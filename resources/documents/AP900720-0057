(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard T. Boggs meditated to calm himselfas he sat in the electric chair for 12 minutes before he wasexecuted for the 1984 murder and robbery of an elderly neighbor.   Head tilted back and eyes closed, Boggs walked slowly into thedeath chamber at 10:50 p.m. Thursday. He appeared sedated, butstate Department of Corrections spokesman Wayne Farrar said Boggs,27, had not taken any tranquilizers.   ``He was meditating,'' said Farrar. ``He was into meditation.''   Guards strapped Boggs into the wooden chair in the basement ofthe State Penitentiary, placed a brown leather mask over his faceand attached electrodes to the crown of his head and his right calf.   Comforted by prison chaplain Russ Ford, Boggs, his shaven headstill tilted backward, occasionally touched thumb to fingers on hisupwardly cupped hands as he waited for his execution, which tookplace shortly after 11 p.m.   Prison officials said that condemned prisoners are usually notkept waiting on the chair but had no immediate explanation for thedelay.   Earlier in the evening, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused tocommute Boggs' sentence to life in prison after the U.S. SupremeCourt denied a stay.   The execution was the first during the 6-month-oldadministration of Wilder, a former death penalty opponent whosuccessfully pushed for an expansion of the state's capitalpunishment law this year.   Boggs was sentenced to death for the Jan. 25, 1984, robbery andslaying of his Portsmouth neighbor, Treeby M. Shaw, 87, whom he hadknown all his life.   She had just poured tea for Boggs when he beat her with a metalbar and stabbed her because he needed money for drugs, he toldpolice. He took diamond rings from her fingers and family silverfrom the house.   Boggs' back arched as he was hit with the first 2,500-volt surgeof electricity. The electricity was administered for 55 seconds,stopped for 5 seconds and turned on for an additional 55 seconds.   Boggs, who had no final words, was pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m.   The execution was the ninth since Virginia resumed executions in1982 and the 135th nationwide since the Supreme Court reinstitutedthe death penalty in 1976. It was the 15th this year.   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams turned down Boggs'request for a stay of execution Thursday morning and a three-judgepanel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rulinglate in the afternoon.   Defense lawyers claimed the state's electric chair mightmalfunction and that Boggs suffers from brain damage.   Boggs' attorney, David Bruck, told Williams that Virginia'selectric chair is virtually identical to the one in Florida thatmalfunctioned during the electrocution of Jesse Tafero in May.Flames and smoke appeared from under the man's head covering.   Florida officials contend that the problem was that a syntheticsponge rather than a natural sponge was used under the hood. Theyhave replaced the sponge, but defense attorneys who argue that thechair is still not fixed are continuing to raise objections toexecutions in that state.</TEXT></DOC>
