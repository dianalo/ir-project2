China, India and other populous developing nations embarking onmass production of consumer goods containing chlorofluorocarbonsreason that since the West invented and produces most of theozone-destroying chemicals, the West should pay to replace them.   Despite the split, the 123 countries at an internationalconference on the ozone layer agreed pressure is on scientists andindustry to find safe alternatives before more damage is done to thefragile atmospheric shield.   William Reilly, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,said the three-day conference that ended Tuesday sparked as muchpublic discussion as any international environmental issue since the1985 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.   ``We are all in this together,'' he said. ``We're all going tohave to find ways to collaborate in cleaning this mess up. Itaffects us all.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the conference host,said all countries, including financially strapped Third Worldnations, must do their part to save the ozone layer.   ``It is not a case of some countries asking other countries toact,'' she said. ``It is a case of every country taking action ...No one can opt out.''   Chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in aerosol propellants,refrigerants, air conditioners, fast-food cartons and computersolvents.   They are stable and non-toxic when released into the atmosphere,but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20 miles to thestratosphere, their chemical bonds are broken apart. Scientists saytheir chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more of the sun'sultraviolet rays to reach Earth, causing more skin cancer and eyecataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.   Related chemicals known as halons, used primarily in firefightingequipment, cause the same damage, but are 10 times as efficient atit.   ``Even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer werebanned tomorrow, ozone depletion would continue for more than adecade and it would take our planet something like 100 years toreplenish the ozone already lost,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, an OxfordUniversity-educated chemist.   Chlorofluorocarbons also trap heat and warm global temperatures,a process known as the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' which already isthought to be responsible for climate changes.   More than 1 million tons of the damaging substances are producedannually, mostly by the United States.   Several companies are working on substitutes, including theAmerican chemical firm Du Pont, which is the world's largestmanufacturer of chlorofluorocarbons, and Britain's Imperial ChemicalIndustries. Some are working together to complete toxicity tests andenvironmental assessments required by governments.   Du Pont says it has ``candidate alternatives'' for all majormarkets and hopes to market them by the mid-1990s. Reilly saidAmerican carmakers told him they plan to use substitutes inair-conditioning systems of their 1994 models.   The United States and the 12-nation European Community havepromised to try to ban those chemicals by 1999 _ surpassing thegoals of the 1987 Montreal Protocol which requires they be halved bythe turn of the century.   The protocol has been ratified by 33 countries. Another 20countries told the conference they will sign up, and 14 are thinkingseriously about it, said Britain's Environment Secretary NicholasRidley.   Japan said it will consent to an international prohibition onproducing and using environmentally harmful chemicals, said JapaneseEnvironment Agency Director General Masahisa Aoki.   ``If an agreement by each country regarding total abolishment canbe reached by the end of this century, Japan will agree to it,'' hesaid.   China and India, which have not signed the Montreal Protocol,urged Western nations to create a new international fund to helpthem acquire technologies to replace the chemicals.   Prince Charles, long a defender of the environment, backed theThird World countries' call.   ``While we simply must eliminate CFCs ... we must not do so byforcing developing nations to forego some of the benefits ofindustrialization which developed countries have enjoyed for solong,'' said the heir to the British throne.</TEXT></DOC>
