As the demise of the Soviet empire lets the air out ofthe Cuban economy, he is finally paying the price for servingso many years as a hireling to Communist bosses in Moscow.With their subsidies and military presence, they kept himpolitically alive but on a short leash. Now he, and the Cubanpeople, will pay the price for the country's lack ofaccomplishment during its years as a Soviet satellite.   This prospect faces him because of the news from Moscowyesterday. Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet president and nominativechairman of the governing State Council of the new Union ofSovereign States, told U.S. Secretary of State James Bakeryesterday that he intends to begin pulling 11,000 Soviettroops out of Cuba.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gorbachev informed the U.S. Secretary that futurerelationships between his country and Cuba will be onlypolitical and economic, which presumably means that they willno longer be military. Quite likely, Mr. Gorbachev thinks henow has more important fish to fry than listening in onAmerican telephone conversations with the help of thesophisticated Soviet military-communications facility inCuba. This spying plus the Soviet bombers and submarines thatuse Cuba as a base have been a significant annoyance to theU.S. over the years, and at times a genuine threat.   Mr. Baker thought Mr. Gorbachev's move would do wondersfor public opinion in the United States, a mild hint thatAmericans might now be more friendly toward granting economicaid to Moscow. So Mr. Castro becomes the odd man out. TheRussians will have a better chance at getting Western aid.Castro's aid from Russia is dwindling away, a victim of thefailure of the Communist system he served so loyally.   His own system, propped up for so long by Sovietsubsidies, is breaking down too. As an AP dispatch reportedyesterday, &quot;virtually everything available in Cuba isrationed, from food to paper to shoes, and long lines forscarce items are a common sight in the capital city ofHavana. On Monday the Cuban government voted to begin tobaccorationing and said it will start rationing cooking gas onSunday.&quot;   The Journal's Jose de Cordoba reported from Havanayesterday that the government is now trying to crank up jointventures with foreign capitalists to help replace lost tradewith the East Bloc. Still, the head of Cuba's committee foreconomic cooperation calls capitalism &quot;a trap for whoeverwants to fall into it.&quot;   Indeed, Mr. Castro says Cuba will remain a Communistcountry, and he no doubt will adhere to his passionate hatredof all things Yankee as well. None of which will representmuch trouble for anyone other than the Cuban people.   Castro's days as the mastermind of the communistrevolution in the Caribbean -- which had one great, buttemporary, success in the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua-- are numbered. How long Cubans will be willing to sufferabject poverty in support of their generalissimo's passionsis an open question. But the likely answer would seem to be,not much longer.</TEXT></DOC>
