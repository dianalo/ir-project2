The unit was designed by Atomic Energy of Canada,Ltd(AECL) of Canada, who also perfomed overall project management forthe plant construction under the provisions and arrangement of the relevantcontracts. The gross electrical output of the plant is 678.7 MWe andthermal output of the reactor is 2061 MWth. While these figures leadto lower plant eficiency than LWR counterparts, unit energy cost forfuel is more favorable than LWRs because natural uranium is utilizedfor the fuel bundles, some of which are already being fabricated domestically.Annual capacity factors for 1983 and 1984 could have been improved, iftwo major planned outages for the modification works on steam generatorinternals and one major forced outage form the heavy water spill incidentcould be eliminated. The heavy water spill incident in November, 1984brought plant staffs many lessons to learn and many things to contemplate.Unique design concepts and features such as on-power refuelling, poisonprevent mode, versatile plant control system built around digital computersand power step back/set back logics may be credited for these relativelygood plant performances. Human related factors such as staff's technicalcapabilities and strong will toward good performance were other elementswhich could not be overlooked.</TEXT></DOC>
