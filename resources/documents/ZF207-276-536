 The system has been developed by Proteus, a companyformed two years ago with funding and management provided by Imseco MedicalServices.andP;  The company is composed of academics who have research facilitiesat the University of Manchester's Institute of Science andamp; Technology, theLondon School of Tropical Medicine, and INRA, Paris, as well as working incollaboration with the Strathclyde Unit for Drug Design.andP;  The minimumrequirement for running the software is a daunting 32Mb of memory, and 2Gb ondisk - well it does need for example to store all known DNA structures - andit is designed for use Norsk Data's 5000 Series of super minicomputers, fromwhich it can be linked to Norsk Data terminals or to IBM PS/2s at the front,to a Transputer bank for neural networking, to Silicon Graphics workstationsfor graphics and, via Fortran, to a supercomputer such as a Cray for back-endintensive arithmetic if it is required.andM;Metabolic rateandM;The BioEngine is described as a highly integrated system ofandM;software and hardware embodying theoretical methods and an expert systembased on use of empirical data.andP;  It enables design to start at the researchstage, so that whole new molecules can be created, which do not necessarilyexist in nature.andP;  Consequently, it can design new drugs and chemicals basedon chemical and bio- technological products.andP;  For, although it is geared forbiological applications, work with the chemical applications company FrazierWilliams has led to a design that can work in a variety of disciplines.andO;Thus, it can work with flexible molecules such as TRH which control the humanmetabolic rate, and create new variants to be used in the treatment ofstrokes.andP;  Because the BioEngine enables design to enter at an early researchstage it can also screen the feasibility of projects.andP;  The pharmaceuticalmarket at which the product is largely targeted is very fragmented with 30major companies such as DuPont and ICI, and hundreds of smaller specialisedbio-technological companies.andP;  Each new pharmaceutical product costs about#100m and 12 years to develop and complete trials.andP;  Computer-aided drugdesign remains an embryonic field, but it is one that has enormous growthpotential as the time taken to bring a drug to market stays constant and thecosts of research and testing continue to soar.andP;  It is also just the kind ofmulti-disciplinary activity at which Britons, given the chance, excel.andP;  Andone small British company announced last week that it had created aningenious collection of applications that promise to take the process ofcreating new drugs by computer several steps forward.andP;  The announcement wasalso the first bit of really good news for many months for the thoroughlychastened flagship Norwegian computer manufacturer Norsk Data A/S, whoseminicomputers were chosen ahead of machines from many of the more glamourousmanufacturers by virtue of the fact that they are much easier to microcode soas to optimise performance of what is an extremely large and complex piece ofsoftware.andP;  Katy Ring found out all about it.andP;  Proteus believes that theBioEngine can reduce the cost of drug development for small companies by upto 90% and cut two to three years time off the number of development years,thus enabling companies to reach the patent stage earlier.andP;  For example,Proteus, which itself is in the business of drug design has alreadyregistered a number of patents, including a synthetic peptide-based vaccineagainst AIDS.andP;  Although toxicity tests still have to be carried out for drugsdesigned on the BioEngine, the company claims that its product is green inthat it reduces animal experimentation at the research stage.andP;  Another of theproduct's features highlighted by Proteus was the fact that it is driven byGlobal, a &quot;fifth generation&quot; programmingandM;language and expert system.andP;       Machine learningandM;This system enables the computer to learn from and with the scientist, makingit a handy tool for companies short of chemical physicists, molecularbiologists and so on, since they can store solutions on disk for the drugdesigner to use.andP;  Indeed, the BioEngine is being promoted as more of aconcept than a fixed system because it is open-ended in design.andP;  Proteusapproached Norsk Data for a joint marketing agreeement, rather than DEC(which is active in this market in partnership with the US company Polygen(CI No 629)) on the grounds that it is easier to change the microcode on theND5000 Series than it is on VAXes, which means that the software can reachCray speeds on Norsk Data boxes for some tasks.andP;  The start-up kit for a smalllaboratory or a company running a pilot project would probably be in theregion of #25,000, which would include the software, a Norsk Data superminifrom the ND5000 Series, the requisite communications materials as well asconsultancy.andP;  The first such kit is going in to an unidentified Europeanpharmaceutical company in June, and while the initial market for the kits isthe pharmaceutical industry, the systems will also be targeted at theagro-chemical and veterinary science industries - an animal neutering agentis currently proving successful in animal trials.andP;  With the launch of theBioEngine both Norsk Data and Proteus are looking, in the long term, to asizeable chunk of the designer drug market, a market in which IBM and DEC arealso interested (CI No 1,177).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
