The meetings, which were aimed at a possible out-of-court settlement of the multibillion dollar legal battle between the Hunts and 23 U.S. and foreign banks, have included only the big bank units of Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover Corp., both of New York. They each have two large portions, totaling about $270 million, of the loans to the Hunts' Placid Oil Co. and Penrod Drilling Co. that defaulted on the borrowings last year.    The sessions have been held in secrecy since last fall. But in the last few days, the other lenders have discovered the sessions and they are fuming. They accuse Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover of going behind the backs of the other banks at a time when all the lenders and their lawyers meet regularly to share information and plot legal strategy. If Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover are speaking for all the others, &quot;they did it without portfolio. I don't like it,&quot; one source close to the other banks said.    Late Friday, attorneys for RepublicBank Corp., the Dallas-based lead lender for the $773.3 million Placid loan, sent a stern letter to the Hunts' attorney informing them that other banks can't speak for it.    Sources speculate that the Hunts might be attempting to reach a solution with banks that they may perceive to have been most accommodating in the loan negotiations. For example, it is understood that RepublicBank, among others, has taken a harder line toward repayment of the Hunt loans than some of the other institutions.    Spokesmen for Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the discussions. A spokesman for the Hunts said he couldn't confirm that they took place, but he added, &quot;There hasn't been a settlement offer made at any time.&quot;    In an attempt to quiet the protests, Manufacturers Hanover hastily called a meeting of other lenders for today at a New York hotel. And Hunt bankers said they expect a packed, testy round. To say the other banks are angry &quot;would be an understatement,&quot; one banker said. &quot;At some of these bank meetings, I wish I was elsewhere,&quot; he added. &quot;This is one I wouldn't want to miss.&quot;    Banks weren't the only ones excluded from the private talks. Stephen D. Susman, one of the Hunts' lead attorneys, said he didn't know about the discussions until he started hearing the other banks' objections. But Mr. Susman said he isn't troubled by the meetings. &quot;It seems like good sense to me. Intelligent people in litigation ought to be talking to people to try to resolve it,&quot; he said.    Sources said the Hunt officials who attended the meetings have been cooperative and conciliatory with their bankers. That would be in contrast to what some sources say has been a rocky relationship between the Hunts and their lenders over the years.    It is understood that none of the Hunt brothers, Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar, attended the meetings. But F.C. Vickers, trustee of the Nelson Bunker Hunt trust estate, has attended some of them. Bunker, the eldest of the three brothers, is influential in plotting family strategy. His trust as well as those of William Herbert and Lamar control Placid, a big independent oil producer, and Penrod, which owns one of the biggest offshore drilling fleets in the world.    All of the banks have been battling with the Hunts ever since Placid and Penrod lenders refused to restructure their loans when oil prices plummeted a year ago, and the Hunts sued the banks in federal court here seeking $13.8 billion in damages.    The Hunt companies accuse the banks of trying to financially strangle their operations by reneging on promises to renegotiate their loans, of antitrust and banking law violations, among other things. The banks, which called the loans and countersued, deny any wrongdoing and several accuse the Hunts of stalling for time.    The Hunts and the banks would have plenty of reasons to try to settle their lawsuits. So far, the Hunts have lost almost every major round in court. To block a bank foreclosure, the brothers were forced to put Placid and Herbert Hunt's trust under the protection of federal Bankruptcy Court last August.    Since then, Placid, once the Hunt brothers' private domain, has been scrutinized by bank lawyers, creditors and a federal bankruptcy judge. Last week, for example, Judge Harold Abramson, of the federal Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, ordered Placid to cut its overhead expenses by 10% a month for three months beginning March 1. And additional Placid funds can't be spent on a controversial project to drill for deep oil in the Gulf of Mexico, without court approval.    For the banks, attorneys estimate that legal fees for all of them are running as much as $5 million and $6 million a month. Mr. Susman predicted his monthly fees will average about $500,000, and that doesn't include other legal fees charged by another group of lawyers who represent Placid and Herbert Hunt's trust in bankruptcy-law proceedings. What's more, lawyers on both sides say the case is being drawn out. It was filed in Dallas federal court last June, but depositions won't start until this spring and it's unlikely the case will be tried before year's end. </TEXT></DOC>
