Fishing was terrific, and if it kept up we'd be heading for San Diegowith a full hold in a few more days.;    Then the skipper, Neal, woke up witha toothache. By that evening the pain from his swollen jaw had put himcompletely out of commission.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Venture  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A CHECKLIST FOR OUTINGS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the active lifeOutdoors  </MEMO><TEXT>     He took as much aspirin as he dared, but it didn't help. There was noalternative. We had to leave the fishing grounds and head for San Diego, aboutfour days running time.;    Neal mentioned the toothache to the skipper of anearby boat over the shortwave radio, and he promptly told us to comealongside, he had something that might help.;    The tiny bottle he gave uscontained oil of cloves. A drop on the infected tooth didn't kill the pain butmade it sufficiently bearable for us to stay out and fill the boat with fishbefore heading in.;    Neal had the tooth pulled when we arrived in San Diego,but two bottles of oil of cloves were aboard when we left on the next trip --one for us, the other just in case someone else needed it.;    THE STORYillustrates that no matter how well we plan, it is the unplanned event thatcan ruin a trip, especially into the outdoors. Even Neal thought he hadeverything covered, even a toothache.;    Two years ago I was on a backpacktrip into the Marble Mountains. On the trip in, we hiked from 2,000 feet up toa lake at 6,000 feet. The climb was hot, tiring work. We looked forward to thereturn trip because it was all downhill. At first we enjoyed the easy walkingbut after a couple of hours our feet, pushing against the front of our boots,became blistered and painful.;    When we stopped for a break, one of thehikers handed us each a patch of a soft, white fabric called moleskin andshowed us how to wrap our feet to protect our toes from chafing against theboots.;    The moleskin made the rest of the trip bearable.;    Sometimes itisn't the presence of an item, but the quality that can make or break a trip.Once it almost cost me my life. I always carried matches with me, just incase, but on a one-day hunting trip a few years ago I grabbed a book of papermatches rather than dig around for my lighter.;     BEFORE THE end of the dayI was lost and soaked to the skin by an icy rain that was turning to snow. Itried to start a fire, but the paper matches just fizzled and went out. I waspast the point of shivering as hypothermia set in.;    I would probably havedied that night if I hadn't crossed paths with another hunter who had turnedup the wrong road. Now I carry wooden matches dipped in paraffin, a patch ofstriking paper and a Bic lighter in a small, sealed jar.;    I also learnedearly on to carry a double-bladed folding camp knife in case one blade breaksor becomes dull.;    An extra pair of shoe laces don't take up much space,either. It may not be for your boots, but for a companion's. A lot of itemsthat can fit in a hip pocket can be day savers. A chocolate bar or a smallvial of sunscreen or mosquito repellent. An extra pair of socks in case yousoak yours while fording a stream. How about a light wind breaker? A small barof soap?;    You don't have to create a survival kit. But next time you takean outing, whether it's for an afternoon or a week, stop to consider some ofthe problems you might encounter, then prepare for them.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dale Lackey column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910815  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  649  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 15, 199100228051,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
