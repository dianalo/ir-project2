The first offer, from the insiders, would have totaled $17.6billion. The second, from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., was for $3billion more, an amount more than the assets of companies such asWang Laboratories or Inland Steel.   The huge difference brings up many questions, including thefundamental question of how value is determined. But even this isnot as intriguing as another, which is: What is the responsibilityof corporate officers?   On an even larger scale, questions are arising about what somecritics see as a no-man's land of regulation that is allowing someof America's biggest companies to disappear, with unusually hugebenefits to a relative few.   The insider question, while perhaps not the most important, isincreasingly meaningful in light of the concern about tradingactivities of those who have access to inside information, i.e.,information not available to the public.   Nobody, for example, is more privy than those who run companies.Corporate officers know meaningful things not available to thepublic, its employees, its shareholders, and competitors forownership.   They know which parts of the company are likely to do best; notjust the divisions, but the plants within the divisions and thedepartments, too.   They know which parts must be sold, which kept, which developedinto new profit centers. They are aware of products not yet onstream, of personnel to be promoted, of opportunities to be seized.   Knowing all this, however, does not necessarily put them in aposition to make the best offer to the company's shareholders in aleveraged buyout. It might, in fact, make it even more difficult topresent the best offer.   By its nature, that is, a leveraged buyout is among other thingsan attempt by buyers to get the maximum leverage, to obtain theutmost for the least, and even to benefit personally in a way moreprofitable than any other available.   Confronted with a buyout situation, does the corporate officerlook out for the best interests of the company and its shareholders?Or of himself? Does a management seeking to buy the company work toboost the company _ or does it wait until the deal is complete, thusmaking it a better deal for them?   Buying out companies has become a prop under the current level ofstock market prices, a rage that accounts for much of the dailyactivity. Researchers now study candidates for buyout rather than acompany's sales and earnings. Speculators buy not for earningsprospects but in anticipation of an offer.   The main defense of buyouts is that they maximize shareholderinvestments and get rid of complacent management, but there areother sides to that story, too.   That they immediately raise trading prices can hardly be denied;but often the company is headed for dismemberment and sale, meaningthe high per share price is a one-time thing. There are no furtherincreases. Dividends may cease.   At the same time, many of these shareholders appear to benefitmore than they really do. Long-term investors, for instance, have nochoice but to sell, thus incurring capital gains taxes thatotherwise would have been deferred.   Most observers also concede that complacent management is atleast put back on its toes. But sometimes a company is vulnerable,at least temporarily, not because of poor management but because itis gearing up for the longer term.   Critics of buyouts say that other aspects of the phenomenon arenot handled any better by regulators.   Bondholders can be devastated by sharp declines in value. Equityis often replaced by low-grade debt. Workers may lose jobs.Communities may lose taxes. The economy might lose some of itsstrongest international competitors.   As the takeover battle rages, the questions mount. Is all thisthe reconstruction of corporate America, as sometimes is said, ormight it be its dismemberment?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Oct 27</NOTE></DOC>
