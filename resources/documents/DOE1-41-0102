Skin is a major interface between the body andits environment and is a potential portal of entry for numerous environmentalchemicals, drugs, and other agents, some of which exhibit local toxicand/or tumorigenic effects in cutaneous tissue whereas others have beenshown to exert toxic effects in extracutaneous tissues. In recent yearsit has become quite clear that organ-specific toxicity including carcinogenicresponses are dependent upon metabolic events that occur in the targettissue itself. It is reasonable to assume that the balance of activatingand inactivating enzymatic pathways in the skin would be a major determinantof the amount of carcinogenic metabolites available for initiating oncogenicresponses in cutaneous tissue. A number of investigators have shown thatimidazole-containing compounds, including certain widely used drugs (e.g.cimetidine, benzimidazole, antifungal agents) can alter hepatic xenobioticmetabolism by inhibiting microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenaseactivities. Others previously reported the inhibition of hepatic microsomalBP-metabolism and its covalent binding to DNA in vitro by clotrimazole.Topically applied clotrimazole is currently used throughout the worldin medical practice for the management of a wide variety of superficialdermatophyte infections. Because of its proven record of safety, thepotential effectiveness of clotrimazole as an inhibitor of the metabolismand carcinogenicity of PAHs in the skin is of great potential interest.The studies described here are conducted to assess the anticarcinogenicityof clotrimazole in mice.</TEXT></DOC>
