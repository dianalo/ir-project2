Among the biggest and most heavily traded OTC stocks -- those on the Nasdaq National Market System -- short interest declined by a slight 0.8%. That drop was about the same as the previously reported declines on the New York and American stock exchanges for the month.    Leading the short-interest decline among bigger Nasdaq stocks was Intel, whose short position tumbled to 1,130,338 shares from 6,269,690 the previous month. Intel, one of Nasdaq's major stocks with a market value of about $5 billion, was the subject of a favorable cover story in Business Week this month.    The fissure between the National Market System stocks and the others isn't unusual. In mid-August, the previous time short interest was released, the smaller stocks had registered a big short-interest decline out of proportion with the market-system stocks and those of the exchanges.    The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, recognizes how the more volatile smaller issues can throw off the overall short interest data. That is why since March it has provided separate data for the market-system issues and for the smaller stocks not on that system.    Short sales generally are bets by brokers and investors that a stock's price will fall. This is usually done by selling borrowed shares that are replaced later; if the replacement shares cost less than those that were sold, the short seller makes money.    Short interest is the number of shares borrowed and sold, but not yet replaced.    Although a big short position indicates speculation that a stock's price will fall, many market watchers view a healthy amount of short selling in the market as being bullish, because shorted shares must eventually be replaced through buying. Changes in short interest in some stocks may also be caused by arbitrage; for example, an arbitrager may profit during some merger situations by buying stock of one company involved and shorting the other.    According to the NASD data, short interest in 2,483 National Market System securities as of mid-September totaled 150,027,195 shares, compared with 151,213,610 shares in 2,486 issues for August. The September short position represents 1.99 days of average daily trading volume, up from 1.8 days the month before.    Short interest in 1,269 smaller or lightly traded securities not on the market system totaled 56,360,838 shares, compared with 48,344,085 shares in 1,242 securities for August. The average daily volume was 1.59 days compared with 1.16 a month before.    Besides Intel, other big Nasdaq stocks with short interest decreases included Jaguar, whose position fell 335,242 shares to 225,838, and Apple Computer, whose position declined 219,303 shares to 902,408.    Returning to its familiar No. 1 position on the Nasdaq shorts chart after a month's absence was LyphoMed, whose short position increased 51,378 shares to about four million. Intel had displaced LyphoMed at the top of August's list.    Some short sellers bet correctly on Regina. The stock had a major increase in its short position -- to 328,098 shares, 20 times the previous month. On Sept. 21, a few days after the short interest data released yesterday were compiled, Regina shares plunged 58.8% on a negative earnings and sales forecast.    The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Sept. 15 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Aug. 15.
