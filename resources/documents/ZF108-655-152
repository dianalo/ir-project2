(DP/Translator )andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT>Product:   D/P Publisher (Computer program) (computer programs).andO;Topic:     Language TranslationSoftware MigrationForeign Languages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In 1989, after using it inhouse for several years, Intergraph acquired PC-andVax-based language translation technology from Worldwide communications(previously known as Weidner Communications) and hired some of that firm'sdevelopers.andP;  Intergraph has ported the software to Unix, added severalcapabilities (such as support for multiple dictionaries), enhanced the userinterface and announced DP/Translator.andP;  In June, the firm will releaseversions that translate English to either German or French.andM;DP/Translator runs on any Intergraph Clipper RISC-based hardware platform.andO;Although it is designed to work well with DP/Publisher, it can also run as astandalone application, inputting and outputting ASCII text.andP;  Its base priceis $10,000 per language pair.andP;  The more powerful the server on which it willreside, the higher the price.andM;Each language module contains a core dictionary with roughly 12,000-14,000words and 2,500-3,000 phrases.andP;  The user must enhance this core withdictionaries for each intended application.andM;Up to six dictionaries can be employed at once; the user can specify theorder in which they should be accessed for a given job (with the coredictionary generally being used last).andP;  Ranked fists of dictionaries can besaved and reused.andM;DP/Translator can create (in a variety of formats) files consisting ofprocessed words that were not found in a dictionary.andP;  These files can be usedas input to update the dictionary.andM;When adding a word to a dictionary, the user specifies the source and targetwords and the part of speech.andP;  Other information is then requested, dependingon the part of speech (nouns can be animate or inanimate, verbs can bespecified as transitive or intransitive, etc.) and on the languages involved(for instance, the user must identify a German noun's gender).andP;  Lists ofhomographs and idioms are also editable.andM;A single-key operation lets the user open a window, type some text and seehow it would be translated.andM;Files can be queued for batch translation.andM;Fluent, no; reasonable, yes.andP;  We tested the English-to-German moodule'sperformance on sentences of varying lengths and complexities.andP;  We used manytechnical terms that were unlikely to be in the core dictionary; as weexpected, they often baffled the program.andP;  It had more success withnontechnical terms (although it sometimes entered the wrong synonym for aword that had multiple meanings).andM;The resulting text isn't grammatically perfect; a fluent speaker of thetarget language will still have to examine and polish it.andP;  However, that jobwill be simpler than with the PC-based translation programs we have seen.andO;(On the Gratech stand, we saw a demonstration of Globalink Language Services'PC-based German-to-English module; because the translation was done in thereverse order, we can't compare apples to apples, but DP/Translator's Germanresults were far more accurate than Globalink's English ones.)andM;As an example, here is one English sentence (chosen at random from our Drupapreview issue-Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  15) and DP/Translator's German rendition:andM;Interset is one of the leading European suppliers of multiuser compositionsystems targeted at the book and journal setting market, as well asapplications where there is a major demand for quality composition ofextensive batch and interactive pagination.andM;Interset ist einer der fuhrenden europaischen Lieferanten von multiuserGestaltung Systeme targeted am Buch und dem Tagebuch Einstellung Markt, sowieAnwendungen, wo es eine gross [DP/Translator used the proper &quot;esszet&quot;character, which our production system cannot reproduce, to represent thedouble s] ere Nachfrage nach Qualitat Gestaltung umfangreichen Stapels undinteraktiven pagination gibt.andM;In this sentence, the program didn't recognize three English words:&quot;multiuser,&quot; &quot;targeted&quot; (&quot;target&quot; was in the dictionary only as a noun) andpagination.&quot; Any unrecognized words arc brought over in their original form.andO;This translation is far from accurate, but the basic sentence structure hasbeen converted well, and adding a dictionary with industry-specific termswould cure most of the mistaken vocabulary.andP;  Another way to reduce errors isto use simpler text in the original language; a DP/Translator user win soonlearn which constructions it handles well and which ones it struggles with.andM;Working with DP/Publisher, the program translates all available text-frombody copy, tables, etc.-and then submits the resulting text to DP/Publisherfor automatic repagination.andP;  This translation takes place in the background,freeing the workstation for other tasks.andM;The German-to-English and French-to-English modules are scheduled for aSeptember release.andP;  Intergraph plans to add at least one more language everythree months.andM;DP/Translator is not a quick fix for &quot;good enough&quot; translation.andP;  It requiresthe user to learn it deeply and to actively enhance it (by addingjob-specific dictionaries).andP;  Anyone willing to invest the time will reap morebenefit than from any other translation system we've seen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
