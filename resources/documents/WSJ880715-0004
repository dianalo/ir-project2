Goodrich Co., having completed its move from the tire business, posted second quarter net income of $60.4 million, or $2.30 a share. That's a 58% jump from a year earlier and the highest net Goodrich ever has recorded.    A year-earlier, profit was $38.3 million, or $1.54 a share, when it was aided by a $10.5 million tax gain.    &quot;Needless to say, we are extremely pleased with the performance of virtually all of our chemical and aerospace businesses,&quot; John D. Ong, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. &quot;We are demonstrating a strong track record for the new B.F. Goodrich.&quot;    Sales rose 18% to $621.7 million from $527.5 million.    For the first half, the plastics, specialty-chemical and aerospace concern reported earnings of $97.7 million, or $3.70 a share, on sales of $1.19 billion. Year-earlier net was $42.1 million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $991.6 million.    In the quarter, Goodrich sold its half-stake in the Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Co. for $225 million and announced its intention to sell nearly all its remaining industrial products interests.    To reflect these moves, the company reported a $3.8 million gain from discontinued operations for the quarter and a first-half loss of $600,000 from discontinued operations. </TEXT></DOC>
