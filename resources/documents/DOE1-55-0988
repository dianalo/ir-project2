It addresses current methods used by regulatoryagencies and the U.S. Department of Defense to establish water-qualitycleanup levels, and provides insight from representatives of water utilities,industry, regulatory agencies, and citizens groups. The report also reviewsthe use of models and other methods for estimating health risks at hazardous-wastesites, and looks at the roles of hydrogeology, engineering, risk assessment,and toxicology, and regulatory strategies in hazardous-waste-site management.</TEXT></DOC>
