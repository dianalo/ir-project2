While installationof scrubbers is expensive (300 US$/kW), reconstruction along clean coallines at a cost of 100 billion US$ promises to yield 1/4 of the new powerneeded in the next 30 years in the USA and to reduce emission of sulfurdioxide and nitrogen oxides. Examples of fluidized bed furnaces withvibrating and circulating beds under atmospheric and elevated pressuresare discussed and compared with conventional systems as well as systemscombining gas turbines with steam boiler systems. The latter system isexpected to increase efficiency by 40%. Recent achievements in applicationof coal gasification to power generation are also reviewed. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
