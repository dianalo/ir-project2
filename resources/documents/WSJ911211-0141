With a series of presidential decrees issued over theweekend, Mr. Yeltsin essentially took control of the nation'svaluable natural resources and repudiated the role of theSoviet central banking authorities. He also outlined numerousradical reforms including currency convertibility andrepatriation of profits for foreign businesses.</LP><TEXT>   Such moves virtually force any other republics hoping toremain in a union with the vast Russian Federation to followsuit, thereby hastening the pace of reform. Key Yeltsinadvisers believe that a go-it-alone approach is the only wayto circumvent remaining central institutions such as theState Bank and the Bank for Economic Affairs, as well asCommunist leaderships in the Central Asian republics, thatcontinue to block reform.   Details of certain decrees are still unclear, but what isessentially an internal battle for economic supremacy isalready having international repercussions. Decreesintroduced in the Russian Parliament Friday stated thatRussia is taking over control of Soviet gold reserves,precious metals and diamonds, and oil exports, which are thenation's main collateral for more international credit.   On the eve of another Moscow meeting between Sovietcentral authorities and deputy finance ministers of the Groupof Seven industrialized nations, Russia reiterated its pledgeto repay existing Soviet debt but announced it wouldn't honorany new debts incurred by the Kremlin after Nov. 15. TheUkraine, Kazakhstan and Byelorussia joined that declaration.   Western lenders have insisted that they will deal onlywith a unified bank, not with each republic separately.&quot;Yeltsin's idea is to take all the debt and all the reservesand recreate the U.S.S.R. State Bank into a State Bank ofRussia and the Soviet Bank of Foreign Affairs into a Russianone, without changing their status but with him controllingthem,&quot; says Igor Sadikh, chief editor of thegovernment-backed Russian Information Agency. Western bankerswho urge support for the Soviet State Bank, he said, &quot;do avery bad service to this country and its economy becausethese two banks are arms of the Communist Party. They blockall reforms.&quot;   Mr. Yeltsin's decree on oil stated that Russia willimmediately review and revise all oil-export licenses. Russiaprovides 90% of the oil production and most of the naturalgas output of the Soviet Union, which itself is the largestoil producer in the world. The news drove gas oil, or heatingoil, and crude oil future prices sharply higher Friday inLondon and New York.   Details of the decree made available yesterday byindividuals close to the Russian government showed that thecriteria to be used in the review make it likely that manyWestern agreements will remain intact. Within 10 days, thelicenses will be reviewed so as to assure fuel supplies forRussia this winter, while fulfilling republican stateagreements, international governmental agreements, andtreaties concluded in exchange for food, medicine, ortechnical advice.   Exports of oil this year are expected to drop in half to50 million tons, leading some analysts to predict that thereview is unlikely to cause further sharp cuts in exportcontracts. Rather, the review is designed to take charge ofuncontrolled trading by centrally run enterprises orindependent businessmen.   &quot;There have been rumors of this for a long time,&quot; said aShell International Petroleum Co. official in Moscow. &quot;Wedon't know yet if the decrees will affect us.&quot;   The problem of oil exports reflects two underlyingstruggles now simmering in Russia: a sharp controversybetween advocates of maintaining the union and proponents ofa go-it-alone Russian policy, and Russia's battle with otherrepublics for dominance.   The Kremlin's chief economist, Grigory Yavlinsky, forexample, argues that Russia made a terrible mistake indecreasing oil exports this year because it has cut into hardcurrency earnings, which are essential to paying off theSoviet Union's foreign debt. In sharp contrast, the architectof the Russian reform program, deputy prime minister YegorGaidar says that Russia's domestic needs must be met first soas to avert a political crisis.   At the same time, some senior Russian and central adviserssay that the main aim of the decree is to stop otherrepublics from buying Russian oil at subsidized internalprices and selling it for hard currency abroad. The newdecree says export licenses will be given only to producers,almost all of which are in Russia.   A similar wrestling match is under way over gold. Russia,which produces 67% of Soviet gold, has now claimed control ofthis resource, notwithstanding the theory that republics in anew union will jointly divide debt obligations and resources.   Central Asian republics worry that Russia is trying for adominant position, but are nearly powerless to fight back.For decades, their wealth of natural resources has eithergone undeveloped or been off limits to the local population.The largest gold-mining region in Uzbekistan, which provides25% of Soviet gold, is a completely sealed-off compound withits own airstrip, staffed totally by Russians from Moscow,says Tair Tairov, a Moscow-based expert on Central Asia.   &quot;Not only this decree, but everything Yeltsin is doingseems to be proof that Russia wants to be the only heir towhat's left of the Soviet Union,&quot; says Mr. Tairov.   Mr. Tairov and others also doubt recent reports on Sovietgold reserves that place the total at 240 million tonsinstead of 370 million tons. Over the weekend, RussianParliament member Alexander Orlov said there are actually noreserves left at all.   But a report in the government daily Izvestia Saturdayprinted documents showing that some five tons of gold hadbeen smuggled abroad in the past six weeks. Mr. Tairov arguesthat Soviet and Russian officials are trying to play down thegold reserves so as to avoid demands from republics to sharethem.   Russia will take over the money printing presses withinthe republic and set its own foreign exchange rates, pavingthe way for issuing its own currency. Enterprises will nolonger be obligated to pay 40% of their hard currency incometo the central bank; instead they will pay an undeclaredpercentage to a new Russian central bank to establish hardcurrency reserves.   &quot;Ruble rates against foreign currency, established by theState Bank of the U.S.S.R., are not valid on the territory ofthe Russian Federation,&quot; the decrees read.   As this economic battle surges on, an almost patheticeffort to create a political union continues, led byPresident Gorbachev. Russia and six other republics agreed inprinciple last week to form a new Union of Sovereign States,but Russia's actions already threaten to refute the spirit ofsuch an agreement.   The Ukraine, which many agree would be the key to thesuccess of any such union, decided not to participate, atleast until it sees the result of an independence referendumand presidential election Dec. 1. Such participation looksincreasingly unlikely because even the more conservativecandidate, Leonid Kravchuk, has said that signing the uniontreaty will be a violation of the Ukraine's declaration ofsovereignty.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          SOVIET GOLD reserve estimates were misstated in an articleNov. 18. The numbers should have been in tons rather thanmillions of tons.   (WSJ Dec. 11, 1991)   911118-0100</TEXT></DOC>
