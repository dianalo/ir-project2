The order, which is expected to be announced soon, is valued at about 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.2 billion).    Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive officer of the government-owned Canadian airline, jokingly told a parliamentary committee yesterday that as &quot;everyone else&quot; has announced the decision, &quot;I don't think we have to.&quot;    His comment was prompted by widespread speculation in recent weeks that Air Canada had picked the 150-seat A-320 airbus over rival planes of Seattle-based Boeing and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. The European plane is built by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium owned 37.9% each by Aerospatiale of France and Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, 20% by British Aerospace PLC and 4.2% by Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    The Airbus order is expected to be announced after the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney approves Air Canada's new five-year capital spending plan.    Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski said yesterday that the federal government wouldn't attempt to influence Air Canada's aircraft selection. &quot;Air Canada's management is quite capable&quot; of choosing aircraft on its own, he told the House of Commons.    The government announced in April its intention to sell to the public 45% of Air Canada's shares. The House of Commons is considering legislation that would permit the sale.    Mr. Jeanniot said Air Canada decided to replace its 727s rather than its older DC-9 planes partly because the 727 is its most &quot;fuel expensive&quot; plane. An Airbus Industrie ad claims the Airbus 320 &quot;burns up to 24% less fuel per seat-mile than its closest competitors.&quot; Air Canada has refurbished its fleet of 35 DC-9s, which are used on short routes. Mr. Jeanniot said the DC-9 remains a &quot;fairly cost effective&quot; plane and he predicted that Air Canada would continue to operate them for &quot;another seven to 10 years.&quot;    Mr. Jeanniot said Air Canada has seen &quot;a fairly substantial growth&quot; in business in recent months, but he said profit margins were &quot;low&quot; on much of the new business. In 1987, the airline had net income of C$45.7 million on revenue of C$3.13 billion.    The executive said Air Canada, the world's 14th-largest airline, was &quot;very bullish about overseas growth prospects.&quot; Within the next two years, Air Canada intends to start service to Nice, France; Madrid; Athens, Greece; Lisbon, and Cairo, Egypt. Charter operations to Venezuela and Ireland are to be converted to scheduled services.    Mr. Jeanniot said Air Canada also wants permission to fly to Japan because of the growth opportunities there. </TEXT></DOC>
