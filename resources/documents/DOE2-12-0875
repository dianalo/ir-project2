<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0875 </DOCNO><TEXT>The instrumental basis for the metrological implementation of radiationmonitoring at the Serpukhov Synchrophasotron is formed by two types ofdetector: tissue-equivalent detectors modelling the regulatory dependenceof quality factor on linear energy transfer, and component detectorsmodelling the dependence of maximum dose equivalent of the individualtypes of radiation or energy group on radiation energy. This choice isconditioned by the fact that there are no standards and reference measuringmeans for the mixed radiation from accelerators and/or its high-energycomponent. The authors hold the view that, if it is impossible to ensureconformity of the measurements to one form within the scope of the stateas a whole or at least of one branch of industry, then detectors shouldbe employed which determine maximum dose equivalent on the basis of physicalprinciples. The tissue-equivalent detectors have been selected as follows:an LET spectrometer and a dose equivalent meter on the basis of a tissue-equivalentproportional counter tube (the latter in conjunction with a nonlinearamplitude converter) as well as a tissue-equivalent ionization chamber.An analog component rem meter based on ionization chambers has been chosenas the component instrument for the accelerator's pulsed radiation. Itcomprises a /sup 3/He chamber with preliminary moderation of the neutrons,an Ar chamber for recording the photons and charged leptons, and a tissue-equivalentchamber for measuring the mixed radiation absorbed dose. In addition,a carbon activation detector on the basis of the /sup 12/C(x, xn)/sup11/C reaction is used to determine the hadron fraction with E andgt; 20 MeVin the dose equivalent. The principles of detector construction, theprinciples of recording circuits, the detector calibration methods, andthe most important algorithms of detector response interpretation aredescribed.</TEXT></DOC>
