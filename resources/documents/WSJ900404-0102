The measure, approved on a 362-59 vote, includes nearly$1.5 billion in new spending authority for a variety ofdomestic programs that Mr. Bush didn't seek, and shiftspriorities within the president's foreign-aid request.</LP><TEXT>   The measure would offset $1.8 billion of the new spendingauthority for the year that began Oct. 1 with rescissions ofpreviously approved Pentagon funding. But it would still add$665 million to the current fiscal year's deficit, which theCongressional Budget Office projects at $158 billion.   Mr. Bush said he wanted the measure on his desk bytomorrow. But swift action in the Senate isn't likely.Democratic leaders there, including Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell of Maine and Appropriations Committee ChairmanRobert Byrd of West Virginia, have expressed reservationsabout the amount of money the president is seeking for thetwo Central American nations.   The House-passed bill would cut Mr. Bush's aid request fora one-time aid infusion for Panama to $420 million from $500million. But it would authorize the $300 million he soughtfor Nicaragua as the first installment of a multiyear aidprogram.   Of the Nicaraguan aid, $30 million would help pay forcosts of repatriating the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who haveagreed to disband before the new democratically electedgovernment takes power later this month.   The supplemental measure also includes $442 million toreplenish Interior Department and National Park Service fundsspent to fight Western forest fires and to clean up oilspilled from the Exxon Valdez, and $111 million in disasteraid related to Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquakelast year and the recent flooding in the Southeast.   An additional $96 million would be provided to make up ashortfall in state unemployment-insurance programs brought onby higher-than-projected joblessness.   In foreign-aid accounts, the bill would provide anadditional $70 million to transport refugees to the U.S. andIsrael from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; $30 millionfor southern Africa, with $10 million each designated for thenewly independent nation of Namibia and to promote democracyin South Africa; $25 million in food aid for refugeesworld-wide; $15 million for Eastern Caribbean nationsincluding Jamaica; $5 million to help repair damage fromHurricane Hugo in three Caribbean nations, and $5 million forSoviet Jewish refugees in Israel.   The measure would remove the U.S. Export-Import Bank'slimitation on medium-term loans. Ex-Im Bank officials saythat would allow them to make more loans to Panama andEastern Europe. Another provision would provide the WorldBank with $1.6 billion in callable capital for use if thebank encountered financial difficulties.   The military-spending rescissions come from a wide rangeof personnel, procurement, research-and-development andconstruction accounts. The largest single item is a $238million cut in the production at a Louisiana facility ofexplosives used in shells.   About $212 million would come out of purchases of spareand repair parts, $100 million from slowing down Air Forcepersonnel transfers, and $82.9 million from a personnelfreeze in all of the uniformed services, including the Army,Navy and Air Force reserves and the Army and Air NationalGuards.</TEXT></DOC>
