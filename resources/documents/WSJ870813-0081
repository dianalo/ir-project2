The president said he wanted to reassert &quot;in capital letters&quot; that he didn't know of the diversion of funds.    &quot;Yet the buck does not stop with Adm. Poindexter . . . it stops with me,&quot; Mr. Reagan said. &quot;The admiral testified that he wanted to protect me; yet no president should ever be protected from the truth.    &quot;No operation is so secret that it must be kept from the commander in chief. I had the right, the obligation, to make my own decision.&quot;    Mr. Reagan's speech marked his first extended comments on the Iran-Contra affair since the congressional hearings began in May. His tone was striking in its absence of confrontation. Although he did put in a pitch for his Supreme Court nominee, Robert Bork, and a balanced-budget constitutional amendment, he sought in outlining his agenda for the remainder of his administration to emphasize areas of bipartisan agreement with the House and Senate.    Speaking of the nation, and also of himself, Mr. Reagan acknowledged that the nine months since the scandal broke &quot;have been confusing and painful ones.    &quot;I know you have doubts in your own minds about what happened in this whole affair,&quot; said the president, whose credibility remains damaged by his handling of the controversy. &quot;At times, I've been mad as a hornet,&quot; he said of the diversion scheme. &quot;Anyone would be -- just look at the damage that's been done and the time that's been lost.&quot;    More than ever, Mr. Reagan took responsibility for the controversy, though he continued to portray the affair as a problem of perception as much as flawed policy. His soft-spoken, sometimes hesitant delivery contrasted with the more sharply worded reply delivered immediately afterward by Democratic Sen. George Mitchell of Maine.    And though the president's words suggested he hopes he is putting the affair behind him, it is certain to remain as long the current criminal investigation continues into the actions of his former aides. The president leaves today for a three-week vacation in California, but when he returns to Washington in September he is likely to face a news conference where he will have to deal with many of the details not addressed in his speech.    For the remaining 17 months of his administration, Mr. Reagan outlined an agenda that ran from domestic battles over the budget and the Bork nomination to arms control and a fledgling peace initiative in Central America. &quot;I'm not about to let the dust and cobwebs settle on the furniture in this office, or on me,&quot; he said.    In particular, the president seemed to draw strength from the prospects for an agreement this fall with the Soviet Union to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles. &quot;I am optimistic that we'll soon witness a first in world history -- the sight of two countries actually destroying nuclear weapons in their arsenals,&quot; he said. Mr. Reagan sounded more optimistic about the prospects than some others have recently, however.    He attributed the prospects for this agreement to his policy of building American military strength for the last 6 1/2 years, which he said is allowing the U.S. to negotiate &quot;from strength.&quot;    Regarding Central America, Mr. Reagan said he remains &quot;totally committed&quot; to the Nicaraguan insurgents, but he didn't specify what he thinks should happen to the guerrillas under the negotiations currently being considered. This ambivalence was reflected in the speech, and Mr. Reagan appeared torn between the diplomatic initiative and his loyalty to the Contras and their conservative allies.    &quot;We have always been willing to talk,&quot; Mr. Reagan said at one point, but then added: &quot;We have never been willing to abandon those who are fighting for democracy and freedom.&quot;    Among domestic issues, the president emphasized first his support for Judge Bork, whom he described less as a conservative champion and more simply as an &quot;important intellectual addition&quot; to the Supreme Court. &quot;His nomination is being opposed by some because he practices judicial restraint,&quot; Mr. Reagan said of the confirmation battle ahead in the Senate this fall. &quot;Now, that means he doesn't put their opinions ahead of the law,&quot; the president said. &quot;He won't put his own opinions ahead of the law. And that's the way it should be.&quot;    Mr. Reagan again made a pitch for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, but he made his request without threatening to veto appropriations bills, as he has in the past. He was silent on taxes and sidestepped the efforts of Republican allies in Congress to revise the Gramm-Rudman law to force immediate across-the-board deficit reductions. Instead Mr. Reagan put the balanced-budget amendment forward on its own as a bargaining chip of sorts, promising that in return for an up-or-down vote on the proposed measure, he would agree to negotiate &quot;on every spending item in the budget.&quot;    The Iran-Contra hearings this summer before Congress aired often-bitter differences within the administration, and Mr. Reagan made reference to these in discussing shipments of U.S. weapons to Tehran.    &quot;I let my preoccupation with the hostages intrude into areas where it didn't belong,&quot; Mr. Reagan said, addressing the underlying criticism that the policy became one of swapping weapons for Americans held in the Mideast. Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger both predicted &quot;that the American people would immediately assume this whole plan was an arms-for-hostage deal and nothing more,&quot; the president said. &quot;Well, unfortunately their predictions were right.&quot;    The decision to raise the &quot;arms-for-hostage&quot; issue had been debated by White House advisers in preparing Mr. Reagan's address, and the speech avoided any legal judgment on the actions taken by the president's former aides.    Responding to Mr. Reagan for the Democrats, Sen. Mitchell, a former federal judge and a member of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee, spoke almost in counterpoint, emphasizing the questions of law raised by the controversy and the need for accountability. &quot;The Iran-Contra scandal is about the rule of law,&quot; Sen. Mitchell said. &quot;Another basic principle of our democratic system is accountability,&quot; he said, &quot;which means simply that public officials, like private citizens, are responsible for the consequences of their acts.&quot;    &quot;The mistakes were not only in the execution of policy,&quot; the senator said, drawing Mr. Reagan in directly and bringing the issue back to the current confrontation in the Persian Gulf. &quot;The major mistakes were the policies themselves,&quot; he said, &quot;and the policies were the president's.&quot;    &quot;The president personally approved in writing the sale of weapons to Iran,&quot; Sen Mitchell said. &quot;That was a mistake, a mistake . . . that worked against our interests in the Persian Gulf, a mistake so grave that Americans now risking their lives in that region face the terrible possibility of an attack by a nation we've helped arm.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
