The Italian agency said the buses were burned inside thecompound of the Montalto Di Castro nuclear plant and were owned bythe Central Nuclear Consortium, which is building the facility 50miles north of Rome.   Strong Socialist Party opposition to resuming construction atthe plant was one factor that led to the resignation of ChristianDemocrat Premier Giovanni Goria Friday night.   Goria, leader of the coalition government since August, resignedtwice before, the last time in February, but agreed to stay on tohelp pass the national budget. The budget was passed Thursday andGoria had been expected to resign next week. Politicial leaderssaid he decided to quit immediately because of the controversy overconstruction at the plant here.
