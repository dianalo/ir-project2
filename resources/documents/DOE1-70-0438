Theauthor explores the reasons for this and suggests that most of the resistanceis political. Private generators say they are being restricted by poortariffs that Area Boards pay for their electricity, and that the Governmentunderplays the use of CHP because it might undermine the case for expansionof nuclear generating capacity put forward by the Government and theCEGB. It is suggested that CHP needs a large influential group (suchas the Department of Energy or the CEGB) to stimulate more interest init, and that ETSU has not devoted enough money to publicise CHP. Theauthor suggests that the market for small-scale CHP includes any manufacturingindustry or public building with a high heat load for about 15 hoursper day - in such cases a payback period of 3-5 years is likely. Privatisationof the ESI will be a watershed for small scale CHP - price increaseswill make in-house generation more attractive, but recent tariff changesmay continue to make private generation and export non-viable.</TEXT></DOC>
