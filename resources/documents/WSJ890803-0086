Lee agreed to pay $25.15 million in penalties and disgorgement as part of a settlement of civil insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    However, the deal with Mr. Lee leaves largely unsettled an important issue raised earlier in the year by the SEC's vigorous pursuit of his assets: whether a U.S. agency has the right to seize assets from foreign bank accounts.    Mr. Lee's settlement is the third-largest in SEC history. In 1986, Ivan F. Boesky, who also pleaded guilty to an insider-trading related charge, paid $100 million to the SEC. In 1987, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., a unit of General Electric Co., paid $25.3 million to settle charges of insider trading and other securities-law violations.    In its civil complaint filed last year, the SEC alleged that from 1987 to early 1988, Mr. Lee traded on inside information supplied by Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., a former analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The SEC charged the scheme made more than $19 million in illegal profits.    Mr. Wang pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to related criminal charges and is serving a three-year prison term. Earlier this year, he settled civil insider-trading charges filed by the SEC by agreeing to disgorge $127,600 in allegedly illegal profits. In settling, Mr. Wang neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.    Mr. Lee's settlement with the SEC, in which he too admits no wrongdoing, doesn't involve a parallel deal with the Justice Department over any possible criminal charges. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on whether he will be indicted.    Mr. Lee, a Taiwan national who has lived in Hong Kong and the U.S., is currently in Taiwan. The U.S. has no extradition treaties with Taiwan, according to the State Department, so it's unlikely Mr. Lee would ever stand trial, if indicted, so long as he remained in Taiwan.    &quot;We are fully satisfied with the settlement,&quot; said Thomas C. Newkirk, the chief enforcement litigator for the SEC in Washington. &quot;It provides for the disgorgement of the full amount we sought {more than $19 million} plus a penalty of more than $1.5 million, plus it provides for payment of $4.5 million in taxes and penalties.&quot;    Lawyers close to the case said the money to pay the SEC was coming from Mr. Lee's bank and brokerage accounts in the U.S., which had been frozen, and funds he has in five banks accounts at a Hong Kong branch of Standard Chartered Bank PLC. Also, Mr. Lee's holdings in two limited partnerships that invest in leveraged buy-out funds had to be sold. Lawyers said the funds were managed by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Tullis-Cook andamp; Co., a Greenwich, Conn., investment-banking firm.    Yesterday's settlement leaves unclear the extent to which the SEC can pursue suspected violators of U.S. securities laws overseas.    Last August, the SEC obtained an order from a federal judge mandating that London-based Standard Chartered turn over about $12.5 million to the court. The agency contended that some of the funds, which were deposited in a Standard Chartered branch in Hong Kong, might be the insider-trading profits of Mr. Lee.    Lawyers said the case was unprecedented because the bank -- which hadn't been accused of any wrongdoing -- was being forced to hand over funds while still being liable under Hong Kong law for returning the money to its depositors.    In its appeal of the order, Standard Chartered was joined by the British government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and several foreign bankers associations. Britain filed a diplomatic protest with the U.S. State Department.    The New York Fed warned that if the ruling stood, depositors and investors might steer clear of banks with U.S. branches, and that such behavior could erode &quot;the central role of the U.S. in world financial markets.&quot; Others argued that the judge's order could damage the competitive position of U.S. banks.    As part of the settlement, the court returned about $13.2 million to Standard Chartered, an amount equal to the $12.5 million it had turned over, plus interest. The bank also received $300,000 toward its expenses of litigating the case in both New York and Hong Kong.    Before agreeing to drop its appeal, Standard Chartered insisted that the return of funds be structured legally in an effort to prevent the judge's initial order from standing as a precedent. &quot;It was essential that we demonstrate that this should not stand as a precedent,&quot; said John Dickey, a partner at the New York law firm of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, which represents the bank. &quot;The structure of this settlement combined with the $300,000 payment will provide strong support to any bank in a similar position to Standard Chartered's should the SEC try this again. It constitutes recognition by the SEC that they went too far.&quot;    Mr. Dickey added that half of the $300,000 Standard Chartered received would otherwise have been paid to the SEC. That the SEC gave up $150,000, he contended, further indicates that the agency was mistaken in the course it pursued.    Nonetheless, Mr. Newkirk of the SEC said the settlement &quot;absolutely would not&quot; deter the agency from using similar tactics in the future. He added: &quot;The sequestration order accomplished exactly what we wanted it to do: It protected the assets and kept Lee from succeeding in his efforts to get them in Hong Kong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
