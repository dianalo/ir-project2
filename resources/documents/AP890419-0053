The Independent, a respected daily, said documents sent to aHouse of Representatives panel probing the Dec. 21 bombing showthat Christmas holiday traffic for U.S. embassies had been heavilyre-booked prior to the bombing.   The report noted that relatives of those who died in the bombinghave been angry that warnings of a possible bombing of a Pan Amflight from Frankfurt to the United States were not made public.   All 259 people on Pan Am Flight 103 and 11 on the ground werekilled when the New York-bound Boeing 747 was blown up over theScottish town of Lockerbie. The flight had originated in Frankfurt,West Germany.   ``A private House of Representatives transportation subcommitteememorandum on the documents, which has been seen by TheIndependent, said that it had asked Pan Am for all internaldocuments relating to security procedures and for information aboutwho knew of the threat,'' the paper wrote.   ``Included among the documents it received were internal companytelegrams and memoranda. The subcommittee memo said that one Pan Aminternal request read that `specific details on lost revenue forU.S. State Department officials' were required. A second was arequest for `public information guidelines' in view that about 80percent of holiday traffic of embassy is re-booking.   ``The subcommittee memo, dated 13 March, goes on to say that PanAm needed to be asked what were `the details of lost revenue sincePan Am was obviously keeping track of threat-relatedcancellations.'''   The U.S. government has denied that its officials, acting on thewarnings, had thus avoided Pan Am flights, the report said.   Copies of what The Independent described as a ``supposedlysecret'' alert bulletin from the U.S. Federal AviationAdministration were posted on notice boards at the U.S. Embassy inMoscow on or around Dec. 13.   The FAA bulletin was drawn up after an anonymous caller to theU.S. Embassy in Helsinki said a bomb attack would be made in thetwo weeks after Dec. 5. The FAA bulletin was sent to embassies sothat they could inform foreign governments.   Since the Lockerbie bombing, the United States and the Finnishpolice have maintained that the telephoned warning was a hoax. Butno attempt was made to withdraw the bulletin in the days before thebombing, The Independent said.   Relatives of those who died on Flight 103 have maintained it wasinevitable that diplomats would act on the bulletin, warningfriends and relatives and canceling Pan Am reservations.   On April 7, Clayton McManaway, the U.S. ambassador-at-large forcounterterrorism, told the U.S. Senate: ``That is not true,'' thenewspaper note.   The report said McManaway pointed out then that 31 U.S.government personnel died in the bombing.   He added that the decision of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to postcopies of the warning was not in accordance with U.S. governmentpolicy and that steps were being taken to prevent it happeningagain.</TEXT></DOC>
