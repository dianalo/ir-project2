(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge on Thursday approved thedemolition of eight buildings in two housing projects in acompromise that was struck after a proposal to knock down nearlyfive times as many high-rises drew fire.   In addition to demolishing buildings containing about 1,900apartments, the agreement between the Newark Housing Authority andtenants groups calls for the renovation or construction of more than3,000 apartments for poor people.   Nearly $3 million in federal Housing and Urban Development fundsare committed to the renovations and construction.   The city originally had planned to tear down 3,900 buildingscontaining about 5,700 units. Tenants and advocates for the homelesssaid the plan would swell the number of homeless people in Newark.   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise tentatively approvedthe plan on Aug. 17, but delayed final approval until Thursday togive officials time to distribute copies of the pact to tenants andfederal housing officials.   ``There was some disagreement, but none of the parties involvedwanted to jeapordize the HUD funding in the agreement,'' said thejudge, whose courtroom was packed with tenants and many on theauthority's long waiting lists.   Under the agreement, buildings containing 1,506 apartments in theColumbus Homes project and about 400 at the Kretchmer Homes will bedemolished. Most of the units in those two projects are alreadyvacant.   The pact requires the city to break ground for the 1,776 newunits it has promised to build before beginning demolition atColumbus Homes and to repair and fill 1,632 vacant apartments beforedemolition at the other project.   Many of those attending Thursday's hearing took the opportunityto complain about the housing authority's efforts to providelow-income housing.   About one-third of Newark's 316,000 residents receive publicassistance. The housing authority is the eighth largest in thenation with 13,000 apartments.   The original plan to destroy most of the city's high-riseprojects reflected a trend toward low-rise public housing, which isconsidered more manageable by many officials.</TEXT></DOC>
