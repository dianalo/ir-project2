We have no spare telephone wire pairs.andM;Absolutely!andP;  Data over voice is an old technology.andP;  The copper telephonewires have lots of bandwidth available at frequencies higher than those usedby the human voice and ears.andP;  You can attach devices that I call &quot;dog-whistlemodems&quot; to each telephone and pump data to the PC down the hall at 19.2kilobits per second while you use the same local lines to call downtown andorder a pizza for lunch.andM;These modems send high-frequency signals over the copper wires, instead ofthe audible tones regular modems use.andP;  These high frequencies won't passthrough a voice telephone switch, but they will ride the copper wires rightup to the voice switch.andP;  Then you pick them off with another data-over-voicemodem.andP;  In addition to the modems, you will need some kind of data switch toroute the PC traffic.andP;  The folks from Newbridge Networks, PerformanceTechnology Development, Rose Electronics, or Itron have switches that areeconomical for installations from four to hundreds of nodes.andM;It sounds like the only problem you might have is getting the bureaucracy togive you access to the telephone closet so you can attach data-over-voicemodems to the copper wires before they go into the voice telephone switch.andM;Several companies make data-over-voice modems, but Applied SpectrumTechnologies in Minneapolis has put a lot of effort into learning how to linkPCs through them.andP;  Give them a call at (612) 379-7114 for more information.andM;TECHS disk-based library is aandM;handy reference tool for LANandM;installationsandM;My company is in the system integration business.andP;  A growing portion of ourwork involves installing LANs, and some of our biggest problems areincompatibilities among network cards and other devices in the PC.andP;  Is thereany single source of information about memory addressing, interrupts, andother points of conflicts?andM;The technical support staff of the companies that make network interfacecards keep a lot of information about incompatibilities.andP;  But I know thefrustration of being put on hold to wait for technical support.andM;One product you should investigate is TECHS, marketed by I.C.D.S.andO;(InterConnect Data Systems) of Anaheim, California.andP;  TECHS is a databaselibrary of products--mainly hardware--combined with a point-and-shootinterface.andP;  The library includes information on many network adapter cards,NetWare, and other LAN products.andM;Through the TECHS interface, you can query the library on knownincompatibilities among products and, more importantly for a lot of LAN work,on how to change variables such as the memory address, IRQ address, and otherfactors.andP;  One of the most impressive features of the package is its abilityto bring up a diagram of the adapter card showing DIP switch and jumperlocations.andM;Two possible drawbacks to TECHS are that it isn't cheap and that it doesn'tcover every piece of hardware ever created.andP;  The first criticism is relative.andO;The basic package lists for $995.andP;  A subscription service providing updatesto the database is $50 per month.andP;  If you are in the business of handlingtechnical problems, that isn't a lot of money for a reference data set.andP;  Thenext version of the software will include the ability to enter your own datainto the library so that you can expand the information on products you usefrequently or include proprietary ones.andM;The folks at I.C.D.S.andP;  have a demonstration diskette.andP;  Phone them at (714)777-7700 for more information.andM;An e-mail anomaly--and a betterandM;way to monitor program usageandM;I encountered a problem with the electronic mail system in Novell's NetWare,Version 2.0a.andP;  My name is spelled Allan, and if anyone told the Novell mailsystem to SEND MEMO TO ALLAN, the mail system found the word ALL followed byextra characters and refused to send the mail.andP;  It assumed that the userwanted to use the ALL feature to put mail into every mailbox but made atyping error.andM;I refuse to change my name to suit the computer, so I created a group namedALLAN with myself as the only member.andP;  I did not bother to give the group anytrustee rights, as none are necessary.andP;  I can now receive mail since the mailprogram sees a group named ALLAN, but it will still send mail to ALL users.andM;I also have a comment on the March 15, 1988, issue, in which Greg Campbellgave a tip to restrict the number of individuals using a program to thenumber of copies legally owned.andP;  This is a very clever idea, except for oneshortfall.andP;  If the power to the PC workstation is disrupted or the PCfreezes, the copy is not returned to the &quot;library.&quot;andP;  Copies appear to be inuse when they re not.andM;Another problem I have with this method is that it will not allow users onthe network anything but read, open, and search rights to the program'sdirectories.andP;  I get around this by creating the FilenamX.IN and Filenam.OUTrights in a directory where all users can read and write, such as the maildirectory.andM;Another good group name you may want to consider using in such circumstancesis EVERYONE.andM;Your comments about Greg Campbell's software-metering program are generallycorrect.andP;  Users with later versions of NetWare, Banyan's VINES, and someother LAN operating systems should be aware that an EXECUTE ONLY right isavailable for application programs.andM;An alternative to Greg Campbell's no-cost batch files is called TURNSTYLEfrom Connect Computer, which you can call at (612) 944-0181.andM;This $195 program uses a small (7 to 10K) resident module running in each&quot;borrowing&quot; workstation.andP;  The resident module periodically updates a commonfile on the server.andP;  If the file is not updated within a given period oftime, the program assumes that the borrowing machine has quit operating andcredits the software copy back into the pool.andP;  It might take 5 to 15 minutesto recognize an inactive machine.andP;  The program also can create reports on howoften programs are used and who uses them.andM;More characters in the passwordandM;foils intrudersandM;Sometimes simple adjustments can make a big improvement in LAN security.andO;Astute users intent on mischief quickly realize that the SUPERVISOR log-inname on Novell's NetWare SFT (system fault tolerant) 2.1 LANs grantsunlimited power.andP;  All that's necessary is to guess the correct password.andM;Limiting the number of consecutive incorrect log-in attempts is an excellentsecurity feature, but a patient penetrator can try a limited number oflog-ins at frequent intervals without alerting the security orerror-reporting system.andM;A simple trick to throw persistent network hackers off the scent is to allowthe normal user's password length to remain at the default setting of fivecharacters.andP;  Then set the SUPERVISOR's password length to six, seven, or morecharacters.andP;  Now both the password itself and its length are unknown.andP;  Thissimple adjustment easily makes a break-in an order of magnitude moredifficult.andM;It doesn't matter if your network is in the Pentagon or in an advertisingagency, the threat of mischief or espionage is always there.andP;  Securityconsultants recommend using large passwords and changing them often.andO;Obviously, adding characters to the password exponentially increases the oddsof using educated guesses to break in.andP;  Of course physical protection ofpasswords is important, too.andP;  Crooks don't have to guess very hard if thecurrent password is written on a desk calendar.andM;Productivity TipandM;IBM's Token-Ring wiring scheme isn't considered good because of itsthroughput or because of the &quot;orderliness&quot; of its protocol.andP;  It's goodbecause you can connect together everything Blue with it--today.andP;  For manypeople, that's good enough.andM;Here's one alternative to theandM;TeleVideo Systems PCS1 cloneandM;We operate terminals that emulate the PC screen and keyboard, which areattached to slave cards in the host.andP;  Each terminal has a standalone parallelprinter attached.andP;  We use both the COM port and serial host port on somestations for a second serial printer, mouse, and modem.andP;  The TeleVideo PCS1terminal supports all of these functions concurrently.andM;My dealer tells me that TeleVideo stopped selling these terminals and wecan't find a suitable replacement.andP;  We tried TeleVideo's new 965 and a Wyse60, but they either don't have enough ports or the right graphics.andP;  We need aterminal with a parallel printer port, a DTE serial port, a DCE serial port,and the ability to display monochrome graphics.andP;  Does anyone make a PCS1clone?andM;The folks at Alloy Computer Products have a lot of interest in ASCIIterminals emulating PC graphics: they market these terminals with theirPC-Slave/286 cards.andP;  But they can't find an exact replacement for theTeleVideo PCS1 either.andP;  One possible alternative is the Wyse 99GT, with twoserial ports and Hercules graphics.andM;With the new multiuser DOS-like operating systems entering the market and theincreasing popularity of slave cards, it is hard to understand why TeleVideopulled the plug on the PCS1.andP;  Believe me, this is a product whose time hascome, not one that should be discontinued.andM;Begin LAN management researchandM;before you install your networkandM;I read your connectivity articles all the time, but is there a book yourecommend that puts all of this information in one place?andM;I wrote a LAN book once.andP;  It, like the three other computer books I wrote,was out of date a month after it hit the shelves.andP;  This experience leads meto contend that magazines are generally the best source of information aboutfast-moving technologies such as LANs.andP;  The majority of book publishers stilltake too long to go from manuscript to bookshelf.andP;  If a product-oriented bookreaches the shelves when people need the information, it was written tooearly to be useful.andP;  If the author waited to gather lots of good informationabout the real shrink-wrapped product, the book is out of date.andM;Some specialty publishers can move the process along more quickly.andP;  Onepamphlet I am impressed with is the LAN Management Setup Guide for NovellNetworks published by Saber Software.andP;  This 26-page publication is loadedwith good information that you should know before you tackle NetWare.andP;  Itincludes information about mapping drives, creating log-in scripts, using theDOS environment, and using batch files.andP;  It makes a great reference forexperienced and novice NetWare administrators.andP;  To order a copy, send $9.95to Saber Software, P.O.andP;  Box 9088, Dallas, TX 75209.andM;When you order the book, Saber also sends you information about their &quot;menusystem.&quot;andP;  They should change the name of the product, though, because it doesmuch more than just present menus.andM;Network Your QuestionsandM;Connectivity Clinic gives you practical solutions to networking problems ofall types.andP;  We'll pay $50 or more for any tips we print, plus an extra $25 ifyou submit your letter on-disk.andP;  If you do, please include a printed copy.andO;We'll gladly answer your questions at no charge, but we cannot answer letterspersonally.andP;  Mail contributions to Connectivity Clinic, PC Magazine, One ParkAvenue, New York, NY 10016, or upload them to PC MagNet (to join, see the &quot;ByModem&quot; sidebar in the Utilities column.).andP;  You may also contact Frank J.andO;Derfler, Jr., via MCI Mail (use Derfler's box named CONNECTIVITY CLINIC).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
