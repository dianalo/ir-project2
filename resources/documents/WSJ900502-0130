But government moves to spur South Korea's ailing economy,including the crackdown by riot police on strikers at HyundaiHeavy Industries' Ulsan shipyard and at Korea BroadcastingService headquarters in Seoul, helped produce a sharpreversal in the Seoul stock market's recent free fall. Thecomposite index gained 29.79 points in heavy trading Tuesdayto close at 718.45, a sharp recovery from the drop of 31.71points, or 4.4%, on Monday, when the index hit an 18-monthlow. Tuesday's rally still left the index 21% below its levelat the end of 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The labor disturbances haven't been about wages or workingconditions. Unionists are battling the government over whatthey consider to be the suppression of democratic laborrights. But the government, saying that the strikesthreatened the economy, sent riot police into Hyundai's Ulsanshipyard at dawn Saturday to end a three-day wildcat strikeby 20,000 workers angered by the government's arrest of unionleaders. The police raid scattered the workers, though asmall group took refuge atop a giant shipyard crane, andothers have continued to fight police in Ulsan streets.Hyundai Heavy Industries is a unit of Hyundai Corp.   Then at midnight Monday, riot police stormed the Seoulheadquarters of Korea Broadcasting System, thegovernment-owned television network, where workers had beenon strike for 19 days to protest the appointment of a cronyof former dictator Chun Doo Hwan to head the organization.Several hundred journalists and technicians were detained.   Peaceful sympathy strikes are under way at Hyundai MotorCo. and other Hyundai group companies in Ulsan. MunhwaBroadcasting Corp., a second government-owned network, isalso on strike to show support for KBS workers. Several othercompanies reported work slowdowns or strikes and subwayworkers at several stations in Seoul reportedly were allowingcustomers to ride free as a way of protesting the governmentcrackdown.   Until the government acted at Hyundai and KBS, Korea wasenjoying a rare respite from labor strife. In recent monthswage settlements have averaged less than 10%, about half therate of the past three years, and there have been only afourth as many work stoppages.   Labor experts expect the disturbances to continue for afew weeks. Park Young Bum of the Korea Labor Institute saysthe government repression challenges the unions to fight backto show they can't be intimidated. &quot;To a large extent, thegovernment provoked it,&quot; he said. &quot;If they win Hyundai, theywin everything.&quot;   Unlike in previous years, public support seems solidly onthe government's side. It has convinced Koreans that thecountry is in an economic crisis and that worker disruptionswill doom any recovery.   To add to Korea's disruptions, angry investors in recentdays have been invading the offices of brokerage firms andsmashing windows and furniture to vent their anger at theplunging stock market. Many brokerage offices are shutteredduring the day and riot police are standing guard outside afew downtown Seoul offices to fend off mobs. Threateningphone calls have been made to brokers, government officialsand newspapers. The Wall Street Journal bureau in Seoulreceived several death threats Monday after a Korean languagenewspaper reported the Journal had quoted analysts as sayingthey thought the market would fall further.   To shore up investor confidence, the government yesterdayannounced that in addition to the anti-strike measures itwould renew crackdowns on real-estate speculation andconsumer-price gouging. The Economic Planning Board orderedconglomerates to sell the undeveloped real estate they areholding for speculation, in the hope that proceeds from theproperty sales will be channeled into stocks and thatinflation, fanned by real-estate speculation, will cool.   The planning board said government efforts to fightreal-estate speculation and other economic problems wouldn'tsucceed if growing labor disputes weren't checked. Somebusinesses have shunned investment in the face of what theysee as excessive demands for wages and other concessions.   Although the government's moves obviously heartened stockinvestors, some brokers and market analysts were doubtfulthat the market's rise would continue. &quot;It's just a temporaryboost,&quot; said an analyst for Ssangyang Investment andamp; SecuritiesCo., one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. &quot;It's notlikely to continue because the economic fundamentals haven'tchanged.&quot;   Meanwhile, a previous plan for Korean securities houses tocreate a pool of cash to buy stocks and prop up the marketappears to be doomed. Securities houses are pressed for cashand have been calling in margin accounts to raise money. Butto settle accounts, customers have had to sell stocks, makingthe market fall further.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT'S choice to head state-runKorea Broadcasting System, Soh Ki Won, identified in anearlier edition as a crony of former dictator Chun Doo Hwan,served in the Chun government between 1980 and 1982. But thegovernment says Mr. Soh wasn't a close associate of Mr. Chun,the post was ceremonial and Mr. Soh had little influence. Mr.Soh later worked with Seoul Shinmun newspaper.
