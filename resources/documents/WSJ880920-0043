Analysts expect Digital also to make an equity investment in MIPS.    The agreement has been expected since last July when Digital confirmed widespread reports it was talking to MIPS about the technology for reduced instruction set computing or RISC-based microprocessors.    RISC is increasingly seen as the best computer design for powerful workstations used by scientists and engineers because it is inherently fast and is especially efficient in running the UNIX operating system that is popular in universities and research laboratories.    Digital had been working on a RISC-based microprocessor design code-named Prism, but it shelved that project. Marc Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said &quot;the reason DEC entered the agreement was a time-to-market consideration. I expect a workstation using the MIPS technology in January. That's at least six months faster than they could have done it&quot; themselves.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Digital fell $2.125 to $92.75.    MIPS was one of the pioneers in the RISC field, and it sells its microprocessors to a number of different computer companies as well as makes computers itself.    Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., the leading workstation maker, and Motorola Inc., Schaumburg, Ill., a major producer of semiconductors, are both pushing their own RISC microprocessors, so signing up Digital, the No. 2 computer maker, is a major coup for MIPS, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
