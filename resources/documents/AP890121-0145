Spraggett, 34, from Montreal, is considered the underdog by mostexperts in this six-game contest with Yusipov, a 29-year-old, whoplays board-three for the Soviet Union behind world champion GarriKasparov and the former world titleholder Anatoly Karpov.   ``Spraggett's not the favorite, but he's not to be underrated,''said Danny Kopec, an American international master. ``He proves thatagain and again.''   By holding the draw, with the black pieces, Spraggett now gains asmall edge because he has three remaining games to play with theadvantage of the white pieces while Yusipov has only two.   The second game of the contest scheduled to finish Jan. 29 willbe played Sunday, with Spraggett playing white. A win scores a pointand a draw a half point.   Yusipov gained a nagging edge from a queen's gambit, but theCanadian managed to free his cramped position with a pawn break onthe 23rd move. With both players short of time, Yusipov forced adraw by repeating the position.   The winner of the contest will receive five-eighths of the$32,000 prize fund with the loser receiving three-eighths.   British grand master Jonathan Speelman is so far the only playerqualified for the semifinal, which is scheduled to be played inLondon in October.   The contest between former world champion Karpov and JohannHjartarson of Iceland will begin Jan. 28 in Seattle. The remainingduel pits Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman with Lajos Portisch ofHungary, which starts in the Belgian city of Antwerp on Jan. 31.   The winner of the candidates' cycle will challenge Kasparov forhis title in autumn 1990.   Spraggett shot to prominence in his previous qualifier withSoviet grandmaster Andre Sokolov. Although Sokolov was expected tocrush the Canadian, Spraggett held on to tie 3-3 and defeated hisopponent in a hair-raising playoff at high speed.</TEXT></DOC>
