Mr. McDonnell said the companies are in talks currently about whether to jointly design and build wide-body and narrow-body jets.    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus are in a tough competition to win customers for a new generation of wide-body tri-jets. The U.S. company is developing the MD-11, a derivative of its DC-10 aircraft, to compete with Airbus' planned A-330 and A-340 longrange jets.    &quot;We have jointly set for ourselves a mid-April milestone to assess where we are and if we are still making progress&quot; in the talks, Mr. McDonnell said in an interview. If the two companies can't agree on a joint venture, &quot;it won't be the end of the world for us,&quot; Mr. McDonnell said.    Although one major airline, Scandinavian Airline System, recently canceled MD-11 orders, Mr. McDonnell said there are still more firm orders for MD-11s than there are for the Airbus planes. He said McDonnell Douglas has 31 firm orders for the planes -- orders for which non-refundable deposits have been made -- and an additional 45 conditional orders or options. He said he knows of no firm orders for the Airbus planes, although Airbus has 90 conditional orders, options and reserve orders.    Concerning first-quarter earnings, Mr. McDonnell said he expects &quot;no big surprises.&quot; In the fourth quarter, earnings were $92.6 million and in the 1987 first quarter net income totaled $43 million, including a charge.    He said it is likely that losses in the companies information systems group will continue until at least the first quarter of 1989. Most of the losses in that group in the past three years have resulted from write-offs of acquisition premiums. Those write-offs end in early 1989, he said.    Mr. McDonnell said the information systems business &quot;presents a significant investment opportunity for us. We have growth possibilities there we don't have in aerospace.&quot;    Mr. McDonnell, who became chairman March 2 upon the retirement of his cousin, Sanford N. McDonnell, said that he believed the company's management structure needed to be &quot;streamlined&quot; and &quot;simplified&quot; and that is why he moved quickly to reorganize top management ranks.    He said actions he took eliminated one management layer and will cause more executives to report directly to him. In the past, the company has been criticized for being too bureaucratic and slow-moving. The new management structure &quot;will shorten the approval cycle and communication cycle&quot; with the company, Mr. McDonnell said. </TEXT></DOC>
