(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IN BRIEFandM;Charging AheadandM;There are a number of variables that go into a mail-order credit cardpurchase.andP;  The bottom line may be that the customer is always right, butthere are extenuating circumstances the customer should keep in mind:andM;* Law: The FTC Mail-Order Rule allows a 30-day period between placement of aprepaid order and shipment.andM;* Processing: Vendors must charge the sale when they check the buyer'scredit.andP;  Electronic credit card processing does not allow for a credit checkand a separate transaction to charge against the card.andM;* Interest: If a purchase is billed well before it ships, ask for a refund ofthe interest you will have to pay on that amount.andP;  At 18 percent per yearinterest, each $1,000 you pay costs about $15 a month.andM;Remember the cliche of someone biting a coin to make sure it's real?andP;  Most ofus don't consider doing that because we assume the money is authentic.andO;Buying by mail takes a leap of faith beyond just believing the coins arereal.andP;  A purchase is made by a buyer for goods unseen.andP;  The merchant acceptspayment for expensive merchandise from a voice reading off a dozen digitsfrom a piece of plastic.andP;  It is admirable that such a seemingly nebuloustransaction not only works, but is an everyday occurrence.andM;But it doesn't always work so well.andP;  It is rare, but there are some occasionswhen customers do not receive the product or service they order within anacceptable time frame.andP;  In some mail-order ads are the words: &quot;We don'tcharge your credit card until we ship.&quot;andP;  It seems to me that not making youpay for something before it is sent should be obvious, but it isn't.andM;The Federal Trade Commission has a law called the Mail-Order Rule.andP;  This rulerequires mail-order sellers to ship the ordered merchandise within 30 days,or offer the buyer a chance to cancel the order and receive a full refund.andO;Under this law, it is legal for sellers to charge your card when they receivethe order, as long as they ship within 30 days.andM;While this practice might be legal under the FTC rule, it is guaranteed tocause some public relations problems.andP;  Imagine receiving your credit cardstatement with a $3,000 computer charge, dated weeks ago when you ordered thesystem, and you have yet to see the product.andP;  Are you going to quietly paythe bill and assume your computer is on the way?andP;  Not likely, and verypossibly, a customer service representative is going to hear about it.andM;While not breaking the Federal Trade Commission's mail-order rule, themerchant has violated its merchant agreement with the banks issuing the card.andO;A typical Visa/MasterCard agreement has very specific language prohibitingthis practice: &quot;Merchant shall present no sales slip until the goods havebeen shipped or the services have been performed in connection with thetransaction.&quot;andM;This clause is put into the agreement to protect the consumer and the bank.andO;You see, banks deposit money into accounts based on the belief that thetransactions have already occurred.andM;The reality of today's consumer-oriented marketplace is that vendros knowthey can't charge the card until close to the time the order is shipped.andP;  Isay &quot;close to&quot; because the operational requirements of processing credit cardpaperwork make it possible to charge a card one day before shipment.andM;Banks offer reduced rates to merchants who process credit cardselectronically.andP;  Virtually all direct marketers use electronic credit cardprocessing.andP;  Here's how it works: After taking orders, inventory is consultedto make sure the items are in stock.andP;  If the stock is available, themerchants use their credit card terminals to call the credit card processingcomputers and verify that the sales amounts are within the cardholders'credit limits.andP;  The payments are then processed.andP;  This all occurs in a singlestep.andM;The system of electronic credit card processing does not allow for checks tomake sure there is credit available against the cardholders' credit limits.andO;It takes a separate transaction to charge the amounts against the cards.andO;Unlike a manual transaction at retail stores, where the clerk calls for anauthorization number and payment is then separately processed from ahandwritte slip, both of these operations happen simultaneously with fullyelectronic processing.andM;This creates a dilemma for the vendors.andP;  The longer they wait between theplacement of the order and the time the credit card transaction takes place,the more likely problems are to occur.andP;  If the merchants have to wait a fewdays, the cardholders might keep charging items on their cards, and therewill be no credit available for the purchases.andP;  This necessitates finding thebuyers by phone--additional time and expense.andP;  The buyers may have had secondthoughts during this period, or perhaps they may have seen something newer orpriced lower.andP;  Lots of things can happen to cause a sale to &quot;unwind.&quot;andM;Have you noticed how some mail-order vendors tout quick delivery?andP;  Now youknow some of the reasons why.andP;  Fast delivery creates a smoother sellingprocess and speeds cash flow, eliminating problems with customers while alsoserving them well.andM;Occasionally, even the most organized of vendors will accidentally charge acredit card before it should.andP;  Perhaps inventory control said the necessarycomponents were in stock, but they actually weren't.andP;  This can happen withsoftware products where the vendors maintain a small inventory of each title,and an error of just one in inventory control can let orders be processedeven though there aren't enough titles in stock.andM;Another example would be a custom configured computer system, ordered andscheduled for assembly on, for example, a Thursday.andP;  Most systems vendorscharge cards before a custom system is built.andP;  Vendors don't want to find outafter the custom system has been built that there is not enough availablecredit on the card.andM;Let's say the credit card is charged on a Thursday morning.andP;  The assembly andtesting process follows, but there is a failure during overnight burn-in.andP;  OnFriday, a new system board is installed, and the system doesn't get out untilMonday.andP;  The final invoice now reads five days after the credit card wascharged.andP;  This may not happen often, but there are a lot of Thursdays, anddelays like this can occur.andM;If your purchase does get billed well before it ships, don't be bashful aboutasking for a refund of the interest you will have to pay on that amount.andP;  At18 percent per year interest, each $1,000 you pay costs you about $15 a monthin interest.andP;  If a $4,000 computer system was on your card for two weeksbefore it shipped, you should ask for your $30 back.andP;  With a $4,000 salehanging in the balance, few vendors would refuse such a reasonable request.andO;Most will be embarrased by the mistake and will rectify it.andM;Imagine ordering a $2,500 notebook computer.andP;  You receive your credit cardbill with the $2,500 charge, but there is no box on your doorstep orattempted delivery notice on your door.andP;  You call the vendor, and it confirmsa mistake was made and your card should not have been charged.andM;Don't panic.andP;  Although the FTC law may give the vendor the right to chargeyour card based on your order, the system is on your side.andP;  You can notifythe credit card company that this transaction has not taken place, and thatyou have not received the merchandise.andM;Your card-issuing bank will then send a chargeback to the merchant's bank,stating that the cardholder does not plan to make payment on thistransaction.andP;  The merchant's bank immediately takes the money out of themerchant's account and notifies the vendors of the charge-back.andM;The merchant can appeal the chargeback but faces a difficult process in doingso.andP;  The reason the cardholder is the default winner in a credit card disputeis the fact that the cardholder is a customer of the card-issuing bank.andP;  Thatbank makes money every time the cardholder uses the card, and the bank isgoing to protect it cardholder's interests first because it wants that creditcard to continue to be used.andP;  A dispute over a mail-order purchase willalways begin with the customer getting credited for the contested amount.andM;Business who make a habit of charging cards before the order is shipped runthe very real risk of having their merchant status suspended or revoked; adeath sentence in this business.andP;  Banks don't like dealing with a lot ofchargebacks, and they get especially nervous with merchants taking moneybefore the sale is made.andP;  If the seller went bankrupt, the merchant's bankwould have to cover all the chargebacks out of its own pocket.andM;The system encourages merchants to behave responsibly with credit cardtransactions, and the result is that most mail-order marketers are verycareful about how they handle these transactions.andP;  The system works.andM;CREDIT CARD USE:andM;RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIESandM;Federal Trade CommissionandM;Mail-Order Rule:andM;Requires mail-order sellers to ship ordered merchandise within 30 days oroffer a cancellation option with a full refund.andM;Credit Card Agreement:andM;&quot;Merchant shall present to sales slip until the goods have been shipped orthe services have been performed in connection with the transaction.&quot;andM;Reality:andM;While according to the FTC, the vendor has 30 days to deliver themerchandise, you credit card bank has your interests in mind.andP;  If you notifythe bank that product or services have not been rendered, it will send achargeback to the merchant's bank, halting payment.andP;  The customer is alwayscredited for the contested amount and the problem is resolved later.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
