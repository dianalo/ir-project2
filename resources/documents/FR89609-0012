The maximum interest rate on the HUD/FHA Section235 insurance programs has been lowered from 10.50 percent to 10.00 percent.Until recently, HUD regulated interest rates not only for the Section 235Program, but also for fire safety equipment loans insured under section232 of the National Housing Act. However, section 429(e)(2) of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, approved February5, 1988) amended the National Housing Act to provide that interest on firesafety equipment loans under section 232(i) of the Act will be ``at suchrate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee.'' Accordingly,these loans, like most other National Housing Act-authorized loans, nowhave their interest rates determined by negotiation. Accordingly, thisannouncement of a change in interest rate ceilings for FHA-insured mortgagesis limited to the Section 235 Program. The Secretary has determined that this change is immediately necessaryto meet the needs of the market and to prevent speculation in anticipationof a change. As a matter of policy, the Department submits most of its rulemaking topublic comment, either before or after effectiveness of the action. Inthis instance, however, the Secretary has determined that advance noticeand public comment procedures are unnecessary and that good cause existsfor making this final rule effective immediately. HUD regulations publishedat 47 FR 56266 (1982), amending 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, contain categoricalexclusions from their requirements for the actions, activities and programsspecified in andSection; 50.20. Since the amendments made by this rule fallwithin the categorical exclusions set forth in paragraph (<T3>1</T3>) of andSection; 50.20, the preparation of an Environmental ImpactStatement or Finding of No Significant Impact is not required for thisrule. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued onFebruary 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not (1)have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governmental agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory FlexibilityAct), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule providesfor a small decrease in the mortgage interest rate in programs of limitedapplicability, and thus of minimal effect on small entities. This rulewas not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations publishedon April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708) pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and theRegulatory Flexibility Act.
