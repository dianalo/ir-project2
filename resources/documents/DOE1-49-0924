The promoter regions of two proto-oncogenes, the epidermalgrowth factor (EGF) receptor gene and the cellular Harvey ras1 (c-Ha-ras1)gene, have been identified and compared in the hope that such an analysiswill clarify understanding of the mechanism by which these genes areregulated. Both promoters were found to be highly G+C rich, and not tocontain a TATA box or a CAAT box in their characteristic upstream locations.Both EGF receptor and c-Ha-ras1 RNAs are initiated at multiple sites.Furthermore, both promoters contain multiple copies of GC boxes (GGGCGGor CCGCCC), which can bind Sp1 factor as determined by an in vitro DNaseI foot-printing assay.</TEXT></DOC>
