Rhone-Poulenc found the residues while doing a survey forthe the Environmental Protection Agency, whose chief interestwas possible ground-water contamination. An EPA spokesmansaid that the residues were found on 10 of 2,600 potatoestested, and that all 10 came from one of 26 fields tested.</LP><TEXT>   Rhone-Poulenc said it found residues at &quot;higher levelsthan the company would expect from proper use&quot; of aldicarb.The company said farmers are beginning to plant this year'spotato crop, and it wanted to spare them &quot;a needless anddamaging `food scare' of the type we've seen in the past.&quot;   Aldicarb, sold by Rhone-Poulenc under the tradename Temik,doesn't have any known long-term health effects. The companysaid that during nearly 17 years of use of the product, ithas never had a report of anyone's becoming sick from eatingtreated potatoes.   The EPA spokesman said residues at the highest levelsfound in the survey could conceivably cause transientflu-like symptoms but shouldn't create any alarm about eatingpotatoes. Although death due to direct ingestion of largeamounts aldicarb is possible, he emphasized that no deathshave ever been associated with any treated foods.   A Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said the company is stilltalking with regulatory authorities in other largepotato-producing countries about how to proceed there. In theU.S., he said, the company won't sell aldicarb for use onpotatoes throughout this planting season and possiblythroughout next year's as research into the residue levelscontinues. The company will continue selling aldicarb, whichkills insects, mites and nematodes, for uses other than thoseon potatoes.   Rhone-Poulenc, the U.S. chemicals unit of Rhone-PoulencS.A., of Paris, didn't disclose its sales of aldicarb, butthe spokesman said cotton growers are a more important marketfor the pesticide than potato growers. Among potato growers,he said, the product has about 15% of the market.</TEXT></DOC>
