In lawyerly language, Drexel's attorneys will say the firm decided to plead guilty to six counts and pay $650 million because prosecutors had otherwise threatened to RICO Drexel out of business before any trial. So after all the hoopla, it comes down to this: The rubber hose of RICO means we may never know what, if anything, Drexel did that broke the law.    This unsatisfying result is just one of the messes left behind for Richard Breeden and Otto Obermaier. President Bush recently nominated the free-market-oriented Mr. Breeden to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last week and just before tomorrow's New York mayoral primary, Mr. Bush officially nominated Mr. Obermaier to be the permanent successor to Rudy Giuliani as U.S. Attorney for Manhattan. These two will have their work cut out to restore the confidence of the market in the common sense and fairness of white-collar law enforcement.    Wall Street and civil libertarians who believe even stock brokers have rights will be relieved when the new guard replaces the old. Aside from the RICOing of Drexel, prosecutorial abuses have included the indicting of innocents Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor; the piling on against small-timer Lisa Jones; the bankrupting of Princeton/Newport before trial; the two mistrials so far in the GAF case; and what is at least gross overstatement about Michael Milken's alleged crimes.    Perhaps federal judges will be the ones who most welcome the change. Consider how Judge Pierre Leval spent last Tuesday afternoon. He had the surreal experience of a defendant pleading guilty to the questionable crime of having been told, &quot;Your Bunny has a good nose.&quot; This was the cryptic message banker Martin Siegel gave Robert Freeman, formerly of Goldman Sachs, in relation to arbitrageur Bunny Lasker's rumors about a 1986 bid for Beatrice. Before he sentences Mr. Freeman in November, Judge Leval might ask his law clerks to look for a precedent where such obtuse language amounted to insider trading. Judge Leval no doubt noticed that Mr. Freeman didn't admit any securities violation, only mail fraud -- whatever that means.    Judge Leval also learned that the prosecutors had no idea what actual harm to the market Mr. Freeman did -- if any. Judge Leval followed the standard practice of asking the prosecutor to estimate Mr. Freeman's potential civil liabilities to victims of his trades. The prosecutor said he didn't know. &quot;Restitution of $50 is a different thing from a restitution of $50 million,&quot; Judge Leval noted. The prosecutor said $50 million sounded about right. An apparently astonished Judge Leval replied, &quot;I didn't mean to suggest that number. I was just pulling it out of the air.&quot; The prosecutor insisted that $50 million was &quot;fine&quot; with him; Mr. Freeman's lawyer, Robert Fiske Jr., said this figure was &quot;off the wall.&quot;    Mr. Obermaier, a former prosecutor, may have something to say about such cavalier attitudes to markets. He has noted the Giuliani-era practice of elevating &quot;parking&quot; and harmless technical disclosure problems to crimes, and even to racketeering. Mr. Obermaier told the National Law Journal in 1987 that the SEC &quot;to some degree has abdicated its role. . . . Criminal enforcement has superseded civil enforcement and with that there has been some distortion of the position that Congress envisioned.&quot;    Mr. Breeden might take Mr. Obermaier's hint, and make the SEC's top goal clarifying its own rules and regulations. Insider trading, for example, remains undefined yet a crime. Ridding the markets of fraud is an important function but one that requires laws that make it clear to both regulators and the regulated what behavior is permissible and what is not.    Mr. Breeden and Mr. Obermaier have had the chance over the past few years to see how white-collar prosecutions sometimes can raise harder issues than murder, robbery and drug cases. Victims often are hard to find. The laws are notoriously vague. The accused often do not even suspect they might have committed crimes. It can only be good for markets to have regulators and prosecutors more attuned to the need for discretion and balance in enforcing the securities laws. </TEXT></DOC>
