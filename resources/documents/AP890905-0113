HaigJr. said in an interview released Tuesday.   Haig, former secretary of state in the Reagan administration anda contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, toldPenthouse magazine he hopes to be campaigning for Bush for a secondterm in 1992.   In the interview, to be published in the magazine's Octoberissue, Haig responded to a question about domestic policy by sayingthat ``the most important thing ... is the deficit.''   ``I think Mr. Bush missed the boat,'' he said. ``It was probablyhis worst mistake in the early days of the administration.''   Haig said he believed Bush made ``a conscious decision to avoidbiting the necessary bullet on the deficit, in order to try tostructure a bipartisan coalition for the major issues facing ourcountry .''   He said recent events including ``ethical extremism'' in Congress``have derailed the coalition and will continue to do so, so he hasnow run out of time for negotiations on the 1990 budget.''   ``He is faced with the imperative of putting in place a crediblefive-year program to bring the United States to solvency,'' he said.``Now that's going to require some additional revenue _ but rememberthe `read my lips' problem?''   Bush repeatedly used the phrase ``read my lips'' during thecampaign to emphasize his commitment not to raise taxes.   In addition, said Haig, a deficit-reduction program ``willrequire a very austere approach to some of the social programs,including the so-called fenced-off areas _ indexing of SocialSecurity, perhaps.''   ``These are very difficult steps for any president who wants asecond term to take,'' Haig said. ``If he had done it in the firstsix months, the consequences of it could have been behind him. Hecould still do it at the end of 1989. If he waits any longer thanthat, it would be asking a politican to do something whichpoliticians are simply unable to do, and that is commit politicalsuicide.''   Haig was asked whether he might be interested in the presidencyin 1992 if Bush, for any reason, did not run.   ``I doubt it,'' he said.   Asked if that meant another bid for the White House was out ofthe question, he said, ``Yep. I'm a Republican ... I hope I'll becampaigning for George Bush's second term in 1992.''</TEXT></DOC>
