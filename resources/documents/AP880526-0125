A vast majority of the Dover seamen of P and O European Ferries,the largest English Channel ferry operator, voted Feb. 2 to strikeover new work practices the company wanted to impose.   Nearly four months later the walkout remains unresolved, and the2,220 workers are bitterly divided.   One side decided in late April to defy the National Union ofSeamen and accept a revised P and O proposal to return to work.   The men and women who chose to stay out lost their jobs.   Some of those who returned to work have found the word ``Scab''scrawled in red paint on their homes. Others have reportedreceiving threatening, anonymous telephone calls.   Brian Young, mayor of the city of about 40,000 people, fearsDover will feel the pain longer after the strike is settled.   ``You're going to get splits in the community'' he said.``People are having to make hard decisions.   ``People rely on each other in an emergency out there when thereis a 10-force gale,'' he added. ``People will remember who didn'tback them up in a strike.''   P and O, which is refusing further negotiations with the union,says 1,100 former strikers are back on the job. The union says it'sonly 250.   Violence broke out on the picket lines April 29, when P and Ooperated two of its 11 ferries with strikebreaking crews.   The company says it now is operating five vessels, two carryingpassengers and three carrying freight, and has brought its workforce back to 65 percent of its previous level by hiring from apool of 8,000 outsiders.   ``What has happened here is a tragedy,'' said striker SteveBartlett. ``I won't speak to them (the strikebreakers) ever again.They betrayed us. They are traitors.''   The strikers say they won't accept the new work rules _ namelymore shifts _on grounds that they jeopardize ferry safety.   The loss of 193 lives, including ferry crewmen, in last year'ssinking of the P and O's Herald of Free Enterprise off Zeebrugge,Belgium, had a profound effect on Dover, whose principal industryis its port, which goes back to Roman times.   But P and O insists nothing in its work proposals is unsafe andthat safety is a paramount issue with the company.   P and O maintains it needs the new work practices to make itmore competitive with the new English Channel rail tunnel, whichwill offer speedier travel between England and France when it opensin 1993.   The strikers, however, believe P and O is trying to destroytheir union with the backing of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative government.   Dover residents who support the opposition Labor Party feelintensely that the chairman of the parent P and O Steam NavigationCo., Sir Jeffrey Sterling, has benefitted from Mrs. Thatcher'scapitalist policies.   Although Dover's economy has been hurt by the walkout, largesegments of the community appear to back the strikers.   ``It's always been a seafaring town, so these seamen have a lotof support,'' said James Moore, a taxi driver.   Mayor Young said shopkeepers donate food to the strikers, whohave set up soup kitchens to guarantee that the seamen and theirfamilies get at least one hot meal a day.   The seamen, who made the equivalent of $20,500 to $31,600 ayear, are having to make do now with a total of about $372 instrike payments from their union.   Crewmen who have gone back to work avoid talking about it toreporters.   ``There are too many reprisals,'' said the wife of one,shrinking away from her front door.   The first crews to go back to work issued a statement sayingtheir decision was based on a desire to save the company from beingsold to foreigners, that they didn't want outsiders to get theirjobs and that the strike was undemocratic.   Hundreds of picketers still wait at the entrance of the docksevery morning for company buses ferrying strikebreakers.   Shouting with fists raised, they have persuaded a handful ofworkers, a few of them in tears, to get off and join them on thepicket line.</TEXT></DOC>
