Maps carried by the guerrillas indicated killings would becarried out in the densely populated Tel Aviv beachfront hoteldistrict where the embassy is located, said the source, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Locations circled on the maps indicated a large Tel Avivdepartment store as another potential target, he said.   Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured in Wednesday's raid,which was masterminded by Mohammed Abbas, the leader of a PLOfaction.   ``During the debriefing (of the guerrillas) ... it wasestablished that one of the targets in the vicinity of the hoteldistrict was the U.S. Embassy,'' the source said.   ``Wherever they can, they try to accomplish a spectacular masskilling. The U.S. Embassy was a good target that would makeheadlines,'' he said.   The comment was the first indication the guerrillas had plannedto attack the U.S. Embassy.   Earlier today, Israel's military intelligence chief was quoted assaying PLO chief Yasser Arafat probably did not know beforehandabout the raid.   The comment by Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak contradicted ForeignMinistry officials who claimed Arafat met last week with Abbas andalmost certainly knew of the planned strike. Abbas leads thePalestine Liberation Front, the PLO faction that claimedresponsibility for Wednesday's foiled attack.   Israel claims Libya helped mount the strike, which was aimed atcrowded Israeli beaches, and Shahak's comments in an interview withthe Yediot Ahronot daily provided the most detailed account yet ofthat alleged involvement.   But a Libyan official today denied Libyan involvement in theraid. Gadallah Azouz el-Talhi, Libya's foreign minister, said:``Some news media claimed that a Libyan ship carried the speedboatsthat tried to go to shore. Libya has no connection at all with theoperation,'' el-Talhi said during a visit to Egypt.   Shahak also said Israel knew ``with complete certainty'' that thePLO has planned attacks on Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel ``inevery possible location and at every opportunity.''   The statement was the first public comment by security officialsabout threats against Soviet immigrants. Israeli newspapers havequoted officials as saying Israel stepped up security because ofexpected guerrilla attacks on Soviet Jews.   Shahak said Arafat probably didn't know about Abbas' plans toattack Israel. ``We don't have information pointing to the fact thathe knew ahead of time,'' Shahak said.   Arafat said Thursday the PLO was not involved in the raid.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on Washington to abandon thedialogue it began with the PLO in December 1988 after Arafatrenounced terrorism.   Arafat avoided condemning the raid outright, and said he couldnot expel Abbas from the elected PLO Executive Committee for theattempted raid: ``He was elected in a democratic way by thePalestine National Council, and only the council has a say on that.''   Abbas' faction said today in a statement issued by its office inBaghdad, Iraq, that it would continue its attacks.   U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown said today that Arafat'sresponse was unacceptable.   ``He has ... attempted to absolve the PLO from responsibility.Rest assured that we're going to continue to look at that very, veryseriously,'' Brown said during a tour of the northern Israeli townof Migdal Haemek.   Israel radio, which carried the remarks, said Brown did not saywhether the United States would end its dialogue with the PLO.   Shahak said the guerrillas involved in the seaborne raid trainedin a camp set aside for them by Libyan authorities on theMediterranean coast.   ``The investigation shows beyond doubt that Libyan militarypersonnel were involved in all stages of preparation,'' Shahak saidin the newspaper interview.   Earlier reports have said the guerrillas boarded a Libyanmerchant ship in Libya's port of Benghazi that also transportedspeedboats to carry out the attack.   ``Libyans helped to move the terrorists to the ship. The shipitself had a Libyan crew, and aboard was a Libyan militaryofficer,'' Shahak said.   The intelligence chief also said some of the guerrillas had beenin Libya for more than two years, and that training for the attackbegan several months ago.   Israeli officials have refused to comment on speculation thatIsrael would retaliate against Libya.   Former military intelligence chief Yoshua Saguy called for such amilitary strike. ``Libya needs to know that, like we reached them inthe past, we will reach them again,'' Saguy told army radio.   Saguy, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wingLikud bloc, also suggested that Israel was reponsible for the April16, 1988, assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir inTunis. The slaying was widely attributed to Israeli commandos, butIsrael has denied any involvement.</TEXT></DOC>
