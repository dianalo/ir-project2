Although there is little argument between Democrats andRepublicans about the desire for congressional remedy for a SupremeCourt decision giving First Amendment protection to flagdesecration, there has been wide disagreement about how that shouldbe done.   The House was taking the first crack at the matter today in theform of the statute pushed by Democrat leaders who don't want to gothe Republican-backed route of amending the Constitution.   ``I happen to think the language even tends to weaken the currentstatute,'' Michel said. The bill would make desecration of a flag afederal offense punishable by fines and imprisonment.   On the eve of today's House action, Republican and Democratsdiscussed an agreement that would allow a vote on the statute aswell as a later vote on an amendment.   These talks came as President Bush traveled to Capitol Hill andhad lunch with former House colleagues Reps. Sonny Montgomery,D-Miss., and John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark. The congressmen saidBush briefly discussed the flag issue with them.   Although Bush made no comments as he left the Capitol, bothMontgomery and Hammerschmidt said they believed the president,despite his preference for a constitutional amendment, would notveto flag-protection legislation passed by Congress.   ``He understands that, politically, members have to have a chanceto vote on a statute,'' Hammerschmidt said.   Montgomery, chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, saidHouse Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told him Friday he would letthe House vote on a flag amendment in November.   ``I think it's pretty locked in,'' Montgomery said.   Montgomery said he would vote for the statute. Until now, manyveterans groups have been pressuring lawmakers to oppose the statutebecause they fear it would preclude a vote on a constitutionalamendment, which they prefer.   Michel sidestepped reporters' questions about the discussionswith the congressional leadership.   Michel said he was ``still working'' with Foley ``with theexpectation we would have the same kind of agreement as is currentin the Senate, where there'll be a vote on the statute and assuredvote on an amendment some time later.''</TEXT></DOC>
