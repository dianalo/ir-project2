(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senior officials at Payless CashwaysInc. are exploring a leveraged buyout of the building materialsretailer, the company says.   But New York financier Asher B. Edelman, who is leading aninvestor group considering a takeover of Payless, said he plannedto ask the company to share information so his group can consider acompeting offer.   Payless made the announcement late Thursday in response torumors earlier in the day that management was considering a buyoutat $30 a share.   The company said in a statement members of its senior managementwere considering submitting a leveraged buyout proposal to aspecial committee of the company's board of directors. The proposal``contemplates per-share consideration valued in the mid-20s,'' thestatement said.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out acompany and then pay off the debt with the target company's cashflow or the sale of its assets.   The company said there was no guarantee that an offer would bemade or, if so, how it would be structured. Officials declinedfurther comment.   If a cash offer of $25 a share is made, it would cost about $840million to buy all of the company's stock.   Payless stock closed at $24.50 in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading Thursday.   Edelman said he planned to talk to his attorneys and thenrequest the information that Payless' senior management was usingto evaluate the company's worth.   ``They have put the company up for sale, and it should go to thehighest bidder,'' Edelman said. ``I would hope to be among thebidders. We want the information that the leveraged buyout is beingbased on in order to have the ability to compete on a level andilluminated playing field against the company to acquire thecompany.''   Payless has been considered a takeover target of a group led byEdelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a privately ownedcompetitor of Payless. The group has not made an offer for thecompany.   The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless' largest shareholder,with about 3.34 million shares, or about 9.9 percent of thecompany's outstanding shares.   David Stanley, chairman of Payless, has said anEdelman-Sutherland takeover would not be in the best interests ofthe company or its shareholders.</TEXT></DOC>
