or scan a document,then the software &quot;reads&quot; the document, converting it from a graphical forminto text that then can be archived, edited, or retrieved for use in otherdocuments, Caere said.andM;OmniPage enables users to scan virtually any kind of document, includingfinancial statements, contracts, magazine and newspaper articles, and programlistings, SCO said.andP;  OmniPage converts the text to ASCII format or directlyto the formats of popular business applications such as Microsoft Word,WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3.andM;Advanced features include OmniPage's ability to select portions of a page forscanning, to separate text and graphics, and to recognize various font sizesand styles, multiple column documents, and spreadsheet formats, Caere said.andM;An international product, OmniPage can recognize 11 languages and can evenrecognize two languages in the same document, Caere said.andM;Bill Morehouse, SCO's OmniPage product manager, said: &quot;OmniPage is aprice-performance breakthrough that brings a high-quality, yet affordablepage-recognition solution to the Unix System marketplace.andP;  OmniPage speedsand simplifies the entry of multiple pages of text, while making the wholeprocess less labor-intensive and less prone to error.andP;  Faster than anytypist, OmniPage scans multiple-page documents at 100 characters per second.&quot;andM;Shipping with the Unix version is the SCO Scanner Runtime Device Driver, sothe Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus printer can be used.andM;On the PC platform OmniPage has been enhanced in the 2.0 version and nowincludes the ability to recognize both text and graphics.andM;OmniPage now includes a gray-scale editor, The Graphic Editor, for image aswell as text scanning, which also allows the creation of black-and-white lineart or continuous-tone images with up to 256 shades of gray, the companysaid.andP;  The new editing software has a set of editing tools that among otherthings allow complex masking, multiple selection tools, rotating andinversion, Caere said.andM;The software also includes LaserGray technology for printing of halftonesthat resemble high-quality photographs, the company said.andM;Caere says OmniPage is the only software to support Hewlett- Packard's (HP)Accupage technology on the HP optical scanner, the ScanJet IIc.andP;  The AccuPagetechnology improves OCR accuracy on poor quality documents, like newspapers,stained documents, and articles with colored or shaded backgrounds, Caeresaid.andP;  The two companies plan to will comarket OmniPage Professional and theHP ScanJet IIc, Caere said.andM;The PC version has expanded text editing capabilities, withwhat-you-see-is-what-you-scanned (WYSISYS) with displays of bold, italic,underline and document formatting directly on the screen, Caere said.andP;  Apop-up verification window allows users to edit a scanned document andsimultaneously view a bit-mapped image of the original page by using theFind/Replace and Spell commands, the company said.andP;  Spell checking is donedirectly on screen, just as it is when working with a word processor, Caeresaid.andM;Caere says the 2.0 version of OmniPage is smart enough to know if thedocument has been scanned upside down, and will flip the document andcontinue scanning.andM;As the only Windows OCR application, OmniPage incorporates Dynamic DataExchange (DDE) for leading Microsoft Windows applications to improve theuser's ability to exchange information with other programs, Caere said.andM;OmniPage recognizes virtually any document, meaning it can convert nearly anynon-styled font in size ranges from 6 to 72 points at a speed of up to 115characters per second, depending on the speed of the computer's centralprocessing unit, the company said.andP;  The software also automatically separatesgraphics from text, Caere said.andM;The new PC version requires MS-DOS, version 3.1 or above; Windows Version3.0; and a Windows 3.0-compatible 80386 system with 4 megabytes of RAM a harddisk with 8 megabytes of storage space, and a Windows-compatible pointingdevice, such as the Microsoft Mouse.andM;OmniPage for SCO Unix is available in dual-media packaging through all SCOsales channels in the U.S.andP;
