This concept is proclaimed proudly in a recentgoverning-party report as the supporting mechanism foreventual separation from Canada. But what was once thought ofas Quebec's golden goose is beginning to look more and morelike an albatross.   Quebec was inspired to travel along this statist route byOntario's own mega-utility, Ontario Hydro, begun in 1906 asthe supplier of subsidized electricity to attract industry.Franklin Roosevelt is said to have been so inspired by thatinvention when he was a New York legislator and governor thathe set up the Tennessee Valley Authority. But Quebec's firststep was even more ambitious: the 1944 nationalization ofMontreal Light, Heat andamp; Power implemented by Maurice &quot;Le Chef&quot;Duplesis, absolutist premier of a society deeply rooted inthe France of the &quot;ancien regime&quot;.</LP><TEXT>   The appropriated hydroelectric assets and potential werethe most capital-intensive in the electricity business. Sothey fed the ambitions of local politicians to borrow andbuild beyond the limit of the domestic capital market. Thegrowth of U.S. institutional investors and a shortage ofmegautilities created a market in the U.S. for Hydro-Quebec'sbonds (provided they are issued in the investor's currency).   The bonds were promoted &quot;as good as triple A&quot; (accordingto 1977 and 1983 Kidder Peabody reports) on the strength oftwo things. First, oil shocks made Hydro-Quebec attractiveand justified its megaconstruction program. Second, theaccounting treatment of the construction program itselfdoesn't charge interest or depreciation until completion.   This has made Hydro more of a hybrid: a combined bank andconstruction company that happens to provide electricity. Thename of the game has been to set electricity rates highenough to meet interest payments. But Hydro needs to minimizethe impact of suddenly being charged all the interestaccumulated on just-completed construction. So, to boostearnings Hydro has been drawing down the water level at damsto the point where net electricity exports should be at theirmaximum.   But the chickens are now coming home to roost. Deductionsof depreciation and interest on recently completed projectsin the past two years lowered earnings again to anemiclevels. Also, last year Hydro found itself with too littlewater to meet demand. Three years ago it began to run downwater levels to pay dividends after several years ofnonpayment. The nonpayment was due to the earnings drop thatfollowed the completion of the construction projects of the'70s and early '80s.   Hydro-Quebec today has more U.S. dollar debt than anycorporation in the industrial world, except for a couple ofthe biggest LBOs. Hydro now plans to double the debt for evenmore grandiose projects as it completes preparations forQuebec's exit from Canada.   A pending electricity-export contract to New York statewas expected to provide the bulk of U.S. dollar income neededby Hydro-Quebec to service and redeem its current andanticipated U.S. dollar debt. This was then expected toreduce the loss of a weak Quebec currency -- made likelybecause of an abominable trade deficit (currently bigger percapita than in any other industrial country).   The fixed rate for electricity under long-term exportcontracts forces Quebec ratepayers to bear the full cost ofQuebec independence. This eventually would raise Quebec'sdomestic electricity rates above those of Canada in general.These increases would come on top of a 5% rate increase nowneeded to pay a just-announced annual fee for thegovernment's debt guarantee, and an additional 30% that wouldbe required for Hydro to operate like a private company(i.e., a commercial return on equity after paying all taxes).   Should New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo aspire to thepresidency, he can't ignore the environmental consequences ofHydro's unavoidable mercury poisoning released as a result ofits expansion. In addition, Gov. Cuomo's environmentalistconstituency will be equally repulsed by Hydro's next phaseof development, which will include flooding an area the sizeof Lake Ontario. This monument to social engineering will bevisible from outer space, like the Great Wall of China.   However, it is reduced demand and low-cost alternativesthat have made the two major members of the New York buyers'group reconsider their participation in the contract. Thetrend among less-leveraged, mainly private U.S. utilities hasbeen toward smaller-scale, new natural-gas and co-generationunits, and toward paying users to free up existing capacity.This has boosted earnings.   Hydro-Quebec is only beginning to catch on -- its betterminds are cloistered in the monastic recesses of 60-yearmega-project planning. The current &quot;discounted&quot; value offuture cash flows diminishes the further they project intothe future. This drives home the significance ofunanticipated technological breakthroughs that undo thebest-laid &quot;plans&quot; to sell hydroelectricity as &quot;costless&quot;after 60 years. Weather and electromagnetic storms, whichinterfere with delivery from ever-remoter locations, alreadyhave caused two systemwide power failures.   Meanwhile, Hydro can't handle a torrent of offers itreceived in response to its request for private-sectorgeneration -- a testimonial to the entrepreneurial vigor ofthe Quebecois. And unlike most other North Americanutilities, Hydro will pay an existing user only a small partof Hydro's cost of any existing capacity the user frees up sothat Hydro can resell it to new users.   Quebec's cultural-protectionist policies have madeHydro-Quebec the only attraction for the foreign capitalneeded to finance Quebec's massive annual net import ofgoods. Quebec has low-balled electricity rates to foreignersto double its aluminum-smelting capacity with littlemultiplier effect on the economy. Hydro's borrowing itselfhas been the machine to crank in most of the foreign capital.Jobs growth gets concentrated in the short-lived constructionsector.   As long as the government both owns and regulatesHydro-Quebec, the fox is in the henhouse. The annual 10-yearplan, dropped this year amid the financial uncertainty, optsfor forecasting the success of government policy. One policyis the vain attempt to reverse if not arrest a populationdecline by heavily subsidizing citizens who have more thantwo children. But this &quot;solution&quot; increases the province'sdebt and isn't significantly stemming the decline ofratepayers. On the other hand, privatizing Hydro-Quebec'sgeneration facilities into competing companies would holddown operating costs, de-emphasize megaprojects to boostearnings, and give the Quebec treasury at least $10 billion.   Hydro-Quebec is the embodiment of Quebec's culturalprotectionism and tradition of not looking beyondself-interest. Is such an institution a suitable energypartner for the U.S.?   ---   Mr. Blohm is an American private investment banker who hasspent half his life in Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
