Gordon Crovitz says &quot;It's Time for Lawyers to Kick theTobacco Habit&quot; (Rule of Law, Jan. 8). Maybe Mr. Crovitz isnot aware, but the last time the cigarette warnings wereupdated, intended language included words such as &quot;kill&quot; and&quot;addictive.&quot; Of course, the powerful lobbyists from thetobacco industry bought off, cajoled and threatenedlegislators and others into weakening that kind of truth.   While it may be believable that &quot;adults&quot; should bearpersonal responsibility for using tobacco products, someoneneeds to remind Mr. Crovitz that many smokers begin theiraddiction when they are quite young, not adults. How much&quot;personal responsibility&quot; would Mr. Crovitz assign to a 12-or 13-year-old?</LP><TEXT>   The same issue of the Journal also mentioned that PhilipMorris has agreed to run &quot;anti-smoking&quot; messages as part ofits sponsorship of a major road race in New York. Maybe Mr.Crovitz would reply to that, &quot;See] See] They really don'twant young people to smoke]&quot; As Fred Rogers might say: &quot;Canyou say `reverse psychology'?&quot; Of course, the tobaccocompanies want young people to smoke; if they don't start aschildren or teen-agers, they will most likely never becomeaddicted.   Clearly, the tobacco industry has become a &quot;genocidesyndicate,&quot; killing 500,000 Americans each year with aproduct that is deadly when used as intended. And they killmillions more each year in other parts of the world. The onlygood coffin nails are those that go into the coffin of thetobacco industry.   David A. Fusco   Executive Director   Arlington Citizens for Clean Air   Arlington, Texas   ---   Mr. Crovitz is disingenuous when he says smokers now suingtobacco companies &quot;are typically people who smoked despiteknowing better.&quot; The tobacco companies are facing lawsuitsnow in large part because they successfully stonewalled onthe health issue for many years and employed hardball PRtactics to challenge and ridicule virtually every scientificstudy that linked smoking to health risks. The tobaccoindustry said in effect, &quot;You haven't proven anythingconcrete yet because you haven't produced the smoking gun&quot; ofdirect causation.   An ironic result of these campaigns was that smokers(including me for several years) were able to rationalize onthe health risk -- &quot;Hey, if smoking causes cancer, what aboutall those old guys who've smoked two packs a day all theirlives?&quot; As a consequence, smokers were lulled into believingthe health risk issue was greatly overblown and kept onpuffing through the '60s and '70s. Meanwhile, the tobaccoindustry, aware that many of its best customers were dyingoff, targeted &quot;replacement&quot; smokers -- young people andblacks. I'm no lawyer, but it seems clear there is now a&quot;smoking gun,&quot; and its pointed directly at the tobaccocompanies.   Garland Bradshaw   Warren, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
