The settlements end a federal case that Revlon brought against Mr. Shelley and a state court suit Mr. Shelley served on Revlon, claiming &quot;wrongful termination.&quot;    Court papers didn't specify the amount Mr. Shelley and two others sued by Revlon will pay, but sources close to the case said it will be about $600,000 of the $1.1 million Revlon was seeking. A Revlon spokesman declined to comment on the settlement, except to say that Revlon wouldn't have to pay anything.    Mr. Shelley's attorney, Michael S. Feldberg, declined to confirm the figure because he said all parties had agreed not to comment on the settlement. Neither side admitted any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.    In July, the cosmetics and health-care company whose parent is Revlon Group Inc. sued Mr. Shelley, its former high-profile vice president, corporate affairs. Revlon claimed Mr. Shelley approved more than 150 invoices for public relations services that were never rendered. Two officers of an outside printing company also were named in the suit and were part of the settlement. The alleged fraudulent activity, Revlon said, occurred from March 1983 to May 1986, shortly before Mr. Shelley was fired.    The public relations executive, who made $124,000 a year at Revlon, became well known by investors and the press during Pantry Pride Inc.'s successful bid for Revlon in 1985. Pantry Pride renamed itself Revlon Group after the takeover and has since sold off most Pantry Pride operations. </TEXT></DOC>
