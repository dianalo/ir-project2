But Mugabe is getting kudos for allowing the probe to take placeat all.   The report's authors are Judge Wilson Sandura and two prominentcivilians who sat for more than two months in Harare's High Court,packed by spectators who enjoyed seeing their leaders squirm underinterrogation.   Some 60 witnesses testified, and even before the report was sentto Mugabe, two Cabinet ministers quit their government and partyposts after being caught lying to the panel.   The usually timid state-controlled media demanded punishment forsome of the other luminaries summoned before the commission, amongthem six Cabinet ministers, two junior ministers, several civilservants and the army commander.   While the probe identified corruption in the party hierarchy, italso won Mugabe praise for ordering some of his staunchest aides toface the embarrassment of being quizzed in public.   ``This could never happen anywhere else in black Africa,'' saida West African diplomat.   The Daily Nation, an independent newspaper in Kenya's capital ofNairobi, praised Mugabe for his openness and suggested that acorruption probe in Africa is as rare as rain in the Sahara.   In a continent where contemporary politicians often behave likeautocratic tribal chiefs of old, scores of Zimbabweans crowded intothe courtroom to snigger, sneer and jeer at the VIPs on the witnessstand.   When Higher Education Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka refused undercross-examination to produce bank statements, the public galleryerupted into laughter and booing.   Angered, the minister pointed at the hecklers, pounded the boxand shouted: ``One fool at a time, please!''   The probe that shook the nation involved the purchase of carsand trucks from the Willowvale assembly plant by ministers andtheir friends at low fixed prices.   The commission investigated allegations that some top officialsused their influence to jump waiting lines for vehicles and thenresold the cars on the black market for up to five times what theypaid.   Zimbabwe, independent from Britain only since April 18, 1980,has suffered a dire shortage of cars because of a lack of hardcurrency. Would-be buyers can wait up to 10 years for a new vehicle.   But the Cabinet last year decided to give some governmentofficials the right to buy one vehicle each at the fixed stateprice.   One senior minister admitted to the investigating panel that hehad helped 38 friends buy cars, but he insisted he had not taken apenny in return.   Army Commander Tapfumaneyi Mujuru conceded he had bought a carand sold it at a profit of about $2,500.   Charges against those allegedly involved could range from pricecontrol violations and sales tax evasion, which usually bringnominal fines, to perjury, which carries a maximum prison sentenceof five years.   Meanwhile, the crusading newspaper editor who lifted the veil on``Willowgate,'' Geoff Nyarota, has disappeared from public view andis staying mum.   Officially, Nyarota was transferred from the Chronicle inBulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, to a public relations jobat the Harare headquarters of Zimbabwe Newspapers Ltd., thestate-controlled group that owns most of the country's papers.   But many readers are convinced the editor's move to a post thatpreviously did not exist was the result of pressure from above.They recall that Nyarota was threatened with detention by DefenseMinister Enos Nkala before the minister resigned in the midst ofthe commission probe.   Many Zimbabweans fear the silencing of Nyarota could mean thatfuture scandals might be hushed up.   But Mugabe has promised the probe report will be made public inits entirety after he has finished reading it.</TEXT></DOC>
