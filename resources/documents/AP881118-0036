Besides, the paddy dikes help control floods.   But for Stephen Gabbert, president of the U.S. Rice Millers'Association, ``Japan's rice policy is a fantastic example ofeconomic distortion and it basically stinks.''   On Thursday, he denounced what he called Japan's ``mythology ofrice'' and said Detroit could just as well have raised theautomobile as a sacrosanct aspect of American society to stop Japanfrom selling cars in the United States.   ``We shouldn't have any sacred or cultural cows in traderelationships,'' he said at a news conference with foreignjournalists. ``These kinds of sensitivities should not be reasonsfor avoiding confronting trade issues.''   Gabbert accused Japan's agricultural cooperatives of being ``anevil empire,'' of raising ``hysteria and shock'' and ofmisrepresenting his case for a modest opening of the market.   He said Japan could start easing some of its social problems _such as high land, housing and food prices _ by liberalizing itsheavily-controlled rice market.   Such salvos have a hard time penetrating the wall Japan haserected around its rice market. In September, the Diet, orparliament, passed a resolution calling rice production ``a majormatter of concern for all Japanese as the basis of maintaining anddeveloping a sound society in our country.''   The resolution firmly rejected U.S. calls to rescind thecountry's ban on rice imports.   The U.S. association proposes that 2.5 percent of the market beopened to imports annually for four years. U.S. producers, with 25percent of their fields now idle, could not take more than 10percent of Japan's market, he said, valuing the U.S. stake at $300million a year.   He said the U.S. rice crop was 6 million to 7 million metric tonsa year. Japan's harvest was 10.7 million metric tons in 1987 but isexpected to fall to 9.91 million metric tons this year because of acool and rainy summer.   If Japan opened its market, he said, urban rice paddies could beused for housing, alleviating the high price of homes and perhapsletting more people live closer to work and reduce the agony ofcommuting.   Rice farmers have inordinate political power, he said, andopening the market would give urbanites their rightful strength.   Gabbert said Japan's rice-based system leads to artificially highfood prices, costing consumers $60 billion a year. If some of thatcash could be spent on manufactured imports, it would cut Japan'stroublesome trade surplus.   International farming statistics show the average price of ricehere is $1.75 a pound, compared with 45 cents a pound for U.S.consumers.   Japanese farmers tend to stay with rice because the governmentbuys their production at a guaranteed price, while other crop pricesfluctuate with the market.   In their defense, the Japanese say the government lowered thecontrol price 5.9 percent last year. The price differential islargely the result of the recent fall of the dollar, they say.   On his 20th visit to Japan in 15 years, Gabbert said he wasexamining the options as his association decides when to refile itspetition accusing Japan of an illegal trade barrier.   President Reagan's administration decided in late October not toaccept the last petition, but warned that Japan must beaccommodating in trade negotiations starting Dec. 5 in Montreal,otherwise Washington may change its mind.   Gabbert said his association may advance the issue after theinauguration of President-Elect George Bush, who said during thecampaign he favored pressing Japan to open its rice market.   It would be a tough decision for Bush, for Tokyo has warned therewill be a ``very violent'' reaction, in the words of Deputy ForeignMinister Michihiko Kunihiro, if Washington starts ``a sort ofprosecution.''</TEXT></DOC>
