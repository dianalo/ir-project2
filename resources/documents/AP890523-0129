Baker III, and said he will pursue anindependent Israeli peace plan.   Shamir also told a news conference that Britain and the UnitedStates accept in principle Israel's plan for elections in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   But a British Foreign Office official denied this, saying therewere ``clear differences'' during talks earlier Tuesday betweenShamir and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe. Shamir met Mondaywith Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   Concluding his three-day visit to Britain, the Israeli leaderflatly rejected almost all of Baker's speech delivered Monday inWashington. Shamir insisted his government will not negotiate withthe Palestine Liberation Organization or trade land for peace.   ``I think it was useless,'' he said of Baker's call for Israelto forswear the occupied territories, stop Jewish settlements thereand hold ``serious political dialogue'' with the Palestinians.   ``I don't think that all these issues on which we differ haveanything to do with our proposed peace initiative,'' he said.   The Israeli proposal calls for Palestinians in the occupied landto elect representatives to negotiate temporary self-rule withIsrael, with talks to be held later on the final status of theterritories Israel seized after the 1967 Six-Day War.   Shamir said Mrs. Thatcher ``accepted in principle our peaceinitiative,'' adding, ``I think our peace initiative was acceptedin principle by the U.S. government.''   However, British officials echoed Baker's non-committaldescription of the plan as a useful step forward. Asked if Mrs.Thatcher's government accepted the Israeli proposal, a ForeignOffice official, speaking anonymously, said, ``There are cleardifferences.''   Britain, like most West European countries, supports aninternational peace conference on the Middle East.   Israeli Radio reported Howe pressed Shamir to endorse the ideaof yielding territory for peace, but the Israeli said he and hisentire coalition government reject this.   Shamir acknowledged at the news conference that Howe raised theissue, but said it should not be discussed now because the Israeliinitiative means ``all issues'' can be raised during the finalnegotiations.   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Lielcalled Baker's call for land concessions ``explosive.''   ``We can't say no (to Baker), because if we say no, we won'thave a (Palestinian) negotiating partner,'' said Liel. ``We can'tsay yes because if we say yes, we won't have a government.''   Shamir's current diplomatic offensive follows PalestineLiberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat's stated renunciationof terrorism and acceptance of Israel's right to exist.   ``They say they have renounced terrorism _ it is not true,''said Shamir. ``By sitting down with the PLO ... we would legitimizetheir demand for a Palestinian state and we don't want to give themthis gift.''   In Washington, meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yithak Rabinconcentrated on winning support for Shamir's plans.   He told the pro-Israeli American Israel Public Affairs Committeethat Palestinians would derive substantial benefits from theself-government contemplated by Israel, running all governmentfunctions except foreign affairs, defense, and meeting therequirements of Israelis in the territories.   Rabin said it would be a mistake to focus on major components ofa final solution now because the gap between Israel and the Arabsis too wide.   ``To tackle it now would lead nowhere,'' he said. The goalshould be ``to create hope of co-existence.''</TEXT></DOC>
