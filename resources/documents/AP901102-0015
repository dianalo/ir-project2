(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A traffic reporter and pilot werekilled Thursday when their single-engine plane nosedived andcrashed into the embankment of a busy freeway, authorities said.   The victims were identified as Howard Chrysler, 29, a reporterfor Metro Traffic Control, and Doug Hayden, 30, a pilot withCalifornia Wings, which owned the Grumman aircraft used to givetraffic reports to radio and television stations.   Metro Traffic spokeswoman Monica Zech said Chrysler had beenwith the company for about a year.   ``He was super. He was very energetic about his job. He lovedit,'' Zech said.   Officials at California Wings, based at Montgomery Field in SanDiego, did not immediately return telephone calls to The AssociatedPress.   The plane had been circling over a minor accident on aninterstate and crashed, narrowly missing a child day-care center.   There was no fire and very little gasoline at the scene of thecrash.   ``I heard this whirring like there was no gas. Then I heard abig boom,'' said 20-year-old Monica Ortega, whose home was near thecrash.   Other witnesses said the plane nosedived so that it would notcrash into the stream of traffic on Interstate 5.
