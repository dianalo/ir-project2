The results indicate that Israelis are more dovish than theircurrent leadership. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has repeatedlysaid he will never negotiate with the Palestine LiberationOrganization, and the platform of his Likud bloc rules outrelinquishing the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Likud and Israel's other main political bloc, the center-leftLabor Party, formed a coalition government in December afterelections failed to give either party a clear mandate. Labor iswilling to trade some territory for peace.   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip fromEgypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   A survey by the Israel Institute of Applied Social Researchshowed that 65 percent of 1,192 Israeli Jews questioned were willingto give up at least a small part of the occupied lands.   Of those, 17 percent wanted to return all or most of theterritories, according to the poll, which was published by the dailyJerusalem Post. Thirty-five percent opposed any territorialconcessions, compared to 45 percent two years ago. The survey wasconducted in January and has a margin of error from 3 percent to 5percent.   The poll indicated Israelis resent outside involvement insettling the Arab-Israeli conflict. Asked whether Israel shouldagree if the United States exerts pressure on it to withdraw frommost of the occupied lands, 73 percent said no. The figure hasremained unchanged for the past 11 years, the poll said.   Another poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute in the first weekof February, found that 53 percent of Israeli Jews favor talking tothe PLO under certain conditions.   Of that group, however, 38 percent said the PLO has not yetfulfilled its promises of renouncing terror and recognizing Israeland that talks should only begin when those conditions are met.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said in December that he renounced terrorand recognized Israel, prompting the United States to open adialogue with the organization.   Another 15 percent of those polled by Dahaf said Arafat has livedup to his promises and talks should begin immediately.   Forty-two percent opposed talks with the PLO under any conditions.   A similar survey conducted in December found 54 percent backingtalks with the PLO under certain conditions, and 44 percent rulingout any contacts.   Dahaf questioned 1,209 Israeli Jews. The poll has a margin oferror of 2.5 percent.   Asked whether Arafat was sincere in announcing that he wasinterested in peace with Israel, only 11 percent said yes, while 89percent said no.   In results published earlier by Dahaf, the poll showed that 77percent of the respondents oppose the formation of a Palestinianstate, compared to 23 percent who favor such a state.   The results indicated a slight thaw in Israeli attitudes. Adecade ago, 90 percent of Israeli Jews opposed the formation of aPalestinian state.</TEXT></DOC>
