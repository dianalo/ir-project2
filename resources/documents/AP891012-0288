Northwest, in a statement from Minneapolis, said the order was a``testament to the new ownership's and new management's commitmentto the people of the Northwest and the growth of the company.''   The order was for six Boeing 747-400s, the world's largstpassenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highly fuelefficient twin jet.   In addition to those firm orders, Northwest took options on fouradditional 747-400s and another 40 757-200s.   Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at Boeing CommercialAirplanes, said the show of confidence in Boeing, which has beenhit with a strike by production workers, was appreciated.   ``Boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies haveenjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely withNorthwest's new management to further strengthen those ties,''Longridge said.   The planes, to be delivered from late 1993 through 1998, will bepowered by Pratt andamp; Whitney engines.   Striking Boeing workers, who had heard reports of Northwest'simpending order, said the news bolstered their contention thatBoeing can afford a better wage and benefit offer.   ``It doesn't change anything,'' said Matt Bates of theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.``When you've got an $80 billion backlog ... it just underscoresour position.''   Striking Machinists say five consecutive years of record ordersfor the world's largest aircraft manufacturer should result inemployees getting a bigger chunk of the gains.   The company's order backlog stretches into the late 1990s.Orders before the walkout amounted to 736 jets worth $38.5 billionthis year.   The Northwest order was not the first placed during the strikeby the Machinists, who represent 57,800 Boeing workers.Approximately 43,300 of the workers are in Seattle and its suburbs,another 12,000 or so are in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 are in Portland,Ore., and a few hundred others are at sites in several other states.   Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. of Hong Kong said this week it hasplaced orders for two Boeing 747-400 freighters and secured optionsfor two additional models, in a transaction valued at about $600million.   Last Friday company officials announced an order by EvergreenAirways Corp. of Taiwan for four 747-400s and two extended-range767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worthas much as $1.93 billion.   Four planes have been delivered since the strike began Oct. 4.   No talks had been scheduled, federal mediator Doug Hammond saidWednesday.   Boeing's three-year offer to the Machinists featured wage hikesof 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent ofgross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clauseto virtually match inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime andincreases in some benefits.   Another 28,000 Boeing workers start contract talks on Monday.They are members of the company's second-largest union, the SeattleProfessional Engineering Employees Association. Roughly 95 percentof them work in the Puget Sound area, with the rest in Portland andat Air Force bases and other government installations inCalifornia, Florida and Utah, said Dan Mahoney, general counsel.   Mahoney predicted the talks covering engineers and technicalworkers would have little effect on or be much affected by theMachinists' strike. He said the two unions coordinated strategiesin recent years, but this year the Machinists decided not to.   The contract for engineers and technical workers _ whose workincludes designing, drawing, drafting and testing _ expires Dec. 1,but the earliest they could possibly strike would be sometime inJanuary, Mahoney said. They have never struck and ``nobody'sinterested in a strike,'' he said.   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said Boeing officials hoped to havea settlement in the Machinists strike by Dec. 1.   The last walkout by the Machinists lasted 45 days in 1977,ending a couple weeks before the association's contract expired,but had little effect on the smaller union's negotiations, Mahoneysaid.   SPEEA engineers want a 14 percent increase in the first sixmonths, 5 percent in the second six months, followed by 4 percentin each subsequent six-month period of a three-year contract.Technical employees want 14 percent the first six months and 2percent every six months thereafter for the rest of the contract.Both want quarterly cost-of-living adjustments and an unspecifiedlump sum bonus.   To go on strike, Mahoney said, his group would first have toreject a contract by a simple majority, then approve a walkout byat least two-thirds, both on mail ballots taking at least two weekseach to conduct.   A walkout would mean design and development work would grind toa halt, and a return to production with the return of theMachinists would be much slower, he said.   Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause,have been crossing the Machinists' picket lines while refusing todo work normally done by the strikers.</TEXT></DOC>
