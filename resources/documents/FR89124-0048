The matter was remanded to the ALJ on October 21,1988 in order that he might answer questions posed by the Remand. The questionsposed and the ALJ's answers to them appear in the attached RecommendedDecision and Order of the ALJ. The questions posed by the Remand soughtto explore certain apparent inconsistencies between certain findings madeby the ALJ and the Record, some inconsistencies apparent within the RecommendedDecision and Order itself, and to solicit legal authority to support certainstatements made by the ALJ in support of his original Recommended Decisionand Order. On December 23, the ALJ submitted a Recommended Decision andOrder identical to that originally filed, adding only the questions posedon Remand and the ALJ's answers to them. Generally speaking, I find theALJ's answers to the questions non-responsive and argumentative. Too often,instead of legal authority or careful analysis, only conclusory statementsare provided. The ALJ's answer to the posed questions have done littleto assist the Under Secretary in making a just, final decision in thismatter. The crucial question I address in this Decision and Order is whether theRespondent committed one violation of the Act and Regulation as the ALJconcludes on page 28 of his Recommended Decision and Order, or multipleseparate violations of the Act and Regulation as the ALJ finds on page27 of his Recommended Decision and Order. For the reasons set out below,I find that there were fifteen separate violations. The ALJ's pique with Departmental Counsel relates to the failure by DepartmentalCounsel to set out in a form acceptable to the ALJ the specific violationscharged. Specifically, the ALJ calls ``an unusual manner of pleading''the following charge: ``The Department alleges that DSE committed twelveviolations each of andSection;andSection; 387.4, 387.5, and 387.6 of the Regulations,for a total of thirty-six violations of the Regulations * * *'' Contraryto the ALJ's opinion, this simple English sentence is not one subject togross misinterpretation. The Department has alleged that each of the sectionscited has been violated twelve times. Twelve plus twelve plus twelve equalsthirty-six. Obviously the allegations are subject to proof with respectto each of the thirty-six counts. The filings by the Department duringthe proceeding, and especially at the close of the proceeding, amply andclearly detail the violations claimed. Whether it is legally proper that one particular shipment constitute multiple(in this case three) violations is another question. However, there canbe no doubt that the Regulations so provide, and that the Department believesthat each shipment in the instant case contained three violations: onefor acting with knowledge (andSection; 787.4); one for misrepresentation(andSection; 787.5); and one for exporting without proper authorization (andSection;787.6). Even though the ALJ goes to lengths in his Recommended Decisionand Order to deal with six separate and distinct transactions, (identifiedas shipments 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 respectively), eventually finding fiveof those to have been made in violation of the Regulations relating toTemporary Exports, he concludes that the five shipments constitute a singleoverall or comprehensive violation. In view of the ALJ's indicated biasregarding the possibility of multiple violations for a single shipment,it is certainly understandable if the ALJ were to argue that with respectto each of the five shipments there was only one violation per shipment.However, it is a <T3>non sequitur</T3> for the ALJ, after finding specifically that therewere five separate, unrelated shipments, to conclude that the five representone transaction. To do so, the ALJ would have had to cite facts connectingthe five shipments together as a series of shipments related to one transaction.There is no such finding in the ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order_indeedthe findings are contrary_and there are no facts in the record to supportsuch a finding. At the very least, I am faced with a Respondent who hascommitted five separate violations of the Act and Regulations as foundby the ALJ, and possibly as many as fifteen violations, again with supportby the findings of the ALJ. It is clear that multiple violations of the Regulations are possible foran individual transaction. Certainly there can be a diversion without authorizationwhich involves neither misrepresentation or acting with specific knowledgethat authorization is required. If a person completely unknowledgeableconcerning the Act and the Regulations carries a controlled product onhis body to a prescribed destination and delivers at that point, he hasneither acted with specific knowledge nor has he misrepresented. However,he has diverted. So too, hypotheticals may be constructed involving othercombinations. The ALJ may not like it, but that is the law. In most instances,the practical effect of the multiple violations is most apparent upon considerationof appropriate penalties. The ALJ would do well to enforce the law andthe regulations as they are written rather than to strain to construe themin such a manner as to achieve what he considers a more reasoned result.His stretch in the instant case is a perfect example of the danger of thistype of approach: It leads to internally inconsistent decisions. Note thatthe ALJ did find that the Respondent acted not as a novice, but with knowledgeof the Regulations (ALJ page 25), and that the exports were not of a temporarynature (ALJ page 25); thus rendering the use by the Respondent of its GTElicense number D90918 on shipping documentations a misrepresentation. Thusthe ALJ's own findings support fifteen violations, not five, and certainlynot one. Notwithstanding this fact, I cannot say for certain that the totalityof circumstances mandates a significantly greater penalty than that imposedby the ALJ. The ALJ has found specifically that the Respondent cooperatedwith the authorities with respect to another investigation, and took thisinto account in setting his recommended penalty. However, a period of greaterthan two months is appropriate for the ultimate denial of export privileges.I find that the appropriate period in this case should be six months. Hence,the ALJ's opinion will be modified to that extent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding</ITAG>1. I find that Respondent committed three violations each with respectto shipments numbered 2, 5, 7, 8, and 12, for a total of fifteen violations.2. With respect to each shipment identified above the Respondent a. Made shipments that were not authorized, in violation of then andSection;387.6 of the Regulations; b. Acted with knowledge that the shipments were in violation of the Regulations,in violation of then andSection; 387.4 of the Regulations; and c. Misrepresented facts on shipping documents, in violation of then andSection;387.5 of the Regulations. 3. The findings are supported by the Record and by the specific findingsof the ALJ. 4. The unsuspended period of denial of export privileges is more properlyset at 180 days rather than 60 days. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>On November 23, 1988, the ALJ entered his Recommended Decision and Orderin the captioned matter. That Decision and Order, a copy of which is attachedhereto and made a part hereof, has been referred to me for final action.In keeping with the Discussion and Findings above, I hereby modify theRecommended Decision and Order of the ALJ as follows: A. The first sentence of paragraph II of the ALJ's Order (ALJ page 40)is hereby modified to read as follows: ``Commencing 180 days from the datethat this Order becomes effective, the denial of export privileges setforth above shall be suspended, in accordance with andSection; 388.16 ofthe Regulations, for the remainder of the two year period set forth inparagraph 1 above and shall be terminated at the end of that period, providedthe Respondent has committed no further violations of the Act, the Regulations,or the final Order entered in this proceeding.'' B. The last sentence of paragraph III of the ALJ's Order (ALJ page 42)is hereby modified to read as follows: ``Such denial of export privilegesshall extend only to those commodities and technical data which are subjectto the Act and Regulations.''This constitutes final agency action in this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Statement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appearance for Respondent: Michael W.

Hurley, Jr., Esq., Attorney-Advisor,Office of Export Enforcement, Room No. 3845, U.S. Department of Commerce,Washington, DC 20230.</ITAG>On August 1, 1986, the then Office of Export Administration, InternationalTrade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce (``the Agency''), issueda charging letter against Respondent Data Systems Engineering, Inc. (``DSE'').This letter was issued under the authority of the Export AdministrationAct (50 U.S.C.A.App. 2412(c)(1) and Part 388 of the Export AdministrationRegulations (codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399) (the ``Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/> The letter asserts that Respondent DSE had violated andSection;andSection;387.4, 387.5, and 387.6 of the Regulations for each of six exports, fourto Greece and two to Switzerland,\2\<NOTE/> of U.S.-origin computer equipment as temporary exports undergeneral license GTE.\3\<NOTE/> The charging document did not clearly lay out the acts whichare claimed to constitute each of the violations charged.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Pursuant to the provisions of section 15 of the ExportAdministration Amendments Act of 1985 (15 U.S.C.A.App. 2414), the positionof Under Secretary for Export Administration was established effectiveOctober 1, 1987. Proceedings are now initiated on behalf of the Bureauof Export Administration within the Department of Commerce. The one yearperiod for the processing of these cases fixed by those amendments appliesto this case. The complexity of this record and the delay caused by theappeal to the U.S. District Court, in combination, constitutes good causefor the delay involved here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ A number of shipments which were the basis for chargedviolations in the original charging letter were listed in an attached Schedule.There are only six shipments remaining in issue. The charges stemming fromsequentially the first, third, fourth, sixth and ninth shipments on thatSchedule were withdrawn. The eleventh shipment was withdrawn at the hearing.The fact that the shipments are not numbered on the schedule adds to theconfusion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ According to the Regulations, a General License designated``GTE'' was established to authorize only temporary exports which met specifieddesignated conditions (15 CFR 371.22).Agency Counsel has stated that the number of violations charged here isnow eighteen, this is not clear from the charging document, nor was itadequately addressed in Agency Counsel's Post-Hearing Brief. It is alsothe subject of critical comment by Respondent's Counsel in his Post HearingReply Brief at pp. 4-5. A serious problem in these proceedings is thatAgency Counsel refuses to adequately lay out to Responsends or this Tribunaljust what the violations are.The charging letter, in one paragraph, asserts ``The Department allegesthat DSE committed 12 violations each of andSection;andSection; 387.4, 387.5and 387.6 of the Regulations, for a total of 36 violations of the Regulations,each of which involves U.S.-origin commodities controlled under section5 of the Act for national security reasons.''Because of the confusion generated by such unusual manner of pleading andpresentation at the hearing, Agency Counsel was informed that ``I wouldalso like to remind you that in the post-hearing briefs submissions, AgencyCounsel, I want you to present each and every violation separately. I wantyou to lay out in clear detail what constituted each and every violation,the separate elements, proposed findings, whatever have you on all of them.I want you to know that as I look at these inadequate charging letters,I see a possibility of two violations'' (Tr. 302-303).I am aware that in administrative proceedings it is not required that therebe a precision of language similar to that utilized in criminal or otherjudicial proceedings. There must, however, be some limit on how generaland non-specific the Agency and its Counsel may be. The Respondent is,of course, entitled to know the nature and number of charges. In addition,this Tribunal must be informed on what is charged. The Tribunal shouldnot be required to ascertain the numbers and contentions through some Rubic'sCube or other puzzle solving approach. I advised Counsel that I saw thepossibility of two violations and asked for clarification. Whether it isbecause of his obstinate nature or because he cannot lay out the totalnumber of charges he contends remain in the charging letter, I know not.However since he has not explained each of the charges which he contendsare laid, I address a single charge since I no longer perceive the basisfor the two which I saw at the time of the hearing.This is not to say that I cannot construct less, more and or differentpossibilities. However that is not my function. I am also not certain thatthey are what the Agency intends to charge. In no case do they add up tothe number which Agency Counsel contends are alleged here.As already ordered, from and after July 1, 1988, charging letters whichdo not separately set forth each alleged violation and the applicable individualsection of the Regulations or law violated will be subject to dismissal.The Agency also asserts that these shipments were intended to satisfy existingsales contracts, that DSE knew that these shipments actually required exportlicenses, did not obtain such licenses, and filed false and/or misleadinginformation with the Agency relating to these shipments. On October 4,1986, Respondent answered the charging letter and requested a hearing pursuantto the Regulations, which subsequently took place on September 17, 1987before the undersigned Administrative Law Judge. The record in this matterclosed on November 30, 1987.The Decision was issued on September 23, 1988. On October 24, 1988, theproceeding was remanded. Nine questions were posed to which responses areprovided.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Issues</ITAG>Agency Counsel attempted to file and serve an amended charging letter onDecember 22, 1986. This Tribunal denied the request to do so because thatdevice, which restarts the proceeding, was simply unnecessary. Chargesmay be dropped without such a filing. The charges, as presented, were alreadystale. The Agency had over four years to investigate them. In the past,Agency Counsel have explained such delays with representations of complicatedinvestigations and late receipt of information respecting the violations.Here that certainly was not the case. The actions were known at the timeof, or shortly after the violations. This is clear from the advice givenby the investigating Agent while the transactions were ongoing. Unfortunatelythis case has become a Serbonian Bog of bureaucratic delay into which eventhis Tribunal has become mired. The Agency may not be permitted to changedirection, obfuscate or delay further the processing of the case.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Respondent's Counsel argued that the six remaining separateexport transactions which underpin Respondent's alleged violations of theRegulations occurred more than five years prior to the administration ofpunitive sanctions against the Respondent, and enforcement should thusbe barred under 28 U.S.C. 2462, citing <T3>United States v. Core Laboratories, Inc.</T3> 759 F.2d 480 (5th Cir.1985) (Resp. Brief at 14), and that is true.<ITAG tagnum="28">Respondent argues that the statute should not be tolled followingthe issuance of the original charging letter due to Agency's disobedienceof the Administrative Law Judge's discovery orders (Resp. Brief at 14,</ITAG><T3>citing</T3> 759 F.2d 480 at 484). I do not find this argument compelling.Under the Agency interpretation, which finds support in the constructionof other Circuit Courts of Appeal Decisions (<T3>U.S. v. Meyer</T3>, 808 F.2d 912 (1st Cir. 1987)) to which I must defer,the statute was tolled from the filing of the charging letter.For over one full year from the time the Agency issued the original chargingletter, Counsel for the Agency and Respondent engaged in discovery. Afternotice to this Tribunal, Respondent initiated an action in the United StatesDistrict Court in an attempt to obtain judicial resolution of the Agency'srefusal to comply with the Discovery Order issued pursuant to the AgencyRegulation which states ``* * * enforcement by a district court of theUnited States may be sought* * *'' (15 CFR 388.9(d)). The matter was remandedto this Tribunal by the District Court without a substantive disposition.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See Data Systems Engineering, Inc. v. Baldrige, et al.,</T3> Misc.No. 87-0017 (D.D.C., April 28, 1987). In denying Respondent DSE's motionto compel discovery, Judge Gesell declared that the District Court hadno jurisdiction over the matter, and further stated that the Regulationspromulgated pursuant to the Export Administration Act authorized the AdministrativeLaw Judge to issue discovery orders and take ``reasonable and appropriate''action for failure to comply with such orders 15 CFR 388.9(d) (1986). Thecourt also stated that it was barred by 50 U.S.C.A.App. 2412(c)(1) fromjudicial review of this matter, limiting its review power to enforcingadministrative subpoenas of Agency, 50 U.S.C. 2411(a), in discovery disputes,unless perhaps important procedural rights of the Respondent were affected.The 1988 revision to the Act providing for judicial review may alter thisholding (Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub.L.No. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107).<ITAG tagnum="28">The agency regulation (15 CFR 388.9(d)) appears to provide some substantialopportunity for discovery. In practice this has been rather one-sided,for unlike other bureaus in the Department, Counsel for BXA as here, refuseto permit respondent, or even in camera, access to the statements, reportsand the like of expected or noticed witnesses. Nor is the result here anexception or aberration. Agency Counsel who prepared the regulations, 50FR 53130, citing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as the model, isthe same Senior Attorney who appeared on behalf of the Agency here.</ITAG>In consequence of Agency Counsel's refusal to comply with the AdministrativeLaw Judge's discovery order, and after the ruling of the District Court,this Tribunal issued an Order on June 15, 1987, citing the above regulation,directing that, as to any information that Agency Counsel refused to discloseto opposing Counsel, this Tribunal would ``take particular facts * * *as being established'' at the hearing. This Order was issued in order toenforce this Tribunal's previous orders to cooperate in the discovery process.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Agency was on notice that such action would be takenafter the Pre-hearing Conference of December 9, 1986, the decision of theDistrict Court and Order of this Tribunal of December 18, 1986, all ofwhich indicated that the Administrative Law Judge should and would useavailable sanctions for Agency Counsel's failure to comply with the discoveryorder. See also Respondent's Post Hearing Reply Brief at 16-17, which Iadopt.The Agency has objected to the consequences of that order, asserting that``serious procedural error'' was committed by not allowing the Agency topresent the testimony of a Special Investigative Agent for the limitedpurpose of rebutting testimony of one of Respondent's witnesses. This isa blatant misstatement, ignoring the facts surrounding the ruling.Agency Counsel was fully aware, as early as December 12, 1987, that theRespondent intended to present DSE's president as a witness. Agency Counselcannot come to the hearing nine months later, and expect to present a witnessto rebut this testimony without giving opposing Counsel notice of suchan intent. To allow such action would be to give Agency Counsel an unfairadvantage of surprise due to the relative availability of such investigativeagents to Agency Counsel, particularly in light of the unavailability ofsuch witnesses to Respondent's Counsel in the discovery process. Such advantageis unjustified, since it was Agency Counsel's failure to comply with previousdiscovery orders which led to the sanctioning order. He cannot now complainthat the testimony of the Agent should have been permitted at the hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Facts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>Between August 13, 1981 and October 3, 1982 Respondent is alleged to haveexported four shipments of controlled U.S.-origin computer equipment toGreece and two shipments of U.S.-origin computer equipment to Switzerlandas temporary exports under general license GTE when the shipments wereasserted to be permanent exports requiring validated licenses.In connection with each of the shipments, Respondent filed Shipper's Lettersof Instruction (SLI) or Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) representingthat computer equipment could be exported under General License GTE.The four shipments to Greece were made in response to orders placed byAlan Simmons who at the time was Respondent's sales agent in Greece. Respondentterminated that relationship in February, 1982, at the suggestion of anAgency Special Agent investigating Simmons.<ITAG tagnum="85">The Particular Shipments</ITAG>Shipment No. 2 \7\DSE <NOTE/>Invoice No. 275 (Agency Exh. 4B), Air Waybill dated August13, 1981 (Agency Exh. 4A), reflects the export of U.S.-origin computerequipment to Greece. According to the schedule on the invoice, ``Buyermust provide DSE, Inc. with a valid Import certificate covering the abovegoods within 90 days.'' The price of the goods is listed as $5,300.00,with a bank draft submitted for this amount (Agency Exh. 4C), dated August12, 1981, one day before the date of shipment shown on the Air Waybill.Further evidence indicated that DSE's bank notified DSE just one week laterthat collection had been requested (Agency Exh. 4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The shipments are numbered in accordance with the sequencein which they appeared in the Agency's charging letter. The missing numbersof the original eleven were dropped.DSE's ``Shipper's Letter of Instructions'' (``SLI'') \8\<NOTE/> (Agency Exh. 4D), which accompanied this shipment at thetime of export, shows the full amount as $5,300.00 and notes in the ``SpecialInstructions'' block that the shipment is ``CAD'', meaning ``cash againstdocuments'', and asks the freight forwarding agent to notify DSE of theAir Waybill number, flight number and estimated time of arrival.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A Shipper's Letter of Instruction is a multiple-copy documentformatted and used by the freight forwarder as a Shipper's Export Declaration.ShipmentNo. 5DSE Invoice No. 331 (Agency Exh. 7B), Air Waybill dated September 24, 1981(Agency Exh. 7A), to Greece reflects a full purchase price of $111,450.00at the time of shipment, and that payment was requested within 30 days(``Net 30''). DSE received payment less than one month later, the invoicehaving been stamped ``PAID'' on October 23, 1981. The record also includesa DSE credit memo to Digital Resources, LTD, dated December 7, 1981, providinga price adjustment in the amount of $6,996.00 (Agency Exh. 7).\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Digital Resources, Ltd. was a company operated by AlanSimmons. The company and Mr. Simmons were found to have violated andSection;andSection;387.2, 387.4, 387.5 and 387.6 of the Regulations. They were and are subjectto an export denial order. However this listing was subsequent to all ofthese transactions.

Again, the invoice reflects that payment was sought within30 days. The invoice is further stamped ``PAID,'' with a line drawn throughthe word. The president of DSE testified that payment was not received.There was no evidence refuting the fact that the shipments requested payment.The invoice also states ``Demo_two weeks'' and was annotated as shippedas demonstration items to Switzerland (Tr. 214-215). Respondent ExhibitA is the manufacturer's (DATARAM Corporation) invoice which states thatthe equipment was being sent to DSE for a ``30 day evaluation''. A telexwas presented from DSE stating that the unit in question was being sentto Switzerland under GTE License as a ``demo unit'' (Resp. Exh. B). A messagefrom DSE to the consignee asking for return of the demo unit was also presented(Resp. Exh. C). Further evidence indicates that the items were returnedto the manufacturer (Resp. Exh.

The Respondent presentedtestimony from one of it's employees concerning the details of the returnof these items (Tr. 290-291).Shipment No. 12DSE Invoice No. 443 (Agency Exh. 14A), Air Waybill dated October 3, 1982(Agency Exh. 14), and invoices for several pieces of equipment, DSE InvoiceNos. 440, 441, and 432, (Agency Exh. 14J, 14M, 14P) which were not includedin the August 1, 1981 charging letter.\12\<NOTE/> Respondent's SED for this shipment (Agency Exh. 14D) andother related invoices for this shipment indicated that U.S.-origin commoditiesvalued at $23,079.00 were being shipped to Switzerland. The evidence alsoreflects that DSE requested payment within 30 days and in fact receivedpayment three weeks later on October 26, 1982. Invoice No. 443 is stamped``PAID'' but the date is illegible (Agency Exh. 14A). On September 16,1982, DSE applied for a validated license (Agency Exh. 14E) for the equipmentexported on October 3, 1982 under general licenses GTE ( Agency Exh. 14A,14D). A letter from Respondent to the Agency, dated September 16, 1982,requested expedited action on its permanent license application (AgencyExh. 14R) due to the fact the president of DSE needed to take this equipment(Agency Exh. 14A, 14J) with him for installation at that time, which he,in fact, did prior to obtaining the required validated license. The fourinvoices introduced were also stamped ``Goods for demonstration. ImportCertificate required for purchase.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The Agency was not allowed to add these exports as separatecharges to its case. All of these were included in one shipment made onor about October 3, 1982, as indicated in the Shipper's Export Declaration(Agency Exh. 14D).

The Agency alleges that RespondentDSE improperly used general license GTE to export these six shipments ofU.S.-origin computer equipment because Respondent DSE intended these shipmentsto be sales and knew that this equipment was not being exported temporarily,a prerequisite for using this general license. It is argued that Respondent,knowing this, intentionally made false and misleading statements to theAgency and other Governmental bureaus.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ For each of the shipments under review in this proceeding,the commodities were controlled for national security reasons under CommodityControl List (CCL) entry 1565A and required validated licenses for exportto Greece and Switzerland, except where certain general licensing provisionswould be applicable (Tr. 98-103). Except for the shipment No. 12, it wasstipulated by the parties that validated licenses were required for theU.S.-origin computer equipment during the period when shipments were made(Tr. 100).Respondent DSE argues that the exports in question were not intended assales, but were all properly shipped as temporary exports under generallicense GTE for testing and evaluation purposes. Respondent contends thatthe Agency's case must fail because it did not show that Respondent didnot intend its exports of computer equipment to be temporary at the timeof export under provisions of GTE license authority. Respondent contendsthat they acted appropriately and that Agency's own witness stated thatthe Regulations call for, and recognize the need to change a temporarylicensing status to provide for permanent export when one was not originallycontemplated (Tr. 61-62).First Four ShipmentsRespondent does not dispute that following customer testing and acceptance,some of the equipment shipped required a change in license status to providefor validated licenses (Resp. Brief at 2-3). Respondent claims, however,that an investigative field agent for the Department of Commerce directedthe Respondent not to submit necessary changes to license status concerningthe first four shipments. The Respondent contends that this agent, theninvestigating Alan Simmons, directed DSE not to submit necessary changesto license status because of sensitive national security considerations.That assertion is accepted as true. However, I do not find that there wascredible evidence offered by the Respondent at the hearing further indicatingwhen any of the final sales of these shipments occurred, other than relyingon the original shipment documents which indicate that final sales werecontemplated at the time of shipment. The president's testimony ratherreflects his misunderstanding of what constitutes a temporary export.As to Shipment No. 2, the president of DSE, testified under oath regardingRespondent's conversations with the consignee, and his agent in Greece,Alan Simmons of Amber Company (Tr. 180-190). The president claims thatthe annotations made on the export documentation (e.g. ``PAID'') pertainedto invoice costs, not the costs of the commodities \15\<NOTE/> (Tr. 184). Respondent stands by the documentation annotationswhich indicate that there is a need for additional documentation in theevent of final export (Tr. 188).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Respondent attempts to make much of the fact that theshipment, then valued at $5,300 would now be worth under $5,000 and thusnot require a validated export license for a permanent shipment. This isirrelevant to the acts charged here, which constituted a violation at thetime it was committed.There is nothing on the record indicating that a separate decision wasto be made by the ultimate consignee or notification made to the Respondent,that this shipment was to be purchased by the consignee (Tr. 189). Finally,Respondent claims that DSE never applied for a validated export licenseon this shipment because the Investigative Agent told him to discontinuedealing with Simmons due to national security reasons (Tr. 189; Resp. Briefat 8). Though this assertion is accepted, it does not alter the conclusionthat the facts reflect a sales transaction from the outset.As to Shipment No. 5, the Respondent stands by the marking on the DSE invoiceindicating that the commodities shipped were done so for demonstrationpurposes (Tr. 192-194; Agency Exh. 7B). The company president testifiedthat the agent in Greece, had to advance Respondent's cost for the demonstrationequipment before it could be shipped to Greece because the Respondent couldnot afford to obtain it from the manufacturer before that time (Tr. 195-196).The circumstances do not support a conclusion other than that this wasin fact a sale financed by the buyer.According to DSE's president, Shipment No. 7, was also for test and demonstrationpurposes, thus Respondent contends that these items were for temporaryexport (Tr. 199; Resp. Brief at 10). The witness contended that the languageon Invoice 307, ``The above goods sent and invoiced * * *'' did not reallymean that commodities were sent and payment demanded, but instead wereused simply to satisfy a Greek customs formality (Tr. 255-256).Shipment No. 8 is also claimed to have been for demonstration purposesonly (Tr. 200-201). The president of DSE testified that the cost-relatedinvoice information annotations on the shipment documents demonstratedthat he relied on the GTE temporary license (Tr. 202-203). Again, the witnesstestified that the investigative agent informed Respondent DSE that itwas to terminate all contacts with Simmons because of national securityreasons, and DSE complied fully (Tr. 203, 207-208).The Respondent's arguments for each of the annotations on the differentdocumentation are simply not convincing when considered in the contextof the transactions. It appears, from a preponderance of the evidence,that the Respondent did in fact violate the regulations as charged withrespect to these shipments because the transactions were in fact meantto be sales with some right of return.The Respondent claims that Shipment No. 10 was returned to the U.S. vendorafter testing overseas, and thus it was an entirely appropriate GTE-licensedtransaction not requiring validated export license. Respondent's argumentsconcerning this shipment are convincing. This shipment involved goods thatwere claimed to be for temporary purposes and subsequently returned tothe United States. The documentation and evidence presented indicate thatthe parties intentions were to demonstrate the equipment. This was properlydocumented. The evidence does not support a conclusion that they were alreadysold. I conclude that the equipment was properly exported under the temporarylicense.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ While the Respondent further claims that the Agencypurposely overlooked this evidence. The record does not support that assertion.I see it as a disagreement respecting the interpretation of the acts.The last shipment in question, Shipment No. 12, was covered by an exportlicense subsequently approved and validated by the Department. Respondentargues that this was appropriate because it was covered by an approvedAgency validated export license upon being accepted by the customer afterdemonstration and testing.The Respondent's president testified that the shipping documentation statedthat the item covered by Invoice 443, was exported <T3>for demo purposes </T3>(Tr. 232-233). Further, Respondent claims thatValidated Export License Nos. 64087 and 64088 subsequently covered anypermanent export of the item listed in Invoice 443. The Respondent claimsthat the demo model was approved for purchase later by the consignee, thereforehe properly obtained the validated export license for permanent exportof this equipment (and other related equipment shipped along with it).The evidence indicates that, as to this computer eqipment, a validatedexport license was asked for and yet the equipment was sent under a GTElicense. Thus, Respondent knew what the intentions was and chose to misrepresentit in order to expedite his shipment (Tr. 233-234).\1\\7\<NOTE/> The mere fact that the shipment would have been valid ifmade under the appropriate Export License does not excuse Respondent'sconduct in circumventing the law. Nor would the shipment have been properunder GLV as is now argued for it was Respondent who elected to make oneshipment under a number of invoices which in combination were not ``deminimus'' in value. This shipment made under Invoice No. 443, was improper.The fact that Respondent attempted in the course of the transaction toacquire the proper license, indicates that the Respondent knew that theactions were violations. Further, this shipment was made after the Respondentwas aware of the investigations into some of its previous transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Testimony was given to the effect that this order wasfor demonstration purposes, in that if there was a defect in the product,it could be returned.<ITAG tagnum="28">It was clear from the testimony of Respondent's president that thisshipment was for final sale. As with most final sales, a defect in theproduct allows the buyer to return it within a reasonable time. This generalconsideration in commercial transactions is insufficient to classify thetransaction as ``temporary for demonstration purposes'' under andSection;371.22 of the Regulations, which clearly does </ITAG><T3>not</T3> cover exports ``* * * with the intent to change the registration,sell, or otherwise dispose of the commodity abroad'' 15 CFR 371.22(c)(3).The Agency also contends generally that the export control documents, includingSLIs and SEDs, prepared by the Respondent contain false representations,due to the fact that DSE knew that these exports were intended to be shippedto complete sales. Respondent provided its general license number as GTED90918 for the first four questioned shipments, Shipments Nos. 2, 5, 7,and 8. The fifth and sixth shipments, Shipments Nos. 10 and 12 listed generallicense number GTE D90918 on the SEDs. By listing these license numbers,the Agency contends that DSE falsely represented that these shipments wereeligible for export under these temporary licenses, knowing that theseshipments were ineligible for such treatment were as part of sales transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>The evidence indicates that a permanent exports were in fact made for ShipmentsNos. 2, 5, 7, 8 and 12, although Respondent's witness testified to thecontrary. The totality of the circumstances and evidence produced on behalfof the Respondent does not rebut the documents presented by the Agencywhich support the conclusion that sales were intended and made. there hasnot been credible evidence produced that any of the equipment shipped inthe above numbered exports was intended to be returned.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ As Agency counsel points out in his Reply Brief, evidencethat contemporaneously and objectively attests to DSE's export activitiesis entitled to greater weight than subjective explanations by an interestedparty. Respondent ignores the documentary evidence introduced by the Agencyshowing that it received payment for three shipments and a portion of afourth shipment out of the six shipments in question. (Agency Reply Briefat 2-3). With respect to Shipment No. 12, I find that the sale was finalprior to shipment.The record reflects that DSE was not a novice respecting the use of generallicense GTE and/or validated licenses. DSE had reason to know what andSection;371.22 of the regulations required, since it applied for registration asan exporter of commodities for temporary use abroad under the provisionsof Section 371.22 of the Regulations on September 5, 1979, certifying thatit ``underst[oo]d and will comply fully with the provisions of GeneralLicense GTE.'' Respondent even received a warning letter from the Departmentin May of 1980 in connection with its voluntary disclosure of the salein Switzerland of two disc controllers exported under general license GTE. The evidence is clear and uncontested that the export of the commoditiesinvolved required validated licenses.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The real and singular issue is whether the exports were ``temporary''_Iconclude that they were not. A mere right of refusal or to cancel and returnis not sufficient grounds for labelling the export as temporary. The recordhere reflects all the common aspects of a sale including delivery. Thatthere may have been some ability to negate the sale does not qualify tomake the transfer temporary. With respect to Shipment No. 10, the evidenceshows an export for demonstration. The details support the contention thatthis was a true demonstration activity and no violation is found incidentto that export.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Respondent did not concur or stipulate to the needfor a validated license with respect to Shipment No. 12, as with the othershipments. However, the attempt to question that determination was notconvincing. No showing was made respecting why the items involved was nota properly controlled commodity as was his burden since the question respectingwhether matters are properly on the list is a matter for determinationin a separate process.  Though I find that Respondent ``knowingly'' exported the five items improperly,I do not find that the violation was deliberate or willful. Rather thekind of knowledge and or intent found (and that which applies generallyin these cases), is that described by the Supreme Court in <T3>United States v. International Minerals and Chemicals Corp., </T3>402U.S. 558 (1971). It was held there that even where the requirement wasthat the individual ``knowingly'' violated the statute, the quality ofthe knowledge involved related to a knowledge of the facts, not the law,and reiterated the general rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse.<T3>See also United States v.

Respondent Data Systems Engineering (DSE) is a United States corporationand person within the meaning of the Export Administration Act, as amended,and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 50 U.S.C.A.App. 2412(c)(1),15 CFR Part 300.2. Between August 1, 1981, and October 3, 1982, Respondent exported, onfive occasions, (the charged Shipment Nos. 2, 5, 7, 8 and 12) Shipmentsof U.S.-origin equipment to Greece and Switzerland as temporary exportsunder GTE licenses.3. The five exports were to fulfill existing sales contracts requiringvalidated licenses at the time of shipment.4. The existence of a right to reject or return equipment with or withouttrial or test by the purchaser does not constitute a ``temporary'' export.A sale on approval or with a right to refuse and return does not constitutea ``temporary'' export. Shipment for test, evaluation, demonstration andthe like incident to or in contemplation of a sale is not a ``temporary''export.5. The five exports were not temporary exports within the meaning of theregulations particularly 15 CFR 371.22. The five shipments were not madeprincipally for demonstration, test or evaluation.6. The use of GTE licenses for such shipments under the circumstances wasimproper.7. Respondent exported the five shipments which it had reason to know requireda validated export license in violation of the regulations.8. The evidence presented does not establish that the export of ShipmentNo. 10 under the GTE License was improper. That aspect of the charge isDISMISSED with prejudice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>I conclude that a violation of the Export Administration regulation andSection;371.22 and incident thereto, of andSection;andSection; 387.4, 387.5 and 387.6occurred. The failure of the Agency to spell out with some clarity whatacts constitute which violations leads me to find a single overall or comprehensiveviolation. Contrary to Agency Counsel's assertions, his Post Hearing submissionwas not responsive to my request. I share Respondent's Counsel's assertionof a lack of clarity and disclaim the representation that it is ``self-inflicted''.Upon examination of the charging letter and the evidence it appears thatthere may well be multiple violations inherent in the alleged misconductrecited, however it is for Agency Counsel to clearly state what they arerather than for this Tribunal to decipher equivocal and confusing messages.It is also probable that the approach attempted is substantially multipliciousand the sanction would be the same regardless of the tally.I conclude that this company in what appears to have been an attempt toavoid the delays which bedeviled routine export licenses, some years agoimproperly used its GTE Temporary License to promptly fill its purchaseorders, fully intending to follow up with a validated license in due course.That was not permissible.I specifically disapprove of a civil penalty in this case because the costsborne by this company in business, legal expenses, reputation and personalapprehension has substantially exceeded what would otherwise be appropriateby way of civil penalty here.\20\<NOTE/> It is also the basis for the substantial suspension of thedenial period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The lack of standards for civil penalties in these casesdespite the specific authorization in section 11(c)(4) of the 1985 Amendments,the Administrative Conference reports and adopted recommendations as wellas the example of other agencies, even within this Department, complicatesuch impositions.In arriving at the penalty set forth in the Order that follows I have givenparticular credit to the cooperation Respondent and its president gavein the larger Simmons investigation, Respondent understanding of the credithe would receive for such participation; the unconscionable and unexplainabledelay in initiating and completing these proceedings, the Respondent'sprecarious small business status and the lack of willful intent. Nevertheless,some sanction is appropriate for the GTE license process was abused. Hadthe proper validated licenses been timely sought the identification andsanction of Mr. Simmons might have been made sooner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Remand Questions and Responses</ITAG>1. If the charging letter was ``inadequate'' (Recommended Decision andOrder, page 3), why were the charges not dismissed?Ans. Not every inadequacy warrants dismissal. The deficiencies in the styleand content are fully discussed in the Decision.2. In light of the Department's post-hearing brief, pages 4 through 18,how is it not clear that the Department was charging three separate violationsof the regulations for each of six shipments? Please refer to the specificlanguage of the Department's post-hearing brief which fails to make thismethod of alternative pleading clear.Ans. The charging document which initiates the proceeding is where theseparate and sufficient allegations must be stated. In the charging letterof August 1, 1986, the Respondent is alleged to have committed thirty sixviolations which are not sufficiently set forth. In the course of the proceedingssome of the alleged violations were withdrawn. The problem in understandingjust which alleged violations were dropped and the effect on what mightbe termed the cross violations was most confusing. This cross-referencingto sections of the regulations omits allegations as to the particular violativeactions. The absence of specific separate charging language renders theprocess confusing and uncertain. The direction at the conclusion of thehearing to Agency Counsel to the effect that: ``* * * I want you to presenteach and every violation separately. I want you to lay out in clear detailwhat constituted each and every violation, the separate elements, proposedfindings, whatever have you on all of them'', was clear, unequivocal andproper. The post-hearing submissions on behalf of the Bureau did not confirmto that reasonable request. The decision clearly reflects the facts found.The Agency did not lay out each charge separately in the charging documents,as it should have done. Nor did its counsel do so even when offered theopportunity to do so after the hearing, which in retrospect constitutedan inappropriate deference to the Agency. The only alternative reasonablyavailable was to announce findings of facts consistent with the allegationsand the evidence of record. It is for the Agency to articulate each separatecharge, if it chooses to lump multiple acts in a single charge that isone of its options. It is not proper or appropriate for this Tribunal toparse the record and select which violations may be separately found. Becausethe Administrative Law Judge's decision appears to lay out what maybe consideredas multiple violations it is not appropriate to conclude that the chargingletter was sufficient to support any particular number of violations morethan one. It must stand by itself. As issued, it fails to separately andinsufficiently set forth the sixteen or so violations now claimed. 3. On page 26 and 27 of the Recommended Decision and Order, five specificshipments are found to have violated Export Administration Regulations.In view of this fact, how can the conclusion be drawn that there was one,``single overall or comprehensive violation'' of the Regulations? Specifically,were the five sales separate and distinct transactions, or were they allpart of one transaction which would support, possibly, the conclusion reachedon page 28? Ans. There were construed to have been so charged by virtue of the failureof the Agency to: specifically identify each charge at the outset; identifythe proof relative to each separate charge in the evidentiary presentationand to therefore provide the requested identification and correlation foreach of the remaining charges. The decision respecting whether to consolidateor separate charges is to be made at the time the proceeding is initiated,the generalized approach utilized in this case has led to ``garbage can''records from which findings and conclusions are extracted without the connectionbetween pleadings and proof that is necessary for proper initial adjudicationand subsequent review. The conclusion on page 28 is reiterated and reaffirmed.If the Agency wishes to charge multiple separate violations they must beso stated in the charging document so that this Tribunal, the Respondentand appellate reviewers, administrative and judicial, may track the pleadingsand proof. 4. Of what relevance is the following statement on page 28 of the RecommendedDecision and Order: ``I conclude that this company in what appears to havebeen an attempt to avoid the delays which be bedeviled routine export licenses,some years ago improperly used its GTE temporary license to promptly fillits purchase orders, fully intending to follow-up with a validated licensein due course.''? Specifically, did the ALJ take into consideration anyfacts which suggest ``delays which be bedeviled routine export licenses''in making his Recommended Decision and Order? Ans. It is my recollection that in the initial meetings with Mr. Beasleyand Mr. Reed before Mr. Hurley intervened, there was some such allusion.It was also referenced and common knowledge that there had been lengthlydelays in the licensing process during the relevant period. Another contributingcircumstrance was, that part of the license appeal process had been transferredto this office without adjudication responsibility in 1986. The ``leavethem swinging in the breeze'' attitude apparent in the handling of thosecases which was even more dilatory than that previously observed as theHearing Commissioner and Appeals advisor over a decade ago. It furtherreflected the Agency attitude and practice on license processing matters,the observation was considered relevant because it reflected a probablemotivation, albeit an inappropriate one, for the Respondent's conduct andwas consistent with the known practice of the Agency. 5. Assuming,<T3> arguendo,</T3> that there were five specific and separate violationsof the Export Administration Act, would the ALJ's recommended penaltieshave been greater than those found in the Recommended Decision and Order?Ans. No. (<T3> see infra</T3> p. 26), where it is stated ``It is also probable thatthe approach attempted is substantially multipicious and the sanctionswould be the same regardless of the tally.''6. The ALJ has characterized the Department's action as one of ``unconscionableand unexplainable delay in initiating and completing these proceedings.''(Page 29) What specific rules, statutes or orders were violated by theDepartment in its handling of this case? Please be specific and indicatethe amount of time that each act added to the conduct of the case. Didthe Department ever act outside its legal rights? Ans. The quote is plural.No score or time card is maintained on the problems with delays, AgencyCounsel appeared to initially complicate and drag out these relativelysimple proceedings. The records in this and other proceedings speak forthemselves. The congressional imposition of the one-year period for adjudicationmanifests the attitude and action of that legislative body. ``Justice delayedis Justice denied'' is not a trite remark, in these international activitiesthe frequent three to five year unexplained delays in initiating proceedingsseriously inhibit the ability to develop a complete and accurate record.Not charging this Respondent at the same time as Alan Simmons, who wascharged nearly four years prior to the issuance of this charging letter,shows the Agency's lack of diligence, when it is apparent that the evidenceused relating to the Respondent's transactions with Mr. Simmons were availableat that time. The Agency acted outside its ``legal'' rights in refusingto comply with the discovery order and in contending that multiple violationswere charged when the pleadings did not sufficiently identify each of theseparate allegations and Counsel obdurately refused to describe them asdirected.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Senate Comm. on Governmental Affairs, Study on FederalRegulation, Volume Four, Delay in the Regulatory Process, S.Doc. No. 72,95th Cong., 1st Sess. (IX) (1977) (``Ribicoff Report, Volume Four'').7. Of what legal relevance in setting penalties is the fact that the businessinvolved is a small business or the fact that it has borne legal expensesand other subjective costs in defending its extra legal activity? Ans.As the late Justice Benjamin Cardozo put it, it is the duty of Judges ``toweigh the effect of the default and adjust the rigor of the remedy to thegravity of the wrong.'' All of the circumstances surrounding the incidentare for consideration including the nature and size of the business, thefull range of costs incurred, and other adverse social consquences. Thefailure of the Bureau to establish standards for determining appropriatepenalties as it's predecessor Administration indicated it would do almosta decade ago (Agency Assessment and Mitigation of Civil Penalties, 1 CFR305.79-3) constitutes a substantial defeat in the process (79 Colum. L.Rev. 1435 (1979)).8. Since the Recommended Decision and Order finds five separate violationswith knowledge, how can it be said that there was no willful intent toviolate the Export Administration Regulations?Ans. A single consolidated charge was found to have been made, nevertheless,the premise, either as posed or as more accurately stated, bears littlerelevance to the ``willful intent'' questions. Willful violations are cognizableunder sec. 11(b) of the statute and are criminally actionable. Whetherthere were one or one hundred separate acts may, has little relevance towhether they were willful. The test to be applied in these cases is discussedin the full paragraph on Page 26 and again at page 29 of the decision,as well as in a number of other cases. The bare assertion, in a post hearingsubmission by Agency Counsel, constitutes neither a legal or factual basisfor such a finding. 9. What legal authority exists for excluding or disallowing the proposedtestimony of a witness to be called for the limited and specific purposeof impeaching a prior witness' statement with respect to a particular matterof fact?Ans. The drawing of inferences and the exclusion of witnesses are but twoof the routine types of sanctions invoked for failure to comply with discoveryorders. The sanctions imposed here were reasonable and appropriate underthe circumstances (<T3>see infra</T3> pp. 7-8). The situation which developed in this casewas foreseeable and foreseen.Section 788.9 of the Regulations (15 CFR 788.9) provides for discovery.The history of that provision over the past fifteen or so years is documentedin Agency records. A decision was consciously made in about 1977 to rejectthe hardline approach of denying discovery in favor of the approach containedin the above cited rule which suggests that the Federal Rules of CivilProcedures shall apply subject to a consistency test. Rule 37 is particularlypertinent to the situation presented here. The cases cited in note 61-Sanctionsand 39-Order of Preclusion in Title 28 of the United States Code Annotated,Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are particularly pertinent. The subjectof discovery is also treated in an Administrative Conference Recommendation(Discovery in Agency Adjudication, 1 CFR 305.70-4) as well as in numerousother Civil and Administrative Law texts.
