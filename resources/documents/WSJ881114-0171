At 892 pages, it is the size of a city telephone book. The information is highly technical and the print is small. The price is a wallet-emptying 11,000 yen, or about $85.    The report offers a guided tour of the Japanese science establishment's vision of the future. It outlines Japan's technology strategy, year-by-year, between 1987 and 2015. It is a consensus document, prepared by Japanese experts and submitted to the Science and Technology Agency.    The findings were developed using the so-called &quot;delphi&quot; method. Experts from academia, government and industry met numerous times in committees and subcommittees. They made their best guesses about future directions in technology. Their judgments were tabulated and weighted for importance, then designated as technology &quot;targets.&quot;    From a corporate Randamp;D point of view, this &quot;target&quot; means an ideal research and development target date. So once something is decided on this level of survey, &quot;it gets down to corporate Randamp;D levels as a very probable, or targetable date,&quot; says Noboru Makino, chairman of Mitsubishi Research Institute, a private think tank. Mr. Makino chaired the committee that produced the report.    This is the fourth survey of this kind, the first having been done in 1971. By and large, Mr. Makino says, the predictions have been highly accurate. A professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology reviewed the past data and said that in electronics, the previous surveys had been more than 70% accurate.    Here is a sampling of results from the latest study.    ---                  The Futures as Seen by Japan   Japan's long-range technology goals and when it expects to achieve them.   1994 Use Computer Aided Design to make computer chips with more than one million gates. -   1996 Develop protocol technology to easily link communication networks.   1997 Remove sludge from the sea floor and purify fishing sites.   --Employ underwater robots at depths of 300 meters.   1992 Use artificial intelligence in aircraft management and control.   -- Develop a control system to prevent aircraft collision.   -- Employ local disaster forecasting and prevention systems.   -- Develop technologies to remove chemical pollutants from the atmosphere.   -- Employ nursing robots to help elderly and handicapped people.   2000 Reduce noise and vibration around train tracks.   -- Store electronic information safe from natural calamity or human error.   2001 Develop artificial organs that the body won't reject.   2002 Prevent the spread of cancer in the human body.   -- Write bug-free large-scale software in short order.   -- Employ space robots with high-level artificial intelligence to perform difficult operations   2003 Employ an international digital communications network world-wide.   -- Develop high-performance materials to lower the cost of space travel.   -- Produce semiconductors and medicines on commercial basis in factories in space.   2005 Correct the abnormal division of cancer cells and return them to normal cells.   2011 Develop superconducting materials for use in industrial electrical machinery at near room temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
