A considerable decrease in the glycogen content was provedin the interval of 1 to 1.5 h following irradiation. The same methodwas used in the observation of changes in the glycogen content in experimentaldogs after whole-body irradiation with 6 Gy. The changes in the glycogencontent were evaluated 2, 4 and 8 days after irradiation. A decreasein the glycogen content was again shown, however, less pronounced ascompared with that in the experimental rats. (author). 4 figs., 2 tabs.,14 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
