Junk.    For most of 1989, stocks have risen on a tide of takeovers -- both actual and rumored. These takeovers have been financed by high-yield, or junk, bonds. And even though the junk-bond market has been weakening for several months, the stock market has soared ever higher.    But now many investors are saying, in effect, that the stock market can't have it both ways. They argue that if junk-bond prices fall -- and in recent days they have fallen fast -- a great many stocks will follow.    &quot;You have this dichotomy between the junk-bond market and the value of equities, and it can't persist,&quot; says Kyle Krueger, senior vice president of Eagle Asset Management.    &quot;A lot of what has driven the stock market is takeovers. Inasmuch as that music stops because it's harder to do financings, it makes us cautious, at best, on equities.&quot; Mr. Krueger has raised the cash portion of his $3 billion portfolio to 25%, the highest level since the 1987 crash.    &quot;As the junk market weakens, values will come down not only on actual takeovers but also on stocks that are subject to rumors,&quot; adds Wolfgang Armbruster, a special-situation analyst at PaineWebber. &quot;The effect on stocks could be enormous, depending on where the junk market settles.&quot;    Although junk-bond prices have been weak for months, they got a jolt this week when cash problems deepened at Campeau Corp.'s retail empire, a house that was built, leveraged brick by leveraged brick, with junk bonds. At times this week, bidding has just about dried up for some of the weaker junk bonds.    The gap by which the interest rates on a Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette junk-bond index exceeded those on seven-year Treasury bonds has widened to 6.1 percentage points, its highest ever. This so-called spread is a measure of the perceived risk of owning junk.    In the past two days, as the depth of Campeau's problems have become apparent, takeover stocks have taken a pounding. &quot;We're in a minipanic,&quot; one takeover speculator says. Yesterday alone, UAL lost 2 3/4 to finish at 280 1/2 and American Medical International was down 1 to 23 3/8. Stocks flying on merely the talk of takeovers fared no better; Goodrich fell 2 to 55 3/4, McGraw-Hill was down 1 1/2 to 73 1/2, and AMR slipped 4 1/8 to 77 5/8.    Since the start of 1986, junk bonds have financed $59.9 billion of takeovers, according to Securities Data Co., based in Newark, N.J. (These bonds also have financed billions of dollars in corporate recapitalizations.)    If that pace slows down, analysts say, Wall Street could return to its traditional method of valuing stocks according to earnings. Recently, &quot;valuations have tended to gravitate away from earnings to so-called private-market values,&quot; Mr. Krueger notes. But he says that trend is changing.    Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer who specializes in leveraged buy-out candidates, agrees. &quot;The day of the great acquisition motivated by financial considerations is over,&quot; he says. &quot;It will be replaced by strategic acquisitions.&quot;    In other words, corporations will replace &quot;LBO types&quot; as buyers, and they will tend to pay lower prices. Buyers, he says, will have to rely on their own credit. The game of promising to pay off debt by selling assets to someone else -- Campeau's failed strategy -- may be winding down.    &quot;Asset values become suspect,&quot; says Robert Raiff, co-head of research at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. &quot;You can own a $1 million house and still go bankrupt owing $10,000. &quot;If you can't liquefy assets, it raises questions about what the value is. You can be asset-rich and cash-poor.&quot;    Shares of Hilton Hotels, one rumored target, could lose 25% of their value without the prospect of a takeover, Mr. Krueger says.    One measure of the &quot;takeover premium&quot; built into stocks is that companies acquired this year have generally been sold at 30% to 50% more than stock prices prevailing a month before a bid was announced, according to IDD Information Services.    Not everyone agrees that stocks are headed for trouble. &quot;I think the junk-bond market is but a fraction of the stock market. What's important {to stocks} is the direction of the economy,&quot; says Michael Steinhardt, a New York investment manager.    Raymond Minella, co-head of Merrill Lynch's merchant-banking department, which includes its high-yield, junk-bond division, says the thesis that stocks will sneeze when junk catches cold &quot;makes sense in itself. However, P-E multiples as opposed to late '87 are a lot lower. So it would seem that there is more margin for error.&quot;    Also, Mr. Minella says, the Mandamp;A business isn't going away. But, he adds, deals will be more conservatively capitalized.    James Caywood, a principal in Caywood Christian Capital Management, a junk-bond investor and manager, says buyers are likely to demand that junk issuers put in &quot;more of their own dough&quot; and reject funny-money junk of the zero-coupon, non-cash variety. Stocks will still be bought out -- but perhaps not as frequently, and probably at lower prices.    Some investors expect that higher-quality junk issues will rebound. Mr. Raiff says &quot;the greatest opportunity in the market today is distressed bonds.&quot;    Michael Price, president of Mutual Shares Corp., says &quot;there's no way stocks will stay where they are with the whole junk market dropping. Something has to give.&quot; But although he believes stocks are vulnerable to a fall, some junk bonds could be poised to go the other way. &quot;Some of these bonds have moved down incredibly,&quot; he says. &quot;We're starting to become buyers.&quot;    However, even if junk bonds make a partial recovery, buy-out artists may have trouble funding fresh deals. In just about any industry, investors can buy old bonds at fractions of their original price. &quot;You have to wonder, why would anyone finance a new deal at par when there are hundreds of deals which are trading at a discount?&quot; a takeover speculator says.    Also, investment bankers may be less eager to advance temporary &quot;bridge loans&quot; if a later refinancing from junk isn't a sure thing. First Boston, for instance, is stuck with an investment in Ohio Mattress -- whose junk bonds were spurned by investors -- and in the Federated department-store unit of struggling Campeau.    &quot;In the short term, it's likely that investment bankers will re-examine their commitments to do bridge loans,&quot; PaineWebber's Mr. Armbruster says. Buy-outs financed by banks -- such as the one proposed for UAL -- should fare better than junk-financed deals. But he says the general caution is likely to spill over to bank-financed deals as well. </TEXT></DOC>
