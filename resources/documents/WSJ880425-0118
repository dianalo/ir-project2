Mr. Jackson, the underdog in tomorrow's Pennsylvania primary, seems at times to be not so much combating Gov. Dukakis as lobbying him. He pushes for commitments to liberal programs -- and detailed plans to pay for them.    &quot;The dreams will not become real unless you identify the money,&quot; he said in a Pittsburgh-area debate Saturday night. &quot;Our talk, our words, will not become flesh.&quot;    Polls in Pennsylvania show the Massachusetts governor with a strong lead in the popular vote, and he is likely to do even better in winning the state's delegates. The Rev. Jackson will face uphill battles in two more industrial state contests next week in Ohio and Indiana.    But the questions he presses on Mr. Dukakis foreshadow three months of preconvention maneuvering that will help determine the Democratic ticket and the platform it runs on.    Mr. Jackson, better known for generating passion than green-eyeshade budget analyses, nevertheless has put on the table a striking budget package. He'd raise the top individual income-tax rate to 38% from the current 33%, return corporate taxes to roughly Jimmy Carter levels, and freeze defense spending for five years.    The preacher and civil rights leader went after Mr. Dukakis yesterday, attacking him for failing to give specifics on budget questions. But the governor, who was chugging through an old-fashioned whistle-stop tour, rejected his rival's demands. &quot;You can't prepare a budget now for next year,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;That's absurd.&quot;    In an earlier news conference, Mr. Dukakis had more gently deflected Mr. Jackson's pleas for budget commitments. &quot;I made that mistake once, in 1974,&quot; he said, referring to a pledge not to raise taxes in Massachusetts. Going back on the promise helped defeat him in 1978.    Nor would Mr. Dukakis climb down from his broad, thematic campaign. &quot;I'm not here to announce a big plan,&quot; he told listeners at a struggling Philadelphia-area port. &quot;I'm here to announce that I care very deeply.&quot;    The two men had spent much of the weekend in a celebration of civility. Mr. Dukakis joshed his rival on live television Friday at a Philadelphia debate and got a playful elbow in the ribs in return.    But even before Mr. Jackson himself went on the offensive yesterday, his aides had been giving the governor something sharper than a friendly nudge. Frank Watkins, Mr. Jackson's national political director, complained last week that Mr. Dukakis has offered only &quot;minor league budgets&quot; and is too cautious &quot;to walk through a yellow-light district.&quot; And Robert Borosage, a Jackson issues adviser, charged that there is a gap between what Mr. Dukakis promises to provide and what kind of budget he says it will take: &quot;He's talking Jesse but spending Bush.&quot;    Campaigning in this state has at times produced a curious kind of role reversal. Mr. Jackson has been out-Dukakising his managerial rival on budget details; the controlled Massachusetts governor has visibly loosened up in the afterglow of his New York victory.    But both do revert to form at times. Mr. Dukakis seemed less pleased than nonplused when a Greek freighter's crew enthusiastically interrupted his early-morning talk at the Philadelphia-area port by playing Greek music over the ship's loudspeaker. And the chronically disorganized Mr. Jackson showed up five minutes late for Friday's debate, groping through the blue television curtains just as the introductions ended.    &quot;I was on time,&quot; he later insisted. &quot;When the first question was asked, that was time enough.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
