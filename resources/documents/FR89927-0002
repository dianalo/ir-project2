Hertzberg, ActingAssociate Administrator for Finance and Investment, Small Business Administration,1441 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20416, telephone (202) 653-6574.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On May 1, 1989, SBA published a noticeof proposed rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 18529) to implement the 1988 legislation.No comments were received so the proposed rule is adopted as the finalregulation. For almost ten years, SBA has administratively operated a CertifiedLenders Program (CLP) for selected participating lenders. Approximately670 participating lenders are Certified Lenders presently. Certified Lendersare subject to all the rules and regulations applicable to participatinglenders generally. The basic distinction between regular processing andCLP processing is that the SBA is committed to review and respond to CLPapplications in three business days. CLP lenders may use regular processingwhen necessary. The branch and district offices are directed to focus theirattention immediately on CLP applications while regular applications, evenfrom CLP lenders, are processed by SBA in the order they are received bysuch offices.Section 102 of Public Law 100-590 (102 Stat. 2989) authorizes the SBA toestablish the CLP in a more formal posture. Accordingly, the SBA is publishingthis final rule to implement the 1988 legislation.The final regulation is placed in a new Subpart E to follow the presentsubpart which covers the Preferred Lenders Program (PLP). Section 120.500sets forth Congressional intent to establish a CLP in which lenders maysubmit applications to SBA for guaranty and the SBA reviews such applicationswith a contemplated three business day turnaround.Section 120.501 contains definitions of terms and words to be used in theCLP regulations. Section 120.502 explains the procedure by which a participatinglender becomes a Certified Lender. An SBA branch, district or regionaloffice may initiate the process, but two approvals are required for thenomination to be effective. Thus, the SBA regional administrator must agreewith the SBA district director before the latter could execute an agreementwith the participating lender. If the regional administrator and the districtdirector disagree, they must send their recommendations to SBA CentralOffice for final decision by the Associate Administrator for Finance andInvestment. This procedure ensures that the nomination would get a fulland complete review.Section 120.502-2 presents the factors which SBA considers in evaluatinga recommendation that a participating lender be a Certified Lender. Theseinclude whether the lender has a proven ability to serve the credit needsof the small business community; whether the lender has a history of submittingto SBA complete, accurate and adequately analyzed loan guaranty applicationpackages; whether the lender has shown the ability to work with the localSBA office and whether it has the ability to process, close, service orliquidate SBA loans; whether the lender has an SBA purchase rate that isacceptable to the local and regional SBA offices; whether the lender isprepared to commit at least 40 percent of its loan guaranty applicationsthrough CLP procedures; whether the lender has well-trained, qualifiedofficers who are well-versed in SBA's lending policies. These criteriaare general in order to allow SBA to take into account the wide varietyof economic conditions and banking systems throughout the United States.The thrust of CLP is to rely on the expertise of the Certified Lender'sloan officers so that SBA can make informed reviews within a three-dayperiod. That is why a lender must demonstrate its expertise before SBAcan designate it as a Certified Lender. Section 120.503 states that allthe general provisions in part 120 relating to the operations of participatinglenders continue to apply to Certified Lenders. The main distinction betweenparticipating lenders as a group and Certified Lenders is that SBA willmake a good faith attempt to review a CLP application within three businessdays. However, SBA's failure to meet this time frame has no effect on whetheror not the CLP loan will be approved.The 1988 legislation provides that SBA has the authority to suspend orrevoke the designation of a lender as a Certified Lender if SBA determinesthat the lender is not adhering to SBA rules and regulations or that thelender's purchase rate is excessive to other lenders. SBA believes thatthis authority already exists in present andSection; 120.305 of its regulations(13 CFR 120.305) which is incorporated into this subpart by andSection; 120.500(b).For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), SBA certifiesthat this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because the program is operational presently andthis final regulation does not change the existing program. Similarly,SBA certifies that this final rule does not constitute a major rule forthe purposes of Executive Order 12291, since its promulgation is not likelyto result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.This final rule would impose no additional reporting or recordkeeping requirementssubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.This final rule will not have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 120</ITAG>Loan programs/Business.Pursuant to the authority contained in section 5(b)(6) of the Small BusinessAct [15 U.S.C. 634(b)(6)] and section 136 of Public Law 100-590 (102 Stat.2989), SBA hereby amends Part 120, Chapter I, Title 13, Code of FederalRegulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 120_BUSINESS LOAN POLICY</ITAG>1.
