So say the bankers who pawed over the guest list at a recent New York banquet of the Institute of International Bankers. They wanted to see which regional companies were dining at the tables set aside for Marine Midland Bank and its parent, Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking, whose chairman, William Purves, spoke at the dinner.    Among those rubbing shoulders with the Scots from Hongkong andamp; Shanghai were officials of Shawmut National Bank and Citizens First National Bank of Glenrock, N.J. Officials of those two banks dismiss takeover speculation, saying they attended the dinner because their banks have correspondent relationships with Marine and Hongkong.    In New York, a Marine Midland spokesman notes that there still are some restrictions on bank takeovers across state lines. He says of the two banks, &quot;It's purely a product relationship. We'd drool at the prospect (of buying them), but I don't think they'd want it; they're strong, independent banks.&quot;    Foreigners have regretted some U.S. acquisitions of years past, such as Midland Bank PLC's loss-plagued takeover of Crocker National, which began in 1981 and ended in 1986, when Midland cut Crocker loose. &quot;The track record with larger companies wasn't satisfying, so they're now looking for clean regional acquisitions&quot; with little or no Third World debt, said James J. McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods.    Of course, the foreigners' ardor could be undermined by any sharp upturn in the dollar or further gains in interest rates. But at the moment the weak dollar makes U.S. acquisitions look relatively inexpensive. The lackluster stock market also helps.    Fifteen regional banks tracked by Prudential-Bache's analyst George Salem now trade at an average of 137% of book value, compared with more than two times book value before the October market crash. Recent increases in interest rates have deterred many U.S. investors from buying bank stocks, Mr. Salem said.    But the foreigners say they are eager to diversify their earnings by buying American. They favor different areas of the U.S. market. European banks, led by the British, increasingly concentrate their searches and purchases in the Northeast. Japanese investors look more to the West Coast, an area the British have deserted in recent years. And there's speculation that Canadian banks are looking hard at Detroit-area banks.    So far, regional banks have attracted most of the foreign attention. But Banca Commerciale Italiana's $707.6 million friendly bid for a 51% stake in Irving Bank could spark interest in U.S. money-center banks, whose stock prices have been battered by Third World debt worries. Such speculation has already buoyed the shares of the weaker New York money-center banks such as Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover, causing them to out-perform their financially stronger peers in the past few weeks.    Leery of such attentions, several big New York banks recently installed anti-takeover measures. Investment bankers who advise foreign acquirers say the money-center banks' big Third World debt holdings probably are sufficient to deter most foreign buyers.    On the regional front, other countries are following Britain into the northeastern U.S. Bank of Ireland recently agreed to acquire First NH Banks for $370 million, and there's talk of West German banks possibly buying into the region. Meanwhile, Japan's Bank of Tokyo in February agreed to acquire Los Angeles-based Union Bank from Standard Chartered of London for $750 million.    Britain's National Westminster Bank has said it wants to build a large northeastern U.S. regional bank on the base of its New York unit. After its recent acquisition of First Jersey National, analysts expect its next moves to come in nearby states such as Massachusetts and Connecticut. Because of earlier consolidation among New England commercial banks, thrift institutions in many cases would be less expensive than commercial banks and preferable acquisition targets, analysts say.    Among the larger New England concerns -- each with assets of more than $1 billion -- are First Constitution Financial, Society for Savings Bancorp and Gateway Bank in Connecticut, as well as Boston Bancorp., Boston Five Cent Savings Bank, Comfed Bancorp, Heritage NIS Bank Savings, Home Owners Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, and Neworld Bancorp. in Massachussets, according to analyst Henry Peltz at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods.    These larger thrifts now typically trade at around 80% of book value, Mr. Peltz said, with their stock prices restrained by higher interest rates.    Hongkong andamp; Shanghai, through its stalking horse Marine Midland Bank, already has agreed to acquire First Pennsylvania Bank in 1992. It has investments -- which some believe could turn into full acquisitions when regulations allow -- in New Jersey's Statewide Bancorp. and Society Corp. of Ohio, and has &quot;loans and a close relationship with Michigan National Bank,&quot; Marine Midland says.    Royal Bank of Scotland, which recently agreed -- subject to regulatory approval -- to acquire Citizens Financial Group Inc. of Rhode Island for $440 million, says it expects to expedite and possibly expand the Rhode Island bank's regional expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
