CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GAF CI AET XRX TAFINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><TEXT>   GAF Corp. said it settled a longstanding legal battle with five insurance carriers over coverage for asbestos-related health claims against the company.    GAF, which formerly made asbestos products, had sued five of its insurers in California state court in San Francisco in 1979, claiming that they were obligated to defend and indemnify the company in all present and future asbestos cases filed against GAF.    GAF didn't put a dollar value on the settlements. But it said the settlements will provide GAF &quot;with substantial insurance coverage designed to satisfy pending and prospective asbestos claims and related expenses.&quot; Wayne, N.J.-based GAF is a co-defendant in about 25,000 pending lawsuits involving health claims relating to inhalation of the toxic asbestos fiber.    GAF, a maker of specialty chemicals and building materials, no longer sells asbestos products. Before 1970, asbestos was commonly used to insulate buildings against fire and other hazards.    The settlements involve Insurance Co. of North America, a unit of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp.; Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Hartford, Conn.; certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London; First State Insurance Co., Wilmington, Del.; and North River Insurance Co., a unit of Crum andamp; Forster Inc., itself a unit of Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn. GAF said it would pursue smaller claims it has pending in California courts against certain other insurance carriers.    GAF said it entered into a separate agreement with Transamerica Insurance Co., San Francisco, a unit of Transamerica Corp., which had previously agreed to pay the full cost of GAF's defense against certain asbestos-related claims.    Samuel J. Heyman, GAF chairman and chief executive officer, said the settlements would relieve GAF of an &quot;ongoing and burdensome legal expense.&quot;    In connection with the settlements, GAF said it is joining the Wellington Asbestos Claims Facility, an organization of more than 50 former asbestos producers and insurance companies formed in June 1985 to administer asbestos claims. By banding together, members of the private, non-profit facility say they can cut litigation costs and avoid lengthy trials while compensating asbestos victims.    Most of the nation's former asbestos producers already have joined the facility. But GAF, apparently seeking to gain leverage in its suits against the five major insurers, had previously declined to join. If GAF hadn't joined, the insurers might have faced stiffer legal and administrative expenses if they had to pay to defend GAF against individual court suits. The insurance carriers with which GAF settled are all members of the facility.    Besides presenting a huge potential financial burden for GAF, the company's legal problems with asbestos-related health claims have hindered it from proceeding with certain plans.    In 1983, when GAF was in the throes of defending itself against a proxy fight led by Mr. Heyman, the company's former management tried to sell GAF's chemicals business to Allied Corp., the predecessor to Allied-Signal Inc. But Allied later balked at the acquisition because it was concerned about inheriting any liability for GAF's asbestos problems.    GAF shares closed yesterday at $40.50, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
