Paint version 2.1 on our HP 9000/345 workstation.andO;The program IslandIn-stall produced a welcome banner on the screen and a menucontaining installation options.andP;  Note: IslandInstall isn't available forusers of net licensing.andM;We used the Quick Install option.andP;  You can use this option if you plan toinstall Write, Draw andamp; Paint for a single user, on only one machine, and atthe default location (/usr).andM;ON YOUR WAY TOandM;IMPRESSIVE DOCUMENTSandM;To start one of the applications, a window displays the work area where youcreate your documents and images.andP;  At the top of the window is a menu barwith pull-down menus that include options: File, Edit, View, Options,Arrange, Text and Doc.andP;  (Help is available, and each option is detailed inthe User's Manual.andP;  A mouse moves the pointer around to select items withinthe pull-down menus and to shape and resize the window as needed.andM;If you're familiar with the OSF/Motif windowing structure and use of themouse, you'll immediately be ahead of the game.andP;  Otherwise, the user manualhas a complete, easy-to-read chapter titled &quot;Using OSF/Motif.&quot;andM;When starting IslandWrite, you can simultaneously open an IslandWritedocument.andP;  Specify a document and it appears as the current page.andP;  If youdon't specify a document, the current page will be blank.andM;A Tool Palette appears in a separate rectangular box next to the work area.andO;In IslandWrite, the work area is referred to as the page, IslandDraw's workarea is the tablet and in IslandPaint it's called the canvas.andM;Your choice from the Tool Palette determines the action you can perform onthe current page.andP;  For example, to enter and manipulate text, choose the Texttool.andP;  To select and manipulate containers, choose the Selection tool.andP;  Acontainer is an object that can contain text or graphics.andP;  Containers can berectangles, polygons or columns.andP;  Text is the default mode on the ToolPalette.andM;The insertion point is where text appears when you type, paste or importtext.andP;  When you start a new IslandWrite document, the insertion point appearsat the beginning of the column on page one.andP;  IslandWrite uses automaticwordwrap.andM;PICTURES SET TO WORDSandM;Starting Draw and Paint is similar to starting Write in that you cansimultaneously open a Draw or Paint document.andM;With Island Draw, you can create overhead presentations, charts, forms,illustrations or diagrams.andP;  In addition, you can import graphics, such as EPSfiles, AutoCAD plots or charts from Lotus 1-2-3.andM;Draw's Tool Palette is equipped with an assortment of drawing tools thatenable you to draw Bezier and freehand curves, lines, regular and irregularpolygons, regular and rounded rectangles, ellipses and arcs.andM;You can change the line style and weight.andP;  By clicking on the Flip Verticallyor Flip Horizontally icon, you can turn your drawing upside down or rotate itby 90-degree increments.andP;  There's also a Free Rotate icon that lets yourotate your objects to any orientation.andM;With IslandPaint, you can create original art or touch-up scanned images.andO;You also can import scanned raster images, bitmaps, screen shots or clip-art.andM;Paint's Tool Palette contains many of the same tools available in Draw.andP;  Asits name implies, Paint includes a Brush tool to use for painting.andP;  A BrushPalette is included to let you choose new brushes and access the BrushEditor.andM;The Brush Editor is for modifying the shape of a brush.andP;  The edit areadisplays a magnification of the pixels that compose the brush's shape.andO;Change the colors of the pixels to black or white using the tools in theEditor dialog box, and the brush takes on a shape of your own design.andP;  Theability to change your brush shape on a pixel basis can result in creatingvirtually any type of brush style you desire.andM;The pattern Palette provides choices for new patterns to use and leads you tothe Pattern Editor.andP;  All painting tools except the pencil use patterns forlines or fills.andM;With Write, we created several documents and added our own drawings andpaintings created with Draw and Paint.andP;  Although the series includes thethree separate applications, we found all three to be similar in operation.andO;Learning the application Write enabled us to quickly learn Draw and Paint.andM;The User Manual devotes a part to each of the three applications.andP;  Each parthas a table of contents followed by a complete description of the applicationand an extensive tutorial for creating your own documents or designs.andM;If you're looking for a complete desktop publishing package for yourworkstation, the $995 IslandWrite, Draw andamp;
