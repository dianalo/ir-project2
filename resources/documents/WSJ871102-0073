The company said it wrote down by 324.8 million Canadian dollars its investment in 67%-owned Westar Mining Ltd., which operates coal mines in southeastern British Columbia.    British Columbia Resources, which also has holdings in forest products, said the write-down, to a &quot;nominal value,&quot; is a result of adverse coal markets and the failure so far to restructure about 350 million dollars of Westar Mining's bank debt. British Columbia Resources added that it has stopped consolidating Westar's results.    The outlook for Westar remains dependent on a recovery in metallurgical coal prices and volumes and the conclusion of a reasonable restructuring of the bank debt, British Columbia Resources said. Discussions with Westar Mining's bankers are proceeding &quot;slowly,&quot; it added.    For the third quarter, British Columbia Resources said it had operating profit of 5.5 million Canadian dollars, or four cents a share, up 77% from restated year-earlier results of 3.1 million dollars, or one cent a share.    One-time charges of 329.7 million dollars in the latest quarter, mainly from the Westar Mining write-down, made the net loss 324.2 million dollars, widened from a year-earlier net loss of 159 million dollars after charges of 162.1 million dollars, mainly involving asset write-downs.    Third-quarter sales fell 23% to 71.3 million dollars from 92.8 million dollars.    For the first nine months, operating profit was 10.2 million dollars, or six cents a share, up 24% from 8.2 million dollars, or three cents a share, a year earlier. After 326.8 million dollars of one-time charges, mainly from the Westar Mining writedown, the net loss for the latest period was 316.6 million dollars, widened from a year-earlier net loss of 164.2 million dollars after charges of 172.4 million dollars, mainly from write-downs.    Sales for the nine months fell 42% to 205.1 million dollars from 354.2 million dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
