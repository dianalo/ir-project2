(the) resignation was the way it wound up,&quot; Mr. Kaminsky said. He said he didn't think Ms. Evans had been hired to take over his job, but he added, &quot;I don't know.&quot;    Mr. Kaminsky, 45 years old, had been at Random House for three years. He previously was chief executive officer and publisher of Warner Books, a unit of Warner Communications Inc.    Ms. Evans was named publisher and editor of the Random House adult trade book operation, its flagship book publishing imprint. She also will be responsible for the Villard Books imprint.    Robert L. Bernstein, president and chairman of Random House, which is part of the S.I. Newhouse publishing empire, will be in charge of three other imprints, Times Books, Vintage Books and Fodor Books.    Robert L. Bernstein, president and chairman of Random House, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc., will be in charge of three other imprints, Times Books, Vintage Books and Fodor Books.    Ms. Evans joined Random House in early September, leaving her job as president of the trade division of Simon andamp; Schuster, a unit of Gulf andamp; Western Inc. At the time of the move, Random House said she would be president of a new, unnamed publishing imprint.    In an interview, Ms. Evans said she has no idea what precipitated Mr. Kaminsky's resignation as executive vice president. She said she had no reason to believe Mr. Bernstein had considered replacing Mr. Kaminsky all along.    Ms. Evans said she got her first inkling of the change while on vacation in Rome last week and phoned the office. Mr. Bernstein declined to tell her over the phone about the impending change and her new role, so she quickly took a flight back to New York. Arriving in the evening, she called Mr. Bernstein, who insisted they meet that night. &quot;He wanted me to think about . . . (taking the new job) as soon as I could,&quot; she said.    One Random House executive, who asked not to be named, said that Mr. Kaminsky had been eager to succeed Mr. Bernstein and that &quot;Bob is certainly not ready to step aside.&quot; The executive also said that Ms. Evans hadn't been hired with the intention of replacing Mr. Kaminsky and that the dispute came up &quot;suddenly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
