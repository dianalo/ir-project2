(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nearly 500 anti-nuclear protesters, manywith their children in tow, scaled fences around the Seabrooknuclear power plant Saturday, and police waiting inside arrestedthem.   Protesters brought ladders to help them over the 8-foot fencesthat surround the plant. Once inside the plant, the demonstratorssat down.   At the busiest of the six points where protesters climbed thefence, at least 300 people went over _ including two confined towheelchairs, many children and at least one infant in abackpack-carrier.   Officials estimated 600 to 700 activists took part in the rally.Police Chief Paul Cronin said 475 people were arrested, including469 charged with criminal trespass and six with disorderly conduct.Cronin said the six were accused of jumping in front of busescarrying protesters to the police station.   Among the protesters were David Hills, 35, who brought his6-year-old daughter, Dana.   ``The point of children coming along is (that) so many peoplewant to hide their children from what's going on in the world,'' hesaid.   Asked why she came to the demonstration, Dana said, ``Because Ididn't like Seabrook.'' Asked why, she said, ``because people candie.''   At a rally earlier, Molly Yard, president of the NationalOrganization for Women, drew cheers.   ``For the first time, the National Organization for Womennationally is standing with a group working to end nuclear power inthis country,'' she said.   ``Today, we petition the powers that be: `Heed the voice of thepeople of this country. No nuclear power.'''   After Yard spoke, protesters marched to the $6.2 billion plantto post photographs of children on its fence. The theme for theprotest, and others scheduled this week, is ``For Our Children'sFuture,'' and many demonstrators brought their children with them.   Other events set for the coming week include a rally at theStatehouse on Sunday and concluding with a demonstration atPresident Bush's home in Kennebunkport next weekend.   Saturday's rallies were sponsored by a group called theClamshell Alliance, a name that came from the group's concern thatSeabrook's cooling system might accidentally discharge into thesurrounding ocean and harm shellfish on the New Hampshire coast.   Protests began at Seabrook in 1976, when a lone demonstratorclimbed a weather observation tower. Later that year, 18 peoplewere arrested as they tried occupy the muddy construction site.Since then, in mostly peaceful demonstrations, more than 3,200arrests have been made.   In 1979 and 1980, a splinter group impatient with thenon-violent civil disobedience practiced by the Clamshell Allianceducked behind plywood shields and attacked the plant fences withbolt cutters, grappling hooks and ladders. Police and NationalGuardsmen used riot sticks, tear gas, Mace, fire hoses and dogs torepel the attacks.   Since then, authorities have allowed demonstrators to climbfences before arresting them.   The plant's foes oppose nuclear power as dangerous andexpensive, and argue that Seabrook is not safe and that thecongested beach tourist area around it could not be evacuatedsafely in case of an accident in the summer.   Plant officials say Seabrook's double-shelled reactor dome makesit the safest plant around and argue that even if there were anaccident, emergency plans for communities within 10 miles of theplant are adequate to protect people.   Seabrook's first reactor was completed in 1986 after its secondreactor was canceled and mothballed while 25 percent finished. Itcompleted low-power testing in June, despite a valve problem thatcut the test short. The response of plant operators to themalfunction was criticized in state and federal reviews.   Now 10 times over budget and 10 years behind schedule, the plantremains idle as challenges to its evacuation planning hold upfull-power licensing.</TEXT></DOC>
