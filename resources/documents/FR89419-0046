Thepurpose of designating National Marine Sanctuaries is to protect and managedistinctive areas of the marine environment for those conservation, recreational,ecological, historical, research, educational, or esthetic values whichgive these areas special national significance. The Act is administeredby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); throughthe Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM); Marine andEstuarine Management Division (MEMD). In January 1982, NOAA published a Program Development Plan (PDP) for theNational Marine Sanctuary Program, describing the Program's mission andgoals; site identification and selection criteria; and the nomination anddesignation process. In September 1982, NOAA issued proposed regulationsfor the continued operation of the Program (47 FR 39191). Pursuant to thePDP and those regulations, NOAA published a proposed Site Evaluation List(SEL), comprised of highly-qualified marine sites identified and recommendedto NOAA by regional resource evaluation teams. SEL sites meet Program criteriafor further evaluation as possible National Marine Sanctuaries. Team recommendationswere made in accordance with the Program's mission and goals set forthin the PDP, in Section 922.1 of the final Program regulations, and in Appendix1 of the regulations. The Stellwagen Bank study area was recommended bythe Resource Evaluation Team for the North Atlantic Region, and was placedon the SEL in 1983 (48 FR 35568). In the normal process of National MarineSanctuary designation, the Secretary of Commerce (through NOAA) will fromtime to time select sites from the SEL as Active Candidates, to initiatethe process of such further evaluation. Changes in the process for designating National Marine Sanctuaries weremade by 1984 and 1988 Amendments to the Act (Title III of Pub. L. 98-498,and Title II of Pub. L. 100-627, codified at 16 U.S.C. 1431 <T3>et seq</T3>). NOAA's program operating final regulations (15 CFR Part922, 53 FR 43802, October 28, 1988), reflect the provisions of the 1984Amendments. Where there is a conflict between the current regulations andthe 1988 Amendments, NOAA relies on the statutory Amendments. The 1988 Amendments (section 304(b)) establish a finite period of timefor designation of new National Marine Sanctuaries, i.e., 30 months fromthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of Active Candidacy to a notice of designation(or findings regarding why such notice has not been published). Additionally,the 1988 Amendments specifically require (at section 304(a)) that a prospectuson the Stellwagen Bank proposal be submitted to Congress not later thanSeptember 30, 1990. NOAA is announcing Stellwagen Bank as an Active Candidatenow in order to meet the required deadline for this submission to Congress.The Active Candidacy notice formally initiates the 30-month period duringwhich NOAA must conduct the complete National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA) environmental impact analysis process, and publish either a noticeof designation or findings regarding why such notice has not been published.Following the scoping meetings announced in this notice, subsequent designationsteps include preparation of the DEIS/MP document; public hearing(s); preparationof a final environmental impact statement/management plan; and recommendationfor approval of the designation to the Secretary of Commerce or designee.Opportunities for public comment exist throughout this process, and willbe announced in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> the local media, and other appropriate channels.Section 303 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433) and implementing regulations forthe National Marine Sanctuary Program (at 15 CFR 922.33) establish proceduresfor evaluation of the suitability of active candidates as National MarineSanctuaries. NOAA will determine to what extent designation will fulfillthe purposes and policies of the Act, i.e., whether: (1) The area is of special national significance due to its resource orhuman use value;(2) Existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate to ensure coordinatedand comprehensive conservation and management of the area, including resourceprotection, scientific research, and public education;(3) Designation of the area as a National Marine Sanctuary will ensurecoordinated and comprehensive conservation and management of the area notprovided by existing authorities; and(4) The area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive andcoordinated conservation and management.In making these determinations, NOAA will consider:(1) The area's natural resource and ecological qualities, including itscontribution to biological productivity; maintenance of ecosystem structure,maintenance of ecologically or commercially important or threatened speciesor species assemblages, and the biogeographic representation of the site;(2) The area's historical, cultural, archeological, or paleontologicalsignificance;(3) The present and potential uses of the area that depend on maintenanceof the area's resources, including commercial and recreational fishing,subsistence uses, other commercial and recreational activities, an researchand education;(4) The present and potential activities that may adversely affect thefactors identified in the considerations listed above; (5) The existing State and Federal regulatory and management authoritiesapplicable to the area and the adequacy of those authorities to fulfillthe purposes and policies of the Act;(6) The manageability of the area, including such factors as its size,its ability to be identified as a discrete ecological unit with definableboundaries, its accessibility, and its suitability for monitoring and enforcementactivities,(7) The public benefits to be derived from Sanctuary status, with emphasison the benefits of long-term protection of nationally significant resources,vital habitats, and resources which generate tourism;(8) The negative impacts produced by management restrictions on income-generatingactivities such as living and non-living resource development; (9) The socioeconomic effects of Sanctuary designation; and(10) The fiscal capability of NOAA to manage the area as a National MarineSanctuary.In preparing the DEIS/MP to examine the management, boundary and regulatoryalternatives associated with Sanctuary designation, NOAA will solicit commentsfrom interested individuals, groups and organizations, appropriate CongressionalCommittees, Federal agencies, responsible officials of State and localgovernments, and officials of the affected Regional Fishery ManagementCouncil. This will be done during the scoping meetings identified herein,to be conducted prior to preparation of the DEIS/MP. Comments will alsobe received during public hearings on the completed DEIS/MP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Site Description</ITAG><T3>Natural Resources.</T3> Stellwagen Bank is a shallow, glacially-depositedgravel feature located approximately six miles (10.186 km) off the northernend of Cape Code, Massachusetts, in the southern Gulf of Maine. The Bankmeasures 18.75 miles in length and 6.25 miles in width at its widest point.Water depths over the Bank range from 61 feet along the scarp of the southwesternend, and 78 feet at the northwestern end, to a maximum of 120 feet at thesoutheast end of the Bank. Deeper waters surround the Bank; maximum depthsexceeding 330 feet occur north of the Bank and within the study area. TheSanctuary study area occurs entirely within Federal waters. The study areais marked by the following coordinates: 70anddegrees;14andmin16;N, 42anddegrees;36andmin16;W(northeast point) by 70anddegrees;35andmin16;N, 42anddegrees;31andmin16;W (northwestpoint) by 70anddegrees;26andmin16;N, 42anddegrees;05andmin16;W (southwest point),by 70anddegrees;04andmin16;N, 42anddegrees;09andmin16;W (southeast point). <T3>Oceanographic/Physical Characteristics. </T3>Oceanographic conditionsand hydrography are highly varied in the vicinity of Stellwagen Bank. Surfacecirculation in the Gulf of Maine generally is counterclockwise, with currentsmoving southward along the Maine and New Hampshire coasts and into theMassachusetts Bay, where the flow turns gradually eastward across the northernedge of Georges Bank, further offshore. The moderate to high velocity,east-west tidal current sweeps the Bank's shallows, generating internalwaves during summer months. Mixing of the water column is widespread duringwinter months, when isothermal conditions characterize the Bank's waters.The Bank's profile is markedly asymmetric: the seaward edge is gentle,and the shoreward slope is steep (dropping from 27 to 80 meters over ahorizontal distance of approximately one kilometer).<T3>Regional Productivity.</T3> Primary biological productivity at StellwagenBank follows a temperate coastal zone cycle. Two distinct peak productivityperiods are evident: the more extensive from March through May, and a second,shorter period from mid-September through October. Seasonal overturn andmixing of coastal waters with nutrient-rich waters from deeper strata producea complex system of overlapping mid-water and benthic habitats. Predominantlysand and gravel substrates support benthic communities composed of polychaeteworms, amphipods, and mollusks.The extensive and cyclic biological productivity supports a variety ofcommercially important fishery resources. Over a dozen species are commerciallyharvested, including mackerel, bluefin tuna, blue fish, shad, menhaden,herring, striped bass, cod, haddock, flounder, quahog, and sea scallop.The predominant forage fish found at the Bank is the sand lance (<T3>Ammodytes americanus</T3>), which attracts several large fish speciesand a seasonal variety of balaenopterid cetacean species. The largest high-latitudepopulation of humpback whales (<T3>Megaptera novaengliae</T3>) in the contiguous United States occursseasonally at Stellwagen Bank, in addition to fin whales (<T3>Balaenoptera physalus</T3>), minke whales (<T3>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</T3>), northern right whales (<T3>Eubalaena glacialis</T3>), Atlantic white-sided dolphins (<T3>Lagenorhynchus acutus</T3>), white-beaked dolphins (<T3>Lagenorhynchus albirostris</T3>), and harbor porpoises (<T3>Phocoena phocoena</T3>). In addition to these frequently-observed species,orca whales (<T3>Orcinus orca</T3>), and pilot whales (<T3>Globicephala melaena</T3>) are also occasionally observed at StellwagenBank.Particular scientific interest is focused on four species of large cetaceans(humpbacks, fins, minkes, and northern rights) using Stellwagen Bank asfeeding and nursery grounds. With the exception of the minke whale, thesespecies are all considered ``endangered'' pursuant to the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>).Northern right whales are one of the most severely endangered cetraceanspecies in the world; no more than 150 individuals are thought to remainin the western North Atlantic Ocean. Recorded sightings of right whalesat Stellwagen Bank over the past four years indicate the Bank's importancefor feeding and for nursing of calves: a significant number of identifiednorthern right whales have been observed returning to the Bank season afterseason.Fin whales exist in relatively large numbers throughout the world's non-tropicaloceans, and approximately 3,600 to 6,300 exist in the North Atlantic Ocean.Fin whales associated with the Stellwagen Bank system are ubiquitous andapparently year-round residents.Minke whales also exist in relatively large numbers worldwide (excludingtropical waters), although the size of the North Atlantic population iscurrently unknown.The world population of humpback whales is believed to be not more than8,000 animals geographically distributed into fifteen demographic groups.Approximately 2,000 humpbacks in the western North Atlantic Ocean comprisethe largest, yet least studied, population in the world. More than 100humpbacks return annually to Stellwagen Bank from mating and calving groundsin the eastern central Caribbean Sea. Research to date has focused on thisspecies, and details of its movements are better documented than thoseof other cetaceans. Humpbacks enter the Stellwagen Bank system betweenmid-March and mid-April, and remain until mid-November (one of the longestresidency periods known anywhere).Diverse pelagic and coastal bird species seasonally forage at the StellwagenBank system. Among species known to frequent or migrate through the Bankarea are: storm petrels, gulls, terns, brants, oldsquaws, scoters, ospreys,shearwaters, dovekies, puffins, fulmars, gannets, murres, loons, kittiwakes,phalaropes, and jaegers.At least two species of sea turtles also feed in the general area of theBank, the loggerhead <T3>Carretta carretta</T3>) and the leatherback (<T3>Dermochelys coriacea</T3>). Transient species include the Kemp's ridley(<T3>Lepidochelys kempi</T3>) and the green (<T3>Chelonia mydas</T3>).<T3>Human Uses.</T3> Waters over and around the Bank are used extensivelyfor numerous purposes, including commercial and recreational fishing, commercialwhale-watching, recreational boating, shipping, and research.<T3>Commercial Uses.</T3> The most important activity directly dependenton resources of the Stellwagen Bank area is commercial fishing. Extensivefisheries include groundfish species, such as Atlantic cod, haddock, yellowtailflounder, winter flounder, and silver hake. Invertebrates include oceanquahogs, sea scallops, and American lobsters. Pelagic fisheries includeAtlantic herring, mackerel, bluefin tuna, and bluefish. The New Englandcommercial fishing fleet increased from 1,225 registered vessels in 1986(5 gross tons or larger) to 1,334 such vessels in 1987; and total landingsincreased slightly from 275,300 tons to 277,600 tons during the same period.Revenues generated (adjusted value) exceeded $186 million in 1987.Commercial whale-watching activities operating from Maine to Connecticutare largely focused on Stellwagen Bank and Jeffrey's Ledge (located northof Stellwagen Bank). During 1986, more than 40 commercial whale-watch vesselsconducted trips to these areas from May through September (approximately8,550 trips). Assuming full vessel capacity, visitation levels to theseareas exceeded one million persons during the five-month period. Revenuesin 1986 from commercial whale-watch operations are estimated at over $16million.Shipping lanes for commercial vessel traffic in and out of Boston traversedirectly across Stellwagen Bank. During 1986, a total of 12,728 trips weremade in and out of Boston by both self-propelled and non-self propelledvessels.<T3>Recreational Uses.</T3> Recreational fishing in the Stellwagen Bankarea is seasonal and primarily focused on scup, bluefish, summer and winterflounder, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic cod, and pollack. Recreational boatingis also a popular activity during summer months.<T3>Research Activities.</T3> The biological abundance of the StellwagenBank system generates scientific research on cetaceans and the resourcessupporting them. Research and monitoring activities are also conductedon fisheries. Research facilities in the area include the Center for CoastalStudies (Provincetown); the University of Massachusetts (Boston); the NewEngland Aquarium (Boston); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WoodsHole); the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole); the Manomet BirdObservatory (Manomet); and the National Marine Fisheries Service (Gloucesterand Woods Hole). Additional institutions or organizations having supportedresearch activities in the vicinity of Stellwagen Bank include the Collegeof the Atlantic; Gloucester Fishermen's Museum; University of Maine; Universityof Rhode Island; and Cape Cod Museum of Natural History.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Designation Process</ITAG>The management plan to be prepared for the proposed Sanctuary will specifythe goals and objectives of Sanctuary designation and describe programsfor resource protection, research and interpretation. The various administrativeand regulatory alternatives for Sanctuary management will be analyzed inthe environmental impact statement.Opportunities for public participation in NOAA's development of a draftenvironmental impact statement and management plan will be provided throughthe June scoping meetings, solicitation of comments on the DEIS/MP document,and public hearings.The June scoping meetings will attempt to identify issues in establishinga Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary and generate suggestions forresolving them. Topics for discussion will include the following: (1) Boundaryalternatives; (2) management alternatives; (3) resource protection; (4)interpretive opportunities.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Federal Domestic Assistance Catalogue Number 11.429 Marine SanctuaryProgram)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.
