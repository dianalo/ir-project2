The suit alleged, among other things, that people whobought stock in the funds hadn't received adequateinformation about the funds' prospects.</LP><TEXT>   Since real-estate prices began declining, investors in thefunds have had hundreds of millions of dollars in paperlosses. Each of the funds went public at $10 a share; manyare currently trading at less than a dollar a share; nonetrades over $4. The investor losses are slightly amelioratedbecause of cash distributions the &quot;income-oriented&quot; fundsmade until February 1990.   People who bought the shares -- from the time the variousfunds were initially offered in the mid-1980s through Aug.21, 1990 -- are eligible to participate in the proposedsettlement, although at current prices they stand to recoveronly pennies on the dollar for what they have lost.   Under the proposed settlement, the funds said, they willpay a total of about $24 million. VMS Realty -- the ailingreal estate syndicator and developer from whom the fundssevered their ties in early 1990 after it ran into financialproblems -- agreed to pay $7.5 million.   Prudential Securities Inc., the brokerage unit ofPrudential Insurance Co. of America, agreed to pay $10.5million. That is in addition to a $20 million paymentPrudential agreed to make to settle litigation by investorsin non-public VMS-sponsored limited partnerships. Prudential,which marketed some $650 million of the $1.1 billion inVMS-sponsored limited partnership interests, also sold about$500 million of the $1.2 billion in offerings for the publicfunds.   A Prudential official called the proposed settlement &quot;areasonable resolution for the interests of all concerned,&quot;and said that, assuming the federal court in Chicago approvesthe settlement, the latest agreement &quot;would conclude themajor litigation against us involving VMS.&quot;   In addition, the funds said, insurance carriers for &quot;anumber of the defendants&quot; will pay about $20.5 million. Anadditional $1 million will come from other defendants,including the appraisers for certain properties.   In settling the suit, none of the defendants admitted toany wrongdoing.   VMS ran into trouble after a number of its complex andhighly-leveraged deals began to unravel; it has beencriticized for over-paying for some of its properties, andfor excessive fees and costs.   In February 1990, VMS Realty suspended payments to itslenders and the funds. The eight public funds subsequentlycut their ties to VMS, hired their own management and droppedthe VMS from their names in favor of Banyan.   The eight funds involved in the settlement are BanyanStrategic Land Trust, Banyan Strategic Land Fund II, BanyanMortgage Investors L.P., Banyan Mortgage Investors L.P. II,Banyan Mortgage Investors L.P. III, Banyan Short Term IncomeTrust, Banyan Hotel Investment Fund and Banyan MortgageInvestment Fund.   The funds said the proposed settlement will put to restthe last litigation it faced.</TEXT></DOC>
