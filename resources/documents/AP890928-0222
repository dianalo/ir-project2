GAO chief Charles A. Bowsher said the much-publicized problemsof waste and mismanagement at the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, which oversees FHA, also are partly to blame.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marines on bulldozers cleared the pathfor volunteers as they began driving carloads of baby food, cannedgoods and clothing into rural areas cut off by Hurricane Hugo.   ``We're trying to get it to people,'' Gloria Pipkin, director ofa relief station in Jamestown on the edge of the Francis MarionNational Forest, said Wednesday. ``We found today a family that didnot have food for three days.''

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's biggest geothermalcomplex is literally running out of steam, casting doubts on aclean technology that had been the very symbol of alternativeenergy.   During the past year, The Geysers, a 30-square-mile region inthe isolated mountains 90 miles north of San Francisco, has seensteam pressure drop at a rate much faster than expected.   The decline is so dramatic it eventually could halve electricityproduction at the 28-plant site, which is owned by severalutilities, according to state Energy Commission Chairman CharlesImbrecht.   That could cost the companies hundreds of millions of dollars,Imbrecht said. California taxpayers also stand to lose millionsbecause the state collects royalties that are tied to electricityor steam production.   Worldwide, there are 67 geothermal fields producing electricityor under development to make power. The rest of the industry iskeeping a close eye on how companies cope with the problems at TheGeysers because of the field's size and nearly 30-year operatinghistory, said John Mock of the U.S. Energy Department.</TEXT></DOC>
