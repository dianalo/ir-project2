In some samplesas many as seven such structures were present. We identify them as transitionsbetween the unconfined electron states and the confined heavy-hole states.For energies below the GaAs signal, intense transitions correspondingto such unconfined electron subbands were also observed. The intensityof the transitions involving unconfined electron subbands decreases withincreasing well width, but is weakly dependent on the mole fraction x.The transmission coefficients are calculated in order to locate the positionsof the unconfined electron subband energies. Good agreement is obtainedbetween the experimental data and the theoretical calculation.</TEXT></DOC>
