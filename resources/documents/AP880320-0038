Gen. Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of the general staff of the Sovietarmed forces, said in the Defense Ministry newspaper, KrasnayaZvezda, that NATO was unreasonably seeking cuts in Sovietconventional military forces.   ``One draws an absolutely definite conclusion that the NATOleadership is trying to impose unilateral disarmament uponsocialist countries, to break the existing structure of the Sovietgeneral-purpose forces and in the final account, attain militarysuperiority,'' Akhromeyev said.   A March 3 declaration by leaders of North Atlantic TreatyOrganization countries called for cuts in Soviet conventionalmilitary forces. NATO says the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact has a 2-1advantage in tanks and artillery.   But Akhromeyev reiterated the Soviet view that NATO and theWarsaw Pact are roughly equal in strength. While NATO calls for areduction in tanks and artillery, it is superior in aircraft andsea power, the general said.   Akhromeyev also criticized NATO for refusing to linkconventional arms and reduction or elimination of tactical, orlong-range, nuclear missiles.   The Soviet Union is willing to meet the West halfway, ``but itsinitiatives should be reciprocated by the other side. It is just awaste of time to demand unilateral disarmament from the USSR,'' hesaid.   NATO has not directly responded to a Warsaw Pact proposal madein June 1986 for a comprehensive plan to cut military forcesthroughout Europe, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union'sUral Mountains, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
