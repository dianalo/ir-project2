The Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, theofficial sponsor of the tribute to the 200-year-old document, gotsome credit from historians for reaching out to the people withsuch things as its pocket-size copies of the Constitution. Butothers faulted it for paying too little attention to seriousscholarship.   Most of the historians interviewed in recent weeks about thebicentennial celebration agreed that Americans learned more aboutthe Constitution and its workings through watching the Iran-Contrahearings on television and reading about the debate on the Borknomination than through any planned activity.   ``My sense is that the commission's work was not particularlysubstantive,'' said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professorat Harvard University, who testified to the Senate JudiciaryCommittee against the Bork nomination. ``Nonetheless, what thecountry experienced proved to be extraordinarily profound becauseof the Iran-Contra hearings and the Bork hearings.   ``You can't help observing how much the public became involvedin discussions on the meaning of the Constitution, the role thecourts should play, the fundamental relationships between theexecutive and legislative branches,'' Tribe said. ``Those topicsusually are discussed just by lawyers.''   G. Edward White, professor of law and history at the Universityof Virginia, agreed that the Bicentennial Commission's efforts``were largely ceremonial.''   ``The ones that have come to my attention basically are on akind of superficial, ceremonial level,'' he said.   In comparison, he said, ``the Bork hearings were one of themajor contributors _ unconsciously so _ to the constitutionaldebate.''   J. Woodford Howard Jr., a political science professor at JohnsHopkins University, recalled that when he went to parties lastsummer and fall, all that people wanted to talk about were the Borkor Iran-Contra hearings.   ``This was the Constitution in action,'' Howard said. ``Bothhearings really drove home the fact that the Constitution is notjust a document, or a fossil, but something that is enduring.''   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, who gave up his place on thecourt to devote full time to heading the Bicentennial Commission,said he believes its work did have an impact on Americans'understanding of the document that guarantees their freedoms.   ``My guess will be there's a higher awareness, a higherconsciousness, not necessarily of the details,'' he said in arecent interview in his office. ``If a free people don't look fromtime to time at their liberties and how they got them, they takethe risk of losing them.   ``Although we succeeded in creating greater awareness, thatdoesn't mean detailed knowledge necessarily,'' Burger added.   A coffee table in Burger's office in the Supreme Court buildingwas covered with recently published books and pamphlets on theConstitution. On it, too, was a cereal box with a short historicalmessage, copies of placemats from fast-food restaurants with shortconstitutional quizzes and a bicentennial calendar.   Louis Harlan, a history professor at the University of Marylandand president-elect of the American Historical Association, was oneof the historians critical of the commission's work.   ``The parades and fireworks have faded into history,'' he said,``but the commission has failed to give us something that willendure and be of use to future generations.''   Burger countered that the commission's work will lead to a wideraudience for scholarly works and noted that other governmentagencies have financed studies on the Constitution.   The commission stated at the start of its work that it wanted toteach Americans more about the Constitution. It cited a survey thatfound that about half of the public could not identify the purposeof the Constitution or explain what the Bill of Rights is.   Burger said no survey of Americans' knowledge of the documenthas been taken in the wake of last year's tribute, which reached azenith last Sept. 16 with a party on the Capitol steps inWashington and with a ceremony in Philadelphia the next day.   Henry Steele Commager, a historian at Amherst College, said hedid not believe it was possible to measure the success of thebicentennial activities.   ``What is the criterion for success for a party?'' he asked.``If you want to know if people learned anything, who knows?Obviously, the lessons of Watergate didn't teach Mr. Reagananything about the Constitution.''   Howard said the mood of the country for the Constitution'sbicentennial was one of introspection. ``We were worrying aboutwhether we have dropped the torch, and I think the Iran-Contrahearings and Bork hearings really brought that feeling home.   ``This time, we had the Constitution in action,'' Howard added.``Those hearings brought the Constitution to life.''</TEXT></DOC>
