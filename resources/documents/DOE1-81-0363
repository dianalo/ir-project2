<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0363 </DOCNO><TEXT>A general relativistic Hamiltonian is derived which describes energy,phase and centre coordinates of an accelerated particle in an AVF cyclotron.In this Hamiltonian terms are present which results from coupling betweenthe azimuthally varying magnetic field and the acceleration structure.One example of this coupling is the well known gap crossing resonance.We find that for certain combinations of the magnetic field symmetrynumber N and the number of dees a new term may be present in the Hamiltonianwhich affects the energy and the centre position phase of the particle.As an example this term has been given for the minicyclotron ILEC inconstruction at the University of Eindhoven (having N = 4, two dees for2nd harmonic acceleration and two flattop dees in order to obtain a welldefined energy in the extracted beam). The derivation of the Hamiltoniancombines theories for non-accelerated and accelerated particles developedearlier in our group. The theory for non-accelerated particles was reformulatedsuch that the acceleration process could be incorperated easily. Thetreatment of acceleration has been generalized such that most practicaldee systems, including spiral dees, are incorperated. Furthermore, differentdee systems are treated simultaneously. The final Hamiltonian containsonly slowly varying terms so that the equations of motion derived fromit can be integrated easily on a small computer.</TEXT></DOC>
