A recent list of most popular videocassette sales in Billboardmagazine listed five such tapes in the top 20: ``Callanetics,''``Start Up With Jane Fonda,'' ``Jane Fonda's Low Impact AerobicWorkout,'' ``Jane Fonda's New Workout,'' and ``Kathy Smith's BodyBasics.''   It was Jane Fonda who helped establish the ``how-to'' video in1982 with her original ``Jane Fonda's Workout Tape.'' She was thefirst major Hollywood star to do an original production for thehome video market; there have been nine Fonda tapes since then.   Other actresses have gotten into the video exercise act, too.Racquel Welch produced ``Racquel Total Beauty and Fitness'' andDebbie Reynolds offers ``Do It Debbie's Way.''   Recently, former Yakima, Wash., housewives Sharlyne Powell andSharon McConnell produced an exercise tape for large women.   The $160,000 production was financed by the women and televisionhost Robb Weller, of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and the ``Home''show. They are splitting the profits 50-50.   The video, which sells for $29.95, is produced by Women AtLarge, a chain of exercise studios begun in 1983 by the twoself-described bored housewives.   The clubs cater to the 30 million women in the nation who wearclothes size 16 or above. Instructors average 175 pounds, and thegoal is to build fitness and self-esteem, not lose pounds.   The tape features the women's program of low-impact aerobicsthat does not include the running, jumping and jogging they feelcan damage a heavier body.</TEXT></DOC>
