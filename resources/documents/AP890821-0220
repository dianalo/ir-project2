The steep increase partly was due to areas drying out from theheavy rains brought on by Hurricane Chantal several weeks ago, saidIke Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations and economistfor Baker Hughes.   The increase, however, was somewhat anticipated, he said.   ``All the surveys done said there would be more drilling in thesecond half of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't have asteady increase for the remainder of the year.''   In Texas, which accounted for more than half of the total rigincrease, the drilling activity was focused the east and northcentral portions of the state, Kerridge said.   A year ago, the count totaled 937, Baker Hughes said Monday.   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producingoil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the rig count since 1940.   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in therig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes begancompiling figures.   Among major oil producing states, Texas had the biggest gain with27 followed by Ohio, six; Kansas and Wyoming, three each; Californiaand Pennsylvania, two each; and Michigan, one.   North Dakota posted a loss of two and Colorado and Louisiana lostone each. New Mexico and Oklahoma saw no change from last week.</TEXT></DOC>
