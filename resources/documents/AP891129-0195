The national survey, focusing mainly on energy and environmentalissues, also found that most people believe the federal governmentshould put more research focus on renewable energy sources such assolar power and less on fossil fuels such as oil.   The poll said a slim majority of Americans believe the qualityof their local environment has neither deteriorated in recent yearsnor will in the near future.   Smog, global warming and other threats to the atmosphere are themost troublesome of the environmental problems facing the nationnow, according to the poll results.   The survey was conducted by Vince Breglio, chief pollster forPresident Bush's 1988 campaign, and sponsored by the Union ofConcerned Scientists, a public interest group.   In the polling sample of 1,200 registered voters interviewed inlate October and early November, 76 percent said the best way tomeet future needs for electricity is to improve energy efficiency,rather than building new power plants.   When asked, ``Would you favor or oppose a proposal to build morenuclear power plants in the United States,'' 45 percent said theywould strongly oppose it.   Seventeen percent described themselves as somewhat opposed tomore nuclear power, 17 percent were somewhat in favor and 16percent were strongly in favor. Four percent didn't know or didn'tanswer.   Anti-nuclear groups said the poll showed the nuclear industry,in trying to persuade the public of a need for expanded use ofatomic energy, is out of step with most Americans.   ``The results reinforce a long-term trend over the past 14years, showing increasing opposition to more nuclear powerdevelopment in the United States,'' said Scott Denman, director ofthe Safe Energy Communications Council.   The industry says its polls have shown a recent increase inpublic acceptance of nuclear energy.   At a nuclear industry conference in San Francisco on Wednesday,utility executives predicted that growing power demands willrequire greater use of nuclear energy.   James J. O'Connor, chairman of Chicago's Commonwealth EdisonCo., the nation's largest nuclear utility, called new nuclear andcoal plants the ``ideal way'' to meet growing power demands.   The Breglio poll also said that 63 percent of respondentsbelieve their local environment has improved or stayed the sameover the past three years. Thirty-six percent said it was not asgood.   When asked about the coming three years, 51 percent said theyexpected their environment to either improve or stay the same,while 45 percent said it would worsen.   The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
