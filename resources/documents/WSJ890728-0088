The Treasury's 30-year bond rose nearly one point, or $10 for every $1,000 face amount, while its yield fell to 8.02%. Yields on some intermediate-term bonds, especially those with five-year maturities, fell to the lowest level in several years.    &quot;Trading was very heavy,&quot; says James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. That was a welcome change for bond salesmen who have complained about the slow pace of trading activity in recent weeks.    Michael J. Moore, manager of government trading at Continental Bank in Chicago, says widespread speculation that Fed easing will continue -- although perhaps not right away -- brought bond buyers of all stripes into the market.    The Fed sent strong signals Wednesday that it had eased credit by allowing the closely watched federal funds rate to drift lower. The rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, averaged 9%, down from its range earlier this month of 9 1/4%. Yesterday, the rate drifted as low as 8 15/16%, but averaged about 9%.    In response to the decline, a few more banks lowered their prime lending rate. The largest to do so was NCNB National Bank, an NCNB Corp. unit, which lowered the rate to 10.5% from 11%, matching Chase Manhattan Bank's July 10 cut. In the futures market, traders say there were signs that investor sentiment has moved from cautiously bullish to strongly bullish in just one week. &quot;We saw a really big jump in volume of bond futures trading, double what it was at the beginning of the week,&quot; says Richard L. Sandor, senior vice president of financial futures and options at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;When you find prices moving up on extremely large volume, that is a sign&quot; that a lot of people believe interest rates will continue to fall.    Meanwhile, investors bid aggressively for the $9 billion of new one-year Treasury bills at yesterday's government auction. The average rate on the new bills was 7.22%. That was down from 7.58% at the previous 52-week bill auction on June 29 and was the lowest rate since 7.04% at the June 30, 1988 auction.    The bond market got off to a strong start after the Commerce Department reported that gross national product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7% in the second quarter. That was down from 3.7% in the first quarter.    Also contributing to the gains was news of a sharp rise in initial claims for state unemployment insurance.    &quot;That piece of news suggests that the employment numbers coming out next week will be weaker,&quot; says Mr. Capra, refering to the July employment report set to be released next Friday.    Treasury Securities    Treasury bonds ended higher in heavy trading.    The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late yesterday at a price of 109 16/32 compared with 108 18/32 Wednesday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 108 6/32 compared with 107 13/32 Wednesday. The issue's yield fell to 7.88%.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted at a discount rate of 7.91% for a bond equivalent yield of 8.16%. The latest six-month Treasury bills were quoted at a discount rate of 7.56% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.95%.    Here are details of Treasury's one-year Treasury bill auction yesterday:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year. @ 52-Week @ Applications .......................... $31,640,910,000 @ Accepted bids ......................... $9,036,600,000 @ Accepted at low price ................. 50% @ Accepted noncompetitively ............. $550,140,000 @ Average price (Rate) .................. 92.700 (7.22%) @ High price (Rate) ..................... 92.720 (7.20%) @ Low price (Rate) ...................... 92.700 (7.22%) @ Coupon equivalent ..................... 7.75%    The bills are dated Aug. 3 and mature Aug. 2, 1990.    Corporate Issues    Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/2 point higher in moderate trading.    Public Service Co. of New Hampshire's bonds soared on news that Northeast Utilities made a $1.9 billion bid for the financially troubled utility. Northeast Utilities said the bulk of the offer, $1.62 billion, would be paid as cash to creditors.
