The relationsproposed by Payne et al. and by Williams and Soler can be obtained fromthe first-born approximation by applying additional decoupling approximations.A numerical example is presented to contrast the behavior of the Green'sfunction and finite-difference solutions to the steepest-descents dynamics.14 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
