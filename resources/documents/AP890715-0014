(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coal miners in at least three states agreedto return to work this weekend, complying with the United MineWorkers union in its bid to end a monthlong wildcat strike.   About 15,250 miners in Indiana, Alabama and Illinois decided toreturn to work beginning with shifts at midnight Friday andcontinuing through the weekend, UMW officials said.   ``There may be a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said UMWDistrict 11 international executive board member Roger Myers inIndiana.   ``We're just pleased that the miners have chosen to return totheir jobs,'' said Kevin Feeney, a spokesman for AMAX CoalIndustries Inc.   But miners in Kentucky said Friday they would stay off theirjobs. The situation of miners in West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee andPennsylvania was unclear. Wildcat strikes in Virginia and Missouriended last month.   UMW President Richard Trumka on Friday ended a five-day``memorial period,'' a contract-sanctioned work stoppage that hadaffected 60,000 union miners east of the Mississippi River.   He also asked 37,000 wildcat strikers _ included among thoseparticipating in the memorial period _ to go back to work on theirnext scheduled shifts.   The UMW international executive board meets July 26, and Trumkaasked the miners involved in the wildcat strikes to return to workat least until then.   The wildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of the UMW's strikeagainst Pittston Coal Group Inc.   That strike, idling 1,900 UMW members in Virginia, West Virginiaand Kentucky, began April 5 and showed no signs of ending.   Also Friday, a federal judge in Virginia said he wanted to talkwith Trumka and Paul Douglas, head of The Pittston Co., parentcompany of Pittston Coal. Trumka accepted; Douglas gave no word.   Only a small group of miners were scheduled to work today, andunder the union's contract, no work is permitted at undergroundmines on Sundays.   ``I anticipate a major return starting Sunday night and Monday,''said UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran.   Trumka called the memorial period last week in an attempt to calmthe coal fields, where non-union coal shipments have been met byshootings, rocks and ``jack rocks,'' nails specially welded toflatten tires.   As Trumka called on the strikers to return to work, violenceerupted again in the coal fields. Two company guards were shot andwounded at Hampden Coal Co. near Gilbert, and a bomb damaged areplacement miner's car at Pittston Coal's headquarters in Lebanon,Va.   Coal company officials this week blasted West Virginia Gov.Gaston Caperton and state police for letting the strikers get out ofhand. Caperton and state police have defended their actions, sayingthe coal fields are under control.   However, no arrests had been made in any of the incidents ofviolence that have marked the wildcat strikes, and the U.S.attorney's office in Charleston said Friday it will begininvestigating such incidents.   Tension was evident after the Hampden shootings.   Hampden Coal President Sid Young III _ speaking with two handgunsstrapped to his body, and flanked by two men toting semi-automaticweapons _ decried the violence. But he said his employees will notbe intimidated by the 150 miners camped out in front of his minebeside U.S. 52.   ``I'd hate to be in the first 50 guys who try to stop'' shipmentsout of the mine, he said.   On the Hampden picket line, most union members refused to talk toreporters. An Associated Press reporter was escorted from the siteby a miner who held an ax handle pressed against the reporter's head.   ``If ya'll know what's good for you, you'll stay away,'' theminer said.</TEXT></DOC>
