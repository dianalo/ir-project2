The slaying of Khalil Wazir 1,500 miles from Israel on April 16bore the fingerprints of the Mossad, the agency responsible foractivities outside Israel's borders. By all accounts it was quick,decisive, carried out with split-second timing and backed byIsrael's air and naval forces.   Israel's intelligence has been able to gather preciseinformation on locations of homes or installations and themovements of bodyguards. Teams have been able to make pinpointattacks and often escape without detection.   Although Israeli officials declined public comment, Israelisources privately acknowledged the killing was planned by theagency, approved by the government and carried out by elite Israelicommandos. Tunisia accused Israel of carrying out the assassination.   Israel's intelligence services have planted an agent in Syria,found and kidnapped Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann from Argentinain 1960, participated in the dramatic rescue of Israeli hostagesheld at Entebbe Airport in Uganda in 1976 and the bombing of Iraq'snuclear reactor in 1981.   The Mossad has earned a reputation for carrying out imaginative,high-risk operations to rescue Israeli captives or punish thosebelieved responsible for planning and carrying out attacks againstIsraelis.   ``Because of our special circumstances _ namely we are poor,small and surrounded by belligerent countries _ the Israeliintelligence is of utmost importance,'' said Meir Amit, head of theMossad from 1963 to 1968. ``We have to have ears and eyes beyondour borders.''   ``If you can bang in the nail in one hit instead of two, yousave money and energy. But to do that, you have to know where thehead of the nail is,'' Amit told The Associated Press. ``That'swhere the Mossad comes in.''   Despite some public failures, Israeli intelligence has beeneffective, and the Wazir operation fits the pattern.   Wazir, 52, also known as Abu Jihad, was deputy to PalestineLiberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat and head of the PLO'smilitary operations.   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted Italian military officials,who it did not identify, as saying a Boeing 707 reportedly involvedin the raid may have passed through international air space underdirection of Italian air traffic controllers.   Italy's air traffic control center confirmed to The AP that ittracked an Israeli plane identifying itself as a civilian aircraftshortly before the commando attack at Wazir's house on theoutskirts of Tunis.   Israelis say Wazir organized a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35Israelis were killed and a Tel Aviv hotel takeover in 1975 in which11 hostages were slain.   More recently, Israelis contend he was the mastermind behindnearly five months of Arab unrest as well as two successfulguerrilla infiltrations in which nine Israelis were killed.   Founded in 1951, the agency is responsible for covert activitiesoutside the country, as is the CIA. Unlike the CIA, however, theIsraeli organization is so secret that Israeli law bars publishingthe name of the current Mossad chief. The agency is viewed as keyto Israel's survival.   The agency is helped by the fact that Israel, because it is anation of emigrants, has among its ranks Jews born in Arabcountries who speak Arabic and can easily fit into enemyenvironments.   Eli Cohen, the legendary Israeli spy who developed closefriendships with Syrian government and military leaders, is aclassic example.   The Egyptian-born Cohen, posing as an Arab, provided Israel withcritical information from 1960 until 1965, when he was unmasked,tortured and hanged by the Syrians.   In addition, many Jews who do not live in Israel feel a sense ofloyalty to the Jewish state.   In 1966, the Mossad used an American woman to persuade an Iraqifighter pilot to defect to Israel with his Soviet-built MiG-21fighter sought by Israeli military intelligence.   Mossad agents also were led to Eichmann by a tip from a Germanofficial who was Jewish.   Although few details have yet emerged, the Wazir killing appearsto bear the most similarity to the 1973 raid on PLO offices inBeirut in which three top PLO officials, including Wazir'spredecessor Kamel Adwan, were killed.   As in the Wazir killing, that operation involved seabornecommandos who managed to carry out the killings on enemy territorydespite the presence of armed guards.   The leader of that earlier raid was Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, nowthe head of military intelligence who reportedly helped organizethe Wazir killing.   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's deputy chief of staff, plannedthe 1973 raid. According to Israeli sources, Barak was the officerwho personally saw off the commandos who went to Tunis to gun downWazir.   Israel also had experience making the long trip to Tunis overthe Mediterranean Sea. In 1985 Israel bombed PLO headquarters inTunis, reportedly killing 50 people including an Arafat bodyguard.   There have been some failures. The Mossad was criticized forfailing to adequately warn Israeli leaders of an Arab militarybuild-up prior to the 1973 Yom Kippur War.   In addition, Israeli agents killed the wrong man in July 1973 intheir hunt for an Arab guerrilla in Lillehammer, Norway. The 1972Ben-Gurion Airport massacre, in which Japanese Red Army guerrillaskilled 26 people and wounded 72 in the Israeli passenger terminal,was a serious security lapse.   Wazir's killing was approved by key government ministers,according to Israeli sources.   But two, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Ezer Weizman, aCabinet minister without portfolio, publicly expressed displeasurewith the assassination, fearing it could kill U.S.-backed peaceefforts and fuel greater Arab extremism.   ``At the very time that Israeli leaders are primarily concernedwith calming the territories, the elimination of Abu Jihad is liketossing an enormous amount of fuel on the flames,'' wrote the dailyHadashot.   ``Moreover, if the PLO leaders are to be eliminated, with whomthen do we intend to discuss the issue of settling the Palestinianproblem?''   Many Israelis, however, feel Wazir's assassination provided somelong-awaited good news.   ``Whether or not Israel did it, there is no question that we hadnot only the right, but the obligation to kill people like AbuJihad,'' said Uzi Landau, a legislator from the right-wing Likudbloc. ``Such a success in our fight against terrorism cannot helpbut be met here with praise and enthusiasm.''</TEXT></DOC>
