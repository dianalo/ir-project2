President Vinicio Cerezo asked Guatemalans to remain calm,saying, ``The situation is under the control of the government andthe army of Guatemala.''   The capital was calm by midafternoon with tanks and soldiers offthe streets and business back to normal.   Defense Minister Alejandro Gramajo said rebel air force troopsbacked by two helicopter gunships and an A-37 warplane blocked twomajor highways on the south and northeast edges of the capital.Gramajo said rebel troops also tried to march on his home.   He said the rebels turned back when they encountered a superiorforce of loyalist troops.   The defense chief said at least 300 rebel soldiers wereinvolved. He gave no other troop figures.   The rebellion was crushed without a shot being fired, Cerezotold a news conference hours after the uprising.   Cerezo and Gramajo said the attempt was staged by an air forcetactical unit based at the international airort south of GuatemalaCity. It was led by at least 10 current, retired or cashieredmilitary officers, including several who took part in a faileduprising on May 11, 1988, they reported.   In that attempt, two columns of troops marched on Guatemala Citybut were turned back without gunfire. Six officers were arrested.   Gramajo said two colonels, a captain and a major cashiered fortaking part in last year's attempt were involved in Tuesday'srebellion.   ``The officers ... came up with this way of celebrating lastyear's coup attempt and keeping the movement alive,'' he said.   Cerezo and Gramajo said all but two high-ranking officersinvolved in Tuesday's plot were in custody. An unspecified numberof soldiers were also arrested.   The president said civilians apparently were not involved, asthey were last year.   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatervoiced strong, continued U.S. support for the government.   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said he received reports the real target may have been Gramajo oranother minister. Gramajo repeatedly has said the time has come forreal civilian government in Guatemala.   Guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment. Itis widely agreed civilian authority now exists only with militaryconsent and supervision.   Gramajo said loyalist troops, tanks and artillery took updefensive positions at strategic sites after the plot surfaced atabout 5 a.m.   Loyalist troops identified themselves by wearing blue kerchiefsat their necks. Most of them returned to barracks by 8:30 a.m.after the rebel aircraft returned to base.   Cerezo said rebels tried to seize radio and TV to broadcast acommunique. He refused to divulge the contents, saying it would beused as evidence in military tribunal proceedings.   Gramajo told The Associated Press in August, ``The army is doingeverything possible so that the era of coups pertains to the past.Nonetheless, the traditional forces are doing everything possibleso that it does not. As of now, I'm winning.''   The ``traditional forces'' are rightist landowners and businesspeople who forged strong alliances with the military during yearsof military rule.   Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, took office in January 1986,heading the first elected civilian administration in 16 years. Histerm ends in 1991.   The right wing attacked him for his economic policy,particularly on tax reform, and for trying to open talks withleftists who have waged guerrilla war for 30 years.   On April 16, Cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for agrowing wave of violence.   The international community widely shunned Guatemala because ofhuman rights abuses during military rule here.   The armed forces and death squads linked to the military wereblamed for killing tens of thousands of people, many of themIndians who make up more than half of Guatemala's 8.5 millionpeople. The army denies it.   The Central American nation, about the size of Tennessee, isbounded on the north and west by Mexico, the south by the PacificOcean and the east by El Salvador, Honduras and Belize.   Guatemala refuses to say how big its standing army is, but theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies estimated totalcombined security and defense forces at 52,000 at the end of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
