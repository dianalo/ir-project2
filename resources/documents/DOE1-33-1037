<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-33-1037 </DOCNO><TEXT>Alnus has been identified as a leading species for the intensive cultureof biomass because of its rapid growth and symbiotic nitrogen-fixingcapabilities. To date there has been relatively little genetics workwith the genus. A genetics improvement program for Alnus will benefitthe continuing development of the genus for woody biomass production.The top 1% of trees in an existing provenance test of Alnus glutinosain northern Wisconsin, central Iowa, and southern Illinois are beingused as the parents in a breeding and clonal propagation program. Treeshave been selected for biomass production, climatic adaptability, andresistance to Phomopsis canker and the European leafminer (Fenusa dohrnii).Hybrid vigor is being sought by utilizing inter-provenance and inter-speciescrosses. Progeny testing will be conducted across a range of environments.As this project progresses, it will make available improved plantingstocks to other researchers and to production programs. The status ofthe field tests is described.</TEXT></DOC>
