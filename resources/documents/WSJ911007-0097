The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights said in its reportthat 17 million people are now refugees, and that as many as35 million more have been displaced within their owncountries, mostly because of civil war.</LP><TEXT>   The report, while praising improvements in some countries'treatment of refugees, warned that many nations are taking aharsher approach to people seeking asylum. The report alsosaid that turmoil in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europeportends a new flood of refugees at a time when WesternEurope is tightening its borders in a fortress-like approach.   &quot;With the demise of the Cold War, many people assume thatwe'll see fewer refugees because refugees have long beenconsidered pawns used by the East and the West,&quot; said ArthurHelton, director of the committee's refugee project andeditor of the report. But instead, the number is likely toincrease, he said, as ethnic tensions within Eastern Europeannations boil over.   &quot;The governments of Western Europe are fearful that theircountries will be the places of asylum for countless newrefugees,&quot; he said.   At the same time, the end of the Cold War &quot;has changed thecontext in which refugee protection is addressed,&quot; the reportsaid. &quot;Foreign policy ceases to be a motivating force toassist and protect refugees.&quot;   World-wide, the committee reported that Africa has thelargest number of dispossessed people, including 5.8 millionrefugees and 13 million people still within their nation'sborders but unable to return to their homes because of civilwar. In the Sudan, which has been ravaged by civil war foreight years, about four million people -- 18% of its totalpopulation -- have been forced to flee their homes.   The report said the largest displacement of a singlenational group is the five million Afghans in Pakistan andIran, who are awaiting the end of fighting between rebels andthe Afghanistan government.   The group cited Hong Kong's and Malaysia's treatment ofso-called boat people fleeing Vietnam as among the worsthandling of refugees.   The group said Malaysia's policy of routinely redirectingboats carrying Vietnamese asylum seekers has resulted inhundred of deaths. And the report said that &quot;disturbingliving conditions in the Hong Kong detention centers are thedirect result of an inhumane detention policy . . .purposefully implemented to deter additional asylum seekersfrom coming to Hong Kong.&quot;   The group praised recent changes in the U.S. asylumprocess, particularly new rules creating a corps of speciallytrained asylum officers. As part of the Immigration andNaturalization Service, these officers will review asylumapplications. But the lawyers committee, which worked withthe INS to set up the corps, called for similar training forimmigration judges.   The group also said that unless the new system receivesmore than the $6 million currently budgeted for its firstyear, &quot;the new scheme may be handicapped from the outset.&quot; Inthe year ended Sept. 30, 1990, about 150,000 people soughtasylum in the U.S.; the INS has a backlog of about 100,000asylum applications.   The committee also called for changes in the definition of&quot;refugee,&quot; first set by the U.N. Refugee Convention in 1951.That definition, adopted by 109 countries, applies to peoplewho can't return to their home countries because they will bepersecuted for their race, religion, nationality, membershipin a particular social group, or political opinion.   The lawyers group said that definition doesn't address thesituation of many of today's asylum seekers, who are fleeingviolence in their homelands. It also called for changes toimprove the legal rights of people displaced within their ownnations.</TEXT></DOC>
