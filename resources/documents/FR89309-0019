The authority for these regulations is containedin the Dairy and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, as amended (7 U.S.C. 511r)(``the Act'') and the Tobacco Inspection Act (U.S.C. 511-511q).The term ``banned pesticide'' is presently defined in section 29.401(p)with a reference to pesticides which have been canceled, suspended, revoked,or otherwise prohibited under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and RodenticideAct (``FIFRA'') (7 U.S.C. 135 <T3>et seq.</T3>). However, the term is used by various national and internationalorganizations and others to refer to pesticides the use of which has beencompletely prohibited in a particular jurisdiction. In order to avoid anypossible confusion, this proposed rule would substitute the term ``prohibitedpesticide residue,'' which would be defined as any pesticide residue exceedingthe maximum concentration of residue for a specific pesticide or combinationof pesticides as set forth in andSection; 29.427. Also, conforming changeswould be made in andSection; 29.401(u), the definition of ``Testing,'' andandSection; 29.429, ``Disposition of imported tobacco exceeding pesticideresidue standards.''When the initial regulations concerning pesticide residues in tobacco wereissued (51 FR 30196, August 22, 1986), it was stated in the supplementaryinformation that the list of pesticides for which residue limits were establishedwould be subject to revision from time to time as the circumstances require.The list comprises those pesticides which are not approved for use on tobaccoin the United States (i.e., those pesticides which have been canceled,suspended, revoked, or otherwise prohibited under FIFRA) but which arenot known or believed to be used on tobacco in foreign countries and forwhich reliable testing methodologies exist. Based upon information obtainedfrom the Tobacco Pesticide Committee of the Tobacco Workers Conference,this proposed rule would add the following pesticides to the list in andSection;29.427: DDE, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), lindane, methoxychlor, tamaron, andcypermethrin. Maximum allowable concentrations of residues for these pesticideswould be established in the manner described below. The program for testing flue-cured and burley tobacco for pesticide residueshas been under continual review since its inception. Initially, the maximumallowable concentrations of pesticide residues were established by analogyto the residue tolerances established by the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA), for food crops. The agency now believes that the program could beplaced upon a more appropriate scientific footing. In proposing new maximumallowable concentrations of residues, the Department has relied upon researchconducted by several land grant universities, information from the CodexAlimentarius Commission, published scientific literature, regulations ofthe Environmental Protection Agency, data from the Department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) domestic tobacco monitoringprogram, and data on pesticide residues in imported tobacco collected bytesting imported tobacco under the present regulations. This informationis available for inspection at the same address as for the comments. During the 2\1/2\ years that the regulations have been in place, over 14,000samples of imported flue-cured and burley tobacco have been tested forpesticide residues. The resulting data provide norms for expected pesticideresidue levels. Residues significantly in excess of expected levels wouldindicate that good agricultural practices may not have been followed inthe production of that tobacco. Consideration has been given to sourcesof pesticide residues which would not be inconsistent with good agriculturalpractices, such as incidental drift from the spraying of adjacent fieldsand unavoidable exposure to contaminated soil and ground water. Some pesticides are persistent and degrade very slowly in the environmentand thus may continue to occur in tobacco for many years after applicationof the pesticide has ceased. Limits for these unavoidable residues wouldbe based upon the levels that are unavoidable in domestically grown tobacco.The proposed level for persistent pesticides were derived by analyzingresults of tobacco monitoring samples taken from various areas of the UnitedStates. The pesticides involved are DDT, TDE, DDE, aldrin, dieldrin, toxaphene,heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), formotion,and dibromochloropropane (DBCP). The available data for the pesticides dicamba, 2,4,^D, methamidophos, cypermethrinand permethrin are more limited than that for other pesticides. Althoughall of the proposed maximum allowable concentrations of residue are subjectto change as new data may become available, the proposed levels for thesepesticides would be denominated ``temporary'' in order to indicate a greaterlikelihood of revision. Interested persons are particularly invited tosubmit suggestions and data concerning the temporary levels at any time.These may be sent to the address given above for submitting comments onthis proposed rule.As is presently the case, no maximum allowable concentration of residuewould be set below 0.1 ppm because this is the limit of reliable measurement.The Act prohibits the entry into the United States of imported flue-curedand burley tobacco which is found to contain prohibited pesticide residues.The importer is required to complete a Pesticide and End User Certificationform at the time of importation and must certify either that the tobaccois free of prohibited pesticide residues, or that it will not move in commerceuntil it has been tested and found to meet the tobacco pesticide residuerequirements. Tobacco certified as not containing prohibited pesticideresidues is subjected to random sampling and testing. If the test resultsare positive, the importer may request a retest. The testing process inherentlyinvolves a delay between the time samples are taken and the time that testresults are available. In order to prevent the entry and use of tobaccolater found to be contaminated, and to preserve the integrity of the testingand retesting process, it is necessary to require that imported flue-curedand burley tobacco not be mixed, blended, manipulated, altered, processed,manufactured, moved, shipped or transported from the point of entry untilit has been determined that the tobacco does not exceed the maximum allowablepesticide residue concentrations set forth in andSection; 29.427. This proposedrule would establish these requirements in a new andSection; 29.431.This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures establishedto implement Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 andhas been determined to be ``nonmajor'' because it does not meet any ofthe criteria established for major rules under the Executive Order.The information collection requirements contained in the provisions ofthe regulations that would be amended by this proposed rule have been previouslyapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB No. 0581-0056.Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act,full consideration has been given to the potential economic impact on smallbusiness of this proposed rule. Few, if any, of the firms which would beaffected by these proposed regulations meet the definition of small businessbecause of their individual size. The Administrator, Agricultural MarketingService, has determined that this action would not have a significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities.All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments for considerationin connection with this proposal may file them with the Director, TobaccoDivision, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture,Room 502 Annex Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.For reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that the regulationsin 7 CFR Part 29, Subpart B, be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
