The mice, developed by scientists at Harvard University, will be sold starting next year to researchers in nonprofit academic and government laboratories who are studying the causes of and treatments for cancer. Longer range, Du Pont said it sees a &quot;significant&quot; market for the mice in sales to pharmaceutical and chemical concerns that want to screen potentially carcinogenic products.    Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a major sponsor of the research that led to the development of the so-called transgenic mouse. The company owns exclusive rights to the technology. According to the U.S. Patent Office, the mouse is the first genetically altered animal to be sold commercially. The only patent for such animals issued by the office is for the Harvard-Du Pont invention, though 30 other applications are currently pending, said a spokesman for the office.    Du Pont declined to predict the size of the eventual market for the mice. Each animal will sell for less than $50, about the same price as other specially bred mice, a spokesman said. Du Pont will take orders for the mice, but they will be produced by a commercial breeder, he said.    The advantage of the mice is that they are predisposed to get cancer as a result of the implantation of cancer genes during the embryonic stage of development. The mice can be used to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic or whether new cancer treatments are effective. Scientists believe they will be helpful in leading to better cancer diagnosis, therapy and prevention.    The mice generated considerable controversy earlier this year when they were patented. Critics fear broad consequences stemming from abuses of such genetic engineering. They are particularly concerned, for example, about current research to develop mice that carry the AIDS virus. The fear is that such mice could escape from the laboratories and spread the virus.    Du Pont and others, however, have defended the technology as providing an important tool for research. Until now, such mice have been available only to researchers who could develop them in their own laboratories. The Du Pont mice will be offered first to academic researchers because they have the greatest need for the animals, Du Pont said. </TEXT></DOC>
