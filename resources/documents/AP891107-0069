There were no immediate reports of casualties.   Reporters in Nabatiyeh said at least two helicopter gunshipswere involved in the attack. Smoke billowed from the strickentargets as ground defenders fired at the Israeli aircraft withanti-aircraft guns. No hits were observed.   An Israeli army communique said Hezbollah targets were struck inMazraat Ayn Busiwar, 14 miles north of the Israeli border. ``Alltargets were hit and our planes returned safely to base,'' thecommunique said.   It did say what type aircraft were involved in the raid and didnot mention casualties or damage.   A police spokesman in Lebanon said Hezbollah fighters would notallow police into the area and that it was not known if anyone waskilled or injured.   ``We'll only know if they evacuate any wounded to hospitals inSidon,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   An Israeli army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said several targets were struck. He refused to elaborate.   No reason for the raid was given, but military officials haveseveral times accused guerrillas of Hezbollah of taking part inattacks in the security zone or of attempting to infiltrate Israelthrough the border strip.   Israel established the 6- to 10-mile-wide zone after pulling thebulk of its troops out of Lebanon in 1985, following a three-yearoccupation of the south. The area is intended to preventcross-border raids on Israel.   It was Israel's 13th bombing raid in Lebanon this year and thefirst since September 20 when planes struck a Palestinian base atNaameh, just south of the Lebanese capital of Beirut.   By police count, 17 people have been killed and 103 wounded inthe previous strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
