The near-term pricing trend is down because price discounting appears to be spreading among producers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and because world inventories are perceived to be at high levels. On the other hand, prices could suddenly turn up if OPEC output is dropping as fast as some analysts suggest and if world petroleum demand is as high as was indicated in a new estimate released a week ago by the International Energy Agency.    Resolution of this struggle between major bearish and bullish forces could come within days from OPEC as the actual output of the cartel's 13 members and the extent of the price discounts become clearer.    Oil prices on spot and futures markets were mixed Friday, rising slightly for North Sea crudes but falling for U.S. crudes.    Industry sources said Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin producer, extended market-related pricing -- previously limited to the so-called Aramco companies -- to two more U.S. customers, Ashland Oil Inc. and the Marathon unit of USX Corp. But the Saudis refused to grant the favorable arrangement to European and Japanese oil companies despite the prospect of losing customers.    &quot;I can confirm that it definitely isn't spreading to the (Far) East,&quot; said a disappointed crude-supply official of the Japanese company holding the biggest contract with Saudi Arabia.    Industry experts see significance in the fact that OPEC prices aren't crumbling as fast as widely perceived. &quot;The direction of the market will be dictated by what happens with the discounts,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. &quot;There are selective discounts going on,&quot; he said, &quot;but they are not yet widespread.&quot;    Charles T. Maxwell, Cyrus J. Lawrence's senior energy strategist, suggested the Saudis' limited marketing move &quot;could be read as a favorable factor&quot; for strengthening prices by clearing up uncertainties regarding their plans. But he still foresees OPEC oil prices ranging between $14 and $19 a barrel &quot;for a fairly long time.&quot;    Spot prices of the basket of crudes used to establish OPEC's official $18 benchmark currently average around $16 a barrel versus the estimated $16.50 average of all oil prices. Saudi Arabia still is OPEC's main supporter of the benchmark. But it shuns a former role of reducing its production as demand for OPEC oil drops.    To maintain output near its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia is allowing the four U.S. oil companies that operate Aramco -- Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp. -- to pay market-related prices for contracted volumes totaling 1.3 million barrels a day. The kingdom's production has dipped below four million barrels a day this month, nonetheless, and Saudi Arabia had been expected to broaden efforts to hold sales.    Neither Ashland nor Marathon would comment on the industry reports their payments for Saudi oil now also will be linked to spot prices. Nor would they disclose their Saudi volumes. But industry sources said each buys 75,000 barrels of Saudi oil a day.    Denying they are discounting, the Saudis point to some others in OPEC instead, chiefly Iran. They have escalated their &quot;war&quot; of words with the Iranians, accusing Iran of discounting its oil by $3 a barrel. According to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Iran has just concluded an agreement for increased crude sales to Japanese oil buyers at spot-related prices.    Nevertheless, senior oil officials in Saudi Arabia don't differ much with Mr. Maxwell's price projection for OPEC oil. They are understood to be basing planning on prices falling soon to $14 or $15 a barrel -- at which point, as they see it, there would be a special OPEC meeting to adopt a lower benchmark price or a lower production ceiling.    Because of the perceived glut of oil inventories, changes in the cartel's production level could have a bigger impact on world oil prices than the discounting. &quot;This market is holding together by a hair, and you could see a a $1 or $2 move down any day,&quot; says Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.    But others say prices could rise just as fast if there is clear evidence the cartel's production is declining -- particularly if it should hold at or below the 17 million barrels a day that oil companies estimate as the first-quarter requirement for OPEC crude.    Indeed, production has been going down since the first of the year, largely because buyers are holding out for price discounts. Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's president and Nigeria's oil minister, said last week total output has dropped to between 16 million and 16.5 million barrels a day from December's 18.3 million.    Such bullish news -- on top of last week's announcement by the International Energy Agency of major upward revisions in its estimates of world oil demand -- surprised oil traders, sparking a brief oil-price rally. It also surprised some of Mr. Lukman's fellow OPEC members. &quot;How can that be?&quot; asked a puzzled high-level Venezuelan official. &quot;Only 10 days ago it was 18 million.&quot;    Many industry experts who track OPEC production also are skeptical. But Mr. Lukman isn't out of line with some other new projections of OPEC production including those of Geneva, Switzerland-based Petroconsultants S.A. Still, Arnold E. Safer, president of the Energy Futures Group, said: &quot;The crosscurrents are very confusing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
