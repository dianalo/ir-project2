(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL has officially been sold to Torontoreal estate investor Stephen Mernick, but spurned suitors for thetelevision ministry have left the door open to appeal the decision.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds signed an order Wednesdayformally selling the assets of the Christian ministry to Mernick for$65 million. That gives Mernick 11 days to come up with a $3.25million deposit and 41 days until he can assume administration andoperation of PTL.   PTL has been in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three monthsafter its founder, Jim Bakker, resigned in a sex and money scandal.   The Rev. Sam Johnson, pastor of Heritage Village Church at PTLand president of Heritage Ministries, told said he hasn't given uphis hope to buy Fort Mill, S.C.-based PTL.   Last week, Johnson said PTL's independent religious arm wouldcontinue to raise money in case Mernick's deal falls through. Hesaid Mernick, through extensions, could delay the closing untilSeptember.   ``We plan to buy Heritage USA,'' Johnson said of PTL's Christianretreat. ``That's been our plan all along. Heritage USA has not beensold. No money has changed hands. We don't know that Mr. Mernickwill follow through and put the money down. Obviously, nothing'sbeen sold.''   Johnson said Heritage Ministries has raised $5.4 million, whichis being held in an interest-bearing escrow account.   If Heritage Ministries doesn't get a chance to buy PTL, thedonations but not the interest will be returned, Johnson said. Hesaid the interest is being used to minimize administrative costs ofhandling the money.   Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel also may contest thesale. Bahakel claimed he wasn't given a fair chance to beatMernick's bid, and his lawyer, Faison Barnes, said two weeks agoBahakel would appeal the order.   On Wednesday, Barnes declined to say whether Bahakel would followthrough with an appeal. ``We have to see the order itself to knowexactly what we plan to do,'' he said.   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has said he is willing to deal withHeritage Ministries about keeping alive Christian broadcasting onthe PTL satellite television network. He said in October that he wasinterested in PTL as a real estate deal.   The network, carried on more than 800 cable systems, is amongPTL's most valued assets. Other assets include 1,700 undevelopedacres in northern York County, S.C.; two 500-room hotels, one ofthem unfinished; and a water park.   Once Mernick pays the balance of the $65 million, the money willbe distributed to PTL's creditors.</TEXT></DOC>
