Nguyen Van Linh told the 7th plenum of the party's CentralCommittee that reforms in some socialist lands were causing ``newlyarising difficulties.''   ``We express our profound concern over the danger threatening ... socialism in some fraternal socialist countries.''   He said that Western politicians, including Bush, left ``no stoneunturned in an attempt to affect the situation in a number ofsocialist countries with the aim of driving these into the freeworld of capitalism.''   The plenum was held in Hanoi from Aug. 15-24. A text of Linh'sspeech at the closing session was broadcast Monday on Radio Hanoiand was seen in Bangkok on Tuesday.   ``In a number of socialist countries currently facing manydifficulties, the imperialists and reactionary forces are colluding... to undermine the gains of the socialist revolution,'' Linh said.   He said Vietnam is also affected by this international situation.   Over the past few days, official Vietnamese news reports havedenounced ``counterrevolutionaries'' in Poland, where the firstnon-Communist prime minister for 46 years was appointed last week.   Linh's speech seemed to indicate a predominately conservativestreak in Vietnamese politics, despite some liberal reforms. Hanoiis closed aligned with Moscow, where President Mikhail Gorbachev ismaking major economic and social reforms.   However, the 7th plenum rejected ``bourgeois liberalization,pluralism, political plurality and multi-opposition parties aimed atdenying Marxism-Leninism, socialism and the party's leadership,''Linh said.   He said ``serious shortcomings'' in the Vietnamese party's ownideological work had ``caused certain persons to mistakenly believethat the nature of imperialism had changed.''   Linh accused some party members of ``irresponsible, disorganizedand undisciplined acts'' and of inciting ``a number of people todisturb public order and security and engage in factionalactivities.''   In his criticism of the United States, Linh said Washington hascontinued its space defense program and tightened its ``militarybelts'' around socialist countries.   He charged that it had established arms caches in Thailand andwas ``scheming'' to set up military bases in Singapore.   ``All these acts are part of their menace strategy relying onmilitary strength to oppose the Soviet Union (and) socialistcountries,'' he said.   ``We do not nurture the illusion that the imperialists ... arewilling to achieve peaceful coexistance with us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
