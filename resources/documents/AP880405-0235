(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nebraska's long-running dispute over aconstitutional amendment created to protect family farmers has justtwo points of agreement: It's the toughest corporate farmrestriction in the nation, and the fight's far from over.   Each side claims to be working in the best interest of Nebraskaand its farmers.   The question, according to a leading supporter, Marty Strange,is whether ``Nebraska's ag future will develop on its family farmbase, whether farms in the future will be owned and operated bypeople who live on them and are part of the community that thosefarms are the economic base of.''   John DeCamp, a lobbyist and former state senator, is anoutspoken opponent.   ``It's a handicap to normal business and commerce as conductedin the ... the United States,'' he said. ``A corporation is anormal tool for doing business, just like a combine is a normaltool for processing and harvesting corn.''   The battle over what became Initiative 300 began in the early1970s, as irrigation development and corporate interest inagriculture burgeoned.   The dispute peaked when corporate farming foes, frustrated byyears of legislative inaction, gathered enough signatures to placea constitutional amendment on the 1982 general election ballot.   The amendment ran about 1,100 words, but its basic provisionswere:   _ Non-family farm corporations, with a few exceptions, cannotown agricultural land or engage in farming and cannot own or feedlivestock, except for livestock purchased for slaughter and a fewother kinds.   _ The majority of voting stock in family farm and ranchcorporations must be held by family members, at least one of whommust live on the farm or be actively engaged in the daily labor andmanagement.   _ Individuals and groups can seek enforcement if the secretaryof state or attorney general fails to enforce the amendment.   An emotional campaign preceded the vote. Opponents said theproposal would paralyze economic growth and stifle competition;supporters argued that corporate farming threatened rural economicand social foundations.   Voters approved the amendment, 290,377 to 224,555, but the issueremained unsettled.   Legislators have tried unsuccessfully to pass laws clarifyingthe amendment and to get voters to abolish it.   A court challenge ended when the Nebraska Supreme Court ruledthe amendment constitutional. However, opponents say the court testwas decided on too narrow a question of law and talk of staginganother petition drive to return the issue to the ballot.   Strange, senior associate for the Center for Rural Affairs inWalthill, contends the amendment has done exactly what it wasdesigned to do _ protect family farmers from unfair corporatecompetition.   It is the nation's ``only truly effective'' family farmlegislation because it is in the state constitution and restrictscorporate farming activities as well as land ownership, he said.   Opponents argue that Initiative 300 restricts business, scaresmany companies away from investing in Nebraska, prevents farmersfrom selling land to whomever they choose and affords protectionsthat are unfair, unnecessary and unrealistic.   ``The only way that family farms will be saved iseconomically,'' said state Sen. Dennis Baack, a vocal foe who farmsabout 2,000 acres and raises wheat and sunflowers. ``We need pricesfor our products. Those are the kind of things that will savefamily farms. It's not going to be words in our constitution.''   Another state senator, Ernie Chambers, said Initiative 300hasn't been on the books long enough to assess whether it isrestricting business or helping farmers.   ``The people are the ones who put it there and they did itbecause the Legislature chose not to act,'' said Chambers, whofavors the measure.   A U.S. District Court case, filed earlier this year byopponents, is the first federal test of the amendment. A hearing isscheduled April 18.   The federal lawsuit, filed by Sunrise Ventures Inc., a customcattle-feeding operation, seeks to stop Attorney General RobertSpire from enforcing Initiative 300 on the grounds it violates thecommerce, equal protection and due process clauses of the U.SConstitution.   Sunrise may be in violation of the amendment's prohibitions onownership of livestock, Spire said, but the company appears to beexempt under a provision that allows ownership of animals``purchased for slaughter.'' On that ground, Spire has asked thatSunrise's suit be dismissed.   Amendment opponents hailed Spire's action as a kind ofconcession _ and a victory. DeCamp and Baack said it opened up theissue because all cattle ultimately are slaughtered. ``There arevery few cattle in my district that live to be retired,'' Baacksaid.   Strange called Spire's action irresponsible, but said ``itdoesn't affect the foundation of the family farm amendment at all.''   DeCamp agreed the dispute isn't over. If the Sunrise case isdismissed, opponents will challenge the issues of land ownershipand engaging in farming, he said.   ``This is just the beginning,'' he said. ``I'm sure the nextstage won't be so easy.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 10</NOTE></DOC>
