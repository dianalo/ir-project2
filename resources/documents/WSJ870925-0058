At the same time, paper industry spokesmen tried to discount the significance of a public opinion poll they sponsored last April. In that poll, about three out of five respondents said they would reduce their use of paper products if the items contained low levels of dioxin.    The controversy over paper-product contamination came as the Environmental Protection Agency released a broader, long-delayed study that found less dioxin than expected at most industrial and pesticide-use sites, but more than expected in fish in major U.S. lakes and rivers, especially downstream from some paper mills.    Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, the industry's trade association, released results of laboratory analyses that showed the levels of contamination in paper towels, diapers and writing paper were hundreds to millions of times lower than the amount needed to cause one cancer in a million people. Environmental Protection Agency officials suggested the risks may be higher than that, though generally almost negligible.    &quot;Consumers can continue to have the utmost confidence in the safety and integrity of all paper products,&quot; Mr. Cavaney said.    Still, some executives said the paper industry must be troubled by the detection of the cancer-causing chemical in paper products. &quot;The (paper industry) has to be justifiably concerned,&quot; said William H. Trice, executive vice president, research and development, at Union Camp Corp.    But officials of several paper-products makers insisted that the concentrations of dioxin found are so vanishingly small that little, if any, of the chemical is likely to migrate out of the product and thus come into contact with consumers. They said the dioxin discovery has surprised many since it wasn't until recently that equipment was sophisticated enough to detect such minute traces. &quot;The levels being found are so small that the analytic tools didn't permit detection,&quot; said Mr. Trice. &quot;We are talking about parts per trillion, which is pushing our analytical techniques to their limit.&quot;    Michael Mudd, a spokesman at General Foods Corp., a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos., described the reported levels as &quot;so minute as to be insignificant.&quot; He added, &quot;It's like a drop of vermouth in an Astrodome full of gin.&quot;    &quot;I'm convinced that it's not a real issue,&quot; said Russell Kross, a safety officer at Mead Corp., a Dayton, Ohio-based maker of school and office papers. David I.J. Wang, executive vice president of International Paper Co., New York, said that at the barely detectible levels dioxin is being found &quot;there doesn't seem to be any evidence of personal harm in these personal care or contact products.&quot; Mr. Wang, who is responsible for technology at his company, added, &quot;I think that when we get to the bottom of everything we will find the products are quite safe.&quot;    The paper institute said its studies were done by the California Analytical Laboratory in Sacramento, an independent laboratory, on writing paper, paper towels and paper diapers. Mr. Cavaney said the institute is trying to obtain similar analyses of some other products, but has been slowed by shortage of laboratory capability.    John Moore, assistant administrator of the EPA, said his agency hasn't analyzed the industry studies. In a news conference, he said &quot;arm-chair&quot; calculations done for the agency by Arthur D. Little Co. showed the risk from most paper products &quot;borders on the negligible.&quot; For such things as paper tampons, diapers and towels, he said, the study predicted no more than about one cancer in a million people.    Mr. Moore said the study showed a hundredfold higher risk from use of paper coffee filters, but suggested that more-careful analysis would reduce this to near &quot;negligible&quot; levels as well.    EPA officials confirmed that a paper pulp-bleaching process is blamed for producing dioxin. They said the level of dioxin in fish downstream from some paper mills presented public health problems, but that states where this has been identified have warned against fish consumption. Studies are planned, they said, to determine how many other paper mills are affected, how the dioxin is produced and what can reduce or eliminate it. They said some federal regulation is expected.    American Paper Institute documents, obtained and distributed by the environmental group Greenpeace, indicate that the trade organization has been concerned since February that dioxin taints paper products and might cause consumers to avoid them.    In the telephone poll, 59% of the respondents said they would cut back on paper-product use if dioxin were found in them at &quot;extremely low levels.&quot; Only 31% said they wouldn't reduce paper use, and 34% said paper products' benefits are so great that it makes no sense to reduce their use.    Laurence Wiseman, a vice president of the paper institute, played down the significance of the poll. He said it showed that &quot;people don't have much knowledge&quot; about dioxin and were giving &quot;knee-jerk reactions.&quot; He predicted consumer responses would be different in the face of data showing that levels and risks are low.    Greenpeace questioned the validity of any of these calculations, as all are based on paper-industry data. &quot;It's just not rational to expect much from what amounts to self-investigation,&quot; it said.    The institute's poll showed that the paper industry would have little credibility with the public. Only 10% of respondents found paper-company scientists credible on the subject of dioxin; 7% called paper-company presidents credible. Environmentalists rated 24% and the EPA 33%.    Ellen Silbergeld, a toxic-substances scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the risk from paper products could be far greater than the industry or EPA has suggested. &quot;I think we don't yet know the full story here,&quot; she said. She also suggested that prevention of the problem by switching bleaching processes would be &quot;relatively easy,&quot; a claim the paper institute denied. Mr. Wang said International Paper is conducting studies on &quot;the feasibility of modifying the bleaching process to minimize the generation of dioxin.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
