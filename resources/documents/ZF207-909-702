 Our editors considerthemselves particular experts on the subject of games, since virtually allwear away their keyboards on off-hours at one entertainment or another.andM;What follow are our editors' and writers' unexpurgated reports on theirfavorite Macintosh pastimes.andM;Tetris.andP;  Connie Guglielmo, associate news editor and San Francisco Giantsfan, reports: Tetris, an arcade game developed by Soviet programmer AlexeyPajitnov, is deceptively simple.andP;  To the accompaniment of Russian musicplayed against background drawings that echo Russian life, groupings of foursquares float down the screen.andP;  The object is to rotate and shift thegroupings so that they fit with successive pieces to form solid rows ofsquares.andP;  As rows are completed, you move up to ever higher levels where themusic and backgrounds change and the pieces drop faster.andP;  Glasnost should beso easy.andM;Pretty soon, however, unfinished lines stack up.andP;  When they reach the top ofthe screen, it's &quot;Game Over.&quot; You've racked up a whopping total of onecompleted line, and the Russian music, so quaint at first, becomesirritating.andM;So you turn off the sound and start over.andP;  Pretty soon, days have gone by,your eyes are glazed and you realize you're addicted.andP;  That's when Tetristurns into a game of strategy as well as skill.andP;  By the time you've reachedLevel 9 and scored 100 lines -- the hard way -- you'll feel like you'vemastered the game.andM;If you've already mastered Tetris and are looking for a new challenge,Welltris, a 3-D version of the game, is due out by Christmas.andM;Shanghai.andP;  Elinor Craig, news reporter, can be found playing Activision'sShanghai most days around 6 p.m.: I've been a longtime addict of non-wordgames to ease the stress of deadline pressure, and my current drug of choiceis Shanghai.andP;  It focuses on visual rather than verbal skills.andM;Shanghai is derived from the ancient Chinese game of mah-jongg, and Version2.0 for the Mac II uses beautifully detailed, colored stacks of tiles.andP;  Theobject is simply to remove all the tiles from the screen in pairs, butwinning doesn't come easy.andP;  Version 2.0 can now tell you when you can't makeany more moves, but for those lucky enough to meet with success, a fantasticfire-breathing dragon awaits.andM;SimCity.andP;  Ric Ford, our Boston-based technical editor and self-proclaimedgames hater, says: SimCity from Maxis Software lets you practice desktopDuke'ing.andP;  As a Mike Dukakis-style technocrat, you control the mechanisms ofcity planning and government to bolster the economy and win high approvalratings.andP;  Reigning over your city in a hands-off Reagan-Bush manner won'tkeep pace with the dynamic Sims, the city's simulated citizens, as they buildhouses, shop, drive to work in the factories you create or leave town becausethe crime rate and taxes are too high.andM;Pre-defined city scenarios are included with the game, but it really becomesfun when you create your own city and watch it change dynamically as yourespond to trends and problems.andM;You build roads, homes, industrial districts, police stations and parks; usebulldozers on forests, debris from earthquake damage or fires; set tax rates;and choose between coal and nuclear power plants.andP;  Maps and charts show landvalues, crime rates, construction rates and infrastructure as the animatedcity changes by itself in the main window.andP;  An evaluation panel lets you seehow well the Sim citizens think you're doing as mayor, and messages appear tolet you know when they need help -- more roads, lower taxes or a new powerplant, for instance.andM;SimCity is not a realistic city simulation -- reality is too complex -- noris it a fantasy game.andP;  It lies somewhere in between.andP;  It's a fun way to playpowerful political roles and be stimulated into thinking about the factorsthat shape our cities.andM;SimCity is best in the 1.1c color version, where its maps and icons are muchmore alive.andP;  The color version is not copy-protected like the others are, butit requires a color Mac and 2 Mbytes of RAM.andM;Balance of Power 1990.andP;  Dale Coleman, editor at large and secretary of statewannabe reports: If you liked Mindscape's original Balance of Power, you'lllove the 1990 version.andP;  As in chess and popular adventure games, a lot ofstrategy is involved.andP;  Although many of its assumptions have been supersededby events of the past two years, it incorporates a variety of enhancements,including multipolarity, an advisory function and the availability of tradepolicy as a strategic tool.andP;  Although I found myself playing enthusiasticallyfor hours, the latest version has some serious flaws, not the least of whichis the self-important tone of the documentation.andM;Unfortunately, as well, the only way to save a complex game in progress is toquit.andP;  The copy-protection scheme forces you to periodically refer to thedocumentation in search of a word key, an unwelcome and unnecessaryinterruption when you are deep in thought trying to figure out how to outwitthe enemy.andM;While the playing field is populated with countries with familiar names,assumptions about most nations, and especially those of the third world, arejuvenile.andP;  I only wish there were more regionally specialized,less-politically biased games like it.andP;  For now, Balance of Power is the onlygame in town, and a quite entertaining one at that.andM;Shufflepuck Cafe.andP;  Pam Pfiffner, news reporter and avid pool player: Mostpeople think the opening screen of Broderbund Software's Shufflepuck Cafelooks just like the bar scene in the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot; -- ominous-lookingcreatures milling around a dark and dank bar, quaffing strange brews while apiano tinkles in the background.andP;  To me it looks just like the bar I tendedin Wisconsin, except the patrons are better dressed.andP;  And that's why I likeShufflepuck Cafe so much.andP;  It reminds me of home and it's a hoot to play.andM;The game is like air hockey.andP;  The object is to hit the puck with your paddle,sending it the length of the table with enough force and finesse that itcan't be returned.andP;  Sound straightforward?andP;  Like any other bar gamechallenge, the level of play depends on the opponent.andM;And what a bunch of opponents await you in Shufflepuck Cafe.andP;  You can choosefrom nine different characters.andP;  Their level of contest ranges from easy toimpossible, and half of the game's fun stems from figuring out each player'spersonality.andP;  There's Lexan, whose play seems to deteriorate with each sip ofmartini; Skip, who's so masochistic that he always says &quot;Play again?&quot; evenwhen he just had the pants beat off him; Biff, who growls &quot;Wimp&quot; when youlose; and Visine, my favorite, who has an endearing sniffle.andM;There are ways to cheat in Shufflepuck Cafe, but why bother? Come on down tothe cafe and click on the player of your choice.andP;  It's a game that bothdelights and challenges, and it might be good practice for your next night atthe singles bar.andM;Apache Strike.andP;  Brenda Benner, managing editor and, in her own words &quot;theperson who rails against game-playing before the issue is out the door,&quot;would like to say she doesn't play games.andP;  After all, she has an image touphold as the enforcer of deadlines.andP;  But, in fact, her favorite game isSilicon Beach Software's Apache Strike, which, of course, she plays only athome and then only because it hones her mousing skills.andM;Apache Strike is an action game in which the user flies an Apache helicopterthrough a 3-D grid of what appears to be high-rise office buildings -- sortof like when the Navy's Blue Angels buzz San Francisco's Financial Districtduring Fleet Week.andP;  You do get the feeling of being in the air as you swooparound in search of enemies.andP;  However, real aircraft thankfully have a moreresponsive control mechanism than a mouse.andM;The object of the game is to seek out and destroy the &quot;S.D.C.,&quot; which earnsyou points and advances you to a more difficult level.andP;  At each successivelevel, the number of enemies (tanks and other helicopters) shooting at youincreases and they get faster and meaner in their quest to annihilate you.andO;Shooting all your enemies at each level before getting the S.D.C.andP;  gives youextra bonus points and is the best way to rack up a high score.andP;  A kindwoman's voice warns you of enemies behind and informs you of the damage toyour helicopter.andM;Although Apache has been out since January 1988, I keep coming back to itagain and again.andP;  It's great for unwinding at the end of the day.andP;  (It'scertainly preferable to blast away fictional tanks and helicopters than anyof my hardworking co-workers for missed deadlines.) I like Apache Strike.andP;  Ithas a lot of action, I don't have to think a lot to play, and I didn't haveto read a manual -- and the accompanying music has a good beat and I canreally dance to it.andP;  I'd give it a 95, Dick.andM;Crystal Quest.andP;  Jim Forbes, editor at large and reformed PC WEEK staffer JimForbes on Crystal Quest: I'd much rather zap aliens than learn how to use anew Macintosh spreadsheet.andP;  Few Mac applications are as rewarding as a goodshoot 'em up game.andP;  I've spent a lot of Mac hours launching photon torpedoesat Klingon vessels and dodging alien missiles, but recently I've narrowed mygame playing to a single offering -- Patrick Buckland's Crystal Quest.andM;Crystal Quest doesn't relax you, it drains you.andP;  The object in Crystal Questis simple: Collect as many crystals and cherry bombs as you possibly can,then play until you die.andM;All that stands between you and death at the hands of 12 different types ofaliens are fast reflexes, your spare lives (determined by the number ofpoints you score) and your carefully hoarded arsenal of bombs.andP;  The waves getmore complex as you progress through the game until you finally succumb tothe attack of a parasite, stumble into a mine laid by a pest, getmachine-gunned by a zarklephaser, get bombed by a bane or are blasted by amenace's laser beam.andM;My &quot;lifetime-best&quot; Quest score is 7.01 million.andP;  The session, which startedat 5 p.m.andP;  (after deadline) lasted about two hours.andP;  The game left medrained, and my mouse was damaged.andP;  But, it was great!andM;My addiction started with the first version of Buckland's program (CrystalRaider) and continues unabated with the current version.andP;  A special versionof Crystal Quest includes a &quot;Critter Editor&quot; that lets you choose your ownsound effects and create custom  aliens.andM;NetTrek.andP;  Graphics technician and system administrator Rick Valdez naturallygravitates to network games: With &quot;groupware&quot; the computer catch-phrase ofthe '90s, Premier Technology Inc. is on the cutting edge with one of thefirst groupware games: NetTrek -- The Real Version.andM;Most computer games pit you against a computer-generated enemy.andP;  But such anenemy, no matter how well-crafted, soon becomes repetitious and definitelylacks soul.andP;  NetTrek avoids this rut.andP;  It runs over a LocalTalk network,pitting you against as many as five other human players.andP;  The game operatesin &quot;real time&quot;; as you maneuver throughout the galaxy, others players canreact to your moves instantly.andP;  Of course, if there are no other players, thecomputer will pit you against an enemy of its choosing.andM;At the opening screen each player chooses a race: Terran, Klingon or Romulan.andO;The players also each choose a unique name to identify them in the galaxy.andO;The object of the game is to deploy a star base in each of the eight solarsystems that make up the NetTrek galaxy.andP;  If a player succeeds in deployingall bases, he becomes the ruler of the galaxy; there is no second place.andP;  Ofcourse, the other players are also on this mission -- and a star base, oncedeployed, may be easily destroyed by another player on the network.andP;  Part ofthe strategy of the game is to develop a plan that allows you to deploy basesin other solar systems while at the same time protecting your other basesscattered throughout the galaxy.andM;Each of the ships is armed with photon torpedoes and phaser weapons.andP;  Forprotection there are three levels of shielding.andP;  And, of course, Romulanshave a cloaking device.andP;  The power supply to your ship is not inexhaustible,however.andP;  A delicate balance must be maintained to protect your ship andstill destroy the enemy forces.andP;  All the maneuvering, firing and bombardingcan be controlled either with on-screen buttons and sliding bars or via thekeyboard.andP;  We needed little time to feel proficient blasting through space.andM;NetTrek was originally a black-and-white public-domain game.andP;  PremierTechnology has added much functionality to the game, hence the new name:NetTrek -- The Real Version.andP;  Color also was added, making it more attractiveand easier to see the enemy.andP;  The game also is now fully MultiFindercompatible; play continues even if another application is brought to theforeground.andP;  A player can be destroyed while calculating a spreadsheet.andO;Since battles can become protracted, games can be saved and continued later.andM;Although six players can play at once, each copy of NetTrek allows only twoplayers.andM;For more information on the games re-viewed here, see Product Info on Page87.andM;Sarah and Carolyn Norr, the 9- and 12-year-old daughters of Henry Norr,MacWEEK's news editor, banded together to review their favorite games foryounger Mac users.andP;  Sarah picked the Carmen Sandiego series of detectivegames and Carolyn picked Leprechaun, a full-color arcade game.andP;  Both areprograms that even children over 21 will appreciate.andM;Carmen Sandiego.andP;  In the three Carmen Sandiego games from Broderbund, playerstrack a gang of international criminals.andP;  In a fun and exciting way, itteaches you geography and culture.andP;  The object of the game is to find out whothe criminal is, get a warrant, track the thief to his or her hide-out andreturn the stolen thing.andP;  You start at a low level and work your way up.andP;  Thecriminals have funny names, such as Lotta Style and Ken Hartley Read.andM;&quot;Where in Europe is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; is difficult because it's hard to get awarrant.andP;  You get a warrant by collecting clues.andP;  After you get enough cluesto identify a person, you enter them in a fake computer.andP;  In Carmen Europethe clues are hidden.andP;  I still like Carmen Europe, though, because its gotinformation about Europe's sights and civilizations.andP;  Carmen Europe just cameout on the Mac.andM;In &quot;Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; it's tricky to find out where togo.andP;  Two cities have the same name!andP;  And they can't use flags for cluesbecause all of the cities are in the same country.andM;Carmen World is my favorite game.andP;  It isn't as hard to get a warrant, and Imemorized which countries 30 cities are in.andP;  Carmen Sandiego games are reallyfun!andM;Leprechaun.andP;  The object of Shodan's Leprechaun game is to get a little greenleprechaun to push a pot of gold to the rainbow.andP;  As you move the leprechaunand gold with the mouse, you dodge evil creatures like trolls, snails andbirds; navigate around or sometimes through flower patches, hedges and stonewalls; and collect extra lives, clovers and gold.andP;  The program has prettycolor graphics and sound effects.andM;The game comes with more than 175 levels.andP;  All of them are difficult, andsome seem impossible.andP;  But after we tried out a pre-release version and mysister told the developers it was too difficult, they added a new easiersection called Kiddy Land.andP;  There also is a built-in editor that lets youmake your own levels.andP;  It's fun, but the procedures are confusing.andM;There should be a way for the computer to remember what level you got out onlast time and start you on that level the next time you play, so you don'thave to go through all the levels every time.andP;  Basically, though, it is a funand exciting game.andP;  It's one of my favorites.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
