Sessions early this month rejected a proposal toupgrade the agency's massive computer systems to track suspects who have notbeen charged with crimes.andM;The tracking proposal was part of a $40 million planned upgrade of the FBI'snational Crime Information Center (NCIC).andP;  This enhancement to the NCICcomputer systems, which now contain nearly 20 million records, would haveallowed law enforcement officers to access investigative files on peoplesuspected of involvement in drugs, murder and kidnapping.andM;While Sessions has canceled plans to move ahead on the tracking initiative,he said in a letter to Rep.andP;  Don Edwards (D-Calif.), chairman of the HouseJudiciiary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, that he hasapproved all other portions of the NCIC 2000 project.andM;FBI officials requested money for the project during fiscal 1990 budgetsessions, Sessions said, adding, &quot;The architectural plans to support the newsystem are complete and await budget appropriations.&quot;andM;Edwards has monitored closely the FBI's progress on the systems upgrade andhas called repeatedly for the FBI to drop the tracking proposals.andM;&quot;They pose too many problems in terms of security, privacy and accuracy,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;And it seems that the tracking proposals won't be very useful to lawenforcement anyhow.&quot;andM;A panel of civil rights experts and computer scientists last month harshlycriticized the tracking proposals in a report to Edwards.andM;The report also reiterated concerns about the FBI's lack of plans forimproving data integrity and security.andM;Committee staff members said Edwards is glad the tracking initiatives havebeen rejected and that he will support NCIC improvement plans, but he stillhas questions about specifics of the upgrade.andP;  Edwards plans to hold anoversight hearing in mid-April.andM;&quot;In light of the conclusions in the report, the FBI should go slow onexpanding NCIC,&quot; Edwards said.andP;  &quot;Our experts found that the FBI still has notadequately addressed the accuracy and reliability problems.&quot;andM;While Sessions called the panel report &quot;invaluable&quot; in finalizing the FBImodernization plans, he also said the planned enhancements will &quot;improve dataquality, searching of information and operations.&quot;andM;FBI officials did not give details about the decision to drop the trackingfeatures, but Sessions pointed to the agency's own NCIC Advisory Policy Boardreview as key in the decision.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
