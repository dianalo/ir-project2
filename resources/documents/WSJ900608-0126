JAMIE WHITTEN: Are you aware of any agreement, anyassurance, by yourself or anyone else in high governmentoffice, to Khrushchev that if he would withdraw at the timeunder the conditions that you showed us, the U.S. wouldthereby commit itself to any particular course of action?   SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT MCNAMARA: I am not onlyunaware of any agreement, it is inconceivable to me that ourPresident would enter into a discussion of any suchagreement. Moreover, there were absolutely no undisclosedagreements associated with the withdrawal of the Sovietmissiles from Cuba.</LP><TEXT>   In a recent book, McGeorge Bundy calls Mr. McNamara'spremeditated lie to a congressional committee &quot;most justifieddeception.&quot; The country eventually learned that PresidentKennedy had agreed to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey inexchange for the Soviets ending the missile crisis. &quot;Therecertainly would have been criticism from hardliners in theU.S.,&quot; Mr. Bundy wrote, but &quot;the assurance itself and thesecrecy with which we surrounded it were justified.&quot;   ---   Justified or not, no independent counsel ever prosecutedMr. McNamara. John Poindexter is not so lucky. On Monday,Judge Harold Greene must decide his proper punishment. Mr.Poindexter was not charged with any understandable crime --Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh didn't allege that thediversion of Iran arms sales to the Contras broke any law --but with conspiracy and misleading and obstructing Congress.For this he could get 25 years and a $1.25 million fine.   Judge Greene may feel under some pressure to make Mr.Poindexter the first Iran-Contra defendant sent to jail. Onthe other hand, as the ATandamp;T judge who oversees the U.S.telecommunications industry, Judge Greene hardly needs toprove that he is energetic. But to imprison Mr. Poindexterwould most certainly align the federal judiciary on the sideof congressional criminalizing of policy differences with theexecutive branch.   Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, who has so far spentmore than $28 million, has filed papers demanding that Mr.Poindexter go to jail. &quot;If, as occurred in this case,high-ranking officials of one branch of government feel freeto feed the other branch a diet of lies,&quot; Mr. Walsh wrote inhigh dudgeon, &quot;then the constitutional system will surelysicken and, eventually, die.&quot;   Mr. Walsh didn't show any such concern about lying by hisclients, the Members of Congress who created his job and towhom he must report. While Judge Greene required formerPresident Reagan to testify, he upheld the prosecutor'sobjection to the Poindexter request that some 65 Members ofCongress and their staffers testify about what they knewabout Iran-Contra and when they knew it. In so doing, JudgeGreene accepted Mr. Walsh's argument that it was irrelevantto argue that Members of Congress lied when they said theywere misled about Oliver North's work for the Contras.   Mr. Poindexter testified to Congress that the executivebranch was abiding by the letter and spirit of the Bolandamendments. His meaning was clear to everyone. Congress hadvoted down bills that would have barred all U.S. governmentaid to the Contras. The Boland compromise was that the CIAand other agencies were prohibited from using appropriatedfunds to help the Contras, but the White House and itsNational Security Council could strive to keep the Contrasalive. As President Reagan testified, he would have sent asimilar letter to Congress except that &quot;If I had written itmyself, I might have used a little profanity.&quot;   A National Security Agency staffer testified in thePoindexter case that there were several secret congressionalbriefings during the Boland period about executive-branch aidto the Contras. Still, Rep. Lee Hamilton testified thatBoland was drafted to cover Mr. North. We don't think Mr.McNamara, Mr. Poindexter or Members of Congress should go tojail for these kinds of misleading statements. Does anyonethink we should have indicted Members of Congress who failedto deliver on promised spending cuts after President Reaganraised some taxes early in his term? Should we criminalizeassurances by Congressmen that the pending &quot;civil rights&quot;bill won't create quotas? In our system, voters not jurorsdecide when officials need to be punished for their policies.   So what is suitable punishment for Mr. Poindexter? Mr.North was fined and sentenced to community service fightingdrugs in Washington. How about sentencing Mr. Poindexter tocommunity service lecturing on separation of powers to thenew democratic government in Nicaragua that he did so much tomake possible.</TEXT></DOC>
