(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson accused the DemocraticParty leadership in the South of a ``sustained effort'' to thwarthis presidential candidacy, but said it's not working.   He said he has a two-pronged message that will reap strongsupport for him on Super Tuesday, with its round of caucuses andprimaries, concentrated in the South.   Jackson said one part of his message is the need to rid oursociety of drugs, a message that brings an enthusiastic responsewherever he goes.   The other, he said, is that a ``growing body of American workingpeople feel abandoned by the law'' and are turning to him becausehe addresses their concerns.   Jackson made the comments in an interview Thursday aboard hiscampaign plane flying here. He declined to predict how well he willdo in Tuesday's critical primaries. But he expressed cautiousoptimism that his ``economic justice'' theme is reaching whites aswell as his traditional base of black support.   ``One can never be...certain what's going to happen Tuesdaynight,'' he said, but added: ``My sense is there's a higher comfortlevel,'' among whites about his candidacy.   Asked about exit polls following February's Iowa caucuses andNew Hampshire primary that showed his white supporters were mostlyupscale and well-educated rather than the working class he isappealing to, Jackson said:   ``That is changing. Iowa led the breakthrough. People werewrestling with an ancient cultural barrier.''   By the time Maine held its Democratic caucuses last weekend,Jackson contended, the working class had become a main force behindhis second-place finish.   Drugs, he tells his audiences, are the No. 1 ``national securitythreat'' against the United States today. People respond to that,he said, because ``every parent knows their child is threatenedevery day by drugs ...People see this as a moral issue of our day.''   As president, Jackson says his priorty would be to beef up theCustoms and Border Patrol interdiction efforts, pressdrug-producing nations to develop other crops, and crack down oncorruption in law enforcement agencies and banks that work with thedrug traffickers.   The Democratic candidate is criss-crossing the South, touchingdown at five states per day for rallies at schools, churches, andauditoriums to shore up his widespread black support and woo newwhite voters.   On Thursday, Jackson held events in Arkansas, Oklahoma,Mississippi, but had to cancel a trip to New Orleans because of atornado watch that grounded his plane. Instead he spoke bytelephone to a church full of people who were waiting for him.   The campaign is filled with made-for-TV events to augment the$100,000 TV ad campaign that begins today in several southernstates.   Casual conversations with voters along the campaign trail revealsome sentiment that white voters are more willing to supportJackson than they were in 1984. Several said the race issue is farless of a concern.   ``Jackson represents something we've needed a long time,'' saidThomas DeLong, a 57-year-old white man who came to hear JacksonThursday at Mississippi State University.   ``The majority of people in this country are not wealthy,they're not yuppies, they're poor. And they can't get up becausethe system won't let them,'' he said.   Jackson said he senses the difference between this campaign andhis unsuccessful White House bid in 1984 because ``black and whiteinterests are coming together'' and the racial factors have beenovertaken by economic concerns.   Jackson cited this week's endorsements of his campaign byprominent white politicians _ Texas Agriculture Commissioner JimHightower, Oklahoma state Sen. Gene Stipe, and Tennessee Democraticactivist John J. Hooker _ as evidence of an expanding base.   ``Historical movements in this country have always been kind ofrace-based. This is becoming a class-based movement for economicjustice,'' he said in the interview.   He accused Southern Democratic leaders _ many of whom have linedup behind the other Southern native son, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee _ of a ``sustained effort'' to try and keep Democratsfrom his campaign.   ``All these elected officials are trying to stop me,'' he said.   But Stipe said that ``regardless of what the power brokers say,they cannot stop that momentum'' that Jackson is building.   Hooker said that in 1984, many whites who would not acceptJackson are taking a new look after he garnered substantial whitetotals in the early primary and caucus states.   Regardless of how the convention turns out this summer, Jacksonsaid he will work with the party leaders and push for the partyplatform to include planks addressing his priorities on raising theminimum wage and other concerns of working people.   He will also seek foreign policy planks on renewing trade withNicaragua and working with banks to relieve Latin countries' debtsso those nations can afford to buy more U.S. goods, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
