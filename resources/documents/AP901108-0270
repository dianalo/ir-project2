After the market closed, however, traders said they may haveoverestimated the gravity of Bush's move.   Crude oil dropped about $1 per barrel in early trading, butfinished the day with a 22 cent gain, closing at $35.53 per barrelfor December delivery contracts on the New York MercantileExchange.   Bush told Washington reporters he was building up the U.S.military force in the Persian Gulf to provide for ``an adequateoffensive option'' that could drive Iraq from Kuwait.   Administration officials had previously indicated they wouldsend more troops. Some traders said Thursday evening they hadperhaps overreacted to their nervousness over what Bush would say.   ``I didn't hear anything new,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``I think that the market definitelypushed itself higher than (it would have on) what we know now.''   Analysts said the market got scared in the afternoon whentraders learned a White House news conference on foreign policy,originally scheduled to take place during the trading session, hadbeen delayed until after the exchange would be closed. Tensionbuilt as traders learned the news conference was again delayeduntil after the stock market's closing bell.   Oil prices probably would have stayed lower for the day if Bushhad made his statements while trading was still going on, analystssaid.   The sharp rally had been driven in part by a rumor, said to havefloated in from the bond market, that Bush had been prepared toannounce plans to airlift supplies into the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,where diplomats have been surviving for weeks on scanty provisions.Traders believed such a scenario could provide the confrontationthat would trigger war in the Persian Gulf.   Others put no faith in the rumor, saying it had cropped upbefore.   ``This is the second time I've heard it in a week,'' said traderEd Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's like the `Saddamhas been shot' rumors.''   Some tense traders also believed Bush would give Iraq a deadlinefor getting out of Kuwait, which Bush did not do.   Oil prices also strengthened partly on news that the SovietUnion was refusing to rule out the use of force against Iraq, whichhas for years had close ties to Moscow.   Other energy futures moved higher as traders waited on Bush, butfor the day they finished mixed.   Home heating oil prices moved higher, with December deliverycontracts rising 1.59 cents to 94.30 cents a gallon and all latercontract months closing higher. Unleaded gasoline fell .68 cent to90.51 on December delivery contracts, but later contract monthswere all higher.   Natural gas prices were either down or unchanged for the day.December delivery contracts dropped 1.5 cents to $2.435 per 1,000cubic feet.</TEXT></DOC>
