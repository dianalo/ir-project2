This study was performed to show thequantitative potential of the error, using a mathematical model. Themathematical model combines the material balance equation (MBE) for apartial water-drive gas reservoir and the VEHE. The model generates pressure-productiondata for a conceptual partial water-drive gas reservoir, and for thefollowing two cases: Case A, using average reservoir pressures in theVEHE; and Case B, using pressures at the original GWC elevation in theVEHE. The error is defined as the difference in the calculated pressureperformances between cases A and B. This paper presents the procedureused to correct average gas reservoir pressure to the original gas/watercontact (GWC) elevation.</TEXT></DOC>
