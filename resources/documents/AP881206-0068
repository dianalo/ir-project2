SEARLES</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public Service Co. of Colorado says it plans to endnuclear operations by June 30, 1990, at its problem-ridden Fort St.Vrain power plant, the nation's only helium-cooled nuclear reactor.   A decision on whether to convert the plant to burn fossil fuelwill be made before the end of 1989, utility spokesman Mark Sievertssaid Monday.   The utility earlier announced that if it could not findthird-party assistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclearfacility, it would cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992. Theplant is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operatethrough 2008.   Sieverts said decommissioning the plant could take up to 55 years.   Fort St. Vrain employs a helium-cooled reactor found in Francebut not elsewhere in the United States. The plant began providingelectricity in 1976.   The 330-megawatt plant 35 miles northeast of Denver never wasallowed by the NRC to operate for any length of time at 100 percentof capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns.   A spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to a 22-month shutdown.In July 1986, NRC Commissioner James Asselstine told a congressionalsubcommittee that Fort St. Vrain was one of the 10 worst-run nuclearpower plants in the nation.   In 1986, the utility's executives ordered a $101 millionwritedown of the facility, and in October 1987 a fire in its turbinebuilding caused millions of dollars worth of damage.   The plant has been shut since July for scheduled repairs. It isexpected to resume electricity generation in January.   The utility said earlier it had three options for Fort St.Vrain's future: Shut it and remove everything of use; convert it toa coal- or gas-fired plant; or find a third party to take over theplant. Sieverts said the company is now left with the first twooptions.</TEXT></DOC>
