The appeals court in Denver, in a ruling in March, rejected rules that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had adopted in interpreting part of the 1978 federal natural gas law.    The FERC, the New York State Public Service Commission, and the Interstate Natural Gas Association, a trade group for gas pipelines, told the Supreme Court that the cost of the appeals court's approach from 1985, when the FERC rules took effect, through 1987 would be $300 million. The pipeline group said the costs would be passed on to natural gas consumers.    In 1984, FERC issued regulations for the pricing of some natural gas which, for technical reasons under the 1978 law, could have been assigned status as either pricecontrolled or deregulated. FERC said such gas should be treated as if it is deregulated and should be sold at market prices.    But the appeals court said the 1978 law permits gas producers to choose the status that gives them the highest price, either regulated or deregulated.    Because the market price for natural gas is currently lower than the regulated price, many gas producers would opt for the regulated price allowed them by the appeals court decision, FERC officials argued.    The FERC regulations were challenged in the federal appeals court by Martin Exploration Management Co. and a long list of other natural gas producers, including units of Amoco Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Exxon Corp., W.R. Grace andamp; Co., Pennzoil Co., and Phillips Petroleum Co.    ---   Cable Rules   The high court also agreed to decide whether the Federal Communications Commission may pre-empt local governments from setting standards for the quality of cable television signals.    A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia ruled 2-1 in March that the FCC has the authority to pre-empt local signal-quality regulations.    The justices will hear an appeal by New York City and the National League of Cities. The appeal argues that under a 1984 federal law, local governments may set quality standards for cable signals that are more demanding than standards set by the FCC.    The FCC has set quality guidelines for cable channels that carry signals of television stations, and has ordered local cable regulators to refrain from setting more stringent standards.    For other types of cable channels that carry special cable programming, such as Cable News Network, or pay programming, such as Home Box Office, the FCC hasn't set quality guidelines but has barred local governments from setting their own standards. The appeals court, in its decision in March, ordered the FCC to consider setting guidelines for these other classes of cable channels, and that issue is still pending at the FCC. </TEXT></DOC>
