Robert Mihaly, whose start-up idea was selected from a field of nearly 600 entrants, will receive $10,000 in seed money and a consultation with Arthur Lipper, the editor of Venture magazine and one of the contest judges.    The contest was sponsored by Bill and Julie Brice to celebrate the 10th anniversary of I Can't Believe It's Yogurt, the frozen-yogurt chain they started while students at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.    Mr. Mihaly, an artist whose sculpted-glass tabletops are in the Smithsonian Institution's permanent collection, has designed and sold sand-blasted glass, stone and wood products in Greenville for two years. With his winnings, he plans to buy a used van so he can take his work directly to construction sites.    The contest was the subject of a recent article in this newspaper. </TEXT></DOC>
