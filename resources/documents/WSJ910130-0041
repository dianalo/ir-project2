Karr   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/30/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   CNF ABF</CO><IN>AIR FREIGHT (AIF)TRUCKING (TRK)</IN><GV>POSTAL SERVICE (POS)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service is sharply tighteningsecurity measures for letters and packages shipped onpassenger jets in an effort to deter potential terroristattacks.   The measures, which are being put into effect this week,are the toughest ever for domestic mail. For example,beginning today, all but the smallest packages will bediverted from passenger planes to all-cargo planes or totrucks or trains unless they can be screened to see ifthey're safe.</LP><TEXT>   The Postal Service also is suspending same-day,airport-to-airport express mail service and is admonishingpostal personnel &quot;to know your shipper,&quot; Postmaster GeneralAnthony Frank said in an interview.   &quot;There are a lot of ways to protect passengers, and wewant to use them all,&quot; he added.   The new Postal Service procedures will help toughen whatsecurity experts have long described as a weak point in theU.S. aviation security system. The presidential commissionthat investigated the December 1988 Lockerbie bombing calledsecurity for mail inadequate, and members of Congress haveurged the Postal Service and the Federal AviationAdministration to tighten security measures.   But the moves, while bolstering airline security, may slowmail delivery -- although the Postal Service staunchly deniesit. It isn't clear whether they would affect airlineschedules.   Moreover, if the nation's passenger airlines end up losingmail business to cargo carriers in the air and on the groundit would be another blow for an industry already hemorrhaginglosses because of weak demand and higher fuel costs.   Most airlines carry mail on many of their flights. Infiscal 1989, the Postal Service paid the airlines more than$1 billion to carry mail, according to the presidential panelon the Lockerbie disaster.   On the flip side, air-cargo and ground transportationcompanies could benefit by the new procedures.   Emery Worldwide, an air-freight subsidiary of ConsolidatedFreightways Inc., of Menlo Park, Calif., expects to pick upconsiderable package mail from passenger planes, saidspokesman James Allen. Emery currently carries all of thePostal Service's overnight express mail. He declined tocomment on the terms of the expanded contract.   Melissa May, a spokeswoman for Airborne Freight Corp.,Seattle, said the company's Airborne Express service doesn'texpect to gain any business from the security moves.   Industry analysts say that up to $400 million in businesscould be switched to all-cargo carriers such as Emery. Mr.Allen said the company is satisfied with its security system.   The Postal Service took the actions as &quot;simply aprecautionary step,&quot; according to officials. It's understoodthat the Postal Service wasn't responding to specific threatsagainst particular jetliners. The Postal Service briefed theAir Transport Association, which represents most majorairlines, at a closed-door meeting yesterday. The trade groupdeclined to comment on the procedures.   Mr. Frank, who declined to give details about the safetysteps, said that the agency has been &quot;working on securitymeasures in a number of scenarios for months,&quot; including onethat involved the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf. &quot;Wefeel that our primary obligation is, first, to airplanes withpassengers on them and, second, to our employees,&quot; he said.   The Postal Service has held several talks with the FAAabout the situation, but the measures being put into effectaren't being initiated by the FAA. The FAA already hasordered tightened security on mail being shipped into theU.S.   The airport-to-airport service was suspended, Mr. Franksaid, because it's the &quot;easiest&quot; for a terrorist to target.He said that it would be possible for someone to figure outwhich plane would carry a specific parcel.   Using that service, a postal customer could drop off aletter or package at an airport for delivery at the flight'sdestination city.   But the amount of that special-service volume is &quot;verysmall,&quot; an agency spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
