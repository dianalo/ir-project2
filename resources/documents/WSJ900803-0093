The sharp moves in Fund American securities are the latestin a series of suspicious jumps in the shares of U.S.takeover targets involving either foreign companies orforeign investors. The Securities and Exchange Commissionalready has charged a number of investors in connection withseveral other deals -- notably, Rorer Group Inc.'s purchaseby Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Contel Corp.'s merger accord withGTE Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC began an inquiry into the Fund American trading,though the agency wouldn't comment.   The apparent insider trading in Fund American indicatesthat despite three years of tough prosecutions of insidetrading and related crimes, U.S. regulators and lawenforcement officials haven't frightened away manyindividuals who abuse inside information to make tradingprofits.   &quot;Greed is as American as apple pie,&quot; said Bruce Baird,former chief of the securities and commodities fraud unit inthe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, who prosecuted majorinsider-trading cases. Mr. Baird is now an attorney at theWashington law firm of Covington andamp; Burling.   Allianz AG, Europe's largest insurance company, announceda $3.3 billion purchase of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. fromFund American. But trading in stock and options of FundAmerican suggests that some investors knew by Monday that atransaction was pending. Under terms of the agreenment, FundAmerican will buy back Fireman's non-insurance assets for$2.2 billion, making the net cost to Allianz of the insurancebusiness $1.1 billion.   On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, volume in September40 call options on Fund American stock began an explosiverise Monday. Trading in these calls surged from 41 contractsFriday to 415 Monday, 897 contracts Tuesday and 1,891Wednesday, according to CBOE records. The options give aholder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 sharesof Fund American at $40 each.   On Wednesday, $133,000 of September 40 calls werepurchased in two large blocks near the close of trading. Whenthe market opened yesterday, and the Allianz deal wasannounced, the value of the two blocks leaped-creating aninstant profit of $450,000.   &quot;There was above-average volume in an illiquid option,reflecting speculation that a takeover price would come above$42.50 in the next six weeks,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, chiefoptions strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. Yesterday, FundAmerican stock closed at $49.75, up $11.625.   Said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen andamp;Co., &quot;It certainly looks as if somebody knew or thought theyknew something was going to happen to the stock.&quot;   A CBOE spokesperson said the exchange has begun a routineinvestigation on recent trading in Fund American options.   Meanwhile, on the New York Stock Exchange, Fund American'sstock climbed $3.125 a share in the three days prior toyesterday's announcement. On Tuesday, the stock traded611,900 shares, and on Wednesday, 511,800 shares; volume onboth days was about four times Fund American's average dailyvolume of 138,000 shares. There was no significant newsreleased about the company during the three days prior to theannouncement.   A Big Board spokesman said the unusual price and volumeactivity has triggered a routine probe by the exchange.Typically, the Big Board determines within six weeks whetherthe trading warrants further investigation.   Fireman's Fund is only the latest in a series of recenttakeovers that have been marred by unusual, and possiblyillegal, trading patterns, according to regulators andtraders.   In January, the SEC charged several foreign firms andinvestors with insider trading in the securities of RorerGroup before an announcement that the drug company would beacquired by French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc. Thosetrades allegedly were done through Swiss banks.   Just two weeks ago, the agency again pressedinsider-trading charges, this time in connection with optionsand stock trading of Contel before the phone company'sannouncement of a $6.2 billion merger with GTE. Again, theSEC said the trades were made through Swiss accounts. The SECacted quickly to freeze accounts and charged &quot;an unknown&quot;group of investors with insider trading.   Around the same time, options traders at the AmericanStock Exchange noticed sharp moves in the price of Motel 6Limited Partnership options well before that companyannounced a plan to be acquired by France's Accor S.A. Butpublished reports about a rumored deal preceded thatannouncement, and no SEC charges have been brought.   Recent SEC enforcement actions spotlight frequent foreigninvolvement in alleged insider trading cases. &quot;Europeans justhaven't gotten the message that they may be subject to U.S.securities laws even though they maybe sitting in Switzerlandor Liechtenstein or someplace,&quot; said John Olson, a Washingtonsecurities lawyer. &quot;We don't see as many domestic peopleinvolved because I think the message is pretty well outhere,&quot; he said.   He and other lawyers said that in many foreign countries,investors don't necessarily think it is wrong to trade onconfidential information.   &quot;The sensitivity of foreigners to the nuances of ourmarket is still evolving,&quot; said Harvey Pitt, anotherWashington securities lawyer. &quot;It has only been in the lastfive or six years that most European countries have changedtheir views on insider trading&quot; to move closer to U.S.regulations.   Mr. Olson said he expects it will be several years beforethe SEC and other countries' enforcement organizations areable to start slowing the pace of insider trading. &quot;The realproblem is that it takes time to get that message across,&quot;Mr. Olson said. &quot;You just have to charge more crooks.&quot;   Illegal foreign trades in U.S. stocks are among thetoughest for the agency to prove, though. The SEC has beensuccessful at convincing courts to freeze the assets ofalleged wrongdoers before they can complete the sales ofsecurities and take the funds out. But after that, the agencyis forced to rely on agreements with foreign countries forcooperation to prosecute those individuals.</TEXT></DOC>
