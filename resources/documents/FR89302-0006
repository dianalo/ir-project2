Section 817(h) was added to the Code by section 211(a)of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 750). On September15, 1986, the <T4>Federal Register</T4> published amendments (T.D. 8101; 51 FR 32633)to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) to provide temporary regulationsunder section 817(h). The same issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> also published proposed amendments (51 FR 32664)to the Income Tax Regulations and the Table of OMB Control Numbers basedon those temporary regulations. This document supersedes the temporaryregulations under section 817(h) and adopts final regulations based onthe notice of proposed rulemaking published on September 15, 1986. Before adopting the final regulations, the Internal Revenue Service solicitedcomments and held a public hearing on the proposed amendments. Fourteenwritten comments responding to the notice of proposed rulemaking were received.In addition, seven persons provided oral comments at the hearing held onJuly 1, 1987. After consideration of all comments received, the proposedamendments are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>Several commentators argued that if a segregated asset account fails thediversification requirements, any contract invested in such account shouldfail to qualify as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract onlyfor the period during which the account was not adequately diversified.The Internal Revenue Service believes that, in general, failing the diversificationrequirements should result in disqualification of contracts for all periods.Section 817(h) provides that a variable contract shall not be treated asan annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for purposes of subchapterL, section 72, and section 7702(a) for any period (and any subsequent period)for which the investments made by a segregated asset account underlyingthe contract are not adequately diversified. The statutory language indicatesthat contracts should remain disqualified for periods subsequent to theperiod for which the investments are not adequately diversified. With respectto prior periods, section 7702 requires that, for a life insurance or endowmentcontract, any income on the contract for all prior taxable years be treatedas income received or accrued by the policyholder if the contract ceasesto meet the definition of a life insurance contract. An annuity contractis treated in the same manner under these regulations. Various commentators suggested that if a failure to diversify is inadvertentand the failure is promptly corrected, contracts based on such an accountshould continue to qualify as life insurance, endowment, or annuity contractsduring all periods. The Internal Revenue Service agrees that variable contractsbased upon a segregated asset account that inadvertently becomes nondiversifiedshould be treated as remaining qualified, provided that the issuer or holderof the contract agrees to pay such amounts as may be required by the Commissioner.The amounts required by the Commissioner to be paid will be based on theamount of tax the policyholders would have been required to pay if theywere treated as receiving the income on the contract during the periodof nondiversification. Although based on the amount of tax described inthe preceding sentence, it is anticipated that, in determining the amountof the payment, the absence of a policyholder basis adjustment and otherrelevant factors will be taken into account. Several commentators disagreed with the treatment in the proposed regulationsof all government securities as securities of a single issuer. This rulehas been revised to conform to section 817(h)(6), as added by section 6080of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. The proposed regulations provide that the members of an affiliated group,within the meaning of section 1504(a), ordinarily are treated as a singleissuer. The final regulations delete this provision. Various comments relating to the start-up period rules under paragraph(c)(2) of the proposed regulations were received. The proposed regulationsprovide that the start-up period rules apply only if no more than 30 percentof the amount allocated to a segregated asset account as of any date isattributable to premium and investment income received more than one yearprior to such date. A commentator suggested that amounts transferred froma previously diversified account and amounts transferred as a result ofa tax-free exchange of an unaffiliated company's contract do not constitutean abuse of the start-up period rules, even if such amounts were receivedmore than one year prior to the test date. In addition, the commentatornoted that it is burdensome for companies to trace premium and investmentincome as of any date. Accordingly, the final regulations provide thatif more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated asset accountas of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contracts enteredinto more than one year before such date, the start-up period rules donot apply. Any amount transferred to the account from a diversified accountor any amount transferred as a result of an exchange pursuant to section1035 with an unaffiliated company is not treated as an amount attributableto contracts entered into more than one year before such date.Several commentators requested clarification of the rules relating to theaggregation of multiple accounts or funds. The final regulations restatethese rules and provide additional clarifying examples.The final regulations extend the look-through rules applicable to underlyinginvestment companies or trusts all of the interests in which (with certainexceptions) are held by segregated asset accounts to underlying partnershipsall of the interests in which are held by such persons. The final regulationsclarify that this look-through rule is available to a segregated assetaccount (notwithstanding ownership of interests in the underlying entityby the public) if all the assets of the segregated asset account are attributableto (i) premium payments made by policyholders prior to September 26, 1981,(ii) premium payments made in connection with a qualified pension or retirementplan, or (iii) any combination of such premium payments. Additionally,the final regulations clarify that the return on an interest in an underlyingentity held by the general account of a life insurance company must becomputed in the same manner as the return for the related variable contractsprior to deducting expenses related to the variable contracts.The final regulations include an additional look-through rule for trusts,substantially all of the assets of which are Treasury securities. Underthis rule, Treasury securities are still treated as such, even though theyare held through a custodial arrangement that is treated as a grantor trust.Several commentators requested that the regulations clarify whether purchasedput and call options on Treasury securities, interest rate futures contractson Treasury securities, and options on such contracts are classified asTreasury securities under the regulations. The final regulations clarifythat such options and futures contracts are not Treasury securities becausetheir direct obligor is not the U.S. Treasury.The proposed regulations require that in order to qualify as a real propertyaccount, an account must have 40 percent of its assets invested in realproperty or interests in real property on the first anniversary of thedate premium income is first received. A commentator requested that thisperiod be increased to 18 months, because of the extensive time neededto identify and buy real property for investment. Accordingly, the finalregulations provide that, if on or before the first anniversary of theaccount, the issuer has stated an intention to invest the assets of theaccount primarily in real property or interests in real property, the accountwill be permitted 18 months to invest at least 40 percent of its assetsin such items.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this rule is nota major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis is not required. Although a notice of proposed rulemakingthat solicited public comment was issued, the Internal Revenue Serviceconcluded when the notice was issued that the regulations are interpretativeand that the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 didnot apply. Accordingly, the final regulations do not constitute regulationssubject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Sharon L.

For this purpose, a variablecontract shall be treated as based on a segregated asset account for acalendar quarter period if amounts received under the contract (or earningsthereon) are allocated to the segregated asset account at any time duringthe period. In addition, a variable contract that is not treated as anannuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period by reasonof this paragraph (a)(1) shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment,or life insurance contract for any subsequent period even if the investmentsare adequately diversified for such subsequent period. If a variable contractwhich is a life insurance or endowment contract under other applicable(e.g., State or foreign) law is not treated as a life insurance or endowmentcontract under section 7702(a), the income on the contract for any taxableyear of the policyholder is treated as ordinary income received or accruedby the policyholder shall be treated as ordinary income received or accruedby the policyholder during such year in accordance with section 7702 (g)and (h). Likewise, if a variable contract is not treated as an annuitycontract under section 72, the income on the contract for any taxable yearof the policyholder during such year in the same manner as a life insuranceor endowment contract under section 7702 (g) and (h).(2) <T3>Inadvertent failure to diversify. </T3>The investments of a segregatedasset account shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph(b) of this section for one or more periods, provided the following conditionsare satisfied_(i) The issuer or holder must show the Commissioner that the failure ofthe investments to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this sectionfor such period or periods was inadvertent,(ii) The investments of the account must satisfy the requirements of paragraph(b) of this section within a reasonable time after the discovery of suchfailure, and(iii) The issuer or holder of the variable contract must agree to makesuch adjustments or pay such amounts as may be required by the Commissionerwith respect to the period or periods during which the investments of theaccount did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.The amount required by the Commissioner to be paid shall be an amount basedupon the tax that would have been owed by the policyholders if they weretreated as receiving the income on the contract (as defined in section7702(g)(1)(B), without regard to section 7702(g)(1)(C)) for such periodor periods.(b) <T3>Diversification of investments</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>(i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraphand paragraph (c) of this section, the investments of a segregated assetaccount shall be considered adequately diversified for purposes of thissection and section 817(h) only if_(A) No more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the account isrepresented by any one investment;(B) No more than 70% of the value of the total assets of the account isrepresented by any two investments;(C) No more than 80% of the value of the total assets of the account isrepresented by any three investments; and(D) No more than 90% of the value of the total assets of the account isrepresented by any four investments.(ii) For purposes of this section_(A) All securities of the same issuer, all interests in the same real propertyproject, and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as asingle investment; and(B) In the case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentalityshall be treated as a separate issuer.(iii) See paragraph (f) of this section for circumstances in which a segregatedasset account is treated as the owner of assets held indirectly throughcertain pass-through entities and corporations taxed under subchapter M,chapter 1 of the Code.(2) <T3>Safe harbor. </T3>A segregated asset account will be considered adequatelydiversified for purposes of this section and section 817(h) if_ (i) The account meets the requirements of section 851 (b)(4) and the regulationsthereunder; and (ii) No more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the account isattributable to cash, cash items (including receivables), government securities,and securities of other regulated investment companies. (3) <T3>Alternative diversification requirements for variable life insurancecontracts. </T3>(i) A segregated asset account with respect to variablelife insurance contracts will be considered adequately diversified forpurposes of this section and section 817(h) if the requirements of paragraph(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section are satisfied of if the assets of suchaccount, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the percentage limitationsprescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section increased by the Productof (A) .5 and (B) the percentage of the value of the total assets of theaccount that is represented by Treasury securities. In determining whetherthe assets of an account, other than Treasury securities, satisfy the increasedpercentage limitations, such limitations are applied as if the Treasurysecurities were not included in the account (<T3>i.e., </T3>the increased percentage limitations are not applied toTreasury securities and the value of the total assets of the account isreduced by the value of the Treasury securities). (ii) The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) may be illustrated by thefollowing examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year,a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contractsholds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the accountare represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $90,000and securities of Corporation A having a total value of $10,000. The 55%limit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increasedby 45% (0.5andmultiply;90%) to 100%, and would then be applied to the assetsof the account other than Treasury securities. Because no more than 100%of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities is representedby securities of Corporation A, the investments of the account will beconsidered adequately diversified. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>On the last day of a quarter of a calendar year,a segregated asset account with respect to variable life insurance contractsholds assets having a total value of $100,000. The assets of the accountare represented by Treasury securities having a total value of $60,000,securities of Corporation A having a total value of $30,000, and securitiesof Corporation B having a total value of $10,000. The 55% and 70% limitsdescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be increased by30% (0.5andmultiply;60%) to 85% and 100%, respectively, and would then beapplied to the assets of the account other than Treasury securities. Securitiesof Corporation A represent 75%, and securities of Corporation B represent25%, of the value of the assets of the account other than Treasury securities.Because no more than 85% of the value of the assets other than Treasurysecurities is represented by securities of Corporation A or B and no morethan 100% of the value of the assets other than Treasury securities isrepresented by securities of Corporations A and B, the investments of theaccount will be considered adequately diversified.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Periods for which an account is adequately diversified_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>A segregated asset account that satisfies the requirementsof paragraph (b) of this section on the last day of a quarter of a calendaryear (<T3>i.e., </T3>March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31) or within30 days after such last day shall be considered adequately diversifiedfor such quarter. (2) <T3>Start-up period. </T3>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)of this section, a segregated asset account that is not a real propertyaccount on its first anniversary shall be considered adequately diversifieduntil such first anniversary. (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, a segregatedasset account that is a real property account on its first anniversaryshall be considered adequately diversified until the earlier of its fifthanniversary or the anniversary on which the account ceases to be a realproperty account. (iii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, theanniversary of a segregated asset account is the anniversary of the dateon which any amount received under a life insurance or annuity contract,other than a pension plan contract (as defined in section 818 (a)), isfirst allocated to the account. (iv) If more than 30 percent of the amount allocated to a segregated assetaccount as of the last day of a calendar quarter is attributable to contractsentered into more than one year before such date, paragraph (c)(2)(i) ofthis section shall not apply to the segregated asset account for any periodafter such date. Similarly, if more than 30 percent of the amount allocatedto a segregated asset account as of the last day of a calendar quarteris attributable to contracts entered into more than 5 years before suchdate, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall not apply to the segregatedasset account for any period after such date. For purposes of this paragraph(c)(2), amounts transferred to the account from a diversified account (determinedwithout regard to this paragraph (c)(2)) or as a result of an exchangepursuant to section 1035 in which the issuer of the contract received inthe exchange is not related in a manner specified in section 267(b) tothe issuer of the contract transferred in the exchange are not treatedas_ (A) Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than one year beforesuch date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of thissection, or (B) Amounts attributable to contracts entered into more than five yearsbefore such date, in the case of accounts subject to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)of this section. (3) <T3>Liquidation period. </T3>A segregated asset account that satisfiesthe requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on the date a plan ofliquidation is adopted shall be considered adequately diversified for_(i) The one-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidation isadopted if the account is not a real property account on such date; or(ii) The two-year period beginning on the date the plan of liquidationis adopted if the account is a real property account on such date. (d) <T3>Market fluctuations. </T3>A segregated asset account that satisfiesthe requirements of paragraph (b) of this section at the end of any calendarquarter (or within 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter) shallnot be considered nondiversified in a subsequent quarter because of a discrepancybetween the value of its assets and the diversification requirements unlesssuch discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any assetand such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition.(e) <T3>Segregated asset account. </T3>For purposes of section 817(h) and thissection, a segregated asset account shall consist of all assets the investmentreturn and market value of each of which must be allocated in an identicalmanner to any variable contract invested in any of such assets. See paragraph(g) for examples illustrating the application of this paragraph (e).  (f) <T3>Look-through rule for assets held through certain investment companies,partnerships, or trusts</T3>_(1)<T3> In general. </T3>If this paragraph (f) applies, a beneficial interestin a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, a partnership,or a trust that is treated under sections 671 through 679 as owned by thegrantor or another person (``investment company, partnership, or trust'')shall not be treated as a single investment of a segregated asset account.Instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment company, partnership,or trust shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as an asset ofthe segregated asset account. For purposes of this section, the ratableinterest of a partner in a partnership's assets shall be determined inaccordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.(2) <T3>Applicability_</T3>(i) <T3>Certain investment companies, partnerships, and trusts. </T3>This paragraph(f) shall apply to an investment company, partnership, or trust if_(A) All the beneficial interests in the investment company, partnership,or trust (other than those described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section)are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurancecompanies; and(B) Public access to such investment company, partnership, or trust isavailable exclusively (except as otherwise permitted in paragraph (f)(3)of this section) through the purchase of a variable contract. Solely forthis purpose, the status of a contract as a variable contract will be determinedwithout regard to section 817(h) and this section.(ii) <T3>Nonregistered partnerships. </T3>This paragraph (f) shall also applyto a partnership interest if the partnership interest is not registeredunder a Federal or State law regulating the offering or sale of securities.(iii) <T3>Trusts holding Treasury securities. </T3>This paragraph (f) shall alsoapply to a trust that is treated under section 671 through 679 as ownedby the grantor or another person if substantially all of the assets ofthe trust are represented by Treasury securities.(3) <T3>Interests not held by segregated asset accounts.</T3> Satisfactionof the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall not beprevented by reason of beneficial interests in the investment company,partnership, or trust that are_(i) Held by the general account of a life insurance company or a corporationrelated in a manner specified in section 267(b) to a life insurance company,but only if the return on such interests is computed in the same manneras the return on an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed(determined without regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts),there is no intent to sell such interests to the public, and a segregatedasset account of such life insurance company also holds or will hold abeneficial interest in the investment company, partnership, or trust;(ii) Held by the manager, or a corporation related in a manner specifiedin section 267(b) to the manager, of the investment company, partnership,or trust, but only if the holding of the interests is in connection withthe creation or management of the investment company, partnership, or trust,the return on such interest is computed in the same manner as the returnon an interest held by a segregated asset account is computed (determinedwithout regard to expenses attributable to variable contracts), and thereis no intent to sell such interests to the public;(iii) Held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan; or(iv) Held by the public, or treated as owned by policyholders pursuantto Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12, but only if (A) the investment company,partnership, or trust was closed to the public in accordance with Rev.Rul. 82-55, 1982-1 C.B. 12, or (B) all the assets of the segregated assetaccount are attributable to premium payments made by policyholders priorto September 26, 1981, to premium payments made in connection with a qualifiedpension or retirement plan, or to any combination of such premium payments.(g) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this sectionmay be illustrated by the following examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>(i) The assets underlying variable contracts issuedby a life insurance company consist of two groups of assets: (a) a diversifiedportfolio of debt securities and (b) interests in P, a partnership thatis publicly registered. All of the beneficial interests in P are held byone or more segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companiesand public access to P is available exclusively through the purchase ofa variable contract. The variable contracts provide that policyholdersmay specify which portion of each premium is to be invested in the debtsecurities and which portion is to be invested in P interests. The portfolioof debt securities and the assets of P, considered separately, each satisfythe diversification requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) As a result of the ability of policyholders to allocate premiumsamong the two groups of assets, the investment return and market valueof the interests in P and the debt securities may be allocated to differentvariable contracts in a non-identical manner. Accordingly, under paragraph(e) of this section, the interests in P are treated as part of a singlesegregated asset account (``Account 1'') and the debt securities are treatedas part of a different segregated asset account (``Account 2'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Since P is described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section,interests in P will not be treated as a single investment of Account 1.Rather, Account 1 is treated as owning a pro rata portion of the assetsof P.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Since Account 1 and Account 2 each satisfy the requirements ofparagraph (b) of this section, variable contracts that are based on eitheror both accounts are treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> The facts are the same as in example (1) except thatsome of the beneficial interests in P are held by persons not describedin paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Since P is not described in paragraph(f)(2) of this section, interests in P will be treated as a single investmentof Account 1. As a result, Account 1 does not satisfy the requirementsof paragraph (b) of this section. Variable contracts based in whole orin part on Account 1 are not treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurancecontracts. Variable contracts that are not based on Account 1 at any timeduring the period in which such account fails to satisfy the requirementsof paragraph (b) of this section (<T3>i.e.,</T3> contracts based entirely on Account 2), are treated as annuity,endowment, or life insurance contracts. See paragraph (a)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> The facts are the same as in example (2) except thatP is not publicly registered. Since P is described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)of this section, the result is the same as in example (1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4).</T3> The facts are the same as in example (2) except thatthe variable contracts do not permit policyholders to allocate premiumsbetween or among the debt securities and interests in P. Thus, the investmentreturn and market value of the interests in P and the debt securities mustbe allocated to the same variable contracts and in an identical manner.Under paragraph (e) of this section, the interests in P and the debt securitiesare treated as part of a single segregated asset account. If the interestsin P and the debt securities, considered together, satisfy the requirementsof paragraph (b) of this section, contracts based on this segregated assetaccount will be treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.</ITAG>(h) <T3>Definitions.</T3> The terms defined below shall, for purposes of thissection, have the meanings set forth in such definitions:(1) <T3>Government security</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> The term ``government security'' shall mean anysecurity issued or guaranteed or insured by the United States or an instrumentalityof the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing.Any security or certificate or deposit insured or guaranteed only in partby the United States or an instrumentality thereof is treated as issuedby the United States or its instrumentality only to the extent so insuredor guaranteed, and as issued by the direct obligor to the extent not soinsured or guaranteed. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), an instrumentalityof the United States shall mean any person that is treated for purposesof 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 (16), as amended, as a person controlled or supervisedby and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United Statespursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States.(ii) <T3>Example.</T3> A segregated asset account purchases a certificate ofdeposit in the amount of $150,000 from bank A. Deposits in bank A are insuredby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an instrumentality of theUnited States, to the extent of $100,000 per depositor.
