Garcia's reputation is in tatters, and the country's fragiledemocracy appears increasingly vulnerable to a military coup.   Since Garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in Peru'shistory in early September, some critics have gone so far as todemand his resignation, and he reportedly has considered steppingdown. More ominously, many public figures are warning of the growingdanger of a military takeover.   Cesar Hilderbrandt, editor of the independent news magazine Si,wrote in a recently published open letter to Garcia: ``You know,just as other officials of your government do, that a coup d'etat isinevitable if the political and economic climate of today continuesto devastate the country,''   Peru's armed forces seized power in 1968 and ruled until 1980.They returned to the barracks under heavy public accusations thattheir leftist policies brought on economic mismanagement.   The 39-year-old Garcia's approval rating among Peru's 21 millionpeople has plunged from an incredible 96 percent during his firstmonths in office to 16 percent in late October, according to therespected polling firm Apoyo.   When he took over, the 6-foot-3 Garcia, leader of the populistAprista Party, was called ``the president of hope'' by hisfollowers, most of them impoverished mountain peasants orinhabitants of Lima's sprawling shantytowns.   Nowadays he is accused of being a demagogue, of implementingimpetuous, irresponsible policies that have brought economic ruin tothe nation, and of failing to curtail the Shining Path movement,whose eight-year guerrilla war has claimed more than 12,000 lives.   Mario Vargas Llosa, the renowned novelist who is expected to bethe presidential candidate of a center-right coalition in the 1990election, recently described Garcia as ``the charismatic young manresponsible for Peru's most incompetent and ruinous government ofthe century.''   What has Peruvians most upset is the country's unprecedentedrunaway inflation, provoked, economists agree, by the government'suncontrolled spending, which has spawned a huge fiscal deficitequivalent to 16 percent of the gross domestic product.   Consumer prices soared by 114 percent in September, as much inone month as all of last year. Inflation is expected to exceed 1,000percent by year end.   Having eaten up the country's hard currency reserves to finance aconsumer-hinged economic recovery program and having cut itself offfrom fresh foreign loans, the government is close to bankruptcy. Ithas had to resort to selling the Central Bank's gold bullion to payimport bills, but now that is gone.   Finance Minister Abel Salinas said recently the economy wouldshrink by at least 6 percent this year after growing 8.5 percent in1986 and 7.0 percent in 1987.   The harsh austerity measures, which included increases in foodprices of more than 200 percent and a devaluation of nearly 90percent, brought economic activity to a halt.   Only four new cars were sold in the country in September becauseof tax increases that doubled car prices, with the least expensiveVolkswagen model now costing $26,000. Beer sales were down 90percent from August.   From early September until mid October, Garcia did not leave theinner confines of the Government Palace for 34 straight days, excepton one occasion to watch the changing of the guards from the frontentrance. That single, fleeting appearance was interpreted bycommentators as a gesture to dispel rumors he was no longer incharge of the government.   Garcia was reported to have tried to present his resignation tohis Cabinet before the unpopular austerity package was imposed andto have offered the job to Luis Alberto Sanchez, his 88-year-old,blind vice president. Sanchez said later that he told Garcia, ``Iwas elected vice president to collaborate with you, not to take yourplace.''   Political analysts say Garcia's recent behavior has given theimpression of a dangerous power vacuum that feeds the fears of amilitary takeover.   ``Even the least informed citizen knows, or senses, that therecannot be a power vacuum in politics. He also knows that in Perupower vacuums are always filled by the military,'' Manueld'Ornellas, editor of the opposition newspaper Expreso, wrote in arecent column.   A senior government official told The Associated Press that themilitary high command did, in fact, meet to consider overthrowingGarcia during his self-imposed confinement to the palace.   ``The president was passing through a period of depression thatworried the military,'' the official said, speaking on condition henot be identified.   Having suffered in the past under long spells of military rule,Peru's political leaders have been outspoken in demanding that thearmed forces not be provoked into seizing power again.   ``Nothing would be more tragic for Peru than a military coup,''writer Vargas Llosa said. ``Peru's isolation from the internationalcommunity would be aggravated even further.''</TEXT></DOC>
