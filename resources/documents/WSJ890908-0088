The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a permanent ban against smoking on all domestic flights, regardless of their length. The ban would significantly expand the current law that prohibits smoking on flights of less than two hours' duration.    The measure has the private support of the airlines, which are happy to see smoking banished -- but eager to avoid offending their cigarette-smoking passengers.    By an 18-11 roll-call vote, tobacco interests lost in their bid to block the new language. The industry is increasingly isolated in the face of steady pressure in Congress to expand the temporary restrictions first voted two years ago.    The measure would take effect 90 days after enactment, eliminating one of the few remaining sanctuaries for hassle-free smoking.    The Senate committee took the action as part of a transportation-spending bill allocating nearly $26.5 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The House, as part of the same transportation bill, has already voted to ban smoking permanently on flights of two hours or less.    The language would extend this prohibition to the 20% of domestic flights that aren't currently covered by the no-smoking rule. The same long-distance traffic accounts for a larger share -- more than a third -- of total airline passengers, and tobacco allies had hoped to draw the line at two hours.    &quot;I take it I'm talking to a fixed jury,&quot; complained Sen. Ernest Hollings. Although the South Carolina Democrat commands broad power as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he was matched against a popular issue and opponent, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who heads the transportation subcommittee distributing funds to favored projects for appropriation members.    &quot;Two hours is not enough, ask the American people,&quot; said the New Jersey Democrat. &quot;Separating the seating doesn't separate the air we breath.&quot;    Industry opponents to the ban appear uncertain as to what strategy to pursue on the Senate floor. But their best hope may be to force delays in hopes of putting pressure on Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd. The West Virginia Democrat voted with Mr. Lautenberg yesterday but is determined to move expeditiously on fiscal 1990 bills and may have little stomach for a prolonged debate.    Mr. Lautenberg has invested heavily in the issue, and though his persistence has annoyed some senior Democrats, he has the advantage of a measure that has clear bipartisan support. The Bush administration hasn't raised any opposition.    Both foreign and U.S. carriers would be covered by the adopted smoking provision, which would apply to flights that begin or end in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
