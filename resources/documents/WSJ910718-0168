New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner Mark Greencharged Gillette Co., Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Revlon Inc. andS.C. Johnson andamp; Son Inc. with violating the city's consumerprotection law by making false claims about the environmentalbenefits of their aerosol products. The products includeGillette's Right Guard deodorant, S.C. Johnson's Glade airfreshener, Procter andamp; Gamble's Sure and Secret anti-perspirantand Revlon's Flex hairspray. The companies have been orderedby the city's consumer affairs department to negotiatesettlements of the charges or face civil lawsuits.                                                                                                          Mr. Green, who is known for aggressively challengingquestionable green advertising, charged that the aerosolproducts release hydrocarbons contributing to ground-levelozone. Ozone, one of the main constituents of smog, is ahighly reactive form of oxygen that can trigger asthmaattacks and may cause long-term lung damage in people livingin smoggy places. Concern is growing about hydrocarbonreleases from consumer products, and California has becomethe first state to establish rules limiting emissions fromthese products.   Mr. Green also lashed out at claims that aerosol productsdon't harm the atmosphere because they contain nochlorofluorocarbons. CFCs, which contribute to the thinningof the earth's stratospheric layer of ozone that blocks solarultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer, were banned fromaerosols by Congress in 1978. Thus, charged Mr. Green, theozonefriendly claims on aerosols &quot;are a smokescreen meant toobscure the harmful, smog-producing effects of these sprays.&quot;   The New York action was announced as part of testimony byMr. Green at a Federal Trade Commission hearing inWashington, D.C., on misleading green marketing claims. Suchclaims also recently have come under scrutiny by a group ofstate attorneys general, and are the subject of a billrecently introduced in Congress to give the EnvironmentalProtection Agency authority to set technical ground rules forgreen advertising.   In Boston, a Gillette spokesman said, &quot;we disagreecompletely&quot; with Mr. Green's allegations. He added that thecompany has used the label claim &quot;Ozone Friendly/No CFCs&quot; onaerosol products &quot;because of heightened attention to theozone layer and because we felt consumers were confusingCFC-based products with hydrocarbon-based products. We don'tbelieve the (label claim) is misleading in any way.&quot;   Last fall, however, Gillette began a change in the aerosolproduct claim to &quot;Contains no CFCs&quot; due to controversy aboutthe previous label wording, the spokesman said. About 75% ofGillette's aerosol products are expected to carry the newlabel by the end of the year, he added.   In Racine, Wis., an S.C. Johnson spokeswoman said &quot;ourlabel claims reflect a conscientious effort to begin tocorrect&quot; what researchers have found to be &quot;numerous publicmisperceptions about the environmental impact&quot; of certainconsumer products.   She said Johnson considers the notice of violation fromNew York's consumer affairs department &quot;an unfortunate resultof the numerous and often conflicting interpretations ofenvironmentally related labeling&quot; by officials at state,local and national levels.   &quot;We support the adoption of appropriate uniformenvironmental-labelling standards,&quot; she said.   In Cincinnati, a Pandamp;G spokesman said its Secret and Surelabels are &quot;absolutely true.&quot; The company put the &quot;no CFCs&quot;statement on the products because &quot;a large number ofconsumers told us they want to know whether these productscontain CFCs,&quot; he said.   Pandamp;G officials plan to meet with New York City officials toresolve the issue, he said.   New York-based Revlon could not be immediately reached forcomment.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
