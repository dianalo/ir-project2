The Securities and Exchange Commission said 12b-1 fees, which are used to pay marketing expenses, must be listed as line-item expenses in shareholder reports and other documents. Some funds have been taking a less direct approach by footnoting the fees as charges against capital.    Although both treatments affect investment companies' bottom lines the same way, &quot;charging things to capital is a non-disclosure tactic. It's obfuscatory,&quot; says Robert Willens, a partner with Peat Marwick, the accounting firm.    The SEC's rule amendment isn't related to an ongoing broad review of uses and disclosure concerning the controversial 12b-1 fees. Since first allowed in 1980 to help small funds defray marketing expenses, 12b-1 fees have proliferated and are now commonplace among mutual funds using a variety of complex plans. Regulators have raised questions about clear disclosure, fee plan structures and types of shareholder and director approvals.    The SEC review, begun last year, is going &quot;slower than we'd like,&quot; says Kathryn McGrath, head of the SEC division that oversees mutual funds. </TEXT></DOC>
