It was translated from Arabic by The AssociatedPress.   In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate,   To the free men of the world,   To the American people,   To the families of the hostages,   Day after day the American administration is cheating, lying andmisleading the American people and the families of the hostages tohead off any pressure on the American government to embark uponrealistic steps to resolve the question of the hostages in order topreserve their (government leaders') posts, privileges and personalinterests. After the American comment by Reagan and Bush about thecontents of the videotape recorded by Terry Anderson, we wish toclarify the following:   1. The videotape, irrespective of its contents, has been issueddirectly by Terry Anderson without any pressure. It was made inresponse to the written and photographed messages which were sent tohim through news agencies. The tape was made after sharp exchangesbetween him and us about all the ideas he introduced, which weconsidered very lacking. Anderson will make an adequate answer tothese (Reagan's) claims.   2. America is constantly evading the contents of the videotapeand the messages, which form an irrefutable and incontestablereality, by casting direct doubts about the tape's contents and byclaiming it was issued by the kidnappers.   3. The hostages we hold are not isolated from the outside world.They see and hear the news in newspapers, magazines and televisionstations and are aware of everything that happened or will happenabout their situation. What Reagan has said in this regard is likethe ostrich that hides her head in the sand so that the hunter willnot see her.   4. The U.S. administration, represented by its president, hisvice president, staff and aides carried out all the deals concerningthe hostages. Otherwise who negotiated in the TWA hijack and whywere the 40 passengers and 735 prisoners in Israeli jails freed? Whoalso negotiated in the Iran-Contra affair? Who gave the weapons andtook the money and funneled it to the contras? It is strange thatReagan has lately declared that he does not know so far who offeredthe arms and the origin of the money in the Irangate. Isn't it theAmerican administration? Or are they at a cattle ranch with eachseeking his own ends? If they really knew, that will be anundeniable calamity, and if they didn't, that will be an evengreater catastrophy.   5. It has also been said that the cease-fire in the gulf willspeed up the release of the captives with us. We repeat for athousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not inany way linked to what happens in the gulf. The hope that prevailedin the past has gone forever. Failure to free the hostages is aresult of the American heresy, procrastination and reneging onpledges and promises.   The only safe way to the freedom of the captives and their safetyis the implementation of our just demands. This is the essentialcornerstone in this issue, nothing else.
