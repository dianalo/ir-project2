Khomeini's overtures to the Soviet Union, which he previouslycondemned for its atheist ideology, came during a 1{-hour meetingwith Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.   Sheverdnadze later met Prime Minister Hussein Musavi anddelivered an invitation for him to visit Moscow, according to Iran'sofficial Islamic Republic News Agency.   IRNA said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his orderfor Moslem zealots to assassinate British author Salman Rushdiebecause of his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Britain reportedly askedShevardnadze to press Khomeini to give a reprieve to Rushdie, whosebook has been denounced as insulting to Islam.   ``There was no mention of the affair in Shevardnadze's speech,''said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.   The meeting with Shevardnadze came two days after Khomeinideclared Iran does not need relations with the West. This issue hasdivided the Tehran hierarchy between so-called pragmatists, whofavor more relations with the rest of the world, and hardliners, whofavor continued isolation.   However, Iran's Cabinet declared Sunday it is united behindKhomeini, reported Tehran Television, which also was monitored inNicosia.   ``Your children are united as a single hand against the enemiesof Islam,'' it quoted a Cabinet statement as saying of theinternational furor over Rushdie.   The award-winning author born into a Moslem family in India hasbeen in hiding since Khomeini's Feb. 14 execution order, and Iranianreligious leaders put a $5.2 million bounty on his head.   In protest, Britain withdrew all its diplomats from its embassyin Tehran, which had been reopened in December after an earlier riftof more than a year. It also asked Iranian diplomats to leave London.   The 11 other European Community countries as well as Norway,Sweden and Canada, recalled their top diplomats from Iran, andTehran brought its ambassadors home.   No diplomatic ties have been formally broken. But religiousleaders in Tehran last week called for a break with Britain.   IRNA said more than 100 of the 270 deputies in Iran's Parliamentsponsored a bill Sunday to put relations with Britain to the vote.The bill was ``passed overwhelmingly,'' making it a priority at thenext parliamentary session Tuesday, IRNA said.   Rushdie has apologized for the distress ``The Satanic Verses''has caused, saying his work was intended to study good and evil froma secular viewpoint and not intended to insult anyone.   Many Moslems contend the novel insults Islam by portraying theprophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting Mohammedwrote the Koran, Islam's holy book, rather than receiving itdirectly from God.   The English-language Tehran Times said Sunday that hostilerelations with the West stemming from the Rushdie novel opened ``alldoors'' to improving ties with Moscow.   It said the two main irritants to better relations with Moscow _the Soviet supply of arms to Iran's enemy in the 8-year Iran-Iaqwar, and the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan _ were removedat a time when ``the West has pushed its relations with Iran to anall time low.''   Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the importance of ``theexpansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting thedevilish acts of the West,'' Tehran Radio reported. It broadcastextensive excerpts from the meeting at Khomeini's home, which IRNAsaid was believed to be the first private meeting between Iran's88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister.   Tehran Television showed Khomeini, wearing a skullcap and robeswith a blanket over his knees, talking to Shevardnadze.   The Soviet leader later met Musavi and the two agreed to set upmechanisms for ``regulating political contacts'' between Moscow andTehran, Tehran radio said.   Shervardnadze said Nikolai Konarev, chairman of the Iran-Sovietjoint economic commission, will visit Iran shortly ``withsignificant proposals,'' IRNA reported.   ``We hope significant chances will take place in bilateralcooperation in the political and economic fields as a result of thecurrent atmosphere,'' he told Musavi.   Shevardnadze was scheduled to return to Moscow on Monday. HisMiddle East trip was 10 days.</TEXT></DOC>
