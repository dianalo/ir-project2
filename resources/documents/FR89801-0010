L. 100-203(the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987). Section 1611(c)(5) ofthe Act, effective April 1, 1988, provides that the Supplemental SecurityIncome (SSI) benefit for a month will be computed using the amount of certainassistance payments received in the same month, rather than the amountof these payments received in a prior month.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective on August 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Irving Darrow, Esq., Legal Assistant,3-B-1 Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235,(301) 965-1755.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Pursuant to section 1611(c) of theAct, the SSI benefit amount is determined based on income in the secondprior month rather than the current month. This is known as retrospectivemonthly accounting (RMA). The statute provides an exception to this generalrule under which benefit amounts for the first 3 months of eligibilityor reeligibility are based on income in the first month of eligibilityor reeligibility. These provisions are contained in 20 CFR 416.420. Section 1611(c)(5) of the Act, as added by section 9106 of Pub. L. 100-203,provides a further limited exception to the statutory rule for countingincome in determining benefit amounts. Under this special rule, incomein the form of certain assistance payments will be considered in determiningthe benefit amount for the month in which it is received (the current month)rather than having such income received in a prior month determine thecurrent month's benefit amount. These assistance payments are as follows:(1) Aid to families with Dependent Children under title IV-A of the SocialSecurity Act (the Act); (2) Foster Care under title IV-E of the Act; (3) Refugee Cash Assistance pursuant to section 412(e) of the Immigrationand Nationality Act; (4) Cuban and Haitian Entrant Assistance pursuant to section 501(a) ofPub. L. 96-422; and (5) Bureau of Indian Affairs general assistance and child welfare assistancepursuant to 42 Stat. 208 as amended. This final rule amends andSection; 416.420(b) of the current regulationsto include this statutory change. <ITAG tagnum="84">Justification for Dispensing With Rulemaking Procedures </ITAG>The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy,generally follows the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice of proposedrulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in thedevelopment of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its noticeand comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensingwith such procedures. Section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA exempts applicationof notice and comment rulemaking procedures ``when the agency for goodcause finds * * * that notice and public procedures thereon are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' We are dispensing withnotice and comment rulemaking in the case of this rule because such rulemakingis unnecessary since this rule merely reflects the provisions of section1611(c)(5) of the Social Security Act, as added by section 9106 of Pub.L. 100-203, and does not contain any policies established by the Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Executive Order No. 12291 The Secretary has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291, because program and administrative costs are entirely theresult of legislation and not this rule. The program and administrativecosts will be insignificant and savings are estimated at less than $1 milliona year. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it affects only individuals.Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.
