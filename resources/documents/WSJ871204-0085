It was the most banks closed in a day since seven were shut down May 31, 1985. It brought the total closed nationwide this year to 173. The closed banks, all small, single-office institutions, reopen today as branches of other banks that acquired them with financial help from the FDIC.    The Nebraska State Department of Banking and Finance said four Nebraska banks closed because of their &quot;inability to fully collect on loans made to some of the shareholders, directors and officers of the banks and their associates.&quot;    The failed banks are:   --State Bank of Commerce, Slidel, La., which was acquired by Peoples Bank andamp; Trust Co. of St. Bernard, Chalmette, La. State Bank had $47.8 million in assets and $46.3 million in deposits.    --Madison Bank andamp; Trust Co., Richmond, La., by Guaranty Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Delhi, La. Madison had $9.8 million in assets and $10.4 million in deposits.    --Crofton State Bank, Crofton, Neb., by Farmers andamp; Merchants State Bank, Bloomfield, Neb. Crofton State had assets of $11.3 million and deposits of $10.6 million.    --Center State Bank, Center, Neb., also by Farmers andamp; Merchants State Bank. Center State had $8.4 million in assets and $7.8 million in deposits.    --First State Bank, Oakdale, Neb., by First United Bank, Neligh, Neb. First State had assets of $5.9 million and deposits of $5.6 million.    --State Bank of Jansen, Jansen, Neb., by Security National Bank, Superior, Neb. State Bank had assets of $4.9 million and deposits of $4.6 million.    --Farmers National Bank of Cordell, Cordell, Okla., by First National Bank andamp; Trust Co., Weatherford, Okla. Farmers National had assets of $69.1 million and $60.2 million in deposits.    --Peoples Bank, Olive Hill, Ky., by Commercial Bank of Grayson, Grayson, Ky. Peoples Bank had $39.7 million in assets and $38.6 million in deposits.    --Climbing Hill Savings Bank, Climbing Hill, Iowa, by First Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Moville, Iowa. Climbing Hill's assets totaled $5.3 million and it held $5.1 million in deposits.    At the same time, an FDIC-assisted takeover averted the failure of Crossroads Bank, Victoria, Texas. An investor group headed by Dorothy Ploeger put up $2.5 million to acquire the bank and its $26 million in assets. </TEXT></DOC>
