Mr. Griffin's $225 million offer would top a $22-a-share bid by New York developer Donald Trump, who holds 88% of the voting control of the company. However, the offer appeared to face major roadblocks. It is contingent upon the support of Mr. Trump, chairman of Resorts, although it offers only $35 a share for his Class B holdings. He paid $135 a share for them. Mr. Trump called the bid &quot;the most preposterous proposal I've ever seen.&quot;    Resorts, based in Atlantic City, N.J., operates casinos and hotels there and on Paradise Island, the Bahamas. Mr. Trump took control of the company last year, asserting that he could rectify troubles at its biggest project, construction of the Taj Mahal hotel-casino in Atlantic City. The project has been plagued by cost overruns and needs further financing for completion.    The Griffin bid also is contingent upon approval by the Resorts board and termination of a management contract between Resorts and Trump company that could be valued at $100 million. In addition, it is dependent upon court rejection of a proposed settlement of shareholder litigation against Mr. Trump. Terms of the proposed settlement include acceptance by Resorts holders of Mr. Trump's latest, $22-a-share offer; he had increased that offer from $15 a share partly in response to shareholder suits. The Trump offer is valued at about $125 million.    The Delaware Chancery Court was scheduled to begin a hearing today on the settlement, which would allow Mr. Trump's offer to proceed.    Despite rejection of the Griffin offer by Mr. Trump and the Resorts board committee, Resorts shares yesterday jumped $3.375 to close at $25.25. The issue was the second-most active trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, with 629,400 shares changing hands.    Mr. Trump owns 95% of Resorts International's 752,297 Class B shares; each share carries 100 votes, while each of the 5.7 million Class A shares carries one vote. The Class A shares, which are the shares traded on the American Stock Exchange, represent most of the equity in the company.    Morris Orens, a New York attorney for Mr. Griffin, said the bid was timed to hold up the Delaware court settlement and to force the Resorts board to consider the Griffin offer. Although the former television talk-show host appears to have lost the first round, Mr. Orens says he is considering filing a breach-of-fiduciary-duty suit against Mr. Trump and the special board committee, which consists of three outside directors who aren't tied to Mr. Trump.    &quot;Mr. Trump is the fiduciary to other shareholders. If he is only willing to pay $22 and someone else is willing to pay $35, why is Trump standing in the way?&quot; Mr. Orens said.    Mr. Griffin, who bought the Beverly Hilton Hotel last year for $100.2 million, doesn't currently hold any Resorts shares, although he has an option to buy half the holdings of dissident Resorts holder F.V. Scutti, a Florida investor who owns about 5% of the Class A shares. Mr. Scutti has filed an objection to the proposed court settlement.    Richard Greenfield, an attorney representing many Class A holders in the Delaware suit, said he wasn't seriously considering the Griffin offer, largely because it is conditioned on Mr. Trump's support. &quot;It's basically telling Donald, 'Go commit harikari,'&quot; Mr. Greenfield said.    Analysts also expressed doubt about the Griffin offer, noting that Mr. Griffin and Mr. Scutti, the dissident holder, both are represented in the matter by Mr. Orens.    Mr. Griffin wasn't available for comment on how he would finance the purchase. &quot;Mr. Griffin believes he will have no trouble getting the financing,&quot; said his attorney, Mr. Orens. Mr. Griffin in 1986 sold his Merv Griffin Enterprises, a TV-production company, to Coca-Cola Co. for about $250 million.    In an action related to the acquisition proposals, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed about $505 million of Resorts long-term debt under review for a possible downgrade. The credit-rating concern said the review was prompted by its &quot;increasing concern that Resorts will be unable to fund completion&quot; of the Taj Mahal project if Mr. Trump's acquisition of the rest of the company isn't &quot;consummated on a timely basis.&quot; The review involves Moody's single-B-2 rating of subordinated debentures issued by Resorts and a unit. </TEXT></DOC>
