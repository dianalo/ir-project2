The bond market's bellwether security, the Treasury's30-year bond, ended more than 1/4 point lower yesterday, or$2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue'syield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price,rose to 7.41% from 7.39% on Wednesday.</LP><TEXT>   The government's employment report for December isscheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. EST. Most economistsexpect it to show a weak labor market -- which would befavorable for the bond market. Economists polled by Dow JonesCapital Markets Report project that non-farm payrolls willshow a decline of about 74,000 for December. Payrolls dropped241,000 in November.   Based partly on those expectations, bond prices openedhigher. But around midsession yesterday, rumors spread thatgovernment figures had been leaked and showed a sharp rise inpayrolls during December. That put bond prices undersubstantial pressure. The Labor Department said it had noevidence of a leak and wasn't investigating the reports.   Traders said that some investors used the rumors as anexcuse to take profits. &quot;It was the more speculativeaccounts&quot; that sold, said Paul McCormack, head Treasurytrader at Chase Securities Inc. &quot;Pension funds and moneymanagers haven't been selling, that's for sure.&quot;   Meanwhile, corporations continued to shower investors withnew notes and bonds, although issuance slowed sharply fromWednesday, when more than $5 billion of corporate debt wasoffered. Issuance of new Eurobonds, however, showed no signsof slowing, and some dealers said yesterday that the supplyof new Eurobonds is falling short of demand.   Yesterday's issue by the International Bank forReconstruction and Development, or World Bank, of $1.5billion of 10-year notes sold out quickly. The notes werepriced to yield 6.88%.   Treasury bond prices were also helped by governmentinflation data released yesterday morning. The LaborDepartment said the producer price index, a measure ofinflation on the producer or wholesale level, dropped 0.2% inDecember. The core rate of inflation, which excludes food andenergy prices, rose 0.2%. Also favorable for the bond market,which does well in a slow economy, was news that initialclaims for state unemployment insurance rose 22,000 in thelatest week, compared with expectations of only a 9,000 rise.   Gilbert Benz, economist at Swiss Bank Corp., said thedecline in wholesale inflation was helped by lower prices inthe energy sector. &quot;And there isn't any sign of pricepressure anywhere else, either,&quot; Mr. Benz added.   As the bond market rallied, the March bond futurescontract rose to the highest price ever paid for a bondcontract at the Chicago Board of Trade. The March bond tradedat 105 20/32, the highest level of its 14-year history. Butfutures prices declined in unison with the rest of the marketonce the rumors about today's employment data hit the market.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended weaker on the rumors about the employmentsituation.   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 106 29/32to yield 7.41%, compared with 107 7/32 to yield 7.39%Wednesday. Ten-year notes declined to 105 1/32 to yield 6.77%compared with 105 8/32 to yield 6.74%.   There was little reaction late in the session to therelease of surprisingly weak money-supply data for the latestweek. The M2 component of the monetary aggregates dropped$6.1 billion, compared with expectations that it would remainunchanged. M1 was down $2.6 billion, but had been expected todrop only $100 million, while M3 declined $16.9 billion. M3had been forecast to slip a mere $2.1 billion.   James Winder, money-market economist at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co., says there was little market reaction to the data,because the declines probably reflect investors moving fundsout of money-market accounts and into higher-yieldinginvestments, as money-market interest rates continue toslide.   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $12.53 billion of 52-weekbills at an average rate of 3.84%. That was down from 4.20%at the previous 52-week bill auction Dec. 12 and was thelowest average rate since 3.59% at the March 31, 1971,auction.                                                                                                                              52-WEEK BILLS                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.

Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of dollar-denominated Eurobonds eased in sympathywith a slumping U.S. Treasury market, but demand for newEurobond issues remained strong.   The biggest issuer was the International Bank forReconstruction and Development, or World Bank. Thedevelopment bank, which is based in Washington but owned by aconsortium of 156 countries, sold $1.5 billion of 10-yearnotes denominated in U.S. dollars in a &quot;global&quot; offering.Global transactions involve simultaneous offerings in variousmajor financial centers around the world.   The offering found greater-than-expected demand frominvestors in Asia, according to Paul Seigelbaum, head ofdollar borrowing at the World Bank. He estimates that about40% of the issue sold in the Far East, with Europe takingabout 35% and the U.S. 25%.   Dealers said the notes traded strongly after they weresold. The notes were priced to yield 6.88%, a spread of 0.15percentage point above the 10-year Treasury. Later in theday, the spread narrowed to 0.10 percentage point as theprice moved up to 99.44 from an initial 99.07.   New dollar-denominated bonds issued by Britain's hotelchain Forte PLC and Swiss foods giant Nestle Holdings Inc.also found strong demand. Forte sold $200 million of 5 3/8%two-year Eurobonds priced to yield 5.41% via Goldman SachsInternational PLC. Nestle's $200 million five-year bondspriced to yield 6.27% were &quot;an absolute sell-out,&quot; accordingto several market participants. The borrower is popular withSwiss investors, and despite what were considered aggressiveterms, the issue sold out in minutes, underwriters said.   Among U.S. borrowers in the Eurobond market was GeneralElectric Credit Corp., the financial unit of General ElectricCo. GECC sold 250 million marks of five-year notes priced toyield 7.68% through J.P. Morgan G.m.b.H. It also sold 175billion Italian lira of three-year notes through underwritersat Paribas Capital Markets. The notes were priced to yield11.58%.   Ontario Hydro, a Canadian government-controlled electricutility, disclosed plans yesterday for a new global bondoffering of at least one billion Canadian dollars (US$875million) shortly. The bonds will probably have a 10-yearmaturity.   Although many of Ontario Hydro's past offerings have beengreeted by strong demand, underwriting specialists say someinvestors are concerned about the financial health of Ontarioprovince, which guarantees Ontario Hydro bonds.   Analysts say Ontario's credit rating might deterioratethis year as its economy continues to languish and itsborrowing requirement rises. As budget negotiations get underway in the province, the Toronto Globe and Mail reportedyesterday that Premier Bob Rae will soon go on television towarn of the province's &quot;desperate economic situation.&quot;   Ontario officials, meanwhile, sought to quell investorconcerns. &quot;It's reasonable to say {Ontario's} borrowingrequirement is likely to be higher&quot; this year, said SandraTychsen, director of capital markets research at theprovince's Treasury. But she said she doesn't expect thecredit rating agencies to change their views of theprovince's standing.                                                                                                          Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bonds of R.H. Macy andamp; Co. plunged yesterday, althougha company spokesman denied rumors that prompted the declines.   According to traders, bond investors are concerned thatmanufacturers -- nervous because of the weak Christmasselling season -- will stop shipping goods to Macy. That,they fear, would force Macy to file for protection underChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code just to get inventory.   A Macy spokesman dismissed those concerns. &quot;These rumorshave been around for months and for years, and it hasn'thappened, and it's not going to happen,&quot; Michael Freitag, thespokesman for Macy at Kekst andamp; Co., said.   Liz Claiborne Inc., which is said by analysts to be amongMacy's largest suppliers, currently is shipping goods toMacy, its chief executive officer, Jerome Chazen, told DowJones Capital Markets Report. Liz Claiborne is a New Yorkclothing designer.   Despite the denials, prices of Macy's bonds ended sharplylower. Hardest hit were the zero-coupon bonds, which fellseven points to an offered price of 29. The bonds had beenrising earlier in the week on a research report by J.P.Morgan Securities Inc. analyst Michael Cha.   Mr. Cha reinstated his &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on the Macybonds and said he doesn't envision any major problems in theshort term in Macy's relationships with manufacturers. &quot;Sincethe banks appear to be on board, I think {Macy's suppliers}are going to be on board,&quot; he said.   But even if Macy's suppliers are accommodating, saysMeredith Adler, an analyst at First Boston Corp., Macy couldface some problems down the road. By the 1992 pre-Christmasseason, Ms. Adler anticipates that the company could need asmuch as $150 million to $200 million of additional borrowingcapacity. &quot;Maybe they'll get through the spring, but theycould run into stumbling blocks by next Christmas season,&quot;she said.   In the broader high-yield market, prices of most junkbonds ended little changed. Investment-grade corporate bondsedged lower, registering losses of 1/4 to 3/8 point.   New issues continued to roll out. Among the biggestcorporate issuers was El Paso Natural Gas Co., which offered$575 million of debt securities in three parts. The companysold $100 million of five-year notes priced to yield 6.90%,$215 million of 10-year notes yielding 7.786% and $260million of 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.689%.   A number of banks were also in the public debt markets.Bankers Trust New York Corp. offered $300 million ofthree-year notes yielding 5.32%, while J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. sold$200 million of 10-year subordinated notes at a yield of7.264%.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of active municipals finished little changed inmoderately active trading.   Denver airport system revenue bonds declined slightly eventhough Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. raised its rating on the bondsto triple-B from triple-B-minus.   In upgrading the Denver airport bonds, Sandamp;P cited thecommitment of UAL Corp.'s United Air Lines Inc. to use theairport facility now under construction and slated to open inlate 1993.   Prices of the Denver bonds have been under pressure onconcern about whether Continental Airlines, a major carrierin the region that now is under bankruptcy-law protection,will make the new airport its hub.   In trading yesterday, Denver airport's 7 3/4% bonds due2021 were quoted at 99 3/4, off 1/8 point, to yield 7.23%.Some traders said the bonds could rise 1/4 to 1/2 point todayas more investors become aware of the rating change.   The airport is expected to sell $300 million of bonds inmid-February. The rating change is &quot;a definite positive signfor the next bond issue,&quot; said Gene Andrist, a vice presidentof municipal finance for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Denver.   Elsewhere in the market, it was reported yesterday thatconcerns about disclosure kept underwriters at First ChicagoCapital Markets Inc. from bidding on an offering Tuesday of$31.9 million University of Illinois certificates ofparticipation.   In the past several years, disclosure has become a hottopic in the municipal bond market, where rules andguidelines for disclosure are not nearly as rigorous as theyare in the corporate bond market.   First Chicago balked at bidding on the bonds because apreliminary offering statement didn't contain informationabout Illinois's budget deficit of about $500 million for thefiscal year ending June 30, said Harry Larson, president ofFirst Chicago Capital Markets. About half of the $8 millionto $9 million of annual debt service payments on thecertificates is payable from state appropriations.   Information on the state's financial situation wasn'tincluded in the offering statement because definiteinformation about the size of the deficit and measures toclose it wasn't available when the statement was prepared inDecember, according to officials at the University ofIllinois and its financial adviser, John Nuveen andamp; Co.   &quot;I think it's just an honest difference of opinion,&quot; saysFirst Chicago's Mr. Larson. &quot;We just felt that would havebeen an appropriate disclosure.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          IT IS TOO SOON to predict the province of Ontario'sborrowing requirements for this year, according to SandraTychsen of the provincial Treasury. Ms. Tychsen wasincorrectly quoted in Friday's edition as saying it wasreasonable to expect requirements to be higher.   (WSJ Jan. 13, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
