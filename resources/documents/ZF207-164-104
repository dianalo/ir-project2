 At the same time, they havefailed to take an interest in the work of the business for whichthey are producing a tool.andP;  Users frequently share in thedevelopment process only through beta tests of products, longafter they have been designed.andP;  Users can frequently be a constantsource of data on work habits, loads and performance requirements.andO;Developers can keep up with user needs the same way they arerequired to to keep up with changes in technology.andP;  More than oneuser needs to be consulted.andP;  Maintaining a good relationshipbetween the development and user communities insures a healthydevelopment process.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     User NeedsSystem DevelopmentApplications ProgrammingManagement of EDPSoftware DesignUser Relations.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Systems Design with The User in MindandM;During the last two decades, while automation of the business world hasproceeded at an ever-accelerating pace, the practitioners of the black art ofsystems development have jealously guarded the secrets of their trade.andO;Members of today's computer cult, who talk among themselves in tongues ofCOBOL, PProlog, and CASE, have forgotten the sounds of the human language--somuch so that it's often necessary to hire a translator to explain the systemsdevelopers' work to the confused customer, the actual user of the cult'shandiwork.andM;This translator would not be needed if companies would design their systemswith the user in mind.andP;  That means involving end users right at the start ofthe systems development process.andP;  To accomplish this, the technical staffmust take some time away from studying the nuts and bolts of new tools tolearn the tricks of the users' trade.andM;It also means that the end users themselves have to be encouraged to getinvolved in the entire systems development effort, from the specificationstage to actual application testing.andP;  Their involvement will help ensure thatthe finished system meets their needs and, in turn, the information needs ofthe corporation.andM;Today, under traditional systems analysis methods, the user is frequentlyleft out of the loop.andP;  During the standard requirements definition phase,representatives from the user department are interviewed.andP;  Then a work flowanalysis may be performed to determine the relationships between functionswithin that department.andP;  Finally, several months after the requirementsdefinition, some customer testing is conducted--testing that unfortunatelyconstitutes the sum total of user involvement.andP;  So it's not surprising that aplethora of changes have to be made after the user finally reviews the testresults.andM;The systems staff can avoid this last-minute retrofit by building a systemtailored to specific end-user needs.andP;  To do that tailoring, the IS teamshould apply the same quick-study principle that it uses in keeping up withnew technology to learning end-user job functions.andP;  In fact, systemsdesigners should know these functions at least as well as a six-monthemployee who is doing that work.andM;The necessary knowledge, however, is not always easy to come by, because alltoo often systems gurus balk at attending user meetings.andP;  A big price tag maybe attached to such behavior, as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) foundout.andP;  During the mid-'80s, a series of user meetings were held to determinethe rules and regulations of an important regultory system that the Exchangewanted to develop.andP;  The NYSE's IS group found these crucial meetings boring,and as a consequence the finished system ended up being incomplete and muchmoney had to be spent adding enhancement features.andM;A thorough immersion in the customer's culture also negates the we versusthey attitude that comes between many end users and the supporting IS staff.andO;Top managers in the IS division at the Swiss Bank in New York learned thislesson the hard way.andP;  Back in the early '80s, the bank's foreign exchangetrading group was adamant about needing a foreign exchange trading system.andO;The head of Swiss Bank's IS department disagreed.andP;  So the trading groupbrought in an outside consultant who spoke their language and carefullylistened to what they had to say.andM;As a result, the consultant was able to develop a usable, mostly error-fresystem that the users proudly showed of to other departments at the bank.andP;  Atthe next IS status meeting, users demanded to know why the Is staff could notor would not deliver systems as fast and as good as the one built by theforeign exchange folks.andP;  Needless to say, the management of Swiss Bank's ISgroup was soon replaced.andM;Once you have a user-friendly IS staff, then you need to drum up enthusiasmand interest among the user community so that it will want to be involvedevery painful step of the way.andP;  &quot;Community&quot; is the operative word here, sinceas many users as is feasible should be involved in the systems developmentprocess.andP;  In today's systems world, however, the norm is to have only oneuser who serves as the liaison for the entire group and assists the IS teamas it develops specifications and tests the application.andM;Can one person adequately represent an entire user group?andP;  The answer isalmost always no if you want a system that's worth its development dollars.andO;Although involving many users can cause giant headaches, if the process isproperly handled, the resulting system will be far superior.andP;  That was theexperience of the NYSE, which in 1985 was faced with the challenging chore ofdevising a system for over 150 professional users spread through fiveseparate departments.andM;Despite the fact that each of the five departments did the exact same job,the diversity of opinion among the people in these units was nearlyoverwhelming.andP;  It took the great organizational skills of a talented analystto pull all the heterogeneous information together into one cohesivespecification.andP;  What resulted was a far more complex but much more accurateand usable system that covered all the bases.andM;To cover all those bases, the NYSE IS team formed a working committee ofusers made up of one very verbal representative from each of the fivedepartments.andP;  For roughly three months prior to the start of thespecification stage, this working group would sometimes meet as often as twoor three times a week.andM;The meetings were spent discussing actual cases upon which the system wouldbe based.andP;  In this way, the users were able to come up with all of thecriteria that would utlimately be used in developing the system.andP;  It wasduring this conceptual phase of system definition that NYSE's IS staff andthe departmental end users were able to reach a meeting of the minds in termsof desired inputs and outputs.andM;Determining the users' real information needs in indeed the stickiest wicketof the entire specification process.andP;  If all you do is translate the paperavalanche to the tube, then the ultimate system will not be much better thanthe former manual one.andP;  In fact, many of these paperwork clone systemsactually decrease productivity.andM;The key to pinpointing the users' actual information needs is not to presentmore data, but to present less data that's more meaningful or relevant.andP;  Todate, IS has applied the pitch-hit-and-run theory to most systemsdevelopment.andP;  Little, if any, consideration has been given to the differinginformation requirements of the various decision-making levels within anorganization.andP;  As a result, what you end up with is fancy applications thatspit out a kludge of irrelevant information.andM;There are several time-tested methods the developer can follow to avoid thatsystems scenario and to present the optimum mix of detail and composite datato users.andP;  All of the methods recognize that there is a relationship betweenthe type of user and the level of detail needed to do the job or make adecision.andM;The three types of users--technical, tactical, and strategic--correspond tothe three levels of workers in today's typical corporation.andP;  The technicalusers are generally the paper pushers in the corporate hierarchy.andP;  Theseemployees--the check processors, the complaint takers, for example--are thepeople who need to see all the data.andP;  They input and review a wealth of data,normally in rote fashion.andM;At the opposite end of the spectrum are the senior managers, who useinformation gathered at the lower rungs for strategic purpose.andP;  A whole rangeof executive information and decision support systems are now available tohelp this corporate vanguard.andP;  These wares feature flashy colors on touchscreens that are notable for the sparsity of data displayed.andP;  The data islikely to show sales projections, profitability numbers, and comparisons withthe competition.andM;In the middle, between the strategic users and the technical users, are thetactical users.andP;  These are the middle managers, the poor unfortunates buriedunder the paper avalanche.andP;  It's these professionals who therefore need themost careful balance of data.andM;As always, the users' needs dictate the data representation discipline used.andO;Human resources or utility users, for example, are good candidates fordescriptive models that can come in the form of organization charts or floorplans.andP;  Modeling is also a good mode for operations management students whowant to apply game theory to problems that lack supporting information.andP;  Onthe other hand, a normative representation of data is an apt choice forbudget personnel, who need to have the best answer to a given problem.andM;Deciding on the type of information and how to present it to a particulargroup of users is the job of IS personnel.andP;  Sometimes they get carried awaywith their mission.andP;  At the NYSE, for example, the systems staff realizedthey had gone too far when a display for a large customer exceeded 91 screensof information.andP;  Going back to the drawing board, they came up with a plan tomake the 91-screen monster more manageable.andM;What they did was use graphics to tame the tangle of numbers displayed,coupled with embedded expert systems that enabled users to navigate quicklyand more effectively through the data.andP;  In this filtering process, thesystems developer sifts through the data, displaying only what is relevant atany point in time.andM;One way to do the filtering is by using the monitoring method, which servesup data to the user on an exception basis.andP;  This can take the form ofvariance reporting, in which the system produces only exceptions that arebased on a programmatic review of the data.andP;  After reviewing credit cardpayments, a system can, for instance, display only those accounts where thepayment is overdue or below the minimum.andP;  The monitoring method can also beused in programmed decision-making applications, in which case the systemmakes all of the technical decisions and many of the tactical ones as well.andM;American Exrpess made the decision to go with a monitoring method thatsimplifies its complex credit authorization chores.andP;  An expert system, aptlynamed Authorizer Assistant, has helped Amex reduce the percentage of badcredit authorizations.andP;  It has also reduced the number of screens needed toreview customer data from a high of 12 to a manageable two.andM;The advent of fourth generation languages (4GLs), which enable end users toaccess corporate databases with an easy-to-use query syntax, has madeinterrogative methods of systems design more popular today.andP;  Implicit in thisapproach is the understanding that there are many occasions when users incomplex decision-making environments cannot identify the information theyneed to perform ad hoc analyses.andP;  In these cases, all of the data elementsmust be resident in an accessible databse.andP;  There must also be a tool thatallows users to easily develop queries and variations on these queriesagainst the data.andM;The ease-of-use factor provided by a 4GL came in very handy when BankersTrust in New York opted to leave the retail business in the early '80s.andP;  Thedata processing effort required to achieve this feat was enormous.andP;  With thehelp of Focus, the 4GL product from Information Builders in New York, thebank was able to ensure a smooth transfer of accounts from Bankers to manyother far-flung financial institutions.andP;  Some accounts were spun off to abank in Chicago, some to Albany, N.Y., while a few high rollers were retainedas privileged Bankers Trust customers.andM;Once users are certain about the correct way to handle the data, the IS squadcan then translate this information into the specification that spells outhow the system should run.andP;  In many IS shops, how a system should run is afunction of what is available in-house.andP;  This means that user requirementsare forcibly fit into an existing toolset.andP;  And just like a bad shoe fit, abad system fit causes users gfreat pain.andM;Some of that pain was felt at the NYSE's automation arm, the SecuritiesIndustry Automation Corp. (SIAC), which temporarily cramped its users bylimiting itself to just one database product.andP;  SIAC began using Total fromCincom Systems Inc., Cincinnati, back in 1977, when there were few databasetools on the market.andP;  There was absolutely nothing wrong with Total.andP;  Whatwas wronmg was the implicit order to use it for all systems.andP;  And use it SIACdid--for everything!andM;Total is now gone from SIAC, replaced by a better stocked tool chest, whichincludes DL/I from IBM, IDMS from Cullinet Software Inc., Westwood, Mass.,andO;and such 4GL databases as IC/1 from IBM and RAMIS from On-Line SoftwareInternational, Fort Lee, N.J.andP;  SIAC learned what other firms are fast findingout: a greater selection of software arms the designer with the optionsneeded to tailor a system to specific user demands.andM;Good tailoring is particularly crucial when it comes to designing theexternal component of a system that the users see.andP;  While users aren'texposed to internal intricacies like utilities and overnight updating, theyroutinely work with external features such as on-line updates and reports,and PC uploading and downloading.andM;Most IS shops today design superbly efficient systems--for batch.andO;Unfortunately, they're then jury-rigged for the part of the system that'svisible to the user.andP;  Such technology tinkering often leaves the user out ona limb.andM;That's exactly where some end users at the NYSE found themselves when abilling system that used the DL/1 datbase was defined to RAMIS.andP;  Thedatabase, which was composed of numerous segments of data that were all keyedby a brokerage firm number, ran very fast during overnight update processingdue to its efficient design, specifically labored over for this purpose.andM;Meanwhile, some NYSE users were anticipating a new system with the extraadded attraction of ad hoc inquiry.andP;  By a happy coincidence--or so it wasoriginally thought--RAMIS had just been brought into the Exchange forend-user computing.andP;  The DL/1 database was dutifully defined to RAMIS; theusers were trained and then let loose.andP;  RAMIS came up empty.andM;The problem was that bane of logic, the JOIN.andP;  While the internal databasewas segmented into a logical structure for efficiencies, the data on everybrokerage house was dispersed throughout, making it difficult for the usersto get to it without understanding a bit more than they wanted to know aboutinformation processing.andM;Information center personnel, with their knowledge of PCs and networking, canoften the big help in designing the external component of the system.andO;Another tip for achieving user-friendly software is to prototype all externalcomponents of the system.andM;There are as many ways of designing systems as there are people to use them.andO;Most systems are designed out of prejudice.andP;  John Doe, the databaseadministrator at the Widet Corp., is expert at DL/1.andP;  Therefore, all systemsat the company are designed using DL/1.andP;  Most corporate systems are designedaround some sort of database rather than the file systems of the early '70s.andO;Three database structures are currently prevalent: hierarchical, as in DL/1;networked, as in 1DMS; and relational, as in IBM's DB2.andP;  The proper choicedepends upon many factors, not the least of which should be ease of access bythe user.andM;Serious decisions must also be made regarding the system platform.andP;  In aworld of mainframes, PCs, mini-computers, and advanced workstations, theendless possibilities boggle the systems developer's mind.andP;  Solutions run thegamut from pure mainframe to a cluster of connected micros and minis.andP;  Invogue today is an any-to-any environment where a user with a smartworkstation has easy access to various mainframes, minis, or PCs.andM;Choosing the hardware and software is truly the fun part of systems design.andO;Visists to vendors and trips to trade shows where you can play with testequipment transport you into a dp Disneyland.andP;  But while you're out theregetting high techning it up, at some point you better come down to earth andget the user involved.andP;  If not, your dream machine will turn into anexpensive nightmare.andM;So, no matter what platform or program you pick, the user variables in makingyour selection must be examined at every technological turn.andP;  Among thoseuser considerations are cost, ease of use, access to corporate data, graphicsrequirements compatibility with current environment and particularpreferences.andM;Ease of use was the major criterion that caused some equipment the NYSE wasconsidering to be scuttled in 1986.andP;  The equipment under investigation werebar code readers for use in the field.andP;  The technical group at the Exchange,who thought they had found the perfect solution, promptly ordered sampleequipment and found that it worked like a charm.andP;  But in order for it do so,the credit-card size readers had to be held at a certain angle.andP;  It was agood thing the users were consulted, because it turned out that they were notable to hold the devices at that precise angle.andM;The lesson here is that just because you find it easy to use doesn't mean theuser will necessarily agree with you.andP;  Also, keep in mind that just becauseit's state of the art and your technical staff adores it doesn't mean theuser will concur.andP;  It all adds up to input: the user needs to have a say inthe selection process.andM;This lesson is particularly pertinent when it comes to developing thespecification for on-line screens and reports--the most visible part of anysystem.andP;  What frequently happens is that the IS people gather information andcreate a specification.andP;  After six to 12 months, they're ready to demo thesystem they developed to the users.andP;  With so much time interventing, theusers have invariably either changed their minds about what they want to theyhave altogether forgotten what they want.andM;At Bankers Trust, when it was developing an equipment leasing system, thattime was not allowed to elapse without user feedback.andP;  Instead, the bankdecided to rapid-prototype the system for users.andP;  During the specificationstage, a series of screens were put up on the system within a matter of days.andO;Users were given an ID into the system so they could play with the prototype.andO;They got the feel for the system and were able to voice their opinions andobjections immediately.andM;An even more daring user approach was taken recently by the NYSE.andP;  CertainExchange users were given an on-line editor and told to develop the screensthemselves.andP;  IS staffers held their breath for many days, fearing the outcomeof this experiment.andP;  They needn't have feared; users know what they want tosee and how they want to see it.andP;  So forget about textbook cases of goodscreen design and give your users a paintbrush.andM;Far more control is necessary in the system testing phase, however.andP;  Usersare notorious for their lax standards when theyhre invovled in testing.andO;Therefore, the IS group must carefully oversee a test plan that covers allfacets of the system, using as many test cases and as many users as possible.andM;In 1986, the systems squad at the NYSE exercised both caution and control intesting a very large financial system that was distributed across a group ofseven users.andP;  The users were asked to compare test results with raw data andto annotate screen printouts or reports as appropriate.andP;  Because the userswere given very specific tasks and very specific instructions (not the usual&quot;take a look at the system and let me know if you see anything wrong&quot;), thesystem was 99% debugged before it went into production.andM;Once the system has been tested, it's time to go live.andP;  Ideally, the usershave been involved every step of the way in the design process, and painshave been taken to keep all those who will ultimately use the system informedof its progress.andM;These reports to users generate excitement, as CIT Financial found out in1976.andP;  Way before CIT's acquisition by Manufacturers Hanover, the companywhet users' appetites by issuing a newsletter that described the features ofa soon-to-be-released system.andM;Several years ago, the Securities andamp; Exchange Commission stirred up userinterest by running a contest to name their system and giving out awards tothe winner--a move that would qualify as good user PR.andP;  Anothertried-and-true PR ploy is to stage glitzy system demos complete withrefreshments.andP;  After showtime, it's important to keep the name of the systemin front of the potential users.andP;  NYSE developers, who designed a systemnamed Force, did just that by distributing pens inscribed with the slogan&quot;May the FORCE be with you.&quot;andM;While the points I've mentioned are all quite obvious, they're oftenoverlooked by harried IS staffs.andP;  The result is installed systems that aredeemed successful by technicians but are dubbed flops by users.andP;  So, todesign a system for all-around success, &quot;May the USER be with you.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
