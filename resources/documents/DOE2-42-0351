<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0351 </DOCNO><TEXT>Inversion-recovery (IR) sequences are an excellent method for acquiringTl-weighted images. Magnitude reconstruction produces an erroneous grayscale. Real reconstruction alone produces phase errors in the imageswhich can be removed by a phase correction procedure. The authors proposean abbreviated phase correction performed using an IR sequence withoutthe initial inversion pulse. As few as 20 central phase encode viewswill give adequate phase maps for correction. This phase map, acquiredwith minimum time penalty, is then used to undo the phase errors of theinterleaved IR image. Images obtained using IR, STIR, and motion-suppressedIR techniques are shown.</TEXT></DOC>
