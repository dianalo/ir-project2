The four-engine C-130, its huge fuel tanks running low, finallyturned and headed for land.   ``That was a perfectly boring patrol,'' said Joseph Koczur Jr.,a National Marine Fisheries Service agent.   ``Well, we learned where they aren't,'' the co-pilot, CoastGuard Lt. Cmdr. Mike Flood, said with a shrug.   Chalk up another frustrating day for the ``fish cops'' of theBering Sea, who fight a losing battle guarding the nation's richestdeepwater fishery against raids by an elusive foreign fleet.   This first leg of a two-day patrol covered a slice of ocean halfthe size of Kentucky _ and, for the number of foreign vessels seen,that's where the patrol may as well have been. Keeping the C-130airborne for the day cost taxpayers $27,000.   ``It's a big ocean,'' Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard'scommandant, said from his Washington office. ``It's like searchingfor a needle in a haystack.''   This year, it's like searching with one eye closed. Deficitreduction measures have cut back on fishery patrols. Four yearsago, a C-130 would take off daily from the Coast Guard's base onKodiak Island; now it's more like once a week.   American fishermen say the cuts come at a bad time, just asthey're finally claiming an area Congress made theirs in 1976 byextending U.S. jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore. And foreignfleets are not being polite about leaving the fishing grounds theypioneered decades ago.   By some estimates, foreign boats in the Bering Sea are illegallycatching up to $1 billion in fish each year, twice the amountcaught legally by Americans. Biologists worry that such poaching,combined with unregulated fishing just outside the U.S. zone, maythreaten fish stocks.   If a scale big enough could be found, the Bering Sea's hoard offish would weigh in at more than 30 billion pounds, a huge,swimming feedlot that is 65 percent Alaska pollock and 35 percentPacific cod, yellowfin sole, sablefish and a smattering of otherspecies. Collectively known as bottomfish, they provide an annualcatch worth more than all other U.S. deepwater fisheries combined.   For years, bottomfish were ignored by American fishermen seekingsalmon and crab. Foreigners, mainly Japanese, Koreans, Soviets andPoles, valued the fish more highly. Starting in the 1940s, theyfished these distant waters with huge trawlers, depleting stocks ofsome slow-growing species by the early 1960s.   Management improved in 1976, when the U.S. Fishery Conservationand Management Act established the 200-mile zone. The act alsocreated the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to regulateharvests.   Americans were given first shot at the bottomfish, but they hadneither the capital needed to build processing plants nor a marketfor the finished product. By 1981, foreign boats still accountedfor 93 percent of the Bering Sea bottomfish harvest.   Recently, more Americans have joined the bottomfish boom. Someare drawn by a keener U.S. appetite for fish and by worldwide priceincreases. Others, their crab boats idled by a drop in Alaska crabpopulations, just want to stay in business.   The fishery council has doled out progressively smaller catchquotas to the foreign fleet. This year, for the first time,American fishermen will catch all the fish within the 200-milelimit, although 60 percent are still sold to foreign processingships.   Foreign fishermen have been relegated to a triangle of high seasknown as the ``doughnut hole,'' a 45,000-square-mile pocket formedby the boundaries of the U.S. 200-mile zone on the east and south,and the Soviet convention line on the west.   The foreign catch of pollock in the doughnut hole has soared,from just over 4,000 metric tons in 1982 to an estimated 1 milliontons last year. That's close to the pollock catch allowed in therest of the Bering Sea.   In addition to producing this legal catch, the doughnut hole hasbecome, in the words of Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, ``ahaven for bandits.''   Just as fish ignore political boundaries, so do some foreignfishermen. ``They've been fishing the Bering Sea since the end ofWorld War II,'' said NMFS agent Koczur. ``If they want to come inand find fish, they know where to go.''   On the second day of Koczur's mission, the C-130 reached thepatrol area and descended to 1,500 feet. Cockpit radar showed abright green dot 40 miles beyond the limit, dead ahead. Soon theradar screen filled with dots.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
