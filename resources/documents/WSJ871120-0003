YangStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT TAXESECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Budget negotiators adjourned last night without an agreement, and said they won't avoid the start of the automatic budget-cutting process under the Gramm-Rudman law.    If those cuts commence today, the negotiators will have failed in one of their prime goals: to demonstrate, especially to financial markets, their ability to control the federal budget deficit.    &quot;We don't have an agreement,&quot; said Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee. But he added, &quot;The operational word is 'imminent.'&quot;    The outstanding obstacle is insistence by President Reagan and Republicans that the tax increase in the package be held to no more than $9 billion. Democrats say it should be larger to cover tax provisions that lose revenue, which already have been approved by congressional committees.    Participants said they must tie up other loose ends, including details of how the agreement would be enforced. But most numbers in the package, which is mostly an outline, have been accepted, they said.    Even if negotiators come to an agreement, however, the package couldn't be written into substantive law in time to meet today's Gramm-Rudman deadline. While the law's $23 billion in automatic, across-the-board cuts will have little immediate effect, the administration and the congressional leaders had vowed to head them off in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash.    White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said last night that President Reagan opposes an extension of the Gramm-Rudman law's deadline today, even if there is an agreement. This was a switch from the signals the White House was putting out Wednesday, when spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president would agree to extend the deadline if an agreement was close. The reversal stemmed from the realization that such a position took the time pressure off the negotiators.    In any event, both Republican and Democratic senators said that there aren't enough votes in the Senate to approve a delay.    The Gramm-Rudman cuts are &quot;going to take place tomorrow,&quot; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said yesterday. Added White House Chief Baker, &quot;He (President Reagan) said he won't go along with postponing sequester,&quot; the technical term for the across-the-board cuts.    Negotiators asserted that the talks hadn't broken down. They said they intend to return to work today, although they hadn't set a time.    Mr. Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker left the Capitol quickly after the adjournment. Democratic participants went to a private meeting in the office of House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).    &quot;We have not finished the process of agreement,&quot; said Mr. Foley. Added Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.): &quot;We haven't reached all of the material we need to cover.&quot;    &quot;We've got to take a breath and see what issues still remain to be solved,&quot; said Chief of Staff Baker.    Until late in the evening, the negotiators were working on a plan that was denounced yesterday by Republicans in caucuses in both the Senate and the House as containing too few nonmilitary spending cuts.    The package would contain savings that negotiators claim total $30.2 billion for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and $43.5 billion in the next fiscal year. In fact, the package will have just enough actual savings this year -- about $25 billion -- to avert the Gramm-Rudman cutbacks.    Military spending would be trimmed by about $4.9 billion this fiscal year and by about $9 billion next year. Nonmilitary spending, in appropriated programs, would be pared by $2 billion. Foreign aid would be cut by $600 million.    Entitlement programs, which are dictated by permanent law, would be reduced by $4 billion this fiscal year and $6 billion next fiscal year. The bulk of those savings come from Medicare and farm subsidies.    Nearly $10 billion in savings this fiscal year, and more than $11 billion next fiscal year, would come from fees charged to users of certain federal programs, the increased enforcement of tax laws and asset sales -- all savings heavily criticized by Republicans as either illusory or shortlived.    The stumbling block over taxes focuses on how much will be raised and how much control the president will have over which taxes will be raised once an accord is reached.    The Republicans want $9 billion to be the maximum gross amount that can be raised. &quot;Otherwise, Danny (Rostenkowski) can raise any amount of taxes . . . to pay for sweeteners to certain individuals and corporations,&quot; said House Republican Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi.    Mr. Rostenkowski, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, countered that the $9 billion figure should be the net amount raised, because $2 billion in revenue losses are already written into tax provisions in bills passed by both the House and the Senate Finance Committee.    Rep. Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said he wouldn't agree to giving President Reagan approval over each item in whatever tax bill is negotiated, as the White House has indicated it wants. &quot;I object to the president having a line-item veto on this,&quot; he said.    Mr. Rostenkowski reiterated that the House and Senate tax bills should be the starting point and their provisions the &quot;preference items,&quot; rather than any new proposals. Starting over on a tax bill without focusing on the existing tax legislation &quot;is a little bit repulsive to me,&quot; he added.    Both House and Senate Finance Committee versions hit corporations the hardest with higher taxes. One provision in both bills that the Reagan administration wants dropped is the repeal of a big tax break for defense contractors. Both versions would do away with the completed-contract method of accounting used by defense and other long-term contractors to defer income taxes. Rep. Rostenkowski said he wants to see that repealed in any tax bill &quot;and that's what they (the White House) want out.&quot;    The Gramm-Rudman law imposes an across-the-board reduction of $23 billion in the $1 trillion federal budget. Half of that amount would come from military programs, half from nonmilitary programs.    But because a number of large social entitlement programs, including Social Security and those aiding the poor, are protected by the law, only about 20% of the federal budget would be affected. Further, the cuts would be proportionately larger on military programs, which would be reduced by an average of 10.5%, than on nonmilitary programs, which would be cut by an average of 8.5%.    Today's cuts shouldn't have an immediate effect on most federal programs, though, because departments and agencies, anticipating a possible implementation of the cuts, have already adjusted their spending to meet the Gramm-Rudman law's lower levels.    But some entitlement programs, such as dairy price supports and Medicare payments, would be hit more quickly.    ---   Ellen Hume and Monica Langley contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
