Bruce G. Sundlun signed into lawa measure to bail out state-chartered credit unions and otherbanking institutions that were closed last month due to thecollapse of their private deposit insurer.   The law creates a new state agency, the DepositorsEconomic Protection Corp., to liquidate assets of the closedinstitutions whose deposits weren't covered by federalinsurers and to make refunds to the institutions' depositors.</LP><TEXT>   On Jan. 1, Gov. Sundlun closed 45 credit unions and banksa few hours after he was sworn in as governor. Deposits ofmost of the institutions were covered by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. or the National Credit Union Administration.   Deposits of 14 of the institutions, totaling $1.3 billion,weren't covered by federal insurance. Of those, some may beacquired, said a spokeswoman for the governor. The rest willbe liquidated by the new agency.   The law specifies that liquidated institutions' depositorswill get back all of their money up to $100,000, thespokeswoman said. For each additional increment of $100,000in an account up to $500,000, an additional 10% will be cutfrom the refund. Half of amounts over $500,000 will berefunded. The first payouts under the program will be madewithin two months, and subsequent payments will be made atsix-month intervals.   The initial payouts will be financed by a $150 millionbond issue, the spokeswoman said. The state will pay off thebond by keeping its sales tax at 7%, instead of lowering itto 6.5% in July, as had been planned. Additional payouts willbe financed by the sale of the failed institutions' assets,she added.</TEXT></DOC>
