On Oct. 1, Canadian fisheries officials fired a .50-calibermachine gun across the bow of a New Bedford scalloper, the DonnaLynn, and chased it for six hours before giving up 85 miles east ofNantucket.   The vessel has yet to return to port, but Canada has asked theU.S. State Department to investigate and press charges against thevessel's skipper.   The conflict goes back to 1984 when the World Court divided upthe thousands of miles of the Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine.When the court was through, the United States had fishing rights intwo-thirds of the area. But the 9,000 square miles that went toCanada turned out to have the lion's share of the fish.   For about three years, Canadian officials simply gave chase whenthey found American vessels where they didn't belong. Late lastyear they decided to crack down, arming patrol boats with machineguns and threatening to disable vessels if necessary.   ``We've been very careful to be sure that all these steps arewell known to the whole fishing industry. Obviously there are verycontrolled sets of procedures in place, which may result in anarmed boarding _ very similar to those your Coast Guard uses,''said Peter Flewwelling, chief of surveillance and enforcement forthe Canadian federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans.   ``There are many sensitivities that come to play, and soconsequently there is due concern,'' Flewwelling said in atelephone interview from Ottawa.   U.S. policy is to neither assist nor interfere in Canadian lawenforcement.   ``Of course it is of concern,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. TerryHart, chief of law enforcement for the Northeast district. Morethan 11,000 U.S. fishing vessels are licensed to work in hisdistrict, which runs from New Jersey to the Canadian border.   ``We are always concerned about the safety of life at sea. Weput out a release last winter notifying (the U.S. fishing fleet)that this is what the Canadians intend to do.''   The Coast Guard even plies Canadian water to find U.S.offenders, Hart said.   ``We go on the Canadian side. If we find U.S. vessels, wedocument the violation. We tell them they are in violation andtaking a risk,'' he said.   Hart said he knows of no Canadian vessels fishing where theydon't belong. ``We've never seen any over there. And probably for avery good reason: there's better fishing on their side of theline.''   If penalized in this country, violators risk loss of their boat,a year in jail and up to $10,000 fine.   The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and Coast Guard plansto board the Donna Lynn when it returns to port, he said.Information gathered then and the Canadian allegations will bedelivered to a federal magistrate for possible prosecution.   This month's incident was the second in three months.   In July, the Mary Elizabeth, a New Bedford dragger, was seizedand the captain arrested after Canadian authorities claimed theboat was fishing in Canadian water. The captain and crew denied thecharges, insisting they were illegally boarded and were fishing ininternational water.   The Donna Lynn allegedly was discovered three nautical milesinside Canadian water.</TEXT></DOC>
