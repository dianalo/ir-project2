<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0442 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the previous papers in this series the effect of the anode-cathodedistance (ACD) on the current efficiency (CE) was studied in laboratorycells with various types of stirring in the bath and at the bath-metalinterface. The purpose of the present laboratory study was to study thebehaviour at short ACD's of a solid wettable TiB/sub 2/ cathode comparedto a liquid aluminium cathode. Therefore, experiments were conductedwith a liquid aluminium cathode as well as with a solid wettable TiB/sub2/ cathode under as identical conditions as possible.</TEXT></DOC>
