For all of 1988, construction was begun on 9 percent fewerdwelling units than in 1987, F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-HillInformation Services Co. said. Housing starts declined 14 percent in1987 from 1986.   ``The stability of single-family home building over the past fewyears stands in sharp contrast to the virtual collapse of apartmentconstruction,'' George A. Christie, chief economist of F.W. Dodge,said in a written statement.   Single-family home construction fell 7 percent over the two yearsfrom 1986 to 1988, to 1.01 million units, while multi-familydwelling construction plummeted 41 percent to 448,000 units over thesame period, Christie said.   Housing starts reached their peak of the decade at 1.85 millionunits in 1986 before falling to 1.59 million in 1987 and 1.46million in 1988.   Apartment construction was stimulated beyond demand by taxincentives in the mid-1980s and vacancies remain high, Christie said.   Construction of one-family houses has remained stable at 1million to 1.1 million a year for the past three years, he said.   This year, higher interest rates should hurt the single-familyhousing market more than the apartment market, he said.   The California housing market was stimulated in 1988 bydevelopers' rushing to beat no-growth initiatives on the stateballot, Christie said. The initiatives were defeated.   Leading the nation in housing starts in the fourth quarter wasthe Los Angeles-Long Beach are, at 10,473 units, up 2 percent overthe 1987 fourth quarter.   Rounding out the top 10 were Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.,9,449, up 15 percent; Atlanta, 9,316 units, down 3 percent;Washington, 9,306, down 27 percent; Philadelphia, 6,072, down 1percent; Chicago, 6,058, up 7 percent; Las Vegas, 5,469, up 115percent; Seattle, 5,467, down 19 percent; West Palm Beach-BocaRaton-Delray Beach, Fla., 5,442, up 19 percent; and Detroit, 5,134,down 2 percent.
