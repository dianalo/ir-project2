Larry Blythe told a special Senate investigating subcommitteethat his 2-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son were raped in 1984on the reservation in western North Carolina.   He said trials were held and the abusers convicted, but theirlife sentences were overturned on appeal because the prosecutors hadused a state law to obtain the convictions.   State laws do not apply to crimes on Indian reservations.   In a second trial, prosecutors searched the federal statutes forlanguage that referred to the rapes and could not find wording thatapplied to such a crime against a boy.   The defendant pleaded guilty last spring to assault causingbodily harm and got a 10-year sentence, Blythe said.   He said federal statutes have since been amended for cases likehis children's but similar loopholes could exist for other types ofcrimes.   ``I'd like to see them pass a law that the (federal) act affectsany crime on the reservations,'' he said.   On Tuesday an FBI agent testified that child molesters gravitateto Indian reservation schools because background checks are lax andthere are no laws requiring officials to report suspected cases ofsex abuse.   David Small, supervisory special agent in Phoenix, told the panelthat molesters also seek teaching jobs on reservations because they``usually are in remote areas, making it easy to prey on children.''   Earlier Tuesday, a former teacher testified in a video tape thathe molested boys at the Cherokee Elementary School in western NorthCarolina for 14 years before being caught.   The teacher, Paul Wade Price, is serving a 10-year sentence atButner Federal Correctional Institution after pleading guilty in1986 to one count of child molestation. In the taped interview, hesaid he molested at least 25 boys, ages 8 to 12.   Congress in 1974 passed a law saying states would lose federalfunds if they did not enact statutes making it a crime to withholdinformation about suspected child sex abuse in schools. But statelaw does not apply to Indian reservations, where BIA schools aretotally federally financed. The federal government lacks such a law.   Child sex abuse on reservations is the topic of hearings thisweek by a special unit of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs, which also has been looking into corruption in Indiancontracting procedures and organized crime involvement in gamingoperations on reservations.   After hearing from Price and two mothers whose sons were molestedby him, the committee listened to eight witnesses from lawenforcement agencies and the Indian Affairs bureau who all said thefederal government should pass a law requiring that cases ofsuspected child sex abuse be reported.   Witnesses from the BIA said that despite a new policy requiringschool personnel to report cases of sex abuse, the BIA does not getmuch information. William Mehojah, BIA branch chief for Indianelementary and secondary school programs, said no disciplinaryaction has ever been taken for failure to report.   Robert Haley, general chairman of the Indian law enforcementsection of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, saidinvestigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by therefusal of tribes to let the children off the reservation to testify.   He said U.S. attorneys should be given the power to get thetestimony.   Mehojah said many teachers have gone to work before backgroundchecks were complete because of paperwork delays.   Other testimony indicated that even when schools are warned aboutthe history of a potential teacher, that teacher may get hiredanyway.   Arthur Justice, dean of education at the University of SouthCarolina-Spartanburg, testified that he had been instrumental inremoving Price as a seventh grade teacher in 1972 from anotherschool and had warned the Cherokee school officials about him, but14 years passed before Price was removed.   Ollie Locust, a teacher's aide at Cherokee elementary, said shesaw Price fondling a boy in the hallway and told the schoolprincipal, but nothing was done.   Teacher Betty Brintnall and Ms. Locust said it was commonknowledge around the school that Price had a penchant for youngboys, but no action was taken until a mother complained.   Agent Small said he knew of other cases in which Indian schooladministrators knew that a teacher had been molesting students, butwould not tell the next school system that hired him.   ``It's an easy out,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., whochairs the special investigative committee. ``Let the personresign.''   ``I never have seen a more clear failure of governmentresponsibility to U.S. citizens than we have seen in the last fewdays,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a committee member. ``Whatis so tragic in this case is that they are little children.''</TEXT></DOC>
