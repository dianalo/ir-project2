Sandamp;P also affirmed the triple-B-plus senior debt rating of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. and the A-2 commercial paper rating of J.I. Case Credit Corp. Both companies are units of the new Tenneco, which under a previously announced reorganization became the parent of the company that was formerly known as Tenneco Inc.    Tenneco declined comment on the rating action.    Tenneco has about $6.4 billion of long-term debt. Ratings on the new holding company are lower than on its units, Sandamp;P said, because creditors of the parent have less protection available given the &quot;substantial&quot; debt outstanding at the units.    Sandamp;P said Tenneco continues to be burdened with high levels of debt in a depressed energy pricing environment. The agency also said that maintenance of existing ratings is dependent on &quot;meaningful near-term debt reduction.&quot; Sales of assets or equity will be necessary to stave off a downgrade because of cash-flow problems, Sandamp;P warned. </TEXT></DOC>
