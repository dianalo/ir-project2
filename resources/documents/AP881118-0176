Runcie's office said he wrote it after being ``impressed'' bywhat Cardinal Basil Hume, Catholic archbishop of Westminster, toldhim about the cases.   Hume said Thursday he asked for the cases to be reopened at ameeting with Hurd. Hume was accompanied by four former top officialsof the judicial system who expressed doubt about the convictions.   The archbishops said evidence pointing to the innocence of thefour was never put to the jury; that convictions were based solelyon confessions that could have been induced by beatings and drugs;and that two IRA men convicted in another case, Joe O'Connell andBrendon Dowd, claimed they carried out the bombings and had neverheard of the other four.   Hurd's office said he was considering the pleas and was unlikelyto decide before Christmas.   The bombings at three pubs frequented by soldiers killed sevenpeople and injured 134 in 1974. Two pubs were in Guildford, 30 milessouthwest of London, and one in Woolwich, east London.   Carole Richardson, 29, Patrick Armstrong, 36, Paul Hill, 34, andGerry Conlon, 33, who still protest their innocence, were jailed forlife in 1975 for the Guildford bombings and Hill and Armstrong alsofor the Woolwich blast.   The outlawed Irish Republican Army has said it has bombed targetsin mainland Britain as well as Northern Ireland, where it isfighting to end British rule. </TEXT></DOC>
