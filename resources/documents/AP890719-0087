He was right not to go too far _ offering relatively modest aidwhile pledging support andchallenging Poles to begin transformingtheir country with patience, courage, ingenuity and sacrifice.   A key to his six-point package is a $100 million ``enterprisefund'' to support Polish entrepreneurs.   That kind of ecomonic incentive, plus all the symbolic support wecan offer, will help to reinforce the will of the Polish people tobreak away from the hopelessness of communism and begin to forgetheir own destiny.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 15   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on the Sandamp;L crisis:   Every day that passes without a bailout of the $150 billionsavings and loan mess is another $10 million in losses for which wemust pay.   Congress has allowed more $10 million days to pass than it shouldhave without acting on President Bush's rescue plan. It should agreequickly on a plan, get the bailout going, and close down ailing Sandamp;Lsbefore they lose more money. ...   Bush did well in drafting his bailout. But each house madechanges _ some good, some bad. ...   (The congressional conference committee) should accept theHouse's recommendation that the taxpayers' portion of the bill bepaid out of the general budget instead of through a separate bondsale by an independent agency.   The House plan means increasing the deficit by $44 billion duringthree years, but it would save billions of dollars in interestpayments.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 14   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on attempts to balance the budget:   Just because President Bush vowed back when he was candidate Bushthat the words ``new taxes'' would never cross his lips, Congress islooking for new ways to raise money that don't look like taxes.   So our nation's leaders ponder hikes in the tax on tobacco andsnuff while discarding the idea of raising cigarette taxes. Andlawmakers look at repealing a tax break on employee stock ownershipplans, but won't consider hiking the gasoline tax.   If the important task of moving toward a balanced budget requiresnew income, members of Congress and George ``no new taxes'' Bushshould consider all possible sources _ not just those that pass theduck test (if it looks like a duck, it's a duck; if it looks like atax, it's a tax).   But we have an even better idea before Congress and the executivebranch leap upon the back of some poor revenue source that doesn'tlook like a tax-collecting duck. Why not try cutting spending first?</TEXT><TEXT>   July 14   Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail on the U.S. Supreme Court:   The founding fathers never intended that the Supreme Court wouldbe the branch of government that made everything right. The court isintended only to be the last resort on interpretation of law.   The most important law the court must interpret is theConstitution. Yet, even in fulfilling that function, it is not theduty of the court to nail new amendments onto the Constitutionsimply because wise men and women think they are needed to achievejustice.   It is true that in interpreting the law, justices have somelatitude to construe the law broadly or narrowly. But, essentially,the duties of the court are technical, relying on the legalscholarship to come to an informed, lawyerly judgment about what thelaw, enacted by others, means when applied in very specific cases.   The recent decisions of the Supreme Court suggest to us that thecourt is groping to return to the original function envisioned forthat body by the founding fathers.   Legislative bodies made up of elected officials, not the court,are supposed to make laws. But if the laws are within thepermissible bounds defined by the Constitution, narrowlyinterpreted, the Supreme Court seems to be saying that it will notthrow out even stupid laws.   After all, democracy requires that voters who elect stupidlegislators should live with the results.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
