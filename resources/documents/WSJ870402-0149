Father Anselm, the monastery's business manager, doesn't go quite that far. But he feels no threat of foreign competition now that the European Court of Justice has struck down West Germany's &quot;purity&quot; laws that had kept out imports.    &quot;To be honest, I really haven't given foreign beer much thought, because we would hardly be affected,&quot; says the 33-year-old monk, his black skirts billowing as he hurries across the cobbled courtyard in squeaking rubber-soled shoes.    Imbibing beer made beyond Germany's borders is out of the question for Ulrich Schulenberger, an elderly patron who has come from Munich on a recent sunny day to the monastery's 4,000-seat beer hall. &quot;They can bring in anything they want. Certainly no Bavarian would drink a beer from northern Germany, much less a foreign beer,&quot; Mr. Schulenberger snorts. &quot;They are full of soybeans and chemicals.    &quot;Now this,&quot; he declares, hoisting a tankard of Andechser, &quot;is purity. You can't get this anywhere else in the world.&quot;    His mug comes crashing down on the wooden table amid sounds of approval from his neighbors. A Frau Trepps, seated nearby with her own tankard, argues that the fewer additives in a beer, the better it is for expectant mothers. Another man, munching a snack of raw turnips and boiled eggs, says over a sudden burst of song nearby that he has been coming to Andechs for 35 years and will continue &quot;for as long as I can still walk.&quot;    By midafternoon the beer hall is packed to overflowing. Hundreds take their tankards and pretzels outside to the courtyard in the shadow of the Gothic church, apparently impervious to the approaching evening chill.    Most visitors come on the train from Munich. It deposits them at the town of Herrsching, which has prospered along with the monastery. Some walk up the mountain by skirting a lake and cutting through forest and fields.    &quot;On warm days, you know when the train has arrived because there is always a procession down the street headed for Andechs,&quot; says Dieter Koehler, manager of the Andechser Hof hotel. Foreigners -- from Japanese to Hessians -- usually come by the busload, he says.    For the community, business booms when the monastery closes at 8 p.m. -- especially at Mr. Koehler's hotel, which has the monks' beer on tap in its beer hall. &quot;Then whole crowds come down the mountain and fall in here, usually already half blasted and looking for one more round before heading home,&quot; he says.    Benedictine monks have brewed beer at the monastery since it was built in 1455 atop the Holy Mountain, named for the religious relics discovered in a ruined castle. They served it to pilgrims.    &quot;Don't forget, those were the days before lemonade and cola,&quot; says Father Anselm. &quot;A mixture of faith, brewing and beer drinking has always gone well together in a monastery -- in the right doses, of course.&quot;    The monk doesn't dispute reports of immoderate consumption of the potent Andechser beer, which comes in two varieties, pale ale and a dark double-bock. &quot;For us beer is liquid bread; for others it is something more,&quot; he says happily.    Despite the flood of guests, the monastery's newly modernized brewery has never run out of beer. But one day last year, the staff thought they might come close. Several hundred Australians and New Zealanders invaded the monastery's taproom en masse, apparently for a warmup session before Munich's Oktoberfest, which was to open the next day.    &quot;Things began getting a bit rowdy, and we just didn't know what to do,&quot; Father Anselm recalls with an indulgent smile. &quot;After we couldn't persuade them to leave, we finally got the police to load them into buses to take them back to Munich.&quot;    But while sobriety isn't the rule of the day in the beer hall, disturbances are rare. And when he isn't pressed with keeping the monastery solvent or baptizing infants, Father Anselm may pass a few hours sitting among the guests to set, in a subtle way, a Christian example. &quot;But then again,&quot; he says, lighting up, &quot;being a Christian doesn't always mean walking around with a dour face.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
