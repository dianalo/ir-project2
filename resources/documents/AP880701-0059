Organizers said the Arab-Israeli conflict, including theseven-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, wouldbe a key theme throughout the 10-day event.   ``We wanted to show our concern and also place the festival in ahistorical context,'' said festival spokeswoman Yael Munk,explaining the selection.   The festival was launched Thursday night with the documentary``Walls'' about the effects of the uprising on Arab and Jewishresidents of Jerusalem and the short feature ``Dissolves'' aboutthe experiences of a young Israeli soldier in the West Bank.   ``Walls,'' a collage of news footage and emotionally chargedinterviews, shows how the uprising has further raised the barriersof hatred and suspicion between Arabs and Jews in the disputed city.   A Jewish slum resident tells film maker, Uri Goldstein, that hewould kill all Arabs if he were prime minister.   On the other side of town, a Palestinian says that while hestill judges Jews on an individual basis, his children fear allJews and the words ``Jew'' and ``soldier'' have become synonymous.   Another Jewish resident interviewed in the film says thesuffering of the Palestinians is nothing compared to what the Jewshave gone through in their 2,000-year history. Counters aPalestinian: ``This is not a competition in suffering.''   As an illustration, Goldstein shows a little girl playing on thegravestone of two Israeli children killed after a bomb planted byPalestinian guerrillas exploded on an Israeli bus.   A few yards down the road, Palestinian teen-agers gather aroundthe grave of their friend who was killed in the uprising.   The feature ``Dissolves'' tells the story of Gai, a sensitive18-year-old from a liberal home who, fresh out of basic training,is sent to the occupied West Bank.   In the first scene, a dream sequence, Gai is chasing a youngArab stone-thrower up a hill. When he finally catches up with thestone-thrower, Gai stands frozen because he sees that the boy haswet himself in fear. Nearby, Gai's right-wing comrade beats anotheryoung Arab who shouts ``not in the face, not in the face.''   In another scene, Gai's unit enounters Arab stone-throwers andone of his comrades is struck in the head by a large brick thrownfrom a roof. Gai chases the assailant, pulls him to the ground andin a furious rage thrashes him with his rifle until he is pulledoff by two other soldiers.   In the final episode, Gai returns home and tells his father, whohas spent many sleepless nights worrying about his son, that he haskilled an Arab woman.   Other festival films dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict are``Shattered Dreams'' which tackles the theme from the point of viewof an Israeli in exile, and ``The Children of Dheishe,'' adocumentary about a kindergarten in a West Bank refugee camp.   The festival, which was founded in 1984, offers 130 films from39 countries, including a retrospective of films by U.S. directorFrank Capra.   Ms. Munk said organizers received some cancellations, but thatno one turned down invitations for political reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
