New Hampshire, the most frugal state in the union, the state that boasts the lowest taxes, one of only two states without either a general income or sales tax, is debating -- shock] -- new taxes.    In a move that has some New Hampshirites apoplectic, several legislators plan to introduce income tax or sales tax bills come next year. And even though they insist that any new tax would only be used to lower soaring property taxes, the idea has the state's penny-pinching residents clutching their wallets.    Taxes have become the hottest topic on radio talk shows. The Manchester Union Leader -- the conservative newspaper that is one of the state's major political forces -- has declared war. &quot;They're all a bunch of hypocrites to sit there and say, 'We don't want any more money,'&quot; says Joseph McQuaid, editor of the Union Leader, echoing the rhetoric of the paper's late publisher, William Loeb. &quot;They will smile and lie through their teeth.&quot;    &quot;Stoneheads,&quot; retorts Rep. Bert Teague, a Concord Republican who will introduce a 5% income tax. An income tax is fairer than a property tax, he argues: &quot;I want to shift the burden from those least able to pay to those most able to pay.&quot;    But Rep. Teague and other income-tax proponents concede that they face an uphill battle with fellow citizens. Not only are New Hampshirites cheap, they're proud of it. &quot;We're a little bit tight, wisely so,&quot; says Donald Collins, an optician in Manchester who fled Taxachusetts -- as folks here call the state to the south -- 11 years ago.    The state's residents are quintessential Yankees: independent, thrifty and skeptical. &quot;New Hampshire still represents distrust of central authority,&quot; explains Jere Daniell, a history professor at Dartmouth College. &quot;Opposition to an income tax isn't so much opposition to that as a form of taxation, but reluctance to give the state sources of income to allow it to do what they see in New York and California and Taxachusetts.&quot; Past attempts to pass a state income tax have failed, often by wide margins, thanks in no small part to the Union Leader. Since at least the late 1960s, any politician aspiring to higher office than county dogcatcher has had to take The Pledge -- a vow against a state income or general sales tax that is demanded by the Union Leader before the paper will even consider an endorsement. Voters, Mr. McQuaid notes gleefully, &quot;have clobbered any {gubernatorial} candidate who wouldn't take the pledge.&quot;    Instead, New Hampshire relies largely on property taxes to finance local government and a hodgepodge of taxes to run the state. Some taxes, like the room and meals tax and the liquor tax -- much of which is collected at huge state-run liquor stores on interstate highways near its borders -- are designed in part to bring in as much money as possible from nonresidents. &quot;We have a way of relying on tourists and outsiders for paying for New Hampshire,&quot; says Mr. Daniell.    New Hampshire does have a business profits tax, and a tax on dividend and interest income. But property taxes account for about two-thirds of all state and local revenue, and have been rising 20% or more a year in some communities. While overall taxes as a percentage of personal income are the lowest in the nation, property taxes are among the highest.    Cities and towns have had to increase property taxes to pay for things that Concord -- unlike other state capitals -- won't. State aid to schools, for example, is the lowest in the nation. Services are among the sparest of any state, and slower economic growth has squeezed budgets further in the past six months.    &quot;We're ending up literally now with people having to sell their homes because they can't pay the property tax bill,&quot; says Rep. Douglas Hall, a Republican who will propose a 3.5% income tax during the next session. His bill will provide for &quot;dollar for dollar&quot; property tax relief.    To get that point across, Rep. Hall says, &quot;My bill won't be titled an income tax bill. It will be titled a property tax relief bill.&quot;    But skeptics abound -- starting with Republican Gov. Judd Greeg, a staunch opponent of the tax. &quot;If you believe that added taxes will reduce taxes,&quot; he said in a recent speech, &quot;I have some swampland I want to sell you.&quot;    And while many residents agree that property taxes are too high, they question whether an income tax is the solution to their problem. &quot;It'll be a wash, huh? Is that what {tax proponents} say?&quot; asks Robert L. Lavoie, a Manchester travel agent, arching his eyebrows. &quot;When they start these taxing programs, it starts a spending program.&quot;    The Union Leader -- which in the past referred to President Ford as &quot;Jerry the Jerk&quot; and President Eisenhower as &quot;Dopey Dwight&quot; -- isn't taking any chances. The paper's plan of attack: &quot;early and often,&quot; vows Mr. McQuaid. In addition to two editorials and two cartoons, the paper recently ran a package of stories lending support to its position. One described a 1982 study that showed states that adopt income taxes don't reduce property taxes. Another noted that a recently enacted income tax increase in Massachusetts may prompt more companies and workers to flee to New Hampshire.    With feelings so strong, even the state's Democrats -- who normally might be expected to support an income tax over the property tax -- don't want to have anything to do with it. Long the minority party in New Hampshire, they fear incurring the wrath of the voters.    &quot;The Republicans make the laws, and the laws that don't work out they somehow blame the Democrats for. It's like the Communists in Poland blaming Solidarity for the problems the country is facing,&quot; says Ramsay McLauchlan, executive director of the state Democratic party. &quot;So the party's position is that if the Republicans want a broad-based tax, let them get out in front.&quot;    Given the nature of New Hampshire, proponents aren't predicting victory any time soon. &quot;This will not happen fast,&quot; concedes Rep. Teague. &quot;But next session around it could go.&quot; Hardly, responds the Union Leader's Mr. McQuaid; the chances are &quot;slimmer than a snowball in hell.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
