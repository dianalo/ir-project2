Thefive-day walkout had had little effect on service.   The airline, which has a largely ununionized work force sinceTexas Air Corp. head Frank Lorenzo took Continental into bankruptcyproceedings in 1983, said that only a few attendants had taken partand that they had lost their jobs but have the right to fill futurejob openings.   The Union of Flight Attendants said its executive board ended thestrike, at 9 a.m. Union officials were notifying attendants toreport for their work assignments.   ``This strike accomplished the objectives we set out toachieve,'' Carla Winkler, union president, said in a statement.   ``We have been able to bring to the public's attention thedisparate treatment between the wages and working conditions ofContinental flight attendants and flight attendants at othercarriers in the industry.''   When the strike began, some of those on the picket line said itwas intended to last only 96 hours, a figure Winkler refused toconfirm.   Union leaders had said that the strike was largely unrelated tothe Machinists union walkout against sister Eastern Airlines,another brach of Texas Air. That strike, which began March 4,virtually shut down the airline when most Eastern pilots opted notto cross Machinists' picket lines.   At Continental, officials said 180 attendants refused to reportfor work during the job action and were replaced. The union said allweek that the number of strike participants was more like 1,000, andclaimed that some flights were canceled, but offered no proof.   The Houston-based airline lists its flight attendant work forceat 6,440.   ``We feel really good that we enjoyed the support of so many ofour flight attendants,'' airline spokesman Dave Messing said today.``Not a single cancellation occurred as a result of the unionactivity.   ``It (the strike) just didn't have the support needed to causedisruptions.''   Messing said the 180 strikers had been permanently replaced butwere subject to recall when job openings became available and wouldhave seniority over new applicants.</TEXT></DOC>
