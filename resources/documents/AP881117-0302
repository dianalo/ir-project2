The coordinated intervention in the currency markets by theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, England, France, Italy andCanada was the most widespread dollar rescue effort since last Aprilwhen the markets were stampeded into a dollar sell-off following abad monthly trade report.   Despite the success of Thursday's rescue effort, many tradersforesaw renewed selling pressure in the months ahead because offears that President-elect George Bush and the new Congress will beunable to reach agreement on ways to trim the budget deficit.   Investors are concerned that the enlarged Democratic majoritiesin Congress and Bush's tough no-tax stance guarantee furtherbudgetary gridlock.   For this reason, many economists predicted the Federal Reservewill be forced in coming weeks to begin pushing interest rateshigher in the United States. Some analysts said they would not ruleout an increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed chargesto make loans to member banks.   A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the Fedcan send of its intention of driving interest rates higher.   Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments moreattractive to foreigners and help relieve the pressure to sell offsuch assets. Higher interest rates also dampen inflationarypressures brought on by a weaker currency.   Intervention is the process by which the Federal Reserve or othercountries' central banks buy and sell currencies in an attempt toinfluence the market price.   The intervention Thursday was begun by the Bank of Japan, whichstarted buying dollars after the U.S. currency fell to near 40-yearlows in trading in Tokyo.   After the initial purchases by the Bank of Japan, currencytraders reported that the central banks of the major European alliesof the United States bought dollars, followed by buying by the U.S.central bank.   The concerted dollar-buying helped to push the U.S. currency upto 122.155 yen at the close of trading in New York, off slightlyfrom Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen. It had closed at 121.52 yen inTokyo, after having dropped as low as 121.30 during the Tokyotrading day.   But traders said they doubted the joint intervention effort wouldhave more than a temporary restaining effect on the downwardpressure on the dollar.   ``This will only provide temporary relief,'' said William Hand, atrader at First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia. ``The marketwants to see some concrete kind of plan on how the budget deficit isgoing to be solved.''   Robert Hormats, an economist with Goldman, Sachs, predicted thatthe currency markets and the stock and bond markets would continueto be in turmoil between now and Bush's inauguration on Jan. 20.   ``I think the market has confidence in the economic team Bush isputting together, but the market is impatient because the budget andtrade imbalances are so big,'' he said.   Market unrest already has prompted Bush and Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady, who will stay on in the Bush administration, toissue reassuring statements that the new administration considerscutting the budget deficit to be a top priority.   On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added thestrongest voice yet to calls for urgent action on the deficit,telling the National Economic Commission that the deficit, whichclimbed to $155.1 billion in the last fiscal year, ``already hasbegun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength.''   However, Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate, asked about Greenspan'swarning, said, ``Economists never agree on anything. For everyeconomist you cite we can trot out one who is diametrically inopposition.''   David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc.,called Tate's remarks on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''surprising, given the need for the new administration to present aunited front with the central bank to reassure jittery markets.   ``The market right now is looking for some reassurance thatsomething is going to be done about the federal budget deficit andabout the trade deficit,'' Wyss said. ``They are afraid that theBush administration is more willing to solve the deficit by lettingthe dollar fall than by cutting the budget deficit.''   While a weaker dollar makes U.S. goods less expensive on overseasmarkets and imports more expensive for Americans, Bush has insistedthat he does not plan to abandon the two-year Reagan effort tostabilize the dollar's value.   Wyss said that with the uncertainty in currency markets, the Fedsoon will start pushing interest rates higher.   ``I think the Fed will have to let interest rates edge upward,''he said, predicting that tighter monetary policy could trigger anincrease in banks' prime lending rate by next month.   Lyle Gramley, a former member of the Fed board and now chiefeconomist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said the central bankwas likely to make behind-the-scenes moves to nudge rates higher incoming weeks but would wait until January for something as dramaticas a boost in the discount rate, unless the dollar threatened totumble into a free-fall.   ``They would like to wait before tightening further, but theexchange markets may force the Fed's hand,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
