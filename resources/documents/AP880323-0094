G.D. Searle andamp; Co. is being sued by women who claim use of theintrauterine device caused them to develop pelvic infections.   A lawyer for one of the plaintiffs contends court documentsindicate an attempt to conceal known health threats from the U.S.Food and Drug Administration. The papers were unsealed by a judge'sorder.   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said Tuesday that investigators metwith Searle officials March 16 to go over the documents.   ``The FDA has not had any reason to withdraw approval of theCopper-7 IUD,'' she said, adding that could be the ultimate penaltyif the FDA determined the company did misrepresent the product.   Cruzan said the FDA will continue to review documents that areunsealed in the case brought by Esther Kociemba of Melrose, whoclaims that the Copper-7 made her infertile.   Her attorney, Michael Ciresi of Minneapolis, has said theunsealed documents ``will collectively establish without a doubtthat the Copper-7 causes (infection) and Searle knew about it butdid not disclose it to doctors or to women.''   Ciresi said Tuesday he could not comment on Cruzan's initialassessment because he does not know which documents the FDAreviewed.   Mrs. Kociemba's case against Searle is scheduled to go to trialMay 16 in federal court in St. Paul.   The Copper-7 was approved for public use in 1974. From thenuntil 1986, when Searle withdrew it from the market because ofmounting litigation costs, it was the most popular IUD in theUnited States. Searle recently resumed manufacturing the device tofill foreign orders.   Searle, which maintains that the device is safe, has won 14 ofthe 17 cases that have gone to court and says it has settledseveral hundred out of court.   Searle is a unit of Monsanto Co. of St. Louis.</TEXT></DOC>
