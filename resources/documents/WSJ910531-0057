In Tokyo yesterday morning Nissan announced it haddeveloped a new catalytic converter that uses palladiuminstead of platinum and rhodium to reduce automobilepollution emissions.</LP><TEXT>   The news set off a mad scramble in futures markets aroundthe globe. Investors holding contracts for future delivery ofplatinum tried to bail out just as speculators were rushingin to sell short in hopes of profiting from sinking prices.   Traders recalled that platinum fell $100 an ounce on Dec.15, 1988, when Ford Motor Co. announced a similardevelopment. However, platinum began that descent from aprice level more than 30% higher than it was on Wednesday.   But fearing a replay, traders yesterday quickly pushedprices down as much as they are allowed in one day on theTokyo Commodity Exchange, which amounted to a 4.3% drop.   The decline was steeper in London, where platinum istraded on a cash basis without any limits. At the Londonmarket's afternoon fix, platinum was at $365.75 an ounce,down $26.35, or 6.7%.   In New York, platinum futures for July delivery openeddown the $25-an-ounce daily limit and remained there most ofthe morning, effectively stifling trading. By afternoon,though, prices recovered a bit and trading resumed. The Julycontract ended at $376.70, down $20.50 an ounce or 5.2%.   Rhodium prices sank 16%. The ending bid for rhodiumyesterday was $3,100 an ounce, down from $3,700 Wednesday,according to Frank Reddon, manager of precious metals tradingin the Valley Forge, Pa., office of Johnson Matthey, aBritish precious metals concern. A month ago, rhodium wasabout $5,000 an ounce.   Meanwhile, September palladium futures jumped the$6-an-ounce daily limit on the New York Mercantile Exchangeto $99.75.   By using less-expensive palladium, a Nissan spokesman saidin Tokyo, the auto maker can reduce the cost of makingcatalytic converters -- &quot;unless the price of palladiumskyrockets.&quot; He declined to say when Nissan might beginproducing its new pollution-control device, saying it must betested &quot;in terms of durability and effectiveness.&quot;   But Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major Japanese economic dailynewspaper, said in an article Thursday that Nissan plans toput the device into use beginning in 1994. Production costswill be reduced to less than one-third of the conventionalconverters, the report said.   Ford said it has been producing light-duty to medium-dutytrucks with converters free of platinum and rhodium since the1988 model year. It also has been installing converters thatuse rhodium, but not platinum, in nine car lines.   Ford said it owns two patents and expects to receive twomore on a palladium-only catalyst that would be used in carsand light-duty trucks.   Toyota Motor Co. said in January 1989 it had developed asimilar device. But a Toyota spokesman said yesterday theconverter &quot;is not completely platinum-free&quot; and the companyhasn't set a date to begin producing the converter.   Before platinum trading opened in New York, all 12 phonesrang constantly at commodities trading firm World TradeFutures on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange,said Henry Terranova, a trader in the platinum pit. Ordersflowed in from Europe and Asia, as well as the U.S., frompanicked customers. &quot;Have you ever been in a gloomysituation, where the death knell had sounded?&quot; he said aboutthe mood around the pit just before the opening bell.   Jim Riley, head trader at J. Aron Currency andamp; Commoditiesdivision of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., was at home when he heardthe Nissan news. He and three traders rushed back to theirtrading room in lower Manhattan and worked the phones allnight. At dawn, they rented a hotel room to shower and shavebefore returning to work, where they expected to remain allnight again.   They initially traded in Tokyo, where the market held upwell until after lunch, which was around midnight in NewYork, Mr. Riley said. Then a frenzy hit and the marketplummeted. Futures trading locked at the limit, forcing themto trade in the cash market, which hit a low of about $355,down about 10% from Wednesday.   Even though futures prices in both Tokyo and New York werefrozen at their daily limits for much of the tradingsessions, volume in both markets was heavy. In Tokyo, morethan three times as many platinum contracts changed hands ason Wednesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, anestimated 9,393 platinum contracts traded, almost four timesthe daily average so far this year of 2,392. Palladium tradedan estimated 1,316 contracts, compared with an average of337.   Although Ford's 1988 announcement walloped the platinummarket, it disappeared as a market factor within a couple ofweeks. One reason was the small effect Ford's new converterhad on platinum use. The other reason was that Europeancountries were tightening their pollution-controlregulations, which in effect opened a new big market forplatinum.   Some people think the market reaction to the Nissanconverter also will fade fast because it is years away fromproduction and at first will be used only in &quot;mini&quot; cars inthe domestic Japanese market. As a result, says WilliamO'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, its impact onplatinum demand now is practically nil.   Even if the converter is adopted for wider use, it willprobably just supplement platinum- and rhodium-basedconverters, said Nina Lipton, research manager of thePlatinum Guild International, a trade association. U.S. andEuropean gasolines still contain lead and sulfur, which candestroy palladium, she explained.   Analysts and traders were hesitant to predict where priceswould go today. Mr. Riley of J. Aron noted that yesterdayplatinum found some support from investors who bought it andsold gold when the two metals' prices were about equal. Oilcompanies, which use platinum in petroleum refining, alsobought the metal yesterday, said Mr. Reddon of JohnsonMatthey.   Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with PaineWebber, predictedplatinum prices would stabilize between $360 and $370 duringthe next couple of days.   One beneficiary of yesterday's upheaval could be silver,said Mr. Riley. Investors betting on a rise in demand forindustrial metals as the U.S. economy recovers could switchto silver from platinum, he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: A small rally in gasoline contracts boosted crudeprices in technically oriented trading. There was little newsto move the market and many participants continued to avoidbig positions in advance of next week's meeting of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.Little is expected to occur at the meeting but traders wantto avoid exposure in case there are surprises. Gasoline forJune delivery settled at 68.31 cents a gallon, up 1.27 cents,on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The July crude contractadvanced 21 cents a barrel, to $21.32. Meanwhile, the boardof the New York Merc voted to temporarily suspend trading ofgasoline futures for September 1992 and beyond while itconsiders changes to the contract necessitated by revisionsin the Clean Air Act. The act will require changes ingasoline's oxygen content in certain areas that must meshwith state guidelines that haven't yet been developed orapproved. As a result the exchange isn't certain whatspecifications to use for the gasoline contract and is nowseeking public, government and industry comment.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Reports out of Washington on apossible Bush administration response to the Soviet Union'scredit requests whip-sawed grain futures prices. The U.S.S.R.has asked for an additional $1.5 billion in export bonuscredits, which would be used to buy U.S. grains. Futuresprices opened lower but rallied in late morning when the U.S.Agriculture Department summoned exporters and trade groupsfor a meeting with the agriculture secretary. Traders,assuming that the meeting might signal the administration'swillingness to grant the U.S.S.R. bonus credits, boughtfutures contracts to cover short positions. Later, however,the meeting was abruptly canceled, triggering a sell-off offutures contracts. The price of the corn contract for Julydelivery fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.4350 a bushel, while theprice of the July wheat contract declined 3 1/4 cents to$2.85 a bushel. Traders will be watching events in Washingtonagain today. A delegation from the Soviet Union is inWashington and is expected to meet with President Bush, as isa U.S. delegation that traveled to the U.S.S.R. to explorethe country's credit-worthiness.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell again. Copper for Julydelivery ended 1.55 cents a pound lower at 96.65 cents.William O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch,attributed the decline to heavy selling in London. The NewYork market followed London's lead and opened sharply lower.The sellers were rumored to be Japanese, he said. Demand forcopper has been very weak in the U.S., and there are someconcerns about the Japanese economy, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
