Department of Correction.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A BEHIND-THE-SCENE LOOK AT AN INTERESTING APPLICATION ENVIRONMENTandM;The receptionist was a burly man in blue.andP;  The nameplate on his desk readOfficer Regan.andP;  I'm here to see Cecil Clarke,&quot; I stated.andP;  &quot;I have an 11:00 AMappointment.&quot;andM;&quot;First door to the right,&quot; he pointed with a meaty thumb.andP;  I opened the heavysecurity door with a heave and moseyed my way in.andM;Mr.andP;  Clarke is the acting director of telecommunications for the New YorkCity Department of Correction.andP;  As such, he manages all telecom operationsfor the largest municipal prison system in the nation.andP;  His jurisdictionincludes Rikers Island, the city's main detention facility, as well as cellblocks in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and a few offshore prison barges.andM;Mr.andP;  Clarke took a couple of hours out of his busy workday to describetelecom behind bars in New York City.andP;  To help him out he called in CaptainVinnie Golden, supervisor of installation and maintenance at Rikers Island.andO;We also heard testimony from Victor Brown and Hank Heagle, project managersfor the department, and Julia Bowen, probably the most vigilant biningassociate in the country.andM;&quot;The Department of Correction maintains two types of telecom systems,&quot; Mr.andO;Clarke explained.andP;  &quot;The inmate system is for prisoner use.andP;  It furnishesthose telecom privileges which are mandated by law.andP;  Then there is theadministrative system.andP;  Aside from being the main telephone system for thedepartment, it is used for special prison applications - like inmateinformation, security alerts and taking roll call.&quot;andM;The inmate SystemandM;More than 60% of Rikers Island inmates are being held pending trial or otherdisposition of their cases.andP;  Since they have not been convicted, they havemost of the same rights as we do.andP;  Following a 1978 consent detainees areallowed one complete six-minute call per day.andP;  This does not include calls toattorneys.andM;Sentenced inmates have fewer telecom rights.andP;  They are allowed only two callsevery seven days.andP;  Inmates who have been relegated to punitive segregation,or solitary confinement, are limited to one call per week.andM;The NYC Department of Correction currently uses New York Tel Centrex fortheir inmate system.andP;  All lines are restricted for outbound use only.andO;Long-distance area codes, 900 numbers and the like are also barred.andM;Premises equipment is rather modest.andP;  Inmates use wall-mounted rotary dialsets - &quot;supplied by whoever gives us the lowest bid,&quot; Captain Golden remarks.andO;The phones are connected to a local operations booth via coded terminals,ground-start buttons and cutoff panels.andM;Officers in the control rooms provide access to dialtone.andP;  Electronic timersmonitor the length of each call and give inmates warning tones when they'realmost at their limit.andP;  If necessary, the timers will automatically cut callsin progress.andP;  The phones are available from seven in the morning to 11o'clock at night.andM;The Department has already drawn up specs for an Advanced Inmate CallManagement System (AICMS) to replace the present system.andP;  According to HankHeagle, project manager - &quot;AICMS will employ the latest in bar codetechnology.andP;  Many inmates wear bracelets for identification purposes.andP;  Wewill place the bar codes on similar bracelets.andP;  When someone wants to maketheir daffy call, they will simply bring their wrist up to the bar codereader and receive their six minutes of access.&quot; The relevant inmate datawill be housed in a central minicomputer, interacting dynamically with theAICMS system.andM;Also envisioned is a paid call system.andP;  Inmates will open accounts with theDepartment of Correction.andP;  They will be given the opportunity to make callsbeyond the New York metropolitan area, provided they have the funds to payfor it.andM;Prisoner Phone AbuseandM;Telecom managers are always complaining about employee phone abuse.andP;  How theyrack up exorbitant charges.andP;  How they maul their station sets.andP;  How they getaround loopholes in the system.andM;At Rikers Island, phone abuse has run rampant.andP;  According to Captain Golden,the Department repairs as many as 3,000 phones per year.andP;  And these are notfancy LCD phones falling off the tables either, but sturdy standby sets,securely mounted to the wall.andM;Historically, prisoners have found very innovative ways of liftingrestrictions on telecom access.andP;  &quot;Inmates used to take the handset, insertsome tin foil and rub it against the bars.andP;  They'd get a dialtone, gettingaround our ground-start safeguards,&quot; Captain Golden remarks.andP;  The Departmentclosed this loophole by installing electronic timer systems.andM;As noted, the Department installs ordy rotary phones in its inmate system.andO;Although it would take far less time to place calls on touchtone models,inmates could use this feature to make credit card calls or to call beepersthe telecom instrument of choice for drug dealers - on the outside.andM;Nevertheless, Captain Golden recalls an instance an officer caught an inmatewith an autodialer.andP;  &quot;It was one of those special LCD watches loaded witheverything,&quot; he recalls.andP;  &quot;The autodialer was but another value-addedfeature.andP;  Yet another reason to never underestimate the ingenuity of theseguys.&quot;andM;Inmates have also found a number of uses for their telephone system which arewholly unrelated to telecom.andP;  &quot;We run all of the cable leading to the phonesin protective conduit,&quot; Golden relates.andP;  &quot;There's always the temptation touse the twisted pair wire to scale down the prison walls.&quot;andM;Inmates have also discovered that the 2500 set volume adjust - a longhorizontal bar on the back - makes an excellent shiv, when sharpened up abit.andP;  Inmate telephones have also been used to store contraband like weapons.andO;The handset, of course, makes an excellent makeshift bludgeon.andM;Billing abuse carries its own share of headaches.andP;  julia Bowen, billingassociate for the Department, says she disputes bills on a daily basis.andP;  &quot;NewYork Tel has to lift its restrictions to repair our Centrex lines.andP;  Quiteoften, the repairman forgets to put them back in place when they're finished.andM;&quot;When New York Tel makes a mistake, it doesn't take very long for a wholecell block to find out about it.&quot; The result are scores of unauthorizedcalls, made all over the country and overseas.andM;Julia has encountered few problems straightening out these discrepancies withNew York Tel.andP;  Look,&quot; she says, &quot;they proposed this restricted service to us,we pay for it, and if they've faded to keep it in place, well, they're goingto absorb the cost.&quot;andM;The Administrative SystemandM;Currently, the Department of Correction administrative system is built arounda central ATandamp;T 701 switching network, housed on Rikers Island.andP;  Althoughrather advanced for its day, ATandamp;T 701 technology is now nearly 50 years old.andO;ATandamp;T hasn't supported it for decades.andP;  The Department will replace it with anew switching system beginning in fiscal year 1991.andM;The central switchboard at Rikers Island, managed by Ms.andP;  Carole Howard, isopen 24 hours per day, seven days per week.andP;  A basic tour consists of fourswitchboard operators, two inmate information operators, one telephone repairsupervisor/administrator, one administrative staff member and one toursupervisor.andP;  Inmate information operators locate inmates for friends andrelatives, via a computerized system, backed up by a manual database look-up.andM;The Rikers Island system harbors a number of specialized security features.andO;Hot phones, scattered throughout the island, have emergency conferencecapabilities.andP;  All call activity taking place on those phones win besuperseded by an emergency conference.andP;  The housing area conference - afuture innovation - will be used in more placid times, for roll call andother routine matters of population control.andM;And, of course, the 701 plant can also make tie-line calls, outgoing callsand general internal business transmissions.andM;Already, the Department has begun overhauling its antiquated telecom plant.andO;The Queens, Brooklyn and floating jails have already been fortified withHarris/Executone D1000 prison systems - state of the art prison switches.andM;Cecil Clarke, now acting director of telecommunications, worked over eightmonths on an RFP for a replacement for the 701.andP;  Dubbed the Rikers IslandMaster Project, the new equipment will be able to take on ISDN, SystemSignalling 7, video conferencing and some new security features, as well assimultaneous voice and data over copper cable.andP;  It will employ a ring/starhybrid design and will be connected to remote facilities via a redundantfiber optic network.andM;According to Victor Brown, the current project manager for the MasterProject, the new system will incorporate a sophisticated MIS system.andP;  Avariety of interactive modules will be able to manage the cable plant, locatesystem failures and monitor alarms on and off Rikers Island, among othercapabilities.&quot;andM;The system will also be able to print an up-to-date directory for the entireDepartment of Correction.andP;  A tieline network will allow you to dial four toseven digit numbers to place remote calls from the telecom lines on RikersIsland.andM;To bid on this lucrative contract, vendors had to send representatives toRikers Island.andP;  They were frisked, searched and subjected to other securitymeasures before they were escorted through the complex.andM;The reps were at the complex for two weeks - from as early as 8 AM to 5 PM.andO;Correction personnel led them through technical site walkthroughs.andP;  Theywalked through all institutions at Rikers, and had the opportunity to inspectcable and conduit routes.andM;The Department will soon select a vendor for the project.andP;  When finished itwill accommodate 5,000 lines, with prodigious expansion capabilities.andP;  Anentirely new building is now being erected at Rikers Island to house thetelecommunication division staff, a major central node and a network controlcenter for the department.andM;I had already taken up too much of the Department's time.andM;I thanked the gentlemen for their time.andP;  On my way out, I also thankedOfficer Regan.andP;  He didn't answer - just pointed his meaty thumb in thedirection of the elevator.andM;Rolm's Phon*Mail  The Right Choice For News Hounds and Underworld StooliesandM;When the Pinellas County, Florida sheriff's department installed their newRolm system they expected some improvements in productivity.andP;  Theirexpectations were met in both obvious and unforeseeable ways.andP;  Of course, itwas only natural that routine tasks like direct dialing would be markedlyimproved.andP;  And so they were.andM;What the department did not anticipate was that Rolm's PhoneMail voicemessaging system would have an enormous appeal to confidential informants andthe news media.andP;  It did.andP;  PhoneMail has become the stoolie's and news hound'smedium of choice for contacting the Pinellas County sheriff's office.andP;  MajorRobert Schutte, commander of the Judicial Operations Bureau, notes that&quot;underworld informants are very careful individuals.andP;  They won't talk toanyone except the detective who has their confidence.andP;  The last thing theywill do is leave a message or their name with someone else.andP;  However, oncethe detective convinces them of the confidentiality of PhoneMail, they beginto trust the system and leave messages.andP;  This is crucial in crimes involvingthe delivery of drugs.andP;  Previously, detectives had no choice but to wait bythe phone for the tip on time and place.andP;  Now they leave the office toinvestigate other cases while tracking their PhoneMail.&quot;andM;The department's 140 detectives get their PhoneMail messages from cellularcar phones, payphones or at home.andP;  No longer are six clerical workers neededto take messages and relay them to roaming detectives.andP;  Major Schutte notesthat detectives working different shifts can exchange vital informationwithout ever talking personally.andM;PhoneMail has also worked wonders for the department's public informationstaff.andP;  Marianne Pasha, public information coordinator, revels in the newsystem.andP;  &quot;We leave a recording of police news and agency activities - such asarrests, crimes, busts and sweeps.andP;  We give out our telephone number to thelocal media - TV, print and radio  as well as the national wire services.&quot;andO;These agencies simply call into PhoneMail to get the scoop.andP;  &quot;It's especiallyhelpful on the weekends.andP;  Instead of calling or beeping us, newspeople candial in for PhoneMail messages, which we constantly update: I'm also sparedfrom being called away from the crime scene to respond to questions.&quot;andM;Other PhoneMail applications include a phone box that Neighborhood Watchgroups can call to receive recorded alerts to crimes and other problems intheir areas.andM;DID Piracy - Courtesy Of New York TelandM;Dear TELECONNECT.andM;My name is Samuel Quiles, presently employed at Rosenthal and Rosenthal, afinancial institution in Manhattan's garment center As I was reviewing ourcustomer service report, I noticed that New York Tel was charging Rosenthaland Rosenthal a mileage charge for DID trunks within the same central office.andM;This I found ludicrous.andP;  We have 22 DID trunks, and New York Tel was chargingus a $16 50 mileage charge per trunk.andP;  According to our customer servicerecords, these charges we incurred 11130186.andP;  Same time our telephone systemwas upgraded from Dimension 400 to ATandamp;T System 75 PBX.andM;When companies are cutting over switches the telecom manager or person incharge should be aware of mistakes that can occur.andP;  Rosenthal and Rosenthalwas refunded  19,881.28.andM;Note: TELECONNECT welcomes tales of telco wrongdoing by its readers.andM;ATandamp;T ON TOLL FRAUDandM;This comes from a statement issued by ATandamp;T to TELECONNECT:  ATandamp;T cannot takeresponsibility for tariffed charges billed when the customer controls thesecurity of the compromised access.andP;  ATandamp;T does assume the responsibility whenATandamp;T controls the security of the compromised access.andP;  This policy referssolely to regulated services and does not address claims relating tounregulated services or equipment.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T declined to provide TELECONNECT's readers with any specific toll fraudprevention tips.andP;  But, according to ATandamp;T spokesman Andrew Myers, the tips MCIprovided TELECONNECT in our April issue &quot;looked pretty good to me.andM;RATING VENDORSandM;Here's a way of evaluating your present PBX service provider.andP;  Give them ascore of &quot;3&quot;  ...andP;  ..&quot;1,&quot; or &quot;0&quot; on each of these categories compared toother qualified vendors in your area:andM;1.andP;  Average years service-tech experience on your make of PBX.andM;2.andP;  Number of manufacturer-certified technicians per service site.andM;3.andP;  Number of direct support personnel per service site.andM;4.andP;  Frequency of active port recounts for contract repricing.andM;Gauge your vendor's score versus his competitors.andP;  The vendor bidding loweston your RFP may run a leaner service area.andP;  If so, a post-sale switch to aservice vendor less driven by sales margins is likely to improve yoursystem's rehability.andM;Henry Baird, consultant, Seattle, WAandM;TOUCHTONE RIPOFFSandM;In  New York City, the additional monthly charge for touchtone service on afine coming into a PBX is $7.andP;  The monthly touchtone service for a fine notcoming into a PBX  like one coming into a key system) is $4.42.andP;  Similardifferences apply elsewhere.andP;  Be sure the fines with the higher touchtonecost are actually PBX trunks.andP;  If they're not, contact your local telephonecompany business office.andP;  If your PBX telephone system has DID (Direct InwardDial) outside fines, be sure you're not paying a monthly charge for touchtoneon these fines, since they are used for incoming calls only.andP;  Jane Laino,Communications Consultants, NYCandM;FORMAT FOR VERTICAL USEandM;If you turn your computer on its side, you must reformat its hard disk.andP;  Ahard disk formatted for use horizontally will not work as well when usedvertically, and will ultimately give trouble.andM;TUTILITY IN PARADOXandM;Paradox is our favorite database program.andP;  It's the easiest to use.andP;  It worksgreat on networks.andP;  We have it running on our 10-Net and NetWare local areanetworks.andP;  If the network crashes or the file server dies, sometimes ourParadox datafile gets corrupted.andM;To fix it, you need to use a program called TUTILITY.EXE and choose theoption called  Rebuild.&quot;
