Soviet officials recently announced that the Lenin Peace Prize has been awarded to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto. The prize was created by that noted peacemaker Joseph Stalin in 1947. Mr. D'Escoto said that the decoration was given &quot;in recognition of the courageous struggle of the people of Nicaragua, especially the soldiers who are fighting to defend the country's independence.&quot; If Mr. D'Escoto's version of peace deserves a prize, we'd like to see who the Soviets considered to be this year's runners-up. </TEXT></DOC>
