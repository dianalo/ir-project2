The bid opening took place hours after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor refused to issue a stay requested by the state of Alaska to block the sale. Last week, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the bidding to begin when it dissolved a lower court injunction halting the sale.    A partnership of Chevron USA and Unocal Corp., bidding a total of about $55 million with a mix of other oil companies, took most of the 23 blocks leased. Chevron USA is a unit of Chevron Corp.    Shell Western Eandamp;P, a unit of Shell Oil Co., bidding with Amoco Production Co., a unit of Amoco Corp., submitted the single highest bid of $24 million to win one block. The two companies bid a total of $37 million to win five blocks. Mobil Oil Corp., a unit of Mobil Corp., bid about $2.5 million for two blocks.    The sale of lease rights to the environmentally sensitive area took place over protests of Greenpeace USA, which submitted protest &quot;bids&quot; based on the environmental group's calculation of the value of lost salmon, whales and other wildlife inhabiting the area. </TEXT></DOC>
