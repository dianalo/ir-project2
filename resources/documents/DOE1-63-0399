In particular, the Authors examinesome systems including a non-conventional power section consisting offuel cells. An index of comparison is introduced to define selectioningcriteria for the different systems. As an example, a mathematical modelis presented for the performance of a particularly interesting systembased on molten carbonate fuel cells.</TEXT></DOC>
