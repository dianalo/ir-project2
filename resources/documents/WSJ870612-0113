Most banks are still paper factories, processing checks, deposit slips and statements effectively but not efficiently. For years, banks and technology have held shotgun weddings designed to keep paper flowing. Now, as deregulation heightens competition in the financial services industry and spawns new products, banks are casting about for any technology that will help bring them up to date.    &quot;The technology is there to do so many things, but the investment required and inertia&quot; in the industry are high, says Max D. Hopper, who was executive vice president of BankAmerica Systems Engineering, a unit of BankAmerica Corp., between stints at American Airlines where he is senior vice president, information systems, for AMR Corp., American's parent.    Mr. Hopper recalls being stunned when he walked into a Bank of America branch a few years ago and found as many as 10 different computer terminals linked to more than 50 different data-processing systems. Checks were being hand-stuffed into envelopes, he says, which is still the case at many of the nation's 15,000 banks. (It's no longer true at Bank of America, which automated its system a few years ago.)    In trying to make changes, Mr. Hopper found bankers both in love with paper and worried that automation would usurp their control.    &quot;Banks don't put money into where things are going, they only put money into where they are,&quot; says Banc One Corp. Senior Vice President John F. Fisher, who is considered one of the industry's few futurists.    One example: Most banks failed to envision a need to link separate computer systems and thereby get a complete picture of bank customers and their needs. Some that did try failed -- one such flop cost a group of banks about $100 million four years ago -- and they didn't bother to try again. This is why most individuals with several checking and savings accounts receive multiple statements each month, even though the brokerage industry, the banks' competitor in many areas, has issued single statements for years.    A lack of integration also explains why lending officers can't immediately tell whether a would-be borrower carries a bank's credit card, holds sizable certificates of deposit or has kept a mortgage loan up to date. Such information could aid loan-pricing decisions and help broaden bank marketing efforts.    Until banking deregulation began, the industry's product-planning department was in Washington, and &quot;selling wasn't in the banker's vocabulary, it was almost a dirty word,&quot; says Robert A. Heckman, an executive vice president, marketing, at MTech Corp., a provider of data-processing services to banks. Also, banking's stodgy image was hardly attractive to the whiz-bang folks who made technology work for airlines and computer makers. &quot;Lack of sex appeal has held the industry back in all sorts of areas including this one,&quot; says Mr. Fisher.    Even banks that have been aggressive in using technology agree the industry lags. Says John B. McCoy, Banc One chairman, &quot;I don't think there's anybody who will say their bank's backroom is a 10. We're using software built in the '60s and '70s, not the '80s.&quot;    There are some signs of change, including improved automated teller machines and so-called debit cards, which electronically separate bank customers from their money the moment they make a purchase. Some banks have experimented -- not too successfully -- with bank-at-home services for customers who own personal computers and small businesses.    Banc One, Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, and General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. have launched a multimillion-dollar effort to design an integrated computer system that would, among other things, link bank departments and give officers instant access to individual customer data.    &quot;Nobody has been able to bring to the table the quantum leap we have to have,&quot; says Banc One's Mr. McCoy. But that is what's needed now, he believes. &quot;With deregulation, technology is how we're going to beat the other guys,&quot; Mr. McCoy says.
