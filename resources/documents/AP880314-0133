(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Critics of Mississippi's 1890 constitutionsay it is anti-black and anti-business, but an unlikely coalitionof blacks, business people and farmers may kill legislative effortsto rewrite the document.   Gov. Ray Mabus, who took office in January, said rewriting theconstitution ``would show that Mississippi is ready to take a stepinto the next century.''   ``My biggest argument is that the 1890 constitution is adocument that's, in a lot of ways, gotten us into dead solid lastplace and that we really can't do any worse,'' said Mabus, whoincorporated the call for a new constitution into his successfulcampaign last year.   The state House and Senate have each passed a bill that wouldallow voters to decide in a November referendum whether theconstitution would be rewritten in a convention. A conferencecommittee is working out differences in the two bills.   When considering the House bill, the Senate deleted allconvention restrictions, including a requirement that the newdocument include the right-to-work provision from the currentconstitution.   ``It's extremely important to industry and workers'' that a newconstitution include right-to-work, which forbids employers andunions from signing contracts that would require employees to beunion members, said Jerry McBride of the Jackson-based MississippiManufacturers Association.   A right-to-work statute was enacted in 1956 and added to theconstitution in 1960.   Farmers have expressed concern that a new constitution wouldallow the Legislature too much latitude in raising taxes. RichardMorgan of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation in Jackson said hebelieves a current constitutional property classification provisionthat allows a lower tax rate for farm land ``would be overlooked.''   Senators also deleted a provision for the governor to appoint 20delegates in addition to those who would be elected from each ofthe 122 House districts.   Blacks, who represent better than 30 percent of the state'svoters, have said they would oppose a convention without thegubernatorial appointments because they fear they would not beproportionately represented in delegate voting.   Mabus has said that if he is allowed to appoint delegates, hewill geographically and racially balance the convention.   Black legislators have said they fear a convention might reducethe size of the Legislature and make it more difficult for blacksto get elected, allow the state College Board authority to closeany of the state's eight institutions of higher learning, and cutthe number of locally elected public officials.   The College Board recommended in 1985 closing Mississippi ValleyState University, one of Mississippi's three predominantly blackuniversities, but legislators rejected the propsal.   Mississippi has the highest number of black elected officials inthe nation. The House has 20 black members, and two blacks serve inthe 52-member Senate.   Black lawmakers said that while the original document may havebeen anti-black, they do not fear it now.   ``The federal courts have removed many of the racistprovisions,'' said state Rep. Hillman Frazier, who is black.   Leslie McLemore, a political scientist and dean of the graduateschool at predominantly black Jackson State University, said hebelieves the current method of changing the constitution byamendment is a ``piecemeal way of overhauling a document thatreally needs to be rewritten.''   McLemore said if a convention is called, it will be ``extremelyimportant that black people go out and vote.''   University of Mississippi history professor David Sansing isamong those who favor rewriting the document. He said the oldcharter not only disenfranchised blacks, but poor whites as wellwith its poll tax and literacy requirement, although thoseprovisions have been struck down by federal courts.   ``That old constitution is inherently evil, so we can't modifyit with amendments,'' said Meridian car dealer and developer GilCarmichael, who made rewriting the constitution the hallmark ofunsuccessful campaigns for governor in 1975 and 1979 and forlieutenant govenor in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
