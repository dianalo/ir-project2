 They may all look similar and generallydo the same things, but the physical package often hides some bigdifferences.andP;  If your scanner experience has been limited  to watching aslick demo or two, then the Apple Scanner is likely to be a real treat.andP;  It'sa snap to set up, and the basic software is simple and intuitive -- twoattributes that don't necessarily go together.andM;But for a 4-bit (16-gray-tone) monochrome scanner, it's not cheap.andP;  Andtechnically, it's very much a ``me too'' scanner -- not the state- of-the-artunit that we've come to expect from Apple.andP;  In fact, it's so far from thecutting edge that Apple usually aims for and often achieves that you almostwonder if it's a real Apple product.andM;The software is most suited for scanner neophytes.andP;  It's simple to use but islimited in both speed and capability.andP;  If you've used a scanner before,particularly one of the better units by Microtek or DEST, the Apple Scanner(with its AppleScan and HyperScan software) won't be anything special.andM;Physical setup is simply a matter of attaching the scanner to the SCSI portand dragging a file into your System folder.andP;  Apple doesn't provide either acable or a terminator with the Apple Scanner, so be sure to get the correctconnectors.andP;  The manual has excellent instructions on what cables are neededin what situations and when and where terminators are required.andP;  Since theApple Scanner doesn't have built-in terminating resistors as many externalhard disks do these days, it's often easier to put the Apple Scannersomewhere in the middle of a SCSI chain.andP;  That way you won't require aseparate SCSI terminator.andM;The actual hardware is very conventional.andP;  It produces gray-scale images withup to 16 levels.andP;  That's often not enough, as the average person's eyes candistinguish about 50 levels of gray.andP;  The better scanners on the market canproduce gray-scale images with 64 and sometimes even 256 levels.andP;  If yourultimate output device is a 216- dpi (dots per inch) fax device or a 300-dpiLCD shutter or laser printer, then a total of 16 levels of gray issufficient.andP;  But it's inadequate for professional work that is to be printedon Linotronic- type (1,270-dpi and up) printers.andP;  Even the 216-dpi output ofthe ImageWriter LQ wasn't very good (and was plagued by the ``normal''dot-matrix-printer striping effect in black and very dark areas).andM;The software comes in three parts: AppleScan, HyperScan, and a Guided Tour(each on its own disk).andP;  Unless you're a newcomer to the Mac, just dive intoAppleScan and try things out.andM;HyperScan is a stack written by Bill Atkinson that lets you scan and enhanceimages and then place them on HyperCard cards.andP;  It's pretty impressive stuff,but the final results are severely limited by HyperCard's environment.andP;  Imagesize is restricted to the standard card size rather than the actual page sizethe hardware is capable of, and images can't use gray scales at all (2-bitblack-and-white bit maps are all HyperCard currently supports).andP;  WhileHyperScan's effects are very impressive, you'll want to use HyperScan onlywhen the final destination of your image is a HyperCard stack.andP;  All otherwork will involve AppleScan.andM;The AppleScan software is fairly simple and straightforward.andP;  It has manynice, easy-to-use touches built in.andP;  The first step is always the Previewscan.andP;  This is a quick test scan that you use to adjust the controls.andP;  Tostart, select any of three scanning modes: line art, halftone, and grayscale.andP;  Then preview the image.andM;The next step is to fine-tune the image.andP;  This is exceptionally easy sinceyou can try many combinations of threshold, contrast, and brightness to seewhich produces the best final image.andM;Screen updates showing your changes take less time than would a full rescan,since only a small area must be modified.andP;  The controls show both the currentsettings and the previous settings (in a dotted outline), thus making it easyto go back if a change is for the  worse rather than the better.andM;The software can also generate test prints, with the center strip of an imageshowing the actual settings, and the portions above and below the centerdisplaying the settings one step away in either direction.andP;  This way, you cansee if any adjustments need to be made.andP;  In Preview you can save only yoursettings, not the actual image.andM;Once you've decided on the optimal settings, you actually scan the image.andO;This takes considerably longer than a preview, but even at its slowest ittakes less than a minute.andP;  The scanned image comes up in a document window,generally under the various control panel and palette windows.andM;One minor AppleScan problem is that it is sometimes difficult to rememberwhich window to activate to allow a particular operation.andP;  Since each controlpanel and palette is actually a window, creating and manipulating imagesoften involves a lot of switching around.andM;When the image is scanned, you can use AppleScan's fairly limited Tools menu,or you can save the image in a format readable by a more advanced program.andO;If you have advanced graphics-manipulation software, you're much better offdoing your work there rather than in AppleScan, which is really suitable foronly the smallest touch-up jobs.andP;  Images can be saved in PICT, TIFF, orMacPaint format.andP;  AppleScan can open only PICT documents, but that's not toomuch of a drawback unless you have no other image-manipulation software.andM;AppleScan's greatest weakness is its speed.andP;  It's slow; there's no kinderterm to describe its pace.andP;  And if you try to use its drawing tools on alarge scan, it's also imprecise.andP;  In its Fatbits and Chubbybits (smaller thanFatbits but big enough to pick out pixels) modes, I sometimes had troublegetting exactly the point I wanted to modify.andP;  That seemed to be the resultof a slight control delay.andM;Another problem is AppleScan's propensity for creating temporary files thatdo not always close properly.andP;  Such files, which may be large, can't bethrown away until after the application is restarted.andP;  This appears to be arather intractable problem, as the File menu  has a command called RestartAppleScan.andM;The Apple Scanner handles line art about as well as most scanners.andP;  Since youcan easily optimize the scanning parameters, images that require minimalcleanup can be created quickly and easily.andM;The Apple Scanner is also very good on halftones, especially those that areintended for output on 300-dpi devices.andP;  It handles these very well.andP;  Whencreating halftone images, you have a choice of several halftone patterns.andP;  Ifnone of them works, you can create your own.andM;Where the Apple Scanner falters slightly is on gray-scale images.andP;  Thesedays, 4 bits (16 levels of gray) just isn't enough.andP;  Apple- Scanned imagessuffer by comparison with any 64-gray-level images.andP;  Also, the software hasno gray-scale-editing ability whatsoever.andM;The manual is excellent -- one of Apple's best in a long time.andP;  The tutorialis well done, and the rest of the manual maintains this  high standard.andM;Overall, the Apple Scanner is a good deal for light-duty use.andP;  A few dollarsmore will buy a lot more scanning power, but at considerable cost in ease ofuse.andP;  If you scan regularly but not often enough to justify one of theheavy-duty units with 64 or 256 gray levels, or if user convenience is aparamount consideration, the Apple Scanner is for you.andP;  -- Steven BobkerApple Scanner List Price: $1,799 Manufactured by: Apple Computer, 20525Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014;
