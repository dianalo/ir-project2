The 59-year-old attorney and son of Syrian immigrants called fornational unity. His acceptance speech in Congress drew repeatedapplause.   ``Argentina is not well,'' he said. ``It's broken. ... From theseruins, we will construct the country we deserve.   ``This crisis is not an excuse. It is an opportunity, achallenge,'' he told senators, deputies and guests in the ornate,chandeliered chamber.   It was the country's first peaceful transition of political powerbetween two elected presidents since 1928.   ``With faith and hope, we're going to move forward,'' he saidearlier today as he left his apartment for Congress. Crowds alongthe way were enthusiastic but sparse on a chilly, overcast wintermorning.   Also today, Congress formally accepted the resignations ofPresident Raul Alfonsin and Vice President Victor Martinez.Alfonsin's election in 1983 ended a harsh seven-year militarydictatorship.   In a short written statement read by the parliamentary secretary,Alfonsin said, ``The government's room for action was too limited tohave much chance of success in dealing with problems in which anydelay would cause greater suffering for everyone.''   Menem, 59, won election May 14 to return the Peronist Party topower in the pink Government House for the first time since 1976.   Alfonsin, a human rights attorney, was prevented by law fromrunning for re-election. Beset by increasing economic problems andmilitary unrest, Alfonsin succumbed to pressure and decided to giveup power five months before his constitutional mandate ended.   The preceding Peronist government was overthrown by a militarycoup. After Isabel Peron was toppled in March 1976, she was putunder house arrest and Menem, then the governor of rural La RiojaProvince, was jailed for nearly five years.   Menem takes over a nearly bankrupt country that has been wrackedby hyperinflation, rising unemployment and worsening unrest,including food riots in which 14 people were killed in May.   The Central Bank is virtually without reserves and is $4.5billion behind in payments on the $60 billion foreign debt, which isthe third-largest in the developing world behind Brazil and Mexico.The austral, the national currency, has lost 97 percent of its valueagainst the U.S. dollar in four months.   Prices on goods and services have to be readjusted for inflationnearly daily, far outstripping wage increases that are usuallygranted monthly, and hunger in a country that exports beef and grainto the world is becoming more common.   Residents of shantytowns in Rosario, Argentina's third-biggestcity and a meat-packing center, looted food stores again this week,prompting the arrests about 750 people.   About 25 percent of the 10 million residents in metropolitanBuenos Aires live in poverty, a three-fold increase since 1980,according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census. Nearlyone of every three Argentines lives in Buenos Aires, the country'scultural and financial capital.   Menem plans to act quickly in the hopes of curtailing inflationand restarting Argentina's agricultural-based economy. Toward thatend, he appointed a multiparty Cabinet that pledged national unity,to lower the fiscal deficit and to try to attract foreign investment.   Menem, who likes to wear white suits and sport his trademark longsideburns, reportedly has plans to try to streamline inefficientstate companies but similar plans by the Alfonsin government wererepeatedly blocked by the Peronists, who are labor-based and fearloss of jobs.   Argentines, once jubilant at the election of Alfonsin, now viewMenem with a desperate hope.   ``I don't know if I'm happy or sad. I just hope he can dosomething,'' said Roberto Cucho, a public relations specialist.``Gas, food, bus fares _ everything _ seems to have gone up by 100percent in one day. It's infernal.''   Delegations from more than 70 countries, seven of them led byheads of state and including U.S. Commerce Secretary RobertMosbacher, have arrived for the inauguration.   It will be the first time in 61 years that an elected Argentinepresident has given up power to an elected president from adifferent party.   The country has suffered six military coups since 1930.   Alfonsin was to have served through Dec. 10. He announced on June12 that he was powerless to stabilize the economy. Menemsubsequently agreed to take office early.   The heads of state included Peru's Alan Garcia and Nicaragua'sDaniel Ortega. During the afternoon, Ortega and Menem chatted at theluxurious Alvear Palace Hotel, sipping the herbal tea mate.</TEXT></DOC>
