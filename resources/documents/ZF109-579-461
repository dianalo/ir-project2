 It facilitates distributed datacapabilities between SQL/DS running on either VM/SP Release 6, or VME/ESARelease 1 and DB2 Version 2 Release 3.andP;  VM/XA customers moving to VM/ESA willbe able to exploit VSE's Guest Sharing, Remote Relational Access, DatabaseSwitching and distributed database capabilities.andP;  SQL/DS Version 3 Release 2will be available from February 22, 1991, and Release 3 is scheduled forSeptember 30.andP;  Costs range from $10,320 for Group 10 processors and rise to$230,850 for Group 60, and the distributed options are between $7,740 and$173,150 respectively.andP;  Monthly licences are $215 for Group 10, $4,810 forGroup 60, and distributed systems licence options range from $161 to $3,605.andO;The Entry End User/370 Entry Support Licence is $9,290, and the Licence touse costs $2,015.andM;Query Management Facility 3.1andM;Query Management Facility runs with DB2 and Repository Manager/MVS orSQL/Data System in a VM environment.andP;  In comparison with Version 2, IBM saysthat Version 3 offers support for running in the CICS environment and hasenhancements to prompted query, report writer, table editor, databasesupport, common programming interface support and national language support.andO;A user at any node of a network can access data from a single DB2 subsystemor SQL/DS database, and the maximum number of relational columns supportedper table is being increased to 750, providing full access to DB2 tables withmore than 300 columns.andP;  Query Management Facility can run as a conversationaltransaction in the CICS environment, and so long as there are no virtualstorage considerations, the functions supported are the same as those inQMF/MVS.andP;  Larger procedures and queries are enabled by removing the linelimit, and relational prompted query expressions are increased to 255characters.andP;  The Query Management Facility can be allocated above 16Mb inVM/XA and VM/ESA environments, and the SAA CPI for Query callable interfaceis extended to support Fortran, Pl/I and Restructured Extended ExecutorLanguage.andP;  Query Management Facility Version 3 Release 1 base functions willbe available from December 7, 1990.andP;  For Group 18 processors, QMF/MVS costs$14,260, rising to $187,900 for Group 60, and Distributed Systems LicenceOptions are between $10,695 and $140,925.andP;  Monthly Licence charges start at$297 for Group 18, $3,915 for Group 60, and distributed options range from$222 to $2,936.andP;  For QMF/VM Groups 10 to 60, costs range between $7,250 and$162,000 respectively, and the distributed options are between $5,437 and$121,500.andP;  Monthly licences are from $151 to $3,375 for Groups 18 and 60, anddistributed options range between $113 and $2,531.andP;  Entry End User/370 EntrySupport licences cost $4,715, a licence to use is $1,415.andM;Data Propagator MVS/ESA Version 1andM;The Data Propagator is designed to help manage the coexistence ofhierarchical technology in IMS/ESA Database Manager with DB2's relationaltechnology.andP;  Other new features include the Propagation User Exit whichenables users to handle specific mapping cases for segments that requirespecialised mapping if Data Propagator facilities are insufficient, and theSegment User Exit allows users to define a segment differently from thesource.andP;  Costs are from $7,970 for processor Groups 18 and rise to $105,100for Group 60, and distributed system options are between $5,977 and $78,825.andO;Monthly licences are $166 to $2,190 for Groups 18 and 60, distributed systemsoptions cost from $124 to $1,642.andM;IMS/ESA Database Manager Version 3 Release 2andM;The new release of IMS/ESA is claimed to provide enhancements in terms ofavailability and systems management, and it will be available from June 30,1991.andP;  There are data integrity enhancements for the Batch Backout Utilitywith Database Recovery Control of database backout, and the VSAM interfacehas been enhanced.andP;  Database Recovery Control keeps track of logs anddatabase image copies, and it is designed to ensure that the right input isused to perform a recovery function.andP;  Problem determination and problemisolation is facilitated by an enhanced interface between IMS/ESA DB andVSAM.andP;  New performance tuning tools include statistics for database bufferpools which use the OSAM access method and database modelling tool to asigndatabases to specific buffer pools.andP;  An asynchronous change data captureenables selected database changes to be recorded for subsequent processing,and a new capture exit is provided to allow for inspection before recording.andO;IMS/ESA Database manager supports applications written in Cobol, PL/I, C,Pascal, Ada and Assembler.andP;  The SAA application generator also supportsapplications that access IMS database.andP;  IMS/ESA 3.2 executes on allprocessors that run MVS/SP 3 or MVS/ESA SP 4.andP;  APPC/IMS requires MVS/ESA SP4.2.andM;SAA LanguageandM;Access enables plain speaking to DB2, SQL/DSSystems Application ArchitectureLanguageAccess is a natural language query interface to DB2 and SQL/DataSystem.andP;  IBM says that users can retrieve information from the relationaldatabases by formulating questions in their own natural language withouthaving to know a formal query language or having any understanding ofdatabase organisation.andP;  However, the company also says that significant newtechnology in LanguageAccess means limited and staggered availability.andO;LanguageAccess-MVS English has limited availabilty from December 1990, andgeneral availability from December 1991.andP;  VM English, MVS German and VMEnglish have limited availability from June 1991, general availability fromDecember 1991.andP;  LanguageAccess consists of a natural language engine, a queryinterface and customisation tool.andP;  The first analyses input queries,translates them into SQL statements and generates natural languageparaphrases to support query confirmation.andP;  A query interface is provided forQuery Management Facility and Application System users for MVS and VMenvironments so that they can retrieve from DB2 and SQL/DS.andP;  Thecustomisation tool creates models of the database and addsapplication-specific vocabulary.andP;  Cost range from $9,907 to $48,700, monthlylicences from $275 to $1,355.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
