Thenew party will take the NDUP's name. This would add littlepolitical power but could help reclaim respectability for Mr.Kim's party among dissidents.   The planned merger is the first of many maneuvers theoften-jailed Mr. Kim is expected to make in the next twomonths to broaden his party's support from its limited,regional power base in southwestern Korea, analysts said.   A provincial election is coming in June and Mr. Kim needsto do well nationwide to show he has the drawing power to runas the opposition's presidential candidate. Though the NDUPis small and has few well-known political figures, it hassolid dissident credentials. Its leader, 68-yearold Lee WooJung, has been arrested and jailed for her political views.   Mr. Kim, who has long been a thorn in the government'sside, lost the presidential race to Roh Tae Woo in the 1987election when opposition leaders ran separately and split theopposition vote.                                                                                                          GORBACHEV, THE PHILANTHROPIST                                                                                                          President Mikhail Gorbachev has donated millions ofdollars from royalties and foreign prizes to charities in theSoviet Union, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said,quoting a Kremlin financial source. Children's hospitals andclinics were the main beneficiaries in 1990 of about $1.6million from publication of Mr. Gorbachev's works at home andabroad. Awards totaling $1.2 million from the Nobel Peace andItalian Fiuggi prizes went to buy equipment for medicalsites.                                                                                                          AFRICAN DEMOCRACY ROLLS GROW                                                                                                          Carlos Veiga, a lawyer, was sworn in as the first freelyelected prime minister of Cape Verde, vowing to defenddemocracy and a mixed economy in the West Africanarchipelago. The Atlantic republic was the first ofPortugal's five former African colonies to abandon one-partyleftist rule since 1975 independence. In Benin, the interimprime minister, Nicephore Soglo, was inaugurated as the firstfreely elected president in 20 years.

MALAYSIA TURNS PRESERVATIONIST                                                                                                          Malaysia, a major timber exporter, will reduce timberproduction to preserve its forests, but plans to harvest morerubber trees, rattan and bamboo, Deputy Prime Minister GhafarBaba said. Environmentalists have accused Malaysia ofindiscriminate logging, particularly in the Borneo states ofSabah and Sarawak. Mr. Ghafar said Malaysia, the world's toprubber producer, might log more rubber trees to meetfurniture makers' demand.                                                                                                          ANOTHER NUCLEAR PLANT IS SHUT                                                                                                          A faulty pump caused an automatic shutdown at a nuclearpower plant southwest of Tokyo, but no radiation leaked. Itwas the seventh problem at a Japanese nuclear site in the twomonths since the country's worst accident in the industry.   The cooling system failure at the Hamaoka No. 3 plant inShizuoka triggered the halt, Chubu Electric Power Co. said.The reactor, which had been scheduled for an inspectionclosure next week, won't be reactivated until at leastmid-July. Meanwhile, Japan Atomic Power Co. was to restartits Tokai nuclear power plant, with normal operation to begintoday; that reactor was shut March 26 with valve trouble.   The recent nuclear mishaps have led to growing oppositionto Japan's plan to generate 35% of its electricity withnuclear power by 1995, up from 26.6% now.   In Norway, iodine pills to fight radiation sickness werebeing distributed in areas at risk in the event of a Sovietnuclear disaster, officials said. Norway began drawing uppublic protection plans after the country was showered byfallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in theU.S.S.R.

Japan's Imperial Palace, the emperor's office with morethan 10.7 million square feet of prime mid-Tokyo real estate,was valued by the government at $2.71 billion.
