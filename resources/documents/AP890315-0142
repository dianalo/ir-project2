RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, warning ofa ``serious threat to the future of the judiciary,'' made a highlyunusual personal appeal Wednesday for a 30 percent increase infederal judges' pay.   He urged Congress _ which has rejected a 51 percent pay hikeproposed for itself, federal judges and high-ranking governmentofficials _ to give special consideration to the judiciary.   Rehnquist told a rare news conference: ``Judges ought not to bein it for the money. They'd have to be out of their minds.''   But, he continued, ``unlike many other positions, judgingrequires that you be a lawyer. Many people feel lawyers make toomuch money. But that's a fact of life so far as recruiting federaljudges is concerned.''   ``We're not saying offer them the same they would make in privatepractice. We're saying offer them enough so they'll be able toeducate their kids.''   Rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trialjudges from $89,500 now to $116,350, and from $95,000 to $123,000for appeals court judges. The plan would hike the chief justice'syearly pay from $115,000 to $149,500 and raise the salary of otherhigh court justices from $110,000 to $143,000.   The pay raise proposal was adopted Tuesday by the U.S. JudicialConference, the policy-making arm of the federal judiciary presidedover by Rehnquist.   Congress was responding to a public outcry last month when itrejected the proposed 51 percent pay raise recommended by apresidential commission. Supporters of higher pay for judges hopesingling out the judiciary for bigger salaries will easecongressional fears of retaliation by the voters.   ``Failure to adequately address this issue poses the most seriousthreat to the future of the judiciary and its continued operationsthat I have observed,'' Rehnquist said.   He said many federal judges may leave the bench for morelucrative private practice if no relief is provided, noting thatsome young judicial law clerks make more money than judges as soonas the clerks begin private practice.   The problem is particularly acute in big cities where recruitingqualified judges is becoming more difficult, Rehnquist said.   ``Without redress, the federal judiciary as we know it cannotcontinue to meet the high standards the public has come to expectfrom it,'' he said.   Rehnquist noted that appointment to the federal bench is intendedto be for a lifetime to insulate judges from political pressures.   By contrast, he said that state judges in his home state ofArizona frequently used a judicial appointment as a steppingstone tocareer advancement.   A lifetime appointment ``gives you a different kind of judge,someone simply devoted to judging rather than looking out of thecorner of your eye for the next political opportunity that comesalong,'' Rehnquist said.   The U.S. Judicial Conference said the number of judges resigningto return to private practice is increasing. It said 57 federaljudges have resigned since 1974, compared with six in the 16preceding years.   There are some 540 federal trial judges and 150 appeals courtjudges.</TEXT></DOC>
