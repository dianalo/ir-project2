Two-thirds of Argentina's foreign debt of $60 billion plus $6.5billion in overdue interest is owed to commercial banks. Thelargest creditors include Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattanand Citibank.   ``Sometime before the end of the day it (payment) will takeplace,'' Citibank's local president, Ricardo Handley, told theindependent Radio Mitre.   The announcement coincided with the arrival Friday of MichelCamdessus, director-general of the International Monetary Fund.   The last payment was made in May. That $40 million was the firstinterest payment in two years.   The government of President Carlos Menem wants to negotiate adebt reduction, lower interest rates and new funds with itscreditors. Central Bank President Javier Gonzalez Fraga plans tofly to New York in late July to resume talks on those issues.   A steering committee representing private banks has insistedthat significant payments be made on overdue interest before debtreduction or fresh loans will be considered.   A director of another U.S. bank, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the banks want payments of $100 million a month. Headded that the banks believed Argentina is capable of such payments.   Central Bank director Roque Fernandez said Thursday that foreignreserves, which were little more than $100 million when Menem wasinaugurated in July 1989 now top $2.1 billion.   The government on Friday reported the cost of living rose by13.9 percent in June and a total of 716 percent for the first sixmonths of this year.   The monthly rate was a disappointment to the government, whichhad hoped to hold the cost of living increase to a single digit forthe first time since November.   The government has committed itself with the IMF to reducemonthly inflation to 2 percent by December.   Argentina has suffered triple-digit annual inflation in 15 ofthe past 16 years. Last year, inflation soared to 4,924 percent.   Also Friday, Argentina and Brazil pledged to remove all barriersto bilateral trade by Dec. 31, 1994.   Trade between South America's two largest countries amounted to$2 billion in 1989, with Argentina posting a $401 million surplus.   Trade in 1988 totaled $1.7 billion, with Brazil posting a $364million surplus.</TEXT></DOC>
