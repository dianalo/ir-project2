The rule regulatesthe introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into theenvironment) of genetically engineered organisms and products which areplant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulatedarticles). The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for therelease into the environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limitedpermits for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can be introducedin the United States.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Monsanto Agricultural Company of St. Louis, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tomato plants that are designed to be tolerant to tobacco mosaicvirus. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tomato plants under theconditions described in the Monsanto application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by the Monsanto Agricultural Company, as wellas a review of other relevant literature, provides the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding the tobacco mosaic virus cost (capsid) protein has beeninserted into a tomato chromosome. In nature, the genetic material containedin a plant chromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatibleplant via cross-pollination. In this field trial, the inserted gene cannotspread to any other plants by cross-pollination, because the field testplot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexually compatible plantswith which the genetically engineered tomato plants could cross-pollinate.2. While the tobacco mosaic virus is a plant pest, neither the tobaccomosaic virus coat (capsid) protein gene itself, nor its derived gene product,confer on tomato any plant pathogenic characteristic.3. The vector used to transfer the tobacco mosaic virus coat (capsid) proteingene into a tomato chromosome has been evaluted for its use in this experiment.The vector has been derived from a DNA sequence with known plant pathogenicpotential, but has been disarmed. Phytohormone genes which are necessaryto confer plant pathogenic traits have been removed from the vector. Thevector has been tested and shown to be not pathogenic to susceptible plants.4. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA, has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associated with thetransformed tomato plants.5. Horizontal movement of the introduced genes to another organism is notpossible. The vector acts by delivering the gene to the tomato genome whereit is stably inserted into the tomato chromosomal DNA. The vector doesnot survive alone in the transformed plant. No mechanism of horizontalmovement is known to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism.6. The size of the field test plot is approximately 0.2 acre and will belocated in the center of a large research farm. The field test plot issurrounded by irrigation canals approximately 20 feet wide on 3 sides anda chain-linked fence on the 4th side. The level of physical containmentto prevent any unintentional release into the environment has been foundto be adequate.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508; (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 27 day of April, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
