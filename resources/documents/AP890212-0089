The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammadremoved from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they wereinspired by Satan.   Moslem critics _ whom Rushdie has called fundamentalistextremists _ say the book is blasphemous and have protested fromLondon to New Delhi.   On Sunday, five people died and at least 80 were wounded whenpolice fired on a crowd of protesters outside a U.S. governmentoffice in Islamabad, Pakistan, who were demanding that the UnitedStates ban the book.   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a BritishTV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown upby terrorists en route from India to London.   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and takeon the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.   Rushdie denies that his novel attacks the Islamic religion, whichhe says has been of central importance to him all his life. He saidit deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love,death, London and Bombay.''   He said the disputed passage concerning a prophet living in afantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,happens in a dream -- ``the fictional dream of a fictional character... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further fromhistory could one get?''   The novel was first published in Britain in September and gotgenerally good reviews but it was banned in India and some Arabcountries. Moslem religious leaders in Britain condemned it as a``deliberate attack on a faith and its founders.''   Moslems threatened to boycott bookshops stocking it and someshops, frightened by demonstrators, removed it from their shelves.   British writers protested the attacks and playwright TomStoppard, poet Stephen Spender and novelist Kingsley Amis were amonga number who cabled Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi protesting atthe ban.   In November, the book won the ``new novel'' category in theannual literary competition sponsored by the Whitbread brewinggiant, but it did not win the overall Whitbread prize, which went inJanuary to a first novel by another writer.   The Guardian, London's liberal daily, on Monday quoted Rushdie assaying he was ``very upset'' at the deaths in Islamabad on Saturdayand he felt that leaders of Pakistan's religious parties werewhipping up emotion.   Rushdie was quoted as saying: ``The thing that is most disturbingis that they are talking about a book that doesn't exist. The bookthat is worth killing people for and burning flags for is not thebook that I wrote. The people who demonstrated in Pakistan and whowere killed haven't actually read the book because it isn't on salethere.''   Rushdie is 41 and a British citizen. He grew up in Bombay, cameto Britain at age 14 and won honors for history studies at CambridgeUniversity.   He has six books behind him, including three prize-winningnovels, ``Midnight's Children,'' ``Shame'' and ``The SatanicVerses,'' and ``The Jaguar Smile'' about his travels in Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
