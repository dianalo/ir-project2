<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0591 </DOCNO><TEXT>The manifestly covariant formalism with constraints is used for the constructionof relativistic wave equations to describe the dynamics of N interactingspin 0 and/or spin 1/2 particles. The total and relative time evolutionsof the system are completely determined by means of kinematic type waveequations. The internal dynamics of the system is 3/sup N-1/ dimensional,besides the contribution of the spin degrees of freedom. It is governedby a single dynamical wave equation, that determines the eigenvalue ofthe total mass squared of the system. The interaction is introduced ina closed form by means of two-body potentials. The system satisfies anapproximate form of separability.</TEXT></DOC>
