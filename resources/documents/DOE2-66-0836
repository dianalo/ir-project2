By applyingrecent theoretical developments about the dynamics of nucleus-nucleuscollisions together with the results obtained from a dynamical modelfor particle production in nucleon-nucleon collisions at high energies,satisfactory agreement with the data from cosmic-ray experiments is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
