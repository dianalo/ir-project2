(multimedia systems forcomputer-based training)</TITLE><AUTHOR>: Rosenthal, Steve.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Interactive videodiscs are the fastest-growing type ofcomputer-based training (CBT) system, currently accounting for 20percent of the CBT market.andP;  Videodiscs are far more expensive toproduce than text-based training tools and sell for $100,000 andup, but the use of microcomputers as production tools hasdrastically reduced videodisc development costs since 1987.andO;Creative Strategies Research International sells its InfoWindowTouch Display System, including an IBM PS/2 Model 30 computer,videodisk player and touch-screen display, for approximately$7,000.andP;  IBM offers more than 600 videodisc courseware titles, andmany companies are developing their own training courses usingspecialized 'authoring' systems.andP;  Some users continue to preferin-house training to elaborate videodiscs obtained from outside.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Interactive SystemsMultimedia TechnologyTraining of EmployeesComputer-Assisted InstructionCourseware.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>INTERACTIVE VIDEODISCS ARE HOTandM;While no single form of computerized training fits every application orbudget, nearly everyone in the industry agrees that the rising star ofcomputer-based training is the interactive videodisc.andP;  Videodiscs alreadyconstitute about 20% of the market for computer-based training, says MelissaBerkowitz, director of applications at CEIT Systems (San Jose, Calif.), afirm specializing in computer-based training, and the percentage is growing.andM;At $100,000 and up for a typical one-hour disc, says Rockley Miller, editorand publisher of the newsletter The Videodisc Monitor (Arlington, Va.),andO;videodiscs can cost substantially more to produce than text-basedcomputerized training.andM;In the last two years, the use of PCs as production tools has reducedvideodisc development costs and has increased the available applications,says Nick Arnett, of Creative Strategies Research International (Santa Clara,Calif.).andP;  The InfoWindow TouchDisplay system combines an IBM PC or PS/2computer, a touchscreen display that can overlay graphics and video images,and a videodisc player.andP;  The cost is reasonable: An InfoWindow system basedon and including a PS/2 Model 30, for example, lists for about $7,000.andM;&quot;We're dealing with an industry now rather than a scattering of players,&quot;says Raymond G. Fox, president of the Society for Applied LearningTechnology, in Warrenton, Va.andP;  As a result, the number of off-the-shelfvideodisc applications is growing rapidly, claims Peter Blakeney, manager ofmarket support for IBM MultiMedia Solutions, in Atlanta.andM;The latest IBM MultiMedia Courseware catalog lists more than 600 videodisccourses for the InfoWindow system, including five courses on 1-2-3 that coverbasic operation to advanced application building.andP;  In addition to those onpopular business software, the courses range from general businessmathematics to medical diagnostic techniques.andP;  For a copy of the MultiMediaCourseware catalog, contact your local IBM dealer or write to IBM MultiMediaSolutions, Dept.andP;  7EY, P.O. Box 2150, Atlanta, GA 30055.andM;In addition, more companies are developing their own training courses.andP;  Atleast half a dozen packages claim to let a subject-matter expert with littleor no expertise in computers produce a viable course.andP;  These programs includeAuthology ($6,000 from CEIT Systems, San Jose, Calif.), AuthorwareProfessional ($8,050, from Authorware, Minneapolis), and TenCore Producer($1,800, from Computer Teaching Corp., Champaign, Ill.).andP;  Although they arerelatively expensive, these packages often include training and ongoingtechnical support.andM;However, not every custom training project has proven successful.andP;  Aftersurveying about 40 videodisc training programs, Diane Gayeski and DavidWilliams, partners in the development firm of OmniCom Associates (Ithaca,N.Y.), concluded that the success of a project depended more onorganizational involvement than on the cost of production or the method ofinstruction.andP;  Projects with the tightest connection to the users' jobs, saysGayeski, were the most likely to be successful.andM;&quot;Overwhelmingly, the projects done in-house had the longest shelf life, evenwhen they weren't as slick,&quot; she says.andP;  &quot;In fact, slickness and expenseseemed to be inversely correlated with the success of a training program.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
