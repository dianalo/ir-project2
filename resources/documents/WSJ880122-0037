He moves to the head of the pack as his support nearly doubles, to 19% from 10% in November, among voters likely to attend Democratic caucuses, a new NBC News poll finds. He will keep pushing populist themes with assaults on corporate and government corruption. Simon loses the most, falling from the top spot to 15% in the poll. He plans a media blitz stressing Democratic traditions.    Dukakis remains hotly competitive, with the support of 18% of those polled. Critics charge he hasn't offered strong new themes, but he plans a speech proposing &quot;positive&quot; alternatives to Gephardt's trade ideas and begins an ad campaign opposing Contra aid. Babbitt, still trailing the field, attacks Simon for accepting PAC contributions.    Dole gains slightly on Bush in New Hampshire in an NBC poll among GOP voters there, but negative feelings about both men increase.    PROBLEMS REMAIN for Aquino, partly because of lagging U.S. support.    Despite election gains, U.S. officials worry she lacks a strategy for defeating Communist insurgents. But the Pentagon has been slow to create an organization, ordered by Congress, to help deal with insurgent activities around the world. And military aid has been shaky. &quot;We haven't acted as a real friend or ally,&quot; says retired Army Gen. R.G. Stillwell, a Pentagon adviser.    The U.S. wants Aquino to concentrate on economic recovery. Sens. Cranston of California and Lugar of Indiana urge a U.S. &quot;mini-Marshall&quot; plan for the Philippines. The administration rejects that as too costly, but State Department officials will take new offers of assistance to Aquino next week. The U.S. also may speed up already-authorized funds.    TRADE LEGISLATION is still alive, despite rosier deficit figures.    The trade gap will still hit a record $170 billion or more for all of 1987. Further gains are expected to be slow and erratic, and this year's deficit still could be as high as $150 billion -- enough to fan support for a trade bill. Japanese reports of a widening surplus with the U.S. last month could give the bill a boost if the same trend appears in U.S. data next month.    Since the stock-market crash, the administration has become even more adamant about vetoing any bill it deems protectionist. Some congressional Democrats consider holding the president's new U.S.-Canadian trade pact hostage to administration cooperation on the broader trade measure. Another congressional lever: Reagan's requests for trade-negotiating authority.    The administration wants Congress to take up the Canadian pact soon, but Democrats want to delay till June.    BUSH KEEPS GOING in Iowa after his strategists reject switching his emphasis mainly to New Hampshire. The idea was to try to solidify a win in New Hampshire, where Bush is favored, that would blunt a possible Dole win in Iowa. But aides feared that a reduced Iowa effort could lead to the embarrassment of Robertson's also beating Bush.    NOTCH NUMBERS: Simon and Kemp court politically potent notch babies, people born between 1917 and 1921 who claim to be shortchanged on Social Security benefits. They number 50,000 in Iowa alone. But the candidates don't offer specifics for a fix that could cost up to $284 billion over 10 years.    HIDDEN HORRORS in the last-minute spending measure passed before Christmas will be used by Reagan to criticize Congress in his State of the Union address. Among the items: a grant to study the feasibility of raising redfish in ponds; a study on the decline in asparagus yield; and funds to begin a catfish farm in Louisiana.    WRIGHT APOLOGIZES for inflammatory letters sent to publications by a new press officer complaining about articles on the House speaker. He jokes at a luncheon with reporters that he is &quot;eating crow.&quot; Though even some Wright allies are dubious, the speaker says he never saw the letters.    FRANK THE KNIFE? Carlucci pushes long-term defense-budget cuts.    The new defense secretary differs sharply in style from Weinberger. To carry out budget restrictions, he seeks selective cuts that would produce savings over the next four to five years. &quot;The reductions are immense,&quot; says an Air Force official. Democratic Rep. Schroeder approvingly contrasts Carlucci with Weinberger, who, she says, &quot;didn't want to cut anything.&quot;    Pentagon officials say Carlucci also is more likely than Weinberger was to defer to Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Crowe on purely military matters. &quot;Weinberger always kept him under his thumb,&quot; says one former defense aide. Amid general praise for Carlucci, former Navy Secretary Lehman criticizes some proposed budget cuts.    Carlucci's long-term planning is seen as a sign that he hopes to stay on if another GOP administration takes office.    MINOR MEMOS: Dole's autobiography says under a picture of him in a track uniform that in 1941, &quot;I entered Kansas State University&quot;; he actually went to archrival University of Kansas. . . . Dukakis's Boston headquarters offers a free trip to Jamaica for the staffer who gets the most volunteers to work in Iowa. . . . Faded attraction? The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee loses money with a fund-raiser letter signed by Cuomo, whose name on a 1984 mailing drew big bucks. </TEXT></DOC>
