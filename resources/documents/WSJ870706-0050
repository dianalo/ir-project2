StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP FREST CANDA JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   As the dollar climbed to its highest level in more than three months against the Japanese yen Friday, some traders and economists predicted a brighter future for the U.S. currency.    But the three-month peak may also represent the end of this leg of the dollar's upward correction, other market participants maintain. Even bullish forecasters restrict their optimism to the near term, expecting additional declines farther down the road.    Investment flows from Japan figure importantly in the latest rise in bullish sentiment for the dollar, and the U.S. unit is expected to strengthen more against the yen than against other major currencies. That trend already showed itself last week, as the dollar climbed 1.6% against the Japanese unit, in contrast to a 0.7% rise against the West German mark.    &quot;The dollar is returning to the uptrend, especially against the yen,&quot; Keiichi Udagawa, chief foreign exchange trader at the Bank of Tokyo's New York branch, said. &quot;The dollar is very gradually going up, one day, then another day, and another.&quot; The dollar's progress most of last week resembled a crawl, with trading volume reduced by summer vacations in Europe and a slowdown in the U.S. ahead of the Independence Day holiday.    Mr. Udagawa said the dollar's recent rise against the yen is related to the coinciding downward correction in the Tokyo stock market. Proceeds from stock sales there, he said, are &quot;coming back to the U.S.&quot;    Marc M. Goloven, vice president and economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, agreed that a shift by Japanese investors into dollar assets, primarily bonds, is benefiting the dollar. He said the pace of Japan's foreign currency bond purchases has probably more than doubled since falling to $3.3 billion in March.    &quot;When those funds were staying home in March and April, that's when we saw Japanese stocks explode and Japanese bond yields collapse. Now we're almost seeing the flip side of that,&quot; Mr. Goloven said.    In a speech last week, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also said that the pace of Japanese investment in U.S. securities was quickening because of an improved outlook for the dollar.    The dollar also was supported Friday by Japan's report that its current account surplus narrowed to $7.09 billion in May, from $7.99 billion in April.    But some traders believe that central bank intervention, or the fear of it, may drive the dollar back down from last week's levels. These concerns are based on an agreement this year among the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada to maintain exchange-rate stability.    &quot;The dollar is getting near its highs for the time being. I'm not advising buying dollars at these levels,&quot; said Shunsuke Sekiguchi, chief foreign exchange trader at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., New York.    There is greater agreement that, over the long run, the dollar will resume its decline because of the U.S. budget deficit, sluggish economic growth, and continuing large trade shortfalls, despite improvements. &quot;Long term, I'm bearish. But for the next couple of months, I'm bullish,&quot; Mr. Udagawa said.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar strengthened against most major currencies Friday, led by a 0.9% rise against the Japanese yen.    Volume was slight due to the U.S. holiday weekend and European vacations.    In late New York trading, the U.S. unit stood at 148.76 yen, up from 147.50 Thursday. The dollar also climbed 0.4% to 1.8398 West German marks, from 1.8329. The British pound fell to $1.6105, from $1.6169.    Behind the dollar's strength against the yen was Friday's decline in Tokyo share prices and the news that Japan's current account surplus narrowed in May.    U.S. futures exchanges were closed Friday for the Independence Day holiday.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                      Friday, July 3, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
