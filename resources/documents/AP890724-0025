LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 80 of the dead in the 19-monthuprising against Israeli rule are Palestinians killed by their ownpeople, and Arab against Arab violence is growing as the revoltdrags on without a political resolution.   Why are Palestinians killing Palestinians?   Most of those killed were accused of being informers orotherwise collaborating with Israel. But some Palestinian sourcessay political battles over the direction of the ``intefadeh,'' oruprising, have turned violent and bred threats, car burnings andeven murder.   Israeli officials claim the slayings support their position thatthe PLO fosters terrorism. But Palestinian sources say at leastsome of the violence is by radicals challenging PLO chief YasserArafat's calls for restraint.   For whatever reason, the tempo has accelerated. From the startof the uprising in December 1987 to the end of last year, 22Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs. So far this year, atleast 61 have been slain.   In addition to those slayings, the deaths of at least 518Palestinians have been attributed to Israeli soldiers or civilians.Thirty-eight Israelis have also been killed.   The uprising, aimed at ending Israel's 22-year occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza Strip, has employed brute force againstuncooperative Palestinians from its first days, even as clashesraged between the territories' residents and the Israeli army.   Those who challenged the uprising's efforts to break ties withIsrael were threatened, beaten and sometimes had their cars orhouses set ablaze.   Often the political message was clear.   After the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising called forPalestinians to stop working as police for the military government,a Arab policeman was stabbed to death in Jericho.   His body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, was dumped on hismother's doorstep. Shortly thereafter, several hundred Arabpolicemen quit their jobs.   Hassan Tawil, appointed mayor of the West Bank town of El-Birehby Israel after it deposed the elected mayor, has survived astabbing attack. His house was set afire during the uprising. Henow employs bodyguards.   The motives for some murders seem religious or moral, especiallyin attacks by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, anon-PLO group that has targeted drug dealers and prostitutes.   In other cases, motives have been cloudy _ Palestinians say avictim was a collaborator, while army officials saying he waskilled in criminal or family feuds. Palestinians say some of thoseslain were simply thugs who sold their services to anyone,including Israel.   While Palestinians have maintained the targets were those whothwarted the revolt for selfish reasons, some actions have hadpolitical purposes.   Arafat issued a public death threat to Mayor Elias Freij ofBethlehem after Freij suggested suspending the uprising as a signalto encourage Israeli compromise.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, masked men have twice visitedand threatened local Palestinians who met Israeli officials todiscuss the Israeli proposal for elections in the occupiedterritories as a step toward peace.   However, the PLO announced recently from its headquarters inTunis that it approved of the meetings and was getting reports fromPalestinians who were taking part.   Signs of disunity surfaced in May with arson attacks on cars ofwell-known PLO supporters in Ramallah and Nablus and the murder ofa village leader of Arafat's Fatah PLO faction at Yaabed in theWest Bank.   PLO supporters deny that rifts among Palestinians have explodedinto violence, blaming the trouble on collaborators or attempts byIsrael to foster disunity.   One well-placed source, speaking privately, derided PLO claimsthat the internal debate was not turning violent. He said both therecent car burnings and the slaying of the Fatah leader in Yaabedvillage were evidence of a split in Arafat's own faction.   The victim, he said, was a PLO treasurer who rejected a Fatahrebel's demand for money to escalate the revolt. Two days later,the treasurer was found slain outside the village mosque.   The source said the split over tactics reflected bothdifferences among PLO officials abroad and resentment by PLOleaders in the villages and refugee camps that have been the realbattleground of the uprising.   He said many local leaders spent years in prison foranti-Israeli activities but see the real power for guiding theuprising still held by traditional ruling Palestinian families inArab east Jerusalem.   Israeli officials have pointed to the dissent and violence amongPalestinians as evidence that Arafat is using murder as a weapon torein in those who would be willing to cast off PLO leadership andaccept Israel's peace initiative.   Palestinians deny this charge. They note that Israel has failedto produce one specific case of this type of political murder.</TEXT></DOC>
