The government also said two men were captured after they firedat soldiers guarding a bridge early Saturday. Four Western reportersleft China after being expelled for violating martial law.   Authorities allowed civilians onto Tiananmen Square for the firsttime since soldiers backed by tanks entered the plaza the night ofJune 3-4 to drive out student protesters and crush their seven-weekmovement for a freer society.   About 10,000 children wearing red scarves of the Young Pioneers,a Communist youth group, lined up on the 100-acre square in centralBeijing while group members placed a wreath of flowers at theHeroes' Monument.   The monument, where thousands of pro-democracy demonstratorsgathered day and night for three weeks until the army moved in, wasdecorated with banners including one that read: ``Love socialism andthe mother country.''   After the ceremony the children were trucked out of Tiananmen,which is still blocked off by armed soldiers. Pedestrians are notallowed inside.   China's evening TV news on Friday showed crews disinfecting thesquare, repairing the pavement and replanting bushes. The militarytook selected reporters on a tour of the square Friday.   The eight sentenced to die were the first to be condemned fortrying to stop the People's Liberation Army from moving on thestudent protesters in Tiananmen, the symbolic center of China.   The seven men and one woman were identified in an officialtelevision report as workers, peasants and unemployed localresidents, and were shown appearing before the Beijing People'sIntermediate Court for sentencing.   Three men in Shanghai were sentenced to death Thursday after acourt said they incited protests and set fire to a train in riotingfollowing the crackdown in Beijing.   Beijing radio said 109 people in the capital had turnedthemselves in since the government started rounding up leaders ofthe pro-democracy movement. It also said 16 people surrendered inNanjing, one of the many Chinese cities where protests broke outafter the military sweep in Beijing.   Authorities have arrested more than 1,200 people nationwide inthe last two weeks, including four on a wanted list of 21 studentleaders.   The official Xinhua News Agency said two ``ruffians'' shot atsoldiers and injured one after troops fired warning shots andordered the gunmen to stop.   The gunmen fled but were later captured and turned over tosecurity forces, Xinhua said. The report did not say how theyobtained the firearms.   John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S.Government-run Voice of America, both resident correspondents inBeijing, arrived in Hong Kong after being told Wednesday to leavethe country within 72 hours.   They were accused of violating martial law regulationsprohibiting foreign reporters from covering the pro-democracymovement.   Vernon Mann and John Elphinstone, both of Britain's IndependentTelevision News, also took a flight to Hong Kong on Saturday afterbeing given 24 hours to leave China.   Officials in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, accusedthem of violating martial law while filming unrest in thesouth-central city on Wednesday.   A week ago, Peter Newport, another ITN journalist, was orderedout of China from Shanghai, where he had scuffled with police whilefilming a small student rally.   The government issued another martial law order Saturdaydirecting people to turn over to public security officials all gunsor broadcasting or videotaping equipment.   It also kept up its attacks on the Voice of America, saying theshort-wave radio network was ``perpetrating a fraud.''   VOA ``kept spreading the rumor that the Liberation Army committeda `blood bath' of Tiananmen Square so as to attack China,'' Xinhuasaid in a commentary.   The government says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, werekilled in the confrontation. Chinese witnesses and Westernintelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds and killedup to 3,000.   The government did not deny that people were killed ``during thequelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' Xinhua said, butrepeated earlier statements that no one was killed when troopsmarched into the square.   ``The nearly 300 people who died included officers and men of theLiberation Army, a handful of ruffians who deserved their deaths,and a small number of citizens who deserved their deaths,'' Xinhuasaid.   The VOA is a major source of information for millions of Chineseseeking information other than news reported by the tightlycontrolled domestic press.   China's top trade official was quoted Saturday as urging foreigngovernments to resume aid and loans to China that had been cut offin protest of the crackdown.   The United States has banned military sales and contracts, Francehas frozen relations with China and Japan has put off newdevelopment assistance loans.   Aid suppliers should take a ``farsighted view'' of their economicrelations with China and not ``interfere with Chinese internalaffairs,'' Beijing radio quoted Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreigneconomic relations and trade, as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
