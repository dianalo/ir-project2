The purchase of the Chicago-area suburban bank is part of a plan to expand into consumer and small business markets, said Leo Mullin, First Chicago executive vice president. He said buying First United doesn't end the search for further acquisitions in Illinois or elsewhere in the Midwest.    As part of the acquisition, First United stockholders either can receive $20.83 in cash for each First United share of common stock, or can receive shares of a new issue of First Chicago convertible preferred stock.    First Chicago, with assets of $39.1 billion, is the parent company of First National Bank of Chicago. Arlington Heights, Ill.-based First United is a bank holding company with $1.1 billion in assets.    Mr. Mullin said that First Chicago is paying about 2.4 times First United's book value to acquire it, which is in line with recent bank acquisitions.    He also said that First Chicago holds nearly 20% of downtown Chicago's consumer deposits and about 6% of suburban Chicago's consumer deposits. </TEXT></DOC>
