James Schlichting, an aide to FCC chairman Dennis R. Patrick,said Patrick had hoped for a vote on the proposal next month, but aconsensus among the commissioners eluded him.   ``There are so many complex issues and a long draft order, wewanted to give commissioners an additional opportunity to study theissues and consider it in January,'' said Schlichting.   That meeting is scheduled for Jan. 19.   The decision to delay consideration of the proposal alsorecognizes opposition in Congress, he said. Key members have saidthe already bad relations between Congress and the FCC will beworsened considerably if the agency adopts the proposal beforelawmakers return to Capitol Hill in early January.   On Wednesday, the Democratic staff of the House Energy andCommerce telecommunications subcommittee sent the FCC a reportconcluding that the agency is without legal authority to switch fromprofit regulation to price caps. The report claims the law requiresthat phone rates be based on the cost of providing service.   The proposal would lift limits on the profits that AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell phone companies canearn on the interstate long-distance portions of their businesses.Instead, the commission would set a ceiling on rates, limitingincreases to 3 percentage points less than annual inflation. Underthe plan, phone companies could choose to stay with the currentrate-of-return regulation or switch to price caps.   A 380-page revision of the plan is being circulated amongcommissioners. It proposes to implement the plan in April only forATandamp;T and to submit the issue of rate caps for the Bell operatingcompanies to further study, according to sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
