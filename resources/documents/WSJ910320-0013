Let's call it anomen. Now that no one is left on Wall Street with pocketsdeep enough to attract ambitious prosecutors, look toenvirolitigators to bring the next wave of abusive criminalcases.   When Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl got word that the ExxonValdez had run aground, he did not pick up the phone to seeif Capt. Joseph Hazelwood had first obtained a permit to huntbirds. Exxon does not have a corporate strategy of luringmigratory birds by dumping 10 million gallons of crude oilinto the sea. Yet the only criminal statute to which ExxonCorp. pleaded guilty last week is aimed at regulating thehunting of migratory birds. A subsidiary, Exxon Shipping,also pleaded guilty to two other questionable &quot;crimes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The migratory-bird statute, excerpted nearby, has nothingto do with oil spills or environmental protection. It createspenalties for hunting these birds out of season or withoutthe proper license. The treaty and law were needed becausehunters earlier this century endangered migratory birds. Thelaw &quot;recited that many species of birds in their annualmigrations traversed certain parts of the U.S. and ofCanada,&quot; the Supreme Court explained in a 1920 case, &quot;butwere in danger of extermination through lack of adequateprotection. It therefore provided for specified closedseasons and protection in other forms.&quot;   How does this international anti-poaching rule apply tothe Exxon oil spill? According to the Justice Department --which insisted on a criminal plea despite the option ofdemanding the same amount in fines from civil charges alone-- accidentally spilling oil is akin to hunting out ofseason. The plea agreement Exxon signed admits, &quot;It was oilowned by Exxon and transported under contract with ExxonShipping that killed migratory birds, for which Exxon had nopermit.&quot;   So here is the legal rule: Before you spill oil, make sureyou get a migratory-bird hunters' permit. This would behilarious if it weren't scary. The nation's largest oilcompany was forced to pay a $1 billion settlement, includingthe record $100 million criminal environmental fine, for verycurious crimes.   The Justice Department also demanded that Exxon'ssubsidiary Exxon Shipping plead guilty to violating the CleanWater Act (&quot;did negligently cause the discharge of pollutants. . . without a permit&quot;) and the Refuse Act (&quot;discharged anddeposited refuse matter . . . without a permit&quot;). Theseenvironmental laws, especially the rarely used Refuse Act,were aimed at willful polluters. This spill was obviously anaccident, far from gunning down migratory birds or secretlydumping waste. The law traditionally required that a crimeinclude &quot;mens rea,&quot; or some evil intent, but in selectedcases the Justice Department now equates accidents withcrimes.   At least prosecutors dropped felony counts in theindictment that Exxon committed &quot;willful or knowingviolations&quot; by intentionally hiring an incompetent crew forthe Exxon Valdez. Attorney General Dick Thornburghacknowledged that these felony charges made for &quot;a uniquecase which requires some innovative legal approaches whichare never without risk.&quot; The Justice Department could havesold tickets if it had actually sent a prosecutor to try toconvince a jury that Exxon intentionally spilled the oil.   Richard Stewart, the assistant attorney general who ledthe case against Exxon, defends the plea bargain. Mr. Stewartacknowledged there is &quot;some debate about the elements offoreseeability&quot; in the migratory-bird law, but calls theExxon Valdez the &quot;environmental equivalent of a nuclearbomb.&quot; He said Exxon &quot;had reports that Hazelwood was notcompetent,&quot; so the firm's &quot;culpability went beyond simplenegligence to a much higher degree.&quot; Insisting that Exxonsign a criminal plea, he said, &quot;reflected the moralsensibilities of the community.&quot;   This argument would carry more weight if prosecutors andenvironmentalists had tempered their demands that Exxon pleadto a crime after Capt. Hazelwood was acquitted on the mostserious charges. Last year, the Alaska jury ruled he was notintoxicated or reckless.   Another sign of politics over law in this case is anunusual provision that treats the plea bargain as if it werea proposed regulation. &quot;Notice of this agreement shall bepublished in the Federal Register,&quot; the plea bargain says,&quot;and the agreement shall be subject to public comment for aperiod of 30 days.&quot; If public comments &quot;show that theagreement is inappropriate, improper or inadequate,&quot; then theU.S. or Alaska can pull out of the deal. This supposedlylegal agreement is subject to purely politicalreconsideration.   Why would Exxon plead to these charges and fines to settlethe lawsuits? At a news conference last week, a clearlyfrustrated Mr. Rawl said Exxon thought it could haveprevailed at trial, but that &quot;years of litigation, maybedecades, weren't in anyone's interest.&quot; He spoke of a&quot;lunatic fringe&quot; that wanted to &quot;hang everybody at Exxon&quot; foran accident. One measure of our unpredictable court system isthat on the day of the plea bargain Exxon stock still managedto close up $1.   This is hardly the first case in recent years whereprosecutors criminalized noncrimes. In the environmentalarea, there was also John Pozsgai's conviction and three-yearjail term for violating the wetlands laws by daring to cleartires and rusted auto parts off his landfill. We also sawoverreaching in many of the Wall Street prosecutions of the1980s, memorialized most recently by the reversal this weekby federal appeals judges of the GAF stock-manipulationconviction.   Exxon, which already spent more than $2 billion to cleanup the oil spill, should be civilly liable for all the lossesit caused. There are even good arguments to have a lawexpressly aimed at creating fines -- though probably notcrimes -- to protect wildlife from oil spills and otherenvironmental accidents. But no such law is on the books,despite the plea agreement the Justice Department forced onExxon.   The Justice Department is supposed to practiceprosecutorial discretion. This includes equal protection anddue process, even for huge corporations, even when they causegreat environmental damage. Justice is too precious acommodity to be polluted by selective prosecution.   ---                   Oil Spill as Poaching                                                                                                          These are excerpts from the Migratory Bird-Treaty Act of1916:                                                                                                          Unless and except as permitted by regulations . . . itshall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner,to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take,capture or kill, possess . . . sell . . . barter . . .purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, export, import . . .deliver for transportation . . . carry . . . receive . . .any migratory bird, any part, nest, or egg of any such bird .. . included in the terms of the conventions between theUnited States and Great Britain for the protection ofmigratory birds concluded August 16, 1916.</TEXT></DOC>
