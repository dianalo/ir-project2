It calls for special shareholder rights to be distributed June 27 to stock of record on that date.    The maker of systems for processing financial documents said it doesn't know of any efforts to take over the company.    The measure would allow shareholders to buy BancTec stock at half price if a hostile bidder acquires 35% of the company's stock or if the company is merged with a holder owning at least 20% of its stock, among other terms. </TEXT></DOC>
