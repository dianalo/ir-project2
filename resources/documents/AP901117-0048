WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO's top military commander in Europesays he welcomes the new conventional arms accord, but that he'sconcerned some Soviet weaponry already removed from Eastern Europewon't be destroyed under the treaty.   The treaty does not take effect until its signing, scheduled forMonday in Paris.   Moscow has said it has already moved 20,000 tanks, 24,000artillery pieces and 800 aircraft to east of the Ural Mountains,out of the treaty area between those mountains and the Atlantic.   ``They are a concern to me,'' U.S. General John Galvin saidFriday. ``They are not in an offensive deployment (but that does)not take away my worries,'' Galvin, NATO's top commander in Europe,told reporters.   But he and other NATO officials welcomed the Conventional Forcesin Europe accord, finalized by negotiators from the 16 NATO and sixWarsaw Pact nations on Thursday, as a political and militarymilestone.   One official said Moscow ``is aware of our concerns'' that arms,subject to be removed under the CFE treaty, do not remainoperational east of the Urals.   ``We have been given assurances'' this will not happen, said theofficial, who asked not to be named. He said North Atlantic TreatyOrganization will remain ``vigilant'' and monitor the situation.   NATO officials say the Soviet arms already transferred to eastof the Ural Mountains are in unprotected storage and bound todeteriorate.   The CFE treaty is to be signed Monday by the leaders of the NATOand Warsaw Pact nations in Paris in the margin of a 34-nationEast-West summit.   Only days later, the NATO and Warsaw Pact states will open talkson a follow-up accord on troop levels across Europe.   The CFE treaty will bring about, over three years, a 40 percentcut in battle tanks, armored cars, artillery, combat planes andassault helicopters.   In all, 100,000 such items are to go - 90,000 on the Warsaw Pactside, mostly the Soviet Union, and 10,000 on NATO's - leaving250,000 such arms systems in place overall.   The CFE treaty provides for verification of efforts to destroyweapons to ensure each alliance will end up with no more than20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored cars, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters within the treatyarea.</TEXT></DOC>
