Mediator</HEAD><DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government Wednesday issued aformal protest to Israel over the 1948 slaying of U.N. mediatorFolke Bernadotte by the Jewish underground Stern Gang. A formermember said the killing was justified.   Israel's ambassador to Sweden was called to the Foreign Officeand handed a note expressing the government's ``shock,dissatisfaction and indignation that Israel has not reacted afterthe new reports about the murder,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said.   In interviews broadcast and published over the weekend, membersof the now-defunct Israel Freedom Fighters, also known as the SternGang, acknowledged they were involved in the shooting death ofBernadotte on Sept. 17, 1948.   They said Bernadotte, a Swedish count who was on a U.N. missionin Palestine, was slain because of his plan to give the UnitedNations control over Jerusalem and hand over key areas to theArabs. The group was a splinter faction of the right-wing NationalMilitary Organization.   Since the slaying, the group has been widely believed to beresponsible, but the killers were never found despite a widespreadmanhunt.   Ambassador Moshe Erell told reporters after the meetingWednesday that Israel expressed its regrets immediately after theslaying and had not changed its position, national radio reported.   He made no comments during the meeting with Ambassador TorstenOhrn, head of the Foreign Office Political section, the radioreported.   In 1945, Bernadotte led an International Red Cross operationthat rescued 30,000 concentration camp victims from Germany andresettled them in Sweden.   Yisrael Scheib-Eldad, a former member of the Stern Gang, toldIsrael radio Wednesday the killing prevented ``a disaster forJerusalem and the state of Israel.''   ``I'm not saying every assassination is good but this one wasgood. I want to state that 40 years later. An act of individualterror can be good and bad. In this case, it was good,'' saidEldad, who has not claimed to be involved in the slaying.   The underground group was named after leader Avraham Stern, whowas killed by British police in 1942. The group then was jointlyheaded by Eldad, the late Natan Yellin-Mor and Yitzhak Shamir, whois now Israel's prime minister.   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir has denied the premier wasinvolved in the killing and contended the group was officiallydisbanded about four months before Bernadotte's death.</TEXT></DOC>
