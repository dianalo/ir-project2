Col. Oliver North was pondering how to commit the network of ships, planes and operatives he called &quot;Democracy Inc.&quot; to a new mission in Angola.    &quot;Ollie wanted to roll on with the Iranian initiative, and he also clearly had in mind working toward Angola,&quot; says retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who ran the private arms network on Col. North's behalf. No arms were ever delivered to Angola rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, Gen. Secord said in an interview this week, but administration and intelligence officials confirm that, as one put it: &quot;Angola was a constant refrain with Ollie.&quot;    As the first round of the Iran-Contra hearings ended this week, new evidence of Col. North's fascination with the fight against Angola's Marxist regime reflects his ambition that &quot;the enterprise&quot; could grow beyond the Iran and Contra operations. Testimony reveals that the corporate structure he helped to create stretched from Switzerland to Panama to Liberia in what amounted to a private intelligence agency that has astonished lawmakers with its intricacy and its exploits.    Col. North and his partners negotiated sweeping changes in U.S. foreign policy, delivered tons of supplies to the Contras and harvested millions of dollars in profits. More than $8 million remains in foreign banks, not counting millions of dollars in assets and a string of lesser investments, including an interest in a company that makes machine guns that can fire 177 rounds in six seconds from a briefcase.    &quot;It was sort of a junta within the executive branch,&quot; said Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.), a member of the Senate investigating committee. &quot;It had this quasi private-public character which really allowed it to maximize its advantages . . . All of this was unaccountable. Secord denied he was trying to run a private CIA but that is in effect what they were doing.&quot;    Testimony last week revealed that in a last effort to keep alive an opening to Iran, Col. North's associates said the U.S. would help to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and go to war with the Soviet Union if it invaded Iran.    &quot;I thought it was appalling,&quot; says Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs. &quot;I thought I had heard everything in this tale, but it keeps getting worse. The idea that you could negotiate with another country through CIA annuitants, a retired general, and an Iranian businessman only a recently naturalized citizen is shocking. This violates all precepts of how to conduct serious diplomacy.&quot;    The network's organizers respond that they could act more quickly and creatively than the CIA or the Pentagon. &quot;The system has to be unlocked, and I'm not holding my breath until we get a president who's strong enough to do that,&quot; says Gen. Secord.    The memory of Vietnam, where virtually all the military officers in the network served, plays a part in shaping this outlook. The war was a bitter lesson in the strength of modern Soviet-backed forces, and it left these officers with an attitude of disdain for Congress and the press. Five years later, the disastrous attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran helped convince Gen. Secord and Col. North that the Pentagon wasn't serious about unconventional operations, and this conviction made going outside official channels even more tempting.    &quot;It was very easy for these people to talk themselves into the position where whatever they do is justified,&quot; says one senior House Democrat. &quot;It's so seductive and dangerous in a society like ours.&quot;    In separate conversations, a senior intelligence official and a top congressional investigator each compared Col. North and his colleagues to &quot;the Algerian colonels,&quot; the group of French military officers who in 1958 tried to overthrow the French government because they feared its policies would lead to the loss of France's most important North African colony. &quot;These people were dangerous,&quot; says the intelligence official.    In Vietnam, the American advisers who replaced the French referred disparagingly to their South Vietnamese allies as &quot;the little people.&quot; The same impatience is found in the network's dealings with the Contra leadership. As deeply committed as Col. North was to the insurgents' cause, he and his associates increasingly took it upon themselves to run the war, as had the CIA before them.    &quot;The heavy hand of the gringo is needed,&quot; wrote Robert Owen, who served as a courier between the White House and the Contra leadership. Gen. Secord testified that fears of corruption among Contra leaders contributed to Col. North's decision in 1985 to take back control of the funds available to the guerrillas.    But, as the first round of congressional hearings disclosed, Col. North's ambitions weren't limited to Iran and the Contras. Gen. Secord says the fired National Security Council aide asked him whether he had ever met Mr. Savimbi, and once inquired whether the C-123 transport planes being used to deliver aid to the Contras could be useful in Angola.    Col. North has refused any comment on the unfolding Iran-Contra affair but is expected to testify next month under a grant of immunity approved last week by the investigating committees. Gen. Secord may be recalled for further questioning because of contradictions between his testimony and that of other witnesses and other information obtained by the committees.    Col. North and his partners made one effort to diversify last April, Gen. Secord told the congressional panels. After the U.S. bombed Libya on April 14, 1986, Col. North wanted to accelerate a plan, approved by President Reagan the previous January, to expand CIA-backed propaganda broadcasts to Libya. A five-year-old, CIA-backed Libyan exile radio station now located in Chad can't reach most of the Libyan population along the Mediterranean coast.    But the CIA said it could take up to two years to set up a floating radio station, and the Navy's Sixth Fleet refused to put a clandestine propaganda and disinformation operation on any of its ships. So the Iran-Contra network bought a Danish freighter and Col. North twice offered it to CIA operations director Clair George for $200,000 a month, according to intelligence sources and an April 28, 1986 memo from Gen. Secord to Col. North released by the investigating committees.    Mr. George declined the offers, but the vessel was used in still another venture, an unsuccessful attempt to free American hostages in Lebanon that was financed by Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot. Col. North also recruited Drug Enforcement Administration agents as part of an effort to buy the freedom of the hostages, and further testimony on this and another DEA operation will be heard this summer.    The private network was still expanding when one of its planes was shot down by a Sandinista missile last October. According to Gen. Secord, the Iranians that same month offered to deposit $40 million in the Frankfurt branch of the Credit Suisse bank to set up a permanent European office to manage the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran. The office would be staffed by Iranians and Americans and Gen. Secord says he privately assured the Israelis that they could &quot;insert an agent or two&quot; into the office. The plan, which could have enabled the network to buy one or two Boeing 707 cargo planes, was never approved by the White House and never got off the ground.    &quot;You had a dangerous combination of mindless patriotism and boundless ambitions,&quot; charges a senior intelligence official. &quot;You had somebody with no political sense who believed in action and you had people who wanted to make big profits.&quot;    Gen. Secord responds with equal contempt. The CIA couldn't match his network, says the veteran of numerous special operations, because &quot;it has shoe clerks in the top positions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
