Technologies Inc.'s audited year end financial statementsshow revenue of $181.3 million compared to the $136.7 million for theprevious fiscal year.andP;  Net income for the year was $13.5 million, or 93 centsper share, down from $16.0 million, or $1.15 per share for last fiscal year.andM;The company also announced revenue for the fourth quarter, ended March 31,1990, or $45.7 million, and net income of 4 cents per share.andP;  This was anincrease of $6.9 million in revenue and a decrease of 29 cents in net incomeper share from the prior fiscal fourth quarter.andM;As a result of a previously announced internal investigation, the companyconcluded, with the concurrence of its external auditors, that its unauditedrevenue and earnings for its second and third quarters of fiscal 1990 shouldbe restated.andP;  This restatement reduced the second and third quarter revenueand net income from those previously reported.andM;The restatement of results for the second quarter, which ended Oct. 1, 1989,relates to the reversal of revenue from one ship- ment, valued atapproximately $519,000, that was made pursuant to an invalid order that wasreceived in late September of 1989.andP;  Re- stated revenue for the secondquarter is $47.2 million and net in- come is $4.9 million, or 34 cents pershare.andM;This represents a $519,000 decrease in revenue and a 2 cents decrease inearnings per share compared with previously reported results.andM;Restated results for the third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 1989, are $46.7million in revenue and $3.1 million in net income, or 21 cents per share.andO;This represents a decrease in revenue of $5.4 million, and an 18 centsdecrease in earnings per share compared with previously reported results.andM;Approximately $1.4 million of this amount was due to shipments made pursuantto the invalid order received in September.andP;  The balance of $4.0 millionrepresented shipments now known to have been made without appropriate orderdocumentation from customers.andM;Subsequently, the company received appropriate order documentation forapproximately $2.4 million of these shipments, and $1.8 mil- lion of suchrevenue is correctly reported in the fourth quarter.andP;  The remaining shipmentsof $1.6 million have been returned and the related revenue reversed.andM;Bruce Smith, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of thecompany, said &quot;We are deeply disappointed with the fiscal year results andthe restatement of quarterly results.andP;  In conjunction with the year-end auditand reporting of results, the company has completed its review of fiscal 1990revenue items.andM;&quot;Our internal investigation concluded that there were a number of instanceswhere company policies regarding orders and shipments were not followed.andO;Accordingly, I have recommended to our board of directors that a SpecialCommittee of outside directors be ap- pointed to investigate thecircumstances leading to the results reported today and to advise the boardon any corrective measures that may be appropriate.andM;The board has acted on this recommendation and the committee's in- quiry isunderway.andM;&quot;A thorough validation of orders in the pipeline and the backlog is underway.andO;In addition, management is taking actions it expects will return the companyto the sound foundation of prior periods.andP;  Establishing a solid basis forlong-term growth will undoubtedly have a short-term effect on revenue andprofits.andM;Management is determined to take such measures as are appropriate to maintainits long-term growth.andP;  As a result of the above, management expects thecompany to operate at a loss or break-even in the near term.andM;&quot;Management remains confident in the fundamental strengths of the networkingmarkets that the company currently serves and is pursu- ing aggressively.andO;The underlying demand for N.E.T.'s products ap- pears to be solid.andP;  Moreover,the company's position should be further enhanced through a number of newproducts scheduled to reach the market this year.andM;We believe that broadening our product line, expanding geographic andcustomer segments, and addressing adjacent, high-value added markets providethe basis for sustained long-term growth in earnings.&quot;andM;Network Equipment Technologies Inc.andM;Condensed Income StatementandM;(Dollars in
