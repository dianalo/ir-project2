Taking a cue from U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, whobriefed the 15 NATO foreign ministers on Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sinitiative, the allies declined to match the Soviet president's movewith a voluntary reduction of their own.   Instead, NATO said it will propose to the nine-nation Warsaw Pactlimits on the forces each country in each alliance can deploy. Talkson cutting the forces are expected early next year.   ``No country should be able to dominate the continent by force ofarms,'' the NATO statement said.   It suggested that no country should have more than a fixed figure_ ``such as 30 percent'' _ of all forces in Europe and called for alimit of about 12,000 tanks in any one country. The Soviets have20,000 tanks in East Germany alone, NATO officials say.   Gorbachev, speaking Wednesday at the United Nations in New York,offered to cut forces over two years in East Germany, Czechoslovakiaand Hungary.   The allies, instead of reciprocating, focused on the 2-1 manpoweredge and 3-1 tank advantage they say the Soviets hold over NATO.   ``The Soviet Union itself possesses more tanks and artillery thanall the other members of the Warsaw Pact and the (NATO) alliancecombined,'' the statement said.   ``We hope that the new thinking in the Soviet Union will open theway for mutual agreement on realistic, militarily significant andverifiable arrangements which enhance security at lower levels,'' itsaid.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said, ``We areproposing a dramatic change in the military situation in Europe,directed to very substantial reductions by about 50 percent to abalanced outcome.''   He said NATO's aim was ``to concentrate on the key offensivesystems which are tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers.''   The United States, which has about 335,000 troops in WesternEurope, also would be affected by the proposed limits.   ``Roughly speaking, NATO is talking about cuts that would leaveus around 95 percent of current levels, and how that would be brokendown among the relevant nations has not been figured out yet,'' saida senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on condition ofanonymity.   The start of a new series of conventional arms talks between theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact has beendelayed by wrangling over human rights at a 35-nation conference inVienna.   But steps taken by Gorbachev to release political prisoners andpermit U.S. psychiatrists next month to examine Soviet mentalinstitutions have raised expectations the Conventional StabilityTalks can begin early next year.   ``We are trying to get done as soon as possible,'' a U.S.official said.   The NATO declaration, which took two years to prepare, wasrevised at the last moment to refer to the reductions Gorbachevannounced Wednesday.   ``It doesn't change the basic concept we've been working on,'' asenior U.S. official said.   For years, the Western allies have complained there is an``asymmetry'' in favor of the Warsaw Pact by virtue of itscommanding edge in tanks, artillery and combat aircraft.   And yet, ``everybody agrees that there is a change occurring inthe Soviet Union, that there is something different'' underGorbachev, said the official who briefed the reporters undercondition of anonymity.   In another development, an internal NATO dispute with Franceapparently was resolved. The French, who participate only in someNATO decisions, wanted 12 non-aligned European countries to be ableto join in reviewing the decisions taken by the 16 NATO allies andthe seven Warsaw Pact members.   But the U.S. official said an agreement was worked out lastweekend that the review could be held in 1992, provided the NATOnations have ``operational automony'' in the negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
