(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL ministry should strike a deal bythe end of the month with one of at least four prospective buyersfor its 2,300-acre Heritage USA complex, its bankruptcy trusteepredicted.   M.C. ``Red'' Benton told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds onThursday that all of the potential buyers want to maintain it as aChristian retreat while allowing the church and cable televisionnetwork to operate as a separate, non-profit corporation.   Benton said he foresees no future for founder Jim Bakker at PTL,either as a legitimate buyer or as a guest on the ministry's cabletelevision program.   Bakker ``has shown no positive evidence he has resources to comeup with a plan'' to buy PTL and his presence on the show would beharmful to the ministry, Benton said. ``He's still floundering outin left field.''   Benton's comments came as a Bakker attorney submitted a formalproposal for Bakker to regain control of the ministry, a newspaperreported today.   Bakker proposes to rent the Heritage Grand Hotel and HeritageIsland water park in Fort Mill, S.C., while buying broadcast timeon the PTL satellite network, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observerreported.   The newspaper said Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis gave the proposalto PTL attorney Joe Allman after Thursday's court hearing.   The newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying the proposalis unacceptable to Benton and Reynolds because Bakker's returnwould seriously damage the ministry's credibility.   Benton said after the hearing that sports entrepreneur GeorgeShinn will submit a plan before the week ends to buy PTL'sproperty, where he would build a sports complex while allowing theministry functions to continue.   Bakker has criticized Shinn's proposal because it would allowalcohol to be sold at the Heritage Grand Hotel.   Bakker said Wednesday that he still intends to regain control ofthe ministry he began building in 1974 and believes he will beaccepted back by PTL's followers despite the sex and money scandalthat surfaced when he resigned in March 1987.   Benton said the only way PTL can survive is if it sells itsproperty and forms a non-profit ministry that is debt free. PTL,with current debts of up to $130 million and assets of $160million, filed for reorganization in June 1987.   Also Thursday, Bakker and his wife, Tammy, began moving into ahouse in Lake Wylie, near PTL's Fort Mill headquarters, said Bakkerattorney James Toms.   Inez Brown, president of the Bring Bakkers Back Club, said in anews release that members of the group leased the $1,000-a-monthhouse for nine months for the Bakkers.</TEXT></DOC>
