But the survey also points up some potential Dukakis weaknesses that the vice president could exploit.    The poll found Mr. Dukakis ahead by 49% to 36% among those considered most likely to vote, and by a slightly larger margin among all registered voters. The Massachusetts governor holds only a slim lead among men, the survey shows, but a huge one among women -- 52% to 28%.    The Democrat's strong position at this early point in the race is fueled by voter perceptions of him as more compassionate and as the stronger leader. When asked whether &quot;Michael Dukakis really cares about people like you,&quot; more than twice as many people said yes as said no; asked the same question about Mr. Bush, voters split evenly.    And by a margin of 52% to 31%, those surveyed believe the Massachusetts governor would be as good as President Reagan &quot;in terms of being a strong leader&quot;; about Mr. Bush, voters were almost evenly split, and even four in 10 Republicans don't feel he would equal Mr. Reagan.    The Dukakis advantage is much less pronounced when voters are asked about specific issues, though they still regard him as better able to handle a variety of domestic issues. By a margin of 41% to 31%, they think the Democrat is better able to reduce the federal budget deficit; by 46% to 38%, they think he is better able to handle &quot;the nation's economic problems&quot;; by 41% to 27%, they think he could better handle the nation's drug problem. On the issue of keeping inflation down, the voters split evenly between the two candidates.    But despite Mr. Dukakis's strong showing, the Journal/NBC poll suggests some vulnerabilities that could provide openings for the vice president.    Chief among these are questions about the Democrat's expertise on and ability to handle foreign affairs. The poll found, for instance, that the vice president holds a wide lead -- 51% to 31% -- on the question of which candidate would be better able to maintain a strong national defense, and an almost equally big margin as the one better able to handle relations with the Soviet Union.    Moreover, four in 10 voters agreed with the statement that &quot;Michael Dukakis is too inexperienced in foreign policy to be a good president,&quot; and voters split evenly when asked who they would rather have in the White House in case of a &quot;sudden crisis&quot; that required &quot;swift, decisive action.&quot;    Gov. Dukakis yesterday picked up the endorsement of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, his strongest critic on foreign policy and national-defense issues during the presidential primaries. Sen. Gore said that Mr. Dukakis has now given a &quot;fuller, more complete&quot; picture of his foreign policy views, and charged that Mr. Bush has &quot;almost forfeited&quot; the right to raise such issues against the Democratic nominee because of the Iran-Contra affair and other Reagan administration foreign-policy failings.    The poll suggests some other avenues of attack that Mr. Bush may pursue. When asked what would worry them more, a president who is too eager for a nuclear arms-control pact or one who might not do enough to get a pact, half of the voters were more worried about a too-eager president and only a third worried more about a too-reluctant one -- suggesting Mr. Bush might want to try to portray his opponent as too eager. And the survey showed that Mr. Dukakis is seen as no more likely than Mr. Bush to preside over a rise in federal income taxes -- an image the vice president will surely try to dent during the campaign.    But Mr. Bush clearly must still address the major concerns about himself before he can begin to capitalize on concerns about his opponent. In the Journal/NBC poll, voters were evenly divided when asked whether they agreed with the statement that &quot;George Bush isn't tough enough to be a good president.&quot;    The poll makes clear the dimensions of Mr. Bush's problems at the moment. He trails Mr. Dukakis in every region of the country -- although he is close on the Democrat's heels in the South. He trails among both union and nonunion households, and leads only among voters with household incomes above $50,000. And he trails by a two-to-one margin among blue-collar voters, and by three to one among Democrats who say they voted for the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1984.    One reason for Mr. Bush's problems is his close identification with the Reagan administration; in the poll, 58% agreed that the next president &quot;should change direction,&quot; while only 33% said he should &quot;continue along the path of Ronald Reagan's policies.&quot; Moreover, President Reagan's veto of the big trade bill because of its notice-of-plant-closing provision has been broadly unpopular with the blue-collar workers that Mr. Bush must attract.    Another reason for Mr. Bush's troubles so far is his inability to capture the support of economic optimists. In the poll, about half of those surveyed said the economy would stay about the same in the next year, while one in four said it would get worse and one in five said it would get better. In most surveys, people who think the economy is getting better disproportionately lean Republican. But in the current poll, they are almost evenly split between the two candidates.    The Journal/NBC poll also asked voters their views on the selection of vice presidential candidates. While many of the names that have been bruited about so far are little-known to the public, a few conclusions do emerge from the poll.    For the Democrats, Ohio Sen. John Glenn would apparently be a plus, with nearly half of all registered voters surveyed saying his presence would make them more likely to vote for a ticket headed by Mr. Dukakis. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in contrast, would be a negative -- more than half of all voters said his presence on the ticket would make them less likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis.    Among the Republicans, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, bested by Mr. Bush in the fight for the nomination, would be a strong choice: 56% of voters would be more likely to vote for the GOP ticket with him on it. But if his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, were the vice presidential nominee, 51% would be less likely to support the ticket. </TEXT></DOC>
