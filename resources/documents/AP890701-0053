(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge's decision to award custody of anorphaned toddler to his mother's longtime female companion angeredthe boy's blood relatives, who also had sought custody.   Susan Bellemare of Duxbury was granted temporary custody of15-month-old Collin Hamilton by a Vermont probate judge Friday.   Bellemare was named the boy's guardian in a will left by SusanHamilton, the child's mother who died in a car accident in May.Hamilton's parents are challenging the will, claiming they orHamilton's sister, Kathleen, would be a better guardian.   ``This other Susan, she is not even blood,'' said Tom Hamilton,Susan's brother, who attended the hearing along with his parents andsister.   ``I have been co-parenting Collin,'' Bellemare, 33, told Judge L.John Cain during the hearing. ``I would parent the child, I wouldlove him, nurture him.''   No one involved in the case would characterize the relationshipbetween the two women, who reportedly exchanged wedding rings. Theywere companions for a dozen years, owned a home together and livedtogether while raising the baby.   Hamilton conceived her son by artificial insemination.   ``We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody,'' said PatrickMonaghan Jr., the lawyer for the grandparents. ``The personforgotten in this proceeding is the child and what is in the bestinterests of the child.''   The boy, dressed in blue denim overalls and placated with cheesesnacks by his grandmother and aunt, was in the courtroom for most ofthe hearing.   Elsa Hamilton, the boy's grandmother, quit her job as a legalsecretary to take care of the child after the car accident that alsoinjured Bellemare.   Bellemare told the judge she had unsuccessfully tried to see theboy at his grandparents' home, but had been prevented from doing so.   Cain asked Bellemare about her health and ability to raise thechild on her own. Bellemare, who used a cane to walk to the witnessstand, said she saw a doctor two weeks ago and was told ``to get onwith my life.   ``I'm back at work, I'm driving. I'm back at home and able toprovide for the child,'' she said, adding that the boy would betended while she worked by the same woman who has cared for himsince he was an infant.   In giving Bellemare temporary custody, Cain also allowed thegrandparents visitation rights.   Attorneys representing he boy's grandparents would not saywhether they planned to appeal the temporary custody order to ahigher court.   Another hearing was set for August to determine whetherHamilton's will is valid.</TEXT></DOC>
