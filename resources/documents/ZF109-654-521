Arf, arf!&quot;, while simultaneously reformattingthe hard disk.)andM;Another damaging type of program is the &quot;logic bomb.&quot;andP;  This is a programwhich lies dormant on a computer system until triggered by a certaincondition.andP;  Damaging viruses most often contain logic bombs of some type.andO;The &quot;Lehigh Virus&quot; waited until it had copied itself four times before tryingto reformat every disk it could get its hooks into.andP;  The benign &quot;MacMag&quot; or&quot;Brandau Virus&quot; waited until March 2, 1988 before delivering its &quot;message ofworld peace.&quot;andM;Robert Slade is an office automation and data communications consultant basedin North Vancouver, B.C., and is national computer security manager for theSuzy information system from Stratford Software Corp. of Burnaby, B.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
