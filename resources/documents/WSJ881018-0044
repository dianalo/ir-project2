The interim agreement was initialed in Washington by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus. As reported, the core of the agreement consists of $481 million a year in U.S. military and economic aid to the Philippines for two years beginning October 1989.    In addition, the U.S. agreed to give the Philippines $500 million in export credits and investment guarantees over three years starting this month. The Philippines also will have the option to convert some of its debt into securities, using already appropriated economic aid amounting to $248 million over the two years ending September 1989 and a &quot;substantial portion&quot; of the $160 million in economic aid to be appropriated for the year beginning October 1989. These figures haven't been reported earlier.    In return, the Americans can continue to use six military installations in the Philippines, including Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Station, both among the biggest U.S. bases overseas.    Although the amount of U.S. aid offered is substantially less than Mr. Manglapus sought, it is far above the current $180 million the Philippines receives annually from the U.S. in aid and rent for the bases, and is much more than the U.S. originally offered. Some Western diplomats hope the spirit of compromise can continue into the more substantive issue of retaining the bases beyond 1991.    Neither side has indicated a date for talks on a possible new bases agreement. But several diplomats and academics believe the next round could begin early next year. No one predicts easy sailing. The talks on the interim package have generated bad feelings on both sides. During the course of public-relations offensives, officials from both countries began to talk in terms of the growing likelihood of an eventual bases pullout.    Many Filipinos viewed U.S. officials as overly legalistic and unwilling to aid a friend in need. Some American officials and politicians began to see Mr. Manglapus as being motivated by personal embitterment toward the U.S.    The next round of talks will bring further complications. To begin with, the two sides differ on whether the bases agreement automatically ends in 1991, as the Philippine government believes, or must be preceded by a year's notice of termination, as U.S. officials maintain.    Philippine politicians could generate even bigger obstacles. Already, the Philippine Senate has passed legislation that bans nuclear weapons in the country, and many senators have become vocal opponents of the bases.    The anti-nuclear bill has little chance of passing the lower house of the Congress, which is much more conservative and supportive of government policy than the Senate. However, under the Philippine constitution, the Senate must ratify a new bases treaty, and it could unilaterally block an agreement that doesn't address the alleged transport to and storage in the U.S. bases of nuclear weapons. The Senate also could refuse to pass any legislation that doesn't provide stronger guarantees of Philippine sovereignty and control over the bases.    Philippine public opinion could in turn guide the thinking of many politicians. A largely leftist, anti-bases coalition has been hammering away at the bases for years and appears to be gaining adherents. Even the country's middle class has begun to question the U.S. presence, as an increasing number of Filipinos grapple with nagging issues of national identity.    Political analysts say that to sell any new agreement, it must contain a clause that would set a date for at the very least the winding down of the U.S. bases.    ---   Eduardo Lachica in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
