The service is operated by Energy Information Investments Ltd., a newly formed Cayman Islands company. For $10,000 to $250,000 a year, oil-exporting nations, major oil companies and others can receive an information service tailored to the clients' needs under the name &quot;OPEC Listener-Real-Time Analysis.&quot;    Behind the birth of the OPEC Listener during last week's OPEC meeting in Vienna is a bizarre chain of events, including mass defections from Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, or PIW. A $15 million lawsuit has been filed, and several of the world's biggest publishing companies have become indirectly involved.    For decades, the New York-based PIW has been considered by many to be the &quot;bible&quot; of the oil industry. Only coincidentally, the weekly newsletter of eight to 12 pages is printed on thin, crisp, yellow-tinted paper typically used for Bibles.    It was founded 27 years ago and is still published by Wanda Jablonski -- a friend of Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi Arabian oil minister, and of other Mideast sheiks and kings long before the oil crises of the 1970s brought them to world attention.    With 3,000-plus subscribers paying $1,150 annually, PIW is a cash machine. It had been considered a publishing gem because of its staff of top energy journalists and had drawn attention of some big publishers, including the U.S. affiliate of Lord Thomson of Canada.    International Thomson Business Press almost bought PIW in a $15 million transaction to have been completed May 31. But Thomson backed out and, by Memorial Day, five staffers had given notice. By June 1, all but two of 18 people formerly at PIW, excluding Ms. Jablonski, were gone.    After the exodus, Ms. Jablonski sued the recently incorporated Energy Information Investments, which has 14 of her former staffers. Also named were the new company's founders: Barry Jolly, a Cayman Islands accountant, and William Liscom, the former general manager of PIW. The suit seeks $15 million in damages and an order enjoining the company from competing against PIW.    Publishing with a skeleton staff, Ms. Jablonski blames Mr. Liscom. &quot;He was the ringleader, and it is clear to me now he was planning a takeover for quite some time,&quot; she says.    Mr. Liscom denies that. &quot;My actions at PIW were directed solely to the best interests of the company and of the employees,&quot; he says. Economist, computer expert and a former vice president of Chase Bank, Mr. Liscom was a consultant to PIW before becoming its general manager in March 1987. He says he submitted his resignation two months before the mass defections to devote more time to consulting duties elsewhere.    Other former PIW staffers support Mr. Liscom. They say morale and working conditions had deteriorated at PIW for several years. Employees assumed for years they would eventually inherit the publication, but a trust set up for that purpose was allowed to lapse into limbo. A pension fund was terminated. Expenses were tightly controlled. A former London staffer covering OPEC says he took charter flights to the meetings. A promised bonus-incentive plan for new PIW products fizzled.    &quot;This event (the resignations) is the culmination of three years of building frustration,&quot; says Marshall Thomas, a former executive editor of PIW who had given notice before the mass defections to start PetroMar, an oil-market analysis firm.    Other ex-staffers say the resignations of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Liscom brought things to a climax. Ms. Jablonski decided to take up the Thomson group on a standing offer to buy PIW without telling her staff. Ex-staffers say they suspected something when three accountants -- said to be conducting an &quot;IRS audit&quot; -- came to PIW offices in late April to check the books.    When finally told PIW had been sold, former employees insist they welcomed the prospective new owner. &quot;Then, they (Thomson) said they had withdrawn after finding the operation very fragile,&quot; says a former staffer of PIW. &quot;We were devastated,&quot; adds another.    Other companies inquired about purchasing PIW, including a Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. unit and such oil industry-related firms as Petroleum Finance Co. of Washington and John S. Herold Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.    Ms. Jablonski won't identify a purchaser, but says the field is narrowed to three.    Former staffers say she rejected their proposal of an employee leveraged buy-out. Several prepared to resign as of May 31, the date targeted for completing a sale. That day, a prospective purchaser made a day-long presentation to the PIW staff. The remaining resignations took place after the former staffers say they saw &quot;multiple problems with this favored buyer, including a potential conflict-of-interest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
