A chain reaction of Palestinian terrorism, State Department and intelligence officials say, would provoke even harsher reactions from the Israelis, relieve the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to negotiate with the Arabs, and wipe out any sympathy the Palestinians have earned within Israel and abroad.    Nevertheless, U.S. intelligence officials believe just such counterproductive terrorism may be inevitable. They say Palestinian groups, including several allied with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, began plotting terrorist acts in the occupied territories more than a year ago. Having been caught off guard by the grass-roots unrest in the West Bank and Gaza, Mr. Arafat and his rivals may try to bolster their credibility with young rioters by launching terrorist attacks against Israel.    &quot;The PLO has got to reassert control,&quot; says one administration analyst. &quot;Arafat's only recourse is to demonstrate that the PLO is as committed to armed struggle, as willing to die, as the 12-year-olds who are throwing rocks.&quot;    The PLO already has claimed responsibility for the bus hijacking last week in which three Arabs and three Israelis died. Israeli authorities also found and defused a car bomb a short distance from the Jerusalem hotel where Secretary of State George Shultz stayed during his recent Mideast peace mission.    An attack on Mr. Shultz would have been so damaging to the Arab cause that some U.S. intelligence officials fleetingly pondered if the Israelis might have planted the bomb themselves in a byzantine plot to discredit the Palestinians. But they quickly concluded the bomb was planted by Arab terrorists.    Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials are still trying to figure out the origins of the bomb, which used a Czechoslovakian plastic explosive called Semtex-H, a favorite of terrorist groups, many of which stockpile it around Beirut. Among the candidates: Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Lebanese Shiite terror group Hezbollah, and Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.    &quot;We don't think either the Syrians or the PLO would want to blow away the Secretary of State,&quot; says one U.S. analyst. &quot;But there are plenty of other people out there who might.&quot;    A number of terrorist groups, some of them backed by Syria, Libya, or Iran, are competing for attention and for the loyalty of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Al-Fatah, the mainstream PLO organization, now has at least three clandestine terrorist groups, all led by close associates of Mr. Arafat, U.S. intelligence officials say.    Another reason for concern is the emerging alliance of Palestinian nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism. The Palestinians are Sunni Moslems, not Shiites, but the teeming refugee camps in Gaza are as fertile a breeding ground for radical ideas as the Shiite slums of south Beirut.    Indeed, one of the U.S. government's best Mideast analysts worries that the history of Lebanon's Hezbollah may be repeating itself in the occupied territories. Embittered young Palestinians, he fears, have rejected traditional leaders such as Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij and may abandon secular figures such as Mr. Arafat. Sunni radicalism may have as much appeal for young Palestinians as the Iranian revolution has had for Lebanese Shiites. Repression by the Israelis only provides a catalyst for the process.    Not everyone is so pessimistic. William Quandt of the Brookings Institution argues that neither Mr. Arafat nor his main rival for PLO control, Syrian President Hafiz al-Assad, has any incentive to resort to terrorism now. The al-Quds Radio, which broadcasts to the Palestinians from southern Syria, has been urging restraint, he notes, and some PLO leaders who usually are at one another's throats have been working together to try to harness the unrest. Escalating violence isn't inevitable, but the sorry history of relations between Israel and the Palestinians offers little cause for hope. </TEXT></DOC>
