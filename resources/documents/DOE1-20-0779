The occurrence of oil andgas is strictly controlled by the degree of maturity of organic matter.According to the color alteration index of conodont, Ordovician of thebasin is divided into mature zone (low value zone, CAI {le} 2), highlymature zone (Middle value zone, CAI = 3 to 4.5) and over-mature zone(high value zone, CAI = 5 to 6). Since the basin is at the stage of highmaturity and early over-maturity, the target of exploration within thebasin is mainly natural gas. The most promising area for gas explorationis in the east of Sichuan. 5 references, 5 figures, 5 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
