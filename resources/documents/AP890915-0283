Several newspapers have reported that the Resolution Trust Corp.would sue Lincoln, its parent American Continental Corp. of Phoenixand officers of both companies.   Stephen Pizzo, co-author of ``Inside Job,'' a book about fraudamong Sandamp;Ls, said sources had told him the 150-page complaint wasreadied six weeks ago but stalled when Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. lawyers took it to their counterparts in the JusticeDepartment for approval.   FDIC spokesman David Barr in Washington denied knowledge of anypending action against against the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift orAmerican Continental.   The Resolution Trust Corp. was established under the sweepingthrift bailout which President Bush signed into law Aug. 9.   The Los Angeles Times and the Orange County (Calif.) Registerreported Thursday that the suit might invoke the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations statute, which allows tripledamages in civil cases.   American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. could not bereached for comment Thursday. In the past the company has denied anywrongdoing.   The suit will allege misconduct in transactions involving atax-sharing plan, the high-yield corporate securities known as junkbonds, a hotel in Detroit, a Dallas company and three Arizonacommunities, Pizzo and others said.   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14. It now is undercontrol of the RTC, and analysts said the Lincoln crisis will be thenew agency's costliest bailout.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, has said $1.5 billion had been lost ``in the Lincolnfiasco'' and that discovery of further losses was inevitable.   The government took over Lincoln the day after AmericanContinental filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law.   Keating and his advisers also face a dozen class-action suitsfiled by about 23,000 bondholders. American Continental hasresponded by suing the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and FDIC toremove Lincoln from federal conservatorship.   In another development, a rating newsletter in Coral Gables,Fla., listed Lincoln as the worst-performing thrift in the nation,with $787.9 million in losses for the April-June quarter.   Bauer Financial Reports Inc. said Lincoln accounted for 16percent of the losses incurred by the 939 Sandamp;Ls that ran in the red.</TEXT></DOC>
