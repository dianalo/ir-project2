Emitted particulate materials diffuse intothe working place, and contaminate the atmosphere. These diffused particulatesenter into organisms and the healths are damaged by specific propertiesof particulate materials and reaction with the organisms. In order toget correct informations on dusts deposited in lung, it is importantto take samples from some lungs and analyze the interaction between dustsand organisms. Some processes such as introducing into macrophage, repeatingthe fibroplasia and resulting the lesion to pneumoconiosis, are thoughtto occur. Silica minerals such as quartz and cristabalite were foundto have stronger toxity than other dusts by examining the cytotoxityof minerals' dusts. The Japan Society Of Industrial Hygiene classifiedallowable dust concentration into three groups, that is, dusts containing10% or more free silicate, dusts containing free silicate less than 10%and dusts containing asbestos.
