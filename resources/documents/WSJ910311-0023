The banking company, which reported a fourth-quarter lossof $34.4 million that wiped out shareholder equity, said&quot;interested private investors&quot; will inject several milliondollars into the bank if it gets federal assistance. In the1989 fourth quarter, Dartmouth had a loss of $26.3 million.For all of 1990, the Hooksett, N.H., bank posted a loss of$85 million in contrast to a loss of $42.4 million in 1989.</LP><TEXT>   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials have targetedNew Hampshire as a testing ground for public-privatepartnerships because the state's five largest independentbanks have been severely weakened by losses stemming from thereal-estate slump in the region. The hope is that a capitalinfusion to keep banks alive will cost the government lessthan it does when banks fail and have to be seized.   However, Dartmouth's application must still be reviewed bythe FDIC and federal assistance isn't certain.   A federal regulator said that at least one other NewHampshire bank, which he wouldn't identify, is holding talkswith the FDIC on a public-private capital infusion in whichthe private capital would come from another bank holdingcompany.   Christopher Gallagher, counsel to the New HampshireBankers Association, said Dartmouth's application forassistance could help ease the state's banking problems.&quot;It's a good sign, it's a start. But there's lots more togo,&quot; he said.   Dartmouth, New Hampshire's third largest bank with assetsof $977 million at the end of 1990, wouldn't identify theexact amount of new private capital it has been offered oridentify the potential private investors, although it saidthey weren't banks. Robert Keller, president and chiefexecutive, said, &quot;We don't have all the capital we need. . .. We're working to fill in the gap of what's necessary.&quot; Thebank wants as much private capital as possible to reduce theamount of federal capital needed to make the recapitalizationviable, Mr. Keller added. Based on its size, Dartmouth wouldneed about $30 million of new capital to meet minimumregulatory requirements.   &quot;The current economic situation isn't going to lastforever,&quot; Mr. Keller said. &quot;The investors that are interestedin our bank see the state's potential down the road as anopportunity. This would be a long-term solution to ashort-term problem.&quot;   He added that Dartmouth has had &quot;informal discussions&quot;with other banks in New Hampshire regarding a merger,although that isn't part of the proposal it has made to theFDIC. Regulators have said that New Hampshire, like someother parts of the country, has too many banks and that partof the solution to the problem may be mergers.   Dartmouth said that any capital infusion would give newinvestors &quot;a priority position&quot; and that existingshareholders &quot;may end up with little or no ownership of therecapitalized bank.&quot;   Dartmouth had a loan-loss reserve of $28.5 million andnonperforming assets of $147.9 million at the end of 1990.Shareholder equity was a negative $11.8 million.</TEXT></DOC>
