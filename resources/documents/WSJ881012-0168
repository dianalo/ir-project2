But three weeks after a military junta took power and began shooting anti-government protesters, Burma's future looks much less certain. The country is preparing to hold its first multiparty elections in a quarter-century, but it isn't clear if those polls will be free enough to produce a representative government.    It is clear that the current government and any that succeeds it will have a struggle revitalizing the country. The picture of Burma that emerges from discussions with diplomats and other analysts in Bangkok, the capital of neighboring Thailand, and by telephone from Rangoon, the capital of Burma, is one of a people groping to break out of a stultifying economic, social and political system that transformed one of Asia's most thriving nations into one of its most destitute.    &quot;Even the government recognizes the need for change, but the key thing is: What's acceptable change?&quot; says a diplomat in Bangkok. &quot;You never know what's unacceptable until the troops come out on the streets.&quot;    The junta, Burma's fourth government in three months, has suppressed huge anti-government protests, re-exerted control over most of the country and forced people to return to work. The crackdown follows six months of mass protests and an extended general strike that disrupted economic and administrative activity. Some public services have resumed and food supplies in the capital are up.    Three weeks of tough military response to the mass protests, with casualties estimated in the thousands, has cowed the public. The slaughter has sent thousands of radical students fleeing to join insurgents in the border areas.    The death toll also has deepened resentment of the military clique that has ruled Burma since 1962, when former dictator Ne Win staged a military coup against the country's fledgling democracy. &quot;The army can stop demonstrations, stop people striking and stop them from printing anti-government posters and independent newspapers. But it's difficult to actually make people work,&quot; says a Western diplomat in Rangoon.    The latest regime, headed by Prime Minister and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Saw Maung, promises to relinquish power to a democratically elected government. Multiparty elections to bring that outcome have been an opposition demand.    Under a 1974 constitution, Ne Win's Burma Socialist Program Party was the only party allowed. Ne Win relinquished power in late July but is believed to still pull the strings. Few observers expect the promised elections to be untainted. &quot;You can't expect free and fair democratic elections when the military elite's been used to having its way for 26 years,&quot; says a diplomat in Rangoon. But if opposition leaders participate, they might win representation, and that might defuse popular sentiment for radical change, he says.    Burma's resource-rich economy has been sputtering for years. Centralized state control of most economic activity has led to widespread shortages. The black market has become a mainstay and smuggling has cut official foreign trade, causing foreign-exchange earnings to plummet and making it difficult to acquire essential spare parts and raw materials.    Conditions worsened after Ne Win stepped down. As government control weakened amid nationwide dissent, looters broke into factories and warehouses, stealing or destroying much of the contents. Gasoline, already scarce before the disturbances, has become even more rare and expensive. Burma's largest oil refinery was badly damaged by protesters.    The government's management style has long been a problem; officials usually were promoted for their loyalty to Ne Win rather than their expertise. Such problems worsened in recent weeks as the military regime purged officials who joined in anti-government marches. Hundreds of civil servants have been arrested or fired, Reuters news service reported.    Burma's foreign-exchange woes are also growing. Most aid donors have cut off assistance to protest the repression. Though foreign aid, at $416 million a year, is comparatively small, it is sizable to the cash-strapped country.    While opposition politicians are being allowed to run in the promised election, Reuters reported they were complaining of harassment by army personnel. Diplomats don't discount the possibility that elections could be scrapped altogether.    &quot;If they postpone the elections, I think it could elicit a violent reaction,&quot; says the diplomat residing in Rangoon. &quot;But the longer the situation goes on without major violence, the more it seems like there will be sullen acquiesence.&quot; After all, he noted, submitting to Ne Win's dictates is &quot;an old habit&quot; for Burmese. </TEXT></DOC>
