Proxy materials for the May 26 annual meeting indicate the company's chairman and chief executive officer, A.W. Clausen, received a $200,000 bonus atop his $575,000 base annual salary. The chief financial officer, Frank Newman, and vice chairman, Richard Rosenberg, received even larger bonuses, the proxy indicates, but much of it conformed with previously reported employment contracts. Mr. Newman earned a total of $708,333; Mr. Rosenberg took home $694,574.    The bonuses are awarded to executives who &quot;achieve superior performance,&quot; according to the proxy, and were &quot;probably low compared with peer banks,&quot; a bank spokesman said.    BankAmerica reported that it paid $10.2 million in employee bonuses for the three years ended last Dec. 31, a period during which the bank incurred net losses totaling $1.8 billion. The 1987 results included a $1.1 billion provision for Third World debt. </TEXT></DOC>
