Apparently referring to news accounts that described his trip asthemeless, disoriented and jumbled, Bush said:   ``It's a very important thing for a president to get outside theWhite House and move around this country. Some of the friends thatwe were traveling with didn't seem to understand that. But I cantell you that I learned a lot from it. And it was a very good thingto do and I'm going to keep doing it.''   The trip was timed to project Bush as an active problem-solverjust as the media assess his first 100 days of his presidency, aWhite House aide said Thursday.   Although Bush has said he is indifferent to the milestone,``he's making these appearances even before some of these 100-daystories are getting out,'' said the official. He discussed thestrategy on grounds of anonymity.   Other White House aides called the trip a success, despite anaura of confusion caused by scheduling foul-ups and unfocusedpresidential speeches.   ``Sometimes just the idea of getting out of ... Washington ispart of the president's responsibility and role,'' chief of staffJohn Sununu said Thursday. ``He really feels it's important for himto go out and let the folks see him. The president gets a lot outof it.''   Sununu conceded that Bush's speeches on several occasionsgarnered little coverage on the heavily watched national televisionevening news shows. But he said ``you don't always focus just ontrying to get 15 seconds or 30 seconds on the national news. Theregional aspect is very critical.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied that Bush'strip lacked any overriding theme the nation could focus on, sayingthat ``the theme is building a better America.''   Bush began the trip Monday by attending a memorial service inNorfolk, Va., for the 47 victims of the USS Iowa explosion. thiswas added to an already-heavy schedule Monday that had Bushdeclaring himself off to ``a good start'' in a speech to AssociatedPress newspaper publishers in Chicago.   The trip took Bush to Illinois, North Dakota, California, Texasand Florida.   ``He wanted to get to California to talk about some of the majorissues,'' such as research and development for high technology anda reduction in the capital gains tax. But Bush dropped plans totalk about offshore oil drilling because of the Valdez oil spill,aides said privately.   Sununu said Bush had been especially determined to hit hard onthe administration's campaign to attack drug abuse.   ``Most Americans feel it's a critical issue,'' the chief ofstaff said, ``and he wants to make sure he can do what he can tohelp coordinate.''   As part of that attempt, Bush visited a 213-acre ranch in theOrange County hillside that had been turned into a sophisticateddrug-trafficking clearinghouse, replete with hidden chutes and trapdoors to conceal the merchandise.   On Thursday, before flying home to Washington, he sat at one ofa dozen multi-screen consoles at a Coast Guard drug-interdictioncommunications center in Miami and watched a simulated drug bust inwhich narcotics-running boats and planes were tracked andapprehended.   Bush has sought to minimize the significance of reaching the100-day threshold, which will arrive Sunday, saying he succeeded aman he served for eight years as vice president and that he neverintended substantial changes in the first months of his presidency.   Sununu said the next 100 days will see Bush heavily involved inthe NATO summit in Brussels and the seven-nation economic summit inParis in July. Also, he said, Bush will focus heavily on trying topush ahead with a more lasting budget-deficit agreement and willwork to see through Congress his proposals to save the beleagueredsavings and loan industry.   The president also likely will spend time defending an expectedveto of legislation that Congress is expected to pass, raising theminimum wage from the current $3.35-an-hour rate to $4.65. Bushbelieves the rate should be no higher than $4.25.   Sununu acknowledged that a package of crime legislation toassist in the drug-crusade is not yet ready for announcement by theWhite House or introduction in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
