HARPAZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Susan Saltrick, her husband and 3-week-olddaughter are unlikely refugees _ affluent New Yorkers who leftbehind Japanese prints and a thousand prized books to take shelterin a rent-free apartment that is anything but home.   Even less likely, they and 350 neighbors, also cast from theirhomes, have hired a public relations firm to try to persuade ``60Minutes'' to focus on their plight.   But their misfortune is very real. On Aug. 19, a steam pipewrapped with asbestos exploded, showering their neighborhood withpotentially cancer-causing fibers and rendering them homeless.   They left behind possessions collected over lifetimes. Theysuffer anxiety and depression. And they have no idea when or if theywill return to their contaminated homes.   ``You try real hard to keep up a good face and be strong andtough and get through it all,'' said Saltrick, who gave birth 12days after the blast. ``We're alive, we're healthy, my daughter isfine, you basically have your health and that's pretty important.But I do get depressed, worrying about where we're going to be.''   Shoeless and pregnant, Saltrick clambered down a fire truckladder when the underground steam pipe blew up in front of herbuilding at 32 Gramercy Park South on the east side of Manhattan.   One of her neighbors, the mother of a 5-month-old boy, was killedwhen steam and debris wrecked her apartment as she napped. Alsokilled were two workers for Consolidated Edison, the electricutility that owns the steam pipes.   A geyser of mud 12 stories high roared like a rocket for fourhours; some residents later sought psychological help for nervesfrazzled by the deafening noise.   Only later did people learn the mud was full of asbestos.   Saltrick and her husband, John Meyer, spent the night at afriend's house. The next day they found their apartment untouched bythe blast and moved back. Saltrick and others turned on airconditioners and vacuumed the dirt they tracked in. Unwittingly,that may have spread asbestos into units that might otherwise haveremained uncontaminated.   Con Ed had tested for asbestos but said nothing about possiblecontamination in the neighborhood. Building managers discovered theasbestos three days later through tests of their own. Lawyers forthe buildings as well as city officials have accused Con Ed of acover-up. The utility has been cited six times since 1988 by theOccupational Safety and Health Administration for allegedly failingto test accurately for asbestos in other cases.   On Aug. 23, Saltrick, Meyer and neighbors were given three hours'notice to leave their homes for what they thought would be a fewdays.   Days turned into weeks. Con Ed spokeswoman Pat Richardi now saysthe buildings should be cleaned up by Thanksgiving. But victims sayCon Ed is again denying reality.   Saltrick and Meyer, with the baby on the way, were counting onselling their one-bedroom cooperative apartment to finance purchaseof a bigger unit. The man who'd agreed to buy Saltrick's co-opbefore the blast has since had mortgage applications rejected by twobanks.   Con Ed is paying about $500,000 a week for the 350 displacedresidents to stay in hotels, eat out every night and replaceessential items _ including computers for some who had worked athome.   Saltrick says Con Ed offered her only $200 to replace all thebaby furniture she left in her apartment. Nine months pregnant, shestood up at a public meeting to complain; the utility agreed to payfor whatever she needed.   But Saltrick didn't want to bring newborn Sarah back to a hotel.One hour before she went into labor, she found a one-bedroomapartment through a company that houses executives on short-termtransfers. Con Ed pays the $2,000 monthly rent.   Everyday, Saltrick contacts Con Ed and her building managers forthe latest on the cleanup. Then she spends hours shopping for thebasics her new apartment lacks: spices, a garbage can, toiletries.Sarah will never get to use the baby-shower gifts still sitting inher old apartment with the toys and crib she and Meyer bought monthsago.   Their $15,000 homeowner's insurance policy won't begin to coverthe rugs, clothes, upholstery and other porous items that will haveto be discarded because they absorbed asbestos fibers. Richardi saysCon Ed expects plenty of hefty claims and lawsuits once the cleanupis complete.   Until 1975, Con Ed wrapped its steam pipes in asbestos to reduceheat loss. Other insulating materials have been used sincescientists determined long-term exposure to the fiber causes cancer.   But no level of exposure to asbestos is considered safe.   ``Doctors are telling these people, `Come back every six monthsfor the rest of your life and I'll let you know if you've beenaffected,''' said David Jaroslawicz, a lawyer who filed a $30million lawsuit against Con Ed on behalf of the building at 151 E.20th St., which was evacuated the same night as Saltrick's building.   The cleanup is an enormous undertaking. Entire buildings havebeen swathed in plastic. Environmental officials hired a specialcompany to decontaminate art objects, antiques and computers.Contractors have even scrubbed down trees.   Dan Sitomer, a lawyer retained by Saltrick's building, says thevictims of Gramercy Park are to be no less pitied because they havethe resources to demand and get the help they need.   ``There's no class system when a disaster strikes,'' he said.``There are only people who have been touched and hurt.''   Sheldon Adler, president of Saltrick's co-op board, is confidentthat Saltrick and other victims will ultimately force Con Ed to makeappropriate restitution.   ``We had the terrible misfortune of having our buildingdamaged,'' he said. ``But Con Ed had the misfortune of running upagainst people who know what they're doing.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 24</NOTE></DOC>
