Method: In case iffuel failure should occur during operation of LMFBR type reactors, itis necessary to specify the failed fuel assembly at an early stage andtake out the same from the reactor core. According to the present invention,gaseous fission products present in the coolants for each of the loopsin the primary coolant circuits are separated and extracted from thecoolants and subjected to gamma-ray measurement. By comparing the resultof the measurement with the previously determined characteristics ofthe distribution ratio, it is possible to specify the position of thefailed fuel assembly in the reactor core, because the primary coolantsdischarged through a specific fuel assembly in the reactor core are distributedto each of the loops in the primary coolant circuits at a distributionratio inherent to the position of that fuel assembly. Accordingly, bypreviously determining the distribution ratio for each of the entirefuel assemblies and by determining the ratio of the measured gamma-rayvalues for each of the loops, the failed assembly can be specified.
