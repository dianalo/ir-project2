The Fed has pushed rates down considerably since the stock market's crash on Oct. 19. But Fed officials, who asked that their names not be used, said the Fed is waiting for further evidence on the economy, and isn't likely to cut the central bank's bellwether discount rate any time soon.    &quot;There's nothing cooking here yet&quot; on the discount rate, said one Fed official. The Fed is holding the key rate at 6% -- the same level as before the stock market's crash -- partly in an attempt to ease the dollar's fall.    Following several days of decline, the dollar rose yesterday after President Reagan said he doesn't want to see it fall further against other currencies. His remark also caused a brief midday rebound in a declining stock market, which was soon overtaken by selling of takeover and buy-out stocks in which financing is pending. The selling was sparked by news that Southland Corp. was having problems in its leveraged buy-out.    The change in the currency market was achieved with talk. The government didn't give any indication that it planned to change the focus of its monetary policy from preventing a recession to supporting the dollar.    Fed officials are generally in accord with statements made recently by Treasury Secretary James Baker, who said that monetary policy should not be used to support the dollar. But they are concerned that if the dollar drops too precipitously, it could renew inflationary fears. It was fear of inflation in the bond market, for the most part, that led to the Fed's decision in early September to boost the discount rate -- the fee it charges on loans to banks -- to 6% from 5.5%.    Some Fed officials are also irritated at the Treasury secretary for making his views public, which has encouraged the decline of the dollar. And they disagree with the administration's belief that an excessively tight monetary policy contributed to the stock market's collapse.    Yesterday Mr. Reagan spoke about the dollar while answering questions on a variety of subjects shouted at him by reporters during a photo session with the president of Israel. Asked about the decline in the dollar, the president said, &quot;We're not doing anything to bring it down.&quot; Asked if he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the current dollar level and its declining trend, he said: &quot;I haven't discussed that with any of our people yet,&quot; but added, &quot;I don't look for a further decline-don't want a further decline . . . from where it is right now.&quot;    The president's comments came during a day when his administration was scrambling to explain the nuances of its own dollar policy, which has seemed contradictory to some in the markets.    Last week, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Secretary Baker made it clear that the administration's primary aim now is to encourage the Fed to keep interest rates low to ward off a domestic recession -- even if it means that a policy of higher interest rates isn't available to help prop up the dollar.    But Mr. Baker continued to express support for currency stability as a general policy. The administration hasn't made any public statements about preferring a lower dollar, or about actively driving it down.    Yesterday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: &quot;The administration is not seeking a lower level for the dollar . . . . We also want to avoid a significant downturn in the economy.&quot;    Earlier in the day, the White House took the unusual step of publicly denying a story in the New York Times that said officials in the White House and elsewhere in the administration, who wouldn't allow the use of their names, &quot;welcomed a weaker dollar&quot; and that the administration wants the dollar to &quot;drift, drift, drift, drift.&quot;    The White House denial said the officials cited by the Times &quot;were not speaking for the administration&quot; and that &quot;the United States continues to cooperate closely with its G-7 allies to promote exchange rate stability.&quot; The so-called G-7, or Group of Seven economic powers, includes the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    Yesterday's administration statements were issued after Mr. Baker expressed concern to the White House about declines in the foreign markets, which officials attributed to the New York Times article. By the end of the day, the talk from Washington had broken the dollar's fall. Nervous currency traders, uncertain where the White House stands, immediately began buying dollars after Mr. Reagan's remark.    In his interview with the Journal last week, Mr. Baker said the administration's top goal was to &quot;make sure&quot; the Fed keeps &quot;sufficient liquidity in the system&quot; to keep the economy from falling into recession in the wake of the stock market crash. He said the U.S. wasn't willing to defend the dollar at the expense of U.S. anti-recessionary monetary policy.    Those remarks were interpreted by some in the markets and the press as a U.S. signal for the dollar to fall. Traders paid less attention to other Baker remarks in the Journal article that showed the Treasury Secretary still favors dollar stability under the right circumstances.    Mr. Baker said he doesn't favor a free fall of the dollar and that too steep a decline might be counterproductive. And, in the interview, Mr. Baker said he hopes soon to negotiate a new G-7 international economic accord that would include as one of its goals the stabilization of exchange rates -- just as last February's Louvre accord stabilized dollar exchange rates until the stock crash. &quot;Stable exchange rates are in the interest of the international financial system -- very much so,&quot; Mr. Baker said last week.    But Mr. Baker believes that any new currency accord shouldn't commit the U.S. to defend the dollar by raising interest rates and risking a recession. And he said any accord must be based on a willingness by all countries to adopt fundamental economic policies that supported the stable exchange rates, such as commitments to growth. He said &quot;it is not in the interest of the United States or other economies, to go through a stabilization exercise that is not supported by underlying fundamentals.&quot;    Some analysts also treated the Journal article, which the White House said reflected the administration's views on the dollar, as a signal of a change in U.S. policy. Administration officials say, however, that the Louvre agreement never explicitly bound the countries to using monetary policy to prop up the dollar.    The Fed's discount rate is largely a symbolic instrument of monetary policy. The Fed can push down market interest rates through its so-called open market operations, by buying securities from banks and thus adding money to the banking system. At the moment, the central bank seems to be walking a narrow line, using &quot;open market&quot; operations to keep rates down, but holding the discount rate stable in an attempt to keep the exchange markets calm. </TEXT></DOC>
