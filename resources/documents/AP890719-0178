Hawaii Island residents were stocking up on batteries, cannedgoods and other emergency supplies as the storm approached from thesoutheast.   Dalilia surprised forecasters Tuesday by turning to the north,putting it on track to pass 70 miles south of Hawaii Island,southernmost in the chain, late Wednesday.   A tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rainwere possible _ remained in effect for Hawaii Island.   At 8 a.m. HST Wednesday, the hurricane was about 230 milessoutheast of Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving west-northwest at about13 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustainedwind speed was 70 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when thatspeed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 85 mph.   Clarence Lee, head of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, saidDalilia was expected to weaken but remain a tropical storm for a fewdays.   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States, manyresidents were buying emergency supplies.   ``They've been buying lots of batteries and canned goods _candles and lamps too,'' said Janice Javar, a cashier at NaalehuFood Center. ``Almost everyone mentions the hurricane.''   Naalehu, with about 5,000 residents, is the closest community toHawaii Island's south tip.   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surfsurged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.   Civil Defense officials closed several seldom-used roads alongHawaii Island's south shore.   ``The purpose is to keep campers out so when the storm hits wedon't have to go in and rescue them,'' said Neil Gyotoku, aspokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense.   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, he said.   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads,Hilo police said no injuries or damage were reported as of lateTuesday.   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, whichbrushed the island of Oahu and roared over of Kauai with wind up to117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.</TEXT></DOC>
