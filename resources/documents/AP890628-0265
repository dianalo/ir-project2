Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced that Banc One will bethe new owner of the MCorp banks but refused to discuss details ofthe transaction before a news conference on Thursday. However,private analysts believe the deal will involve a federal infusion ofabout $2 billion.   If the analysts are correct, MCorp will become the third biggestbank failure, ranking behind Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984and First RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988, which required initialgovernment pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion respectively.   The FDIC, which insures commercial bank deposits, said that BancOne will assume management of the failed banks effective July 5 andits chairman, John B. McCoy, will assume the chairmanship of theMCorp banks under the name of Bank One Texas.   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Banc One agreed in principal toinvest $500 million in the new Texas operation. He declined to sayhow much the government is injecting. The deal likely will becomefinal in four to six weeks, he said.   Banc One's vice president for acquisitons, Bill Boardman, said inColumbus it was not clear how much federal help or overall funds thedeal would require. The bank has made an estimate of the cost, whichhe declined to disclose.   The FDIC will take over problem loans and ``bring the balancesheet to a zero position,'' he said.   Banc One, he added, will manage Banc One Texas for 120 days,identifying the problem loans and inflated assets, before thepurchase is completed.   Banc One, the 25th largest banking company in the nation with$25.3 billion in assets, has pioneered retail innovations and hasbeen one of the five most profitable banks every year since 1984.   It was one of the first banks to offer automated tellers and ithas been a leader in packaging credit card debt into securities forsale to investors. It allocates more of its earnings to research anddevelopment than most banks.   Unlike other large banks, it has shunned participating incorporate buyout deals. Instead, its bread and butter has beencredit cards, auto leasing and student loans. Still, it's had somemissteps. An effort to create a computerized home banking networkfizzled.   With the Texas acquisition, Banc One obtains an extensive branchnetwork with offices in Abilene, Austin, Houston, Fort Worth, Dallasand other cities in the state.   Since March 29, the failed MCorp banks have been governmentowned, operating under the name of The Deposit Insurance BridgeBank, Dallas. That new entity was formed when regulators declared 20MCorp subsidiaries insolvent, leaving five subsidiary banks stilloperating under the private ownership of the original holdingcompany.   Among the other prominent bidders for the failed MCorp banks wereNCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., which bought FirstRepublicBank last year; Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixthlargest banking company; First City Bancorp of Houston, itself therecipient of $1 billion federal bailout in 1987; and the NewYork-based leveraged buyout firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.Early on, San Francisco's Wells Fargo andamp; Co. had also been interestedin the deal, but did not bid.   In a written statement, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman saidonly that Banc One had been selected in ``a highly competitiveprocess'' from among ``attractive proposals.''   Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement, ``We are extremelydisappointed. We've spent an enormous amount of time, resources andeffort on this matter.'' It noted that its proposal would havemaintained an independent bank in Texas.   Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of FirstRepublicBank, said his company was disappointed with the FDIC'sdecision, but said, ``We remain committed to serving the Texasmarket by expanding our franchise throughout the state.''   Analysts have blamed MCorp's failure on the collapse of theenergy market, even though the bank had focused more on real estateloans rather than energy loans. The collapse of oil prices earlierin the 1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regionalrecession in the Southwest.   Seidman has said that MCorp is the agency's last major commercialbank problem remaining. However, the FDIC also is reviewing bids forNational Bancorp. of Texas of San Antonio and Texas AmericanBancshares Inc. of Fort Worth, with combined assets of $7 billion.They are likely to be sold in a package requiring in theneighborhood of $500 million in government assistance.   Last year, the FDIC reported a post-Depression record 221 bankfailures and suffered its first loss since it was established in1934, with reserves dropping from $18.3 billion to $14 billion.Seidman has said he expects the fund to begin rebuilding itsreserves this year.</TEXT></DOC>
