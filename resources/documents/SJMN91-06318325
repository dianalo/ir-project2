Tons of food, clothing and other supplies were collected at adonated warehouse in San Jose and hauled over the Santa Cruz Mountains everyday in Salvation Army trucks to help the quake victims, Eddingfield said.;  He also noted that the Santa Clara Valley community responded generously inboth disasters.;   The county's Salvation Army units report that for theOakland fire, they received $40,000 in cash donations, including $25,000 fromLockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co. employees' &quot;Bucks-of-the-Month&quot; fund, plus$15,000 worth of food and clothing from individual contributors and 22 palletsof fresh produce. About 800 people called the San Jose office to offer help.;  &quot;We also received 7,000 pounds of spaghetti from the Oakland SpaghettiFactory,&quot; Eddingfield said. &quot;They gave it to us because we had a canteen thatcould cook meals.&quot;;   At one time during the East Bay fire disaster, 19Salvation Army canteens from units throughout Northern California wereoperating in that area. Not all of them had full cooking facilities.;   Afterthe first hectic hours, an arrangement was worked out between the SalvationArmy and the American Red Cross for the corps to serve disaster workers andfire victims north of Highway 24 and the Red Cross to serve those south ofthat highway.;   &quot;The Red Cross has been a real friend to us in thisdisaster,&quot; Eddingfield reported to the Salvation Army's San Jose AdvisoryBoard.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DICK COX, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  491  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 13, 199100318325,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
