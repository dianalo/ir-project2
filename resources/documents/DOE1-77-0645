<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0645 </DOCNO><TEXT>An underground counting facility has been designed and constructed toimprove detection of low-level radionuclides. The 3.0 x 4.3 x 2.4 m countingchamber is placed 14.3 m below ground, has 10.2-cm thick walls of pre-WWIInaval armor plate, and is further shielded by a minimum of 1.2 m of specularhematite. The total overburden of shielding is equivalent to 31.7 m ofwater. Careful selection of building materials and a special air filteringsystem maintain a cleanroom environment with minimum contamination potential.Background improvements are noted relative to an earlier ground-levelcounting chamber with 30.5-cm-thick walls of pre-WWII naval armor plate.Performance appraisals of facility detectors include a large dual NaI(Tl)coincidence system, three smaller NaI(Tl) detectors, and HPGe well detecotr,and gas proportional and Geiger counters. Major electronics for the detectorsare located at a ground level control center to eliminate any associatedbackgrounds. Because an individual sample may be counted several days,uninterruptable power is used. An IBM PC/XT computer processes spectrafrom multi-channel analyzers using custom-developed software. 25 refs.,15 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
