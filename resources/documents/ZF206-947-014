(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FAA Tests Software for Airline Safety InspectionsandM;The people who analyze airline safety violations for the Federaln AviationAdministration are testing a software program that could help them detectpatterns in inspection data tha might have eluded them before.andM;Knowledge Network Systems Inc., Chantilly, Va., created the Oasis softwarepackage to run on top of NetWare 2.0, the network operating system softwaremade by Novell Inc.andP;  The FAA's Flight Standards Division will use thesoftware on its local area networks to improve the summary records it keepsand distributes.andM;The general-purpose software will be installed on Novell LANs in the FAA'sEastern regional office at Kennedy international Airport in New York and adistrict office at Washington-Dulles International Airport in Washington.andM;The regional office runs mostly dBase III applications on its 22-workstationLAN, with IBM XTs and some ATs.andP;  The workstations are linked to a singleNovell files server with a Motorola 68000 microprocessor and a four-portNovell asynchronous communications gateway running NetWare AnyWare.andM;Oasis will replace NetWare AnyWare in the software trial.andP;  The add-onsoftware is supposed to beef up Novell's network operating system, itsdevelopers said.andM;&quot;This really holds out the hope of automating our program management system,&quot;FAA Flight Standards Division manager Thomas C. Accardi said.andM;Works in the Wee HoursandM;The division office LAN will be set up to receive daily inspection data fromthe 14 district offices.andP;  Oasis running on the division LAN will sort theinformation in the wee hours of the morning and have record summaries readywhen the headquarters people turn on their desktop PCs the next day.andM;FAA managers and inspectors will use that information to show them whichairlines are having problems that require more attention.andM;The software has several features for improving work group productivity andnetwork security, Knowledge Network Systems president Terril J. Steichensaid.andM;With Oasis installed on top of NetWare, every execution is controlled andlogged automatically at each workstation, he said.andM;The Oasis software distributes network resources and oversight privilegesamong the network users &quot;as needed&quot; to do their tasks, Steichen said.andO;Additional features are keyboard locking for security and memory-residentsupport for real-time chats between users.andM;Users log on to Oasis under an encrypted name.andP;  User passwords also areencrypted, he said.andM;Menus can be set up in advance to lock out contractors' access to the networkafter a set date of six months, for example.andM;The software automatically manages software licenses by controlling thenumber of users who can access a particular software application at any giventime, he said.andM;Does Not Police UsersandM;As a work group productivity tool, Oasis lets users review documents.andP;  Italso structures work group activities but does not police users as some workgroup systems do, he said.andM;Most agency network users are people &quot;just trying to get a job done,&quot; andOasis supports that, said Glenn Pritchard, a customer support representativefor Knowledge Network Systems.andM;With Oasis software installed on the LAN, he said, users are spared theeffort of locating a word processing application, for example, then selectingand loading the work file, changing to the proper working directory andbacking up work files.andM;Oasis is written in an interpretive language that allows NetWare users tobypass batch file procedures that are &quot;too slow and too insecure,&quot; Steichensaid.andP;  The interpretive language is the company's proprietary scriptlanguage, Opal.andM;&quot;It's written mostly in C and some assembler,&quot; Steichen said.andP;  &quot;It's got someC, it's got some FORTRAN, it's got some Pascal in it,&quot; Pritchard said.andM;The software installation package, contained on eight floppies, has threeseparate modules for managing network productivity, network users andthird-party software applications.andM;Oasis can be installed in phases.andP;  Having Oasis on the network will notinterfere with non-Oasis users on the network,  Steichen said.andM;The company plans to begin a nationwide sales effort in March.andM;Contact Bob Bealle, Knowledge Network Systems vice president of marketing,tel.andP;  703-968-0378.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
