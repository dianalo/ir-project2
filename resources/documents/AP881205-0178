One resolution singled out Israel and ``certain Western states''for criticism because of their continued military, nuclear,intelligence and technological trade and collaboration with SouthAfrica.   The General Assembly passes similar anti-apartheid resolutionsevery year.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   The resolution condemning military collaboration with SouthAfrica passed 123-2, with 29 abstentions. Israel, which wascriticized by name, and the United States voted against it. MostWestern nations, including Australia and New Zealand, and Japanabstained.   U.S. delegate Harvey Nelson said the United States opposed theresolution because it explicitly criticized Israel ``for actionswhich many have committed, including some of those who protest mostloudly.''   Another resolution calling on Israel to end its collaborationwith South Africa, particularly its long-term contracts for militarysupplies, passed 106-23, with 26 abstentions.   Numerous Western nations opposed that resolution because itsingled out one nation for what they called unproductive criticism.Canada, the United States, and the 12 European Community nationstook that view.   The resolution calling for comprehensive and mandatory economicsanctions against South Africa passed 123-12, with 19 abstentions.Japan was mentioned in the text as South Africa's largest tradepartner.   Japanese Ambassador Hideo Kagami contended the resolution gavethe false impression that Japan has been increasing its trade withSouth Africa.   He said Japanese trade as measured in yen had declined every yearsince 1984. A rise in trade as measured in dollars merely reflectedthe fall of the dollar against the yen, he said.   That resolution called for the Security Council to make economicsanctions mandantory and appealed to Britain and the United Statesnot to continue using their veto power to block enforced sanctions.   The 12 opposition votes were from Western Europe, Canada, Japanand Israel.   A resolution expressing international solidarity with the``liberation struggle'' against South Africa passed 131-3, with 21abstentions by most of the Western allies. The United States,Britain and Portugal voted against the measure.   The resolution called for full support for the African NationalCongress, the black guerrilla group fighting the South Africangovernment; and affirmed the right to used armed struggle in pursuitof liberation.   Portugal's second-ranking diplomat, Jose Caetano da CostaPereira, said his country opposed apartheid but could not supportthe endorsement of armed struggle.   A resolution calling for voluntary international coordination andmonitoring of boycotts against South Africa passed 136-4, with 14abstentions by Western nations, Japan and Malawi.   West Germany, Portugal, Britain and the United States opposed theresolution, which calls for nations to adopt voluntary sanctionsagainst South Africa preventing trade in nuclear materials andtechnology, oil and petroleum, credit and loans, air transport andlinks, culture and sports, and military goods and services.   The current voluntary oil embargo against South Africa would bemade mandatory by the Security Council, under a resolution thatpassed 138-2, with 14 abstentions by Western Europe, Canada, Japan,Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.   Britain and the United States voted ``no,'' and have vetoedattempts in previous years to make the embargo mandatory by usingtheir veto in the Security Council.</TEXT></DOC>
