<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0734 </DOCNO><TEXT>The superposition method for recording neutron diffraction patterns bymeans of multidetector movable systems is described. Luminosity and resolutioncharacteristics of 'small' systems (with 10-16 detectors) and the annulardiffractometer DISK (with 224 detectors) are shown. Applications of thediffractometer DISK to structural research using microquantities of matter(of about 1 mg or less) are proposed and results of such experimentsare demonstrated.</TEXT></DOC>
