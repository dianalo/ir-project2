(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three former Iran hostages laid a wreathSaturday at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the eight U.S.servicemen who died in the abortive 1980 attempt to rescueAmericans being held captive in Tehran.   Taking part in the ceremony were former hostages Richard Queen,William Royer and retired Air Force Col. David Roeder.   ``It's a very humbling thing, for someone to volunteer to givehis life, ... to regain freedom for, as far as I know, people theydidn't know personally,'' Roeder said at the ceremony.   ``I felt very proud of this country, in the way that they didn'tabandon us,'' he said.   Royer called it a day of reflection.   ``My heart goes out to the families of the hostages still beingheld in Beirut, the anguish and uncertainty that they'reexperiencing, and to the families of the service personnel who werelost in the rescue attempt,'' Royer said.   The wreath-laying at the Iran Rescue Mission Plaque in thecemetery was followed by the playing of taps.   The tribute was sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarianorganization which promoted the yellow ribbon campaign during theIran hostage crisis and now seeks to assist the families ofAmericans being held in Lebanon.   Bruce Laingen, a board member of No Greater Love, said in astatement: ``As a former hostage in Iran, I fervently appeal tothose who hold hostage our eight countrymen and others in Beiruttoday, and to those who can influence them, to restore these men tofreedom and their families.   ``Their continued incarceration can serve no one's purpose andis a tragic offense to human rights,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
