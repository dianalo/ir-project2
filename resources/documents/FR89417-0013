Previously, the ozone seasonfor Texas had been designated as the entire year. The State of Texas coversa large geographical area and historical monitoring data indicates thatcertain areas in Texas are not subject to high O<T2>3</T2> concentrations during the winter months. Therefore, pursuantto 40 CFR 58.13(a)(3), by letter dated January 17, 1989, I made the finaldetermination that Air Quality Control Regions (AQCR) 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9,and 12 in Texas are exempted from the twelve month ozone monitoring seasonand are now subject to a March-October O<T2>3</T2> monitoring timeframe. The modified O<T2>3</T2> season will apply to 1988 O<T2>3</T2> monitoring data and future monitoring efforts unless otherwiserevised.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the documents relevant to this action areavailable for public inspection during normal business hours at the followinglocations:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Air Programs Branch(6T-AN), 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Texas Air Control Board, 6330 Highway 290 East, Austin, Texas 78723.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Rebecca Caldwell, Air ProgramsBranch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue,Dallas, Texas 75202, (214) 655-7214 or (FTS) 255-7214.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The State of Texas has an extensive monitoring program since the emissionsand meteorological conditions in parts of Texas are conducive to the productionof ozone. In addition to the monitors already in place, Texas is also conductingseasonal O<T2>3</T2> monitoring in counties that surround metropolitan areas in orderto determine the geographical extent of the high ozone concentrations.Given this need for an increase in the O<T2>3</T2> monitoring data base, EPA Region 6 and the State of Texas discussedthe possibility of reducing the monitoring timeframe in certain areas inorder to conserve resources. 40 CFR 58.13(a)(3) provides that the RegionalAdministrator may exempt periods or seasons from consecutive hourly averagesfor continuous SLAMS analyzers. EPA Region 6 technical staff reviewed the O<T2>3</T2> data from 1979 through 1987 to determine when the 0<T2>3</T2> exceedances have occurred in the past years. The results areas follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Region 1: No O<T2>3</T2> monitoring data </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 2: No O<T2>3</T2> monitoring data </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 3: June 16-October 12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 4: No O<T2>3</T2> monitoring data </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 5: April 16-October 15 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 6: May 24 (only exceedance) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 7: January 1-December 29 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 8: April 24-September 30 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 9: July 22-September 12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 10: January 4-December 18 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 11: January 27-November 16 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Region 12: March 1-October 8</ITAG>Based on the above data, I made the final determination on January 17,1989, that the Gulf Coast areas (AQCRs 4, 5, 7, 10) as well as the El Pasoarea (AQCR 11) will remain subject to a year-long O<T2>3</T2> season since O<T2>3</T2> exceedances have occurred in the winter months or are expectedto occur due to the climatological similarities of the Gulf Coast area.Additionally, I modified the remaining Regions' (AQCRs 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9,12) O<T2>3</T2> seasons to a 245 day time period of March-October since O<T2>3</T2> exceedances have not occurred or are not expected to occur outsidethis timeframe in these AQCRs. O<T2>3</T2> monitoring has not been conducted in AQCR 1, 2, and 4, however,we would expect the meteorology to be similiar to the AQCRs that surroundthese areas and have grouped them accordingly. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under Section 307 (b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 16, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements (See 307(b)(2)).<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 3, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
