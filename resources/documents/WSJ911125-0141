Jacques Attali, the controversial Frenchman who runs thenewly created European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, has done just that. And the future he sketchesout in this short volume is enough to make George Bushskittish about &quot;the vision thing&quot; for years to come.</LP><TEXT>   According to Mr. Attali, America is only slightly behindthe Soviet Union in the race toward irreversible collapse.Europe, meanwhile, enjoys radiant prospects as a new economicand cultural megapower stretching from Lisbon to Moscow, withplenty of high-speed rail connections in between. Asia alsois on the ascent, with the U.S. eventually nestling into aTokyo-dominated &quot;Pacific sphere&quot; as an offshore granary.   Mr. Attali's book came out in French two years ago. It hassince been translated into English and updated.   But having sifted winners from losers, Mr. Attali doesn'tpaint a pretty picture of the victors. They become privilegednomads, roaming the globe attached to cellular telephones,portable fax machines and wristband computers. They don'thave real addresses, and they work all the time because theycan't get away from all their high-tech paraphernalia --which he refers to as &quot;nomadic objects&quot; and &quot;artificiallimbs.&quot; The oceanside resorts these ornately homeless folkmight once have visited would have long since been reclaimedby the sea as a result of global warming. Meanwhile, theirpeace of mind is continually battered by an even sadder setof nomads -- the truly marginalized peoples owning littlemore than television sets that remind them how miserable lifein Africa (&quot;a lost continent&quot;) or Uzbekistan is compared withthe privileged centers in the north.   Blueprints of the future often lose their value asforecasts because they don't leave room for the X factors:the tyrants, heroes, puttering inventors or deadly virusesthat invariably arrive out of nowhere and change the courseof things. However, futurists can offer valuable views of thepresent.   Rightly or wrongly, many Europeans are reaching toward avision of unity that has possessed but eluded these diverse,jostling cultures for centuries. The possibility of avoluntarily unified Europe -- including some number oferstwhile enemies to the east -- could be an enormous sourceof growth for the world.   It may also never happen. Mr. Attali acknowledges the manyhurdles: the need for Western Europe to absorb and reform theeconomic wreckage in the East; the already manifested dangerof bloody nationalisms reasserting themselves; the scourge ofxenophobia and racism that greets many impoverishedimmigrants.   It is indicative of the optimism that still animates manyEuropean leaders that Mr. Attali seems certain that Europeanswill navigate this minefield successfully. &quot;One day, all ofEurope will be united, one way or the other, replete withContinental institutions,&quot; he states. Moreover, the ECU(European currency unit) could surpass the dollar and theyen, and &quot;the values of European civil society -- liberty anddemocracy -- could stretch across the entire planet.&quot; Thisreader all but expected Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; to boomforth from the pages.   But while Europeans are overcoming their difficulties,Americans are succumbing to theirs -- at least in the Attaliworld order. The U.S. may be the one surviving superpower,but it's not producing enough manufactured goods to financeits debts, and its streets are peopled by &quot;beggars, criminalsand drug addicts.&quot;   More darkly, Mr. Attali sees &quot;a profound cultural mutation-- the cult of immediate gratification, the lack ofinternationalism, the lack of global social solidarity -- allreflecting a country abandoning those values for which it isuniversally admired.&quot; The best thing going for the U.S., headds, is its linkage with Mexico and other Latin Americanstates.   While some of this doubtless will be dismissed as moreAmerican &quot;declinism&quot; -- and from a French socialist, at that-- Mr. Attali's view should give pause. Despite itsleadership in the Gulf War and Mideast peace talks, the U.S.isn't advancing a coherent vision of itself and its role inthe world -- at least not one that means much to many oftoday's Europeans.   Of course, Mr. Attali's view of America's future shouldn'tgive anyone much cause for smugness. If consumerism and freepolitical choice produced cultural and economic rot in theU.S., what can Poland or Mexico expect, now that they, likedozens of other states, have embraced these same approaches?   Mr. Attali's disturbing view of the world's futureultimately departs the realm of economics. He calls for a&quot;new sacred covenant . . . between man and nature so that theearth endures, so that the ephemeral gives way to theeternal, so that diversity resists homogeneity.&quot; But that'sanother big topic demanding another small book.   ---   Mr. Carrington is a reporter for The Wall Street JournalEurope in London.</TEXT></DOC>
