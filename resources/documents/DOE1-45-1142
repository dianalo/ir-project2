Ideally,a respirator should provide no breathing resistance and total protectionagainst NBC agents. In practice, though, target-protection-factor valuesare specified which are mainly based on threat scenarios, and are standardizedwithin NATO for both ground forces (1) and aircrew. Higher standardsof protection are required for aircrew because of the very small quantityof nerve agent that is required to cause myosis and incapacitate aircraftpilots (2). The accuracy of the evaluation of the protection affordedbecomes extremely important not only in the certification process ofany respirator considered for NBC defence but also in training the usersto obtain the best fit. The purpose of this paper is to review quantitative-fittest methods and their limitations concentrating primarily on sodiumchloride and corn oil aerosols and to provide guidelines that would helpstandardize these systems.</TEXT></DOC>
