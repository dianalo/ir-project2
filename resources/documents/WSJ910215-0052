The British, French, Germans and others are redoublingefforts to break into Japan, lured by growing demand andpotential opportunities resulting from cracks in the45-year-old military-industrial alliance between Washingtonand Tokyo. Although U.S. aircraft makers will certainlycontinue to dominate the Japanese market for years to come,the Europeans have scored several symbolically importantsales and alliances in recent months.</LP><TEXT>   The most significant link between Europe and Japan couldbe a tie between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. andMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., which is part ofwide-ranging talks started a year ago between the MitsubishiGroup and Daimler-Benz AG of Germany, which controls MBB.Also, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. recently became thefirst Japanese maker to work with Airbus Industrie, theEuropean consortium, to build commercial aircraft. AndBritish Aerospace PLC has made the first non-U.S. militaryaircraft sale to Japan.   &quot;The Europeans -- and others -- are aggressively goingafter the abundant Japanese aerospace market,&quot; notes a paperpublished this month by the American Aerospace Industry inJapan, an industry trade group. &quot;If the U.S. continues itstake-it-for-granted attitude about the Japanese market, wewill forfeit our commanding position here,&quot; it warns.   &quot;The U.S. is rightly cautious,&quot; says Sydney Gillibrand,chairman of British Aerospace's civil aircraft division andhead of the Society of British Aerospace Companies, anindustry trade group. &quot;Forget the traditional ties, let'shave some competition.&quot; Adds Henri Martre, president ofAerospatiale of France and head of the French AerospaceIndustries Association: &quot;As the Japanese industry develops,there will be more and more cooperation between us.&quot;   Messrs. Gillibrand and Martre are part of a high-poweredEuropean delegation visiting Japan this week for thecountry's first major international aerospace exhibition innearly a decade. Nearly twice as many European companies asAmericans are attending. While Boeing Co., the largest U.S.airplane maker, has a small booth with a few models on thefloor, the French aircraft makers have a half-dozen fullsizedhelicopters on display.   The stakes for the Japanese aircraft market are high. TheU.S. has a $2 billion annual aircraft surplus with Japan, oneof the few bright spots in manufacturing trade between thetwo countries. Japan is the largest export market forAmerican aircraft companies, who currently dwarf Europeansales in Japan by a ratio of nine to one. The battle willlikely intensify as American and European makers face toughtimes in their home markets from declining military spendingand dwindling civilian travel.   Japan's inability to make its own major aircraft -- a rarehole in its industrial base -- goes back to the years justafter World War II, when the U.S. restricted the industry.Japan's own prohibition against military exports makes itdifficult to find a world-wide market for its products. Thegovernment has officially abandoned, at least for now, dreamsof building an indigenous aerospace industry and instead isencouraging Japanese companies to find foreign partners.   The U.S. has traditionally been the favored partner. Butrecent U.S. government actions and restrictions may endangerthat, the U.S. industry trade group says. Some officials andanalysts argue that American companies tend to give awaytechnologies that could come back to haunt them in thefuture.   But the U.S. industry group says such attitudes, whichcame out during the drawn-out flap over the FSX fighter planetwo years ago, created ill-will that still lasts today. Inthe FSX case, the U.S. government insisted that Japanco-develop the plane and then refused to share keytechnology. U.S. industry officials add that they arecontinually hamstrung by policies that prevent them fromsharing software, while the Europeans have no suchconstraints.   During the FSX debate, U.S. companies warned that Americangovernment intransigence would push Japan closer to Europe.   British Aerospace's Mr. Gillibrand argues that &quot;we aremore open&quot; than the U.S. &quot;If Japan wishes to build aircraft,it will do so sooner or later, so it's best to make someagreements with them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
