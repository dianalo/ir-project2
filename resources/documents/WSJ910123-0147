Theseinclude whether the nuclear-winter theory is correct and thelikelihood that some type of nuclear exchange will occur.While these debates are interesting, I believe they obscureforward-looking issues for an environmentally correct,thinking person. A more relevant and interesting discussionwould involve to what extent nuclear winter should be viewedas a possible solution to the problems of global warming andthe greenhouse effect. Please pass this idea along to theappropriate theorists.   John J. Bethune</LP><TEXT>   Department of Economics   Bellarmine College   Louisville, Ky.   ---   Mr. Queenan's review generally revealed the critic to be amaster of flippancy. On the subject of women's colleges heis, however, rather in need of tutelage. Toward the end ofthe review, he complains about Messrs. Sagan and Turco'sapparently simplistic references to mythological figures.Such &quot;Mythology 101 name-dropping,&quot; we are told, &quot;rarely isused for anything other than getting dates with girls fromBryn Mawr.&quot;   I find it difficult to believe Mr. Queenan knows or hasever known any Bryn Mawr women. The only dates Bryn Mawrtyrsmight offer such psuedointellectual name-droppers would bethe days on which these cultural illiterates could attend aseminar in Greek and Roman religion.   Charlotte L. Stoudt   Bryn Mawr '87   Charlottesville, Va.   ---   Mr. Queenan's review is amusing and well written, exceptfor one small item:   He miscalls the National Hockey League's Lady Byng award,&quot;Lady Bing.&quot;   He quickly redeems himself, however, with the correct callon the liberalism of authors Sagan and Turco: Interference]   Jerry Nielson   Westfield, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
