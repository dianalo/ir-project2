In fact, executives and directors of the Norwalk, Conn.,manufacturer of surgical staples and instruments wereresponsible for three of the five largest sales reported tothe SEC last week.

He trimmedhis holdings by 200,000 shares, valued at the time at $23.9million.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. Surgical stock has been a highflier, climbing fromabout $45 a year ago to a record close of $131.75 last month,shortly before the company announced a 96% jump infourth-quarter net income.   Yesterday, however, the stock took a hit, sliding $8.75 inlate Big Board trading to end at $103. U.S. Surgical wasamong several health-care stocks that sold off asinstitutional investors took profits on growth stocks andherded into cyclicals.   Wall Street analysts are generally bullish on U.S.Surgical, citing its role as the dominant provider ofdisposable surgical equipment for common procedures such asgall bladder operations. But short sellers -- investorsbetting that the stock's price will fall -- have read a lotinto the insider selling at the company.   Short interest in the stock was 1.5 million shares in themonth ended Jan. 15, according to the New York StockExchange. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, bettingthey can replace them later at a lower price. Short interestis the number of shares borrowed.   Insider selling, however, is common at U.S. Surgical. Forexample, a cluster of 13 insiders trimmed their holdings inthe summer of 1990, when the stock was at about $34 a share,sales that in retrospect look &quot;not too smart,&quot; said Mr.Lustman, who was also one of the sellers back then.   This time around, Mr. Lustman's shares fetched an averageprice of $119.64 each, according to SEC filings. He hadobtained many of those shares through options exercisesimmediately prior to the sales at $12.25 a share, SEC filingsshow. He still holds 120,000 U.S. Surgical shares outrightand options to purchase more.   The stock sale &quot;was part of my estate planning, for taxpurposes and part of a selling program I've performed&quot; overthe last several years, says Mr. Lustman. He added that hewas &quot;very bullish&quot; about the market for &quot;minimally invasivesurgery and our No. 1 position in it.&quot;   Glenn Reicin, analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says whetheran investor should buy U.S. Surgical stock now &quot;depends onyour time horizon.&quot; While the stock may or may not be higherthan its current level in three months, &quot;it will be in twoyears,&quot; he predicts. &quot;There's a revolution going on&quot; in thesurgical supplies industry &quot;and they're the only way to playit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
