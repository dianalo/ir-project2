Galbreath has hunted sheep inMongolia and bongo antelopes in Africa. But as the nation'sthird-largest developer, Mr. Galbreath is now trying to savehis company's hide.   The son of the legendary real estate tycoon John W.Galbreath, he inherited a family-owned business that madefortunes building and leasing downtown skyscrapers. His latefather weathered boom-and-bust real estate cycles, but theyounger Galbreath has been hurt in the current downturn.</LP><TEXT>   Now Banc One Corp. and other creditors have sued DanGalbreath and his company for defaulting on real estatedevelopment loans totaling $45 million. He also just missed adeadline to secure financing for a huge Cincinnatidevelopment, and is likely to lose the contract.   Mr. Galbreath has laid off 25% of his headquarter's staffand hired a workout loan specialist to restructure companydebts. Facing a cash crunch, he has raised $13.6 million inthe last two years by selling interests in businessproperties, and he has sold the company jet and pared backentertainment expenses.   The real estate market &quot;hasn't been like this since theDepression,&quot; Mr. Galbreath says. &quot;I didn't cause it, but I'mcaught in it.&quot;   The woes of Galbreath Co. offer a case study of how animmensely prosperous family business can lose its way when itloses its founder. The younger Mr. Galbreath, a kindly,unpretentious sort who once owned the Pittsburgh Pirates,emerges as an heir who has had trouble following in thefootsteps of his father, who died three years ago.   Mr. Galbreath, 62 years old, is also under siege at home.He is fighting two costly lawsuits, including a protracteddivorce case, from family members who want a piece of theGalbreath fortune.   The outcome of the divorce case, in particular, could havea big impact on Mr. Galbreath's business interests, as hispersonal assets overlap with company assets. His estrangedwife's lawyer has tried to thwart his efforts to sell offassets until a divorce settlement is reached.   &quot;It's like he's got his back to the wall,&quot; says Banc OneChairman John B. McCoy, a longtime friend of Mr. Galbreath.&quot;The worst thing that could happen is that he'd loseeverything, but that's one chance in 50.&quot;   The only son of John Galbreath, Dan is the sole owner ofGalbreath Co., a Columbus, Ohio, concern whose projectsstretch from the U.S. to Hong Kong. He is also 66% owner of areal estate company that bears his name in New York.   Forbes Magazine estimates Mr. Galbreath's net worth at$340 million. The executive calls that a &quot;grossexaggeration,&quot; but won't provide any figures. His trophiesinclude the famous 4,400-acre Darby Dan Farm outside ofColumbus, where buffalo roam a wildlife preserve and horsestables have produced Kentucky Derby winners.   Although big-name developers such as Donald Trump havebeen laid low by the collapsing real estate market, Mr.Galbreath's reversal of fortune has shocked longtime businessassociates. That is because a hallmark of the late Mr.Galbreath was his shrewd ability to minimize risk.   During the Depression, he made a lot of money buyinghouses at bargain prices and reselling them. He later erectedsignature buildings for corporations such as U.S. Steel andOwens-Illinois, in which he assumed no equity in the buildingbut just took a big fee. He expanded his fee-based operationsby moving into the leasing and consulting business. Aconsummate showman, Mr. Galbreath once signed his name to thefront of 100 uncirculated dollar bills and passed them out toemployees. (He was celebrating his birthday.)   John Galbreath was active in the business until he diedthree years ago, at age 90. By all accounts, father and sonwere close, consulting on everything from horse breedingschedules to real estate developments. But Dan Galbreathconcedes it was difficult to escape his father's shadow.   &quot;We were kind of inseparable,&quot; he says. &quot;There were timeswhen it was difficult to measure my contributions, but I alsolearned a great deal from him.&quot;   The father and son also had very different styles. DanGalbreath is more approachable than his iron-fisted fatherand relies more on consensus. Nor is the younger Mr.Galbreath as single-minded as his father: Friends joke abouthis obsession with killing the bongo antelope.   Since Dan Galbreath took charge, the company has gotteninvolved in projects in what became heavily overbuilt areas.In West Palm Beach, Fla., the company and three localdevelopers built a $52 million, 25-floor marble-and-glasscommercial building, called the Esperante, with a three-storyatrium and eight condominiums at the top. The developers tooka small equity stake and borrowed heavily.   But now the building has a 75% occupancy rate and the softmarket has driven down rental rates. Galbreath Co. and theother owners have defaulted on a $2.6 million note that BancOne holds. The loans are being renegotiated.   Mr. Galbreath also faces other suits from Banc One andWestinghouse Credit Corp. relating to a West Palm Beachproject called Centrepark, a proposed 11-building office,hotel and retail park. Only one building has been built, andMr. Galbreath has defaulted on a $14.3 million Banc One loanand a $25 million loan from Westinghouse.   The company is also in trouble in Indianapolis, where ithas fallen behind in interest payments on loans for a48-story, $200 million Banc One tower complex that is littlemore than half leased.   Mr. Galbreath says his father would have made the samemistakes he made, given that realtors have been just aboutgiving away office space. &quot;That was the real estate industryof the 1980s,&quot; he contends. &quot;We had to do the deals without100% occupancy.&quot;   Meanwhile, family warfare has cost Mr. Galbreath millionsof dollars in legal fees. He has spent nine years trying tonegotiate a divorce settlement with his wife. A trial isscheduled for next month.   Mr. Galbreath describes the divorce proceedings as&quot;emotionally disturbing&quot; and says he is concerned about theimpact of the settlement on his company.   Another suit involves his late stepmother, DorothyFirestone Galbreath. Two grandchildren from her firstmarriage -- to tire and rubber magnate Russell A. Firestone-- have charged Dan Galbreath and other family members oflooting Mrs. Firestone's estate. (Mr. Galbreath won the suitlast year, but the verdict has been appealed.)   Family observers have their eye on Mr. Galbreath's33-year-old daughter, Lizanne, who is playing a moreprominent role in the New York office and is considered thelikely successor to her father. A graduate of Pennsylvania'sWharton School, she has increased the office's leasing andmanagement role and brought in new managers. Ms. Galbreath,who gave birth to her second son last week, couldn't bereached for comment. Associates say she reminds them more ofher grandfather than her father. And her father notes: &quot;She'sa sharp young lady.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
