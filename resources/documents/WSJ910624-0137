The loans would be provided only to nonexecutive employeeswho own stock outside of the company's employee stockownership and pension plans. The company said it is alsoexploring ways to enable trustees of those plans to exercisethe rights on behalf of the employees without requiringemployees to put up any cash. &quot;We are exploring thefeasibility of enabling the plans to exercise all of theirrights,&quot; a spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   There are approximately two million common shares held inthe employee stock ownership and pension plans; exercisingthe rights that would be conferred for those shares wouldrequire the trustees to come up with at least $125 million.   The company said it has no figures on how many shares areowned by nonexecutive employees outside of the plans. The$63,000 cap is based on assumed ownership of 1,000 shares ofstock, which would confer 600 rights. The loans would be atmarket interest rates, the company said.   As previously reported, the price of the common shares inthe rights offering will vary depending on how many holdersexercise the rights; if 100% exercise them, the price will be$105 a share; if only 60% exercise, the shares will sell for$63. Approximately 34.4 million shares will be issued underthe plan.   Time Warner said the plan is designed to help thoseemployees who can't get access to credit markets or take onadditional debt to exercise their rights. Top executiveswon't be covered by the loan plan. Top management, includingco-Chief Executives Steven J. Ross and N.J. Nicholas Jr. andChief Operating Officer Gerald Levin have all said they wouldexercise all of their rights for more than 250,000 sharesthey collectively own; they will have to borrow fundsindependently if necessary.   As previously reported, Time Warner will ask the board toapprove a plan to adjust some 15.4 million options to buycommon stock held by management and other employees.According to the rights offering filed with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, the adjustment will be calculated ona formula identical to one being used to adjust theconversion rates of two classes of preferred stock.   At the time of the offering, Time Warner used an assumedmarket price of $117.125 a share to calculate the adjustmentof the options. However, Time Warner stock plunged after theannouncement and has continued to drift generally lower. Itclosed Friday at $91.75, up $1.375, in New York StockExchange composite trading. At that price, the optionadjustment would be considerably less favorable thanoriginally contemplated, Time Warner executives noted, or anadjustment of about 1 1/2% under the plan as laid out in therights offering.</TEXT></DOC>
