Vargo (&quot;Private Enterprise in Poland,&quot; Feb. 3) in response to your editorial-page article &quot;East Europe Discovered Glasnost First&quot; (Jan. 8). Prof. Vargo obviously listened only to the &quot;official&quot; party line and like so many Westerners, especially from America, fell prey to seeing only the surface of an incredibly complex economy. Having personal experience with and close scrutiny of the real system in Poland through visits, relatives and friends there, I can only advise Prof. Vargo that the black market in Poland operates like capitalism in its purest form -- totally unregulated and free from the constraints in so-called free economies. In such a unique system, entrepreneurship abounds within every Polish citizen both in spirit and in action. Prof. Vargo well might advise his graduate students to study it as the ideal economic institution.    Danuta A. Solecka Urbikas   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
