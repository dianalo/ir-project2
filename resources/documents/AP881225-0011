(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bitter, five-month-old strike at asawmill has traumatized a logging town's 1,200 residents, splittingapart families, friends and union members who find themselves onopposite sides of a picket line.   Divisions within the town 55 miles northeast of Seattle have rundeep since 177 Summit Timber Co. mill workers went on strike Aug. 1after a three-year contract expired and the town's largest employerhired replacement workers.   Twenty-three union members also returned to work, while 90 whoonce were paid as much as $13 an hour remain on the picket line at$60 a week. Others have left to find other jobs.   Friendships in the small town are now measured against which sideof the picket line people are on.   ``Oh no. Oh no. He's one of them!'' said Gary Ensley, a strikingworker, as he watched a pickup truck drive into the Summit plant.``He's one of those who went back. His bills caught up with him, andhe started losing things, so he went back. ... I don't like himanymore.''   Nancy Stull, 43, a 13-year Summit employee, and her husband, a22-year mill veteran, walked out together with her two brothers.   One brother found another job and, with his first paycheck,bought her $250 worth of groceries, she said. The other, nowreferred to as her ``ex-brother,'' crossed the picket line about sixweeks into the walkout.   When she and her family drive to her parents' home for atraditional Christmas dinner, she said, ``if my ex-brother is there,we won't stay. We will just turn around and go home and have our owndinner.''   No talks have been scheduled since the last bargaining sessionbetween Summit and Lumber Production and Industrial Workers Union,Local 2860, ended Sept. 15.   Strikers say they helped the second-generation, family ownedbusiness through tough times, accepting a 25 percent pay cut in 1982and another cut in 1984. In the latest contract, according to unionofficials, the company wanted to retain a 20 percent pay cut itinstituted in 1986.   Lloyd Johnson, a union business agent, said the economic issuescould have been worked out, but the strike was called over a companydemand that union membership no longer be mandatory.   Terry Mullane, Summit personnel manager, said the union struckafter giving the company a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.   ``The strike is sad. It didn't have to happen,'' Mullane said.``We were forced to take an action for survival purposes.''   While the company hired replacements two weeks after the strikestarted, union members around the state have rallied to support thestriking workers.   All the striking families have been ``adopted'' by otherSnohomish County union members, who have provided food and gifts forthe children. Thousands of others around the state also have sentmoney, food and toys.   Linda Morgan said she and her husband, Charles, a seven-yearSummit employee, were given a 20-pound turkey, 10 pounds ofhamburger, about $150 worth of groceries and several presents fortheir 6-year-old daughter, Katie.   ``We have always had extra and been able to give to others. Iguess we have learned to receive, because we sure received lastSaturday,'' she said.   She said her husband found work at a mill in Alaska, but shecalled him home after a month.   ``I'd rather starve than live like that. It wasn't fair to her(Katie),'' she said. ``Every time her father would call, she wouldget on the phone and say, `When are you coming home, dad?'''</TEXT></DOC>
