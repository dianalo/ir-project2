Gritty, gray ash smothers the base's once-verdant groundsunder drifts as much as a meter deep. Collapsed warehousesand abandoned homes appear ghostly through the swirling dust.</LP><TEXT>   In a canyon about 200 yards from the perimeter of thebase, a still-hot tongue of volcanic debris nearly half akilometer wide and four meters deep fills a channel where ariver once ran. On the horizon, a dark mushroom cloud bloomsover six miles into the sky, is swept away by the wind, andis replaced with another.   &quot;A lot of people rely on Clark {for jobs} -- not onlypeople from here but from the {nearby} provinces,&quot; Mr. Aysonsays. &quot;I don't think the base will close, but if it does, Idon't know what we will do.&quot;   For Mr. Ayson and the tens of thousands of other Filipinoswho made their living directly or indirectly from the airbase, the impact of the volcanic eruptions that began earlylast month could be dire. Once the largest U.S. air baseoverseas, Clark has been transformed into a ghost town, itstwo runways rendered useless by the highly corrosive ash andthe threat of continued eruptions.   Sharp reductions in U.S. military personnel and dependentsat Clark and Subic Bay Naval Station, both within 25 miles ofthe volcano's new crater, are expected to take a heavy tollon central Luzon island. U.S. officials say the basespreviously pumped as much as $1 billion annually into thePhilippine economy.   Experts are rushing to assess damage and future volcanicthreats to the bases before U.S. special negotiator RichardArmitage arrives in Manila in mid-July to resume negotiationson a new bases treaty. Costs include the repair of hundredsof collapsed buildings, replacement of damaged equipment andremoval of millions of tons of sandy ash.   Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus has said he isconfident the U.S. will want to retain both bases. &quot;I visitedClark,&quot; he said last week. &quot;It will need a lot of scraping. Alot of roofs will need to be mended. I do not see that it hasbeen rendered totally useless.&quot;   U.S. officials in the Philippines have also asserted thatthey remain interested in reaching an agreement on bothbases. Rear Adm. Thomas Mercer, commander of U.S. forces inthe Philippines, said recently that his mission was to putClark and Subic back &quot;exactly as&quot; they were.   In Washington, however, at least some officials apparentlybelieve the U.S. assurances emanating from Manila have gonetoo far. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said, inresponse to reports from the Philippines, that &quot;Adm. Mercer'sstatement notwithstanding, we have not made any decision onwhether to keep Clark and Subic going at their pre-volcanolevels.&quot;   Privately, some U.S. officials say that Washington merelyseeks to keep its options open until damage from the volcanocan be assessed. Assurances of U.S. interest are necessary,they say, to prevent an anti-bases faction in the Philippinegovernment from using the eruption to push for a U.S.pullout.   While assessments of current damage continue, the moredifficult calculation is the threat of future eruptions.Subic received heavier ash falls and sustained more seriousdamage, but only Clark is threatened by pyroclastic flows,deadly avalanches of superheated gas, sand and rocks thathurl down the slopes at speeds of as much as 100 miles anhour.   &quot;We can't be assured that there won't be more majoreruptive activity,&quot; says Ed Wolfe, chief scientist at theCascades Volcano Observatory, established in Vancouver,Wash., after the 1980 explosion of Mount St. Helens. &quot;Ifthere is, Clark will be subject to the same sorts of threatsthat it was in June.&quot;   One of about a dozen U.S. scientists who helped thePhilippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology predictthe June eruption that forced the temporary evacuation ofClark, Mr. Wolfe said that even if the volcano doesn't blowagain, it will continue spewing hot ash for several months,and possibly for years.   Ash emissions are a serious hazard to aircraft in flight,particularly jets. On the ground, the powdery sand is amaintenance nightmare that shorts electrical lines, jamsgenerators and corrodes machinery.   During the June to October monsoon, Clark is downwind fromthe ash emissions. Subic, on the other hand, is separatedfrom the volcano by a low mountain range and was only heavilycoated with ash because the main eruption coincided with atyphoon that altered the prevailing winds.   Both bases, and their adjoining cities, face serious floodrisks because streams and drains have been clogged withvolcanic sand. However, the danger is greater in AngelesCity, adjacent to Clark, where fast-moving slushes of waterand volcanic debris known as lahars are expected with thefirst heavy rains.   &quot;All the solid material is up there in great abundance;all we need is the triggering action,&quot; says Kelvin Rodolfo, aPhilippine-born U.S. geologist who heads the Pinatubo LaharHazard Task Force.   Massive lahars also are anticipated in a string of townsalong narrow river valleys north of Subic, but the navy baseand the adjacent city of Olongapo don't face a serious laharthreat, Mr. Rodolfo says.   Damage from ash fall and earthquakes at Subic and Olongapohas nonetheless been severe. Fifty-five people were killed byeruption fallout in Olongapo, including several who died whenthe 200-bed city hospital collapsed beneath ash.   On the naval base itself, a hail of sand smashed more than200 structures, including dozens of warehouses and workshopsvital to the base's primary mission of repairing andresupplying U.S. Navy vessels. The volcanic fallout alsoshredded 37,000 acres of triple-canopy jungle, the last largestand of virgin forest in Luzon.   Protected from the illegal logging that has deforestedmost of the rest of the island, the Subic jungle provided thebase with a vital watershed and a unique venue forjungle-survival courses taught by aboriginal Aetas, a Negritopeople descended from some of the earliest inhabitants of thePhilippine archipelago.   The jungle is now a wasteland of smashed trees and brokenash-coated limbs, its once-teeming wildlife population eitherscattered or destroyed. Monkeys that survived the eruptionhave left the jungle to scavenge for garbage in other partsof the base.</TEXT></DOC>
