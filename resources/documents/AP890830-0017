The FDA, he said, ``has been lethargic in responding'' to itslegal obligation, especially since the government has known aboutthe danger for more than seven years.   FDA spokesman Don McLearn declined to comment on the ruling.   A revised FDA proposal issued in June would require tampon makersto prominently display one of six new standardized terms forabsorbency ranging from low to highest.   Under the proposal, tampon boxes would have to carry labelsadvising women to select the lowest absorbency needed to minimizerisk of toxic shock syndrome.   Toxic shock syndrome, or TSS, is a rare but sometimes fatalcondition associated with tampon use.   ``Women are unknowingly subjecting themselves to toxic shocksyndrome simply because (government officials) drag their feet in... standardizing tampon absorbency labels,'' Parker's opinion said.   The opinion came in a lawsuit filed a year ago by Public CitizenHealth Research Group, a non-profit organization, to force the FDAto issue tampon-labeling regulations.   Regulations have required a warning about TSS since 1982 butallow it to appear on a package insert.   The FDA has tried since 1981 to have manufacturers label tamponswith a standardized absorbency rating. The agency triedunsuccessfully to get tampon makers to voluntarily standardizelabeling, but began regulatory efforts in 1984.   Parker said the FDA's reasons for delay are ``lame at best andwholly irresponsible at worst.''</TEXT></DOC>
