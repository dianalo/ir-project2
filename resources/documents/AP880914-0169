(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man claiming he wanted to promote peacein Lebanon held 11 people at gunpoint at a military recruitingcenter Wednesday before releasing them unharmed and surrendering.   The gunman, identified as Samuel Eloud, 20, of suburban HenricoCounty, was being held at county police headquarters on 11 countsof abduction and 11 counts of use of a firearm in commission of afelony, authorities said.   Police Sgt. Joe Sands said Eloud described himself to policeduring telephone negotiations as being of Lebanese descent and saidhe had two armed companions.   The gunman began releasing his captives after two local radiostations broadcast a statement, but his goal was not immediatelyclear and he made no specific threats, said Sands.   Slight and wearing a yellow T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, Eloudwalked out of the center about 10 minutes after his last hostage,placed an AK-47 and what looked like ammunition clips on theground, then went back inside and emerged with a pistol, which healso laid on the ground.   He placed his hands on top of his head as directed by policeofficers, who handcuffed him and led him away.   The gunman seized the U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Center about9:15 a.m, taking hostage nine military personnel and two civilians.   A Marine recruiter reporting for work about 9:30 a.m. spottedthe gunman through the front window and went to an adjacent storeto call police, said police Lt. C.M. Schesventer. The gunman alsotelephoned police and remained in contact with a negotiator for thenext 4{ hours.   He released the first hostages, a female civilian and a highschool senior enlisting in the service, about 12:15 p.m. andgradually sent out the rest before surrendering about 1:50 p.m.   There were no injuries and no shots were fired, Schesventersaid. Authorities declined to give the hostages' names.   The recruiting station is in a strip shopping center on aheavily developed commercial street running into suburban HenricoCounty from Richmond. Authorities evacuated the stores and clearedthe parking lot as about 30 police vehicles cordoned off the area.Flak-jacketed police carrying automatic weapons and shotguns tookup positions in the lot and on nearby rooftops.   Richmond stations WRNL-AM and WRXL-FM went along with a HenricoCounty request to air a brief statement. It was read two timesabout noon, when authorities still believed the gunman hadaccomplices.   ``There is a hostage situation at Tuckernuck Square ShoppingCenter,'' the statement said. ``There have been no injuries.Negotiations are proceeding. The hostage-takers have so far beencooperative. They're holding an undetermined number of people. Thehostage-takers' goal is peace in Lebanon.''   Lebanon has been racked by sectarian fighting since 1975.   In Washington, D.C., the American Arab Anti-discriminationCommittee issued a statement condemning the action, which it calleda ``senseless act of terrorism.''   ``We fervently hope that this isolated instance of violence willnot fan the flames of anti-Arab sentiment in the United States,''said the statement from committee President Abdeen Jabara.   ``Terrorism never has been and never will be an acceptablesolution to the very real anguish and suffering of the Lebanesepeople.''</TEXT></DOC>
