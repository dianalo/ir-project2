The legislation authorizes the sale of as much as $4 billion in government-backed bonds to prop up the Federal Land Bank of Jackson, Miss., and several other shaky banks, and creates a secondary market for farm mortgages and rural housing loans. The package cleared the House on a 365-18 vote Friday and the Senate, 85-2, Saturday, ensuring that its chief sponsors, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Rep. Kika de la Garza (D., Texas) have more than enough support to override a presidential veto.    But the possibility of a veto now seems unlikely. Lawmakers revised the legislation somewhat last week to mollify the White House, after administration officials objected to the so-called Farmer Mac secondary market and a few other provisions. &quot;I've heard nothing negative on the final package,&quot; said Rep. de la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. &quot;I think we met all their concerns.&quot;    The rescue plan, which surpasses in size previous bailouts of New York City, Chrysler Corp. and Lockheed Corp., marks the third attempt by Congress in three years to bolster the troubled farm credit system. Under a 1985 law, strong system banks were required to share funds with weaker ones. Some strong banks, however, challenged the requirement in court, limiting its effectiveness. Last year, Congress authorized weak banks to stretch out the time they could take to write off bad loans.    Neither measure was enough, however, as the farm depression and thousands of loan defaults continued to sap the system's financial strength. Losses have totaled $4.8 billion since 1985 and, despite signs of improvement in the farm economy, system officials have said that several banks are in danger of collapsing. The Jackson bank, with more than $2 billion in assets, expects to run out of capital by the end of this month.    &quot;Without this legislation, we face the possibility of financial disaster in the Farm Belt,&quot; Sen. Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told his colleagues before the Saturday vote.    The bill provides for an assistance board to oversee the use of proceeds from the bond sales. The Treasury would pay all the interest on the 15-year bonds for the first five years, split the interest costs with the system for the second five years, and the system would pay all the interest for the final five years. But once the system regained its health, it would reimburse the Treasury entirely.    The Farmer Mac provisions allow commercial banks, thrifts and insurance companies, as well as system banks, to sell as securities packages of farm mortgages and rural housing loans from communities with fewer than 2,500 people. These &quot;securitized&quot; packages will carry a 90% guarantee from a newly created Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., which itself will have a $1.5 billion line of credit with the Treasury.    The package also requires the system's 12 federal land banks, 12 federal intermediate credit banks and 13 banks for cooperatives to vote on merging within six months of the bill's enactment. To further reduce overhead, the system's 12 districts are to vote on consolidating into six within 18 months.    In case of a bank failure, the bill guarantees the value of the stock owned by farmer-borrowers who buy shares in system banks, instead of paying lending fees. It also strengthens borrowers' rights and requires lenders in the system to restructure overdue loans if restructuring would be less expensive to the system than foreclosure. </TEXT></DOC>
