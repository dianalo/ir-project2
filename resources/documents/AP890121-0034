(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A transient grabbed a policeman's gun,shot him to death and mortally wounded another officer before policekilled the man in a 30-second fusillade as a terrified studenttelevision crew recorded the violence.   The homeless man, identified as Dale Randy Connors, 35, was beingquestioned by Officer Gene Simpson, 45, in front of a downtowndoughnut shop when a scuffle broke out around noon Friday, policeand witnesses said.   Among the estimated 30 witnesses were Santa Clara Universitystudents making a documentary on the homeless. As the videotaperolled, Connors grabbed Simpson's pistol, chased the 19-year policeveteran and opened fire, wounding him and then fatally shooting himin the head, police and witnesses said.   ``He began pursuing the officer. The officer hit the ground. He(the transient) cold-bloodedly pursued him,'' said Will Douglas ofLos Angeles, a witness who was driving through the area. ``I saw theofficer disappear behind a truck. I saw the man lower his gun andshoot.''   The film crew and other bystanders ducked behind cars and intonearby businesses as shots rang out and a second patrolman, GordonSilva, was mortally wounded.   The students' videotape, though jumpy and incomplete, shows thetransient firing at the wounded officers. A moment later, he isshown lying in the street.   On the tape, a cacophony of voices can be heard as members of thefilm crew and their subjects try to figure out what happened.Gradually, as the sound of sirens grows louder in the background,they identify the gunman as a figure wearing a brown coat _ Connors.   Although the tape is of poor quality, the man in the brown coatcan be seen firing a final shot, then jogging across the street withthe pistol in his hand. As the frequency of gunfire increases, ahysterical woman shouts, ``Stay down! Stay down!''   The next video image is of the gunman's motionless body in thestreet.   Police later said Simpson was dead at the scene.   Silva underwent three hours of surgery at San Jose Medical Centerand received 50 units of blood, but doctors were unable to save the17-year police veteran, authorities said.   Among the witnesses was Mike Fletcher, another homeless man whoknew Connors only as Randy. He said said he thought something waswrong with Connors when he saw him earlier in the day.   ``I talked to him earlier this morning and he was in a trance, ina daze,'' said Fletcher.   Simpson apparently approached Connors initially because thetransient had been acting oddly. Witnesses said the homeless man hadbeen waving his arms as if he were trying to direct traffic.   Another witness, Vince Ojeda, said Connors ``just grabbed thecop's gun and the cop took off. The guy started shooting. ... Hefired about three (shots) or more. The cop took off and then aminute later, there were a lot of cops _ a ton of cops wereshooting.''   Other shootings of police involving transients have occurredacross the nation in recent years.   In one of the more highly publicized cases, a white Dallas policeofficer was killed last year by a mentally ill, black transient whograbbed his gun and shot him while a crowd watched and somewitnesses allegedly shouted, ``Shoot, shoot!'' The transient waslater killed by police.</TEXT></DOC>
