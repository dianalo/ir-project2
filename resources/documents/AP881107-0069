The station said it did not have a breakdown on how many of the600 were dead and how many injured in Sunday's quake.   The radio report could not immediately be confirmedindependently. The State Seismology Bureau in Beijing, which earlierreported 18 dead and 54 injured, said it had no new information.   The highest previous count was from the official Xinhua NewsAgency, which reported at least 37 deaths and said more than 100people were injured. Telephone service was cut off to the affectedregion, in Yunnan province near the Burmese border.   The quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale, and was followedovernight and early today by 34 aftershocks, the strongest measuring7.2 on the Richter scale.   Roads to the affected area were impassable and Yunnan authoritiesordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies.Yunnan Gov. He Zhiqiang flew to the scene to direct rescue work.   Xinhua said most houses were destroyed in Lancang and Mengliancounties, which were at the epicenter of the quake. The populationof the counties was not immediately available, but officials saidthe area is sparsely inhabited.   Buildings also were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties, Xinhuasaid. Most homes in that part of China are simple mud and woodstructures.   Crews were working to repair roads, and radio contact wasestablished, Xinhua said.   Lancang is home to the Lahu minority group, and the Va minoritygroup also lives in the region.   There are about 300,000 Lahu people, most of them in Yunnanprovince. They are related to Tibetans and Burmans and practiceBuddhism. The Va people number about 260,000, speak a language ofthe Mon-Khmer branch and are Buddhists. Both groups are primarilyfarmers.   At about the same time as the first quake in China, a lesspowerful temblor was reported in northern Thailand near the Burmeseborder. The quake caused minor damage to buildings and madehigh-rise buildings sway in Bangkok, hundreds of miles to the south.   In the ``Skylounge'' restaurant on the top floor of the 43-storyBaiyoke Tower, Bangkok's tallest building, hundreds of panickedpatrons fled without paying their bills.   The quake in China was also felt in Yunnan's capital, Kunming,240 miles northeast of Lancang, a city of 1.5 million residents. Theseismology bureau said there was no damage there.   A quake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale hit the Lancang regionOct. 15, but there were no reports of casualties.   The Yunnan quake was the second in China during the weekend.   On Saturday, a quake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale shooknorthern Tibet and Qinghai province in far western China. Qinghaiseismology officials said the epicenter was in an uninhabited areaof the Tanggula Mountains and there were no reports of casualties.   Earthquakes occur frequently both in the Tanggula Mountains andthe series of mountain chains that stretch along China's southernborder. However, quakes measuring 7 or more on the Richter scale arerare.   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by anearthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on aseismograph. A quake measuring 7 is capable of causing heavy damagein a populated area, while one measuring 8 is 10 times as strong andcapable of tremendous damage.   China is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world,and seismology officials predicted in 1985 that quake activity wouldincrease through the end of the century.   The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985, when a temblormeasuring 7.4 on the Richter scale killed 71 people and injured 125in the far western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.   China's worst earthquake in modern times was the temblormeasuring 7.8 that leveled the northeastern industrial city ofTangshan on July 28, 1976, killing at 242,000 people by officialcount.   The world's most deadly earthquake ever was a Jan. 24, 1556temblor in north-central China that killed 830,000 people.</TEXT></DOC>
