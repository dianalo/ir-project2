In the past, the Forest Service has relied on Bureauof Land Management procedures and regulations. However, the Federal courtshave ruled that the Forest Service must promulgate its own procedures andregulations. Additionally, the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing ReformAct of 1987 expanded the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture in themanagement of oil and gas resources on National Forest System lands anddirected the Secretary to issue rules on bonding and reclamation standards.The intent of these rules is to satisfy both judicial direction and thenew statute; to coordinate Forest Service oil and gas resource managementprocedures with those of the Bureau of Land Management, and to promotecooperation among the Agency, the oil and gas industry, and other publicsinterested in the management of oil and gas resources of the National ForestSystem lands.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received in writing by March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send written comments to F.

Inthe past, the Forese Service has relied upon interagency agreements withthe Bureau of Land Management to guide Forest Service review of proposedoil and gas leasing and review of proposed surface disturbances causedby oil and gas operations on those leases. However, the Forest Servicehas received judicial direction to promulgate regulations governing oiland gas leasing on National Forest System lands. The recently enacted FederalOnshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 (30 U.S.C. 226 et seq.)also requires the Forest Service to promulgate rules both to implementthe new authority that the statute gave to the Secretary of Agricultureover oil and gas leasing and operations and to fufill the statute's mandatethat the Secretary of Agriculture develop rules which ensure that adequatebonds are posted for reclamation of surface disturbing operations on alease.The Forest Service seeks to facilitate the orderly and environmentallysound development of Federal leasable oil and gas resources of the NationalForest System in cooperation with the oil and gas industry and other interestedpublics. These regulations are designed to achieve that end.The Secretary of Agriculture is reserving the authority at lease issuanceto deny all operations on a leasehold in those circumstances where furtherenvironmental analyses beyond those done at the suitability determinationindicate such preclusion is appropriate. This reservation of authorityis required under such cases as <T3>Conner </T3>v. <T3>Burford, </T3>848 F.2d 1441 (9th Cir. 1988) and <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Peterson, </T3>717 F.2d 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1983) to allow the agency theflexibility to engage in staged NEPA compliance. To the extent practicablegiven the changes in the Forest Service's authority over oil and gas leasingand operations made by the Leasing Reform Act, the proposed rule maintainsthe existing procedures by which the Bureau of Land Management and theForest Service have been jointly responding to leasing and operating proposals.The primary reason for following the existing procedures to the extentpracticable is that they reflect the many legal authorities applicableto oil and gas leasing and operating decisions and they are responsiveto current management needs. In addition, agency personnel, the oil andgas industry and other persons interested in the management of NationalForest System resources are familiar with existing procedures and requirements.Therefore, maintaining the existing procedures to the extent possible willreduce confusion over Agency roles and operator responsibilities in theleasing and development of Federal oil and gas resources located on NationalForest System lands. Many of the new requirements and procedures that are included in the proposedrule are designed to define the role that the Forest Service will playin the approval of oil and gas leasing and operations because of the expandedauthority of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Leasing Reform Act.Other of the new requirements are included to implement the direction inthe Leasing Reform Act to the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulationsestablishing bonding standards. The following briefly describes the role that the Forest Service wouldplay under the proposed rule in the issuance of oil and gas leases, theapproval of operations on the leaseholds, and the administration of thoseoperations. The Bureau of Land Management cannot issue leases for Federal oil and gasresources on National Forest System lands without the approval of the ForestService. Therefore, the Forest Service must develop a process for makingdecisions as to whether to authorize the Bureau of Land Management to offerNational Forest System lands for leasing. First, the Forest Service proposesto identify lands with potential for leasing based on existing oil andgas production, known geologic potential, or industry interest in an areaand, in cooperation with the oil and gas industry, the Bureau of Land Management,and interested publics to develop a schedule for reviewing those areas.Then the Forest Service would determine if these lands with leasing potentialare legally available for leasing. The Agency would review whether availablelands are suitable for exploration and development by considering whetheroil and gas development is consistent with the forest land and resourcemanagement plan or not precluded by the plan or if the lands could be suitablefor leasing if stipulations governing surface uses were added to a lease.The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would then evaluate theadequacy of the Forest Plan Environmental Impact Statement or other NationalEnvironmental Policy Act documents to determine if additional NationalEnvironmental Policy Act analysis and documentation is required. The ForestService would make a determination of an area's suitability for oil andgas leasing and give public notice of the decision. A suitability determinationwould be an appealable decision under Forest Service appeals procedures(36 CFR 211.18). The Forest Service would then forward its decision tothe appropriate Bureau of Land Management office. The Bureau of Land Management would then be able to offer such lands forcompetitive sale. If there were no bidders for the offering, the landswould then be available for lease by an over-the-counter application processfor a period of 2 years. After the Bureau of Land Management issued a lease, the operator mightseek to conduct surface disturbing activities on the lease. In accordancewith the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act, the proposed regulationswould require an operator to obtain Forest Service approval of a surfaceuse plan of operations before conducting operations. In order to coordinatereview of proposed operations by the Forest Service and the Bureau of LandManagement and to ease the administrative burden on the public, the proposedrules would direct operators to submit surface use plans of operationsinvolving National Forest System lands to the Bureau of Land Managementas part of the operator's Application for a Permit to Drill. The proposedrule specifies the information that the operator would have to includein a surface use plan of operations for a lease on National Forest Systemlands and encourages the operator to contact the appropriate local ForestService office for assistance in preparing the proposed plan. Upon receiptof a surface use plan of operations involving operations on National ForestSystem lands, the Bureau of Land Management would forward that plan tothe Forest Service for its review and approval. Prior to, or in connection with, the submittal of a surface use plan ofoperations, the operator could request that the Forest Service authorizethe Bureau of Land Management to modify or waive a stipulation includedin a lease at the direction of the Forest Service. The proposed rule wouldpermit the Forest Service to grant such a request in the circumstancesspecified after compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of1969 and other applicable laws. The Forest Service would give public noticeof its decision on a substantial stipulation modification or waiver requestin a newspaper of general circulation. The decision would be subject toadministrative appeal under the procedures at 36 CFR 211.18. The Forest Service would review a proposed surface use plan of operationsfor adequacy using the criteria proposed in the rule. If the plan of operationswas adequate as submitted, the Forest Service would approve the plan. Ifthe plan of operations was not adequate, the Forest Service could disapprovethe plan or approve the plan subject to operating conditions which wouldrender the plan adequate. As part of the review process, the Forest Servicewould establish bonding requirements for any plan of operations that wouldbe approved. In accordance with the requirements of the Federal OnshoreOil and Gas Leasing Reform Act, the proposed rules would direct an operatorto post a bond in an amount sufficient to ensure reclamation and the restorationof any lands or surface water adversely affected by the operations priorto the commencement of operations.    At the conclusion of the surface use plan of operations review process,the Forest Service would advise the operator and the appropriate Bureauof Land Management office of the decision on a proposed plan and, if appropriate,the bonding requirements for the operations. Public notice of the decisionalso would be given. The decision would be subject to administrative appealunder the procedures at 36 CFR 211.18.    If the operator completed the operations authorized by the initial surfaceuse plan of operations and desired to conduct further operations, the operatorwould be required to submit a supplemental plan of operations which wouldbe subject to review and approval in the same manner as an initial planof operations.  The proposed regulations would require an operator to perform reclamationon the leasehold as the operations were completed. The proposed regulationsalso provide for the staged release of bonds as reclamation is completed. Under the proposal, the operator would be required to conduct operationson the leasehold in accordance with the terms of the lease, these regulationsand an approved surface use plan of operations. The proposed rule alsodetails the remedies that the Forest Service would have if the operationsconducted by the operator were not in compliance with the terms of thelease, these regulations and an approved surface use plan of operations.Initially, the Forest Service would try to obtain the operator's voluntarycompliance with the applicable provision. If the operator refused to voluntarilycomply, the proposed rules would provide that the Forest Service wouldissue the operator a notice of noncompliance specifying a deadline forthe operator to bring the operations into compliance. The proposed regulationsprovide that if the operator still failed to come into compliance the ForestService would take the following actions, as appropriate:  1. If the noncompliance appeared to be material, the Forest Service wouldinitiate a material noncompliance proceeding in accordance with the proceduresproposed in the regulations. If the Forest Service official presiding overthe proceeding found that the noncompliance was material, the operatorand the Bureau of Land Management would be so advised. An operator foundto be in material noncompliance would be ineligible to receive furtherFederal oil and gas leases or assignments until the operations were broughtinto compliance.  2. If the noncompliance was resulting in an imminent danger to public healthor safety or in irreparable resource damage, the Forest Service could suspendthe approval of the surface use plan of operations. The proposed rule providesthat the suspension would last until the operator brought the operationsinto compliance.  3. If the noncompliance was resulting in an emergency, the Forest Servicecould take whatever measures were necessary to abate the emergency. Theproposed regulations would require the operator to reimburse the ForestService for the full cost of such abatement actions.  The proposed rule also advises the operator that the Forest Service couldseek criminal penalties for the operator's noncompliance pursuant to 36CFR Part 261.  In addition to these requirements which would be set forth at 36 CFR Part228, Subpart E, the proposed rules would make conforming changes in twoother existing Forest Service rules_36 CFR 211.18, which governs the ForestService administrative appeal process; and 36 CFR Part 261, which specifiesconduct on the National Forest System which is prohibited and for whichcriminal penalties may be imposed.  The following diagram illustrates how oil and gas leasing and operationswould be administered on National Forest System lands:<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M001  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 660  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Rule </ITAG>The rules governing Forest Service procedures for responding to and managingoil and gas leasing and surface disturbing operations on National ForestSystem lands would be codified as a new Subpart E of Part 228 of Title36 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The following section-by-sectionanalysis describes in detail the provisions of the proposed rule. Section 228.100 Scope and applicability. This section specifies the scope of Forest Service responsibility in oiland gas leasing and further states that the rules would apply to leasesand operations in effect as of the effective date of the rule as well asto new leases issued under the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing ReformAct of 1987. This section also makes clear that surface uses off a leaseholdrequire authorization by the authorized Forest officer and cites the majorexisting rules that apply to those uses.Section 228.101 Definitions. This section defines special terms used in the proposed rules. Section 228.102 Determination of lands suitable for leasing. The Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987 made significantchanges in the manner in which Federal oil and gas leasing is conducted.Under the Act, application for leases will no longer be accepted untilafter lands have been offered for competitive sales. Therefore, in orderto offer leases, Federal Agencies must take the initiative to identifylands suitable for leasing and to make those lands available for competitivesale through the Bureau of Land Management. Under the proposed rule, eachForest Supervisor would, within 6 months of the effective date of the rule,identify those areas of the National Forest System in which there is potentialfor leasing and that have not been previously evaluated and develop a schedulefor determining their suitability for oil and gas leasing. The Forest Supervisor,in cooperation with the oil and gas industry and the Bureau of Land Management,would give first priority to those areas having the highest potential forleasing. This would meet the mandate in the <T3>Mountain States Legal Foundation vs Andrus (1980)</T3> decision torequire the Forest Service to develop a leasing process and would eliminateneedless analyses of areas where no potential for oil and gas leasing exists.Potential lessees would have the opportunity to participate in the processof establishing the priority for reviewing those areas identified as havingleasing potential. When areas are reviewed for their suitability for leasing, this sectionwould require the authorized Forest officer to identify those areas legallyavailable (that is, not withdrawn from leasing), review the Forest landand resource management plan for direction, and identify conditions ofoccupancy that would be included as lease stipulations. The Forest Serviceand the Bureau of Land Management would cooperate in meeting the analysisand documentation requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.This section would require the authorized Forest officer to give writtennotice to the Bureau of Land Management of the outcome of a suitabilitydetermination, which in effect is the notice to consent, or not to consent,to leasing certain lands. The authorized Forest officer would include anystipulations as a condition of leasing derived from the suitability determination.For decisions on suitability for leasing, the Regional Forester is theauthorized Forest officer. Section 228.103 Notice and transmittal of suitability decision. This section would require public notice in a newspaper of general circulationof the suitability decision and of appeal rights available under 36 CFR211.18. It should be noted that in addition to this public notice requirement,under existing agency procedures, all who request notice of a suitabilitydecision would receive direct notice. This section also specifies inclusionin all leases to which the Forest Service consents of a standard stipulationthat gives the lessee notice that the Secretary of Agriculture retainsthe authority to preclude all operations on a leasehold in those exceptionalcircumstances where further environmental analyses indicate such actionis appropriate, that lease operations are subject to the regulations ofthe Secretary of Agriculture and that the operator must submit a surfaceuse plan of operations for Forest Service approval or disapproval. TheSecretary of Agriculture is specifically requesting public comments onthe effect of this retention of authority and its effect on perceived leasevalue and compared with lease rights currently specified at 43 CFR 3101.1-2.Section 228.104 Consideration of request to modify lease terms. This section would allow an operator to request that the Forest Servicemodify or waive a stipulation included in a lease at the direction of theForest Service. The proposed rule would permit the Forest Service to grantsuch a request in the circumstances specified after compliance with theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other applicable laws. TheForest Service would give notice of its decision on a substantial stipulationmodification or waiver request and of appeal rights under the proceduresat 36 CFR 211.18 in a newspaper of general circulation.Section 228.105 Operator's submission of a surface use plan of operations.The proposed rule would clarify that an operator would submit a surfaceuse plan of operations that would involve the National Forest System throughthe appropriate Bureau of Land Management office. Having the Bureau ofLand Management continue to receive the entire Application for Permit toDrill (APD) package will provide for more efficient administration andless burden to an operator than submitting information separately to twoagencies. This section also encourages cooperation between the operatorand the Forest Service in preparing a surface use plan of operations priorto formally submitting an APD, thus eliminating potential problems earlyin the process. This section specifies surface use plan of operations contentwhich is the same information as currently required for lands administeredby the Bureau of Land Management.Section 228.106 Review of a surface use plan of operations.This section establishes the process by which the Forest Service wouldreview a surface use plan of operations. Under this proposed process, theauthorized Forest officer would base the approval of a surface use planof operations on the terms of the lease, direction in the Forest land andresource management plan in effect at the time the surface use plan ofoperation is submitted, and information derived from the result of NationalEnvironmental Policy Act analyses. When lands are determined to be suitable for leasing, a lessee can normallyexpect that future lease operations would be authorized, but the ForestService must explicitly approve operations under a lease and comply withthe National Environmental Policy Act before approving or denying suchoperations. Past experience demonstrates that most problems can be solvedby the Forest Service and the lessee working cooperatively to obtain necessaryrevisions in the design of a proposal. However, if the circumstances warrant,the Forest Service will use the authority granted the Secretary of Agricultureby the Leasing Reform Act of 1987 to disapprove proposed operations. Inexceptional circumstances, this could mean that no operations would beapproved on a leasehold. This section also gives notice that the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, implementing regulations at 40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508, andForest Service implementing policies and procedures must be followed aspart of the Agency's review of an operating plan.This section would further require the authorized Forest officer to advisethe Bureau of Land Management of the reasons when a proposed surface useplan cannot be processed within 3 days after the conclusion of the 30-daynotice period. Finally, this section requires the Forest Service to givepublic notice of a decision on a surface use plan of operations and appealrights available under 36 CFR 211.18.Section 228.107 Surface use requirements.This section establishes requirements that would apply to oil and gas operationson the National Forest System. The requirements address the design of accessfacilities, protection of cultural and historic resources, fire preventionand control, maintaining fisheries, wildlife and plant habitat, conductof reclamation, safety measures, waste disposal, and watershed protection.It is necessary to establish minimum surface use requirements for operationson National Forest System lands in order to carry out the direction inSection (g) of the Leasing Reform Act of 1987 which directs that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * For National Forest lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, shallregulate all surface disturbing activities conducted pursuant to any leaseissued under the Act and shall determine reclamation and other actionsas required in the interests of conservation of surface resources.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The surface use requirements of the rule are the same requirementsas currently contained in standard stipulations that the Forest Service,until recently, has attached to all lease issuance decisions or recommendations.Establishment of specific National reclamation standards would not be appropriatebecause of the diverse land surfaces, vegetation, animal life, soil types,etc., and the uniqueness of many surface disturbances. Therefore, standardsfor reclamation and mitigation measures to minimize adverse impacts areestablished for each operation by the Bureau of Land Management and ForestService personnel during the onsite inspection as part of the review ofeach Application for Permit to Drill and the accompanying surface use planof operations. General guidance on reclamation and operating standardsis contained in a joint Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, andGeological Survey publication entitled, ``Surface Operating Standards forOil and Gas Exploration and Development,'' Second Edition, August 1978.Section 228.108 Bonds.This section would establish that bonding is required before surface disturbingactivities can be authorized and would require the authorized Forest officerto fix the bond amount at a sum adequate to ensure compliance with 30 U.S.C.226(g). A bond required by the authorized Forest officer would be heldby the Bureau of Land Management. This would provide for more efficientmanagement and less burden on the public. The proposed rule does not establisha fixed bond sum because the extent of reclamation required varies by siteand type of operation. The authorized Forest officer is in the best positionto determine what is an adequate bond amount based upon on-the-ground sitespecific review of proposed operations.Section 228.109 Indemnification.This section would provide a means of protecting the United States Governmentfrom liability as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments causedby an operator's use or occupancy. This language is similar to that foundin 36 CFR 251.56, terms and conditions for special use permits, and isnecessary to adequately regulate occupancy. Section 228.110 Temporary cessation of operations.The Agency has experienced a high incidence of operators temporarily ceasingoperations without adequate stabilization of the site or protection ofresources or public safety. This section addresses this problem by requiringnotification to the Forest Service of temporary or seasonal cessation ofoperations. This notification would allow the authorized Forest officerto work with the lessee in taking appropriate interim measures to protectresources or public safety. Section 228.111 Compliance and inspection.Section (g) of the Leasing Reform Act of 1987 (30 U.S.C. 226(g)) providesremedies in situations where operators fail to comply in any material respectwith the reclamation, bonding, and other standards established by the Secretaryof Agriculture. Because the sanctions of the Act can result in loss ofleases, it is important to establish compliance procedures that ensureoperators timely notice of noncompliance, opportunity to remedy the violation,and opportunity for a hearing. Sections 228.111 through 228.113 set forthboth informal and formal compliance and hearing procedures. Section 228.111would require the Forest officer to give notice to an operator when thatoperator is found in noncompliance with an approved surface use plan ofoperations, with stipulations made part of the lease at the direction ofthe Forest Service, or with these proposed regulations. Because it is theintent of the Forest Service to resolve problems at the local level ifpossible, this section is designed to encourage cooperation between theForest Service and the operator. This section also notifies the operator of other statutes applicable totheir operations. Section 228.112 Notice of noncompliance.This section of this proposed rule would establish the formal proceduresto be followed if the authorized Forest officer has determined an entitymay have failed or refused to comply in any material respect with the reclamationrequirements and other applicable standards established under 30 U.S.C.226(g) of the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987. Theauthorized Forest officer would be required to refer noncompliance suchas, but not limited to, operating without an approved surface use planof operations or failure to complete reclamation. The section describesthe manner of serving notice and states that the authorized Forest officershall either refer the matter to a compliance officer for review and/orsuspend the surface use plan of operations in the event of imminent dangersto public health or safety and irreparable resource damage. The sectionalso provides for the abatement of such emergencies as irreparable resourcedamage through actions by the Forest Service and for billing of the operatorfor costs incurred by the Agency to perform such abatement actions. Section 228.113 Material noncompliance preceedings.This section would establish the procedure for review and determinationof material noncompliance. The Deputy Chief of the National Forest Systemwould review a noncompliance referral made by the authorized Forest officerand if evidence supports a reasonable belief that an operator has failedto come into compliance with the requisite standards and that noncompliancemay be material, the Deputy Chief would initiate the material noncomplianceproceedings. The section requires due notice to the operator and specifiesthe content of the notice, permits an operator to submit argument and allowsfor an informal hearing at the operator's request or a fact finding conference.The proposed rule specifies that the compliance officer's decision shallbe based on the entire record and prescribes the content of decision letter.Upon determining that an operator is in material noncompliance, the complianceofficer would be required to notify the Secretary of the Interior of his/herfindings. This section of the proposed rule would require the Deputy Chieffor the National Forest System to maintain and distribute a list of operatorsin noncompliance to help ensure that pursuant to the 1987 Act, such operatorsdo not receive future leases. Paragraph (g) of this section also providesfor petition of the authorized Forest officer to rescind a finding of noncomplianceonce an entity has come into compliance. Reinstatement of an operator'sopportunity to obtain future leases is clearly envisioned by the 1987 LeasingReform Act and the petitioning process proposed in this section providesa manageable process for achieving reinstatement when an operator has comeinto compliance. Section 228.114 Additional notice of decisions.In compliance with 30 U.S.C. 226(f) of the Leasing Reform Act, this sectionrequires the Forest Service to post notices provided by the Bureau of LandManagement of lease sales, requests for modification of lease stipulations,and applications for permit to drill. The section specifies where suchnotices are to be posted and makes clear that posting notices is in additionto the public notice requirements imposed elsewhere in the rule. 36 CFR 211.18 Appeal of decisions of forest officers.In addition to the proposed rules at Part 228, Subpart E of Title 36, thisrulemaking contains an amendment to the rules governing appeal of decisionsof authorized Forest officers. Under this proposed rule, 36 CFR 211.18would be amended to exempt from those rules, appeal of decisions relatedto determining lands suitable for leasing made pursuant to 36 CFR 228.102and related to the issuance of a notice of noncompliance or to materialnoncompliance proceedings related to oil and gas leasing operations onNational Forest System lands pursuant to 36 CFR 228.11 through 228.112.Section 228.113 of the proposed rule would establish separate administrativeprocedures for material noncompliance decisions. It should be noted that,under this conforming amendment, the general public also could not appealdecisions related to compliance and noncompliance decisions. This exclusionis appropriate since compliance decisions are solely matters affectingthe business relationship that exists between the operator and the ForestService based on the terms of a Federal lease and an approved surface useplan of operations. Those decisions that are appealable are identifiedin this proposed rulemaking. 36 CFR Part 261 Prohibitions. Ths rulemaking also contains an amendment to the rules governing occupancyof the National Forest System. Under this proposed rule, 36 CFR Part 261,Subpart A_General Prohibitions, would amend ``Operating Plan'' to includea surface plan of operations as provided for in 36 CFR Part 228, SubpartE. This is necessary to differentiate between a plan of operations at 36CFR Part 228, Subpart A. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>These proposed rules have been reviewed under the Department of Agricultureprocedures and Executive Order 12291, and it has been determined that theseregulations are not major rules. This regulation will not have an effecton the economy of $100 million or more and, in and of itself, will notincrease major costs to consumers, geographic regions, industry, or Federal,State, and local agencies. These regulations are essentially proceduraland represent no change in current requirements on lessees, assignees,or operators and, therefore, it will not adversely affect competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates based enterprises to compete in foreign markets. It has also been determined that these proposed rules do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of itslimited scope and application. Therefore, the proposed rules are not subjectto review under the Regulations Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 60 et seq.).It should be noted, that while the requirements of the surface use planof operations proposed in this rule are new requirements by the Departmentof Agriculture, the requirements are identical to that now required bythe Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior, as partof an Application for Permit, to Drill or Sundry Notice and, therefore,will not increase the amount or type of information a lessee would haveto submit for operations on National Forest System lands. The total burden hours on an operator are estimated to be 125 hours annually.These hours are the same as estimated by the Bureau of Land Managementin its request for Office of Management and Budget clearance of Forms 3160-3and 3160-5. These forms were cleared through December 31, 1988, and areassigned clearance numbers 1004-0136 and 1004-0135 respectively. An operatorproposing to conduct surface disturbing activities on the National ForestSystem is required to utilize these existing Bureau of Land Managementforms and submit information required in this proposed rule to the appropriateBureau of Land Management office. However, because these requirements will not be levied by the Departmentof Agriculture, a request for approval of these new reporting requirementshas been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to 5CFR Part 1320. Those wishing to comment on the proposed information requirementsof this rule are encouraged to send their written comments to the ForestService and to the: <ITAG tagnum="15">USDA Regulatory Desk Officer, Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Attention: Docket Library, Room 3201 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503</ITAG>Based on both experience and environmental analysis, this proposed rulewill have no significant effect on the human environment, individuallyor cumulatively. Therefore, it is categorically excluded from documentationin an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement (40CFR 1508.4).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>36 CFR Part 211Administrative practice and procedure, Fire prevention, Intergovernmentalrelations, National forests.36 CFR Part 228Administrative practices and procedures, Environmental protection, Mines,National forests, Public lands_Mineral resources, Rights of way, Reportingand recordkeeping, Surety bonds, Wilderness areas.36 CFR Part 261Law enforcement, National forests.Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed toamend Chapter II of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 211_ADMINISTRATION</ITAG>1.
