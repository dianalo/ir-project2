Applied Microbiology Inc., based in New York, said Cyanamid will pay $3 million for 15% of its 4.5 million shares outstanding, plus the right to market its genetically engineered protein enzymes.    Applied Microbiology said the enzymes can instantly kill a bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, that causes bovine mastitis, a deadly disease common in cows that has become increasingly resistant to standard antibiotic treatment.    As part of the agreement, Cyanamid also is expected to be a partner in developing other genetically engineered products for the veterinary and other health-care fields.    American Cyanamid has interests in chemicals and medical and consumer products. </TEXT></DOC>
