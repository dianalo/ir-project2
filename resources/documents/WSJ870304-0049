The law judge for the Federal Labor Relations Authority said the Teamsters' meeting with the aides sent a signal from the Army that it believed the Teamsters could represent the 2,500 civilian workers at a base in Fort Sill, Okla., better than the National Federation of Federal Employees. The labor relations authority oversees labor relations for federal workers.    The meeting was held several days before the union election. The two unions were competing to become the bargaining agent for those workers, and federal law requires government agencies to remain neutral in such contests.    The Teamsters won the election after a bitter campaign in which it used the meeting with administration officials as an example of its influence. Army officials have said they weren't aware of the pending election when the meeting was held.    The judge said he couldn't order a new representation election, but urged that the three-member labor relations board prohibit the Army from participating in any meetings with the Teamsters while the election is still in question.    A Teamsters spokesman said the union's lawyers will recommend that its local appeal the ruling to the board, while a National Federation of Federal Employees representative said it believes the board is likely to require a new election as a result of the ruling. An Army spokesman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    The Teamsters have been staunch supporters of President Reagan, giving him his only major labor union support in 1980 and 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
