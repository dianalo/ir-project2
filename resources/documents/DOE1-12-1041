Suggestionsfor further development of the coal industry are given: in distributionof mines priority should be given to East China, Northeast and otherregions where transport is convenient, industry highly developed andnatural resources rich; in developing the productive capacity of coalmines, emphasis should be placed on reform of techniques in current mines;great importance should be attached to processing and utilization ofcoal; the following key problems in mining science and technology shouldbe addressed - improve geological exploration techniques, acceleratethe pace of shaft sinking, develop mechanized coal winning, improve minesafety technology, enhance the technical level of underground power supplyand communications and develop mine automation techniques, and speedup development and application of computers in the coal industry.</TEXT></DOC>
