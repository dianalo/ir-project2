Lee (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> X </CO><IN> TNM TRA </IN><TEXT>   USX Corp. said it plans to sell its huge railroad and shipping lines for more than $500 million to a joint venture it is forming with Blackstone Group and the units' senior managers.    The giant steel and energy company said it signed a letter of intent to sell the transportation businesses, but declined to give further details of the leveraged transaction. The units had unusually low 1987 sales of about $380 million due to a strike at the company's steel mills.    Sources close to the negotiations said Pittsburgh-based USX will retain about a 45% stake in the new venture. Blackstone, an investment banking firm known for its high-powered political connections, will own the remainder except for approximately 5% to be sold to management.    The sale is the latest step in a long-running strategy at USX of shedding assets to pay for its costly diversification into oil. The move represents the company's largest divestment since 1986, when USX sold the bulk of its chemical operations to the public for $570 million.    For Pittsburgh-based USX, the move brings the company about halfway through a three-year program to sell off $1.5 billion in assets by 1990. Although the company had intended to reach that goal this year, the divestitures have taken more time than initially expected.    For Blackstone, one of Wall Street's more visible so-called boutique investment banks, the transaction is the first in which it has taken an active ownership position. &quot;We believe in the return of the Rust Belt,&quot; said Stephen A. Schwarzman, a cofounder.    The announcement was made early yesterday before USX shares closed unchanged at $31.375 each in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The freight and barge lines, which carry coal and iron ore for USX and others, are thought to have a book value of around $500 million. It's unclear, though, how large a gain the transaction would generate, and USX officials declined to comment. Negotiation of a definitive agreement and necessary regulatory approval, too, are likely to delay the recording of any gain until the second half.    Still, analysts praised the move, noting that it strengthens prospects for an increase in the company's 30-cent-a-share dividend. &quot;I had been expecting an increase by the end of the third or fourth quarter, and this only reinforces that,&quot; said Michelle Galanter Applebaum of Salomon Brothers Inc.    Andrew Gray, an analyst at Pershing andamp; Co., noted that the sale will enable USX to cut its hefty $6.60 billion in debt. Noting the company's record profitability in steel, Mr. Gray also predicted a rise in the company's quarterly payout.    The heavy debt load reflects the company's diversification under Chairman David M. Roderick. In 1982, USX acquired Marathon Oil Co. for $5.93 billion in cash and notes, and in 1986 added Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp. for $3 billion in stock. To pay the hefty Marathon debt, he has sold $5 billion in assets, including coal reserves, timberland and the company's own corporate headquarters.    The timing of the planned sale seemed to reaffirm Mr. Roderick's tendency to hold onto assets until they peak in market value. For instance, the company's diversified operations, which include the transportation businesses, posted an operating loss of $302 million in 1986. In this year's first quarter, they posted pretax profit of $97 million, thanks mainly to a cyclical upturn in heavy industry. Similarly, USX didn't sell its chemicals business until the petroleum-sensitive business returned to profitability two years ago, aided by a plunge in world oil prices.    Blackstone's Mr. Schwarzman said several potential buyers looked at the businesses but passed on them because of past labor problems and because the businesses are highly regulated. Moreover, he added, &quot;many financial buyers don't like the idea of having corporate partners for their deals.&quot;    New York-based Blackstone, which eschews hostile takeovers, was formed in 1985 by Peter G. Peterson, a former commerce secretary during the Nixon administration and former co-chairman of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. Among its partners are Roger C. Altman, a former assistant secretary in the Carter administration, and David A. Stockman, President Reagan's former budget director.    Included in the transaction are the company's six railroads and its three shipping lines. The units employ about 4,000 workers and operate 300 locomotives and 20,000 rail cars over 2,000 miles of track. Also included are 14 ships and 305 barges. According to Blackstone, the rail operations are the nation's third most profitable.    The remainder of USX's diversified businesses remain on the block. Selling them is the task of Charles A. Corry, the company's president and Mr. Roderick's heir apparent. The saleability of the assets, which include a commercial real estate developer and a fertilizer company, isn't clear. </TEXT></DOC>
