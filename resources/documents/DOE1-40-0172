Thesize ranges of the glass microspheres tested were 5-44, 127-44, and 355-420{mu}m with copper sphere diameters of 1.0, 1.4, and 2.0 cm. Average heattransfer coefficients were determined from transient cooling measurementsmade on either a stationary or moving copper sphere with an embeddedthermocouple at its center. The following variables were studied: gassuperficial velocity, bed particle diameter, sphere diamater, and spheredescending velocity in the fluidized bed. Heat transfer was improvedby a factor of 5 or greater near incipient fluidization as a result ofthe forced motion of the sphere, with a diminished effect in heat transferbeing observed at the higher superficial velocities.</TEXT></DOC>
