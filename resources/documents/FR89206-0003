Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this final rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately seven handlers of California olives regulated underthis marketing order each season, and approximately 1,390 olive producersin California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the SmallBusiness Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those having annual gross revenuesfor the last three years of less than $500,000, and small agriculturalservice firms are defined as those whose gross annual receipts are lessthan $3,500,000. Most, but not all, of the olive producers and none ofthe olive handlers may be classified as small entities. Each marketing order administered by the Department of Agriculture requiresthat the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year shall apply to allassessable commodities handled from the beginning of such year. An annualbudget of expenses is prepared by each administrative committee and submittedto the Department for approval. The members of administrative committeesare handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiarwith the committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services and personnelin their local areas and are thus in a position of formulate appropriatebudgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus,all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provideinput. The assessment rate recommended by each committee is derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of the commodity (e.g., pounds,tons, boxes, cartons, etc.). Because that rate is applied to actual shipments,it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income topay the committee's expected expenses. Recommended budgets and rates ofassessment are usually acted upon by the committees shortly before a seasonstarts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budgetand assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the committeeswill have funds to pay their expenses. The California Olive Committee unanimously recommended 1989 fiscal yearexpenditures of $1,883,290 and an assessment rate of $25.39 per ton ofassessable olives received by handlers. In comparison, 1988 fiscal yearbudgeted expenditures were $1,627,482 and the assessment rate was $23.92.Major expenditure items budgeted for the 1989 fiscal year compared withthose budgeted in 1988 (in parentheses) are $469,540 ($435,434) for programadministration, $60,000 ($51,948) for production research, $760,000 ($540,000)for consumer advertising, $398,500 ($494,000) for food service advertising,and $195,250 ($106,100) for public relations. The $255,808 increase inbudgeted expenditures from 1988 is mainly for advertising and promotionactivities needed to market this year's larger crop. An estimated assessment income of $1,883,938 based on handler receiptsof 74,200 tons of assessable olives will be utilized to cover 1989 fiscalperiod expenses. Last year's assessable olives totalled 57,300 tons. Theproposed rule indicated that $245,473 in excess 1988 assessments wouldbe placed in the committee's reserve. Closer review of the committee'sfinancial statements reveals that the $245,473 are reserve funds derivedfrom excess assessments from fiscal years prior to 1988, not excess 1988assessments. Therefore, the provision authorizing unexpended funds fromthe 1988 fiscal year to be carried over as a reserve has been removed.A proposed rule inviting comments on this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53000). The commentperiod ended January 9, 1989. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costsare in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed onto producers. However, these costs will be significantlyoffset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order.Therefore, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Based on the foregoing, it is found and determined that the budget of expensesand assessment rate are reasonable and will tend to effectuate the declaredpolicy of the Act. The budget of expenses and assessment rate should beexpedited because the committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay itsexpenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the Secretaryalso finds that good cause exists for not postponing the effective dateof this action until 30 days after the date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(5 U.S.C. 553). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 932 </ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, olives, California.
