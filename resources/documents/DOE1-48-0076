Itis shown that there exists East-West asymmetry of the front configurationof interplanetary disturbances propagating from the Sun. Such asymmetryin average is about 30 deg in the Earth orbit. The most probable causesof asymmetry can be both spiral twisting of the disturbance structuredirectly associated with solar rotation and interaction of this disturbancewith the spiral interplanetary magnetic field and, probably, with thecorotating large-scale structure in the solar wind.</TEXT></DOC>
