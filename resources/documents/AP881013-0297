But Japan's trade surplus with the United States declined,falling to $4.648 billion from $4.860 billion in September 1987,the government said.   Japan's exports during September rose 13.6 percent from a yearearlier to $23.118 billion, while imports increased 18.9 percent to$15.376 billion, the ministry said.   In August, Japan's trade surplus registered $4.935 billion,while in September 1987 it was $7.424 billion.   After declining for 15 months from year-earlier levels, thecountry's trade surplus reversed direction in July, causing concernamong officials that a resurge in the imbalance could result inincreased trade friction.   But ministry officials said it was too early to determinewhether the increases would continue.   ``We think it's going to go up and down for a while,'' said aministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But thereare too many imponderables, like how exchange rates and oil priceswill move.''   The officials said the value of imports had been held down bydeclining world oil prices. Crude imports fell 29.9 percent invalue in September from a year earlier to $1.166 billion, theministry said.   In the past several months, the U.S. dollar has been stableagainst the yen, reportedly helping to drive up Japanese exports.But this week, the yen began rising rapidly, potentially makingJapanese products more expensive and therefore less competitiveoverseas.   If oil prices remain low, the officials said, imports likelywill stay down, resulting in larger trade surpluses.   ``But if the yen goes up against the dollar, that would curbexports and increase imports,'' one official said. ``So a lotdepends on how those things will change in the future.''   Manufactured goods accounted for 51.5 percent of all importsduring the month, surpassing the 50 percent mark for the first timeand reflecting the decrease in oil imports, the ministry said. Theprevious high was 49.9 percent in April.   Exports to the United States rose 6.6 percent from a yearearlier to $8.097 billion, while imports from the United Statessurged 26.2 percent to $3.448 billion, the ministry said. It wasthe ninth month in a row that the bilateral surplus has fallen fromyear-earlier levels.   Exports to the European Community increased 16.6 percent to$3.895 billion, while imports grew 29.9 percent to $1.881 billion,yielding a trade surplus of $2.014 billion, compared to $1.891billion in September 1987, the ministry said.   Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia also increased to $1.834billion from $1.103 billion a year earlier, it said.   Japan measures its trade on a customs-clearance basis, whichincludes freight and insurance costs on imports but not in exports.Its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were included inboth categories.</TEXT></DOC>
