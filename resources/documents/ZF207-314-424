(GSS) promises relief by enablingdevelopers to concurrently code an application for Windows, OS/2 PresentationManager and the Macintosh.andM;XVT (Extensible Virtual Toolkit) is designed to simplify the programmingprocess for graphical environments.andP;  Published by GSS, of Beaverton, Ore.,andO;XVT was developed by Advanced Programming Institute Ltd.andM;''XVT provides a higher-level programming interface that is also a commondenominator for multiple environments,'' said Dan Fineberg, GSS' director ofmarketing.andP;  ''It is the first common applications programming interface thatwill support Windows, Presentation Manager and the Macintosh.''andM;XVT is a library of C functions that programmers substitute for the nativetool-kit functions of the Macintosh, Windows and Presentation Manager.andP;  EachXVT function translates into the native tool-kit function for the threeenvironments.andP;  For example, XVT's ''newwindow'' function calls the NewWindowfunction on the Macintosh and the CreateWindow function on Windows.andM;Programmers use the same set of source code for all platforms.andP;  Porting anapplication involves writing a resource file for the target machine, and thenrecompiling and relinking the source code, the resource file and the XVTlibrary using the XVT version for the target machine.andM;The tool kit will help large corporations developing applications formultiple platforms, said Fineberg.andP;  Furthermore, he said, because XVT linksin resource libraries for each environment when the application is compiled,applications will look like native Mac or Windows applications.andM;XVT also simplifies the coding for a graphical environment by providing ahigher-level structure for applications.andP;  With XVT, one call can produce manynative Windows or Mac tool-kit calls and can handle many programming details.andM;According to one early user, XVT offers a good compromise, when portabilityof the program is key.andP;  ''XVT gives you a subset of what's available on yourplatform, so you wouldn't want to use it if you need to get every bit ofpower out of your Mac,'' explained John Rice, senior scientific programmerfor Intelligenetics Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., biotechnology softwarefirm.andP;  ''But if I stay within the guidelines of XVT, then I'm guaranteed mydesign will be completely portable.''andM;Rice is designing a data-bank-submission application to enable scientistswith different computers to enter data into Genbank, a nationwide geneticdatabase.andM;GSS will begin shipping versions of XVT for Windows and the Macintosh at theend of this month.andP;  A version for Presentation Manager is scheduled for July,said Fineberg.andP;  XVT has a list price of $595, and two versions cost $995.andM;In the fall, GSS plans to release a version of XVT for the Open SoftwareFoundation's Motif graphical interface for Unix, and a character-basedversion for DOS, added Fineberg.andM;XVT for Windows supports the Microsoft Windows/286 and Windows/386 softwaredevelopment kits, including Microsoft C. XVT for Presentation Managersupports Microsoft C and the Microsoft or IBM OS/2 1.1 Toolkits.andP;  For theMacintosh, XVT supports Lightspeed C or the MPW C compiler.andM;----------Additional reporting by Paul M.
