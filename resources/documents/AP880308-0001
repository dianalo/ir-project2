Albert Gore Jr.'s Tennessee roots helped him in theSouth, exit polls said.   Enormous support for the Reagan administration fueled GeorgeBush's sweep, powering the vice president to victory amongvirtually all segments of the Republican party, the polls said.   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts was helped in Florida byolder voters. Lagging among the Democrats was Rep. RichardGephardt, apparently damaged by attacks from Dukakis and Goresuggesting he had flipped-flopped on important issues, the surveysindicated.   While Jackson did better among white voters than he did in his1984 race for the Democratic nomination, ``This is a hell of apolarized election in terms of race,'' said Sheldon Gawiser, an NBCNews poll analyst. ``He's still not making major inroads into thatvote, with the exception of Massachusetts and Virginia.''   Jackson polled more than nine in 10 Southern black voters, pollssaid. Among white voters, ABC News exit polls said Jackson hadabout 9 percent in the South, while the CBS News-New York Timespoll said he had 8 percent. NBC figures ranged from 4 percent inTennessee to 15 percent in Virginia and 19 percent in Massachusetts.   Surveys of Republican voters as they left the polls foundoverwhelming approval of President Reagan, and those voters wentstrongly for Bush, who had stressed his links to the administration.   ``It's coattails, there's no doubt about it,'' said Gawiser.``Reagan is extremely popular in the South and Bush is certainlyriding those coatails.''   In Georgia and Florida, for example, the CBS News-New York Timespoll found approval of Reagan at the 80 percent level, and Bush wontwo-thirds of those voters, said Pama Mitchell, CBS manager ofsurveys.   ``He's carrying conservatives. He's carrying moderates. This isalmost boring: It's all Bush,'' Mitchell said.   The support for the vice president was as longstanding as it waswidely spread. Sixty percent of the Republican voters in Georgia,for instance, had made up their minds even before last month's NewHampshire primary, and most of them went for Bush, Mitchell said.   However, she said, Bush also won among the Republicans whodecided more recently whom to support. And in Florida, she noted,he even won four in 10 of the minority of voters who did notapprove of Reagan.   Among the Democratic candidates, Jackson as expected enjoyedmassive support from black voters, but also won support from about9 percent of the white voters across the South, ABC News exit pollssaid.   Blacks made up 25 percent of the Democratic vote, and more thannine in 10 of them went for Jackson, ABC and CBS reported. Amongwhite voters across the South, about a third each supported Dukakisand Gore, and 15 percent backed Gephardt, ABC reported.   ``Gephardt is not doing well; his negatives are high,'' saidMitchell, of CBS. ``It looks like maybe this stuff has beensticking where they say he's been flip-flopping.''   She also noted that trade issues, a keystone of Gephardt'scampaign, was considered important by few Southern voters.   Gore, meanwhile, won support from the 27 percent of Democratswho called themselves conservative, with the backing of 35 percentof that group, ABC said. Dukakis won 23 percent of conservatives,Jackson 19 percent.   ABC said Gore also led among the Democratic voters, a third ofthe total, who voted for Reagan in 1984. Thirty-five percent wentfor Gore, 25 percent for Dukakis and 15 percent for Gephardt.   Jackson and Dukakis split the moderates, with 26 percent each,and Jackson won 43 percent of the liberal vote, to 28 percent forDukakis, ABC said.   In Florida, with its large population of retirees, 47 percent ofthe Democratic voters were 60 and over, CBS reported, and 52percent of them backed Dukakis.   The CBS-Times poll indicated that some of Gore's supportvis-a-vis Dukakis stemmed from the Tennessee senator's Southernroots. Fifty-two percent of Democratic voters in the South saidthey were born there, and 31 percent of them backed Gore to 20percent for Dukakis. Thirty percent were for Jackson.   Gore and Dukakis split the white vote in the South, 35 percentfor Gore and 33 percent for Dukakis, Mitchell said. The two menalso split those Democratic voters, 30 percent of the total, whodecided since Saturday.   The CBS-Times results for the South as a region had a margin ofsampling error of about 2 percentage points, Mitchell said. Theresults based on state samples varied, but mostly were about 5percent.</TEXT></DOC>
