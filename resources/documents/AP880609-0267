Spokesman Steven Anreder said Wednesday that the ``SEC hasnotified us that (it) has authorized its staff to file civilaction,'' but he would not comment on reports that the chargesinclude securities fraud.   Reading from a prepared statement, Anreder said, ``While thereis no certainty as to when the SEC might actually file the charges,we are eager to resolve this matter ....''   The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that Drexelchief executive Frederick H. Joseph told the firm's employees in amemo that the SEC had authorized filing of charges of securitieslaw violations against Dreexel and four of its employees, whom hedid not identify.   The employees involved are believed to be chief junk-bond dealerMichael Milken, his brother Lowell and two people described astraders, according to unidentified sources quoted in today's WallStreet Journal.   Joseph's memo also said the firm was prepared to negotiate aresolution of the charges with the SEC even though he denied thatthe firm or its employees had engaged in any wrongdoing, accordingto the Times.   The newspaper said the memo's emphasis was on Drexel's newwillingness to settle any charges. ``As a major financialinstitution, we are aware of the benefits in getting this casebehind us,'' Joseph was quoted as saying.   Drexel has been the subject of investigations by the SEC, theU.S. attorney's office and a federal grand jury since the breakingof the insider trading scandal surrounding former stock speculatorIvan F. Boesky.   Boesky, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in April 1987, isbelieved to have provided investigators with information related toalleged wrongdoing by Drexel.   Anreder said Drexel is eager to have the opportunity to confrontBoesky, who he described as ``a convicted felon and an admittedliar,'' in a fair forum.   Without Boesky, the ``principal source of the charges, therewould be no action,'' Anreder said. ``From the very beginning ofthis investigation 18 months ago, we have stated that we areunaware of any wrongdoing.''   The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the SEC wanted tohold off action to avoid interfering with the criminalinvestigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York.   The head of the SEC's enforcement division, Gary Lynch, andofficials at the office of Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney inManhattan, both declined comment.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder also declined to comment on Drexel,but he said Wednesday that he had requested more resources bedevoted to investigating securities law violations.   ``We have urged the Justice Department to give increasedresources to the criminal investigation of securities lawviolations,'' he told reporters during a break in an unrelatedcongressional hearing.   ``While there has been some increment in the resources of theNew York office, we think there could be more and we think therecould be more throughout the country,'' he said.   Drexel acknowledged in February that it and some of itsemployees had been targeted for civil charges by the SEC staff.Milken, the best known Drexel executive, pioneered the market forhigh-yield, high-risk bonds that have become a staple of Drexel'sbusiness.   During congressional hearings in April, Milken refused totestify, confirming he was under investigation by a grand jury inNew York.</TEXT></DOC>
