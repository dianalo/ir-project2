But traders said the market's tone remained fundamentally firm, with the dollar well supported at current levels.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8363 marks, down from 1.8424 marks the previous day, and at 132.43 yen, down from 133.16 yen.    The dollar was quoted at 132.40 yen in early trading in Tokyo Wednesday.    &quot;There's no money to be made between now and Thursday so people are going to reduce their risk&quot; by trimming long, or overbought, dollar positions, said Javier Santalla, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank. &quot;That doesn't mean the dollar's going to drop significantly, but it has found equilibrium for the time being,&quot; he said.    Mr. Santalla said the release of U.S. June retail sales data tomorrow could inspire some movement before the trade figure is released the following day.    In addition to retail sales and the trade data, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is slated to testify before the Senate Banking Committee today, and U.S. producer-price data and industrial-production figures will be disclosed Friday.    Many traders said they doubted Mr. Greenspan's testimony would provide much impetus to foreign-exchange markets, but caution dictated that positions be squared ahead of his remarks.    Foremost in most minds, however, are the May trade data. According to a survey of economists by Dow Jones, a rebound in U.S. imports likely outweighed modest export gains in May, pushing the merchandise-trade deficit to a seasonally adjusted $11.2 billion from an adjusted $9.89 billion gap in April.    Traders said the dollar could jump as high as 1.9000 marks if the trade deficit is again less than $10 billion, but could only fall to about 1.8100 marks even if it is significantly wider than $11 billion.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $437 an ounce, up $2.40. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.9 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $437.40 an ounce.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Tuesday, July 12, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
