In a letter to the House and Senate, Reagan said he endorsed thepay-raise recommendations of the Commission on Executive,Legislative and Judicial Salaries. He said ``fair compensation forthose who bear the responsibility for effective functioning of ourgovernment is critical at this juncture of history.''   In advance of the president's decision, which was made publiclate Thursday by the White House, consumer activist Ralph Naderlabeled it the ``greatest salary grab in government history.''   The raise will increase the pay for members of Congress andfederal judges to $135,000 a year unless both houses of Congressreject it by Feb. 8.   In his letter today, the president coupled his support for thepay hike with a plea that Congress at the same time bar outsideincome such as speaking fees, as the commission recommended lastmonth.   ``The current system undermines public faith in the integrity ofsenior federal officials, particularly in the legislative branch,''Reagan wrote. ``Congress should move immediately to enactlegislation that takes a comprehensive approach to the problemsposed by honoraria, including payments for articles, speeches andappearances, and other forms of financial benefits.''   President-elect Bush, asked today about the pay raise, said hesupports whatever Reagan decides, but may take another look at theissue when he becomes president.   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big payincrease at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything otherthan to get this deficit under control. ... I am vice president andI will be supportive of what the president decides. I've done thatfor seven and eleven-twelfths years and I don't plan to change now.So let's see what the president says and then when the ball is in mycourt and the buck is stopping on my desk, I may have something elseto say about matters of this nature,'' Bush said.   He spoke after the White House released Reagan's lettersupporting the pay increase.   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said, ``I'm very pleased that thepresident has decided to make this decision. This is a pay raise forall the top-level federal officials ... but, of course, we(Congress) take all the heat.''   Nader said, however, ``Mr. Reagan has put an end to any furtherpretense that he wants his federal deficit reduced. He has thumbedhis nose at the vast majority of the American people, Republican,independent and Democrat alike who are against the greatest salarygrab in government history.''   Reagan could have modified the proposal made last month by thecommission. Under the law, unless both the House and Senate vote tohead off the pay increases, they will automatically take effect 30days after the plan is submitted to Congress with the proposedfederal budget on Monday.   The commission recommended that members of Congress and federaldistrict judges, who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000. TheHouse speaker's salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000, and thatof majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would getraises from their current $99,500 to $155,000.   The commission also recommended that Congress raise thepresident's pay to about $350,000 from the current $200,000, whereit has stood since 1969. However, such a hike would not take effectuntil 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising apresident's pay during his term.   Fazio said he believes the Senate is likely to reject the raise,as it has in past years when the House allowed pay hikes to takeeffect. The lawmaker said he believed a ban on honoraria would beenacted if the raises were accepted. He said that would keep theoverall benefit to lawmakers less than that for judges.   On Thursday, the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union deliveredpetitions to the White House bearing the names of 13,000 people whooppose the raise.   Spokesman David Keating said after the White House announcement,``I think Reagan's action is outrageous. Adopting fat pay raises fortop officials will sabotage President-elect Bush's flexible spendingfreeze proposal ... Raising congressional pay by 50 percent is aboutas popular as trading arms with the ayatollah.''   A White House statement said that since 1969, ``salary levels forsenior federal officials _ executives, legislators and judges _ havedeclined 35 percent in constant dollars while the compensation ofworkers in the private sector has kept pace with inflation.''   ``Federal trial judges are currently earning less than somejunior lawyers in private practice and are leaving the bench inrecord numbers,'' it said.   In addition, deputy White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht saidthe National Institutes of Health had trouble attracting qualifiedscientists for senior positions in critical areas such as cancerresearch, and the average length of service in the executive branchhad fallen to 18 months.   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the salary commission, said last monthhe expected strong pressure to abolish honoraria and other forms ofoutside pay.   The public interest group Common Cause has reported thatlawmakers accepted a record $9.8 million in speaking fees fromspecial interest groups in 1987.   The pay recommendations directly affect about 2,500 top federalemployees and indirectly affect 10,000 other high-level employeeswhose pay is tied to salaries in the top echelon.</TEXT></DOC>
