MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oil imports last month surged to the highest ratesince 1980 as domestic production fell and consumption rose,reviving fears that foreign producers may soon control more thanhalf of U.S. oil supplies, energy analysts said Wednesday.   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oilproducers and refiners, said U.S. crude oil production fell to 7.9million barrels a day, a 3.4 percent drop from January 1988.   Alaskan production, which in recent years offset declines inother parts of the United States, slipped for the second straightmonth with no major new oil fields tapped, the Washington,D.C.-based group said in its monthly report. About a quarter of U.S.oil comes from Alaska.   Imports of oil and oil products surged to a rate of 8.2 millionbarrels a day, an increase of 20.6 percent over the January 1988level of 6.8 million barrels. It was the first month that importsaveraged more than 8 million barrels since 1980, the API said.   Last year, imports jumped to the highest level since 1979 anddomestic production hit a 12-year low, according to an earlier APIreport.   Of the 18.3 million barrels of oil consumed daily in the UnitedStates, 45 percent is from foreign sources and experts say thatnumber will soon exceed 50 percent.   About 15 percent of U.S. imports are from Persian Gulf countries.Larger percentages come from Latin America, including Venezuela andMexico, and from the North Sea.   ``We better do something to ensure that this dependency doesn'tcause us economic and security problems,'' said John Sawhill, formerdeputy energy secretary and now a director of the McKinsey andamp; Co.Inc. management consultant firm.   ``We're putting ourselves in a situation where we're graduallygoing to become more dependent and at some point OPEC is going to bein a position to curtail our supplies.''   Weak oil prices have curtailed incentives to find and develop newoil in the United States. Furthermore, because imports are cheaper,experts predict they will continue increasing.   Proven, or recoverable, U.S. reserves are about 26.5 billionbarrels, or 3 percent of total world reserves, said John Redpatch,an oil analyst with Security Analysis Inc. in Washington.   That compared with 170 billion barrels, or 19 percent, of provenreserves held by Saudi Arabia, he said.   ``Out of all the oil left in the world today to be produced andexploited...about two-thirds is in the Middle East,'' he said. ``Sosooner or later if we continue consuming oil the way we do now weare going to become dependent on Middle East supplies _ sometime inthe next century.''   A Commerce Department study released Tuesday said that althoughgrowing U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a long-range threat tonational security, it has not jeopardized the Pentagon's ability tofight a major non-nuclear war, so no government action is needed torestrict oil imports.   However, proposals are expected in Congress for an oil import feeaimed at curbing the trend toward growing imports and shrinkingdomestic output.   The institute's latest report also said demand for oil and oilproducts surged last month, with deliveries up more than 6 percentfrom the previous year for the third consecutive month.Approximately 18.3 million barrels a day of petroleum products weresupplied in January, compared with 17.2 million barrels in January ayear ago.   Despite the increase in imports, inventories fell 13 millionbarrels, or 2.3 percent, with part of the decline the result ofhigher refinery activity. Refinery utilization rose from a rate of82.8 percent to 85.4 percent, the highest monthly level since 1979.   Gasoline deliveries jumped last month by 5.8 percent to a rate of7 million barrels per day, compared with 6.68 million barrels inJanuary 1988.   Home heating oil and diesel fuel, in the distillate category,rose 4.7 percent last month, while kerosene jet fuel rose 3.3percent and residual oil was up 9.3 percent compared with theprevious January.</TEXT></DOC>
