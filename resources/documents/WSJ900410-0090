But the increase wasmore than offset by a 35% decline in operating income frominformation services, to $35.8 million from $54.6 million.The decline was attributable mostly to losses from aforeign-exchange trading service being introduced by theTelerate Inc. subsidiary.   Dow Jones noted that the year-to-year first-quartercomparison for information services operating income isdistorted by the inclusion this year of 100% of the expensesof developing The Trading Service; a year ago, the servicehadn't begun operation, half its development losses werebeing borne by a 50% partner, since bought out, andTelerate's share of those losses wasn't included in operatingresults but was reported as an investment by the equitymethod of accounting.   Dow Jones's first-quarter operating income fell 22% to $62million from $79.8 million. Revenue rose 5% to $427.1 millionfrom $406.8 million.   Net also was reduced by increased interest expense andgoodwill amortization related to Dow Jones's acquisition ofTelerate, completed in January 1990, by a decline inoperating income at the community newspapers segment, and bya higher effective tax rate.   Information services segment revenue rose 9% to $184.3million. Excluding Telerate, revenue from the informationservices group, which includes Dow Jones News Services andDow Jones News/Retrieval, rose 7.9%.   Revenue for business publications, which includes The WallStreet Journal and its overseas editions, Barron's magazineand other publications, increased 3.5% to $189.3 million;operating income for the segment showed the third consecutivequarterly increase. Journal advertising linage in the quarterdeclined 3.9%; Barron's linage rose 2.1%.   Operating income of Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the communitynewspapers segment, fell 39% to $4.5 million; revenuedecreased 2.5% to $53.4 million. Advertising linage at the 23daily newspapers fell 8.8% in the quarter.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Dow Jones closed at $28.875, down 25 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
