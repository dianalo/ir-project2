The insurance exchange is facing a $61 million juryverdict because it allegedly cheated, and with help from fourlaw firms, stonewalled a mother and son who owned arestaurant and bar in this town of 14,000. The award, whichincludes $60 million in punitive damages, is believed to bethe largest ever &quot;bad faith&quot; judgment in the U.S. against aninsurer, and the largest verdict of any sort ever issued byan Alaskan court.</LP><TEXT>   The trouble for Lloyd's began on the afternoon of May 28,1989, when the restaurant, called The Narrows, burned to theground, taking with it all the personal effects and lifesavings of owners Jeanne Lindley and her son Carson, wholived in a downstairs apartment. The Lindleys had taken outan insurance policy with Lloyd's and Gotham Insurance Co. ofNew York in March 1988 that was valued at $280,000 at thetime of the fire. Soon, they filed a claim.   Four months after the fire, and some time after Mrs.Lindley had taken a job as a cook on a local ferry, partlybecause she needed a place to sleep, Lloyd's and Gothamresponded with an accusation that the Lindleys had lied andexaggerated their losses. Citing the alleged fraud, thepolicy was canceled. The Lindleys responded with a suit inAnchorage Superior Court.   Gotham softened its hard line, but Lloyd's proved no moreeager to cooperate in court. Soon, four firms were aiding inits defense, including Mendes andamp; Mount in New York and theAnchorage firms of Lynch, Crosby andamp; Sisson, Robertson Monagleandamp; Eastaugh and Delaney Wiles Hayes Reitman andamp; Brubaker.   Murphy Clark, an Anchorage lawyer for the Lindleys, saysLloyd's abundant legal counsel were particularly adept atfrustrating his requests for needed documents. Last December17, Judge Victor Carlson found that &quot;these discovery abuseswere knowingly and willfully done with a view of preventingplaintiffs from obtaining relevant evidence.&quot; As a sanction,Judge Carlson, who recently retired, held Lloyd's liable forthe entire face amount of the policy, leaving the issues ofadditional compensatory and punitive damages for jurors.   &quot;Lloyd's lied,&quot; asserts Mr. Clark. For instance, he sayshe requested information about other bad-faith cases againstLloyd's underwriters. &quot;They said there weren't any,&quot; he says,&quot;when in fact, there were.&quot;   The 12-person jury deliberated for two days, and on theafternoon of Jan. 16, dropped its bombshell.   According to foreman Dorothey Moore, the jury saw the caseas &quot;an opportunity to once and for all set the recordstraight that the little guy had to receive his rights.&quot; Mrs.Moore actually opposed punitive damages, and says some jurorssuggested they be as high as $200 million. The jury concludedthat $60 million was apt punishment because it approximatedLloyds's revenue in a day, she adds.   What the verdict says about how Alaskans feel about bars,insurance companies, or last-frontier justice in general isnot clear. A 60-year-old converted cannery, The Narrows wascertainly a fixture in the community. &quot;It is definitely thetype of thing that people used as a guide -- you know, gothree blocks past The Narrows, and go left,&quot; says TenaWilliams, publisher of the Ketchikan Daily News. Andcertainly, evidence indicated that the Lindleys suffered realhardship.   Through its lawyers, Lloyd's declines to comment. Itrecently took steps toward getting the verdict tossed out,and such huge awards usually are reduced by the trial judgeor the appellate court. Leo Fraser, a partner with Mendes andamp;Mount, says he knows of no other verdict that Lloyd's hassuffered in the U.S. quite the dimension of the Ketchikanone.   Mr. Clark says, &quot;There is no question {the verdict} willstand up.&quot; He says Mrs. Lindley, who declined through Mr.Clark to comment, plans to give some of her share of themoney to charity. If the award survives appeal, Mr. Clarkwill not do so badly himself, having taken the case on acontingent-fee basis, meaning he will likely end up with acut of at least one-third. Such arrangements are needed sobig companies will not &quot;suppress poor people,&quot; says Mr.Clark, in a recent phone interview from Hawaii, where he sayshe is &quot;hiding out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
