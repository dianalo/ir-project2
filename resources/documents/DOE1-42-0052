In the hydrocracking of diphenylmethane (C-C bond cleavage),the acidic property of catalysts played an important role under low reactionpressure, while the hydrogenation activity of catalysts was importantunder high reaction pressure. The catalytic properties changed not onlywith the change of reaction pressure, but also with the existence ofwater vapor, the changes being dependent on the kinds of catalysts. Threedifferent reaction routes with Mo, Fe and Ni catalysts supported on variousoxides were proposed. In the hydrocrackings of diphenyl ether and benzylphenyl ether (C-O bond cleavage), the hydrogenation activity played animportant role. The reaction mechanism was elucidated in connection withcatalyst property. A deuterium tracer study revealed that hydrogen usedin the hydrocracking came directly from gas phase hydrogen rather thanfrom the solvent (tetralin). In the hydrocracking of carbazole (C-N bondcleavage), the catalytic activity was in the order of Niandgt;Moandgt;Fe, whichwas changed by presulfiding and the kinds of catalyst supports used.8 refs., 7 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
