Hamilton alledged department officials knowinglytried to force the company into bankruptcy and by so doing force Promis intothe public domain.andM;Senior District Court Judge William B. Bryant agreed with Bankruptcy JudgeGeorge F. Bason Jr.andP;  that &quot;the government acted willfully and fraudulenty toobtain property that it was not entitled to under the contract.&quot;andP;  Bryantthrew out the arguments made by Justice in its appeal of the bankruptcyruling and approved compensatory damages of $6.1 million.andP;  Punitive damagesare yet to be established.andM;In the appeal, Justice attorneys accused Bason of overstepping the BankruptcyCourt's boundaries and delving into culpability.andP;  But Bryant disagreed.andM;&quot;What is strikingly apparent from the testimony and depositions of keywitnesses and many documents is that Inslaw performed its contract in ahostile environment that extended from the higher echelons of the JusticeDepartment to the officials who had the day-to-day responsibility forsupervising its work,&quot; Bryant found.andM;Justice officials have until Friday to appeal Bryant's ruling.andP;  JusticeDepartment spokesman Michael Robinson last week said no decision has beenreached on an appeal.andM;Hamilton, though pleased wtih the court's ruling, said he wants thecongressional inquiries to continue.andM;&quot;The Justice Department has vilified the [banktruptcy] judge in the press andbefore Congress, professed the innocence of its officials, and stonewalledall attempts by Congress, and the press for a public accounting,&quot; he said.andM;Meanwhile, Hamilton and Inslaw have filed another suit with the DistrictCourt.andP;  With the latest suit, filed last last month, Hamilton hopes to forceAttorney General Richard L. Thornburgh to investigate the Inslaw situationagain.andM;&quot;It's our position that they never conducted an investigation,&quot; Hamiltonsaid.andP;  &quot;They just pretended to.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
