After 20 years of often ruthless rule, the aging Siad Barre, whois believed to be in his 80s, is isolated internationally and besetby strife in his country.   His power, most foreign observers agree, now extends no morethan 140 miles outside this seaside city, built three centuries agoby an Arab ruler.   ``Beyond that, it's a no man's land of war and banditry,'' saysone Western diplomat.   But one foreign diplomat notes that those who oppose Siad Barremay well have trouble agreeing on anything beyond their oppositionto him. The diplomat said there is no obvious person with the cloutor charisma to replace Siad Barre and lead the nation to a morestable future.   Strategically located at the tip of the Horn of Africa on theeastern approach to the Red Sea, Somalia used to be wooed by boththe Soviet Union and the United States.   But the Soviet Union abandoned Somalia in favor of rivalEthiopia in their 1977 war over the Ogaden, long a disputedterritory on their central border.   Now the United States, which happily picked up Siad Barre as aclient when Moscow dropped him, has tired of his human rightsabuses and stricken him from its list of friends.   Washington has withheld or canceled more than $50 million in aiddating back to 1987. Britain, France and other Western donors alsohave slashed funds.   Their growing unhappiness reached a peak in July when SiadBarre's personal bodyguards, marked by their red-fringed berets,crushed protests in the capital. According to diplomats, the guardsthen rounded up 47 civilians, took them to a nearby beach, killedthem and buried the bodies in the sand.   That came little more than a week after the United Statesdedicated a new, $35 million embassy, the largest in sub-SaharaAfrica with a compound that boasts three swimming pools and anine-hole golf course.   By the end of 1990, plans call for slashing the embassy staff ofabout 430 in half, reflecting the sharp reductions in aid and thenumber of people needed to administer it.   Tribal rebellions in the north and south of the nation and clanwarfare in the center have sapped Somalia's treasury and helpedproduce a sharp drop in export earnings. Never large to begin with,they have fallen from about $100 million in 1986 to an estimated$60 million in 1989.   All of this has left Siad Barre with a bankrupt economy, anannual inflation rate of 120 percent, an unpayable foreign debt of$2 billion and a growing chorus of discontent that reaches eveninto many government offices.   Many of those offices barely function, the bureaucrats who manthem forced to find other sources of money on the outside or tosell government services and favors to supplement their meagerincomes.   Siad Barre has tried to defuse the growing opposition to hisregime by appointing a commission to rewrite the constitution topermit multiparty elections late in 1990, a step his critics say istoo little too late.   He also has offered to enter into unconditional peace talks withhis armed opponents, especially the Somali National Movement whichhas routed government forces in much of the north of the country.He had no takers.   ``The opposition sees the government as crumbling. That's whythey're probably in no hurry to talk,'' said another diplomat, who,like the first, spoke on condition he not be identified.   Siad Barre faces another, smaller insurgency in southern Somaliathat surfaced only early this year. It has been largely stalled inrecent months by a rainy season that ends in January, when renewedfighting is widely expected.   The southern group, known as the Somali Patriotic Movement, hasspoken of a possible alliance with the northern insurgents, whohave been fighting off and on since 1981, but there is no evidenceof unity between them.   In Mogadishu, where robberies and burlaries are soaring as thedesperately poor take to crime to meet their needs, public servicesare virtually non-existent and many neighborhoods are almost alwayswithout electricity because, it is said, the diesel fuel needed torun the city's only power generator is siphoned off and sold bygovernment employees.   Siad Barre, whose exact age is unknown but is thought to be inthe 80s, bemoans the loss of Western aid and denies thewell-documented human rights abuses that led to its reduction.   ``It's no good to abandon your friends in a time of need,'' hesaid in an interview in a luxuriously furnished conference room inone of the many buildings that dot the large, walled compound inwhich he lives and works.   On the question of human rights abuses, he replied: ``It isbaseless. What's the use of arguing about it? It is being used as ameans to reach a certain goal. We do not believe it is fair.''</TEXT></DOC>
