U.S. retail sales and employment data supported the viewthat the recession has run its course, traders said. But asbullish economic news is now no surprise to the market, thedollar's 5.4% rise against the mark since May 31 might havebeen a little too much for now, traders said.</LP><TEXT>   Dollar sales by some central banks, including the Bank ofJapan, and rumors that others banks were intervening, alsohad a braking effect on the U.S. currency; the dollaractually ended down against the yen. Dealers said it couldpull back to 1.7850 marks and 140.00 yen.   The dollar reached intraday highs of 1.8091 marks and142.05 yen around the start of U.S. activity. But in late NewYork trading, the dollar was trading at 1.7987 marks, up from1.7907 marks late Wednesday. The U.S. currency was alsochanging hands at 141.29 yen, down from 141.52 yen. Sterlingwas trading at $1.6345, off from $1.6445.   At mid-morning Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at141.12 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 141.75 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.7968marks, up from 1.7910 marks at Tokyo's close Thursday.   Despite the correction, &quot;you've got to be impressed by thedollar; it's holding a very firm tone,&quot; said Peter Iversen, aforeign exchange trader at Shawmut Bank in Boston.   Other traders said that even as the dollar declined,buyers were there all the way down and trading was orderly.&quot;The demand for dollars is still there, that's obvious,&quot; Mr.Iversen said.   For now, however, &quot;we have reached an overbought situationagainst some of the currencies,&quot; said Robert White, foreignexchange manager at First Interstate Bank of California inLos Angeles. Other traders said they expect a furthercorrection today.   Before profit-taking set in, Keith Cheveralls, vicepresident and manager of foreign exchange at Nippon CreditBank in New York, said the &quot;major contributory factor&quot;tugging on the dollar was the expectation that interventionwas possible.   Dealers said the Bank of Japan intervened twice as thedollar approached 142.00 yen early in Tokyo dealings, andearlier the Reserve Bank of Australia was spotted sellingdollars for yen at around the same level. There was talk thatthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York sold dollars for yenlate in U.S. trading Wednesday, but it couldn't be confirmedand the Fed wouldn't comment.   In Europe, traders said the Swiss National Bank solddollars when the currency reached 1.5455 Swiss francs. TheSwiss National Bank, which usually confirms itsinterventions, denied it sold dollars.   Joseph Volpicella, foreign exchange manager at WestpacBanking Corp. in New York, said there was a sense in themarket that the German central bank also may have solddollars, but it couldn't be confirmed.   The central banks are moving quietly to damp the dollar'srise, Mr. Volpicella said. He said that if an unsuccessfulFed intervention were publicized, that could undermine theagency's future efforts in the marketplace.   Other traders doubted that the Fed even has theinclination to force the dollar lower. One participant whoregularly deals with the Fed said officials he talked with&quot;don't seem to me to be at the ready&quot; to intervene. &quot;I'm . .. under the impression that they are long {foreign}currencies and short dollars,&quot; he said.   The Commerce Department said retail sales were up 1% inMay to a seasonally adjusted $152.48 billion. The increasefollows a revised 0.4% decrease in April, which wasoriginally estimated as a 0.1% decline.   Separately, there was another bit of promising employmentnews as the U.S. Labor Department said that initial claimsfor state unemployment insurance on a seasonally adjustedbasis fell 38,000 in the week ended June 1, to 401,000 from439,000 the previous week.   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that a rise ingasoline prices pushed the producer price index up aseasonally adjusted 0.6% in May. The increase compared withan adjusted rise of a 0.2% in April. &quot;Core&quot; PPI, which is theindex minus the volatile food and energy components, rose anadjusted 0.4% in May after rising 0.2% in April.   After release of the retail sales and producer price data,President Bush's top economic adviser, Michael Boskin, told aprivate group in Washington: &quot;We're starting to see somesections of the economy in the negative column move to thepositive column.&quot;   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $370.20 an ounce, unchanged.Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $369.50 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
