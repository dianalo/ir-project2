The stationblackout transient for BWR Mark I Power Plant is considered. The TRAPMELT3models of evaporization, chemisorption, and the decay heating of RCSstructures and gases are adopted in the analysis. The RCS flow modelsbased on the density-difference between the RCS and containment pedestalregion are developed to estimate the RCS outflow which carries the revaporizedfission product to the containment. A computer code called REVAP is developedfor the analysis. The REVAP is incorporated with the MARCH, TRAPMELT3and NAUA codes of the Source Term Code Pack Package (STCP). The NAUAcode is used to estimate the impact of revaporization on environmentalrelease. The results show that the thermal-hydraulic conditions betweenthe RCS and the pedestal region are important factors determining themagnitude of revaporization and subsequent release of the volatile fissionproduct. 8 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
