The Chronicle, which has a circulation of 425,534, denied as recently as last week that it was for sale. But the Chronicle's owner, the Houston Endowment, was required under tax laws adopted in 1969 to sell the newspaper eventually. The law gave the nonprofit foundation 20 years to divest itself of the commercial enterprise.    The Chronicle, in fact, had been claiming for months that it wasn't yet for sale -- and, according to a representative for another bidder, had passed up the opportunity to obtain a much higher price. William Dean Singleton, owner of the Dallas Times Herald, offered $500 million in cash for the newspaper last October, but was spurned by the endowment, according to Christopher Shaw, chairman of Henry Ansbacher Inc., an investment banking firm that represents Mr. Singleton.    Just two days ago, Mr. Singleton made a new offer for the Chronicle, but reduced the price to $415 million in cash to reflect the adverse effects of federal tax overhaul on depreciation rules, Mr. Shaw said. Although the offer was higher than Hearst's -- which consists of $300 million in cash and $100 million in notes -- the endowment didn't respond to the offer, Mr. Shaw said. Mr. Singleton couldn't be reached.    &quot;We're not the injured party; the endowment is the loser,&quot; Mr. Shaw asserted. &quot;The foundation has a responsibility to conduct itself in the interest of its beneficiaries. They haven't done so in this case.&quot;    Even on Hearst's terms the price ranks the purchase among the top ever paid for a newspaper. Officials of the Houston Endowment weren't present at a news conference here last night and couldn't be reached at the endowment office.    Richard J.V. Johnson, president and publisher of the Chronicle, said that the negotiations with Hearst had spanned &quot;a few months,&quot; but that no one from the Chronicle had been involved. &quot;It was the largest offer I know of,&quot; Mr. Johnson said in response to questions about other offers that the newspaper had received.    New York-based Hearst, the nation's ninth-largest newspaper chain, already owns newspapers in the Texas cities of San Antonio, Beaumont, Laredo, Midland and Plainview. Closely held Hearst has more than tripled in size since 1979, spending $1.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions and on the development of new properties.    The Chronicle's Mr. Johnson and Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive of Hearst, gathered newsroom employees last evening to relate the news and assure them that major changes weren't planned. The Chronicle recently reduced employment by 184 to about 1,700.    In a statement, Mr. Bennack moved to assure the city of Houston that Hearst would maintain the hometown values of the Chronicle. &quot;We intend to support and preserve the unique character of this great newspaper,&quot; he said.    The unusual ownership of the 86-year-old Chronicle is a legacy of Houston builder Jesse H. Jones, who bought the newspaper in the 1920s and bequeathed it to the city through the endowment, a charitable and educational foundation. Over the years the endowment's directors supported the interests of oilmen and bankers, and the Chronicle's news coverage reflected those sentiments.    Texas congressional representatives lobbied unsuccessfully for years for the endowment to obtain an exemption from the tax law in order to maintain local ownership. The Chronicle's management studied a leveraged buyout, or a purchase by an employee stock ownership plan, but rejected the ideas as too financially risky.    &quot;We looked at it,&quot; said Mr. Johnson. &quot;We would have borrowed the money, but could we have paid it back?&quot;    Lately, the Chronicle has seen tougher competition from its cross-town rival, the Houston Post, which has a daily circulation of 316,209. The Post was bought by the Toronto Sun Publishing Co. in 1983 from Houston's Hobby family.    Proceeds from the sale will fund the endowment's activities, Mr. Johnson said. </TEXT></DOC>
