Of those Mexicans who intend to emigrate, 1.3 million said theywould go to California and 800,000 said they would look for work inLos Angeles.   ``A lot of those who say they are going may not make it,'' saidJorge Bustamante, a Mexican immigration expert and president ofTijuana's Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Baja California.   The survey, published Monday, was done Aug. 5-13. Face-to-faceinterviews were conducted with 1,835 Mexicans 18 years and older in42 randomly selected cities and towns throughout Mexico.   Those interviewed were selected through a process called quotasampling, which ensures the sample conforms to Mexican censusfigures according to sex, income, age and locale.   Economic disparity is still a top reason why most said they wouldchoose the United States. A majority of the poor surveyed, 69percent, said Mexican children sometimes go hungry. Almost 6 percentsaid they were very likely to live in the United States by 1990.   In a country of about 85 million residents, 6 percent would equalmore than 4.7 million people. And 23 percent of those who indicatedthey may move picked California as their destination, with 14percent specifically choosing Los Angeles.   The survey showed 41 percent liked the economic opportunityoffered by the United States. Sixteen percent said they liked thefact that it is a rich country.   U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg, a supervisor for theSan Diego area, said stricter regulations are decreasing illegalborder crossings.   ``It's a beginning,'' he said. ``If only one in five want tocome, that's a good deterrent.''   The poll also measured what Mexicans disliked about the UnitedStates: 38 percent mentioned ethnic discrimination; 42 percent citeddrug problems; and 24 percent said the country is domineering.   Bustamante estimates there are 1.75 million Mexicans livingillegally in the United States, a figure U.S. immigration officialsdispute.   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
