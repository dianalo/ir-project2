Phil Gramm, R-Tex., seeking to ease whathe called the ``human tragedy'' of Central Americans deniedpolitical asylum in the United States, says he will introducelegislation requiring would-be refugees to apply before they enterthis country.   As of last Thursday, about 625 Central Americans who had beendenied asylum were under detention in the 315-acre Port IsabelService Processing Center run by the Immigration and NaturalizationService just north of Brownsville, Texas. They were awaitingdeportation.   ``They have the very real human tragedy of having to walk homeafter spending their worldly goods to get here,'' Gramm said. ``It'snot humane. I want to let them know if they're accepted (aspolitical refugees) before they come.''   The Central Americans were detained under a policy that tookeffect last Dec. 16, denying those who seek polical asylum the rightto travel within the country while their applications or appeals areprocessed.   Gramm, in an interview Friday, said 98 percent of the CentralAmerican refugees who arrive in Brownsville are being deniedpolitical asylum.   ``Having thousands a month come into Brownsville creates a hugeoverload, many bring communicable diseases that we long ago stoppedworrying about, they have no housing, and have been a tremendousburden on the local economy,'' Gramm said.   Under his proposal, refugees from El Salvador or Nicaragua couldapply for asylum in Honduras or Mexico.   Gramm said he discussed the bill last week with Attorney GeneralRichard Thornburgh and is confident of gaining administrationsupport. Gramm said he would introduce the bill Tuesday.   Under the new policy, INS officials are speeding up the review ofapplications while detaining the applicants. Previously,applications could take weeks to process and aliens were released ontheir own recognizance while awaited appeals or deportation.   As many as 2,000 refugees a week had been crossing the Rio Grandeinto Texas, but the number has slowed to a trickle under the newpolicy.   Only immigrants who can prove they have suffered politicalpersecution are entitled to asylum. Those who come for economicreasons are subject to deportation. INS officials say most CentralAmericans arriving in South Texas do not qualify for refugee status.</TEXT></DOC>
