<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-1235 </DOCNO><TEXT>Direct heat use of geothermal energy in the United States is recognizedas one of the alternative energy resources that has proven itself technicallyand economically, and is commercially available. Developments includespace conditioning of buildings, district heating, groundwater heat pumps,greenhouse heating, industrial processing, aquaculture, and swimmingpool heating. Forty-four states have experienced significant geothermaldirect use development in the last ten years. The total installed capacityis 5.7 billion Btu/hr (1700 MW{sub t}), with an annual energy use ofnearly 17,000 billion Btu/yr (4.5 million barrels of oil energy equivalent).In this report we provide an overview of how and where geothermal energyis used, the extent of that use, the economics and growth trends. Thedata is based on an extensive site data gathering effort by the Geo-HeatCenter in the spring of 1988, under contract to the US Department ofEnergy. 100 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
