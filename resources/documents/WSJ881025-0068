Many traders had looked upon the meetings of the two OPEC committees as a panacea for a market glutted with petroleum -- when, in fact, the committees had no authority to take official action on a new production-cutting accord.    That fact, however, was lost in the hysteria of selling that began in the Far East, shifted to Europe and hit New York like a steamroller. When it was over, futures prices for crude oil had plunged by at least $1 a barrel, with prices of gasoline, heating oil, naphtha and practically everything made from petroleum trailing closely behind.    &quot;It was a perfect case of unrealistic expectations in a market that had been pumped up too high,&quot; said Peter Beutel, analyst for Elders Futures Inc., New York.    Amid the disappointment over the absence of a production-cutting agreement, traders also overlooked several positive developments arising from the weekend OPEC meetings -- chiefly, signs that the ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were pursuing the broad outlines of a plan to cut production, and that the foes of Iran and Iraq had adopted a more conciliatory stance toward each other in the talks.    Fixing a new production ceiling and bringing Iraq back into the quota system -- in which it has refused to participate since 1986 -- will be the top items on the agenda at OPEC's next full meeting next month in Vienna, when all 13 member nations will be present and empowered to take official action.    &quot;The meeting was intended to outline the key issues and begin a dialogue,&quot; said Jack Wilkinson, chief economist for Sun Co., Philadelphia, who observed the Madrid meetings. &quot;And that is what happened.&quot;    Certainly, the eight ministers comprising the committees might have agreed on -- and perhaps publicly announced -- a recommended production-cutting agreement. But their failure to do so doesn't mean they can't reach such an agreement during the full conference next month. Working in private may improve their chances of reaching an agreement in November.    When the committee meetings broke up Saturday, &quot;Everyone was inside the same boat,&quot; said Antonio M. Szabo, manager of Petroleum Planning at Bonner andamp; Moore, a Houston oil-consulting concern.    OPEC still has plenty of opportunity to fail, of course. The political complexity of setting individual quotas to satisfy Iran and Iraq could prove insurmountable, for instance. Energy Security Analysis Inc., Washington, advised clients Monday that there was &quot;less than a 50-50 probability&quot; that OPEC will establish a meaningful production cutting agreement at next month's meeting.    &quot;There was a lot of momentum toward an Iraq-Iran agreement,&quot; acknowledged Edward N. Krapels, the president of Energy Security Analysis. &quot;But that has to be fixed in a non-oil arena, and that is going to take time.&quot;    Analysts and traders agreed that any failure by OPEC to build on the progress of the Madrid meetings will devastate the oil market, practically ensuring that West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S., will decline below $10 a barrel from the current level of above $13. But analysts are divided over the short-term course of prices.    &quot;It should be trading down strongly over the next few days,&quot; said Mr. Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Rumors were widespread that Saudi Arabia would flood the market anew to punish Iran and Iraq into an agreement on each other's production quotas.    But Sun's Mr. Wilkinson said of the latest price plunge, &quot;By midweek or so, we ought to be out of this.&quot;    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold led precious metals prices lower, influenced in part by a sharp drop in the crude oil market. December gold declined $2.70 an ounce to $408.80. December silver was three cents an ounce lower at $6.2550. January platinum was off 70 cents an ounce to $527.20. Analysts said gold fell less than expected in the face of declining oil prices and a stronger dollar. Gold mining companies and buyers of gold are conflicting forces in the physical market, which is keeping prices fluctuating in a range of $395 to $410 an ounce, said Jeffrey Nichols, presiden of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc., a New York consulting company. &quot;The rally in gold in recent weeks was frustrated by mining companies, which have become aggressive sellers at around $410,&quot; said Mr. Nichols. &quot;On the other hand, demand has been strong from the Far East, from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. These interests are continuing to buy gold, with a seemingly insatiable appetite, and are providing strong support at around the $395 level,&quot; he said. The physical demand is also a supporting factor in a tug of war between the futures and the physical market for gold, and is blunting the depressing effect of selling by technically oriented speculators, particularly commodity funds, which are being heavily swayed by the disinflationary factors, Mr. Nichols said. Ian MacDonald, vice president of Credit Suisse, New York, said &quot;as the price gets down close to that magic $400, it seems to be attracting increased buying interest.&quot;    COPPER: Futures prices fell after trading at a record high $1.4650 Friday. The spot October contract barely traded and settled with a loss of 3.85 cents a pound at $1.4140. December copper fell three cents to $1.3325. &quot;I wouldn't say the major correction that's been expected since the price began to rally back in August has begun to take place,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;We'll have to see how the market acts in the next few days.&quot; He noted that prices initially were higher in reaction to a decline of 7,900 tons, to 80,000 tons, last week in copper inventories in warehouses of the London Metal Exchange. Then prices began to ease and in the last 15 minutes weakened significantly, he said. More significant, Mr. O'Neill added, was that the premium existing for October over December in futures has narrowed by a total of 1.60 cents in the past two sessions to 8.15 cents. The premium paid for the spot contract over other months is an indication of tightness of copper supplies. If it is narrowing, he said, it might indicate an easing in the supply situation, but it is still too early to tell. There was little change in the strong fundamental picture for copper. In fact, there were sketchy reports of production problems in Chile, he said. &quot;There are no details, according to news wire services, but the reports said the problems weren't associated with Gen. Pinochet or labor unrest,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices fell amid news of weekend rain and forecasts for further precipitation this week in Brazil and Argentina. Prices fell largely because the rains are occurring during South America's planting season and provide the crops with necessary soil moisture. Over the weekend, the two countries received as much as an inch of rain with 80% coverage mostly in southern regions of Brazil and 40% coverage in Argentine soybean areas, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Big selling by commission houses during early trading also helped drive prices downward, said Mr. Lespinasse. Late in the day, wheat futures prices rose on news that China made an offer for 400,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. Soybean prices rose slightly because of the rally in wheat, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
