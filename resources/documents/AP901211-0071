An expert panel said that family planning programs based on thepill do not need to be changed.   The agency reported on studies in eight developing and threeindustrialized countries that explored whether using the pillincreases the risk of cancer.   Experts from 11 countries met privately at WHO headquarters inGeneva to review the studies and other evidence, according to astatement issued by the agency.   Their findings included:   -Most studies suggest no general link between the pill andcervical or breast cancer. More research is needed because somestudies have found connections between long-term oral contraceptiveuse and the risk of either cancer among some groups of women. Butthe link could also be due to better disease detection or specialcharacteristics of women using the pill.   -Oral contraceptives increase the risk of benign liver tumors,but this is a very rare complication.   -The pill can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, cancer of theinner-lining of the uterus and benign breast diseases.   The general conclusion was that ``evidence about the associationbetween oral contraceptives and various types of tumors does notindicate there is any need for a change in policy in prescribingthe contraceptive pill,'' said Dr. Olof Meirik, an official inWHO's human reproduction program.   More than 60 million women are believed to use the pillworldwide, nearly two-thirds of them in developing countries, WHOsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
