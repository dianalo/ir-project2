<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0068 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computer model that can calculate absorbances for atomic absorptionspectrometry involving multi-isotopic elements is presented. The validityof the model calculations is verified by close matching of calculatedabsorbances with independently measured experimental absorbances aimedto determine isotope abundances of Li. The model is able to reveal behaviorof atomic absorption experimental systems which are difficult to observedirectly unless the experiments are performed with extreme care. Thesignificance of the dependence of isotope shifts and hyperfine and finestructure separations of spectral lines on the sensitivity of isotopeabundance determinations using flame atomic absorption spectrometry aredemonstrated. Further, the effects of concentrations of all isotopesand the flame parameters (line broadening parameter and collisional shiftof absorption lines) on the ability to discriminate among isotopes fora given experimental system are shown. For four selected elements (Ga,Cu, Pb and Hg), with different hyperfine structures, isotope shifts andnumber of isotopes, the optimum experimental conditions and the strategiesto be used for isotope abundance determinations using flame atomic absorptionspectrometry are delineated. For the four selected elements, the experimentalconditions (the elemental concentrations and the type of the flame absorptioncell) which do not introduce errors into analyses are presented. Forthe four elements referred to above, the magnitude of analytical errorand the maximum absorbance that do not introduce error into analysisare also determined for several analyte isotopic compositions, elementalconcentrations and different experimental conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
