This program emphasizes the medical applicationsof nuclear technology, particularly the development of radiopharmaceuticalsand instrumentation for imaging and other diagnostic and research procedures.Research efforts should be directed to developing improved methods forradioisotope production, instrumentation, radiopharmaceutical synthesis,and clinical feasibility studies.Radiopharmaceutical research seeks to develop new radiopharmaceuticals(sometimes called ``radioactive tracers'') and conducts early (preclinical)biomedical studies on new compounds. While studies of brain and heart metabolismconstitute the largest class of activities, the program also investigatesradiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy involving other organs.Clinical feasibility research includes in vivo testing of new radiopharmaceuticalsin animals and, in selected cases, humans. Researchers funded through theprogram evaluate methods for studying, diagnosing, and treating diseasessuch as cardiopulmonary disease, mental disorders, cancers, other tumors,and metabolic disorders. Particle beam and heavy ion therapy research,partly radiopharmaceutical and partly clinical feasibility studies, isconducted to find ways to treat inoperable disorders in humans. Instrumentation research focuses primarily on advanced radiation detectors,improved resolution of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and other imagingtechniques, and innovative applications of energy related technologiesfor noninvasively ascertaining the functioning and condition of internalorgans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>To permit timely consideration for award in Fiscal Year1989, applications submitted in response to this Notice should be receivedby the DOE, Division of Acquisition and Assistance Management by January8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Completed applications should be forwarded to: U.S. Departmentof Energy, Office of Energy Research, Division of Acquisition and AssistanceManagement, Room G-236, Washington, DC 20545, ATTN: Program Notice 88-5.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Paul Cho, Office of Healthand Environmental Research, ER-73, Washington, DC 20545, (301) 353-5897.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This notice relates to the NuclearMedicine Program, Human Health and Assessments Division, Office of Healthand Environmental Research. The goal of this program is to develop newand improved methods and radiopharmaceuticals for using nuclear scienceand technology in diagnosis, therapy and research. It is anticipated thatten to fifteen awards will be made at approximately $150,000 per year.Multiple year funding of awards is expected subject to the availabilityof future funds.Applications should be directed to state-of-the-art research that contributesto the following areas:1. The development of generator systems for short-lived daughter radionuclidesof use in medical diagnosis and studies of physiological processes. 2. Imaging Development for: (a) Positron-emitters (i) Development of better annihilation photon detectors (ii) Development of a compact, less expensive cyclotron for radiosotopeproduction (iii) Development of more efficient automated systems for radiopharmaceuticalsincorporating the short-lived positron-emitters (b) Single photon emitters:(i) Development of better instruments for SPECT imaging(ii) Development of improved detectors and collimator design (iii) Development of better reconstruction algorithms(c) Computer software development for:(i) Modeling of plasma kinetics and biodistribution of labeled monoclonalantibodies for radiation dose estimates prior to radioimmunotherapy(ii) Quantitation of physiological and abnormal function of specific organsfrom serial camera images(iii) Comparison of the efficacy of various parameters of organ function(iv) Improved methods for analyzing three-dimensional data generated bySPECT or PET3. Development and diagnostic applications of gamma-emitting radio-pharmaceuticalsfor:(a) Improved Tc-99m agents for organ imaging(b) Better agents for imaging thrombi and atherosclerotic lesions (c) Development of receptor-binding agents for more selective localizationof various radionuclides in specific tissues or organs (d) Better methods for labeling blood cellular components for study incellular immunology(e) Better bifunctional chelates for Tc-99m and other radioactive elementsto conjugate monoclonal antibodies and other proteins (f) Improved characterization of the radiochemical and labeling propertiesof intermediate half-life gamma emitters such as Ru-97 and Pb-2034. The development of therapeutic applications of radionuclides, particlarlyfor radioimmunotherapy with labeled monoclonal antibodies. This researchinvolves the production of radionuclides with optimum physical and chemicalproperties and their incorporation into radiopharmaceuticals, animal testing,and computer modeling for radiation dose estimates.5. Design and development of an alternative (non-reactor) source of epithermalneutrons for use in boron neutron capture therapy. 6. Development of boronated compounds with selectivity for tumor cellsand rapid blood clearance to ascertain clinical feasibility of boron neutroncapture therapy.In addition, information regarding preparation and submission of applications,eligibility, limitations, evaluation and selection process, and other policiesand procedures are contained in the OER Special Research Grant ApplicationKit and guide.
