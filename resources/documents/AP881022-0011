Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department,employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker oremployee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph examfor voice stress analysis.   The regulations, which take effect Dec. 27, implementlegislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan lastJune outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detectortests.   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimatedthat 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90percent of them by private employers.   Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put upposters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions andoutlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detectortest.   Fred Alvarez, assistant labor secretary for employmentstandards, said the posters will be mailed out in the next three orfour weeks.   In addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test inviolation of the new law can sue employers in federal and statecourts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion andany payment of lost wages and benefits.   Exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal,state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged innational security, intelligence or top secret activities.   Also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armoredcar, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protectoperations affecting health and safety, national security or money.   Pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributingor dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicantsto submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people whowould have direct access to the drugs.   Polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigatespecific incidents of theft, embezzlement or sabotage, but not apersistent problem, such as recurring inventory shortages.   But any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under thoseconditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and astatement in advance telling them of their rights, including theright to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time.   The pre-test statement also must explain the specific incidentor activity being investigated and the basis for the employer'ssuspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it.   Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an examcannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against anemployee. The regulations also forbid disclosure of the testresults to anyone other than the employee without the employee'sconsent or a court order.</TEXT></DOC>
