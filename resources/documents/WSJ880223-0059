Both companies are based in Houston.    American Exploration, a buyer and developer of producing oil and gas reserves, said the purchase of the Kirby Exploration Co. of Texas and General Energy Corp. units' assets includes working interests in producing oil and gas properties, primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The sale also includes Kirby's royalty interests in several thousand wells in Texas, Oklahoma and several other states.    Kirby Exploration, formerly an oil and gas exploration and production concern, said the transaction signals its exit from the oil and gas business. The company now will focus on its transportation, towage of freight by barge, and Puerto Rico-based insurance writing businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
