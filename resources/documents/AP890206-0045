The arctic front that spilled out of Alaska last week remainedstalled over virtually the entire nation, forcing temperatures belownormal just about everywhere but Florida. Forecasters said relief isat least several days away.   In Arkansas, churches canceled Sunday services to spareworshipers the danger of traveling on icy roads. Public schoolsthroughout central and northern Texas, as well as at least two Texascolleges, canceled classes today for the same reason.   The weather has contributed to at least 40 deaths in the lower 48states since the air spread from Alaska on Tuesday.   Among the latest victims were three people killed Sunday night onicy roads in Kentucky and a man who froze to death beneath a freewayoverpass in Salt Lake City earlier in the day.   Accidents on slick roads also were blamed for four deaths inLouisiana, including two people who died when an 18-wheel truck spunout of control on an icy bridge just east of Monroe and rammed theirvehicles.   In addition, four teen-agers competing in a Wisconsin ice-fishingderby were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday after theyleft propane heaters running overnight in a wooden shanty. Theovernight temperature near frozen Harpt Lake was about 16 below zero.   A Texas boy died at a Grand Junction, Colo., hospital late Sundayafter being trapped beneath an avalanche earlier in the day. Twoother boys were buried but managed to escape from the snowslide atMount Crested Butte in the central Rockies.   At 2 a.m. EST today, the nation's low was minus 44 degrees atCraig, Colo. In California, Sacramento's 29 degrees early todaybroke a 90-year-old record for the date and San Francisco's 35degrees shattered a 100-year-old record. Elsewhere, it was 1 degreein Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul, 5 in St. Louis, 6 inAlbuquerque, N.M. and 8 in Salt Lake City.   On Sunday, low temperature records were reached in at least 26cities, from the Pacific to the Plains.   In Denver, it was 24 below zero, the city's coldest temperaturein 26 years. At 1 p.m., the thermometer crept to 1 degree, breakinga 70-hour streak of subzero cold. The nation's low Sunday was 46below zero at Wisdom, Mont.   It was minus 21 at South Lake Tahoe, Calif., and parts of the SanFrancisco Bay area remained coated in snow, astonishing longtimeresidents.   ``You could only find a scene like this on a postcard,'' saidTimothy Waters, a 77-year-old ranch resident at the Point ReyesNational Seashore just north of the Golden Gate. ``It's justextraordinarily beautiful. Our family can't remember snow like thisin 40 years.''   Persistent snow in Chicago forced the temporary closure of MidwayAirport and the closure of two runways at O'Hare InternationalAirport, causing 40 flight cancellations and numerous delays.   ``It just won't stop,'' complained Kirsten Svare, a spokeswomanfor Chicago's Department of Streets and Sanitation. ``It just keepscoming.''   Cool, drizzly weather in New Orleans didn't stop 11 scheduledMardi Gras parades, but it did contribute to sales of hot drinks inBourbon Street bars.   ``Thank God it did get a little bit colder,'' said Toni Reyes,manager of the Seaport Bar. ``As soon as it rained, it pushedeveryone inside.''   Freezing rain was reported early today across the Easternseaboard from Delaware to Virginia, and south and west across Ohio,Kentucky, Tennessee, northern Mississippi and into the Texas GulfCoast and central Texas.   In Decatur, Texas, 60 miles northwest of Dallas, members of theBluebonnet Nudist Park couldn't keep their clothes off Sunday astemperatures were in the teens and low 20s.   ``Unfortunately, we nudists have to put it on hold for a fewdays,'' said manager Arthur Moss. ``As nudists, we're generally asensible lot.''   Nudists and sensible conformists will be bundling up for at leastthe next few days, according to Harry Gordon of the National WeatherService's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.   However, he added, storms brewing in the Southwest could spellrelief of sorts for the rest of the country later in the week.   If the storms begin to push north and east, they could bring moreseasonable temperatures to the middle of the country, Gordon said,but they also would bring more snow or rain.   As Karl Williams of the weather service in Chicago said: ``Whoknows? ... When it snows it snows, and when it doesn't, it doesn't.''</TEXT></DOC>
