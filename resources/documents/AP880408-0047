Even sound Grade A eggs, which are screened for defects andcleansed outside with chemical disinfectant, appear to beimplicated in the sickening of hundreds of people in recent years,the researcher said Thursday.   Previous egg-related salmonella food poisoning has been limitedto eggs that were cracked, dirty or in some other way defective ormishandled, said Dr. Michael E. St. Louis of the national Centersfor Disease Control in Atlanta.   St. Louis said in a telephone interview, though, that hisfindings now implicate Grade A eggs _ the most widely sold egg inwhole shell form. He said, however, that fully cooked eggs appearto present no danger.   ``In all of the outbreaks we investigated, people ate the eggsraw or undercooked,'' St. Louis said. ``Consumers don't need tostop eating eggs, but if they wish to avoid salmonella infections,they need to cook the eggs.''   Cathy McCharen, a spokeswoman for the egg industry-funded EggNutrition Center in Washington, D.C., said ``We're doing everythingpossible to correct and identify any problems.''   St. Louis and his colleagues began their investigation afterlearning of a sixfold increase in the number of infections causedby the bacteria salmonella enteritidis in Northeastern states from1976 to 1986.   The researchers found that in the nine affected states fromJanuary 1985 to May 1987, 65 food-borne outbreaks of salmonellaenteritidis occurred and were associated with 2,119 food-poisoningcases and 11 deaths.   In 35 outbreaks, the food bearing the infection could beidentified, the researchers said. Twenty-seven of those 35outbreaks ``were caused by Grade A shell eggs or food thatcontained such eggs,'' the researchers added.   A separate survey of records concerning all U.S. salmonellaoutbreaks from 1973 to 1984 revealed that ``egg-containing foodswere disproportionately associated with salmonella enteritidisinfections both in the Northeast and in the rest of the UnitedStates,'' the researchers said.   They reported their findings in today's Journal of the AmericanMedical Association.   Dr. Robert C. Baker, a food science professor at CornellUniversity in Ithaca, N.Y., said, however, that he believes thedanger may be over and that the rash of outbreaks may have run itscourse.   Baker, a long-time researcher into egg safety, said in atelephone interview Wednesday that lab tests at 53 New York Statefarms last year failed to turn up any trace of salmonellaenteritidis contamination.   ``We don't think the problem is going away,'' St. Louiscountered. ``Outbreaks continue to occur. ... It's continuing torise in the Northeast, and it's actually spreading out of theNortheast.''   Ms. McCharen added in a telephone interview Wednesday that CDCresearchers established a statistical link between some _ not all _Northeastern salmonella outbreaks and eggs, and ``what they don'tknow is why.''   St. Louis agreed, saying one possible explanation is thatsalmonella infection may contaminate the ovaries of chickens andinfect yolks before shells are formed.   But he emphasized, ``We think the frequency of eggs beingcontaminated with salmonella is very low.''   He said about one-third of all chicken and turkey sold in storesis salmonella-contaminated, and slightly less than a third of theground beef, but those infections are destroyed by cooking.   In contrast, eggs often are eaten raw _ in hollandaise sauces,Caesar salad dressings, homemade egg nog and ice cream, theresearchers said.   Where eggs are concerned, sufficient cooking is difficult todetermine, but a previous study has suggested boiling for at leastseven minutes, poaching for five minutes and frying on each sidefor at least three minutes, the study said.   The Northeastern states included in the study were Connecticut,Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.</TEXT></DOC>
