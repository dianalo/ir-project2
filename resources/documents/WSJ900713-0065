We may well be arriving at a moment ofreckoning in this country's attitudes toward theenvironmentalists. The leading evidence for this is theattitude of the U.S. President.   At his press conference after the summit ended Wednesday,the last question Mr. Bush got was, &quot;Mr. President, theenvironmental groups that were very much in evidence heredon't seem too happy with the results of the summit.&quot; Mr.Bush replied: &quot;Hey, they haven't seemed happy with me for along time. And I'm not too happy with them. But what's thequestion?&quot;   &quot;Well, sir, the question is, they're calling yourforestation initiative a fig leaf to cover up your inactionon the environment.&quot;   President Bush: &quot;Oh, I can't -- look, come on, I'm notgoing to respond to those groups that have been attacking usevery time we turn around. I have to be careful because therewere some reasonable people involved. But on theenvironmental extreme, they don't want this country to grow.They don't want to look down the road at the humanconsequence of men and women thrown out of work and familiesput into a whole new state of anxiety. And I as Presidenthave to be concerned about that, as well as being a goodcustodian, a good steward for the environment. We cannotgovern by listening to the loudest voice on the extreme of anenvironmental movement. I did not rely heavily on them forsupport in getting elected President of the United States,and I'm not going to be persuaded that I can get some browniepoint by appealing to one of these groups.   &quot;And the attacks that they made on some of my summitpartners, I resent too. . . . But I had a little cloakroomconversation with some of the participants and I think mostof them are disinclined to change policies in their countriesthat they think are sound because of some of the statementsthat I saw and perhaps some that you were referring to here.   &quot;We'll listen and keep trying to do better, but I amdetermined that we can find a sound environmental path andstill have some concern for the working man and the workingwoman in this country. And that really is what it boils downto when you talk about no growth. I'm not going to talk aboutno growth for the United States because I feel a deep concernabout the human equation as well as the environment.&quot;   We suspect that Mr. Bush is not the only person who isbeginning to feel that his good-faith efforts onenvironmental matters will never satisfy movement activistswhose agenda is increasingly taking on the trappings ofreligious fanaticism. Indeed, a Journal story this week notedthat charitable giving to environmental groups remains low.One reason, an environmentalist suggested, is the belief&quot;that if you donate to environmental groups, they will helpthe spotted owl and hurt people.&quot; Which of course they will,as is now evident to the University of Arizona, the MaxPlanck Institute and the Vatican Observatory.   This consortium is attempting to erect a set of telescopeson a mountain outside Tucson but the project is bogged downin a lawsuit over the &quot;endangered&quot; red squirrel. Among theplaintiffs: the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, the NationalAudubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation.Scientists from Max Planck and the Vatican are now sayingthey may abandon the project. American science must recedeand withdraw before this movement.   The biggest environmental project of our time remains theClean Air Bill. We've long felt that the groups may haveoverplayed their hand on this legislation. Now, in asoon-to-be-published economic analysis of the bill in theJournal of Economic Perspectives, a leading environmentalistexpresses serious concerns about the bill's effects.   &quot;If these estimates are even close to correct,&quot; writesPaul R. Portney, the vice president of Resources for theFuture, &quot;Congress and the President are about to shake handson a landmark piece of environmental law for which costs mayexceed benefits by a considerable margin. To repeat, thecosts of the proposed new air quality controls have beenlittle analyzed and even the preliminary results have notbeen accessible to the public. If it were more widelyappreciated that, when fully implemented, the Clean Airamendments may cost each U.S. household $300-$400 per year,perhaps opposition would be sharper.&quot;   As with taxes, Americans have always been willing to payfor programs that they could identify as producing tangiblebenefits. The effort to protect nature from unnecessarydegradation has been such a commitment. It appears to us,however, that in recent years the environmental movement hasbegun to feel it is not bound by the normal constraints ofpolitical life, such as those mentioned by President Bush inthe remarks above. A voice that says the President is&quot;killing the world&quot; is the familiar voice of politicalextremism.</TEXT></DOC>
