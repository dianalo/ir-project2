However, epidemiologicaldata do not exactly confirm this optimistic view, as acute respiratorydiseases are among the leading causes of death in Europe. When morbiditystatistics - which are usually less reliable - are considered, acuterespiratory infections in Europe take the lead among all communicablediseases. For example, each year 15% of the population in Spain and 30%of the population in the United Kingdom have a recorded acute respiratorydisease. Several environmental risk factors of acute respiratory diseaseshave been recorded, the main ones being indoor and outdoor air pollution,overcrowding in dwellings and public transport, and poor indoor climate.Improvement of the indoor climate of dwellings is recognized as an efficientmeans of secondary prevention of acute respiratory infection, especiallyin risk groups such as pre-school children and the elderly. Consideringthe large percentage of the aged in many European countries living indwellings insufficiently heated or ventilated, or not heated at all,and considering the economic difficulties which complicate the quickimprovement of this situation, it was considered useful to review thehealth impact of low indoor temperature and to recommend some lower limitsto protect human health, especially of the very young and the elderly.</TEXT></DOC>
