The rehearing was scheduled for Sept. 9. A three-judge panel of the court heard arguments Monday, but no ruling was issued.    Macmillan proposed a major restructuring in response to a takeover bid launched in May by Robert M. Bass Group Inc. Last month, a Delaware chancery court issued a preliminary injunction, barring Macmillan from implementing its plan. Another bidder, Maxwell Communication Corp., has since made another offer for the company, but Macmillan said it would aggressively pursue its restructuring plan.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Macmillan shares fell $1.625 to $82. </TEXT></DOC>
