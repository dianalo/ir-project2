(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state banned the sale or manufactureof eight handguns and at least 100 others also will be prohibitedbecause their manufacturers did not submit them for approval,officials said.   The Maryland Handgun Roster Board, a nine-member panel, has beenworking for about a year to compile a list of handguns that meetthe criteria of a law passed last year aimed at banning so-calledSaturday Night Specials _ the cheap, small, low-caliber weaponspopular among criminals.   ``Some people said this law would ban all guns in the state ofMaryland, but that has not occurred,'' State Police chief ElmerTippett said Monday. ``We banned some today and we approved a largenumber.''   Weapons makers were asked to submit their guns for the board'sapproval. Tippett, who headed the panel, estimated that at least100 guns were not considered because manufacturers failed to submitthem.   ``I believe Maryland will be a safer place to live because wehave taken the time to consider these guns and their use,'' Gov.William Donald Schaefer said.   The board judged the quality of manufacture, concealability,weight, size, safety features and intended use. The ban goes intoeffect Jan. 1, though manufacturers who did not submit their gunsto the board may do so at a later date. The list of legal gunsincludes more than 600 weapons.   ``Despite the National Rifle Assocation's cries of wolf, we canall clearly see that law-abiding citizens in Maryland will still beable to purchase legitimate handguns,'' said Sarah Brady, wife offormer White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot andseverely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against formerPresident Reagan.   Mrs. Brady is chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., a nationalgroup that lobbied for passage of the state law.   Rafael Fiol, chairman of the state National Rifle Association,said he disapproved of the board's work.   ``I don't think there should be any restriction on law-abidingcitizens owning guns,'' he said.   Manufacturers who violate the law can be fined up to $10,000 pergun and dealers who sell banned guns could be fined up to $2,500per gun sold and could lose their license.   Among the 100 or more weapons banned because their makers didnot submit them were three of the five guns considered the mostpopular by criminals, according to statistics from the federalBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   The three guns are the MP-25, a .25-caliber semi-automaticpistol made by Raven Arms in California, the J22, a semi-automaticpistol manufactured by Jennings Firearms of California, and theTEC-9, a 9mm assault pistol made by the Florida manufacturerIntratec.   The eight handguns considered and banned by the roster boardincluded The American Derringer Corp.'s Model 1 .44 Magnum andModel 11 .38 Special; the Lorcin .25 caliber semi-automatic modelL-25; Seecamp's LWS .32 and .25, Precision Small Parts PSP-25 andFreedom Arms' .22 Long Rifle Mini Revolver and .22 Magnum MiniRevolver.</TEXT></DOC>
