GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias's winning of the Nobel Peace Prize gives his Central America peace plan enhanced credibility and could make it more difficult for the U.S. or Nicaragua to undercut the pact.    Mr. Arias built his reputation as a peace-maker by criticizing both Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels who are fighting them. But his neutralism has always caused problems for the Reagan administration.    Early this year, when Mr. Arias was devising the peace plan, U.S. officials told him he wasn't focusing enough on the details of how to negotiate a cease-fire. Mr. Arias replied that he didn't know much about military matters. &quot;He's always got to show that he's the great neutral who knows nothing about the military,&quot; commented an annoyed Reagan administration official involved in Central America policy.    The prestigious international prize has strengthened Mr. Arias's independence. If regional peace efforts falter, he will play an influential role in shaping world opinion concerning which side is at fault. In turn, he could influence decisions by the U.S. Congress, where support for the Contras usually is decided by a small group of swing voters.    &quot;People deeply committed for or against the Contras aren't likely to have their minds changed by this (the prize),&quot; said Rep. Matthew McHugh (D., N.Y.), a member of the foreign operations subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. &quot;But there is a small group that makes the difference . . . They tend to vote on the basis of what the political climate is when the vote comes up. And to the extent that the prize enhances the stature of Arias and the plan, it could influence them.&quot;    President Reagan yesterday congratulated the Costa Rican president for winning the prize. But Contra supporters were quick to point out that Mr. Arias's peace prize was awarded before peace has come to Central America.    The peace plan calls for a cessation of hostilities in the region, amnesty for at least some combatants, democratic reforms and an end to outside aid to insurgents such as the Contras -- all by Nov. 7.    Despite the plan, the White House is pushing for more Contra aid, arguing that without military pressure the Sandinista government will have little incentive to pursue peace or internal reforms. But Mr. Arias believes that U.S. military support for the Contras has given the Sandinistas an excuse to &quot;abolish individual freedoms, to abolish pluralism, to make of Nicaragua a more dictatorial society.&quot;    Mr. Arias's new status as international statesman is a double-edged sword that, he says, can be turned against the Sandinistas as well as Washington. On a visit here last month, he pledged to consider &quot;dramatic sanctions&quot; -- mostly economic rather than military -- against any Central American nation that violates the pact.    Mr. Arias's emergence as a major player in the peace process highlights the extent to which the Reagan administration has lost control over its own Central America policy. It has been reduced to grudgingly accepting the peace plan it doesn't like, and hoping that Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega will commit a blunder that will prompt Mr. Arias and others to point the finger of blame at Managua.    The White House's troubles began last summer when it entered into a bipartisan peace effort with House Speaker Jim Wright (D., Texas). The White House billed the Reagan-Wright plan as an alternative to continuing bloodshed, but opponents depicted it as an attempt to soften up Congress for renewed Contra aid.    However, spurred by the U.S. action, the five Central America presidents several days later agreed on a version of Mr. Arias's plan. The administration had little choice but to go along with the homegrown effort, even though officials believe it doesn't sufficiently protect U.S. interests.    &quot;It's not a comfortable position the president is in, and it's made ever so slightly more uncomfortable by the peace prize,&quot; said Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.). </TEXT></DOC>
