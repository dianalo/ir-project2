The McGraw-Hill Inc. unit is about to come out with two books about the stock market, both of which were in the works long before last week's crash. &quot;There's no question&quot; both will get sales boosts from the tumult, Mr. Sabin says. &quot;We can capitalize on the fundamental insecurity that's out there.&quot;    Indeed, while the financial community is mourning the loss of a fortune, the publishing community is dreaming of a fortune to be made. Book publishers are planning splashy promotions for just about any book that has anything to do with the stock market. They're reissuing old standards about the financial markets, and searching for new ones.    &quot;It's a little unfortunate,&quot; says Charles Hayward, publisher of Simon andamp; Schuster Inc.'s trade book division, of the crash. &quot;But I guess (we'll) make hay while the sun shines.&quot;    The book publishers' almost gleeful pursuit of Wall Street tomes contrasts with the approach taken so far by Hollywood's filmmakers and TV screenwriters: They have steered clear of the crash, mindful perhaps that the public doesn't want to have its nose rubbed in its own misfortune. News Corp.'s 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. says it doesn't plan to change its marketing campaign for Oliver Stone's soon-to-be-released film, &quot;Wall Street,&quot; which centers on insider trading and takes place in 1984 and 1985. The three television networks say that no Wall Street movies or series are in development.    And feature filmmakers see no point in making a film about a crash which, by the time the movie comes out in a year, could be &quot;a bad, distant memory,&quot; says producer Lawrence Gordon, whose films include &quot;48 Hours&quot; and &quot;Predator.&quot; &quot;This is the kind of thing people want to forget about. If you try to remind people of it in a movie, I think you'll have a flop.&quot;    Perhaps for that reason, publishers are concentrating on nonfiction books and investment guides, rather than novels. Lynn Nesbit, a prominent literary agent who heads up the literary department at International Creative Management, says her client Tom Wolfe has already been asked to write a book describing a day-in-the-life-type of book about the Oct. 19 crash; he turned the offer down.    Steven Axelrod, another New York literary agent, is meeting next week with an investment newsletter writer who has proposed a guide to investing in the stock market. Although the writer proposed the book and set up the meeting before the crash, &quot;I think he will be a much hotter property right now,&quot; Mr. Axelrod says.    Publishers also are poring over their book lists to see what titles they can market using a crash angle. McGraw-Hill, for example, will release next month a new edition of the 53-year-old economics classic, &quot;Security Analysis,&quot; by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. After last week's market plunge, executives at the publishing firm decided to scrap the introductory advertisement they had planned, which said simply, &quot;For over 50 years, Security Analysis has been the investment bible.&quot; The new ad's headline: &quot;After October 19, the last thing you need is another get-rich-quick scheme. Why not let Graham and Dodd guide you through the peaks and valleys of an uncertain market?&quot;    &quot;It sounds like a terrible thing to say, but we're benefiting from the market developments,&quot; says Alison Spalding, marketing manager for McGraw-Hill's business-books division. Another book the publisher expects to benefit is &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad,&quot; by William J. O'Neil, chairman of Investor's Daily, a business newspaper based in Los Angeles. Promotion for the book, slated for a January release, stresses its importance since the Oct. 19 stock-market plunge. &quot;We intend to push the hell out of this book,&quot; Mr. Sabin says. &quot;Clearly, you'll tie in the features of the book that have to do with the current times. It would be crazy not to do it.&quot;    Meanwhile, Simon andamp; Schuster, a unit of Gulf andamp; Western Inc., is putting a new marketing push behind its &quot;The Great Depression of 1990,&quot; by Ravi Batra. Sales of the book, already a bestseller, surged after the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19; at Walden Books, the nation's largest bookstore chain, sales climbed to almost 5,900 last week from 3,400 a week earlier.    To take advantage of that surge, Simon andamp; Schuster designed a new ad campaign. The new headline: &quot; 'Brilliantly plausible . . . horrendously disturbing . . .' And starting to come true.&quot;    &quot;Last week, we went out and solicited orders for almost 90,000 copies of Batra's book,&quot; Mr. Hayward says. &quot;We've now done 14 printings totaling 439,000 books -- 125,000 of those in two printings last week. It's really spectacular.&quot;    Simon andamp; Schuster is also pushing &quot;The Only Other Investment Guide You'll Ever Need,&quot; a recent release by financial writer Andrew Tobias, in a revamped marketing effort. The book, published earlier this month, has already gone into a small second printing, and Simon andamp; Schuster executives say the continuing stock-market turmoil makes its prospects alluring.    The publisher has also targeted several other of its financial books for an infusion of marketing muscle. &quot;Blood in the Streets,&quot; by James Dale Davidson and Sir William Rees-Mogg, had only a modest initial printing in June but in the past two weeks has gone back to print twice. &quot;Money Dynamics for the 1990s,&quot; a financial planning guide by Venita VanCaspel, scheduled to appear in March, may be updated to include references to the crash.    And the publisher hopes William Greider's &quot;Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country,&quot; due out in January, will get extra attention because of the crash. &quot;It creates a news handle,&quot; Mr. Hayward says.    At Bantam Books, Robert H. Waterman Jr.'s latest book, &quot;The Renewal Factor,&quot; is also getting a boost from the crash. The book is already a bestseller, but Bantam is using the market's volatility to get Mr. Waterman more publicity and speaking engagements.    &quot;Before, he was talking about how the best companies get and keep the competitive edge,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;Now, we're shifting to how companies and their employees can cope with an unstable stock market. Although his book isn't per se about the stock market, he's focusing on that to meet with the curiosity of the press.&quot;    Random House Inc., meanwhile, plans to beef up its advertising for &quot;Beyond Our Means,&quot; by Wall Street Journal Reporter Alfred L. Malabre Jr., and will come out with a revised edition in paperback in March, says Carolyn Reidy, associate publisher of the Random House and Vintage Books imprints. She also expects two other books to benefit from the tumultuous market: &quot;On Borrowed Time,&quot; a look at economic policy by Benjamin Friedman, and &quot;Smart Money,&quot; by Ken and Daria Dolan. The latter, planned for an April release, will be revised to reflect the stock-market crash, she says.    Meanwhile, new book ideas about the crash are on just about everybody's lips in publishing circles. But most major publishers interviewed say they don't expect to come up with any instant crash books, the way the market was flooded with Ollie North books over the summer.    &quot;To be honest with you, I think it's wrong to have a lot of quick books just on last week,&quot; says Ms. Nesbit, the literary agent. &quot;In many cases, quick books aren't as valuable or as financially remunerative as they should be.&quot;    &quot;In our business, a month is the minimum time you can get a book out,&quot; adds Simon andamp; Shuste's Mr. Haywar &quot;Who knows where we're going to be a month from now?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
