The infant, Itai Hamtzani, 19 months, was shot in the head anddied at Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv, hospital officials said.   The army said the soldiers opened fire when the father, DanielHamtzani, 30, stopped his car Tuesday night and shot into a groveof trees at an army patrol.   The father was shot in the chest and slightly wounded, and asecond son, Ordan, 4, was slightly wounded, the army said.

A military spokesman said the army was checking the reports.   Graffiti was sprayed across walls in the occupied lands callingfor the intefadeh, or uprising, to continue.   ``Children of the intefadeh _ their faces are furious, theirgames are stones,'' said one slogan signed by the uprising'sPLO-backed Unified Leadership in Gaza City.   The incident involving the Jewish settler occurred whileHamtzani was traveling to his home in the settlement of Ariel, anarmy announcement said.   Israel Radio said Hamtzani noticed a light in a grove of treesand mistook the soldiers for Palestinians lighting a firebomb tothrow at his car.   Hamtzani backed up and fired into the trees, the radio said. Itnoted that news reports earlier Tuesday had reported a firebombingnearby.   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among 1.7 million Palestiniansin the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The settlers have complainedbitterly that the army has failed to protect them from stone andfirebomb attacks during the uprising, and many carry arms.   Also today, soldiers tore down two houses in Gaza Strip refugeecamps that belonged to men who admitted killing four Arabssuspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, the army said.
