The Foreign Ministry said ``all units of Soviet troops that stillremain in Afghanistan'' will lay down their arms on Jan. 1 and theSoviets also are ready to stop supplying weapons to the Kabulgovernment. Afghan President Najib on Friday committed his forces tothe truce.   ``The Soviet Union fully supports this peace move of the Afghanleadership,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for the truce in a Dec. 7address to the United Nations, but the United States rejected it.   On Friday, Alexander Bessmertnykh, a first deputy Soviet foreignminister, met with U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock to make a bid forWashington's support.   The official Tass news agency said Bessmertnykh also made thepitch to the ambassador from Pakistan, which with the help of theUnited States supplies arms to rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxistgovernment.   ``Hope is expressed in the Soviet Union that the Afghanopposition and all countries ... first of all the United States andPakistan, will choose peace and through concrete actions respond tothe peaceful intentions of the Republic of Afghanistan and theSoviet Union,'' the Foreign Ministry said in Saturday's statement.   The statement, carried by Tass, did not make clear how longSoviet troops would hold their fire if the rebels don't stopshooting. Najib, however, said Moslem insurgents will be given fourdays to accept the truce. If they refuse, government troops willstart shooting again, he said.   Afghanistan's first deputy defense minister, Lt. Gen. MohammadNabi Azimi, noted in a Tass interview Saturday that the rebels hadnot adhered to previous truces.   ``If the opposition does not agree to the cease-fire once again,the army will deal powerful strikes at extremists in several areasof the country after Jan. 5,'' Azimi warned.   A rebel spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan, dismissed the truce.   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to,'' saidMasood Khalili. ``And we won't stop because he asked us to.''   Khalili belongs to the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group whoseleader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, met in December with Soviet DeputyForeign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting Kabul's troops for10 years. In December 1979, Soviet troops marched into Afghanistanto bolster the Kabul government.   The Foreign Ministry said both sides should stop aiding theirallies in the war.   ``Addressing specifically the United States, the Soviet sideagain reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity todiscontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in Afghanistanfrom Jan. 1,'' the statement said.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has rejected the proposal,noting that the Soviets snubbed prior U.S. offers for mutualcessation of outside aid.   He said the rebels were justified in trying to seize territory asthe Soviets withdraw ``because the people of Afghanistan, broadlyspeaking, do not accept the fact that the puppet regime is entitledto hold certain areas of that country.''   A senior Western diplomat, explaining why the United States willnot go along with the aid cutoff, said the Soviets poured in a hugeamount of military supplies to Afghanistan in preparation for theNew Year's peace moves.   On May 15, the Soviet Union began withdrawing its estimated100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-brokered agreement.Half of the Soviet troops have left the country and the remaininghalf are to pull out by Feb. 15.   But Soviet officials say they have suspended their troopwithdrawal temporarily because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aidto the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
