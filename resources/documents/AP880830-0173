(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 8-foot alligator is a full day's work,Dale Dunaway reckons.   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thickhide at the tip of its tail. Then it's a slow and difficult cut tothe snout.   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin andgut a gator,'' Dunaway, who operates one of Florida's few alligatorprocessing facilities, said Tuesday. ``There's no way around it.It's hard work, you bet.''   At the Gator House in the remote southwest Florida grasslands,Dunaway and his relatives have sharpened their knives and readiedthe pots in anticipation of the first statewide gator hunt sincethe 37-year-old Dunaway was a boy spearing alligators at nearbyLake Trafford.   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, 238 license holderswill be stalking areas of the state where the gator population isextraordinarly high. The hunt, the first since 1962, is needed totrim the numbers of the once-threatened alligator, which hasrebounded strongly since strict anti-poaching measures wereinstituted in the early 1970s.   The estimated 1 million alligators in Florida is nearly doublethe 1975 population, said Allan Woodward, head of the alligatorresearch unit for the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.   With each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators, Dunaway isprepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant sinceit opened in 1986.   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,either skinning or hunting,'' he said. ``We're gonna be looking ata lot of dead gators.''   Some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use theequipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screenwire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans. A fewjunk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly.   But the novice trappers, randomly selected from 5,000applications, will watch their catch be pried apart.   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hidecovering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, whichsells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submergedin a brine solution for about a week.   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' saidDunaway. ``They got a powerful smell, and if you ever cut open thestomach you better start running.''   The meat _ which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghettisauce _ must be frozen within several hours after the alligator iskilled. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230pounds of meat.   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch likethat,'' said Dunaway's brother, Grant, 34.   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways anduncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from theirjobs to process the gators.   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a poundis break even.   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.   With state officials publicizing that a 10-foot gator could net$1,000 in meat and skin, Dale Dunaway wonders if greed rather thanadventure is motivating the new hunters.   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're goingto make money off this hunt,'' he said. ``They don't figure in thetime, expenses _ and don't forget the danger. I'd like to see somepeople's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.   ``But if they want to catch 'em, then we'll skin 'em. We'll justsay, `Stack 'em up.'''   He folded his knife in a triumphant clap.</TEXT></DOC>
