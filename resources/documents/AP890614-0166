Ryzhkov said Wednesday thatgovernment and other officials ``tarnished the party's prestige'' byproviding gasoline, vodka and transport for attackers who killedMeshki Turks in Soviet Uzbekistan.   An Interior Ministry official told Tass news agency that somevictims were tortured and their bodies were mutilated in the 10-daywave of ethnic violence. At least 90 people died. Most victims wereMeshki Turks, a minority of 300,000 people forcibly resettled fromtheir Soviet Georgia homeland by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.   Ryzhkov made his disclosure at a meeting with Communist Partyofficials in Andizhan, a regional center northeast of the FerganaValley where the arson, shootings and stabbings were committed.   Tass quoted the Soviet leader as promising the killers and otherattackers will be punished, but ``the communists who tarnished theparty's prestige, the good name of the Uzbek people, bear specialresponsibility.''   Ryzhkov did not name the officials or their titles. But he saidhe would like them to see poor conditions at a makeshift camp forrefugees who fled the unrest.   The weekly Moscow News warned overcrowding and poor sanitation inthe Fergana Valley camp could cause an outbreak of infectiousdisease.   Interior Ministry spokesman Boris Mikhailov told reportersTuesday that gangs of extremists, mostly ethnic Uzbeks, burned 548houses and torched 28 ``buildings of economic importance.''   Tass on Wednesday quoted an investigator as saying criminalsplanned the violence and targeted homes of Meshki Turks for arson.   ``The tragic events in the Fergana region were well planned andorganized,'' Lt. Gen. V.K. Pankin, an Interior Ministryinvestigator, told Tass. ``Houses which were destroyed were studiedcarefully long beforehand.''   He blamed criminals using nationalism as an excuse to createdisorder and destabilization.   ``Turks were just a pretext for the disturbances,'' Pankin said.Those responsible, he said, include youths belonging to unofficialorganizations, former police officers dismissed for corruption and alarge number of self-styled intellectuals.   Tass also quoted Lt. Gen. A. Anikiev, a political officer of theInterior Ministry, as saying:   ``There were brutal tortures of the aged and children, violenceagainst women and sadistic murders of innocent people of Turk, Uzbekand other nationalities. ... There was even mutilation of bodies.''   Officials said they began evacuating about 17,000 people from therefugee camp to Soviet Russia on Tuesday. But Moscow News reported15,000 people remain, a third of them children, living in deplorableconditions.   ``There is the threat of an epidemic. Turks have warned that ifeven a single child dies, they will not be responsible for theiractions,'' it said.   ``Food and wastes are in the water canals and shouts and criescan be heard everywhere,'' it said.   Ryzhkov said Tuesday a government commission will examine theMeshki Turks' request to return to Georgia.</TEXT></DOC>
