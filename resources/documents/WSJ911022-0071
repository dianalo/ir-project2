Seeking to contain what appeared to be a spreadingepidemic of credit-reporting errors, TRW said Friday it isdeleting all local-tax data in its files for Maine, NewHampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It said it is trying todetermine whether residents of those states were unfairlyturned down for loans or jobs because of credit-reporterrors.</LP><TEXT>   TRW's errors in New England have already touched offmayhem and personal-finance crises in several towns. Mostcases involve the same bizarre problem: credit reports thaterroneously show a lien on a consumer's property, on accountof unpaid local taxes.   As reported earlier, that error tainted the credit reportsthis year of all 1,400 taxpayers of the picturesque town ofNorwich, Vt. It turned out that a part-time worker for asubcontractor of TRW's, had come to the Norwich town officeto collect the names of delinquent Norwich taxpayers. But shelooked at the wrong list and wrote down the names of all1,400 residents who paid their taxes.   Last month TRW called the Norwich episode &quot;a very isolatedsituation.&quot; But last week the company said it had learned ofother errors in Woodstock, Vt., and believed a similar mix-upmay have occurred in other towns.   In response, TRW said it was firing the subcontractor,National Data Retrieval Inc. of Norcross, Ga., and deletinglocal-tax data in all four states where National Data didwork for TRW.   &quot;We did that as a safety precautionkind of like Johnson andamp;Johnson removing all their Tylenol,&quot; said John McGee, vicepresident of public affairs for TRW's Information Servicesdivision.   The case in Woodstock involved Dwight Cabot Camp, thefourth-generation owner of the Cabot funeral home. Two weeksago, he recalled, his local banker, reviewing a loanapplication for an addition to the funeral home, called himup and said, &quot;Dwight, golly, we got a little problem.&quot;   The problem: His TRW credit report showed a lien on hisproperty for unpaid local taxes. In fact, Mr. Camp said histaxes were fully paid. Soon afterward, a second Woodstockresident reported the identical problem to the town manager,Philip Swanson.   Mr. Swanson said he called TRW, was referred to fivedifferent numbers, and tried them all with no success. TRWeventually reached him last week. Asked why Mr. Swanson wouldhave had such difficulty reaching TRW, Mr. McGee said, &quot;Ijust don't know how to respond. It's certainly not the waywe'd like to work.&quot;   On Friday the Vermont attorney general, Jeffrey Amestoy,said he knows of TRW credit-report problems in at least threeother towns: Hartland, Hartford, and Sheffield.   In addition Nancy Husband, the treasurer of Windsor, Vt.,said Friday that two residents of her town recently told herthey had erroneous records of delinquent local taxes on theirTRW credit reports. In one case, a student preparing to studyabroad in Europe was turned down for a credit card because ofhis parents' bad credit report, Ms. Husband said.   Mr. Amestoy said Vermont plans to sue TRW for violatingthe state's consumerprotection law. Fourteen other states arealready suing the Cleveland aerospace and auto-parts giant,charging it with systematically putting data into the wrongconsumers' files and reinserting errors even after consumerscorrect them. TRW vigorously denies these charges.   The trouble in New England is turning into apublic-relations nightmare for TRW. Television and magazinereporters are flocking to Norwich -- at its most photogenicas the autumn leaves start to turn. This Wednesday KarenPorter, a quilt maker who serves as Norwich's clerk, isscheduled to testify at Senate hearings about proposedoverhauls of the credit-reporting industry. TRW dispatchedtwo senior consumer-affairs officials to Norwich last week tomeet with Ms. Porter.   TRW said that if it finds local-tax errors in the fourstates it's reviewing, it will notify the consumer and anyonethat examined the erroneous report. It said it will giveconsumers who suffered errors a corrected copy of theirreport and a coupon good for another free copy in the future.   Mr. McGee said that National Data also gatheredinformation for TRW about bankruptcies, foreclosures, andcourt judgments. But he said TRW isn't reviewing that databecause its spot-checks don't indicate any troubles with it.   In Norcross, Ga., an official of National Dataacknowledged the company had made errors for TRW and said itregretted them. The official, Richard Anderson III, vicepresident, said the woman who made the errors in Norwich alsogathered data in two or three other nearby towns, which hedidn't name.   Mr. Anderson said National Data also does work for TRW'stwo main rivals in the credit-reporting industry, EquifaxInc. and Trans Union Corp. Both companies said Friday theyaren't aware of any problem they've had with National Data.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE ROLE of a small subcontractor called National DataRetrieval Inc. of Norcross, Ga., was described in an Oct. 14article about errors in TRW Inc. credit reports. The companyis unrelated to National Data Corp. of Atlanta.   (WSJ Oct. 22, 1991)   911014-0079</TEXT></DOC>
