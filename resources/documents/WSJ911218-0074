Raymond J. Sims, vice president and treasurer, said thecompany settled the suit to &quot;avoid the risks and expenses ofa jury trial involving complex issues.&quot; He added that &quot;therehas been no finding that Raychem or any of its employeesengaged in any misconduct or violated any laws.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nonetheless, the settlement amount is rather substantial,and represents another blow to a company that has beenstruggling for many quarters. Raychem didn't say how thesettlement would affect earnings, but did say it isnegotiating with its insurers to determine how much of thepayment ultimately will be covered. Initially, Raychem willpay $8,250,000 of the propsed settlement and its insurerswill pay $11,250,000.   The settlement proposal still must be approved by a statecourt in San Francisco, where it was filed.   The lawsuit alleged that Raychem misled investors aboutits condition and its prospects throughout most of 1988 andinto early 1989. During that time, Raychem was in the midstof a lengthy and expensive research and development programthat continues to this day on a fiber-optics technology itconsiders a potential gold mine. The company suffered a big,unexpected profit dive in its second fiscal quarter endedDec. 31, 1988, and had a string of profit plunges thereafter.   To date, Raychem has poured hundreds of millions ofdollars into the fiber-optics research without much payoff.In its fiscal year ended June 30, it had a net loss of $23.4million, or 63 cents a share, on sales of $1.2 billion.However, it did earn $7.4 million, or 19 cents a commonshare, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Sales forthat period were $304 million.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Raychem closed at $32.50, down 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
