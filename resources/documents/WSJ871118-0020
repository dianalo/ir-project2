In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6913 West German marks, down 1.4% from 1.7145 marks late Monday, and at 135.58 Japanese yen, down 1.2% from 137.18 a day earlier. The British pound climbed 1.4% to $1.7645 from $1.7405.    The U.S. currency continued to fall early Wednesday in Tokyo, where it was quoted at 135.30 yen.    Traders said the dollar's decline yesterday resulted from an apparent lack of progress in the budget-cutting talks between Congress and the White House. President Reagan's optimistic remarks over the weekend about the talks fueled Monday's rally by the currency.    &quot;The market is chasing around the day-to-day news on the budget talks,&quot; Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank, New York, said.    Traders interpreted the absence of word on the budget talks during the day as bad news. &quot;If there was progress, they could've leaked it out,&quot; a dealer said.    The lack of news left market participants to focus on President Reagan's lashing out Monday at suggestions for a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit. Traders said his statements seemed to clash with his optimistic radio address Saturday, in which he said negotiators were close to an $80 billion, two-year agreement on cutting the deficit.    Negotiators in Washington must agree on how to reduce the fiscal 1988 deficit by at least $23 billion this week or automatic across-the-board spending cuts of that amount will be imposed under the Gramm-Rudman law Friday.    &quot;People were expecting a budget-reduction package above the Gramm-Rudman target, but that doesn't look likely now,&quot; Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Commercial Bank of Kuwait, New York, said.    &quot;If it doesn't happen, the dollar could drift lower,&quot; he said.    Many traders and analysts say progress toward substantial cuts in the U.S. budget deficit is necessary to halt the dollar's long decline. The deficit also has taken on a symbolic importance, traders say, that may be almost as great as its economic impact. An agreement this week to significantly reduce the deficit, they say, would go a long way toward restoring international confidence in Washington's ability to get the U.S. over its economic hurdles.    Some traders also were discouraged yesterday by debate in the Senate over a major housing bill.    &quot;That suggests that all this talk about cutting expenditures has to be taken with a grain of salt,&quot; one trader said. Late yesterday, the Senate killed the measure.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.60 an ounce to $464.90 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $465.05 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, Nov. 17, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
