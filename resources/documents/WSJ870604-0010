Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit in the U.S., could set back efforts to sell brands not involved in the incident. &quot;I've lost a lot of sleep over the past two nights worrying about its impact,&quot; said one executive.    &quot;It's a very disappointing development,&quot; a U.S. trade official here said, &quot;because U.S. cigarettes were becoming one of our few success stories. The Japanese are very neurotic about things like quality. This could have a deep effect.&quot; Reynolds has launched a public relations campaign to soothe Japanese concerns over the company's Winston Lights, the brand that was tainted.    Tokyo yielded only last year to U.S. pressure to open its markets to foreign-made tobacco products. Japan, one of the last refuges for the chain smoker, is an important market for U.S. companies, which have been watching the U.S. market shrink. Almost two-thirds of Japanese adult males smoke as do one-third of the adult women. That's a total of about 31.7 million smokers, government studies say.    But until recently, U.S. companies were unable to squeeze out even 2% of the Japanese cigarette market, the second largest in the non-Communist world after the U.S. That changed in the past few months after Japan finally dropped a tariff on top of a tax that penalized imports. The major U.S. tobacco companies lowered prices, advertised heavily and introduced new brands. As a result, their market share leaped to 8.1%.    &quot;I think the real game starts now,&quot; said Hiroshi Tanaka, a product-planning manager at Japan Tobacco Inc., Japan's tobacco monopoly, whose 56 cigarette brands still dominate the market. &quot;It's not a matter of price, but how attractive the different brands are,&quot; he said.    The flap has been in the news here for only two days, so it is too early to measure the results. But Hiroshi Okuzawa, manager of the Sunshine City Building tobacco store in Tokyo, says 10 people so far have brought back Winston Lights and asked to swap them for Japanese-made cigarettes. Hideki Kurosawa's store in Tokyo's Ginza district had been selling 2,000 packs of Winston Lights a month, but sales have dried up to virtually zero.    Store managers and tobacco company executives said that so far sales of other foreign brands haven't been hurt by Reynolds' problems, but they note that the news has only begun to spread. Joel Silverstein, manager for Brown andamp; Williamson (Japan) Inc., said, &quot;We are concerned that it will affect other imported cigarettes.&quot;    The U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. attorney in Greensboro, N.C., have begun a criminal investigation to determine whether Reynolds supplied false results on herbicide tests, or other deceptive information, involving imported tobacco.    Separately, Reynolds Tobacco said it now has &quot;reason to believe&quot; that the herbicide, Dicamba, came from U.S.-grown flue-cured tobacco. It believes the tainted tobacco was bought from independent growers by its R.J. Reynolds International Inc. unit and shipped to West Germany for blending.    A Reynolds Tobacco spokesman said the company reached that conclusion, of which it is &quot;reasonably certain,&quot; through its own testing and from data provided by the U.S. Agriculture Department, which has found more widespread use of Dicamba by tobacco-growers in this country than previously thought.    But the finding raises questions as to whether the Dicamba was confined to the cigarettes shipped by Reynolds to Japan or may be more widely found in cigarettes made for sale by Reynolds and others elsewhere. Reynolds is testing all of its inventory of tobacco bought in 1986 for Dicamba, according to the spokesman, who noted that none of the inventory has been used in products because it's in storage for aging.    Meanwhile, R.J. Reynolds' Japan unit is trying to limit the damage. &quot;We got higher awareness from this incident than (we could have gotten) in two years of advertising,&quot; said the unit's president, Keith M. McCulloch. The company ran ads in major newspapers Wednesday apologizing for the incident and reassuring smokers that no tainted cigarettes were sold to the public. It also met with Japanese reporters to stress there was no health hazard.    Reynolds has pulled all its ads for Winston Lights, which had been saturating Japanese TV in recent weeks, helping spur strong sales of about 63 million cigarettes in the first month. &quot;It's taken a long time to open this market,&quot; says John A. Clarke, Reynold's Japan marketing manager. &quot;It causes us a few problems just at the wrong time.&quot;    The Japanese also are angry about the way Reynolds handled the problem. The company knew that the cigarettes were tainted but didn't inform Japanese authorities until May 21. Reynolds says it wasn't obligated to inform the authorities and that it didn't violate any Japanese laws. &quot;We have acted in a responsible and forthright way to our consumers in Japan,&quot; said Mr. McCulloch.    All major tobacco firms, including the Japanese government tobacco company, have adopted a low profile. They have issued statements saying only that their products aren't tainted. &quot;It's a business custom in Japan that if one company has a problem then the others keep quiet,&quot; said a spokesman for Philip Morris K.K., the Japanese unit of Philip Morris Cos. But Brown andamp; Williamson is prepared to run ads guaranteeing the quality of its cigarettes, should the negative publicity refuse to die down.    Some U.S. officials worry that the herbicide-tainting will harm efforts to expand U.S. agricultural products in Japan. Japanese consumer groups said the Winston Lights incident lends credence to their argument that U.S. products are inferior. &quot;Consumers should be concerned about the products that come from far away,&quot; said Naoichi Takeuchi, president of Japan Consumers Union.    According to a U.S. trade official, the group &quot;that whoops it up about U.S. products will be able to use this to their advantage.&quot;    ----   Yumiko Ono contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
