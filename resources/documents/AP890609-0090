One tornado Thursday night wracked the Florida Panhandle fishingvillage of Eastpoint, killing three members of a family. Itdestroyed 19 houses and narrowly missed a nursing home.   ``We haven't found the house (where the family died) yet. Theirbodies were found several hundred yards from where the house oncewas,'' said Pat McWhinnie, Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher.   In Louisiana, cleanup efforts began today in the wake of Thursdaymorning's storms. Tornadoes hit seven parishes in the southern partof the state, killing two people in mobile homes in the town ofGrosse Tete and damaging scores of homes there and 15 miles east inBaton Rouge.   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' said Willie Hurdle, anIberville Parish official who surveyed the scene at Grosse Tete.``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't even hereanymore.''   About two dozen others were injured in the tornado.   Police sealed the town off to prevent looting and used dogs tosearch the rubble for bodies or survivors.   Officials used a chain saw to free an elderly woman from thewreckage of her home.   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter. He said twocompanies of Louisiana National Guard soldiers would be sent to helpauthorities enforce a night curfew to discourage looters.   Baton Rouge Fire Chief Ron Spillman said four tornadoes toucheddown 19 times in East Baton Rouge Parish, destroying or damagingalmost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses.   From 400 to 600 people lived in the destroyed or damagedresidences, Spillman estimated. A shelter was set up at a highschool for those left homeless.   Kimberly Carver was asleep in her mobile home at the Pecue LakeMobile Home Park when one of the twisters ripped through theneighborhood.   ``Somehow, I just ended up between the mattress and box springs.Everything in my bedroom was flying. If I wasn't between themattress and the box spring, I would have gotten hurt. It happenedso fast,'' Carver said.   Authorities reported three injuries in Baton Rouge, none serious.   Gulf State Utilities crews worked into the morning to restorepower to about 3,500 residents in the Baton Rouge area.   John Boss, a photographer for the State-Times in Baton Rouge, andRita F. Gilmer were caught in the middle of the storm near a bridgeover the Mississippi River.   ``Two houses blew up right across the levee from where we were,''he said. ``Limbs were snapping off trees and flying all over us. Wewere afraid we were going to be hit by all the debris. I was scaredto death. It was hell.''   In Florida, Franklin County Sheriff Warren Roddenberry saidtoday, ``We were extremely lucky. The devastation we've had and nomore than three fatalities and two minor injuries is just amazing.''   A grandmother, mother and son died when the tornado hit theirhome in Eastpoint, about 85 miles southwest of Tallahassee.   Most of the demolished houses in Eastpoint were mobile homes,officials said. Eight cars and several utility sheds also weredestroyed. A hardware store lost its roof, and a boat buildingbusiness was demolished.   ``It was monstrous _ like the tornado in the `Wizard of Oz,' ''said Tracey Hardman after seeing the twister. ``It was awesome.''   The tornados were the worst to hit the Panhandle in three years,said National Weather Service spokesman Ray Lowe.   Earlier Thursday, a U.S. park ranger was hurt when a tornadocarried away the shelter at Gulf Islands National Seashore in whichshe had taken refuge.
