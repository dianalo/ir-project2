The system of records is a consolidationof a number of preexisting systems of records, and includes investigatoryrecords for which the exemptions had previously been provided. The specificexemptions that had previously been claimed are preserved by the Chairman'saction. Because these exemptions may only be asserted with respect to investigatorymaterial compiled for law enforcement purposes, they are not being extendedto public material, including public litigation files, that have been madepart of the consolidated system of records. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also amended certain rules regardingassistance to foreign governments, to reflect the terminology containedin the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-704, 102 Stat. 4677 (``ITSFEA''). The ITSFEA authorizes increasedcooperation with ``foreign securities authorities,'' a term defined therein.These rule amendments will clarify that assistance may be provided to foreignsecurities authorities under rules that now provide generally for assistanceto, or otherwise refer to, foreign governmental authorities.The Commission has also adopted amendments that delegate authority to theDirector of the Division of Enforcement to grant requests made by trusteesin bankruptcy for access to enforcement files, and that remove a provisionregarding concurrence by the General Counsel in determinations to grantaccess requests in matters in which the Commission has entered a formalorder of investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Kenneth H.

Privacy Act Exemptions. </ITAG>Notice is hereby given that the Chairman of the Securities and ExchangeCommission has exempted a system of records from specified provisions ofthe Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The exempted system of recordsis a consolidation of previously-announced systems of records, maintainedby the Division of Enforcement, the Commission's Records Officer, and theCommission's Regional and Branch Offices. The consolidated system containsnonpublic investigatory records, as well as litigation files and otherpublic records. Section 552a(k)(2) of the Act provides that the head of an agency may promulgaterules to exempt any system of records within the agency from sections 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H) and (I), and (f) of the Act, if thesystem of records is ``investigatory material compiled for law enforcementpurposes.'' These sections of the Act from which exemption may be had generallyrequire the Commission to notify an individual, upon request, of the existenceof information contained in a record pertaining to the individual; permitaccess to such record and permit amendment or correction of such record;make available to an individual any required accounting of disclosuresto third-parties; publish the sources of information in the system of records;and screen records to insure that only such information is maintained aboutthe individual as is necessary and relevant to a required purpose of theCommission. The exemptions that may be asserted with respect to investigatorysystems of records permit an agency to protect information when disclosurewould interfere with the conduct of the agency's investigations. Rule 312(a) of the Commission's Rules of Information and Requests was previouslypromulgated to exempt the investigatory records that have been includedin the consolidated system of records. Rule 312(a) was based upon a findingthat, among other things, disclosure of information in these investigatoryfiles or disclosure of the identity of confidential sources would seriouslyundermine effective enforcement of the federal securities laws by prematurelyalerting individuals to the fact that they are under investigation or bygiving them access to the evidentiary bases for a Commission enforcementaction. In connection with the consolidation of the Commission's enforcement systemsof records, the Chairman has amended Rule 312(a) to delete references tothe separate systems of records that have been consolidated, and to adda reference to the new system. In addition, Rule 312(a) has been amendedto reflect the name change of the Securities Violations Records and Bulletinto its present designation as the Litigation, Actions and Proceedings Bulletin.The amendment of Rule 312(a) preserves the exemptions applicable underthe prior version of Rule 312(a) with respect to investigatory materialscompiled for law enforcement purposes. The amendment does not extend theexemption to public records, including public litigation files, that havebeen included in the consolidated system but were not previously in systemsof records that were exempted as investigatory materials compiled for lawenforcement purposes. The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is therefore promulgatingthe amendments to Rule 312(a) set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="84">2. ``Foreign Securities Authorities'' </ITAG>Notice is further given that the Securities and Exchange Commission hasadopted technical rule amendments to Rules 19b and 30-4(a)(7) of the Commission'sRules of Organization (17 CFR 200.19b and 30-4(a)(7)), Rules 80(b) and402 of the Rules of Information and Requests (17 CFR 200.80(b) and 402),Rule 5 of the Rules of Informal and Other Procedures (17 CFR 202.5), andRule 2 of the Rules Relating to Investigations (17 CFR 203.2), each ofwhich relates or refers to cooperation by Commission staff with foreigngovernments. Rule 19b describes the functional responsibilities of the Director of theDivision of Enforcement. Rule 30-4(a)(7) delegates authority to the Directorof the Division of Enforcement to grant requests from foreign governmentalauthorities, among others, for access to materials in the Commission'sfiles concerning nonpublic investigations. Rule 80(b) sets forth the exemptionsthat may be asserted by the Commission under the Freedom of InformationAct (``FOIA''). Rule 402 sets forth the exemptions that may be assertedby the Commission under the Government in the Sunshine Act (``SunshineAct''). Rule 5 provides an informal description of the Commission's proceduresin conducting investigations. Rule 2 permits members of the Commission'sstaff to engage in discussions with various entities, including representativesof foreign governmental authorities, concerning nonpublic investigations.The amendments adopted by the Commission with respect to these rules weremade as a result of the enactment of the ITSFEA, which, among other things,expands the Commission's authority to undertake investigations at the requestof foreign securities authorities. The ITSFEA amends the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934 by adding section 3(a)(50) which defines ``foreign securitiesauthority'' as ``any foreign government, or any governmental body or regulatoryorganization empowered by a foreign government to administer or enforceits laws as they relate to securities matters.''The rule amendments update the language of Rules 19b, 30-4(a)(7), 80(b),402, 5 and 2 by adding the term ``foreign securities authority,'' as definedin new section 3(a)(50), to existing references to foreign governmentalauthorities. The amendments will thereby clarify that assistance underthe rules will be provided to the foreign authorities specified in section3(a)(50) in addition to other foreign authorities, or will otherwise conformthe rules to the new statutory language. <T4>3. Delegation of Authority. </T4>The Commission has a statutory advisoryrole in proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, <T3>see </T3>11 U.S.C. 1109(a), and, from time to time, provides assistanceto trustees in bankruptcy by granting access to nonpublic information inenforcement files. The Commission has amended Rule 30-4(a)(7), the Commission'srule delegating authority to the Director of the Division of Enforcement,to delegate authority to the staff to grant such requests from trusteesin bankruptcy. The Commission has also amended Rules 19b and 2 to reflectthis delegation. In light of its experience in responding to access requests, the Commissionhas further amended Rule 30-4(a)(7) to remove the provision regarding concurrenceby the General Counsel in determinations to grant access requests in mattersin which the Commission has entered a formal order of investigation. TheCommission has also amended Rules 19b and 21 (17 CFR 200.21) to reflectthe removal of the concurrence requirement. The Commission has determined that the rule amendments relate solely toagency organization, procedure or practice. Therefore, the provisions ofthe Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') regarding notice of proposedrulemaking and opportunities for public participation, 5 U.S.C. 553, arenot applicable. Similarly, the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>., which apply only when notice and comment rulemaking arerequired by the APA or other law, are not applicable. The Commission findsthat the rule amendments will not impose any burden on competition. TheCommission further finds, because of the technical nature of the amendments,that the APA requirement with respect to delay in the effective date ofsubstantive rules, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), is also inapplicable to the amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>17 CFR Part 200 Organization; conduct and ethics; and information and requests 17 CFR Part 202 Informal and other procedures 17 CFR Part 203 Rules relating to investigations.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 17 of the Code of FederalRegulations is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 200_[AMENDED] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Organization and Program Management </ITAG>1.
