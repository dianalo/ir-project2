According to the poll, which was conducted Thursday and Friday, only 39% of those surveyed agreed with the statement that &quot;in general, the next president should continue along the path of Ronald Reagan's policies,&quot; while 54% agreed that &quot;in general, the next president should change direction in dealing with our nation's problems.&quot;    The poll found that 50% of those surveyed believe &quot;it's a good thing that the Democrats control Congress so that they can keep a check on the Reagan administration,&quot; while 42% agree with the statement that &quot;it would be better if the Republicans controlled Congress so that they could work with President Reagan and get more accomplished.&quot; Even one in five Republicans believes it's good that the Democrats control Congress, according to the poll.    The respondents split almost evenly over whether it would be better for the next president to be a Democrat or Republican, with 35% preferring a Democrat and 32% favoring a Republican. Some 12% of the respondents weren't sure, and 21% of them volunteered that the next president's party wouldn't make any difference.    Vice President George Bush remains first choice for the 1988 Republican nomination, the poll found.    Asked to choose among five potential GOP candidates, 32% of likely Republican and GOP-leaning voters preferred Mr. Bush. But his standing has diminished since a poll in August that showed him with 43%.    Senate GOP leader Robert Dole is in second place with 17%, up from 10% last summer. Rep. Jack Kemp's support remained at 9%, where he is now tied with former Sen. Howard Baker.    Among six possible Democratic candidates, former Sen. Gary Hart continues to lead the pack, with 31%, while New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is in second place with 18%. But 26% of the Democrats questioned said they want &quot;someone else&quot; to be the nominee. </TEXT></DOC>
