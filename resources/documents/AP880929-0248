(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It may be time for takeover strategistCarl Icahn and others involved in Texaco Inc.'s landmark bankruptcyreorganization to ``take their marbles and go home,'' according tothe judge who dismissed Icahn's challenge to the restructuring.   U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel ruled Wednesday that theIcahn Group's appeal of two key parts of the plan was moot becausethe group did not move fast enough to block confirmation ofTexaco's $5.6 billion reorganization.   Icahn, who is Texaco's largest shareholder, has sought to gainrepresentation on the oil giant's board of directors and otherwiseraise takeover pressure on the company in order to boost its stockprice.   ``Whatever future designs the Icahn Group may harbor for Texaco,fallout from the Texaco-Getty merger has been littering theeconomic landscape for the past four years,'' wrote Goettel.   The judge advised the parties to ``take their marbles and gohome, closing out one of the most bizarre chapters of Americanlegal and economic history.''   Neither Icahn nor Texaco had any immediate comment on the ruling.   Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. spawned a lawsuit byrival Pennzoil Co., which claimed Texaco wrongly interfered withits takeover of Getty.   In 1985, a Texas jury awarded Pennzoil $10.3 billion in damages,an award upheld throughout the Texas state courts.   To avoid having to post a bond equivalent to the award in orderto appeal the judgment, Texaco sought protection from creditorsunder Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law in April 1987.   When Texaco announced a $3 billion settlement with Pennzoil aspart of the reorganization plan, Icahn _ who controls 14.9 percentof Texaco's outstanding shares _ announced his opposition to twoaspects of the plan.   Icahn opposed a provision releasing Texaco's officers frompesonal liability resulting from the merger and attendant lawsuit.   Icahn also objected to a provision in a financing clause thatsaid any change of control in the company's management wouldconstitute default on a bank loan.   While objecting to the two provisions, Icahn nonetheless votedfor the plan and never sought a stay of the shareholder vote or ofits implementation.   The plan was approved by Texaco shareholders and the comapnyemerged from Chapter 11 in April.   Icahn later lost a proxy fight aimed at gaining control of fiveseats on the Texaco board.   In addition to the settlement with Pennzoil, Texaco'sreorganization included the sale of 50 percent of its refining andmarketing operations in 23 states to Saudi Arabia, the sale of itsWest German operations to Rheinish-WestfaelischesElektrizitaetswerk AG and the proposed sale of its 78 percent stakein Texaco Canada Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
