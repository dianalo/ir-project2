Voters in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll say by50% to 33% that the nation is on the wrong track, despiteBush's 67% job-approval rating. The wide disparity &quot;is highlyunusual,&quot; say Democratic pollster Peter Hart and GOP pollsterRobert Teeter, who took the survey, &quot;and those numberseventually tend to converge.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Bush's biggest weakness: domestic issues. Voters careabout them much more than about foreign policy -- and by 45%to 21% have little confidence in Bush's handling of them. Hemay use remarks to police and governors during his Augustvacation, and a number of school-related events around LaborDay, to raise his domestic issue profile.   But GOP strategists figure voters still don't trust aDemocratic president's ability to handle foreign affairs.                                                                                                          PUBLIC PRESSURE may give Bush additional leverage overIsrael.   In a striking departure from past sympathies, 37% seeIsrael as the biggest obstacle to peace; 35% cite the Arabnations. By almost two-to-one, those polled favor eithermaking U.S. loan guarantees to help house Soviet Jewsconditional on ending new settlements in the occupiedterritories -- or not giving the guarantees at all. By50%-34%, Americans favor a land-for-peace deal.   Pressure also builds on Shamir from American Jewishgroups. &quot;The American Jewish community is very anxious to seeIsrael join in the process,&quot; says Henry Siegman, executivedirector of the American Jewish Congress. But pro-Israellobbyists remain confident they can ram the loan guaranteesthrough Congress next month no matter what -- &quot;even if wehave to hand out noseplugs,&quot; says one.                                                                                                          CONCERN DIPS among voters on the deficit -- even as thedeficit itself rockets.   Despite the record $282 billion budget gap this year andan even bigger $348 billion projected for next year, theJournal/NBC poll finds only 27% cite it as the biggesteconomic problem. &quot;People have just gotten sick and tired ofit,&quot; says former congressional budget official RudolphPenner. Lawmakers push for more &quot;emergency&quot; spending, forwhich they don't need to find offsetting revenues.   But joblessness rises as a concern, cited by 35%, up from30% in June and only 16% last October. White House officialsworry that rising public concern could cause Bush headachesfor trying to block congressional efforts to expandunemployment benefits. &quot;It's a good political issue&quot; forDemocrats, admits a top White House aide.   The administration explores a compromise that wouldmodestly expand the benefits while cutting others -- such asMedicare or student loans -- for the wealthy.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS HOLD an early edge in the poll regardingcongressional voting intentions for 1992. Thirty-threepercent say they currently plan to vote for a Democrat, 29%for a GOP candidate. One key: By 61% to 28%, voters thinkit's better for the country to have Congress and the WhiteHouse controlled by different parties.                                                                                                          NOT MY GUY: Voters continue to hold Congress in deepdisrepute, the Journal/NBC poll shows: 63% disapprove of thejob it is doing, while only 28% approve. But by 59% to 29%,voters still approve of the job their individual lawmaker isdoing.                                                                                                          GATES BACKERS GRIPE that the White House hasn't workedhard enough to support the CIA nominee. Some press theadministration to ask ex-Carter aides Brzezinski andStansfield Turner, to speak up for him. Most voters haven'tmade up their mind about Gates -- but 75% oppose confirminghim if he misled Congress over Iran-Contra.                                                                                                          FINISH THE JOB: By a two-to-one margin, up from 54%-40% inMay, voters now think the war with Iraq was ended too soon.And nearly eight in 10 favor resuming military action if theIraqis continue to develop nuclear weapons.                                                                                                          BAD BET? Civil-rights groups take a big gamble in opposingThomas.   He remains an overwhelming favorite to win Supreme Courtconfirmation despite opposition from the NAACP and others. NoSouthern Democrats -- whose support would be crucial todefeat him -- have yet expressed any reservations. The WhiteHouse dispatches Sen. Danforth to warn that Bush won'tnominate another black if Thomas loses; he might turn to aconservative Hispanic.   In the poll, Thomas's confirmation is backed by 35% to 10%-- but 53% say they still need to know more about him. Thatmakes his confirmation hearings all the more crucial:Opponents will try to counter his image as personable andwarm with evidence that he has a volatile temper.   Abortion-rights supporters and opponents believe in equalnumbers -- about six in 10 -- that Thomas should publiclystate his views on the issue.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Bring on Rambo: 69% believe Americans arestill being held prisoner in Southeast Asia, andthree-quarters of those say the government isn't doing enoughto get them out. . . . Equal pluralities of whites andblacks, 42%, think Bush appointed Thomas because he is thebest man for the job, not because he is black.</TEXT></DOC>
