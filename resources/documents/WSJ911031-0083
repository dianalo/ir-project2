Analysts had predicted Chrysler would post a loss of asmuch as $225 million amid the industry's continuing salesslump. The results triggered a wave of enthusiasm forChrysler on Wall Street. The No. 3 U.S. auto maker's stockleaped $1.625 a share, or 15%, to $12.75 in composite tradingon the New York Stock Exchange, in volume of more than 3.2million shares.</LP><TEXT>   Including yesterday's run-up, the value of Chrysler'sstock has increased 26% since the strapped auto makersuccessfully sold 40.3 million new shares to the public fourweeks ago.   But promising as the third-quarter results seemed, theoutlook for the fourth quarter is turning cloudier.   Chrysler officials confirmed that the U.S. economy'smalaise recently forced them to scale back car and truckproduction plans for the fourth quarter nearly 10%. Thatmove, combined with plans for record advertising spending anda likely increase in less-profitable sales to big fleets,will make it tough for Chrysler to show fourth-quarterprofit. Some analysts had predicted Chrysler would earn asmuch as 30 cents a share in the final period; now, some areplanning to lower their estimates.   Moreover, it's getting increasingly difficult for Chryslerto squeeze further efficiencies from its operations. The automaker reached its goal of paring expenses by $3 billion, orroughly 10%, when the third quarter began. Jerome B. York,the company's executive vice president and chief financialofficer, compared the job of getting further cost-reductionsto wringing water out of a damp rag. Nonetheless, he said,Chrysler will continue its cost-cutting campaign.   &quot;Our results, when compared with {Ford Motor Co. andGeneral Motors Corp.} show we are further along in achievingfundamental change,&quot; Mr. York said in an interview. &quot;We areincreasing our efficiency in day-to-day operations and theway we develop new products.&quot; Earlier this month, GM andFord, both much larger than Chrysler, reported a combinedthird-quarter loss of $1.63 billion.   While the cost-containment effort played a significantrole in limiting Chrysler's losses, it wasn't the onlyfactor.   Chrysler also benefited by reducing its reliance on salesto such fleet buyers as car-rental companies. Auto makerstypically get little or no profit on fleet sales. In somecases discounts on those sales are up to $2,000 more thanincentives offered to retail consumers.   Mr. York said just 16% of the cars and light trucks thatChrysler sold in the third quarter went to fleets. Thatcompares with the 25% of vehicle sales that fleets claimed inthe first half of the year.   Chrysler's results for the third quarter do not includethe $386 million it raised in its recent stock offering. Theresults also exclude the gain of more than $100 million thatChrysler will get by selling its half of the Diamond-Starcar-assembly venture it runs in Normal, Ill. to partnerMitsubishi Motors Corp. Chrysler said it will book that gainin the fourth quarter.   In the 1990 third quarter, Chrysler reported a loss of$214 million, or 95 cents a share. Chrysler lost productionof 54,000 minivans in the year-earlier quarter when it shutthe plants that build its most profitable vehicle to preparefor a restyled model.   Increased minivan output this year helped spark a 15%increase in Chrysler's revenue to $7.49 billion. Chrysler'sfactory vehicle sales also rose to 453,349 cars and lighttrucks from 412,723 in the 1990 third quarter.   Profits from Chrysler's financial services subsidiarypartly made up for the $163 million loss the company'sautomotive operations posted. Chrysler Financial Corp.reported earnings of $81 million, down from recordthird-quarter earnings of $83 million a year earlier.   Chrysler Financial's asset base shrank to $21.8 billionfrom $24.4 billion a year earlier. That's primarily becausethe unit is raising funds by packaging and selling its assetssince its access to credit markets has been hampered by itsjunk-bond credit rating.   Chrysler prevented further erosion to its cash andmarketable securities -- a key issue since the company isforging ahead with plans to spend $16.6 billion on newproducts and plant improvements through 1995. For example,spending to launch production of the new Jeep Grand Cherokeewagon, which is scheduled to hit the market in the spring,reached $150 million in the third quarter.   At the end of the third quarter, Chrysler had $2.5 billionin cash, compared with $2.4 billion at the end of the secondquarter. As a result, Mr. York said he'd be &quot;highlysurprised&quot; if Chrysler had to tap its $1.75 billion standbyline of bank credit.</TEXT></DOC>
