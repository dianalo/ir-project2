He's returned to San Jose. And he's rejoined his wife,Susan.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CONVICT USES VICTIMS' RIGHTS LOOPHOLEWIFE SEEKS RECORDS ON BEHALF OF MATE JAILED FORTRYING TO KILL HER  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But the Bowens, who are trying to rebuild their lives and make up for theyears they lost, are still haunted by the legacy of a court case they believewas wrong from the start.;   The couple recently filed suit to get the policerecords pertaining to Bowen's conviction by cleverly employing a loophole inthe state's Public Records Act.;   And Richard Bowen is still pursuing a civilsuit against former San Jose Police Chief Joe McNamara, alleging that McNamarainstructed witnesses not to talk to defense attorneys or to Bowen.;   Thelawsuits -- all drawn and filed by Bowen himself -- are part of a concertedeffort to clear his name. And to prove that his wife, who suffers fromresidual brain-stem damage caused by the poisoning, has good reason to staywith a man convicted of trying to kill her.;   Both Richard and Susan Bowendeclined to be interviewed for this story, saying they want to maintain theirprivacy. But in a written statement, Susan Bowen, 39, explained:;   &quot;I was ontrial along with Richard. I was accused of being a wife that did not have amind of her own and not having enough self respect and self-esteem to care ifsomeone tried to kill her . . .;   &quot;The person who tried to kill me may neverstand trial, but I will continue the fight. Justice will eventually prevailand my name . . . will be cleared.&quot;;   While Bowen and his wife maintain thathe has been railroaded, a jury convicted him of attempted murder and a stateappellate court in 1989 upheld the conviction.;   Case began in 1982;   Thecase began on Nov. 26, 1982, when Susan Bowen was poisoned and collapsed onthe bathroom floor of her home. Pale and not breathing, she was rushed to GoodSamaritan Hospital.;   The poisoning triggered extensive publicity and afive-state recall of Anacin-3 pain reliever, the medicine Susan Boweninitially said she had taken.;   In later interviews with police from herhospital bed, she said she took a red and white sleeping pill. It was herhusband, she reportedly told police, who told her to say she had takenAnacin-3.;   At his trial, Susan Bowen testified that she couldn't remembermaking those statements to police, nor could she recall what type ofmedication she took.;   Bowen, who worked as a Mercury News circulationmanager at the time of his arrest, said his wife was poisoned by a taintedAnacin-3 pill that was contaminated at the factory -- not a cyanide-lacedsleeping pill.;   Tried to buy insurance;   But prosecutor Lane Liroffpresented evidence that Bowen was having an affair with another woman a monthprior to the poisoning and that Bowen had tried to buy life insurance for hiswife.;   After less than seven hours of deliberation, jurors found Bowenguilty, and he was sentenced to 12 years in state prison. There, Bowencontinued to search for new evidence. He filed unsuccessful lawsuits againstthe San Jose Police Department and Liroff to obtain police records and witnessstatements.;   He also began writing to Liroff. One letter read in part:&quot;Lane: What's up punk? Well guess what. Your dead.  . . . You punk, I am goingto get some capsules for you. Guess what will be in them. Happy chewing.  . ..&quot;;   Threatening letters;   Liroff said reading the letters was &quot;a terrifyingexperience . . . Here's a man who has protested his innocence all along andhere he is threatening me precisely with the behavior that implicates hisguilt in all this.&quot;;   In a prepared statement, Bowen said he regrets writingthe letters, which he described as the product of the pain, stress andfrustration of prison. And he says that Liroff and other authorities didn'ttake the letters seriously, anyway.;   &quot;Unless you have spent several years incages that have less square feet per inmate than cages required for dogkennels; knowing you have not done anything wrong; combined with watching thepain your family must endure . . . then one could never understand aboutactions that are thereafter regrettable.&quot;;   On Sept. 5, two days after Bowenwas released from state prison in Chino, Liroff said he walked out of hisoffice to pick up his paycheck. Bowen was at a secretary's desk, serving legalpapers to obtain police records.;   Victims' access to records;   This time,Bowen and his wife filed a request under a section of the state Public RecordsAct that allows a victim, or the victim's representative, access to records.Susan Bowen said she sought the records to &quot;ensure&quot; that she was getting allthe facts about her case.;   &quot;Richard has assured me that he has not withheldanything from me,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but my family states the police have told themthat he has.&quot;;   In October, Superior Court Judge David Leahy denied theBowens' request, but marveled at their ingenuity in using the statute.;  &quot;This is an unusual case,&quot; Leahy said. &quot;The request really turns the act onits head: the strange idea that a person convicted of a crime uses thevictim's rights to obtain the records to continue his fight.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RODNEY FOO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  921  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 1, 199100336086,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
