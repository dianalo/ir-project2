The ``DNA microinjection process'' was developed by Thomas E.Wagner, a molecular geneticist at the university, and Peter C.Hoppe, a researcher at Jackson Laboratories at Bar Harbor, Maine.   Microinjection is a microsurgical technique in which geneticmaterial with a new, desirable trait is injected into an embryoshortly after fertilizaion.   It is being used to develop genetically modified animals thatcould boost agricultural production and improve medical andpharmaceutical research and manufacturing.   In microinjection, the developing embryo incorporates the newgene into its genetic makeup, passing on the improved trait tofuture generations of so-called ``transgenic'' animals.   ``Transgenic animals are emerging as a fundamental tool inmedical and pharmaceutical research and product development,chemical safety testing and in the improvement of the health andvalue of livestock animals,'' said Paul Schmitt, president ofPrinceton, N.J.-based DNX Inc., the only business licensed by theuniveristy to use the process.   ``Since the patent covers a fundamental and widely usedtechnology, we expect to establish a broad commercial licensingprogram,'' he said.   Wagner and Hoppe assigned the patent to OU, and Wagner'sroyalties will go to the OU Foundation, which supports research bythe Edison Animal Biotechnology Center in Athens. Wagner isdirector of the center.   In 1981, Wagner led a team first that used the technique totransfer a gene for rabbit hemoglobin _ the material in red bloodcells that carries oxygen thoughout the body _ into a mouse embryo,passing rabbit blood traits to the mouse.   Pigs, rats, mice, goats and other animals have since beenaltered using the technique.   Wagner was first interested in the concept for boostingagricultural production, such as by producing cows that give moremilk or animals that are disease-resistant.   He said there is even more potential in medical research,including development of mice and other research animals that candevelop human diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis or acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome, and can be used to test medications.   Sheep have been bio-engineered to produce milk carrying a vitalhuman blood clotting factor that hemophiliacs need, Wagner said.Mice have been altered to produce milk containing TPA, a proteinprescribed for heart attack victims.   The process works because it is natural for chromosomes, thecell's long strands of genes, to be damaged. While the cell repairsitself, the foreign genetic material is incorporated intochromosomes. The altered egg is then implanted into a surrogatemother.   Ohio University said DNA microinjection was the techniqueemployed by Harvard researcher Phil Leder to develop the firstpatented transgenic animal, the ``Harvard mouse.''   Microinjection also is used in the development of improvedlivestock, much of which is done by DNX.   DNX was formed in 1984 as the Edison Center's private-sectorpartner to develop commercial applications of prototype organismsproduced by OU scientists.</TEXT></DOC>
