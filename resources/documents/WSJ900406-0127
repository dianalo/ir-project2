Approval of the acid-rain amendment, which came on a 39-4vote, cleared the last major obstacle before passage of theoverall bill. The bill would impose about $20 billion incosts annually on industry to clean up acid rain, smog andtoxic emissions from chemical plants and other facilities.</LP><TEXT>   Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) called thebill &quot;necessary&quot; and said it would yield environmentalbenefits, but would also &quot;have a significantly adverse impacton jobs and the economy.&quot; He predicted that the bill,approved 42-1 by the committee, would reach the House flooraround the middle of May. William Dannemeyer (R., Calif.)cast the only negative vote.   Significantly, the acid-rain amendment doesn't include anexplicit subsidy for Midwest utilities, something that theadvocates of such cost-sharing have fought for over the pastyear.   Providing financial aid for the Midwest was &quot;neveraccepted at any point, at any time, anywhere,&quot; said Rep. PhilSharp (D., Ind.), who led the cost-sharing drive.   Instead, the measure would aid utilities in the Midwest aswell as utilities in Western states and other regions thathave been seeking assurances they can expand. It would dothis by tinkering with the pollution-trading system to becreated by the legislation.   Under the system, utilities that make especially deep cutsin sulfur-dioxide emissions would get pollution credits thatthey could sell or swap with other utilities, which could usethem to expand.   The acid-rain provision would impose costs of $4 billionannually on industry to clean up acid rain, which harms lakesand trees in New England and Canada. Under the bill, 111dirty coal-burning power plants in 21 states would have tomake deep cuts in sulfur-dioxide emissions by 1996. More than200 additional power plants nationwide would have to makecuts by 2001. A total 10 million tons a year in emissionswould be cut.   The bill would include a nationwide cap on total powerplant emissions, designed to preserve the pollution gainswell into the next century.   The agreement on acid rain was reached after several longnights of intense bargaining between lawmakers from theMidwest and those from the so-called clean states.   The amendment would generate additional pollution creditsfor utilities in the Midwest and clean states by requiringdeeper emissions cuts from all utilities affected by thefirst phase. In addition, it would require cuts from severalpower plants owned by the Energy Department and certain smallutilities that weren't previously covered.   Midwest plants would also benefit from certain provisionsdesigned to encourage utilities to install emission-scrubbingdevices rather than switching to cleaner, low-sulfur coal.These changes are designed in part to preserve mining jobs.Bill Samuel, a lobbyist for the United Mine Workers, said hebelieved the House provisions would result in fewer joblosses among miners than the bill passed this week by theSenate.   The Senate bill would generate additional allowances tohelp the same groups of utilities, but does so by moving upthe two deadlines for cutting emissions.   The committee's overall bill is stronger than the Senate'slegislation in some respects, and weaker in others. On smog,the House bill calls for a stronger federal role in forcingcleanups by states and cities. It would also tailorrequirements to the severity of an area's smog problem.   Environmentalists also prefer the committee's provision oncancer-causing industrial emissions.   The Senate, however, calls for a significantly strongerprogram requiring the use of reformulated gasoline or othercleaner alternatives to conventional fuel in the smoggiestcities. The Senate's provisions on auto-tailpipe exhaust arealso more stringent.</TEXT></DOC>
