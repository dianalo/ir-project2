The network presented its proposal for production standards for high-definition television to the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers at the group's convention here Saturday.    The standards are backed by a number of U.S. television makers and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC-TV unit, said NBC, a unit of General Electric Co. &quot;It will not make obsolete the existing 160 million TV sets Americans now own,&quot; said NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge. He said NBC had invested about $50 million in the technology.    High-definition TV produces clearer, brighter images on a wider TV screen with high-quality sounds. Demand for high-definition TV is expected to surge in the next few years as picture tubes become larger and screens wider. The advancement is also seen as a technology to put new life in the U.S. electronics industry, Mr. Rutledge said.    The Federal Communications Commission last month set preliminary guidelines to allow research to proceed toward establishing a U.S. high-definition system. Under the FCC rules, a U.S. system must be able to be received on existing TV sets so current equipment wouldn't become obsolete. To receive improved picture quality, viewers would have to buy a new TV set.    The FCC's action, Mr. Rutledge said, removed a lot of the &quot;regulatory hoops&quot; and is expected to facilitate approval of NBC's proposed standards.    About 20 advanced-TV systems are under development and competing to be designated as the U.S. standard. </TEXT></DOC>
