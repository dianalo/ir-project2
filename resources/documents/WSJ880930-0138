The suit, filed in federal court by the three New Jersey residents, seeks back pay, unspecified damages and reinstatement. It seeks class-action status on behalf of more than 350 former non-union Merrill Lynch employees in the New York area who were over 40 years old when they were discharged during the brokerage firm's cutback of 3,500 employees following the market collapse.    The plaintiffs' lawyer said the suit refers to former managerial and administrative staffers who earned more than $45,000 a year. The suit alleges the plaintiffs, who worked at the Plainsboro, N.J., office, were dismissed in January 1988 and weren't afforded the opportunity to transfer to other positions within the firm, which were held or filled by younger employees.    A spokesman for New York-based Merrill Lynch said the cutbacks involved positions where there was more than one person in a specific job category. He said the job eliminations were based on merit, not on age or salary.    The plaintiffs, who had worked for Merrill Lynch for 14 to 32 years, are Michael J. Burke, 52, of Middletown, former vice president, institutional marketing mutual funds products; T. Frank De Guzman, 63, of Lincroft, former vice president, manager of clearing operations; and Frank G. Piazza, 60, of Mahwah, former assistant odd-lot equity trader.    Mr. Burke, as a required prerequisite to the suit, filed an age-discrimination complaint against Merrill Lynch in April in the New York City and Newark district offices of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
