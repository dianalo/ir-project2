But we now have the opportunity toretaliate against the American troops and other crusaders who are astone's throw from us,'' Ali al-Fakir, minister of religiousaffairs, told 10,000 worshippers attending a prayer sermon.   Al-Fakir, a sheik who was elected to Parliament last year,previously has stressed that political statements he makes atFriday prayer gatherings or reflect only his personal opinion andnot that of the government.   ``I assure you that you will take them captives and shackle themwith chains as Moslems did with crusaders'' in the 12th century, hetold the crowd at Hamzah Mosque in the suburb of Marka, five mileseast of Amman.   Fakir also blasted Egypt and Syria for committing troops to theU.S.-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2invasion of Saudi Arabia.   Many Moslems view the presence of non-Moslem forces in thekingdom that harbors Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina asan insult to their faith.   ``That decision by Cairo and Damascus was inspired by materialmotives. Which is dearer to the nation, Kuwait or Palestine?'' hesaid criticizing the Arabs' failure to fight Israel to regainterritories lost in the 1967 war, including Jerusalem.   ``Which is more sacred, the oil wells or Jerusalem's Al-AqsaMosque?'' he said, referring to Islam's third holiest shrine.   The Jordanian government has officially condemned the invasionof Kuwait and called for an Iraqi withdrawal. However, as a closeally of Iraq it has denounced the foreign military intervention inthe region, urging an Arab solution to the problem.</TEXT></DOC>
