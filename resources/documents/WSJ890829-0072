The injured ride in new ambulances. A cancer fund is $5,000 richer, and federal prisoners play baseball with new gloves.    In Colonia Hidalgo, a middle-class enclave, his neighbors adore him. Even after his pet tiger got loose, gifts of peaches, homemade stew and warm burritos kept coming. &quot;To me, he is a generous person,&quot; coos 75-year-old Eteloina Cobos, who keeps a picture of the 36-year-old ex-carpenter in her worn bible.    Yet just across the river in El Paso, Texas, the name Ontiveros is cursed. &quot;Sick,&quot; spits Moises Bujanda, nursing a beer in a hotel bar. &quot;This guy is perverting our society.&quot; To local editorial writers, Mr. Ontiveros is a &quot;bloody toad&quot; and &quot;Border Creep No. 1.&quot;    Mr. Ontiveros has made a fortune selling drugs to America. He &quot;is one of the most significant godfathers and Robin Hood figures along the U.S.-Mexico border,&quot; maintains Phillip E. Jordan, special agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's regional office in Dallas.    This man known as &quot;El Grenas&quot;, or Mophead, is a living explanation of why it is so difficult to halt the flood of illicit drugs across the Texas-Mexico border. For no amount of law enforcement can offset the huge gap in attitudes toward drug trafficking that separates the U.S. and Mexico.    Mr. Ontiveros admits he became rich shipping marijuana by the ton to the Southwest, but says he no longer sells drugs. He denies DEA allegations that he ships Colombian cocaine to dozens of crack zones in Houston, Dallas, New York and Chicago. Twice indicted by El Paso federal grand juries, accused of kidnappings and beatings in addition to drug running, he has been in a Mexican prison since January pending trial on Mexican drug-related charges. But his drug operations weren't halted until last month, say Mexican authorities.    Indeed, despite intensified anti-drug efforts by the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the DEA says Mexico is &quot;the surest and safest pipeline to the U.S.,&quot; funneling one-third of America's cocaine and marijuana and considerable amounts of heroin. To people like 58-year-old Willie Osborne of Houston, the suppliers of those drugs are a curse. They &quot;destroy the neighborhood and the minds of the young people&quot; and make life dangerous for all, she complains, watching an arrest in her crack-infested Acres Home neighborhood.    But here in Mexico, citizens blame decadent American appetites, not those who feed them. Many believe Mexico is culturally superior to the U.S., says Rodolfo de la Garza, a professor of Mexican-American studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Some Mexicans view themselves as &quot;Greeks and the people of the U.S. as Romans,&quot; with drugs being just another U.S. vice, he says.    It helps that Mexico isn't plagued by crack zones and 13-year-old addicts. A $10 crack rock, a cheap high in the U.S., costs the equivalent of three days' pay here. &quot;Americans have created the problem,&quot; declares Albert Kenyon Wagner, the Mexican-born director of a rural Mormon school south of here. It's unfair, he says, to expect &quot;my country to solve the problem.&quot; Even Mexican drug agent Jose Luis Lopez tells a visitor that if U.S. parents would only &quot;teach their children the evils of drugs, it would make our job easier.&quot;    In addition, intractable official corruption makes it difficult to tell the bad guys from the good guys. &quot;Everyone knew&quot; the &quot;famous 'Grenas'&quot; was a drug lord, says Pedro Contreras, who lived on Tepeyac Street with the Mophead. But &quot;I felt secure because I knew the guy was protected by police.&quot; Then, in one of the ironies that abound along the border, Mr. Contreras earnestly explains that he would never live in the U.S.: &quot;We're afraid our son would get involved in drugs.&quot;    Mr. Ontiveros embraces the popular wisdom. &quot;As long as there is drug demand, there will be drug supply,&quot; he reasons during a prison interview. With his trademark longish hair tucked under a hat, a diamond-encrusted Rolex watch on his wrist, he argues that he is in jail only because of politics. &quot;The U.S. is putting pressure on Mexico to get tough and, because I'm so popular and outspoken, they come after me,&quot; he says.    The Mexican government counts Mr. Ontiveros as one of five major &quot;narcotraficantes&quot; it has nabbed this year. It charges that he bribed officials with upwards of $800,000 and moved more than eight tons of marijuana across the border. While he admits to having sold marijuana in the U.S., Mr. Ontiveros is contesting these particular charges.    In the U.S., a 1986 indictment in El Paso charges him with smuggling up to five tons a month of marijuana across the border and with kidnapping and torturing two men and attempting to kidnap a third. Efforts to extradite Mr. Ontiveros to face U.S. charges consistently fail. Mexican authorities assert the priority of their own case.    But along Tepeyac Street, no one talks of such things. Neighbors were outraged when the Mexican attorney general's agents confiscated Mr. Ontiveros's elegant home and turned it into a makeshift jail and command post. The morality of seizing Mr. Ontiveros's property was the issue, not Mr. Ontiveros's morality.    Explains Sara Villalpando, a college student who lives across the street: &quot;In the United States, you must ask, 'How is it possible to respect someone who is a narcotraficante?' But here, we would respect someone like this because there is no law, the authorities have no morality.&quot;    Any doubt that Mr. Ontiveros is an important man in Juarez quickly vanished during a June 22 visit with him in prison here, where he was held until being transferred last month. His &quot;cell&quot; consisted of two air-conditioned, carpeted rooms, well-stocked with middle-class amenities -- a microwave oven, a Nintendo entertainment unit, phones and baby formula for visits from one of his many illegitimate children. In his bedroom, a woman fussed with her looks; outside, a carpenter worked on a patio, a puppy stepped in the fresh cement.    Mr. Ontiveros proudly displayed other trappings -- shirts, baseball caps, pens and lingerie with &quot;I love Grenas&quot; scrawled in green letters. But he seemed proudest of his electronic communications gear, including regular telephones, cellular phones, walkie-talkies and a short-wave radio: &quot;I hate surprises,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to know what's happening in my jail.&quot;    Mr. Ontiveros raised prison living standards considerably, arranging for a sauna, a racquetball court, a bakery, pigs for barbecues, and a canteen dispensing everything from cologne to corn flakes. But two weeks after the interview, a new warden took over the prison, and on July 20, Mr. Ontiveros was hauled off to a more conventional Mexico City cell.    The new warden, state prison director Gabriel Nahas Ayub, alleges that Mr. Ontiveros was brazenly running a $400,000-a-month drug operation from the prison and that a weekly stream of four-digit bribes kept the previous warden from asking questions. Mexican and U.S. authorities say they monitored Mr. Ontiveros on his cellular telephone directing an abortive February attempt to land 1,430 pounds of pure Colombian cocaine on a clandestine airstrip 70 miles away. The previous warden couldn't be reached for comment.    As in Juarez, the influence of drug money is evident in Casas Grandes, a dusty agricultural town about 150 miles away whose economy was dead until drug lords arrived in the early 1980s.    Groves of apple trees were replaced with stalks of marijuana. Jobs proliferated. Workers, as young as 12, would wait each morning in front of a Catholic church for buses to the marijuana fields. Recruiting was easy. Employees got a free meal, transportation, beer and daily wages equal to a week's pay in the &quot;maquilas&quot;, the U.S. factories up at the border.    Casas Grandes became a builder's paradise. Restaurants boomed. Asphalt poured. New trucks sped down the city's main artery. Many people headed for a discotheque called the Camelot, a castle-shaped venture alleged to be owned by drug kingpins including Mr. Ontiveros, though he denies being involved.    Marijuana provided stability, concedes the Rev. Abel Retano Valle, a local Catholic priest. &quot;Can you imagine?&quot; he asks. &quot;Those of my parish no longer had to go to the U.S. to work.&quot; Nonetheless, the priest adds, &quot;It was a fictitious economy because sooner or later it had to end.&quot;    It did, when the Mexican federal judicial police arrived in March. But now, federal agents toting pistols and automatic weapons say residents stare at them in disgust in restaurants.    At an Argentinian-style steak house, Mexican drug agent Jose Lopez and his commander, Salvador Chavez, brood over plans to burn a marijuana field in the Sierra Madre at dawn. Mr. Chavez, a husky 44-year-old, stabs his beef tips but eyes two men in white cowboy hats suspiciously. Suddenly, the electricity goes off. Mr. Lopez clenches his assault rifle. Mr. Chavez fingers his pistol. The lights flicker on again. False alarm.    &quot;Businessmen urge us to ease off,&quot; says Mr. Lopez. &quot;They say we're hurting the economy.&quot;    All of this rankles in El Paso, the sunbaked city of 530,000 that stands cheek-by-jowl with Juarez. Although crack isn't yet a crisis in El Paso, &quot;We're right in the middle of this drug war,&quot; says Carmen Perez Humphreys, a mother of three. &quot;I can understand that in Mexico {Mr. Ontiveros} helps provide jobs for people and with jobs people are able to eat,&quot; she says. &quot;But on this side, he's killing our people.&quot;    Perhaps because of such worries, justice is stiffening in El Paso. In June, a first-time offender who had attempted to sell four pounds of cocaine to undercover agents was given a life sentence. Still, Richard D. Schwein, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in El Paso, keeps a cap behind his desk with a logo that reads: &quot;The boss? Grenas, of course.&quot;    What's the point?    It's a reminder, he says, that &quot;we're losing the drug war.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
