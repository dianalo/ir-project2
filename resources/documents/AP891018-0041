The Senate approved the package 64 to 35 late Tuesday aftersoundly defeating a series of attempts to cut or restrict themoney. The House had approved it Oct. 4 on a vote of 263-156.   Bush is expected to sign the measure soon so that aid can beginto flow this month, the only month when voter registration isconducted for the Feb. 25, 1990, balloting.   The opposition coalition, known as UNO, ``needs our assistancedesperately,'' Bush wrote in a last-minute letter to the Senateurging support for the package. ``Only by receiving help can itmake a real contest of this election,'' he wrote.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the upcomingelections ``the last crucial shot at getting representativedemocracy in Nicaragua.''   Agreement on the package represented a political truce of sortson what has been the most divisive foreign policy issue to confrontCongress this decade.   Since President Reagan helped create the Contra rebels eightyears ago to oust the leftist Managua government, the United Stateshas spent some $350 million to apply military pressure, with eachincrement of aid heatedly fought in Congress. Congressionalrestrictions on Contra aid played a large role in Reagan's greatestscandal, the Iran-Contra affair.   In his letter to lawmakers, Bush acknowledged administrationdiscomfort with a Nicaraguan law that could send as much as $2million directly to the Sandinista-controlled Supreme ElectoralCouncil. But he added: ``We should not let this displeasure ... beused as a transparent attempt to prevent the United States fromhelping its democratic friends.''   The package would send $9 million through the National Endowmentfor Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that promotes democraticelections around the world to pay for ostensibly nonpartisanactivities like voter registration, election monitoring and partybuilding.   While NED's charter forbids direct partisan campaign support,the Bush administration believes that money spent to promote thedemocratic process will work to the advantage of oppositionpresidential candidate Violeta Chamorro, publisher of theopposition newspaper La Prensa.   The opposition coalition includes 14 parties spanning thespectrum from conservative to socialist and communist. Partyofficials complain they lack even basic office supplies, while theruling Sandinistas have all the resources of the government,including state-run media, at their disposal.   While the legislation was vague on how the money will be used,it appeared that up to $6 million could go directly to the UNOopposition group and as much as $2 million to thegovernment-controlled electoral council. Nicaraguan law levies a 50percent tax on foreign political contributions for certain purposes.   The endowment has been involved in elections in the Philippines,Chile and Poland, among others. But critics _ both liberals andconservatives _ point out that the administration's plannedspending in Nicaragua far exceeds anything the endowment has usedin other countries. Congress already had given it $3.5 million inthe last year to aid the election process there.   ``Rather than ensuring free and fair elections, this packagecould well undermine them,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``Do wereally want Mrs. Chamorro to be known as the best candidate theUnited States can buy?''   Harkin and others also attacked the vagueness of the spendingrequest. While just over $1 million of the money would go to threeindependent election monitoring groups, including one led by formerPresident Carter, the rest of the money is less specificallydescribed.   The endowment could conduct get-out-the-vote activities, paycosts of voter registration campaigns, civic education aboutelections and spend money to ``build party infrastructures.''   The measure would authorize no new money, but would insteadtransfer the funds to the endowment from unspent balances in otheraccounts. As a condition of the aid, the administration gaveCongress private assurances it would not seek to covertly influencethe election.</TEXT></DOC>
