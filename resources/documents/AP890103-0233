Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the European Economic Community,said that by Thursday he expected representatives of the 12-nationtrading bloc would be given a proposal for imposing higher duties oncertain U.S. products.   The plan would be offered to counter measures the United Statesput into effect Sunday to retaliate against the European meat ban.   Approval of such a proposal would escalate a dispute that alreadythreatens to become a serious trans-Atlantic commercial war, hurtinga market in which two-way trade totaled an estimated $166 billionlast year.   The community's executive body, the European Commission, earliervowed to slap higher duties on such U.S. imports as walnuts, honey,dried fruit and canned corn.   Wegter said, ``The principle of retaliation on our part isalready confirmed. It's already there. The only question is how weput that into practical terms.''   The final details and enforcement date of any such action wouldhave to be approved by the member governments.   American officials have raised the prospect of taking additionalsteps against any counter-measures imposed by the Europeans. AlfredKingon, U.S. ambassador to the EEC, said last week, ``I think it'sfair to say that you can anticipate further action on our side.''   The friction was touched off by the enforcement on Sunday of anEEC ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.The trading bloc, also known as the Common Market, wants to prohibitfor health reasons all meat from such animals.   ``Officially, there is no possibility of accepting meat comingfrom the United States that has been treated with hormones,'' Wegtertold reporters.   The ban is expected to block the importation of about $100million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States,some of which are used in making pates and sausages. The measureexempts imports used to make pet food.   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fattencattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose ahealth risk.   The prohibition was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but thetrading bloc agreed to a one-year delay. It has since refused U.S.appeals for another postponement.   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States applied onSunday trade sanctions worth about $100 million against Europeangoods.   The measures impose 100 percent duties on boneless beef, hams andpork shoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee,fermented alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcoholby volume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food madefrom grains.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said last week that theEEC's ban on U.S. meat was an unfair trade practice and thereforejustified the American retaliation.   The additional tariffs are to remain in effect for the durationof the meat ban.   But Wegter contended the U.S. retaliatory duties were notjustified.   ``We are entitled to have our own standards for the quality ofour foodstuff,'' he said.   ``If the Americans would like to breed with hormones, it'scompletely their affair,'' he said. ``The only thing we are askingis that to the extent they are exporting to us, they should certifythat there is no breeding with hormones.''   EEC members could adopt the counter-measures against the UnitedStates later this week, Wegter said. But he added they also couldrefer the matter to key ministers scheduled to gather later in themonth. Agriculture ministers from the 12 nations will meet Jan. 16and foreign ministers on Jan. 23.   Wegter said, ``We do not like the idea of having a trade war. ...The more things can be kept under control and kept in its ownproportion the better it is.''   Wegter said that last fall, the EEC proposed settling the disputeby boosting imports of high-quality U.S. beef in return for Americanacceptance of the hormone ban. The offer, he said, was not accepted.   EEC members are: France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spainand the United Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
