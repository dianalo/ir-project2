Maybe. Mrs. Marcos says she hopes to come next week in achartered jetliner that will carry friends and supporters,100 medical personnel to aid victims of recent naturaldisasters, and about 100 reporters. But she doesn't rule outthe chance that her plans could change.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are so many possibilities,&quot; she said in a telephoneinterview from her New York City apartment. &quot;God willing, wehope to be in Manila on Monday morning.&quot;   She added, however, that her staff was having troubleobtaining Philippine aviation clearance for the charteredjetliner. In Manila, meanwhile, officials said they hadagreed that a Marcos-chartered Boeing 747 could land, butonly if it came on Sunday.   Assuming that such differences are ironed out, and thatother obstacles don't arise to prevent Mrs. Marcos frommaking the trip, her arrival will mark the opening bars of alively coda to a political career that has combined elementsof tragic opera and outrageous musical farce.   Mrs. Marcos has long insisted that it is her sacred dutyto bury her husband in the Philippines; Mr. Marcos died inexile in Honolulu in September 1989. Since Manila announcedlast March that Mrs. Marcos would be permitted to return hometo face the charges against her, she has made at least eightchanges in her travel plans. Several times she has had adeparture schedule and then canceled, complaining that shecouldn't make the trip while the government banned the returnof her husband's remains.   Early this month, the government announced that Mr.Marcos, who is being kept in a refrigerated glass crypt inHawaii, could be buried in his home province of Ilocos Norte.Mrs. Marcos responded that his dying wish was to be buried inManila, but that she would return first anyway.   &quot;It is my hope that my coming home will be the first stepto fulfill my sacred responsibility to bury the remains of mylate husband,&quot; she said in the interview. She said that shedidn't know what sort of reception she would receive onarrival.   Officials in Manila say that despite the many chargesagainst her, Mrs. Marcos won't be arrested as she steps offthe plane. &quot;That would be too dramatic,&quot; says Tomas GomezIII, press secretary to President Corazon Aquino. He saysMrs. Marcos will probably be served with an arrest warrant afew days later and escorted to a court house, where she willbe permitted to post bail.   Mr. Gomez denies that there has been any effort tominimize the publicity surrounding Mrs. Marcos's homecoming,which he considers nearly impossible given the free-wheelingnature of the Philippine media and Mrs. Marcos's penchant forself-promotion.   Nor, he says, is there any need for special surveillance,although like other former first ladies, Mrs. Marcos will begiven a four-man security escort from the Philippine NationalPolice. &quot;She would be too visible to need surveillance of acloak-and-dagger type,&quot; he said.   That casual attitude is a major shift from the fears thatgripped Mrs. Aquino's administration in the first few yearsafter she took power in the February 1986, following apopular revolt that ended two decades of increasinglyauthoritarian rule by the Marcoses.   In the 14 months after Mrs. Aquino became president, hergovernment was shaken by four coup attempts and militarymutinies, three of which were linked to the Marcoses.However, Marcos loyalists haven't been implicated insubsequent destabilization efforts, including a bloody 1989coup attempt, and officials say they no longer consider Mrs.Marcos a national security threat.   On the contrary, with national elections scheduled nextMay, some administration strategists reckon that having Mrs.Marcos on the scene will sow confusion among the opposition,which includes many former Marcos associates who would preferthat voters forget the past.   That won't happen if the government prevails. SolicitorGeneral Francisco Chavez, the government's top lawyer, hasbeen busy filing charges that will generate courtroomheadlines about Mrs. Marcos's alleged involvement in massivecorruption for months, possibly years, to come.   Whether the cases will recover for the impoverishedPhilippines any of the Marcoses' immense wealth, whichgovernment officials have estimated at as much as $10billion, is another question.   Mrs. Marcos said that her U.S. attorney, James Linn, hascautioned her that she may not get a fair trial in thePhilippines. Mr. Linn defended Mrs. Marcos against U.S.federal racketeering charges in a New York City trial thatended in acquittal in July 1990.   Nonetheless, Mrs. Marcos, who maintained in the New Yorktrial that Mr. Marcos was independently wealthy but that sheknew nothing of the details of his business dealings, saidshe was confident that &quot;the truth would prevail&quot; in thePhilippines as well.</TEXT></DOC>
