Therecognition signal for the enzyme is a polypurine-polypyrimidine sequencewhich is at least 9 residues long and rich in G . C base pairs. Suchsequences are present in AAV recombinant plasmids as part of the first15 base pairs of the AAV terminal repeat and in some cases as the resultof cloning the AAV genome by G . C tailing. The isolated enzyme fractiondoes not have significant endonucleolytic activity on single-strandedor double-stranded DNA. Plasmid DNA that is transfected into tissue culturecells is cleaved in vivo to produce a pattern of DNA fragments similarto that seen with purified enzyme in vitro. The activity has been calledendo R for rescue, and its behavior suggests that it may have a rolein recombination of cellular chromosomes.</TEXT></DOC>
