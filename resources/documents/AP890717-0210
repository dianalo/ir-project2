But less than 50 cents on the dollar goes to anyone who isinjured, says Peter W. Huber, a legal scholar, in a report justpublished by the Center for the Study of American Business.   Roughly 60 percent is siphoned off by the system's overhead,according to Huber, adding that ``in most states you would beprosecuted for fraud if you ran a charity with 60 percent overhead.''   That isn't the half of what Hubert, a businessman and attorney inprivate practice, as well as a senior fellow at the ManhattanInstitute for Policy Research, has to say about the system.   Not only does most of the money evade the victim, he says, but itcan be shown that the system does little to improve product safetyand, in fact, might lower it.   On top of this, he adds, it thwarts production of usefulproducts. Small-plane manufacturers, for example, have been sodevastated by liability problems that safety advancements have beenslowed rather than hastened.   ``It would seem that most private pilots have not read the legaltheorists,'' he says, ``because most _ this pilot certainly included_ are begging Washington to cut back on their right to sue.''   The Center, founded by Murray Weidenbaum, chief economic adviserin President Reagan's first term, published Huber's comments afterhe lectured earlier this year at the Washington University School ofLaw, St. Louis. The center is based at the university.   To most people, Huber acknowledged, $1 billion is just a lot ofzeros. But relate the liability insurance cost to the prices ofspecific products and the impact becomes starkly real.   Liability insurance, he contends, is $100 of the cost of a $200football helmet, $20,000 on the $60,000 price of a small plane, $11on a certain childhood vaccine that sells for $12, and $20 on a $100household ladder.   The insurance payoff to victims _ decimated though it is byoverhead _ is uniquely regressive, he says. It is bad enough that somuch is siphoned off by the system, but the system also rewards therich much better than the poor.   ``Wealthy people get much more insurance of the liability systemthan poor people, because liability covers lost income and,increasingly, such things as `hedonic damages' _ payment for theloss of the pleasures of life,'' Huber says.   ``Donald Trump and Donald Trump's chauffeur pay the sameliability premium when each one buys a stepladder, or a car, or avaccine,'' he continues, ``but the benefits they get are very muchproportional to their quite different wealth and social status.''   Huber is well qualified to address the subject and offerrecommendations _ he holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering aswell as a law degree.   First, he says, we must rebuild and attempt to rely on theprinciples of contracts, ``rediscovering some basic notions likeconsent, assumption of risk and other features of a bilateral,before-the-fact choice.''   If principles of contract are unacceptable, he suggests we mightgive more power to the opinions of prudent, competent experts. Fullcompliance with standards established by such people, he says,should be allowed as a defense.   Finally, he contends that society would be well served ifinsurability were restored to the system by attacking features thathave made many products uninsurable, and because of this, lessavailable to the public.   These include runaway non-economic damages that insurers dare notcover, such as punitive, pain and suffering, etc., and looseinterpretations of cause-effect and scientific evidence.   He suggests far too much reliance is placed on the courts. Toooften the courts are asked to determine liability after the productis sold, sometimes years later. Better, suggests Huber, to defineconditions in advance.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, July 18.</NOTE></DOC>
