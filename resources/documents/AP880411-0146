Reynolds Tobacco Co. advertisement in 1985misrepresented the results of a government study on the effects ofsmoking on health.   In a 4-1 vote, the commission reversed a ruling made last Augustby an administrative law judge who had dismissed the complaint ongrounds that the ad was an editorial and therefore was protected byFirst Amendment guarantees on freedom of speech.   Under Monday's FTC order, Montgomery K. Hyun, the administrativelaw judge who dismissed the complaint, must reconsider his rulingin light of Supreme Court criteria on determining whether anadvertisement is protected by the First Amendment, said DeeEllison, an FTC spokeswoman.   Hyun must determine whether the five-member commission hasjurisdiction in the case, Ellison said.   The FTC staff, in its original complaint filed in June 1986,charged that R.J. Reynolds made false or misleading statements inan advertisement, ``Of Cigarettes and Science,'' which ran fromMarch 1985 to June 1985 by stating that the study, ``providedcredible scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous asthe public or the reader has been led to believe.''   The study, called Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, or MRFIT, was conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Instituteof the National Institutes of Health, said Ellison.   The FTC complaint was based in part on the fact that ``Reynoldsfailed to disclose in the ad that men in the study who quit smokinghad a significantly lower rate of death from heart disease than menwho continued to smoke,'' Ellison said. ``We charged that omissionof that information made the ad deceptive.''   If the case is decided against Reynolds, the commission couldbar the tobacco company from misrepresenting scientific studies butcould not seek monetary penalties, Ellison said.   The company views it as a freedom of speech case.   Floyd Abrams, an attorney representing R.J. Reynolds, said thecompany ``denies that it misrepresented the study. But the basicissue here is who should decide that, the government or the publicas whole.''   ``This advertisement is, in our view, protected by the sameFirst Amendment rights as if it were written by anyone in theworld,'' Abrams said.   Abrams said that although R.J. Reynolds has not yet had a chanceto review the entire ruling, it will consider all its legaloptions, including a possible appeal to the U.S. Court of Appealsin Washington, or asking the commission to stay further proceedingson issue.   Remanding to the case to the administrative law judge, saidAbrams, ``is unneccesary and in flat violation of the FirstAmendment. One would not ask the writer or an op-ed piece why hewrote it.''   FTC chairman Daniel Oliver cast the single dissenting vote onthe case, agreeing with Reynolds that ``it is critical for FirstAmendment purposes that the public, and not the government, decidethe answer to this question.''   The Coalition on Smoking or Health, which had petitioned the FTCto rule against the ad, applauded the new FTC ruling.   Coalition chairman Scott D. Ballin said the decision means ``thefederal government has the power to prevent RJR or any company withcommerical motives from deliberately misleading consumers about thesafety of its products by discussing a made-up scientificcontroversy through advertisements that look like editorials.''   The coalition comprises the American Heart Association, theAmerican Lung Association and the American Cancer Society.   R.J. Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., sells 20 brands ofcigarettes and accounts for about one-third of the U.S. cigarettemarket, according to company statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
