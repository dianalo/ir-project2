Showsthat humic acid macromolecules separated from various natural sourcesare characterized by conformational variability and tend to coagulateinto dense knots at high concentrations, low pH or at sufficiently highionic strength. Calculations carried out indicate that humic acid macromoleculeshave elongated ellipsoidal form (ratio of long to short axis in dilutedhumic acid solution from peat reaches 28:1). Humic acid from peat ischaracterized by higher hydrophily than humic acid from brown coal. 8refs.</TEXT></DOC>
