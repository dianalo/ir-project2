About 750 workers in 75 New Jersey towns are testing acotton-and-spandex support belt made by Ergodyne Corp., St.Paul, Minn. In Coral Gables, Fla., trash handlers and othershave used the belt since 1987; the city cut averageback-ailment costs to $800 from $50,000 in the first year,and eliminated lost work from backaches.</LP><TEXT>   A fourth of worker compensation costs for 207 New Jerseycommunities are back-injury-related, says Public Entity RiskManagement Administration, a private manager of municipalinsurance funds; four of the six Moonachie, N.J., publicworks employees were out with back problems in 1990. Backinjuries will represent &quot;the vast majority&quot; of workerailments to be addressed by an OSHA &quot;ergonomics&quot; pushstarting late this year, a spokesman says.   Other solutions tried by many U.S. firms involveredesigning work stations, buying rolling carts for employeesto carry heavy objects, and holding classes on heavy lifting.                                                                                                          CLAMOR GROWS for a better federal commuter tax break.   A dozen bills are pending in Congress to raise theincome-tax credit given mass-transit riders foremployer-subsidized commuting. Most would lift the credit,currently $15 a month, as high as $100 a month. The ChicagoAssociation of Commerce and Industry says the legislationwould help cut traffic congestion and air pollution.   The group says the current transit benefit, set in 1984,is too low to spur employers to offer it. The IRS proposes toboost the tax-free limit by $6 a month, but the AmericanPublic Transit Association says that's just a &quot;band-aid.&quot;Employer-paid parking isn't taxable at all, and employers geta tax deduction for the full subsidy, often well over $100 amonth.                                                                                                          EMPLOYERS AGONIZE over national health-policy issues.   Charles Anderson, vice president of Encore Computer inFort Lauderdale, Fla., reluctantly concludes that &quot;you haveto turn to the government&quot; for national health insurance --at least for those who can't pay. Big auto makers also favora national health policy, perhaps a Canadian-type plan. Whilemost firms polled by the Washington Business Group on Healthwant employers to continue being the main providers of healthcoverage, 37% would change that view if costs keep soaring.   Eaton Corp. says the government should leave cost-cuttingto private firms. Linda Carpenter, Family Dollar Stores'benefits manager, says she doesn't want the governmentinvolved; she urges employers, doctors and hospitals tofoster worker illness prevention. Even so, she favors federaltax breaks for benefits and government coverage for peoplecompanies don't insure.   Senate Democrats will offer a bill tomorrow to requireemployers to provide benefits or pay taxes into a pool forthe uninsured.                                                                                                          DO-IT-YOURSELF: Female heads of households are more likelyto do their own moving than male counterparts, says RyderTruck Rental. Nearly 82% of the households headed by womenthat moved last year used either a rental or borrowed truck,while only 75% of male-headed families were self movers, astudy for Ryder showed.                                                                                                          KING IN, COLUMBUS OUT: The Texas Legislature makes MartinLuther King Day in January a state holiday, but scrapsColumbus Day. Blacks are pleased, but Italian-Americans andHispanics (Columbus sailed for Spain's Queen Isabella) cryfoul. Just 19% of U.S. employers surveyed by Business andLegal Reports offer King Day off.                                                                                                          LOWER SIGHTS: Only 3.5% of 443 college graduates surveyedby consultant Right Associates expect a job paying over$35,000, compared to 9% a year ago; 3.3% now expect to earnunder $15,000, compared to none in 1990. Over half fear therecession will hurt their job prospects, and a hefty 81% planadvanced study this fall.                                                                                                          A LITTLE LEARNING about AIDS can be dangerous.   A study of 530 workers in Georgia found that those givenAIDS education that ran under two hours were more leery ofworking with AIDS sufferers than were people who got moreinstruction or none at all. Short sessions may focus ondisease-transmission details and neglect social and emotionalfactors, says David Herold, Georgia Tech professor oforganizational behavior.   Only 10% of employees attended longer courses; 45% gotbrochures and 30% short courses. Programs taught byoutsiders, who often are seen as less credible, may raiseintolerance especially. But Jonathan Segal, a Philadelphiamanagement lawyer, argues in Human Resources magazine thatemployers should use outside experts to help distance bossesfrom the sensitive issue.   Mr. Segal agrees, however, that mishandled AIDS education&quot;will cause the employer as many problems as it solves.&quot;                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Amid protests, Bell Atlantic's seven phonecompanies shelve the idea of paying 20,000 managementemployees monthly instead of weekly or biweekly. . . .
