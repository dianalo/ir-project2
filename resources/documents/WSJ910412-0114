After a tense few minutes, the alert passes.</LP><TEXT>   This is Big Business, Desert Storm style. Mr. al-Shaheenis planning, negotiating and completing the contracts thatwill put a liberated Kuwait on the road to physical andeconomic recovery. The genial, 43-year-old architect and ateam of 40 Kuwaiti engineers and civil servants are workingflat out to plan the first 90 days after liberation.   Mr. al-Shaheen says Kuwait may need to spend $800 millionto $1 billion in those 90 days to restore basic services --food, water and sanitation -- and to start putting out some500 oil-field fires. The Kuwaitis also will assess damage tooil installations and to Kuwait City, where Iraqi troopsreportedly engaged in destruction of government offices,hotels and other buildings. Aid workers are preparing toreach the city as early as this morning.   The subsequent refurbishment and rebuilding work couldcost as much as $60 billion and possibly more -- by far thelargest construction project for several decades. It willdwarf the current behemoth project, the tunnel under theEnglish Channel. U.S. engineers are comparing the job ofrebuilding Kuwait City, where at least three-fourths of theemirate's nearly two million people lived, to what it wouldtake to reconstruct Phoenix, Ariz.   Even veterans of previous military campaigns are astoundedby the scale of the job and the get-to-work atmosphere here.&quot;I helped in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, and I took ateam down to Panama after the invasion, but I have never seenanything quite like this,&quot; says Wynne Fuller, a civilianexpert attached to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers team.   The prospect of this immense reconstruction project hasset off a scramble for Kuwaiti contracts -- especially at atime when many companies, in the U.S. and abroad, are seeingdomestic orders dwindle. Hundreds of companies are herefighting for a piece of the action. Others are doing battlevia fax and telex rather than make the long, overland slogfrom Riyadh to Dammam, which is in eastern Saudi Arabia. Thedaily correspondence to the Kuwaiti group is piled nearly afoot high; on one day, it includes a draft recovery plan fromStone andamp; Webster Inc., faxes from U.S. law firms and anelaborate proposal from Magnum Fire andamp; Safety Systems. &quot;It'sthis way every day,&quot; Mr. al-Shaheen says.   The early winners of Kuwaiti contracts are American. Mr.al-Shaheen says Kuwait has concluded more than 200 contractsfor reconstruction-related work, with 70% of them going tomany of America's largest companies. Mr. al-Shaheen says thetotal of contracts let so far tops $800 million.   In an interview yesterday, he disclosed some new ones.General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. haveall won $10 million-plus orders for motor vehicles, and theAmerican La France unit of Figgie International Inc. willsupply fire trucks.   In addition, Bechtel Group is helping lead a team of eightconsulting engineers who will work on restoring the Kuwaitioil industry, and the company is project manager for the Gulfoil-spill cleanup.   Caterpillar Inc. has already shipped diesel-fueledelectrical generators for emergency power and is seekingextensive contracts to supply heavy construction equipment.O'Brien Goins Simpson Inc., of Midland, Texas, has won acontract to coordinate the work of four companies that willextinguish fires and clean up damage at Kuwaiti refineries.Motorola Inc. will supply emergency communications gear. AndRaytheon Co., the maker of the Scudbusting Patriot missile,got a $5.7 million contract for runway lights andair-traffic-control equipment for Kuwait's airport.   The number of contracts going to U.S. companies hassparked griping about Americans being favored as a payoff fortheir military effort. Already, the British are angry atbeing frozen out by a short, surprise deadline imposed by theU.S. Army engineers for some bidding.   Nevertheless, the British are giving it the old-schooltry. Their embassy has established a special team at theirconsulate to help U.K. companies obtain contracts. Recentlyvisiting here were six British executives and diplomatsrepresenting the Crown Agents supply organization and W.S.Atkins Co., a big consulting firm.   France has been slow in dispatching executives to vie forKuwaiti contracts, and now the French are worried that theyare about to miss out. Their pessimism is increased by thefact that, historically, they had concentrated their effortson Iraq and left British and American companies practically afree run in other Gulf countries.   Some other members of the coalition, such as theEgyptians, believe that, having fielded armies to liberateKuwait, they ought to play an economic role in its rebirth.&quot;Egyptians don't want just menial jobs this time,&quot; saysHedayat Abdul Nabi, a Cairo journalist. &quot;We have constructionfirms and trading companies, too. Why can't we participate?&quot;   But Kuwaitis say they have long had strong American tiesand want that partnership to continue. Aramco, theArabian-American oil giant, is a big employer here. AndDammam is the closest thing to America in the Mideast; peopleshop at Safeway, drive Chevrolets, buy insurance from ArabianCigna and go to Baskin-Robbins for ice cream.   &quot;We are not opening new doors. The Americans were alreadyhere,&quot; Mr. al-Shaheen says. &quot;One of the Bechtel people livedin Kuwait for three years. They already have contracts withus. Also, the U.S. clearly has the ability to move massiveamounts of equipment and material quickly. One of ourclothing suppliers is getting materials from five, 10 states-- shoes, suits, shirts. No other country can do thatovernight.&quot; He rejects criticism that the favoritism is amatter of Kuwaiti money in return for American blood. &quot;No,not true. This is only a very modest way to say thank you toa people who took a moral stand.&quot;   Surprisingly, the Japanese are almost invisible, either atthe Oberoi or on the list of contractors. Mr. al-Shaheennotes their lukewarm contribution to the war. &quot;We feel theyreally haven't taken as firm a stand as they should have,&quot; hesays. &quot;This isn't a situation where you can choose on aneconomic basis. You have to take a moral stand.&quot; However, hedoesn't rule out a Japanese role in the eventual rebuilding.   Rather than applying directly to the Kuwaitis, someJapanese conglomerates are pursuing joint ventures with majorU.S. construction and engineering companies, an Americanexecutive says. He says they assume they can't win jobsthemselves.   The Germans, whose support for the war has also beenlargely financial, are doing somewhat better. Mostly, theyhave won contracts to replace items that they had previouslysupplied.   South Koreans, who built many roads, factories and powerstations in Iraq and Kuwait, sent a fact-finding team toscout out postwar contracts last weekend.   The scramble for business also is sparking competition --and some complaints -- among American companies. &quot;There is alot of jockeying going on,&quot; says Robert Cooke, president ofPerkins andamp; Will's international division, which has donedesign work on hospitals, schools and public buildings inGulf countries for three decades.   Some construction officials complain that Bechtel will geta lot of Kuwaiti work because former U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz, who is on Bechtel's board, has close ties tothe Bush administration. Bechtel is negotiating for themultibillion-dollar job of overseeing the rebuilding ofKuwait's petrochemical facilities. However, the companydenies having any special influence with Kuwaiti officials.   Some U.S. companies, while also disavowing any favoritism,expect Kuwaiti business simply because they built what hasbeen destroyed. The M.W. Kellogg engineering unit of DresserIndustries built and staffed the world's largest liquefiedpetroleum gas plant at Mina Al-Ahmadi, on the Persian Gulf,and foresees a major role there once the war ends.   And not only big companies are trying to get into the act.In a warehouse on the outskirts of Chicago, Kirby A. Kemp, a32-year-old salesman, shows off miles of electrical wire thathe hopes to sell when he jets off to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, inthe next few weeks. &quot;This is my chance for a career deal,&quot;says Mr. Kemp, a salesman at Delta Wire andamp; Cable, which hasfewer than 20 employees. &quot;It's like the Super Bowl.&quot;   State officials, too, are busy. Worried that bigCalifornia companies will get the reconstruction work,Oregon's state-funded economic-development agency has beengiving small businesses tips on getting Kuwaiti business.&quot;There is a real fear among some that they might already betoo late,&quot; says Philip S. Hirsch, regional director of theagency, the Oregon Marketplace. More than 200 smallbusinesses in Oregon have sent letters hawking their wares toKuwaiti officials.   In addition, some Kuwaiti businessmen are trying to formventures with U.S. partners to ship everything from car partsto breakfast cereal to their own country.   The scramble at Hotel Oberoi gives new meaning to the term&quot;corporate warfare.&quot; Steely nerves are required to negotiatebusiness deals while the Scuds are flying. Twice each night-- and often in early morning -- a wakeup call comes in theform of a Scud alert. The skills required here really aren'ttaught at Harvard Business School -- such as networking inthe bomb shelter. As the sirens go off at about 9 p.m.,several hundred guests head downstairs. &quot;I am getting tiredof this,&quot; one grumbles.   The businessmen, Kuwaiti officials and soldiers go throughthe kitchen to a large basement room furnished with plastictables and chairs. At several tables, camouflage-cladofficers from the Army Corps of Engineers continue a meetingon how to set up a police force to keep order in a liberatedKuwait City. Nearby, Kuwaitis in gray &quot;dishdashas&quot; talk dealswith businessmen in European-cut suits.   &quot;This is a wonderful place to meet people. All thebusiness world is here,&quot; says Rafik Husseini. An executivewith Arabian Commercial Services, a Saudi trading company,Mr. Husseini has signed several deals to supply food andother resources to Kuwait. &quot;It's a very good time to dobusiness, very good,&quot; he says. Adds Ebrahim al Salem, acomputer specialist: &quot;At first, people did find it difficultto concentrate. But now we continue talking about whatever wewere discussing upstairs.&quot;   Mr. al-Shaheen, for all his power, is a man caught in themiddle. Pestered by businessmen and pressured to quicklyimprove conditions inside Kuwait, he and his team arestretched thin. Businessmen have criticized the committee forbeing inaccessible, disorganized and vague about thestandards for proposals.   Mr. al-Shaheen concedes things aren't running as smoothlyas in a normal office, but he says, &quot;This is not a normalsituation.&quot; Adds Ahmad al-Osami, his secretary: &quot;Everyonekeeps asking what the procedure is, how do we handle things.But they don't realize, there is no `system.' We have toimprovise as we go along.&quot;   On the Oberoi's 22nd floor, six phones are ringing atonce. The entry way is crowded with men in business suits,camouflage fatigues and Arab gowns. Down the hall, ascribbled note says Room 2210 is the Ministry of PublicWorks. Room 2207 is Ministry of the Interior. At the end ofthe hall, in the royal suite, Mr. al-Shaheen sits behind alarge desk. His two in-baskets are overflowing with telexesand faxes. A pile of messages and papers awaits hissignature. There is a huge map of Kuwait City and eightsmaller ones showing how the city will be divided into eightemergency districts immediately after liberation.   A lot is at stake in Mr. al-Shaheen's plans. A hugereconstruction program is the only way for Kuwait to restoreits oil industry. The country has lost an estimated $5.2billion in oil revenue since the Iraqi invasion and has hadto tap an undisclosed amount of its overseas assets, whichbefore the conflict were estimated at $100 billion. Oilaccounted for more than 90% of Kuwait's export revenue and40% of its gross domestic product.   The reconstruction may be so expensive partly because theKuwaitis seem to want to build a nation that is lessdependent on foreign labor. Foreigners had made up most ofKuwait's work force. Many were Palestinians, and Kuwaitissuspect them of collaborating with the Iraqi army. Someexiled businessmen are saying they won't use them anymore.   How will Kuwait finance reconstruction? Reparations fromhighly indebted Iraq are probably wishful thinking. Ratherthan liquidate overseas assets further, Kuwait may try to tapthe credit markets, according to the Kuwait InvestmentAuthority's chief, Abdullah al-Gabandi. But the cost of suchborrowing will be based on the country's ability to get itsoil fields operating quickly -- something that is far fromcertain. It's also uncertain whether the government will payto rebuild the country's damaged private sector and how fastit may strengthen its armed forces.   &quot;All these are big questions, and none of them haveanswers yet,&quot; says a London banker who deals with theKuwaitis.   ---   Thomas M.
