(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IBM Model 55 SX The IBM Model 55 SX is one of the range of PS/2 computersproduced by IBM, which distinguish themselves from their AT counterparts byutilising the MCA bus.andP;  The Model 55 has a 16MHz 80386SX processor at itsheart, which provides sure if not speedy computing power.andM;It can hold up to 4Mb RAM on the system board.andP;  The review machine came with2Mb -- any more requires the installation of an expansion card that can holda further 12Mb.andP;  The review model came equipped with a 60Mb hard disk,although a smaller 30Mb unit is available.andM;It's an attractive machine, compact in design and in consequence, lessexpandable.andP;  IBM provides three expansion slots, mounted horizontally on acarrier, which accounts for the low height of the system box, but it doesrestrict the number of cards the machine can carry.andM;This is less of a problem than it might seem, as the VGA, serial and parallelports and mouse port are located on the system board, leaving the three emptyslots free for extras such as an internal modem, network adaptor or increasedmemory.andM;Getting inside is simple -- you simply undo two screws and lift the lid off.andO;The entire unit can be reduced to its component parts with just onescrewdriver -- and that's only required to undo the exterior retainingscrews, everything else just snaps apart easily.andM;The solidly constructed system box is around 4 inches high and has a 16-inchsquare footprint.andP;  IBM may not produce the fastest computers in the world,but they're extremely well put together and rigorously tested on one of themost sophisticated assembly facilities in Europe.andP;  Unfortunately, they'revery expensive, especially when compared to similar machines.andM;Compaq -- not exactly in the bargain basement -- and Dell which providesexcellent value for money, both supply backup and support comparable to IBMs,and their part costs are significantly cheaper.andP;  They also produce their80386SX machines with an AT bus, which might be felt by some to be a positiveadvantage.andM;The IBM keyboard is one of the best available, with a light and positive feelto the action.andP;  It's robustly constructed, capable of withstanding heavy use.andM;A variety of IBM VGA monitors are available and the review machine came withan 8513 monitor which had an adequate 12-inch colour display.andP;  The machinehad a 3-1/2-inch high density disk drive: an external 5-1/4-inch drive isalso available but it's an expensive add-on to an already costly system.andM;This is a workmanlike machine that can be relied upon for day-to-day use, andit has been well received by large corporates.andP;  There's nothing fancy aboutit, but that's not IBM's style...the price is.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
