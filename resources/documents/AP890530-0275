Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the decision to raisethe rate effective Wednesday resulted from the bank's desire tostem inflation and strengthen the yen, which has fallen against theU.S. dollar in recent months.   Commercial bank interest rates will rise in mid-June, officialssaid.   Sumita told a news conference that the rate hike was a``precaution'' to stem inflationary threats and stabilize prices.   The discount rate, the interest rate the central bank chargescommercial banks, has stood at 2.5 percent _ the lowest level ofany industrialized nation _ since February 1987.   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama called the bank's decision ``atimely measure'' and said Japan should continue to watch prices,``especially the effects of the lower yen exchange rate and higheroil prices.''   Eishiro Saito, chairman of the powerful Japan Federation ofEconomic Organizations (Keidanren), said the rate hike wasunnecessary but perhaps unavoidable ``because of the need tostabilize exchange rates and maintain coordination with othercountries.''   The long-term prime lending rate is expected to rise by 0.20 to0.30 percentage points in late June, analysts say.   Rates on Japan's overseas loans may rise as well, althoughlow-interest development loans are less likely to be affected, saida Bank of Japan official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Hirokazu Yoshida of Sanwa Bank said the increase would havelittle impact on currency trading because the market had been wellprepared by media speculation about the rise.   ``Even when the speculation first began, it didn't give much ofa psychological boost to the yen,'' he said. ``If it didn't workthen, it won't work now.''   Finance Minister Murayama said hikes in commercial bank interestrates would go into effect June 19.   Money in regular savings account will earn 0.38 percent interestper year, up from 0.26 percent, he said.   In recent years the Bank of Japan has followed a policy oflow-interest rates to encourage economic growth and slow theearlier rapid appreciation of the yen.   The discount rate peaked at 9.0 percent in 1980 in an attempt bythebank to halt skyrocketing consumer prices during an inflationarywave.   Since then, the bank consistently lowered the rate until thedecision on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
