You intimate that Far West's arbitrage did not work, andthat its supposed lack of success led to the governmenttaking over the bank, &quot;sticking the government&quot; with largelosses. You quote the regulators that &quot;the arbitrage programfailed to produce the anticipated results.&quot; The facts do notsupport that conclusion.</LP><TEXT>   The program was projected to earn 0.92% per year andactually earned 1.21% ($5.5 million) and 1% ($10.7 million)in 1988 and 1989, respectively, the only two years it wasallowed to run without government interference. Unlike the&quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; arbitrages operated by some otherinstitutions, Far West's conservatively run arbitrage was anunqualified success, as the uncontradicted facts demonstrate.   There is no relationship between the success or purported&quot;disappointment&quot; of the arbitrage and the takeover of thebank. The real reason for Far West's demise was thegovernment's decision not to honor a contract it entered intoin 1987, under which it induced a group of private investorsto recapitalize Far West, which had suffered massive lossesunder prior management.   As U.S. District Judge Owen Panner has concluded in alawsuit brought by the bank and its investors against thegovernment, the government breached our agreement. That iswhat caused the takeover of the bank.   There will be large losses to the government in resolvingthe Far West situation, but the success of the arbitrage hasin fact substantially reduced the cost. In fact, the ultimateloss will be reduced by more than $100 million as a directresult of the investors' recapitalization of Far West in whatyou called our &quot;grand experiment.&quot; More than one-half of thisimprovement is reflected in the increase of the tangiblecapital position of Far West since its recapitalization.   Donald L.Tisdel   Former President and CEO   Far West Federal Bank   Portland, Ore.   ---   Your article about risk-controlled arbitrage contributingto Sandamp;L losses incorrectly stated that U.S. District JudgeDale E. Saffels &quot;headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ofTopeka and thus was responsible for supervising Franklin{Savings Association}.&quot; Judge Saffels served as the bank'schairman from January 1978 to November 1979, but neither henor any other director had any responsibility for supervisingthe bank's member institutions.   During Judge Saffels's term as chairman, supervisoryauthority rested with the president, who also served asprincipal supervisory agent and who reported directly to thechairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington,with regard to regulatory matters. Additionally, Franklin didnot even engage in risk-controlled arbitrage until the early1980s, long after Judge Saffels had resigned from the bank'sboard of directors.   Historically, the bank's directors have been responsiblefor setting policies and ensuring fiscal responsibility. Evenwhen the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka had supervisoryauthority for thrift institutions prior to passage of theFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Actof 1989, directors were denied access to all regulatoryinformation, let alone allowed to act in any enforcementcapacity. As chairman of the bank, Judge Saffels would havebeen familiar with Franklin's financial activities, but hewould not have been privy to its regulatory record or in anyway responsible for wielding any influence over itsoperations.
