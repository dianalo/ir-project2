Among other things, the Hunts were accused by federal Judge Edward Weinfeld of embarking upon &quot;a campaign of obstruction to impede and defeat&quot; a three-member arbitration panel deciding parts of the case.    The judge also upheld a previous finding that the Hunts pay $3.5 million in attorneys' fees as part of a larger settlement.    &quot;The Hunts have only themselves to blame for the excessive costs&quot; of the court fight, declared Judge Weinfeld in a 78-page opinion. The judge defended the arbitration panel, marveled at the 13,671 pages of transcript from the panel's hearings and said he only hoped the case would become an example of how not to fight an arbitration award.    Judge Weinfeld's opinion formally confirms the findings of an arbitration panel, made up of a law professor and two lawyers. The panel was formed in 1981 to settle the second part of the Hunts' lawsuit. The lawsuit accused the oil companies of breaking a 1971 agreement designed to help the Hunts and the oil companies offset oil production cutbacks by Libya.    Following an eight-week trial in 1978, Judge Weinfeld dismissed the Hunts' antitrust claims. But he ordered the arbitration panel to decide separate breach-of-contract claims.    What followed, Judge Weinfeld said, was a series of actions by the Hunts &quot;which, understated, can best be described as 'nit-picking.'&quot; The Hunts accused the panel members of various instances of &quot;misconduct,&quot; none of which the court said had merit.    Finally, after 61 arbitration hearings from 1981 to 1985, the panel ordered the Hunts to pay $3.9 million to five of the oil companies, including $2.6 million to Mobil Corp., and ordered three other companies to pay $1.6 million to the Hunts. The $3.5 million in legal fees assessed against the Hunts was part of the calculations. </TEXT></DOC>
