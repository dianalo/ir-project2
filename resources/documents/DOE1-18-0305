A comparison is made between the spectraltime-scales for two-body thermalization and cooling at different pairenergies, and it is found that the formation of the thermal tail is suppressedunder certain conditions that are established, and that correspond tovery efficient cooling. The loss of the tail would then lead to the lossof the higher energy component of X-ray and {gamma}-ray emission in thermalmodels for compact objects such as {gamma}-ray burst sources and activegalactic nuclei. This spectral approach to the problem of thermalizationcomplements previous treatments that consider time-scales averaged overall pair energies.</TEXT></DOC>
