Because our word processor (Software Publishing'sOfficeWriter) has a search function.andM;If a user needs a letter he wrote two years ago to Vance Vip about a contractdispute, he searches for the appropriate phrases and the word processordisplays a list of all the documents that mention Vance and the contract.andM;Document-management utilities such as Magellan, which make it easy to erasefiles, also make it very tempting to keep them.andP;  Magellan can search allfiles for a particular phrase.andM;So LAN managers need help.andP;  For the short term, we need to know what'shappening to the disk space we have; for the long term, we need more creativestorage alternatives.andM;Ideally, your LAN operating system should let you allocate space bydirectory, by user, by group or by any combination thereof.andP;  It should alsopermit you to exclude &quot;public&quot; areas, such as databases or spool space, fromdisk-space allocations.andM;The &quot;last access date&quot; that NetWare keeps for files would be extremely usefulif tape-management software respected it.andP;  But, with the exception ofPalindrome, tape software changes the last access date when it backs up thefile.andP;  If you back up regularly, there's no way to tell a user he or shehasn't used that file in five years, or even looked at it.andM;We need tools that tell us how disk space is being used.andP;  Although severalthird-party vendors make such utilities for NetWare, they generally share twofailings: One, they don't help you track historical usage so you can identifyusers who never erase files; and two, they don't provide flat-file output soyou can easily build your own historical database.andM;For the longer term, we will need more and cheaper storage devices.andP;  I dreamabout a three-tiered data-storage system for active, inactive and historicalfiles.andM;Active files would be kept on large, fast hard disks in LAN servers.andO;Inactive files would be kept on slower, less expensive devices.andP;  Backups andhistorical files would be kept on WORM drives or tape.andP;  And users would beable to treat all the media as LAN drives.andM;With appropriate technology, the LAN manager could handle data transfertransparently.andP;  Inactive files would automatically be moved from faster toslower media, but a pointer would remain on the server disk.andP;  When usersaccessed a transferred file, the operating system would know it was on adifferent medium, tell the user it was in storage and then retrieve it.andM;The secondary and historical storage devices would have to be easy to augmentand retrieve from.andP;  That means jukebox systems of platters or tapes withautomatic retrieval mechanisms.andP;  They must be designed to grow so they arecost-effective on both small and large networks.andP;  Indeed, automatic units maybe even more important on the smaller LANs: A large, centrally managednetwork might be able to afford a full-time tape librarian to mount plattersor tapes, but smaller ones can't.andM;Entrepreneurs, forget about the next killer app.andP;  There's a huge marketwaiting for sophisticated file-management software and hardware.andM;----------Diane Danielle manages an extensive LAN for one of the country's largest bankholding companies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
