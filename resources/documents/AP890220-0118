TATRO</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer_</UNK><DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union on Monday invited Egypt'spresident to Moscow and scheduled meetings in the Egyptian capitalwith Israel and the PLO in quest of a Middle East peace conference.   But Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told reporters after 90minutes of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that theymade no progress on the key obstacle blocking a peace conference _Israel's refusal to sit with the PLO.   Cairo was the focus of new peace efforts with the arrival Sundaynight of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who is on afive-nation Middle East tour.   He gave Mubarak a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,extending an ``official and friendly invitation'' for the Egyptianleader to visit Moscow.   The message included ``some important presentation regarding aMiddle East settlement,'' Shevardnadze said in Russian through anArabic interpreter. He did not elaborate.   After chastising Israel earlier for adopting a ``stubbornposition,'' Shevardnadze was scheduled to meet with Arens in Cairoon Wednesday. There was a strong possibility he would meet with PLOChairman Yasser Arafat separately on the same day.   Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressedthe Soviet and Israeli positions were not so far apart that theycould not be bridged on the subject of an international peaceconference.   Shevardnadze proposed in Damascus, Syria, on Saturday that theU.N. Security Council's five permanent members convene a preparatoryconference within nine months to arrange for Arab-Israelinegotiations.   Israel has said it would agree to preparatory talks, sponsored bythe Soviet Union and the United States, before direct negotiationsbetween Israel and its Arab neighbors. It has said the UnitedNations also may play a role.   However, Israel has refused to talks with the PLO, which itcontends is a terrorist organization bent on destroying the Jewishstate.   Asked if progress was made in his talks with Mubarak on theissue, Arens said: ``on the PLO there is no progress now.''   But Arens described his talks with Mubarak as ``a very goodexchange of views'' that took place in a cordial atmosphere.   Egypt's Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid called on Israel toconsider ``with an open mind and open heart'' the possibility oftalking to the PLO. The Palestinians, he told reporters after themeeting, have shown ``a greater deal of flexibility and a great dealof understanding.''   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an unusuallyupbeat statement that he hoped Arens' meetings with Mubarak andShevardnadze would foretell a breakthrough in the stagnatedIsraeli-Egyptian relations and a normalization of Israeli-Sovietties.   ``Maybe we are entering a more intensive stage in the Middle Eastpeace process,'' Shamir said in an interview broadcast on Israelradio's Arabic service.   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the 1967Middle East war, and Israel has said the Soviet Union may getinvolved in the peace process only on the condition that it resumeties with Israel.   The Soviets and Israelis have permanent but low-level diplomaticmissions in each other's country but are represented by embassies ofFinland and the Netherlands.   Shevardnadze, who first flew to Jordan and Syria, is to visitIraq and Iran before returning home Feb. 27.   He is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Jordan and isthe first high-ranking Soviet official to visit Egypt in 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
