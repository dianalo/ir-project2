Gorbachev's Nobel Prize boosted stock prices in Tokyotoday, brokers said, while the dollar slipped further against theJapanese yen.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 496.90 points, or 2.15percent, closing at 23,606.10. It had gained 3.21 percent, or719.04 points, on Monday.   ``An overall combination of factors contributed to theperformance of the market today,'' said Yasufumi Kawashima of SanyoSecurities Co. He added, however, that buying was leisurely.   News such as Gorbachev's winning the Nobel Peace Prize added toa feeling of stability, he said.   Brokers also mentioned stability on the New York market, loweroil prices and foreign investors' buying of high-tech issues suchas Hitachi Ltd. and insurance shares that had been consideredunder-priced.   Large securities firms were selling aggressively to foreigninvestors, whose purchases moved prices because they were buyingthinly traded issues, the brokers added.   Reports that the long-term prime interest rate may be loweredalso encouraged buying, said Toshiyuki Higuchi of Daiwa SecuritiesCo.   Trade volume on the first section was about 500 million shares,up from 370.7 million shares Monday.   The dollar, meanwhile, closed at 128.05 yen, down 0.10 yen fromMonday's close of 128.15 yen.

The dollar now has fallen 9.90 yen in the last 11 trading days.   ``The factors favoring the rise of the yen have been prevalentrecently. This trend of the yen's stability has been prolonged andencouraged the buying of the yen,'' said an official at the Bank ofTokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   But another dealer at a major bank commented, ``There is adefinite overselling of the dollar. No one thinks the dollar isgoing to plunge, that the U.S. economy is going to be destroyedovernight or that the tools they own are going to become dustovernight.''   He said market players seem to be turning cautious, preparingfor a possible reaction to the overselling.   ``Everything bad there is to say about the dollar has alreadybeen said. It can't hit a further bottom,'' he added.   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds roseto 83.78 points from their close of 83.40 on Monday.
