Comments have been received from eleven parties in response tothat Notice. Comments have been received from the United States ExecutiveAgencies (``Executive Agencies'');\1\<NOTE/> Shippers for Competitive Ocean Transportation (``SCOT'');Campania Sud Americana de Vapores (``CSAV''), Great Lakes TranscaribbeanLine (``GLTL''); Naviera Amazonica Peruana, S.A. (``NAPSA''); NedlloydLines (``Nedlloyd''), Compania Peruana de Vapores (``CPV''), Naviera Neptuno,S.A. (``Neptuno'') and Empresa Naviera Santa, S.A. (``Santa''), jointly(``the Peruvian carriers''); the American Chamber of Commerce of Peru (``Chamber''),Georgetown Steel Corporation (``GSC''); Occidental International Explorationand Production Company (``Occidental''); and Southern Peru Copper Corporation(``SPCC'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Department of Transportation (``DOT'') submitted thesecomments on behalf of the Executive Agencies. In addition, earlier on March3, 1988, the DOT, on its own behalf, submitted a letter to the Commissionreporting on consultations between the United States Government (``USG'')and the Government of Peru (``GOP'') held in Lima on February 25-26, 1988.Those comments and related recent events have been considered by the Commission,as set forth below. Based on those comments, the Commission herein announcesthat this proceeding will be held in abeyance and invites further commentsand information from interested parties by August 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On December 2, 1987, the Commission issued a Final Rule in this proceeding(52 FR 46356, December 7, 1987) stating that it finds ``conditions unfavorableto shipping'' within the meaning of section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant MarineAct, 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b) (``Section 19''), exist in the foreignoceanborne trade between the United States and Peru (``Trade''). The Commissionadvised in its Final Rule that the GOP, through its laws and regulations,imposed burdens on non-Peruvian-flag carriers which are not experiencedby Peruvian-flag carriers. The Commission therefore suspended the tariffsof certain Peruvian-flag carriers in the U.S. trade.The GOP laws and regulations to which the Commission referred in its FinalRule include Supreme Decree No. 009-86-TC \2\<NOTE/> (``Decree 009-86''), which reserves 100 percent of all importedand exported ocean freight generated by Peru's foreign trade for Peruvian-flagcarriers. The amount of cargo reserved by Decree 009-86 for Peruvian-flagcarriers could be reduced: (1) On the basis of strict reciprocity;\3\<NOTE/> (2) pursuant to government or commercial agreements \4\<NOTE/> among non-Peruvian and Peruvian-flag carriers, preferablyinclude CPV, the Peruvian state-owned shipping line; or (3) when the PeruvianDirector General of Maritime Transportation or Peruvian Consuls grant non-Peruvian-flagor non-associate carriers permission to carry Peruvian export or importcargoes. Authorization for the use of non-Peruvian-flag or non-associatecarriers would be granted in the form of a waiver or cargo manifest certificationwhen Peruvian-flag or associate carriers were not available and in positionwithin 12 days \5\<NOTE/> following the proposed date of shipment of non-perishableproducts, or within 4 days in the case of perishable products, or whenno Peruvian-flag carrier serves the relevant port.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Decree 009-86 amended Supreme Decree No. 036-82-TC (``Decree036-82''), effective September 1982. Decree 036-82 reserves Peruvian importand export cargoes for Peruvian-flag vessels and sets out waiver and cargomanifest certification requirements for non-Peruvian-flag carriers. Theexact percentage of cargo reserved for Peruvian-flag carriers is not specifiedin Decree 036-82. An earlier decree states that 50 percent of Peruvianimport and export cargo is reserved for Peruvian-flag carriers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>E.g., </T3>U.S. carriers' access to Peruvian cargoes would be proportionalto Peruvian carriers' access to U.S. cargoes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Non-Peruvian-flag carriers which become parties to suchcommercial agreements may be granted associate status upon approval bythe GOP. Associate carriers are excepted from cargo manifest certificationand waiver requirements under Decree Nos. 009-86 and 036-82.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Supreme Decree No. 033-86-TC modified Decree 009-86 byreducing the number of days a shipment must wait for a Peruvian or associatecarrier from 15 days to 12 days.Subsequent to issuance of the Proposed Rule which initiated this proceeding,\6\<NOTE/> regulations (``Regulations'')\7\<NOTE/> were issued by the GOP pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding(``MOU'') signed by the USG and the GOP on May 1, 1987. These Regulationsset forth new requirements and procedures that shipping lines operatingthird-flag vessels must observe in order to obtain authorizations fromthe GOP Ministry of Transportation and Communications (``Ministry'') toparticipate in the Trade. The GOP advised through the Department of Statethat the ``authorization'' system under the Regulations totally replacedthe existing ``waiver'' system for granting third-flag carriers accessto the Trade.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 52 FR 11832, April 13, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ These Regulations were contained in Ministerial ResolutionNo. 027-87-TC/AC (``Resolution'').In issuing its Final Rule the Commission explained that while it recognizedthe good faith efforts made by the USG and GOP to address the situationin the Trade through diplomatic means, the resultant Regulations whichimplement the MOU did not satisfactorily resolve that situation. The Commissionstated that, in fact, the Regulations, in effect, continue in place thevery types of restrictions and impediments which prompted this proceedingin the first instance. Although third-flag carriers were no longer requiredto obtain ``waivers'' for individual shipments, they were to obtain ``authorizations''to participate in the Trade. The Commission found this authorization processas inconsistent with free access to trade, as was the waiver system itreplaced. In this regard, the Commission also added that it was unknownwhether Chilean-flag carriers would be granted authorizations and allowedto operate in the Trade, particularly in light of the existence of PeruvianResolution No. 044-86-TC/AC (``Resolution 044-86''), which excludes Chilean-flagcarriers from certain Peru/third-country trades. Finally, the Commission advised that it could not accept as a satisfactoryresolution of this matter an accommodation which would permit the GOP todeny authorization to a third-flag operator in the Trade if the countryof nationality of that operator bars participation to Peruvian-flag carriersin any of its third-country trades. The Commission explained that to acceptthe proposition that the GOP can settle disputes with foreign nations byimposing burdens on U.S.-Peru trade hostage to obtaining concessions elsewhere.Thus, the Final Rule suspended the tariffs of the Peruvian-flag carriersoperating in the Trade, with the exception of Naviera Amazonica Peruana,S.A. (``NAPSA''),\8\<NOTE/> unless such carriers obtain authorized status from the Commission.\9\<NOTE/> The suspension of these tariffs was to become effective March7, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Under the Final Rule, NAPSA's tariff, FMC No. 3, coveringthe U.S./Iquitos, Peru trade, would not be suspended because the Commissionfound this subtrade distinguishable from the Trade generally, and, therefore,entitled to different treatment. The Final Rule noted that the Commissiondid not receive any complaints regarding this subtrade. Further, it statedthat there is no alternative to NAPSA's service in this subtrade. (<T3>See </T3>Docket No. 87-6, 52 FR 46362, December 7, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Final Rule states that authorized status shall beconferred upon a Peruvian-flag carrier upon that carrier's submitting tothe Commission a certificate from the GOP stating unequivocally that nolaw, regulation or policy of the GOP will: <ITAG tagnum="28">(i) Preclude any non-Peruvian-flag carrier from competing in the Tradeon the same basis as any other carrier;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(ii) Result in less than meaningful and competitive access by anynon-Peruvian-flag carrier, to cargo designated as reserved under SupremeDecree No. 009-86-TC; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(iii) Impose any administrative burden, including but not limitedto, the necessity to secure an authorization based on the national statusof the carrier, or otherwise discriminate against any non-Peruvian-flagcarrier in the Trade. </ITAG>On February 4, 1988, the Peruvian carriers filed a Petition for Reconsideration(``Petition'') requesting that the FMC reconsider its Final Rule, or, inthe alternative, stay the effective date of the Final Rule on grounds thatthe Rule is basically directed at Decree 009-86 of February 28, 1986, whichhas been rescinded by GOP Supreme Decree No. 004-88-TC (``Decree 004-88'')of January 22, 1988.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Further, the Peruvian carriers submitted that the Regulationswhich implement the MOI also have been rescinded.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Decree 004-88 was published in the Peruvian OfficialGazette, ``El Peruano,'' on January 25, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ In addition, Resolution No. 044-86 which excluded Chilean-flagcarriers from certain Peru/third-country trades has been rescinded. The Peruvian carriers alleged that with such action by the GOP, Peruviancargo preference law has reverted to its status prior to enactment of Decree009-86, and prior to the initiation of this proceeding which resulted fromcomplaints to the Commission about Decree 009-86. They advised that whileDecree 009-86 reserved 100 percent of all Peruvian import and export cargoes,Decree 004-88 reestablishes legislation in existence between 1970 and 1986which reserves 50 percent of Peruvian cargoes to Peruvian-flag or associatecarriers.\12\<NOTE/> The Peruvian carriers took the position that since, as theCommission states in its Final Rule, this proceeding arose from complaintsabout the enactment, implementation and enforcement by the GOP of Decree009-86, the Commission should reconsider its Final Rule and terminate theproceeding due to the rescission of Decree 009-86. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The pre-1986 legal regime is based primarily on Decree036-82. As an alternative to reconsideration and termination of the proceeding,the Peruvian carriers suggested that the Commission stay its Final Rulepending investigation of present conditions in the Trade or judicial review,\13\<NOTE/> whichever is later, particularly if the Commission determinesthat it has insufficient knowledge of present conditions in the Trade toorder termination of the proceeding. The Peruvian carriers contended thata stay would allow time for the Commission to gather any facts requiredfor reconsideration and, if necessary, for the Court to clarify ``seriouslegal issues in this proceeding.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ A petition for review of the Final Rule was filed bythe Peruvian-flag carriers in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit (``Court'') on January 29, 1988, <T3>Compania Peruana de Vapores, et al. v. USA and FMC</T3>, D.C. Cir.No 88-1073. That proceeding has been held in abeyance until May 31, 1988.After analyzing the Petition and replies thereto, the Commission issuedits Notice of Reconsideration of Final Rule (``March Notice''.) In itsMarch Notice the Commission discussed the GOP initiatives, noting thatsome action was necessary to recognize the change status of the issuesbrought about by the GOP's actions and, as a technical legal matter, becausethe rescission of Decree 009-86 and Resolution 044-86 appeared to haveundermined the basis cited in the Final Rule for the Commission's findingsof conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Trade. The Commission withdrewthe Final Rule for reconsideration and again invited interested partiesto comment. However, the Commission also pointed out that rescission alonemay not resolve the unfavorable conditions which the Final Rule addressed,and the Commission stated that, if the system remains discriminatory inthe absence of Decree 009-86, it would be prepared to act swiftly to reinstatethe Final Rule on the basis of new findings that conditions unfavorableto shipping continue to exist. Subsequent to the issuance of the Commission's March Notice, three agreementswere filed with the Commission between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriers.\14\<NOTE/> Pursuant to these agreements, the Chilean-flag carriers wouldbe granted associate status by the GOP and thereby given access to theTrade. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ These agreements are: Agreement No. 212-011180 betweenNeptuno and CSAV, filed March 16, 1988, effective April 30, 1988; AgreementNo. 212-011186, as amended by Agreement No. 212-011186.001, between Santaand Empresa Maritima de Estrado (``Empremar''), filed March 29, 1988, effectiveMay 13, 1988; and Agreement No. 212-011189 between CPV and Compania Chilenade Navegacion Interoceanica, S.A. (``CCNI''), filed April 12, 1988, effectiveMay 27, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>A. Executive Agencies<ITAG tagnum="81">1. March 3, 1988 Letter</ITAG>On March 3, 1988, Gregory Dole, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy andInternational Affairs (``DAS''), DOT, reported to the Commission on consultationsbetween the USG and GOP, held February 25-26, 1988, regarding the GOP'simplementation of Decree 036-82. DAS Dole reports that the GOP providedassurances that U.S. carriers will, through their equal access agreement,continue to have access to all cargo in the Trade on the same basis asPeruvian-flag carriers. Further, the DAS reports that the GOP had approved,by Ministerial Resolution of February 22, 1988, three agreements betweenPeruvian and Chilean-flag carriers which will accord Chilean-flag carriersaccess to all cargo on the same basis as Peruvian-flag carriers. The DASstates that, if the terms of these commercial agreements are acceptable,the Executive Agencies believe that the agreements will resolve the problemsthat the Chilean-flag carriers have had gaining access to the Trade. Inaddition, the DAS notes that during the consultations, the USG expressedhope to the GOP that similar commercial solutions would be found for otherthird-flag carriers to allow them to operate without restrictions. Further, DAS Dole submits that the GOP indicated that the administrationof the Peruvian waiver system was being evaluated so as to create a systemwith maximum flexibility. In addition, the FMC was advised that the GOPhas set up a commission to review GOP merchant marine policy. The DAS reports that the Executive Agencies are generally encouraged bythe developments in the Trade, but states that it is premature for themto make a recommendation as to the disposition of the Final Rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. March 31, 1988 Comments</ITAG>The Executive Agencies state that as of the final day of the comment periodtwo service agreements between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriers had beenfiled with the FMC. They submit that these agreements appear to providethese Chilean-flag carriers access to the Trade. The Executive Agenciespoint out, however, that the access of other third-flag carriers to theTrade is uncertain. Further, the Executive Agencies report that they received assurances thatthird-flag carrier access to the Trade, as well as other issues, will beaddressed over the next few months by the Commission established to developa new Peruvian merchant marine policy. Based on the aforementioned developments, the Executive Agencies statethat they do not believe sanctions are warranted at this time.  B. SCOT  SCOT contends that while the GOP's rescission of Decree 009-86 and theResolution are positive steps, such action will not remove the conditionsunfavorable to shipping in the Trade. SCOT adds, however, that as of March31, 1988, none of the changes implemented by the GOP will have been inplace for sufficient time to allow U.S. shippers to comment on their effecton the Trade.  SCOT states that three agreements between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriershave been approved by the GOP. It comments on the agreement between CSAVand Neptuno, the only agreement which had been filed with the FMC at thetime SCOT drafted its comments. SCOT argues that the provisions of theCSAV-Neptuno service agreement do not appear to provide effective competitionby the Chilean-flag carrier in the Trade. Further, SCOT believes that theagreement raises the question of whether any third-flag carrier would begiven associate status without granting serious commercial concessions.The fact that CSAV can no longer participate in the profits of the U.S./Perutrade pursuant to the agreement, is said to indicate that CSAV's priceof admission to the Trade was significant. SCOT contends that the conditionsunder which CSAV was readmitted will not remove unfavorable conditionsas far as Chilean carriers are concerned.  Given the legislative regime now in place and the agreement between CSAVand Neptuno, SCOT maintains that conditions unfavorable to shipping inthe Trade continue to exist and that no evidence submitted to date indicatesotherwise. SCOT states that it would be premature for the Commission totake any action to stay or discontinue the investigation. It submits, however,that shippers would like an opportunity to comment further on conditionsin the Trade after sufficient time has passed to allow them to assess GOPactions. A minimum of 90 days is said to be required to obtain any meaningfulexperience.  C. CSAV  CSAV directs the Commission's attention to its commercial agreement withNeptuno which has been approved by the GOP and filed with the FMC. CSAVreports that this agreement renders CSAV an associate carrier for purposesof Decree 036-82.  CSAV takes the position, therefore, that should the Commission determinethat commercial settlements have made it desirable to suspend the proceedingand the Final Rule, it would have no formal objection to such action atthis time. CSAV suggests, however, that it would be beneficial to shippersfor the Commission to make a statement that its Final Rule could be reimposedin the event that new obstacles are placed on operations in the Trade orif the commercial settlements prove unworkable.  D. GLTL  GLTL states that it is meeting with CPV on April 20, 1988, to discuss potentialcooperation and the terms of a free access agreement for cargoes movingbetween U.S. Great Lakes ports and Peru. GLTL advises that such a commercialagreement would confer associate status upon it and would resolve the concernsit previously raised in this proceeding. Absent such an agreement, GLTLasserts that its cargoes in the Trade would be subject to vessel manifestcertificaton and waiver requirements pursuant to Decree 036-82.  It, therefore, requests that the Commission hold any further action inabeyance for a reasonable period of time to permit negotiations betwenCPV and GLTL and a determination as to the approvability of any agreement.GLTL states that it will promptly notify the Commission of the resultsof the April 20, 1988 negotiations.  GLTL subsequently informed the Commission by letter dated May 11, 1988that representatives of GLTL and CPV had discussed the ``framework fora proposed commercial agreement which, if approved by the Government ofPeru and by the Commission, would confer associate status upon GLTL * ** and would resolve the concerns previously raised by GLTL in this proceeding.''GLTL stated its expectation that a formal agreement would be concludedfollowing action by CPV's Board of Directors on the proposal. GLTL alsoinformed the Commission in that letter that the Peruvian Government hasrecently reaffirmed fines imposed on GLTL in connection with cargo carriedin the Trade in 1984, and that imposition of these fines is being appealedthrough litigation in Peru.\1\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ GLTL's May 11, 1988 letter to the Commission was filedsubsequent to the closing date of March 31, 1988 for the filing of commentsin this proceeding. GLTL's comments filed on March 31, 1988, however, statedthat a meeting of GLTL and CPV representatives was expected to occur onApril 20, 1988 and that GLTL would promptly inform the Commission of theoutcome of that meeting. The Commission therefore has accepted the May11, 1988 letter which supplements GLTL's otherwise timely comments.  E.NAPSA  NAPSA reaffirms that no adverse conditions exist in the United States/Iquitos,Peru subtrade. It, therefore, requests that the Commission maintain itscurrent policy permitting NAPSA free access to this subtrade. Further,NAPSA states that the rescission of Decree 009-86 should moot the controversyconcerning the Trade generally.  F. Nedlloyd  Nedlloyd explains that it has an interest in this proceeding because itplans to institute a service between Chile and the United States on orabout July 1, 1988. Nedlloyd states that it will attempt to offer servicesbetween Peru and the United States depending on the outcome of this proceedingand the actions taken by the GOP. It contends that the long term commercialviability of this proposed service depends on Nedlloyd's ability to servePeru as part of its West Coast South America/United States service.Nedlloyd expresses concern over the effects of the recent rescission ofDecree 009-86 and the reestablishment of the cargo waiver system underDecree 036-82. It takes the position that the cargo waiver system underDecree 036-82 is a barrier to third-flag carrier entry into the Trade.Nedlloyd points out that if it wishes to operate in the Trade, it eithermust obtain a waive or seek associate status by entering into agreementswith Peruvian-flag carriers. Nedlloyd finds neither of these options commerciallyattractive because they impose economic costs on the Trade in general andon Nedlloyd in particular. With regard to obtaining waivers, Nedlloyd assertsthat Peruvian-flag carriers and their associates can schedule sailingsso that it is virtually impossible for a third-flag carrier to qualifyfor a waiver.Further, Nedlloyd maintains that there are potential costs, official andunofficial, of obtaining waivers. It states that it has experienced severecommercial difficulties dealing with the Peruvian cargo preference regimein the Peru/Far East trades and is not eager to be exposed to future harmin its efforts to provide service in the Trade.Nedlloyd also notes that, based on its experience, the option of obtainingassociate status entails costs which distort the economics of a trade andextracts a ``price of admission'' from the third-flag carrier. Nedlloydmaintains that third-flag carriers should not be required to enter suchagreements when there is no economic or commercial basis for doing so.It contends that these agreements have the effect of diminishing efficiencyand price competitiveness of transportation providers.Nedlloyd alleges that conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Trade continueto exist. It contends that Decree 036-82 inherently discriminates againstnon-Peruvian-flag carriers and favors Peruvian-flag and associate carriers.Nedlloyd submits that there is no reason to believe that this waiver regimewill not have an injurious effect on carriers, shippers and the Trade,similar to the ``authorization'' system under Decree 009-86. Nedlloyd maintainsthat because it does not wish to become an associate carrier, Decree 036-82will preclude it from operating in the Trade. It asserts that there shouldbe no doubt that Decree 036-82 is inconsistent with free access to theTrade.Nedlloyd recommends, therefore, that the Commission act swiftly to reinstatethe Final Rule, with appropriate modifications, on the basis that conditionsunfavorable to shipping continue to exist.G. CPV, Neptuno and SantaThe Peruvian carriers allege that conditions have significantly changedin the Trade given the rescission of Decree 009-86. They contend that thedecrees in existence prior to Decree 009-86 \1\\6\<NOTE/> and now reestablished, have restored the Trade to its priorstate which the Commission has allegedly never found objectionable. Underthese decrees, the Peruvian carriers state that only 50 percent of Peruvianimport and export cargo is reserved to Peruvian-flag and associate carriers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Decree 012-70-TC of June 1970, 034-70-TC of December1970, and 036-82-TC of September 1982.Further, noting that those parties supporting the Final Rule had arguedthat Decree 009-86 denied U.S. shippers the right to choose third-flagcarriers, the Peruvian carriers assert that as a result of the three commercialagreements between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriers, shippers will beable to choose Chilean-flag carriers. They also advise that the GOP hascreated a commission to further improve conditions in the Trade throughits review of Peruvian maritime policy.The Peruvian carriers contend, therefore, that given the changes in GOPlaw and the commercial agreements between Chilean and Peruvian-flag carriers,whatever basis may have existed for the Final Rule is no longer present.Further, they submit that the Final Rule casts uncertainty over the Trade,threatens diplomatic relations and courts retaliation. The Peruvian carrierssubmit that, substantially, all concerns expressed by interested partieshave been resolved. They believe that whatever residual concerns or uncertaintyexist do not justify continuation of the proceeding and it, therefore,should be terminated.H. The Chamber The Chamber notes the good faith efforts made by the GOP and USG to addressthe situation in the Trade through diplomatic means. It mentions that therepeal of Decree 009-86 and the joint service or space charter agreementsbetween Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriers should result in improvementsin the Trade and provide U.S. shippers with greater freedom of choice inU.S. trades. Further, the Chamber contends that the recent increase inU.S. exports to Peru could not have been achieved if conditions unfavorableto U.S. shippers existed. The Chamber, therefore, supports reconsideration of the Final Rule. Itbelieves that the Commission should now find that there is adequate servicein the Trade. Further, it believes that the Commission should find thatthe GOP's rules and regulations permit U.S. shippers freedom to selectthe carriers of their choice and create conditions which are no more restrictivethan those allegedly accepted by the FMC in most other U.S. trades. The Chamber takes the position that because the conditions which causedthe complaints to the FMC have been corrected, given the improvement inthird-flag carrier access to the Trade and the good faith efforts by theGOP to accommodate shippers, the Commission should take no further action,but rather carefully monitor conditions in the Trade. Suspension of Peruvian-flagcarriers' tariffs by the FMC allegedly would lead to retaliation by theGOP and suspension of the maritime trade. The Chamber submits that thiswould be extremely damaging to the relations between the two countriesand contrary to U.S. economic and political objectives. I. GSC GSC submitted a copy of a letter sent to the Honorable Robin Tallon, whichrequests that the Congressman review the FMC's actions against Peruvian-flagcarriers. This letter expresses hopes that the Congressman would supportit in stopping any retaliation against Peruvian-flag carriers because suchaction could affect GSC's ability to operate in the future. GSC explainsthat it receives a substantial amount of raw materials from Peru becausethe U.S. does not have the quality of ore required for its process. GSC advises that the GOP's cargo reservation system has never been a problemfor it. GOP allegedly has granted it waivers whenever necessary. In thisregard, GSC advises that it recently used an Ecuadorian-flag carrier forshipment of cargo. GSC contends that to restrict the Peruvian-flag vesselswhich it may employ in the Trade would inflate the cost of its operation.J. Occidental Occidental states that it was pleased with the FMC's decision to excludethe U.S./Iquitos, Peru trade from the proposed sanctions in the Final Rule.It maintains that this decision has enabled it to support its operationsin that area. Further, Occidental states because it also has operationson the West Coast of Peru, it joins the Chamber in requesting that theCommission reconsider its proposed sanctions against Peru. Finally, Occidentalbelieves that the GOP's repeal of Decree 009-86 and improved access tothe Trade for third-flag carriers should allow the FMC to rescind its FinalRule. K. SPCC  SPCC advises that if the proposed rule \1\\7\<NOTE/> was enacted, it would be forced to seek supplies from Europeand the Far East rather than the United States, and that copper bound forthe U.S. would have to move through ports in Mexico or Canada prior todelivery in the U.S. SPCC contends that this would cause increased costsand delays. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ It is assumed that SPCC means the Final Rule. SPCC opposes the suspension of Peruvian-flag carriers' tariffs. It assertsthat the commercial agreements between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriersaddress the concerns of the FMC because Chilean-flag carriers will be accordedassociate status. SPCC takes the position, therefore, that the problemswhich brought about Commission action in the Trade no longer exist andthat action by the Commission would be counterproductive. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Uncertainty continues to exist as to the precise nature and operating characteristicsof the shipping regime which will regulate traffic between the U.S. andPeru following the rescission of Decree No. 009-86 and the reestablishmentof Decree 036-82 and other pre-1986 decrees and resolutions. We continueto be concerned about the terms upon which Chilean-flag carriers and otherthird-flag carriers will be gaining competitive access to the Trade pursuantto ``commercial agreements'' filed with the Commission. The impact of theseagreements will not be known for some time. The comments on the Commission'sMarch Notice reflect a wide range of views regarding third-flag accessto the Trade given the reestablishment of the pre-1986 legal regime inPeru, and the commercial agreements filed. At the least, some of the commentscall into question whether the agreements are commercially viable or wereentered into solely as an accommodation to the GOP's cargo reservationand other decrees. Nedlloyd is the only commenter that believes that the Commission shouldswiftly reinstate the Final Rule with necessary modifications, on the basisthat conditions unfavorable to shipping continue to exist because third-flagcarrier access to the Trade requires associate status or a waiver. WhileSCOT believes that unfavorable conditions continue to exist, and that theagreement between CSAV and Neptuno does not provide effective competitiveaccess for CSAV, it states that its members will require at least 90 daysto evaluate the effects of recent Peruvian actions on the Trade.We note that the Chilean party to one of these agreements, CSAV, does notaffirmatively propose or support any specific course of action, but statesthat it would not oppose suspension of the Final Rule. However, it suggeststhat accompanying such action should be a statement from the Commissionthat the Final Rule could be reimposed if necessary. Thus, it would appear,that CSAV is not particularly sanguine about the agreement it has enteredinto and which ostensibly will allow it access to the Trade.While the Executive Agencies appear optimistic with respect to the problemof Chilean-flag carrier access to the Trade, they are not as certain asto the access of other third-flag carriers. They maintain, however, thatgiven the developments in the Trade, sanctions are not warranted at thistime.GLTL suggests that the Commission hold any further action in abeyance untilit has completed agreement negotiations with CPV. The prospective agreementbetween the two carriers would confer associate status on GLTL.The Chamber, GSC, NAPSA, Occidental and SPCC believe that the problemswhich gave rise to the Final Rule have been resolved and, thus, opposeany further action by the Commission. The Peruvian carriers specificallyrequest termination of the proceeding.The pre-1986 legal regime now in place appears to reserve 50 percent, ratherthan 100 percent, of Peruvian traffic for Peruvian-flag and <T3>associate </T3>carriers. The remaining 50 percent is open to all carriers,including nonassociate carriers. However, under Decree 036-82, a non-associatecarrier must obtain a waiver or cargo manifest certification to carry anyportion of the unreserved cargo. The manner in which the ``50 percent''reservation is to be administered is unclear in light of the requirementsfor waivers or manifest certifications on <T3>all </T3>non-Peruvian or non-associate shipments. Given the variousrequirements, it is possible that significant barriers to non-Peruvian-flagand non-associate carrier access to the Trade continue to exist.The GOP has stated that it is reviewing its maritime policy in generaland its waiver system in particular. It is reported that the GOP plansto apply its waiver system in as flexible a manner as possible.Reinstatement of the Final Rule appears disfavored by all but one of theparties to this proceeding. The only party requesting immediate reinstatementof the Final Rule with appropriate modifications is a third-flag carrierwhich has not yet attempted to enter the Trade. With this one exception,the parties believe that the Commission should either terminate the proceedingor hold any further action in abeyance until the situation can be assessed.Reinstatement of the Final Rule would not, moreover, allow shippers theopportunity requested to evaluate the impact of the recent GOP actionsand the Chilean and Peruvian-flag carrier agreements on the Trade. Theparties which throughout this proceeding have urged Commission action tomeet unfavorable conditions in the Trade are now requesting more time toevaluate the situation, and in the case of CSAV, stating that it wouldnot formally object to a suspension of the proceeding.The course of action suggested by SCOT and others, to hold the proceedingin abeyance for a reasonable period, will allow the Commission time toassess the impact of the recent developments in the Trade including theeffect of the pre-1986 legal regime on third-flag carrier access to theTrade, the commercial agreements between Peruvian and Chilean-flag carriers,the anticipated agreement between CPV and GLTL and the GOP maritime policyreview. This course of action, in one form or another, appears to be favored,or acceptable, to all but one of the commenters.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>Although the Commission is anxious to achieve a resolution of the problemsaffecting the Trade, it does not appear that further Commission action<T3>at this time </T3>would favorably affect events or actions by the GOPwhich are moving forward, albeit slowly. The comments from shippers andthe carriers presently active in the trade reflect a consensus that, asconditions presently exist, Commission action would be premature.The Commission has already expressed herein its continued concern thatimpediments to the entry and operation of third-flag carriers on commerciallyviable terms may continue to exist, at the least as a part of the re-instatedwaiver and manifest certification system under Decree 036-82. Nevertheless,the practical workings and effects of that Decree are at present unclearto us, particularly in light of the new agreements among major partiesin the Trade.In order to assess the impact of these new factors, the Commission willhold this proceeding in abeyance for a further period of time. We anticipatethat the GOP will have taken further action to clarify the status of lawsand decrees affecting shipping in the Trade, including completion of thework of the Commision reviewing maritime policy, before the FMC resumesconsideration of these matters.Therefore, pursuant to section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920,46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b), Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961, 75 Stat. 870,and 46 CFR Part 585, this proceeding is held in abeyance pending furtherorder of the Commission. Interested parties are invited to submit comments,views and information on or before August 31, 1988, concerning whetherthe conditions unfavorable to shipping in the U.S.-Peru Trade previouslyfound in this proceeding continue to exist, whether other conditions unfavorableto shipping now exist as a result of actions, laws, decrees or regulationsof the Government of Peru or carriers in the Trade, and what actions theCommission should take to adjust or meet any such conditions unfavorableto shipping.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Tony P.
