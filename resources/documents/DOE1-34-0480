This new CT technology uses an electron beam and stationary circulartargets to create a rotating X-ray source to achieve ultra-fast scans.The authors are privileged to be one of the first sites to employ thisnew technology for clinical radiological imaging and research. The purposeof this paper is to present the current status of this new CT technologyin a clinical setting and our evaluation of its imaging performance froma user's standpoint.</TEXT></DOC>
