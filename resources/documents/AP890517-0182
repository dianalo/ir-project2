But Yegor Yakovlev, editor of the weekly Moscow News, warned inhis column against ``unjust methods'' to obtain ``just results.''   ``Passions are inflamed. Could it be that our own home-grownWatergate is starting to burn?'' Yakovlev asked, referring to thescandal surrounding two criminal investigators who have mentionedformer members of the ruling Politburo in an inquiry intocorruption.   One investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, said on Friday that the nameof Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev also came up in the inquiry.He did not go into details.   Ligachev has denied the allegations and called the statementslanderous and ``a political provocation,'' the Novosti pressagency said Tuesday. Ivanov is being investigated in the SupremeSoviet Presidium for alleged abuses of power.   Yakovlev's column focused on crime-fighter Telman Gdlyan,Ivanov's boss. Gdlyan and Ivanov gained national fame in theirclean-up of a corruption case that began with an Uzbek collectivefarm chairman and spread to include top regional officials and theson-in-law of late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.   A Supreme Court probe found that in a separate case in 1983,Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man, an eminent Estonianscientist who died in prison. The court has asked the prosecutor'soffice to consider dismissing Gdlyan.   But the people are behind Gdlyan, Yakovlev said.   ``As I write these lines, under the windows of the editorialoffices the crowd is whistling, and from hand to hand passes apetition not to remove the investigator from the work he hasalready begun,'' he wrote.   And when Yakovlev said at a public meeting that he could notforgive Gdlyan for his handling of Johannes Hint, the Estonianscientist, he was drowned out by the whistles, stamping andshouting of the irritated crowd.   Yakovlev protested that the Soviet public must learn that ``wemustn't obtain just results with unjust methods.''   ``We've all come out of decades of lawlessness. They cost us sodearly that people are prepared to fight lawlessness on theprinciple that any means are all right,'' he wrote.   Yakovlev emphasized that Gdlyan was not the only one to blamefor Hint's death: He came onto the case late, and the courtconvicted Hint.</TEXT></DOC>
