In addition, this groupseeks to meet the needs of other Laboratory facilities which also havemandated training requirements. During the first phase, we establishedour charter and our goals, we collaboratively developed a recordkeepingsystem, and we actively exchanged training information between facilities.We sought information from DOE auditors and DOE contractor technicaltraining managers. We also brought a DOE-sponsored Train the TechnicalTrainer program on-site. This initial period has been active. With thepossibility of an increasing number of DOE and Laboratory Health regulations,the need for this group and the resources it provides will become evenmore important to the Laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
