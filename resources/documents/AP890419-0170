Witnesses said three people were killed.   Officials said at least 18 people have been injured in two daysof rioting in the city of Maan, 120 miles south of Amman. Therioting, prompted by price increases and an economic austerityagreement with the International Monetary Fund, spread to at leastthree other towns.   The violence appeared to be the worst in Jordan since the armycrushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1970-71 and drove them from thecountry.   A police source said a 21-year-old army soldier on leave wasfatally wounded in Maan. The source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, identified the man as Ahmed Matlab Saudi.   Saudi was on the roof of his house, watching protesters stoninggovernment buildings and destroying police cars, when he was hit bya stray bullet, the source said.   The source could not confirm the two other deaths.   But residents in Maan, also speaking privately, said the twowere among the protesters who took to the streets despite thecurfew to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai.They would not give details.   King Hussein and Rifai were in Washington to discussArab-Israeli peace efforts with President Bush. Asked about thedisturbances, the monarch told reporters, ``Everything is undercontrol.''   Earlier Wednesday, the government deployed a massive force ofpolice and soldiers, some in armored cars and wearing riot gear,along major highways.   But the unrest spread to Tafilah, 80 miles south of Amman, andHusnyeih, 95 miles from the capital. These two cities and Maanremained under curfew, but residents reached by telephone saidgunfire could be heard all afternoon.   Witnesses said hundreds of rioters on Wednesday attacked atleast seven banks in Kerak, 50 miles south of Amman. The streets ofthe city were filled with army officers, lined with charredbuildings and littered with metallic debris.   Windows of several government offices were smashed, and at leastthree burned cars lay at the entrance of the city.   Crown Prince Hassan, acting as head of state in the king'sabsence, told reporters that 12 policemen and six civilians wereinjured in Maan. He said arrests were made but did not say how many.   Jordan has experienced little turmoil for 15 years, in largemeasure because of a rapid increase in living standards andeducation financed by aid from Arab oil states. That aid hasdeclined recently, and the country has a $6 billion debt.   Officials said trouble began when taxi drivers roused studentsto riot on Tuesday because the drivers were angered by a 25 percentincrease in the price of gasoline, to the equivalent of $1.65 agallon, and a doubling of the annual license fee to $370.   Tires smoldered in Maan's streets and young men changed demandsfor the resignation of Rifai, whose government announced priceincreases Sunday for gasoline, auto licenses and other items.   Some chanted: ``This man must resign or we will burn thecountry!''   ``This govenment is all thieves!'' declared a youth who gave hisname as Mahmoud, face shrouded by an Arab scarf and hands blackwith the soot of burning tires.   Price increases are part of a deal with the IMF to reduce budgetdeficits and reschedule the foreign debt. They follow a year ofrising unemployment and rapid inflation in which the dinar lostnearly 40 percent of its buying power, often doubling the prices ofsuch imported goods as cars and appliances.   Wages have not risen to compensate and the government also hascut overtime and other benefits for public employees. MostJordanians earn between $185 and $370 a month.</TEXT></DOC>
