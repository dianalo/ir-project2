But maybe they ought to worry even before then.    That's because crime is skyrocketing at many airports. At Miami Airport, reported crimes jumped 30% in 1987 over 1986, with 5,410 incidents. Kennedy Airport had a 22% crime increase last year. And at Los Angeles International Airport, crime rose 23% in 1987.    Most of the crime isn't violent, although two rapes and 20 robberies were reported at Chicago's O'Hare Airport last year. Typical crimes: Luggage thefts, pickpocketing and car break-ins.    Police say the figures are up because the number of travelers is rising, while the size of most airport police departments isn't. Miami's airport handled 9% more passengers in 1987, but still has only 30 officers on duty per shift. More sophisticated groups of pickpockets and scam artists are also targeting airports, police say.    &quot;One of them distracts you by asking for directions,&quot; says Capt. Edward Scullion of the Chicago Police Department. &quot;You put your bag down and suddenly, it's gone.&quot;    Such thieves find airports particularly attractive because they have so many foreigners, who police say aren't always as suspicious as Americans. And many thieves don't fear an arrest; most victims are out-of-towners who won't return to testify.    To combat this, the Los Angeles City Attorney recently persuaded 34 airlines and six hotels to pay the cost of bringing airport-crime victims to court. Some airport police forces have also reassigned more officers from traffic duty to patrol work.    No-Refund Case: Score   One for the Little Guy   IF YOU THINK non-refundable airline tickets aren't fair, you're not alone. A judge in Onondaga County in upstate New York thinks so, too.    In what may be a legal first, county Judge Patrick Cunningham ruled Northwest Airlines must refund $960 to a family for unused non-refundable tickets. His reasoning: If Northwest can disrupt people's plans by overbooking flights and bumping them, then fliers should be able to change plans too.    Northwest &quot;has an inequitable situation where (it has) the best of both worlds,&quot; the judge ruled. The airline, saying it needs the policy in order to offer certain discounts, plans an appeal.    The suit was brought by Daniel F. Mathews Jr., a Syracuse, N.Y., attorney, and his wife, who bought six non-refundable tickets to Florida last year. The couple then realized they picked the wrong week for their children's vacation and asked Northwest to change the dates of their tickets. The airline refused.    Northwest also refused a refund when Mrs. Mathews produced a doctor's note saying an eye problem prevented her from flying. Airlines normally accept medical excuses, &quot;but it's a discretionary decision,&quot; says a Northwest spokesman.    Judge Cunningham called that refusal an &quot;unconscionable abuse&quot; of the family's rights. But legal experts say it's too early to tell if the ruling will hold up on appeal.    Do Airlines Put Money   Where Your Mouth Is?    AIRLINES SAY they care about the quality of airline food. But how much quality can $4.21 buy?    That's how much the industry averages on food spent per passenger. And some carriers spend a lot less; USAir averaged $1.93 per passenger in food expenses in the third quarter of 1987, the latest figures available.    USAir says the figure is low only because most of its flights are relatively short, which prevents it from serving certain meals. It also says it saves money in ways that don't affect its meals, such as using its own ice machines instead of buying ice.    But consumer specialists say food expenditures are definitely one measure of airline food. &quot;If there's a $1 or $2 difference in the average between two airlines, that has to mean something,&quot; says Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.    ---   Meal Money   Dollars spent on food, per passenger, in 1987 third quarter.

Odds and Ends   THE NEWS KEEPS getting worse for coupon brokers, the companies that buy and sell frequent-flier awards. A federal judge in Los Angeles has granted an injunction prohibiting a coupon broker from selling Trans World Airlines' awards. However, the judge stayed the decision pending any appeals. . . . To help combat AIDS, hotels in some foreign countries began putting condoms in rooms last year. But when an advertising promotional company recently asked 500 U.S. hotels if they were interested in adding condoms as another amenity in their bathrooms, only a few expressed any interest -- and none eventually added them. &quot;A lot of chains think they might offend guests with them,&quot; says Steven Rogers, president of Sierra Pacific Specialty Advertising Inc. in Upland, Calif. But AIDS support groups point out that many hotels show adult movies on television. &quot;Doesn't that offend some people?&quot; says a spokeswoman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. </TEXT></DOC>
