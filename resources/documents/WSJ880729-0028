Tokyo share prices rallied in the afternoon only to fall back in the last hour of trading to close with modest gains.    The Nikkei index edged up 57.52 points to close at 27796.09. The index earlier rose to a high of around 27940, or up about 200 points.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 7.28 to 2195.84. Volume on the first section was estimated at a moderate 850 million shares, down from 900 million shares Wednesday.    In early Tokyo trading Friday, the Nikkei index rose 206.33 points, to 28002.42.    Julian Jones, a salesman with Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers, said that much of Thursday's activity was centered on high-priced shares as investors moved away from the cheaper large-capitalization issues. &quot;It is a very frenetic market,&quot; he said, &quot;with herd movements into whatever is labeled as being in vogue.&quot;    Ron Napier, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., said that the U.S. second-quarter gross national product figures released overnight helped to prop up the market during the day. The weaknesses shown by the statistics, he said, pointed to the likelihood that the dollar won't continue rising in the short term. This reduced the pressure on Japanese interest rates and in turn helped the stock market.    One trader said the share prices weakened in the final hour on profit-taking that began with the blue chips and spread through to the large-capital steel and heavy industrial issues.    &quot;Sony had been higher for four days running,&quot; said one trader, &quot;so it was a magnet for profit-takers, and it helped prompt the market to weaken.&quot;    Sony fell from a high of 7,250 yen to close at 7,090 yen ($54), up 220 yen. Hitachi fell from a high on the session of 1,990 to close 40 higher at 1,960, while Toshiba eased from a modest gain to close down 40 at 1,150.    Among blue-chip auto makers, Honda was up 40 at 2,440, but more than 100 yen off from its best level Wednesday.    London share prices managed to creep into positive territory in the last half-hour in choppy trading as only selected stocks found favor in a market largely devoid of direction.    Dealers said the market appears indecisive about whether to move below 1840, the 100-share index's technically important support line.    Some traders contended that the lack of significant movement below 1840 highlights the market's underlying buoyancy and said shares could power ahead once a new two-week trading account is opened Friday.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 1.9 points at 1480.7. Volume was recorded at 494.3 million shares, above Wednesday's 363.9 million shares. The 100-share index closed 0.5 point higher at 1841.3.    The market's attention was clearly trained on speculative situations, giving selected stocks a sharp boost. And the lack of a strong move on the part of fund managers to enter the market, except in these special situations, also gave no incentive for players to pile into new equity positions.    Rumors that Lloyds Bank would announce a rights issue Friday pressured the overall market lower late in the afternoon, dealers said. Lloyds is slated to release its half-year results Friday morning. Its shares slipped 10 pence to 298 ($5.15). A spokesman at Lloyds refused to comment on the talk.    Imperial Chemical Industries, thought to be a bellwether of British industry, reported that its pretax profit rose 13.3% in the first half of 1988, exceeding forecasts. But ICI finished 2 lower at #10.28 as the pound rose sharply against the mark, dealers said.    Pearson moved ahead 32 to close at 774, after trading as high as 796, as various rumors made the rounds. One held that Pearson might sell off its oil exploration and production operations in the North Sea, which one analyst valued at about #130 million.    Share prices ended lower on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, pressured by the rise in the key West German lending rate and by a drop in stock prices on Wall Street Wednesday.    Brokers said market participants sold lightly throughout the day as most of them already had expected the Bundesbank's decision-making central bank council to change some interest rates at its Thursday meeting. For that reason, when the report of a half-point rise in the Lombard lending rate to 5% reached the market, the impact on share prices was negligible.    A broker at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said trading volume was &quot;minuscule&quot; because interest rate developments in Germany and the fall in the U.S. stocks Wednesday &quot;sidelined most large market players.&quot;    Car makers finished lower. Shares of Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 4 marks to 501 ($271), Daimler-Benz fell 6.5 to 680.5, and Volkswagen was down 4.7 to 248.5.    Electronics group Siemens was off 1.5 at 417.5, while electrical group AEG was unchanged at 202.2.    Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Amsterdam and Zurich, mixed in Milan and Brussels and higher in Stockholm.    In Zurich, peristent takeover rumors catapulted the insurance sector into the limelight. Wednesday's announcement that Rentenanstalt had outbid two other suitors for La Suisse unleashed a fury of speculative buying of small-to-medium Swiss insurance titles. While the overall insurance sector advanced 2% to 3%, the three largest Swiss insurers closed mixed.    Among Pacific markets, share prices closed at a record high in Taipei, were mixed in Hong Kong, Singapore and Manila and lower in Sydney, Wellington and Seoul.    Hong Kong shares finished mixed in light trading after the market gave up almost all of its earlier gains in the afternoon. Brokers attributed the lackluster performance to the confusion arising from mixed directions on overseas stock markets, and a lack of market-moving news.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
