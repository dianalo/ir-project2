Under the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement nowbeing negotiated, U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles andsubmarines would be cut by 30 percent to 50 percent.   Warnke said that agreement could be completed and signed at thesummit President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevplan to hold in Washington next June, a meeting the two leadersagreed to at the Malta Summit last week.   ``There is no reason at all we can't go ahead with a START 2treaty,'' Warnke said.   Such a second treaty should aim at banning missiles withmultiple warheads, Warnke said.   Warnke argued that Soviet troop withdrawals from Eastern Europeand the political changes sweeping the Warsaw Pact countries meanfewer nuclear weapons are needed to defend the West.   He said the major obstacle in the strategic arms reduction talksin Geneva was the U.S. program to devise a space shield againstballistic missile attack.   ``But that idea left town with Mr. Reagan,'' Warnke said of theU.S. Strategic Defense Initiative championed by the formerpresident but viewed with skepticism by many in Congress and mostarms control experts.   A ban on missiles with multiple warheads would eliminate thethreat of a nuclear first strike by either side, Warnke suggested.   Such an attack would require so many single-warhead missiles theaggressor would be unable to defend against nuclear retaliation _and therefore would not launch an attack, he argued.   But Warnke, who was former President Carter's chief negotiator,stressed the two sides should complete the current START treatyfirst before making deeper cuts in their strategic weapons.   Congress has approved a Bush administration plan to extend theU.S. arsenal of land-based missiles armed with multiple warheadsthat could reach all targets within the Soviet Union by puttingsome on rail cars that could move around in a crisis, making themharder for the Soviets to destroy.   Warnke said that ``probably was a lousy idea'' and wouldescalate nuclear tensions.</TEXT></DOC>
