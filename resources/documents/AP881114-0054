An 11-member inquest jury in Craigavon, 19 miles southwest ofBelfast, was to establish the circumstances surrounding the shootingdeaths of Gervase McKerr, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns. The IrishRepublican Army has acknowledged the three as members.   A detective told the inquest that police had been told before theshootings that the IRA was planning to kill a member of the securityforces, and that Toman and Burns, both 21, were thought to be armed.   One hour after the hearing began, a lawyer for the family ofMcKerr, 31, walked out in protest when the coroner heading theinquest refused to summon three officers to testify.   Attorney Pat Finnucane said he would ask the Northern IrelandHigh Court to order the officers to answer questions at the inquest.   The three IRA men were shot dead in a police ambush on Nov. 11,1982 as they drove through County Armagh, a hotbed of guerrillaactivity geared primarily toward assassinating police officers.   Three more unarmed Roman Catholics, two of them guerrillas andone a teen-ager, died in two other police ambushes in County Armaghover the next month.   At first, police said all the deaths occurred in the normalcourse of anti-terrorist warfare. But subsequent evidence suggestedthe killings were deliberate and avoidable, and that police wereoperating an alleged ``shoot-to-kill policy'' in the Britishprovince.   The overwhelmingly Catholic IRA is fighting to ridProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule and unite itwith the Irish Republic.   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's top official inthe province, has barred the inquest from investigating certaincircumstances of the shootings which he considers would be``detrimental to the national security.''   King's order, signed last week, expressed concern aboutjeopardizing present and future counter-terrorist operations.   A screen, heavily guarded by policemen, concealed the identitiesof police officers giving testimony.   Allegations that police systematically distorted thecircumstances of the killings culminated in a 1986 police inquirywhich uncovered evidence that at least 11 police officers wereinvolved in a conspiracy to pervert justice.   The investigating officer, John Stalker, deputy chief constableof the Manchester police force, was abruptly dismissed from thetwo-year inquiry in May 1986 and suspended for ``disciplinaryoffenses.''   The allegations of misconduct turned out to be trivial and apolice watchdog panel cleared Stalker. But he was not restored tothe Northern Ireland inquiry into the Royal Ulster Constabulary, theprovince's overwhelmingly Protestant police force.   Critics say it reaffirms the belief that British rule in NorthernIreland is unjust toward the Catholic minority.   Inquests into the three other killings are expected to be held atthe end of the first inquest.</TEXT></DOC>
