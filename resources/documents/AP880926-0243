In a communique released at the conclusion of the meeting, theoil ministers also said it was essential that a joint meeting ofthe price committee and the Long-Term Strategy Committee be held toreview existing OPEC strategies and objectives.   ``No lasting stability in the world oil market can be achievedwithout concrete cooperation by the non-OPEC oil producingcountries and their contribution in regulating world supplies ofoil in line with demand,'' the price committee said.   OPEC Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia, speaking toreporters at a news conference following the meeting, underscoredthe committee's statement saying the cause of the recent fall inoil prices was ``mainly due to a significant overproduction of someOPEC countries as well as non-OPEC oil producers.''   Subroto said the ministers would decide after the joint meetingwhether a special session of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries should be called before its regularly scheduledmeeting Nov. 21 in Vienna.   Oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange, whichhad risen earlier in the day, began falling immediately afterSubroto's statements then recovered slightly, analysts said. Onebroker said Subroto's comments were interpreted as indicating OPECwas unwilling to take immediate action to restrain oil output andboost sagging oil prices.   The meeting of the price committee was called in response to therecent slump in world oil prices, which earlier this month hittheir lowest level since the summer of 1986 when they fell below$10 a barrel.   According to many analysts, sagging prices represent the failureof nearly all OPEC members to respect production quotas.   The secretary general did not give specific dates for the jointmeeting except to say it would probably be held in October.   Subroto said Iran and Iraq are to speak directly with each otherat the Long-Term Strategy Committee for the first time in yearswithin OPEC. He downplayed the significance of such a meeting,however, saying it was normal that their respective oil ministersshould speak since their foreign ministers began meeting last monthin peace talks.   The Long-Term Strategy Committee is comprised of OPEC's foundingmembers, including: Iran, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Algeria, Venezuelaand Kuwait. Subroto said Iran and Iraq have both confirmed theirattendance at the joint session. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela andAlgeria also are members of the price committee, along with Nigeriaand Indonesia.   Since the last price committee meeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne,Switzerland, a cease-fire between the two countries in theireight-year Gulf War has begun to hold.   The Price Evolution Committee, as the price committee isofficially named, is an influential panel that studies pricedevelopments and compliance with OPEC policies, namely productionquotas, by OPEC members, although it has no enforcement powers.   The committee may, however, call for special meetings of all 13OPEC members.   The committee said it also examined during the emergency sessionin the Spanish capital a report prepared by the Vienna-based OPECSecretariat on current market conditions as well as a reportpresented by Subroto on the outcome of his recent visits to variousOPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries.   The Paris-based International Energy Energy Agency reported OPECproduction at 19 million barrels a day in August and OPEC PresidentRilwanu Lukman has put OPEC production at closer to 20 millionbarrels per day.   Last June, OPEC set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling toapply to all OPEC nations except Iraq, which has refused to goalong with OPEC quotas, saying it needs to produce more oil torebuild its war-torn economy following eight years of fighting withIran.   On Monday, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October wasquoted at $13.25, up slightly from Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
