At last, someone isattacking the nonstandard SQL problem.andP;  SQL Access Group is dedicated topromoting interoperability among SQL-based relational database managementsystems (RDBMSs).andP;  Under development is a set of detailed specifications fora standard programming interface and a network communication protocol toallow applications and DBMS servers from different vendors to communicate.andO;The SQL Access Group is addressing communication among SQL-based applicationsand DBMSs, basing its specifications on the SQL standard and on the evolvingISO Remote Data Access (RDA) standard.andP;  The group plans to publish atechnical guide to interoperability in early this year; a workingdemonstration of its implementation will follow in the second half of 1990.andM;THE GOAL.andP;  The group's ultimate goal is transparent access between a clientapplication and a database server.andP;  Ideally, any application on any systemwould be able to access any data over any network.andP;  Needless to say,achieving this is a complex problem with several dimensions.andP;  The problemapplies not only to accessing relational databases (the focus of the newgroup), but to accessing the vast amounts of data stored in non-relationaldatabases and file systems as well.andP;  This is far more than just a networkingproblem.andM;Client/Server Protocols.andP;  Client applications and database servers usedifferent client/server protocols far talking to each other.andP;  An Oracleapplication, for example, cannot connect to a Digital Rdb server since itsends SQL statements in a different sequence than Rdb expects to receive.andO;The messages sent by the client are not intelligible to the server and viceversa.andP;  The client/server protocol must be consistently implemented toachieve interoperability.andP;  It must also be network-independent--implementedthe same way regardless of whether the transport is SNA, DECnet, TCP/IP,etc.--and must accommodate multiple networks.andM;The ISO/RDA committee is addressing this client/server protocol issue.andP;  Thecommunications portion of the SQL Access Group's solution will be RDA-based.andO;One of the group's objectives is to speed up the work being done by theISO/RDA committee.andM;SQL Implementations.andP;  With the existence of an industry SQL standard, onewould expect to see SQL implemented consistently across RDBMSs.andO;Unfortunately, this is not the case.andP;  As written, the SQL standard is notdetailed enough to ensure a standard implementation.andP;  Not only are theresemantic differences between vendor implementations of the same SQLstatement, but each vendor has also chosen its own set of extension to itsset of &quot;standard&quot; SQL statements.andM;A related issue is the inconsistency of datatypes among RDBSs.andP;  Differentdatabases support different datatypes, and can even define the same datatypein different ways (e.g., floating point).andP;  Other problems includeinternational character sets, and the need to translate between ASCII andEBCDIC.andM;Error Codes.andP;  Another aspect of incompatibility is each vendor's set ofproprietary error codes.andP;  A foreign client application cannot understand theerror messages received from the server.andM;Data Dictionary.andP;  RDBMSs are widely divergent in how the data dictionary isstructured and accessed.andP;  This is a critical issue since the data dictionarydescribes the database and must be accessible to both the developer and theapplication/user.andM;THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS.andP;  There are three approaches to DBMS interoperabilitytoday: the SQL Access Group, Sybase's Open Client/Server, and Open Desktop.andO;None of these provides a complete solution, but at least there are multiplestarting points from which to move ahead.andM;SQL ACCESS GROUP.andP;  The SQL Access Group's is focusing on developing an SQLserver specification detailed enough to produce database interoperability andapplication portability when implemented by multiple DBMS vendors.andP;  The keyhere is implementation consistency.andP;  The same front-end tools andapplications will operate against any compliant DBMS server, allowing adeveloper to write vendor-independent database applications.andM;Technical Specification.andP;  The specification will be based on existingstandards, and will include both an SQL Application Programming Interface(API) and a formats and protocols (FAP) specification.andP;  When published, thespecification will be available to anyone for the cost of the documentation.andO;It will also be submitted to the standards bodies for adoption.andP;  The groupdid not indicate that it would provide certification services, although itwill develop a working, heterogeneous demonstration of the specification.andM;The SQL API developed by the SQL Access Group will be of the &quot;commondenominator&quot; variety (you can choose the appropriate modifier--&quot;greatest&quot; or&quot;least&quot;--depending on your perspective).andP;  It will also include escapemechanisms to allow use of a DBMS's proprietary language and extensions tothe standard SQL.andM;The FAP specification will cover communication between a single vendor clientand a single vendor server.andP;  There will be no distributed databasecapabilities initially.andP;  The RDA standard simply defines communicationbetween a single client and a single server.andP;  It does not includecommunications between servers, nor does it handle distributed databaseissues, such as a client accessing multiple database servers in a singletransaction or SQL statement.andM;Providing a consistent SQL interface across multivendor DBMSs is the firststep in building a strong platform for heterogeneous distributed database.andO;The group stated that the second release of the specification will include atwo-phase commit protocol, although this by itself is not sufficient fordistributed databases.andP;  An automatic recovery manager is also necessary, andeach vendor would have to build its own until the specification includes it.andM;Members.andP;  The SQL Access Group, formed in August 1989, is a non-profitorganization open to all vendors.andP;  Current members include Ashton-Tate,Digital, Fujitsu America Incorporated, H-P, Informix, Ingres, Metaphor, NCR,Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Tandem Computers, Teradata Corporation, and Wang.andO;Notably missing is IBM.andP;  The group expects third-party activity to define SQLaccess to DB2 if IBM does not join.andP;  Sybase originally participated butdropped out since it felt that its Open Client/Server approach was moreappropriate.andM;SYBASE OPEN SERVER.andP;  Sybase is licensing its client and server APIs toprovide hardware-, software- and network-independent client/servercommunications.andP;  Developers and user organizations will now be able tointegrate non-Sybase front ends and servers into the Sybase environment usingthe Sybase Open Client and Open Server APIs.andP;  The most significant aspect ofthe new Open Server is the fact that it can interface to any server, and isnot limited to SQL-based servers.andP;  Sybase maintains that it is the firstdatabase vendor to open up its server interface by licensing the source codeand allowing the interface to be used with any type of server.andM;Some Background.andP;  The Sybase Client/Server Interfaces are designed to provideaccess and integration, across a network, among heterogeneous servers(non-Sybase data, application services, and gateways, in addition to theSybase SQL Server), applications (the Sybase SQL Toolset, third-partyproducts, or custom applications), and tools (e.g., spreadsheet, officeautomation, CASE, Sybase SQL Toolset, etc.).andM;Open Client, a programmable library interface for client applications,formerly known as DB-Library, has always been available from Sybase.andP;  Sybaseis now allowing other vendors to relicense Open Client.andP;  The Open Clientinterface can also be called from within programming languages.andM;With Open Server, the developer uses a consistent set of routines to access awide range of servers and data environments while masking the complexity ofthe server, the network, and the data from the user.andP;  Open Server is nowavailable in object code on Sun and Digital VAX platforms, with source codeavailable for an additional fee.andP;  Object code will be released for other Unixplatforms and OS/2 later this year.andM;Both the Open Client and Open Server sets of APIs extend ISO's RDA protocoland ANSI SQL.andP;  For example, the Sybase Open Server provides the ability tocommunicate with both SQL database servers and other types of servers.andM;The Open Server API does not have to run on the same platform as its server,although the implementation is cleaner if it does.andP;  Sybase will beencouraging other vendors to license the source code and port it tonon-Sybase platforms.andP;  Also, Open Server does not require the presence of aSybase SQL Server.andP;  In fact, a customer or developer could license both OpenClient and Open Server, interface to a non-Sybase front and back end, andnever use the SQL Toolset or SQL Server.andP;  That is the Sybase definition of anopen architecture.andM;The Benefits.andP;  Sybase is essentially solving the communications problem, butnot the application incompatibilities.andP;  In the Sybase approach, any OpenClient can communicate with any Open Server.andP;  The networking andclient/server protocol issues are dealt with, but the solution is notlanguage- and error code-independent.andP;  The language encapsulated in theSybase remote stored procedure is proprietary to the server.andP;  The user mustalso, for example, provide some of the necessary translations betweenproprietary and Sybase generic error-code constructs.andM;One advantage provided by the Sybase Open Client/Server APIs is the abilityto communicate server-to-server as well.andP;  Neither Open Desktop nor the SQLAccess Group has stated plans to tackle this problem.andM;OPEN DESKTOP.andP;  Open Desktop is a bundled package for the 386 Unix platform.andO;It includes software from Digital and HP (OSF/Motif), Ingres Corporation(Ingres RDBMS), Locus (distributed file system), and SCO (the Unix Operatingsystem).andP;  As the DBMS provider for the Open Desktop suite, Ingres hasimplemented features in its Open Desktop product to facilitate access toheterogeneous DBMSs.andM;One feature is its global communications architecture (GCA), which is basedon the RDA committee's work as currently defined.andP;  When RDA reachesinternational standard status (expected in 1991) Ingres will move to the fullstandard.andP;  This architecture consists of an implementation of RDA for theclient/server protocol and a gateway server that runs on the platform withthe DBMS server.andP;  With Ingres 6.0, these servers can be IBM's DB2 or SQL/DS,or Digital's Rdb (in addition, of course, to Ingres itself).andM;Ingres has also developed what it called Open SQL, a set of SQL statementswhich are common across the set of DBMSs accessible to an Ingres application.andO;Open SQL is a subset of the full Ingres SQL.andP;  Like the SQL Access Group'sAPI, Open SQL is essentially the greatest common denominator among the DBMSs.andO;Ingres has also chosen to implement some features that are not supported byall DBMSs.andP;  For example, Open SQL supports repeat queries, and, although notit's not implemented across the board, Open SQL emulates repeat queries forDBMSs that don't support it.andM;The purpose of the Ingres approach is to achieve portability of applications.andO;As long as the application is written with Open SQL, it doesn't matterwhether the back-end DBMS is Ingres, DB2, SQL/DS, or Rdb.andP;  The gateway willmake the appropriate translations.andP;  (It is also possible to escape from OpenSQL and use proprietary statements in an application, but, by doing so, theuser sacrifices portability.)andM;The Open Desktop solution is limited because the application must be anIngres application, and that the Ingres-developed gateway server is necessaryto translate SQL statements, datatypes, error codes, and the data dictionary.andO;It also cannot access non-SQL-based DBMSs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
