<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-0542 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of a comprehensive analysis of the limits on mixings betweenordinary fermions and possible heavy fermions with exotic SU(2) x U(1)assignments (e.g., left-handed singlets and/or right-handed doublets)are presented. A general formalism for describing such mixings is given.It is shown that a variety of constraints, including the relation betweenthe W and Z masses and the Fermi constant, charged-current universality,limits on induced right-handed charged currents, and flavor-diagonalneutral currents suffice to limit all directions in parameter space thatare not excluded by the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents.Limits on s{sup 2}, the square of the mixing between ordinary and exoticfermions, are quite stringent for the {nu}/sub {mu}//sub L/, {mu}/subL/{sup -}, u/sub L/, and d/sub L/ (s{sup 2}{le}0.002--0.005) if onlyone particle is allowed to mix at a time, but are weaker by an orderof magnitude if fine-tuned cancellations between different mixings areallowed. Similar statements apply to quark mixings with heavy sequentialdoublets. Limits on s{sup 2} for the other light fermions ({nu}/sub e//subL/, e/sub L/{sup -},e/sub R/{sup -},{mu}/sub R/{sup -}, u/sub R/,d/subR/) are in the range 0.02--0.06, while those for the s, c, b, {nu}/subtau/, and tau{sup -} are considerably weaker. Slightly stronger limitsare found in specific models (e.g., E{sub 6}). Implications for the massesof the heavy exotic fermions are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
