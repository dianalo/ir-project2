Seeks To Reverse Ruling On Severance Issue </HL><AUTHOR> Eileen White Read (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BA </CO><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   Boeing Co. and five former executives have asked a federal appeals court in Alexandria, Va., to reconsider its ruling that Boeing's severance payments to the executives violated the law.    At issue is a total of $485,000 paid to the executives, who left Boeing to take Defense Department posts in 1981 and 1982. In a 1986 suit, the Justice Department alleged that the payments &quot;created a conflict of interest situation.&quot;    The government didn't claim that the former executives did anything to benefit the Seattle-based aerospace concern or its military contracts. However, the suit alleged that the payments undermined the &quot;undivided loyalty that each employee owed the U.S.&quot; when accepting government service. Boeing initially billed the government for the payments, but backed down after being challenged by government auditors.    A federal judge in Washington ruled last year that because severance payments were a standard practice for Boeing officials who left the company for public service and that because some of the former executives' superiors were aware of and approved the practice, the payments &quot;neither created the appearance of nor (constituted) an actual conflict of interest.&quot;    In reversing that decision earlier this month, the majority of a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said &quot;corruption or an actual conflict of interest is not required&quot; to violate the law prohibiting outside payments to government officials. The payments &quot;were made with the intent to compensate for government service and created the appearance of a conflict of interest,&quot; the appeals court said.    The appellate panel also held that the government could recover the severance payments from the employees. But, it added, the statute of limitations had expired with regard to recovering money from Boeing, with one exception. The court held that Boeing is liable for $50,000 paid to Harold Kitson, a former Navy deputy assistant secretary for command, control, communications and intelligence. Mr. Kitson couldn't be reached for comment.    One of the three appellate judges dissented, saying in a minority opinion that Boeing's severance payments &quot;were in accordance with a policy followed by Boeing for over 20 years as a matter of good corporate citizenship.&quot;    Boeing and the five executives, in their petition filed last Friday, asked the appeals court for a rehearing before the entire court.    The others named in the suit and their severance payments are Melvyn Paisley, former assistant Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems, $183,000; Thomas K. Jones, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic and nuclear forces, $132,000; Herbert A. Reynolds, former deputy director of space and intelligence policy in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy $80,000; and Lawrence H. Crandon, thought by industry executives to be an official of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Air Command and Control System, $40,000.    None of the four could be reached for comment. A Boeing spokesman said Mr. Jones has returned to work at the company. </TEXT></DOC>
