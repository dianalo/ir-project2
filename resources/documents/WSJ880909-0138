The Kurds, who live on the near edge of Europe, sided with Iran in the Gulf War and have long denied Baghdad control over the northeastern part of the country. The chance for Iraq to make good on its goal was provided by the July 18 cease-fire agreement with Iran. The next day, Iraq began its slaughter of the Kurds.    In the late stages of the Iran-Iraq war, the U.S. clearly tilted toward Iraq, minimizing, for instance, Iraq's missile attack against the Stark, which killed 37 U.S. sailors. Iraq's current attack on the Kurds, however, raises the question of whether the U.S. should continue to &quot;tilt&quot; toward an Iraq that under Saddam Hussein is simply beyond the pale.    According to Kurdish refugees fleeing into neighboring Turkey, hundreds have been killed and thousands wounded in the current campaign. An August 28 massacre of the Kurds near Dahuk is said to have left in mass graves 1,300 civilians, many of them women and children, in the Iraqi province of Kurdistan. More than 100,000 refugees have fled into Turkey.    President Hussein's bloody drive is quite in line with a political career that he began as a member of an assassination team. Since he seized power in 1968, leading a socialist-atheist Baath Party regime, his behavior has been consistent. Purges in the rigidly disciplined party have involved executions, including 22 senior members in 1979. In 1981, the government of Israel bombed and destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor. Is it possible to believe that Saddam Hussein, who has now gassed both the Kurds and Iranians, would be constrained from using a small nuclear device against Israel, the Kurds, Iran or any of his other perceived enemies?    Despite this history, countries in the West, such as the U.S., Britain and France, and Arab countries such as Jordan and Egypt have continued to let Mr. Hussein's seemingly flexible foreign policy obscure his true nature. This, coupled with a fear of Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution in Iran, led to the tilt toward Iraq in the Gulf War. It is a policy that leaves Iraq, formerly a small bully, as a large menace with a battle-hardened air force and an army of 50 divisions.    We now have the spectacle of the State Department, after early yesterday condemning the gassing, issuing a dreadful statement following Mr. Shultz's meeting with the Iraqi ambassador: &quot;We attach great importance to the further development of our relationship with Iraq, but . . . we do not intend to pursue this course if illegal Iraqi use of chemical weapons and other human rights abuses continue.&quot; So the Iraqis get away with their now-completed poison-gassing, and receive American assurances of better days to come.    The policy of maintaining a belligerent Iraq as a counterbalance to Iran in effect makes the the West and moderate Arab states allies of Saddam Hussein. The current Kurdish episode should serve to sort which governments in the region deserve their moral, financial and military support and which do not. </TEXT></DOC>
