The shiny CDsare sleek new laser plastics not likely to be recycledbecause the music -- whether Beethoven or Bon Jovi -- is notlikely to be discarded.   You should also know that these small, optical prerecordeddiscs are also being widely introduced as CD ROMs, with 1,000times the capacity of standard prerecorded data-storage discsfor personal computers. A larger laser disc (videodisc)format with interactive video is capable of 5,000 timestoday's capacity.</LP><TEXT>   CD ROMs can be far cheaper than today's computer discs ortheir drives of equal capacity. Although introductory pricesfor CD ROM players have been higher, within a few months theywill likely decline to substantially less (about $500). Thesenew devices are easily connected to desktop computers alreadyin use. Are we ready to use 1,000 to 5,000 times the infoavailable last week? Our educational missions will bechallenged sharply by increased demands for machines,materials and the production of specially formattedinteractive video.   There is one desktop computer for every three adults aged18 to 64 in the U.S., a ratio that likely will double overthe next five years. You can bet that in 10 years, or soonthereafter, there will be nearly as many personal computersas adults. New educational initiatives are necessary to helpour students best cope with the wrenching changes resultingin the school, home and office. Alas, the CD &quot;weeds&quot; willeven be in every editorial office.   Glenn Ralston   Indianapolis</TEXT></DOC>
