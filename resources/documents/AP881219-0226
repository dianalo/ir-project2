Dr. Jose Azocar compared pap smear samples from the prostituteswith those of Piaroa women, part of a strictly monogamous group thatlives in traditional villages scattered in this South Americannation's Amazon jungle.   ``With this study the relation between the HPV virus and cervicalcancer is strengthened, as is the hypothesis that the mode oftransmission is sexual,'' said Azocar, a virologist with theVenezuelan Scientific Research Institute.   As early as the 1950s scientists observed that higher levels ofcervical cancer seemed to be associated with promiscuity. A solidlink between the human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancerwasn't made until the early 1980s by Harald Zur Hausen of Germanyand Ralph Richart of Columbia University. Using genetic engineeringto manipulate infected DNA, they found that the viruses most relatedto cervical cancer were certain strains of HPV. Later research usinggenetic material from the viruses confirmed their results.   In 1985, Azocar began a similar study using viral geneticmaterial in cell samples from Caracas hospitals, and found thatnearly 80 percent of cervical cancers in Venezuela were associatedwith HPV. Cancer is the No. 2 killer in Venezuela, and cervicalcancer is the most common form in women.   ``It is widely accepted among scientists that HPV causes cervicalcancer, but it is thought that other factors are involved, includingmany births, early onset of sexual activity, and promiscuity. Iwanted to see to what point these other factors were involved,''Azocar said in a recent interview.   Further study required control groups at the extremes of sexualactivity.   ``It's hard to find a control group of monogamous people, andwith the Piaroa the girls are married off for life as soon as theyget their first period,'' Azocar said. ``The only thing theyrequired was that all the examinations be done by womengynecologists.''   Getting to the Piaroa, who had participated in an earlier AIDSstudy, was difficult. The 7,000-member tribe lives in an area thesize of Austria roughly between the Parguaza River in southwestBolivar State and the town of Tama-Tama in Amazonas FederalTerritory.   Most still live in villages of less than 100. They fish, huntsmall animals and birds and cultivate tubers and bananas as theyhave for hundreds of years. Those in less remote villages may haveoutboard motors for their canoes and wear western-style clothes, buttheir limited exposure to modern society ensures that theirmonogamous lifestyle is intact.   Men of status may have two wives, but most have just one. Thereis no one from outside the village to fool around with, and tribalwomen are kicked out if they sleep with someone other than theirhusbands.   Azocar and his colleagues were flown by army helicopter to threevillages near the Parguaza River, 290 miles south of Caracas, wherethey took samples from 125 women. No evidence of HPV or cervicalcancer was found.   Examining a promiscuous group was easier. He conducted atwo-month campaign among prostitutes in several cities nearestPiaroa territory for a cervical screening program and freetreatment. Police helped spread the word.   A team of gynecologists took pap smears from 130 prostitutes.Between 25 percent and 40 percent, depending on the city they livedin, had HPV, and among these there was a high incidence of differentgrades of pre-cancerous tumors.   Both the Piaroa and prostitutes began having sex early, hadmultiple births, similar blood lines, live in the same climate, eatsimilar foods and are exposed to roughly the same frontier-styleliving conditions.   Sexually speaking, the major difference was the frequency of sex,Azocar said. ``We showed that women who had many children and whostarted sex at an early age didn't necessarily have HPV. Thisprovides solid data that cervical cancer is a sexually transmitteddisease _ that the virus is the most important factor causing it andthat promiscuity is the form of infection.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
