In the next 20 years, the nation's emissions of so-calledgreenhouse gases could be slashed 10% to 40% at little or nocost because there would be offsetting energy savings,according to an academy study.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Despite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is apotential threat sufficient to justify action now,&quot; concludedfour prestigious panels of scientists, engineers andeconomists. They recommended wide-ranging steps, includingusing current technology to boost the energy efficiency ofcars, buildings and equipment, planting trees and paintingroofs white to reflect heat.   Congress requested the report in 1988 in the face ofconflicting scientific views over whether the Earth isexperiencing a dangerous warming because of a buildup ofheat-trapping, man-made gases in the atmosphere. While thereport doesn't go as far as some environmentalists wouldlike, it debunks arguments that the cost of combating globalwarming would be so great that action should be deferreduntil there is concrete evidence the problem exists.   It calls for quicker and more extensive action than theBush administration favors. That could add to pressure for apolicy change in the White House. But White House scienceadviser D. Allan Bromley argued there are more similaritiesthan differences between the report and administrationpolicies, which he said would lead to a cut of 20% to 25% inemissions.   The panel didn't settle the scientific debate over whetherglobal warming is real. &quot;What we are saying is that itdoesn't make much difference who is right and who is wrong,&quot;said former U.S. Sen. Daniel Evans, an engineer whosupervised the drafting of the report. &quot;If you believe thereis sufficient possibility that severe global warming isahead, you ought to buy an insurance policy.&quot;   Meanwhile, an international group of scientists discoveredanother piece of evidence that warming may be occurring. Apaper by Arthur Aiken of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and others found temperature changes in themiddle atmosphere over the past 10 years that are consistentwith what computers predict would occur with global warming.</TEXT></DOC>
