The ORC process and itscomponents are explained (organic working fluids, organic Rankine cycle),as are the properties of working fluids (thermal and caloric state variables,transport variables) and the effects of various parameters on the process.Hints are given for the selection of working fluids. The experimentalfacility is described. Calculations, design and performance of ORC systemsfor internal combustion engines are presented, e.g., energetic optimisation,component design, performance, and economic aspects. Each working fluidwas found to be optimum only for a given temperature range. At exhausttemperatures of 350 to 450/sup 0/C, the best results were achieved withwater. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
