All patients underwentstudies with xenon inhalation, Technegas inhalation, and macroaggregatedalbumin perfusion. Technegas is a new ultrafine ventilatory agent witha particle size of 50 to 200A produced from technetium pertechnetateand graphite in an argon environment. Although particulate in nature,Technegas is transported and diffuses like a gaseous agent. Its productionresults in a high specific activity yield with high efficiency. Thereis no significant deposition in the central airways, and good peripheralvisualization of the lung is obtained. The study was designed to assesswhether Technegas could be used as a ventilatory agent to obtain high-qualitydiagnostic images. All studies were reported as in normal clinical practice,and no statistical analysis was performed. The aim of the study was simplyto see what role Technegas had in a busy clinical department and howwell it reflected ventilation by comparison with xenon. Patient compliancewith Technegas was 100 percent and for xenon was 94 percent. Technegasenables one to obtain high-quality ventilatory images and has an importantrole to play in the assessment of pulmonary ventilation.</TEXT></DOC>
