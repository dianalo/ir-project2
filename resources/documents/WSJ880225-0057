Mike Gale, the Hong Kong director of Cable andamp; Wireless, said the consortium would purchase the Westar VI satellite from Merrett Ltd., an insurance-underwriting syndicate. The satellite originally was sent into space in 1984 and was salvaged by the U.S. space shuttle a year later after failing to reach a stable orbit. Mr. Gale said the satellite would be relaunched by China's Long March III rocket in April 1989.    China International Trust andamp; Investment, the foreign-investment arm of the Chinese government, arranged for priority launch status, Mr. Gale said. China's launch program is among those that have competed for business diverted by the halt of the U.S. space-shuttle program after the Challenger explosion in January 1986.    Mr. Gale said the three partners would hold equal shares in the new consortium and finance the project with equity and debt. Officials of the group said the initial cost of the operation would be between $140 million and $150 million.    Mr. Gale predicted the venture would break even after about four years. He said the group was talking to one or two countries, in addition to China, about purchasing the group's services.    This project is the first cooperative effort between Cable andamp; Wireless and Hutchison Whampoa, which are bidding against each other for the right to build Hong Kong's first cable-television system. Mr. Gale said further cooperation among the partners is possible. </TEXT></DOC>
