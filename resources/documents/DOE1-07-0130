A piezoelectricmember for detecting the load generated upon uprise of the index tubeis disposed and signals from the piezoelectric member is connected toa calculation processing device. A load exerted when the index tube uprisesis measured by way of the piezoelectric member upon scram thereby judgingthe absence or presence of the decelerating operation. Therefore, thenuclear reactor can be shutdown only when it is required with no excesssafety operation than required. As a result, the reactor availabilitycan be improved and, in addition, it is also possible to mitigate theburden of in-service inspection and reduce the operators' exposure.
