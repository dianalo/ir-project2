Now, as director of the U.S. Information Agency and chief U.S.negotiator in talks aimed at increasing the flow of informationbetween the superpowers, the Russian phrase he hears most often is``Why not?''   Gelb and Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Petrovsky saythe latest round of U.S.-Soviet information talks, which openedMonday, have cleared the way for signing two cultural agreements atthe superpower summit planned for June in the United States.   One deal would allow the U.S. and Soviet governments to opencultural centers in each other's capitals, Petrovsky said.   The second, on President Bush's ``open lands'' proposal, wouldreduce restrictions on U.S. and Soviet diplomats and journalistsworking in each other's countries, Gelb said in an interview in hisoffice Tuesday.   The mood of the current information talks is considerablyfriendlier than the first round two years ago when Gelb'spredecessor, Charles Wick, stormed out of a meeting in Moscow afterSoviets accused U.S. scientists of inventing AIDS.   U.S. officials have complained for years that Soviet mediacarried ``disinformation,'' of which the AIDS allegation was themost famous example. Gelb says such Soviet activities ``havedropped down to an extremely low level.''   Mutual recriminations have not disappeared from the talks, but``virtually every one of the problems here has been described as amosquito that should be swatted,'' Gelb said.   During this round, the Soviets complained that Voice of America,a USIA radio station, broadcast inflammatory remarks in Januaryduring unrest in Azerbaijan, a mostly Moslem republic on the Sovietborder with Iran.   ``We are looking into it,'' Gelb said.   Soviet officials want to remove barriers to information from theWest because ``they now realize that they can't keep informationout,'' Gelb said.   Moreover, they want to learn how the West works. The informationtalks this week included a working group on U.S. public opinionsurveys, and the Soviets have asked to send observers to a meetingof the U.S. National Association of Broadcasters later this year,Gelb said.   The thirst for knowledge in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europeis straining U.S. resources.   USIA runs a $6 million program to foster democracy andcapitalism in Poland and Hungary, but that is far from enough.   ``Right now, we have the resources to get halfway across theditch. We must scramble up the other side,'' Gelb said.   Among the other developments at the information talks, theSoviets have agreed to stop unlicensed medium-wave broadcasts fromCuba to the United States and are ready to lift a ceiling of150,000 on copies of the USIA Russian-language magazine ``America''distributed in the Soviet Union.   The Soviets also appear ready to allow a second VOAcorrespondent to work in Moscow, said Gelb. Before the reforms, VOAreporters were not allowed in the Soviet Union, and the radiostation was regularly condemned by official Soviet media.</TEXT></DOC>
