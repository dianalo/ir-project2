This paper represents some of the sampling methodologycurrently being developed for use during OSE inspections. Topics includepopulation definition, sample size requirements, level of confidenceand practical logistical constraints associated with the conduct of aninspection based on random sampling. Sequential sampling schemes andsampling from finite populations are also discussed. The methods describedare applicable to various data gathering activities, ranging from thesampling and examination of classified documents to the sampling of ProtectiveForce security inspectors for skill testing.</TEXT></DOC>
