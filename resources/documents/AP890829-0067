(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moldavians today pushed forward inparliamentary debate on a new draft law to make the local dialectthe official language of the republic, but non-Moldavian strikersand protesters charged the measure was discriminatory.   In the restive Baltics, an activist said Monday that PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev cautioned Communist Party officials inLithuania against pushing too hard for autonomy.   The legislature of the southern Soviet republic voted 300 to 43not to delay debate on the bill, despite objections by deputies fromtwo cities where 80,000 non-Moldavian workers have been strikingsince last week to protest the law. Three deputies abstained and 30were absent.   The vote on the bill was expected by Wednesday.   Around Kishinev, capital of this republic on the Romanian border,viewers watched the session on television in both Russian andMoldavian, a Romanian dialect.   The Russians, Ukrainians and other ethnic groups comprise morethan a third of the republic's population.   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Monday that ethnicactivists in Moldavia are trying to ``take power on the crest of amuddy wave of chauvinism and separatism.''   Moldavian activists said the opera theater where the lawmakingbody was meeting was ringed by police as several hundred peoplegathered across the street waving red-blue-and-yellow banners of therepublic's colors.   Gorbachev called Lithuania's party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, onFriday and Sunday to express his concern about the independencemovement in the republic, activist Romaldus Olozus said.   On Saturday, the Communist Party Central Committee in Moscow saidseparatists were leading the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latviaand Estonia toward trouble. The statement came days after 1 millionBaltic people joined hands in a chain to protest the 1939 agreementbetween Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler that forced the independentBaltics in the Soviet sphere of influence.   Olozus, a member of the governing council of the Sajudisgrassroots movement, said in a telephone interview from Vilnius thathe and four colleagues met with Brazauskas on Monday.   Brazauskas told the Sajudis members, ``Gorbachev is concernedabout what's happening in Lithuania _ that what had happened so farwas worth supporting, but that now we'd gone too far,'' Olozus saidby telephone.   No special meeting of Sajudis was planned to discuss the Kremlinreaction, but Sajudis Chairman Vytautus Landsbergis was scheduled tospeak tonight on Lithanian television, Olozus said.   Estonian Communist Party chief Vaino Vyalyas said the republic'sparty agreed with the Central Committee's assessment that the Balticregion was in danger of falling into ``an abyss'' if they heededseparatist calls for secession, Tass reported today.   The government of Lithuania and the Communist Party of the thirdBaltic republic, Latvia, came into line Monday behind the statementfrom Moscow.   The Tass news agency said the Latvian party issued a statementcalling the party's stance ``the basis for concrete action fornormalizing the social-political situation in the country.''   In Lithuania, the presidium of the republic's Supreme Sovietlegislature rejected a commission's findings that the incorporationof Lithuania into the Soviet Union by Stalin in 1940 was an``international crime.''   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said the findings didnot take into account Lithuania's political situation in 1939-40,and would ``lead the republic into a political dead-end and servepoorly in the transfer to economic independence.''   It returned the Supreme Soviet commission's work until a nationalpanel finishes its review, Izvestia said.   Olozus said Gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings ofthe Lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legalargument for full independence.   Olozus said he had an impression from talking to Brazauskas thatGorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the CentralCommittee statement, but that ``his reaction was one ofdisappointment.''   The confrontation with the Kremlin was ``inescapable,'' but theresistance might slow down the Sajudis-led drive for greaterautonomy, if not outright independence from Moscow, Olozus said.   The grass-roots movement will continue on the same path, ``butthe steps can be slower or faster, depending on the concretesituation,'' he said.   The labor daily Trud today attacked Moldavian nationalists,saying they ``stepped up bitterness, mutual hostility andsuspicion'' among ethnic groups.   Representatives of the Moldavian People's Front on Monday metleaders of a council representing non-Moldavian workers who havebeen on strike since last week to protest the draft language law,Tass reported.   On Sunday, up to 300,000 people rallied in Kishinev in favor ofthe language law.   Pravda on Monday said that the crowd drawn to Kishinev's LeninSquare on Sunday by the People's Front had ``submitted to long-termbrainwashing by nationalist-minded ideologists.''   Non-Moldavians are concerned the language law will be the firststep toward a policy of discriminating against non-Moldavians.</TEXT></DOC>
