Hawkins-RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988,Pub. L. 100-297. Principal themes of this new legislation are to promoteaccess to quality education for educationally deprived students and excellencein education for the Nation as a whole. In keeping with these themes, TitleI of the Hawkins-Stafford Act amends the Elementary and Secondary EducationAct of 1965 (ESEA) (the Act) to include a number of new and reauthorizedFederal education programs. One of these programs is Chapter 1 of TitleI of the ESEA, which reauthorizes programs previously contained in Chapter1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA). PartA of Chapter 1, which is implemented by these final regulations, providesfinancial assistance through SEAs to LEAs to meet the special educationalneeds of educationally deprived children in school attendance areas withhigh concentrations of children from low-income families and of childrenin local institutions for neglected or delinquent children. This assistanceis to improve the educational opportunities of educationally deprived childrenby helping these children succeed in the regular program, attain grade-levelproficiency, and improve achievement in basic and more advanced skills.Part A of Chapter 1 also provides financial assistance to the U.S. Secretaryof the Interior to meet the special educational needs of educationallydeprived Indian children. On October 21, 1988, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 41466-41492). The preamble to the NPRMincluded a discussion of the provisions enacted by the Congress to strengthenand improve the program. The preamble also included a summary of the resultsof the regional meetings and modified negotiated rulemaking process theSecretary implemented as a result of the requirements of section 1431(b)of the Act. In developing proposed regulations for the targeting of schoolattendance areas and students, schoolwide projects, parental involvement,program improvement, State administration, and national evaluation standards,the Secretary considered the comments and recommendations of participantsin the regional meetings and the modified negotiated rulemaking process.The preamble also included a summary of other significant changes resultingfrom reauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="84">Major Changes from the NPRM </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 453 letters werereceived from State and local educational agency officials, teachers, organizations,and Members of Congress. In general, the comments addressed significantissues on the requirements for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluatingprograms and projects under this part. Many commenters attempted to seekchanges from a local, a State, or an interest group perspective. Commentsclustered around the issues addressed in the regional meetings and thenegotiated rulemaking demonstration, including issues that did not resultin concensus by the negotiating group. In issues were complex and couldnot be decided easily. The final regulations, therefore, represent theSecretary's attempt to balance the concerns of States, local school officals,and the varous interest groups against the statutory purposes for the programand the needs of the children to be served. The following sections providea brief summary of the final regulations that are significantly differentfrom the NPRM: What Definitions Apply to the Chapter 1 LEA Program? (andSection; 200.6)The Secretary received a number of comments concerning the proposed definitionof ``in loco parentis,'' particularly the provision concerning the designationof persons to act in place of the parent or legal guardian. Some commentersbelieved that all persons standing ``in loco parentis'' had to be designatedto do so by a parent or legal guardian; others wanted that designationto be in writing. Section 200.6(c) revises the definition of ``in locoparentis'' to make clear that a person standing in place of parent maybe either a person with whom a child lives or a person who has been designatedby a parent or legal guardian to act in place of the parent or legal guardianregarding all aspects of the child's education. The intent of this provisionis to identify the person most responsible for the overall education ofthe child. Typically, this person would be the person with whom the childlives and need not be designated. However, in some instances, the parentor legal guardian may wish another person to be responsible for the child'seducation, including the Chapter 1 LEA Program. This person must be designatedby the parent or legal guardian. However, it is not the intent of the regulationsthat the designation of a person ``in loco parentis'' be for the Chapter1 LEA Program only, with the parent or legal guardian retaining parentalauthority in regard to the regular program of instruction in the school.The regulations do not require that this designation be in writing. Rather,the general practices of an LEA would govern whether the designation ofa person standing ``in loco parentis'' must be in writing. How Does an LEA apply for a Subgrant? (andSection; 200.20) There are three major changes concerning the contents of an LEA's applicationfor funds. First, the proposed regulations required that an LEA's applicationinclude data showing that the LEA maintained fiscal effort in accordancewith andSection; 200.41. In response to a number of comments received, andSection;200.20(a)(7) has been revised to require the data only if the appropriateexpenditure information is not already available to the SEA. Second, the proposed regulations required that an application include anassurance that the LEA is in compliance with the comparability of servicesrequirements in andSection; 200.43(c)(1)(i) and a copy of the LEA's salaryschedule and policies required by that provision. In response to commentson these requirements, andSection; 200.20(a)(8) has been revised to deletethe requirement that the LEA's salary schedule and policies be includedin the application. In addition, the assurance concerning comparabilityof services is only required of those LEAs that elect to file a writtenassurance rather than establishing and implementing other measures of comparableservices. Third, the proposed regulations required that an application include anassurance that the LEA's Chapter 1 projects provide for the allocationof time and resources for coordination of the Chapter 1 curriculum withthe regular instructional program. In response to public comment, andSection;200.20(a)(10)(i)(D) has been revised to clarify that the coordination isbetween Chapter 1 staff and regular staff to ensure that both the Chapter1 and regular instructional programs meet the special educational needsof Chapter 1 children. How Does an LEA Identify and Select Children to Participate? (andSection;200.31) Section 200.31(b)(1) of the proposed regulations required that an LEA conductan annual needs assessment that identifies educationally deprived childrenin all eligible attendance areas, including educationally deprived childrenin private schools. Section 200.31(b)(2) of the proposed regulations alsorequired that the LEA identify the general instructional areas on whichthe program will focus. The final regulations have been revised to clarifythat an LEA must identify general instructional areas and grade levelson which the program will focus on the basis of information on needs gatheredby identifying all educationally deprived children, including those childrenin private schools, in eligible areas. Further, andSection; 200.31(b)(2)has been modified to indicate that instructional areas and grade levelsserved may vary among and within school attendance areas if the needs assessmentdata support differing instructional areas and grades. What are the Requirements for Evaluating and Reporting Project Results?(andSection; 200.35) The proposed regulations permitted an SEA to require that an LEA's evaluationinclude an assessment of the effect of Chapter 1 projects on children'sachievement in the regular program, including writing, science, history,or other subjects. In response to public comment, the provision has beendeleted from andSection; 200.35(b). However, andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(ii) hasbeen added to clarify that an LEA must include in its evaluation a reviewof Chapter 1 children's progress in the regular program. The review maybe based on teacher judgments, grades, retention rates, and other appropriateindicators of success. In adding this provision, the Secretary does notintend to hold the Chapter 1 LEA Program accountable for the effectivenessof the LEA's regular program. However, one of the purposes of the Chapter1 LEA Program, as stated in section 1001(b)(1) of the Act, is to help educationallydeprived children succeed in the regular program of the LEA. It is insufficientthat Chapter 1 children make gains in the Chapter 1 program if those gainsdo not translate into improved performance in the regular program. Withoutreviewing Chapter 1 children's progress in the regular program, the LEAcannot truly measure the effectiveness of its Chapter 1 LEA Program. What are the Requirements for Schoolwide Projects? (andSection; 200.36) In accordance with section 1015(c)(2)(A) of the Act, the proposed regulationsprovided that, for each school that has a schoolwide project plan approvedby the SEA, and LEA does not have to comply with any Chapter 1 requirementsprohibiting the commingling of funds available under this part with Stateand local funds. The Secretary interprets this provision to mean that theLEA does not have to demonstrate that Chapter 1 funds benefit only educationallydeprived children. In response to public comment and upon further review,the Secretary has revised andSection; 200.36(d)(2)(i) to reflect this interpretation.The Secretary does not interpret the commingly provision in section 1015(c)(2)(A)to excuse an LEA from documenting separately that Chapter 1 funds have,in fact, been spent in a schoolwide project. Thus, andSection; 200.36(c)(5)has been added to the final regulations to clarify that, notwithstandingandSection; 200.36(d)(2), the LEA must keep records to document the expenditureof funds under this part in a schoolwide project. This requirement is necessaryto determine the LEA's compliance with the restrictions on carryover fundsandSection; 200.46 and the period of availability of funds under section412(b) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). What are an LEA's Responsibilities for Program Improvement? (andSection;200.38) The proposed regulations required that an SEA's and LEA's joint plan bedeveloped and implemented by the beginning of the school year followingthe full year the LEA's plan was in effect. Essentially, this provisionallowed, at most, only three months during the summer to develop and implementthe joint plan. It allowed no time for those LEAs on a fall-to-fall testingcycle. Thus, in response to numerous comments expressing concern that thetimeline in the proposed regulations was unrealistic, particularly becausemany staff members do not work during the summer, the Secretary has revisedandSection; 200.38(b)(6)(iii) to require a joint plan to be developed andfully implemented as soon as possible, but no later than by the beginningof the second school year following the full year during which the LEA'splan was in effect. However, the Secretary does not want this extensionto result in ineffective programs continuing for another full year to thedetriment of educationally deprived children. Therefore, if full implementationof a joint plan requires the maximum time allowed, andSection; 200.38(b)(6)(iii)(B)requires the SEA and LEA to implement portions of the plan as soon as possible.A similar requirement has also been added to the LEA's plan in andSection;200.38(b)(5)(ii)(B). In addition, the Secretary has added two definitions in andSection; 200.6(c)relating to program improvement. First, the Secretary has defined ``aggregateperformance'' to mean student achievement, aggregated for a school as awhole, measured in accordance with the national evaluation standards inSubpart H. Concomitantly, the Secretary has revised andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii)to indicate that an LEA, at a minimum, is required to determine the aggregateperformance of a school in the instructional area that is the primary focuson the Chapter 1 LEA Program in that school, unless the program addressestwo or more instructional areas wtih relatively equal emphasis. In thosecases, the LEA must determine aggregate performance in each area. if anLEA wishes, it may determine aggregate performance in all instructionalareas included in its Chapter 1 program and use the results for determiningschools in need of program improvement. Second, the Secretary has defined ``desired outcomes'' and has indicatedthat, at a minimum, and LEA's desired outcomes must be expressed in termsof aggregate performance in accordance with andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii).The LEA may also establish other desired outcomes that are expressed interms of indicators such as improved student performance measured by criterion-referencedtests, lower dropout rates, improved attendance, and fewer retentions ingrade. What Comparability of Services Requirements Apply to This Program? (andSection;200.43) The proposed regulations required that an LEA comply with the comparabilityof services requirements by establishing and implementing a districtwidesalary schedule, a policy to ensure equivalence in staffing schools, anda policy to ensure equivalence in the provision of materials and suppliesto schools. In addition, an SEA and LEA was required to establish standardsto ensure that the policies actually resulted in the provision of equivalentstaffing, materials, and supplies. In response to comments, the flexibilityprovided in the statute has been included in andSection; 200.43(c). Specifically,an LEA has the option of eiher (1) filing a written assurance that it hasestablished and implemented a districtwide salary schedule and policiesto ensure equivalence in staffing, materials, and supplies or (2) establishingand implementing other measures such as a ratio of students per instructionalstaff or a ratio of instructional staff salary expenditures per studentto demonstrate compliance with the comparability of services requirements.The requirement that an SEA or LEA establish standards to ensure that anLEA's policies result in the provision of equivalent staffing, materials,and supplies among schools has been deleted. However, andSection; 200.43(d)and andSection; 200.43(e) require an LEA to develop written procedures toensure compliance and to maintain annual records documenting compliancewith the comparability of services requirements. The requirement in andSection;200.21(a)(3) of the proposed regulations that an SEA had to determine,in aproving an LEA's application, that the LEA's salary schedule and policies,if implemented, would result in compliance with the comparability requirementshas also been deleted. However, the SEA is required under andSection; 200.43(f)(1)to monitor each LEA's compliance with the comparability requirements, andthe SEA remains ultimately responsible for violations of those requirements.Does a State Have Authority to Issue State Regulations for the Chapter1 LEA Program? (andSection; 200.70)The final regulations make a number of changes to the provisions concerningthe committee of practitioners in andSection; 200.70(e). Section 1451(b)of the Act requires review by a State committee of practitioners ``[b]eforepublication of any proposed or final State rule or regulation.'' The proposedregulations attempted to minimize any burden caused by this provision byonly requiring review by the committee of practitioners before publicationof either a proposed rule, if State law required issuance of proposed rules,or a final rule, if no proposed rule was required. Moreover, the proposedregulations did not require an SEA to convene the committee except afterthe issuance of an emergency rule where review prior to publication wasnot possible.On the basis of the comments received and upon reconsideration, the Secretaryhas revised andSection; 200.70(e) to require that a State convene the Statecommittee or practitioners to review before publication any major proposedor final rule or regulation. The State must also ensure that any otherrules or regulations be reviewed by the committee but not necessarily ina meeting. In addition, if a State does not issue rules or regulationsrelating to the Chapter 1 LEA Program but issues policies that the SEAand LEAs must follow, the State must comply with the consultation requirementsfor issuing rules and regulations in andSection; 200.70(e).What Complaint Procedures Must an SEA Adopt? (andSection; 200.72)Section 200.72 of the proposed regulations contained requirements concerningcomplaint procedures that each SEA would have to adopt. Those regulationswere developed, in part, in response to Congress' suggestion in the ConferenceReport accompanying the Act that the Secretary ``issue amended regulationsmaking 34 CFR 76.780-76.783 applicable to Chapter 1.'' <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rept. 567, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 341 (1978). However,subsequent to enactment of the Act but before the proposed Chapter 1 regulationswere published, the Secretary published an NPRM proposing changes to theEducation Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 31580 (Aug. 18, 1988). One of those proposed changeswas the removal of the general complaint procedures in 34 CFR 76.780-76.782of EDGAR and the transfer of those procedures to the regulations implementingPart B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, which had shown the greatestneed for the complaint procedures. As a result, the Secretary proposedseparate Chapter 1 complaint procedures. In response to comments on theEDGAR NPRM, the Secretary is reconsidering whether to remove the complaintprocedures from EDGAR. Because this issue has not yet been resolved, theSecretary has decided on an interim basis to make the general complaintprocedures from EDGAR applicable to the Chapter 1 LEA Program. For theconvenience of SEAs, LEAs, and other interested parties, the proceduresare included in andSection;andSection; 200.73-200.75. However, paragraphs (b)and (c) of andSection; 76.780 are not included as the statutory referencesare no longer appropriate. In addition, the acronyms ``SEA'' and ``LEA''replace the terms ``State'' and ``subgrantee'' to be consistent with theremaining regulations under this part. Comments received on the proposedChapter 1 complaint procedures will be given additional consideration inwhatever final action the Secretary takes regarding the EDGAR complaintprocedures.How Does an LEA Evaluate Student Achievement? (andSection; 200.80)Both the proposed regulations and andSection; 200.80(b)(2) of these finalregulations require that an LEA report achievement data on either a spring-to-springor fall-to-fall testing interval. In response to many comments received,andSection; 200.80(b)(2) has been revised to allow an LEA that measured studentson a fall-spring testing interval during the 1988-89 school year to continueto do so for one more year (the 1989-90 school year) if the SEA determinesthat implementation of the annual cycle in 1989-90 would impose a substantialhardship on the LEA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicability of EDGAR</ITAG>In order to provide additional guidance and to ensure that Chapter 1 fundsare spent only for authorized program purposes, the Secretary proposedto make certain provisions of EDGAR applicable to programs under this part.Several comments were received on this proposal, most of which supportedthe applicability of EDGAR. As a result, the final regulations apply selectedprovisions of EDGAR to programs under this part.In determining which provisions to apply, the Secretary carefully balancedthe need for basic program accountability with the important principleof minimum Federal interference in State and local affairs. In particular,the final regulations allow States to use their own procedures to ensureaccountability with respect to matters governed by two Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) circulars: A-102 (Uniform Administrative Requirementsfor Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments),currently codified for programs of the Department of Education in 34 CFRPart 80; and A-87 (Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Grantsand Contracts with State and Local Governments) as amended on January 28,1981. Only if a State chooses not to apply its own procedures would theprovisions in these circulars apply to the Chapter 1 LEA Program.If a State wishes to use its own procedures instead of the two OMB circularsimplemented in EDGAR, the final regulations require that the State's proceduresmeet three general criteria, set forth in andSection; 200.5(a)(4) (i)-(iii),that are designed to ensure the minimal standards necessary for propermanagement of Chapter 1 funds. A State may adopt new procedures, or mayuse accountability procedures applicable to the use of its own funds, ifthose procedures meet the general criteria. The State's procedures do nothave to be submitted to the Secretary for approval, but must be availablefor Federal inspection. If a State does not have its own written requirementsimplemented by July 1, 1989, but wishes to develop them, the requirementsin Part 80 apply until such time as the State's written requirements areadopted. In the event a State's requirements are determined to be insufficient,the enforcement provisions in Part E of GEPA apply, including the due processprovisions in that part. During the transition period provided for in section1491(c) of the Act, a State may continue to comply with the requirementsunder Chapter 1 of the ECIA.The Secretary wishes to emphasize that States have complete discretion,subject to meeting the general criteria set forth in andSection; 200.5(a)(4)(i)-(iii), to use their own procedures instead of the procedures in thetwo OMB circulars. Moreover, Circular A-102 has recently been revised topermit States to apply their own procedures to LEAs. As a result, evenif a State chooses to adopt the procedures in that circular, it would stillhave considerable flexibility in determining the appropriate standardsfor accountability at the local level. Circular A-87 is currently beingrevised.In addition, the final regulations make applicable a limited number ofprovisions in Part 76 (State-Administered Programs); Part 77 (DefinitionsThat Apply to Department Regulations); Part 78 (Education Appeal Board);and Part 81 (General Education Provisions Act_Enforcement). The Secretarybelieves these minimal requirements will help to ensure basic accountabilitywithout imposing undue burden and paperwork on SEAs and LEAs.Several of the applicable provisions in Part 76 contain cross-referencesto 34 CFR Part 74, which was superseded by Part 80 on October 1, 1988 withrespect to State and local governments. Under andSection; 200.5(a)(4), aState may decide to adopt its own written fiscal and administrative requirements,rather than following those in Part 80. The outdated cross-references toPart 74 (now Part 80) in Part 76 are not intended to make any provisionsof Part 80 applicable to programs under this part that a State has not,on its own, decided to apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedures for Bypass</ITAG>Under a number of elementary and secondary education programs reauthorizedby the Hawkins-Stafford Act_namely, Chapters 1 and 2 of Title I of theESEA, as amended, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science EducationAct, and Part B of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986_theSecretary is authorized to waive the requirements for providing servicesto private school children and to implement a bypass. Rather than repeatingthe same procedures in a number of sets of regulations, the Secretary addsprocedures for bypass in andSection;andSection; 76.671-76.677 of EDGAR thatapply to each program listed in andSection; 76.670.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cooperation with Audits</ITAG>These regulations include two new sections concerning cooperation withaudits that are added to parts 75 and 76 of EDGAR, respectively. Thesesections make clear that grantees and subgrantees must cooperate with theSecretary and the Comptroller General of the United States or their authorizedrepresentatives in the conduct of audits. The language in Parts 75 and76 makes clear that a grantee's or subgrantee's obligation to cooperatewith audits means not imposing unreasonable restrictions on access to recordsand personnel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Removal of Part 204</ITAG>Part 204, which contained general definitions and administrative, project,fiscal, and due process requirements for all Chapter 1 programs is removed.All common requirements are either in applicable EDGAR provisions or areincluded in the regulations implementing each specific Chapter 1 program,thereby reducing the number of documents with which an SEA or LEA mustdeal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 453 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe Secretary's responses to those comments is published as an appendixto these final regulations. Substantive issues are discussed under thesection of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minorchanges and some suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorizedto make under the applicable statutory authority are not addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12606</ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these regulations have been reviewed in accordancewith Executive Order 12606 and that they do not have a significant negativeimpact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. To thecontrary, the Chapter 1 LEA Program supports and strengthens the familyby containing strong parental involvement requirements. Specifically, anLEA must develop, in coordination with parents of participating children,programs, activities, and procedures to: Inform parents about the Chapter1 LEA Program; support the efforts of parents, including training parents,to work with their children at home; train teachers and other staff towork effectively with parents; consult with parents on an ongoing basis;and provide opportunities for the full participation of parents who lackliteracy skills or whose native language is not English.

(ii) In assessing achievement in language arts, and LEA may use tests designedto measure language arts or reading. If a reading test is used, the LEAshall assess achievement in both basic and more advanced skills. (2) With regard to more advanced skills, the LEA shall assess the progressof Chapter 1 participants as measured by_ (1) (A) The ``comprehension'' or equivalent score of a nationally normedreading test; and (B) The ``problems and applications'' or equivalent score of a nationallynormed mathematics test; or (ii) A test without national norms if_ (A) It is the instrument used for other required achievement reportingunder this part; (B) It provides an appropriate ``comprehension'' and ``problems and applications''score; and (C) The LEA meets the conditions in andSection; 200.82(b)(2).

(ii) An LEA that measured achievement on a fall-spring testing intervalduring the 1988-89 school year may continue to do so for one additionalyear only (the 1989-90 school year) if the SEA determines that implementationof the annual cycle in 1989-90 would impose a substantial hardship on theLEA.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example: </T4>An LEA uses the results of a pre-test administered inSeptember 1988 and a post-test administered in May 1989 to measure andreport on the achievement of children participating in projects under thispart during the 1988-89 school year. The SEA determines that it would bea substantial hardship for the LEA to measure and report on children'sachievement for the 1989-90 school year on either a spring-to-spring orfall-to-fall testing interval. Therefore, the LEA may continue to reporton participating children's achievement on a fall-spring testing intervalfor the 1989-90 school year. However, the LEA must report on participatingchildren's achievement in school year 1990-91 using either: pre-tests administeredduring the fall of 1990 and post-tests administered during the fall of1991; or pre-tests administered during the spring of 1990 and post-testsadministered during the spring of 1991.</ITAG>(c)(1) At least once during the three-year evaluation period required underandSection; 200.35(a), the LEA shall collect additional information to determinewhether student achievement gains are sustained over a period of more than12 months (see andSection; 200.35(a)(2)).(2) The LEA shall report this information on either a spring-spring-springtesting interval or a fall-fall-fall testing interval.

Commenters were concernedthat the reference to ``grade level proficiency'' may perpetuate measurementof gains on the basis of grade equivalents, which research indicates areless valid and reliable than other measures. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.1 of the regulations sets forth the purposeof the Chapter 1 Program in Local Educational Agencies and, basically,repeats the language in section 1001(b) of the Act. The intent of andSection;200.1 is to state the purpose for the Federal financial assistance andnot to provide specific indicators of program effectiveness. In andSection;200.6(c) of the regulations, the terms ``aggregate performance'' and ``desiredoutcomes'' are defined. The latter definition includes a list of possibleindicators for measuring program effectiveness. The list includes criterion-referencedtests, lower dropout rates, and improved attendance. <T3>Changes: </T3>No change has been made to andSection; 200.1, but definitionsfor the terms ``aggregate performance'' and ``desired outcomes'' have beenadded in andSection; 200.6(c). Section 200.3 Who is Eligible for a Subgrant? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended clarifying that the types ofsubgrants_basic and concentration grants_are allocations rather than subgrants,and that the LEA actually applies for and receives a single grant. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Although sections 1005 and 1006 of the Act refer to``basic grants'' and ``grants for local educational agencies in countieswith especially high concentrations of children from low-income families,''an LEA does not receive two separate grants. Section 200.3 of the regulationsreflects the statutory language by referring to the two allocations asgrants. However, an LEA submits a single application for funds under bothauthorizations and is not required to account separately for the amountsreceived under the two allocations. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.4 What King of Activities May an LEA Conduct? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter felt that, because a librarian and a libraryserve the entire school, acquiring books and library materials and traininglibrarians would dilute funds from benefitting educationally deprived children.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The intent of andSection; 200.4(c) is to demonstratethe range of activities that may be supported with funds under this part.The activities, however, are authorized only if the services, materials,and staff members paid for with grant funds are used to meet the specialeducational needs of educationally deprived children. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.4(c) has been revised to clarify that allthe authorized activities must meet the special educational needs of educationallydeprived children. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that, to be consistent withthe definition of ``pupil services personnel'' in section 1471 of the Act,school psychologists and school social workers be mentioned at the beginningof the regulations. One of these commenters offered a lengthier list ofpersons who comprise pupil services personnel. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Since section 1471 of the Act includes school counselors,school social workers, and school psychologists in the definition of ``pupilservices personnel,'' the Secretary does not believe the regulations needto repeat the list in andSection; 200.4(c). However, the Secretary has addedpupil services personnel to other sections of the regulations to emphasizetheir possible contribution to Chapter 1 projects. <T3>Changes: </T3>Sections 200.20(a)(10), 200.34(c), and 200.34(e) havebeen revised to include pupil services personnel. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that language be added to andSection;200.4(d) to state that the 5 percent limitation for innovation projectsdoes not preclude using other funds to carry out these activities. Anothercommenter questioned whether regular Chapter 1 funds may be used for trainingnon-Chapter 1 paid staff who serve educationally deprived children. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Chapter 1 funds may be used for activities containedin andSection; 200.4(c) of the regulations. In most circumstances, thesewould include the activities contained in andSection; 200.4(d)(2) (iii)-(vii),but not andSection; 200.4(d) (i) and (ii). Permitting the LEA to use up toand including 5 percent of its allocation for innovation projects is anincentive for LEAs to devote resources to improve the quality of the programand provide additional flexibility. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the general project resourceallocation procedures for LEAs in andSection; 200.33 are inconsistent withthe innovation project provisions of andSection; 200.4(d). <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that one of the purposes ofinnovation projects is to provide the LEA with additional flexibility toimprove the quality of the Chapter 1 LEA Program. Therefore, the allocationof resources under andSection; 200.4(d) may not be consistent with the allocationof resources under andSection; 200.33. However, the decision to conduct aninnovation project is left to the discretion of the LEA. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the provision of continuedservices for participants who are transferred to ineligible areas or schoolsas part of a desegregation plan in andSection; 200.4(d)(2)(ii) be clarifiedto indicate that the provision may be used in conjunction with andSection;200.31(c)(1), which allows the continuation of services during the sameschool year.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that a participant may continueto be served during the remainder of the school year in which the transferoccurs and up to two additional years under an innovation project. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.4(d)(2)(ii) has been changed by adding theword ``additional'' to the provision. Section 200.5 What Regulations Apply to the Chapter 1 LEA Program? <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters noted that this section was helpfulbut requested that the Department, in addition to using CFR (Code of FederalRegulations) citations, list the <T4>Federal Register </T4>citation for each regulation including day, month,year, and page number. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Amendments to the CFR are made periodically. Therefore,if <T4>Federal Register </T4>citations were included in the regulations, theywould soon be out of date and readers may infer incorrectly that laterchanges would not apply to the program. In addition to publishing changesin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Department notifies SEAs of all changesto the regulations. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters provided positions on the applicabilityof EDGAR, suggesting that States must follow the cost principles and guidelinesof EDGAR; that States should use their own financial management procedures;or that either all of EDGAR should apply or notations should be made tothe extent it does not apply. One commenter suggested exactly what wasproposed. In addition, commenters requested clarification regarding therelationship of the requirements in EDGAR and Chapter 1 in the followingareas: Definition of equipment, particularly the increase in applicableacquisition cost; time and effort flexibility; line item budget changes;carryover; and financial reports from LEAs. <T3>Discussion: </T3>In order to provide additional guidance and to ensurethat Chapter 1 funds are spent only for authorized program purposes, theSecretary has made certain provisions of EDGAR applicable to programs underthis part. In determining which provisions to apply, the Secretary carefullybalanced the need for basic program accountability with the important principleof minimum Federal interference in State and local affairs. In particular,the final regulations allow States to use their own procedures to ensureaccountability with respect to matters governed by two Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) circulars: A-102 (Uniform Administrative Requirementsfor Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments),codified for programs of the Department in 34 CFR Part 80; and A-87 (Principlesfor Determining Costs Applicable to Grants and Contracts with State andLocal Governments) as amended on January 28, 1981. Only if a State choosesnot to apply its own procedures would the provisions in these parts ofEDGAR apply to the Chapter 1 LEA Program. If a State wishes to use its own procedures instead of the two OMB circularsimplemented in EDGAR, the final regulations require that the State's proceduresmeet three general criteria, set forth in andSection; 200.5(a)(4)(i)-(iii),that are designed to ensure the minimal standards necessary for propermanagement of Chapter 1 funds. A State may adopt new procedures, or mayuse accountability procedures applicable to the use of its own funds, ifthose procedures meet the general criteria. The State's procedures do nothave to be submitted to the Secretary for approval, but must be availablefor Federal inspection. If a State does not have its own written requirementsimplemented by July 1, 1989, but wishes to develop them, the requirementsin Part 80 and Appendix C to Part 74 apply until such time as the State'swritten requirements are adopted. In the event a State's requirements aredetermined to be insufficient, the enforcement provisions in Part E ofGEPA apply, including the due process provisions in that part. During thetransition period provided for in section 1491(c) of the Act, a State maycontinue to comply with the requirements under Chapter 1 of the ECIA. The Secretary wishes to emphasize that States have complete discretion,subject to meeting the general criteria set forth in andSection; 200.5(a)(4)(i)-(iii),to use their own procedures instead of the procedures in the two OMB circulars.Moreover, Circular A-102 has recently been revised to permit States toapply their own procedures to LEAs. As a result, even if a State choosesto adopt the procedures of that circular, it would still have considerableflexibility in determining the appropriate standards for accountabilityat the local level. Circular A-87 is currently being revised. In addition, the final regulations make applicable a limited number ofprovisions from Part 76 (State-Administered Programs); Part 77 (DefinitionsThat Apply to Department Regulations); Part 78 (Educational Appeal Board);and Part 81 (General Education Provisions Act_Enforcement). The Secretarybelieves these minimal requirements will help to ensure basic accountabilitywithout imposing undue burden and paperwork on SEAs and LEAs. <T3>Changes: </T3>The criteria that a State's procedures must ``resultin the efficient and effective administration of programs under this part''has been deleted from andSection; 200.5(a)(4). With regard to the commentsregarding clarification of the relationship of certain EDGAR requirementsand Chapter 1 requirements, the Department will provide appropriate clarificationin the policy manual in accordance with section 1436(b)(2) of the Act Section 200.6(c) Other Definitions <T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters recommended revisions to the definitionof ``in loco parentis.'' Specifically, one commenter recommended that theLEA agree to recognize any adult designated as ``in loco parentis.'' Anothercommenter recommended that the SEA be allowed to use the State's legaldefinition of ``in loco parentis.'' Several commenters recommented thatthe definition be revised to require that the parent or legal guardianmake the designation in writing. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The defintion of ``parent'' in section 1471 of theAct includes a person standing in loco parentis. Typically, this personwould be the one with whom the child lives and is often a relative of thechild. In some instances, the parent or legal guardian may wish anotherperson to be responsible for the child's education, including the Chapter1 program. This person must be designated by the parent or legal guardian.However, it is not the intent of the regulations that the designation ofa person ``in loco parentis'' be the Chapter 1 program only with the parentor legal guardian retaining authority with regard to the regular programof instruction in the school. The regualtions do not require that the designationbe in writing. Specific procedures for designating a person to stand inloco parentis are left to the discretion of SEAs and LEAs. <T3>Changes: </T3>The definition of ``parent'' in andSection; 200.6(c) hasbeen revised to clarify that ``in loco parentis'' means either the personwith whom a child lives or, in some instances, another person designedby the parent or legal guardian to be responsible for the total educationalprogram of the child.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three comments were received on the definition of ``educationallydeprived children.'' One commenter questioned whether the definition requiredthe use of standardized, norm-referenced achievement tests to determinewhich children are below the level appropriate for their age. A secondcommenter suggested that the definition be revised to include childrenwho score below the 50th percentile or normal curve equivalence score inreading, language arts, or mathematics. Lastly, one commenter felt thatthere was a lack of congruity between the goal of helping children attaingrade level proficiency and the definition for children retained in grade.The commenter noted that retained children may be able to perform at gradelevel even though their achievement is not appropriate for children theirage. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.31(b) requires that the LEA identify educationallydeprived children in all eligible school attendance areas but does notprovide specific criteria, measures, or procedures to be used. The Secretarybelieves that these decisions should be made by SEAs and LEAs to reflectlocal conditions. As to the perceived conflict between the program purposeand the definition, age has been used to define ``educationally deprivedchildren'' in recognition that for various reasons children may not bein a grade appropriate for their age. Therefore, for the purpose of identifyingeducationally deprived children, age is a more appropriate factor thangrade. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter recommended that the definition of ``preschoolchildren'' be modified to clarify that the children are below the age orgrade the LEA is required to provide free public education, since someschool districts voluntarily provide programs for children before the compulsoryattendance age. <T3>Discussion</T3>: The intent of the definition is to implement section1014(a) of the Act, which provides that among the chidren eligible forservices are those who are not yet at a grade level for which the LEA providesa free public education. This, in an LEA that provides kindergarten forfive-year-olds either voluntarily or because of State law, ``preschoolchildren'' are those children who are not old enough for kindergarten.If the requested modification were made, an LEA might think that it coulduse Chapter 1 funds to provide a ``preschool'' program for some childrenwhile it used local funds to provide the same program for other children,because the LEA was not required to provide the program to any of the children.This use of Chapter 1 funds would violate the supplement, not supplantrequirement in section 1018(b) of the Act. If an LEA is voluntarily providingkindergarten, for example, Chapter 1 funds may be used to provide supplementalservices to eligible children just as at other grades. Classifying thosechildren as ``preschool children'' would not be necessary.<T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: Two comments were received on the definition of ``schoolattendance area.'' One commenter requested clarification of ``voluntarybasis.'' The second commenter believed that a portion of the definition,which refers to a school a child would attend if the child were not attendinga private school or another public school on a voluntary basis, is confusing.<T3>Discussion</T3>: Eligibility of school attendance areas for Chapter1 services is determined on the basis of the number of percentage of low-incomechildren residing in that area. The definition provides a way to countchildren attending private schools, either in the attendance area or outsideit, and also counts children who voluntarily attend another school underan open enrollment policy or a desegregation plan. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters noted that andSection; 200.6(a) refersto the definition of ``more advanced skills'' contained in section 1471of the Act, but that no definition of ``basic skills'' is included. Commenterssuggested that the regulations contain a definition of ``basic skills.''<T3>Discussion</T3>: As commenters noted, the definition of ``more advancedskills'' appears in the statute, but the term ``basic skills'' is not defined.The Secretary believes that, although there is some general agreement thatbasic skills include those skills needed in order to read and compute,States often have varying definitions of the term. The Secretary believesa national definition for Chapter 1, which might conflict with those ofthe States, would cause unnecessary difficulty and is not needed. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. Section 200.20 How Does an LEA Apply for a Subgrant? <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter suggested that andSection; 200.20(a)(5) includea reference to children in adult correctional institutions. <T3>Discussion</T3>: The omission of a reference to children in adult correctionalinstitutions was inadvertent. <T3>Changes</T3>: Sections 200.1 and 200.20 have revised to include childrenin local correctional institutions in addition to those in institutionsfor neglected or delinquent children. <T3>Comment</T3>: Many commenters objected to the requirement in andSection;200.20(a)(8) that the LEA submit to the SEA copies of salary schedulesand policies to ensure compliance with the comparability of services requirementsin andSection; 200.43 of the regulations. Commenters believed that the requirementcreated duplicative, burdensome, and unnecessary paperwork. In addition,commenters noted that salary schedules could become outdated by the timean application for funds was approved. As an alternative, several commentersrecommended that the requirements be revised to require that the LEA maintainon file copies of salary schedules and the policies required by andSection;200.43. <T3>Discussion</T3>: Section 1018(c) of the Act states that, as means ofdemonstrating comparability, an LEA may provide a written assurance thatit has established and implemented a district wide salary schedule; a policyto ensure equivalence among schools in teachers, administrators, and auxiliarypersonnel; and a policy to ensure equivalence among schools in the provisionof curriculum materials and instructional supplies. The intent of the proposedregulations was to provide the SEA with the salary information and policiesfor review prior to approving the application, minimizing the LEA's riskof subsequently being found to be out of compliance with the requirement.However, the Secretary does not want to impose unnecessary paperwork burden,especially since section 1018(c) of the Act states that an LEA shall beconsidered to have met the comparable services requirements if it fileswith the SEA the appropriate written assurance. In any case, the LEA mustcomply with the comparable services requirements in andSection; 200.43, andthe SEA must monitor the LEA's compliance with the requirements. <T3>Changes</T3>: Section 200.20(a) has been revised to remove the provisionrequiring that the LEA include with its application a copy of its salaryschedule and policies. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested the deletion of the provisionrequiring the LEA to submit in its application data showing that the LEAmaintained fiscal effort. The commenters noted that the Act did not specificallyrequire that the data be in an application.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary understands that many SEAs collect andmaintain expenditure data in a form that allows determinations that LEAshave maintained fiscal effort. Therefore, to require LEAs in those Statesto provide that information in an application would be duplicative andunnecessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.20(a)(7) has been revised to require thatdata demonstrating maintenance of fiscal effort be included in the applicationonly if the data are not otherwise available to the SEA.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters took exception to the provision thatallowed the SEA to require LEAs to submit any other information it findsnecessary to ensure compliance with the LEA application assurances in andSection;200.20(a)(10). One commenter suggested that either the assurances or informationdemonstrating compliance should be required, but not both. Another commenterbelieved that this requirement is vague and questioned what informationan SEA would require to determine compliance with the assurances. On theother hand, another commenter requested that the provision be expandedto cover any information the SEA needs to ensure compliance with the requirementsunder this part.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Although the commenters indicated concern over possibleburden an SEA may impose on LEAs by explicitly stating that additionalinformation may be required in an LEA's application, the SEA has responsibilityfor determining that what is proposed in an application meets the requirementsof the Act and the regulations. An SEA may determine that the assurancesin andSection; 200.20(a)(10) are insufficient to determine that LEAs willbe in compliance. However, the Secretary is concerned about the possiblepaperwork burden.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.20(a)(10) has been changed to clarify thatany additional information is to be required with the least possible paperworkand burden.<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested that because andSection; 200.20(a)(4)requires a description of the desired outcomes for children participatingin the Chapter 1 project, in terms of basic and more advanced skills, theterm ``more advanced skills'' should be defined in the definition sectionof the regulations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1471 of the Act includes a definition of theterm ``more advanced skills.'' Section 200.6(a) of the regulations incorporatesinto the regulations definitions of all terms included in section 1471.Therefore, no further definition of the term is necessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two comments were received concerning the requirementin andSection; 200.20(a)(5) that the application include a description ofthe services to be provided to eligible children enrolled in private elementaryand secondary schools. One commenter recommended deletion of the provisionsince section 1012(c) of the Act requires only an assurance that the LEAhas made provisions for services for private school children. Another commentersuggested that the application need only describe services for childrenenrolled in private schools on a districtwide basis and not on a school-by-schoolbasis.Another commenter recommended that the budget required by andSection; 200.20(a)(3)include a listing of the proposed expenditures for private school childrento demonstrate that the LEA plans to make equal expenditures for eligiblechildren enrolled in private schools.Several commenters suggested that additional assurances be required ofan LEA concerning the provision of services to eligible children enrolledin private schools. One commenter recommended that the LEA provide an assurancethat it is implementing requirements for services to private school childrenin andSection;andSection; 200.50 through 200.58. Other commenters requestedan additional assurance that private school officials were consulted, withone commenter suggesting that an appropriate private school official'ssignature be part of the assurance.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Given the statutory requirement to serve eligiblechildren enrolled in private schools and the requirement that the applicationinclude a description of projects to be conducted, the Secretary believesthat, in addition to an assurance that private school children will beserved, a description is needed in order for the SEA to approve the application.The description need only describe services to be provided for all eligibleattendance areas selected for participation in the program and not separatelyfor each attendance area, and should provide sufficient information forthe SEA to determine that the services ensure equitable participation inaccordance with andSection;andSection; 200.50 through 200.58.Section 200.20(a)(3) of the proposed regulations required that the projectdescription include a budget for the initial project year. As part of thatbudget, the Secretary agrees that the budget should be of sufficient detailto show proposed expenditures for both public and private school children.<T3>Changes: </T3>Paragraphs (a)(3) and (d)(3) of andSection; 200.20 havebeen revised to clarify that the budget include proposed expenditures forservices to both public and private school children. In addition, andSection;200.20(a)(5) has been changed to require that the description of servicesfor eligible children enrolled in private schools be provided to ensurethe equitable participation of the children in accordance with andSection;andSection;200.50 through 200.58.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the assurance in andSection;200.20(a)(10)(ii) of the proposed regulations be revised to include pupilservices personnel in the group to be consulted concerning the design andimplementation of the project.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that pupil services personnel,with their knowledge and skills concerning parents, families, and supportservices, can play an important role in designing and implementing projects.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.20(a)(10)(i)(B) has been changed to includepupil services personnel in the assurance concerning consultation.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that andSection; 200.20(a)(10)(iv)of the proposed regulations, which refers to coordinating the Chapter 1curriculum with the regular instructional program, provide for an examinationof the regular program of instruction to determine whether practices relatedto that instruction were contributing to Chapter 1 children's lack of achievement.The commenter made a similar request for andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(iv)(D)of the proposed regulations, which refers to improving coordination withthe regular school program.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The proposed regulations concerning coordination ofthe instruction provided with funds under this part with the regular instructionalprogram stem directly from sections 1012(c) and 1021(b)(1)(A)(ii) of theAct. Given that one of the purposes of the assistance under this part isto help educationally deprived children succeed in the regular program,coordination between the instructional programs would seem to be essential.The Secretary agrees that the required coordination of services includesan examination of practices and procedures under both the Chapter 1 programand the regular program. To examine one and not the other precludes anygenuine efforts to coordinate services.Section 200.1(b) of the regulations reflects the statutory purpose of theprogram_helping participating children succeed in the regular program.Both statutory requirements for coordinating the services are includedin the regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.20(a)(10) and 200.27(a)(2) have not beenrevised, but andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(ii) has been added to the regulations,which requires an LEA to include in its evaluation a review of Chapter1 children's progress in the regular program.Section 200.23 How Does an SEA Allocate County Aggregate Amounts?<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters recommended that the regulations include alternativemethods of identifying low-income students such as school lunch and Aidto Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Also recommended was languagerequiring SEAs to allocate funds to LEAs in the county on the basis ofa uniform measure of poverty.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.23(b)(1) of the regulations requires thatthe SEA allocate the county aggregate amount to LEAs in the county on thebest available data on the number of children from low-income familiesin the LEAs. No specific method is identified in the regulations so itshould be understood that a variety of methods may be used. The Secretaryagrees that, in accordance with section 1005(a)(2) of the Act, the allocationamong LEAs must be on an equitable basis; therefore, a uniform measureof low-income must be used for all LEAs in the county.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.23(b)(1) has been modified to require thatthe SEA shall use a uniform measure of low-income in the county.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that when an LEA serves childrenfrom another LEA, the SEA should not adjust the LEA's allocation and thatthe two LEAs should devise a plan together to provide services to the students.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.23(b)(2)(iii) suggests that an SEA mayadjust allocations or permit the LEA individually or in cooperation withanother LEA to carry out the project. There is no requirement that theSEA must adjust an allocation in such a circumstance.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned if the State could require theLEA to spend additional funds or provide additional services to the neglectedor delinquent institutions if the State finds that services being providedare insufficient.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If the LEA receives an allocation for children ina local institution, the LEA must include the children residing in theinstitution in its annual needs assessment. Resources are allocated toschools on the basis of the number and needs of children to be served,including children in the local institution. The LEA must address the needsof the children in the institution. Some of the children may be servedin public schools by the Chapter 1 LEA Program while others may be servedin the institution. Decisions on the resources made available are madeby the LEA on the basis of its annual needs assessment. The SEA has theresponsibility for approving applications and monitoring the LEA's compliancewith requirements.Therefore, in certain situations, the SEA could require an LEA to provideadditional resources for children in institutions.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification on whether theSEA should adjust an LEA's allocation on a prorated basis if a neglectedor delinquent institution closes.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If a neglected or delinquent institution were to closebefore the beginning of the school year, the funds would be transferredto the LEA in which the institution to which the students would be transferredis located. If the institution were to close in the middle of the schoolyear, the LEA would have met its obligation for serving those studentsand there is no statutory requirement to adjust its allocation.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the minimum allocation (fewerthan 10 children) language in andSection; 200.23(b)(3) apply to this sectionin regard to services to children attending neglected or delinquent institutionsand private schools.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The language in section 1005(b) of the Act refersto the total number of children to be counted for purposes of allocationof funds and not to numbers of children eligible to be served. In determiningthe number of children for purposes of allocations, children who attendprivate schools or are in neglected or delinquent institutions are counted.The ``fewer than 10 children'' language applies only when the entire LEAhas fewer than 10 children to generate funds.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 200.25 How Does an SEA Allocate Concentration Grants to an LEA?<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters recommended the retention of a unified allocationto counties of basic and concentration grants but also recommended thatthe regulations specify that SEAs need not issue differing regulationsto govern the two types of grants.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Although not stated in the proposed regulations, thisis the Secretary's intent.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.25(c) has been added to clarify that regulationsgoverning basic grant funds also apply to concentration grant funds.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that regulations be developedfor those districts that are located in more than one county.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The same principles included in andSection; 200.23(b)(2)(i)in regard to the basic grant allocation for districts that overlap countylines apply to concentration grants.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether each LEA would receiveconcentration grant funds if every LEA in the State meets the eligibilityrequirements.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If an LEA meets the eligibility requirements as definedin andSection; 200.3(c)(1), it will receive concentration grant funds. Therefore,if every LEA meets the eligibility requirements, each would receive anappropriate proportion of concentration grant funds from the SEA.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned if an LEA composed of twelvetown school districts would be required to demonstrate how funds are spenttown by town or for the LEA as a whole.<T3>Discussion: </T3>As with basic grant funds, the LEA is not requiredto account for expenditure of its concentration grant funds among subunits.Neither will the LEA be required to account separately for basic and concentrationgrant funds.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned what to do if a school doesnot want a concentration grant.<T3>Discussion: </T3>An LEA, not a school, is eligible for concentrationfunds. Therefore, the school does not have the option to decline a concentrationgrant.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters requested that ``eligible LEA'' be clarifiedto mean ``eligible LEA for concentration grant.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees this clarification would be helpful.<T3>Changes: </T3>Throughout andSection; 200.25, the term ``eligible LEAs''has been revised to clarify that the LEA is eligible for concentrationgrant funds.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that all funds be distributedby the SEA to eligible LEAs in proportion to the number of children fromlow-income families in the school district.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1006 of the Act requires distribution of concentrationgrants to those LEAs that meet the eligibility criteria.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned if it would be possible to rankorder those eligible LEAs that are in ineligible counties applying forconcentration grants or if all that apply must receive funds.<T3>Discussion: </T3>For those LEAs that are located in ineligible counties,the SEA may reserve not more than 2 percent of concentration grant fundsto make direct payments to those LEAs. SEAs must rank order those LEAsto determine concentration grant payments. Since determinations of povertyin LEAs by States are often based on criteria other than those used todetermine eligilitity of counties, there may be some States in which thereare several LEAs eligible, based on criteria States use, that are not locatedin counties that receive allocations. The ranking procedure will allowSEAs to allocate funds to those LEAs in greatest need.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.25(b)(1) has been revised to clarify thatLEAs in ineligible counties will be rank ordered to receive concentrationgrants from the 2 percent portion of the total concentration grant amountthe SEA may reserve for those LEAs.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned that the mixing of two datasources to allocate basic and concentration grants would be cumbersomeand could result in some inequities.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that concentration grants areto be allocated on the basis of the same data sources as are basic grantsas described in andSection;200.23 or andSection;200.24 of the regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.25 has been modified throughout to referto the current number of children counted for the purposes of andSection;200.23or andSection;200.24. Section 200.23 has been revised to state that the SEAshall use a uniform measure of poverty to determine the number of childrenfrom low-income families.<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters recommended that the regulations be changedto clarify that the term ``proportion of low-income families'' refers tochildren counted under either the 15 percent or the 6,500 criteria, notjust the 15 percent.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary concurs that the clarification wouldbe helpful.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.25 has been revised accordingly.Section 200.26 How Does an SEA Reallocate Funds?<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters stated that there is a conflict betweenthe maintenance of effort and reallocation requirements. One section indicatesthat SEAs are to reallocate funds if an LEA fails to maintain effort andthe other that SEAs are to proportionally reduce the allocation. One ofthe commenters suggested that present policy regarding failure to meetmaintenance of effort requirements is better.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the proposed wording ofandSection;200.26(a)(ii) was not clear and appeared to say that an LEA thatfailed to maintain effort would not have already had its allocation reduced.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.26(a)(ii) has been revised accordingly.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that giving comparable data todemonstrate an increase in low-income children since 1980 is impossiblefor States that retain data on free milk, and free lunch, and AFDC foronly five years as required by law and not nine years as would be requiredby this interpretation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1403(b) of Act requires that funds be reallocatedonly to those LEAs where distribution of funds under the formula in section1005 has resulted in inequity ``as a result of such factors as populationshifts or changing economic circumstances.'' Unless the data on which theoriginal distribution was made have been retained, a determination of theseshifts and changes cannot be made.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested clarification on censusundercounts or overcounts. One asked if a documented census undercountwould be considered an inequity in the application formula. The othersrequested additional language to cover estimated overcounts or undercountsof individuals from the most recent decennial census.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The issue of census undercounts and overcounts willbe discussed in the policy manual. In reference to the question regardingan inequity in the formula, section 1005(c)(2)(a) of the Act requires thatthe count of children be based ``on the most recent satisfactory data availablefrom the Department of Commerce,'' whereas section 1403(a)(2) refers tofactors such as population shifts and changing economic circumstances.Therefore, the Secretary does not think alleged undercounts form a basisfor reallocation.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether the comparison with1980 data also holds for the neglected and delinquent caseload data, orif it can be determined on a current basis.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.26(b)(2)(ii) discussed one of the factorsthat may cause inequities in the formula which is ``caseload data usedin the allocation that are not representative of the number of neglectedor delinquent children in local institutions.'' However, caseload dataare collected annually, not based on 1980 data. If the State determinesthat the caseload data used for initial allocation were not accurate, thatinaccuracy is a basis for reallocating funds to the LEA.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 200.30 How Does an LEA Select School Attendance Areas to be ProjectAreas?<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter supported the option to continue to serveschools one year beyond the year at which they cease to be selected forparticipation, but the commenter recommended it be stipulated that schoolsserved under this provisions not replace schools selected to operate aChapter 1 project.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Although consensus was reached by the negotiated rulemakinggroups on project areas, the group did not consider whether schools identifiedas eligible under any of the special rules in andSection;200.30(b) couldreplace schools determined to be eligible under the general rule in andSection;200.30(a).It is not the intent of andSection;200.30(b)(5) to deny Chapter 1 servicesto any eligible school but to provide continued services for one additionalyear to a school that was eligible and served the previous year but, inthe absence of this provision, would not be selected to participate inthe Chapter 1 project. However, if an LEA does not have sufficient fundsto add services to a school that is now eligible and could be served, butreceived no services the previous year, the LEA may choose to continueservices in the formerly served school this year and not serve the schoolthat would otherwise participate.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.30(b)(5) has been revised to provide thata school attendance area that continues to be served under the continuationprovisions may take the place of an otherwise eligible school attendancearea that could be served.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that LEAs be allowed to selecteligible attendance areas by using a combination of percentage and averagenumber of children from low-income families.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The use of a combination of percentage and numberof children from low-income families has been an acceptable procedure foridentifying eligible attendance areas under Chapter 1 (ECIA). To meet therequirement for targeting resources on a limited number of school attendanceareas with the highest concentration of children from low-income families,the procedure limited the number of eligible attendance areas to the numberit would have identified if it had used only one of the methods.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.30(a)(2)(B)(ii) has been added to allow anLEA to use a combination of percentage and number of children from low-incomefamilies in identifying eligible areas, except that the total number ofeligible attendance areas may not exceed the number of attendance areasthe LEA would have identified as eligible if it had used only one of themethods.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the exemption in andSection;200.30(d) be expanded to include an LEA with not more than one school buildingfor each grade span in order to prevent unnecessary paperwork for qualifyingLEAs.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If an LEA has only one school building for each gradespan, that school is automatically eligible for Chapter 1 services.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.30(d)(2) is added specifically to exemptan LEA from identifying eligible attendance areas if the LEA has no morethan one school attendance area at each grade span.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned that the language used indiscussion of concentration of services is too lax and requested strongerand more clarifying language to ensure that schools provide services inthe area identified as most in need.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of andSection; 200.30 requireLEAs to rank schools on the basis of concentrations of low-income childrenand select schools on the basis of that ordering. Section 200.32 requiresLEAs to establish projects of sufficient size, scope, and quality to givereasonable promise of substantial progress toward meeting the needs ofeducationally deprived children. Section 200.33(a) requires LEAs to allocatefunds among schools on the basis of the number and needs of children ineach school. The Secretary believes that, taken together, the provisionsprovide for sufficient concentration of services commensurate with statutoryrequirements.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested clarification to allow anLEA to waive a needs assessment requirement at certain grade levels ifit determines that funding is inadequate to provide services in all gradelevels.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1014(b) of the Act provides that an LEA mayreceive Chapter 1 funds only if it makes an assessment of educational needseach year to identify educationally deprived children in all eligible attendanceareas. An assessment of educational needs must be made at all grade levelsto determine the areas and grade levels of greatest need. The regulationsaccurately reflect the legislative requirement that an assessment of educationalneeds be made each year in all eligible attendance areas.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the special rule in andSection;200.30(b)(1) should clarify the 5 percent above or below the average concentrationof low-income children and if all schools must be served when an LEA implementsthis provision. Others recommended that the regulations be changed to allowthe LEA to use this provision if the school with the highest concentrationof low-income children was within ten percentage points of the school withthe lowest concentration of these children in a grade grouping or the entireLEA. Another commenter requested that the no-wide-variance rule now establishedbe applied only to the variation below the LEA average concentration ofthese children because attendance areas above the average are already eligible.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The House Report and Senate Report, which providethe legislative history for Pub. L. 100-297, make Congressional intentclear that in order for LEAs to apply the no-wide-variance provision, thevariation from the districtwide poverty average is no more than five percent.This provision provides additional specificity to the previous Chapter1 provision allowing LEAs to serve all their school attendance areas ifthey have uniformly high concentrations of poverty.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.30(b)(1) has been changed to make it clearthat in order to apply this provision, the percentage of children fromlow-income families in each school attendance area is not more than fivepercentage points above or five percentage points below the average percentageof children from all low-income families within a grade span grouping orwithin the entire LEA.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested a clarification of the interchangeableuse of the terms ``attendance area'' and ``building,'' and the term ``project.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>``Project'' is defined in 34 CFR 77.1 to mean theactivity described in an application. ``School attendance area'' means,in relation to a particular public school, the geographic area in whichthe children who are normally served by that school reside. The Secretaryagrees that the use of the term ``building'' was inconsistent with otherterminology in the regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>The term ``building'' in andSection; 200.43(b) has beenchanged to ``attendance area'' to be more consistent with other terminologyand to clarify the regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters claimed that implementation of andSection;200.30(b)(2)(ii) would require excessive recordkeeping to implement the25 percent rule and is too restrictive in the use of funds for students.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The purpose of andSection; 200.30(b)(2)(ii) is to ensurethat funds under this part are targeted to areas with high concentrationsof children from low-income families and that services for children alreadybeing served are not diminished in order to serve more schools under the25 percent rule. This reflects the statutory requirement in section 1013(b)(2)of the Act.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested that andSection; 200.30(a)(3)clarify whether LEAs are required to have the same Chapter 1 program activityin all attendance areas or if the program activities could be differentin some areas. The commenters stated that there appeared to be a conflictbetween this section and andSection; 200.31.<T3>Discussion: </T3>This provision is not in conflict with, but supports,andSection; 200.31 of these regulations. The emphasis of Chapter 1 is toconcentrate or target funds to the areas and students who have the greatesteducational needs. Studies show that the children with greatest educationalneeds are those who reside in areas with high concentrations of low-incomechildren. Consequently, the statute requires that LEAs annually rank theeligible attendance areas by relative degrees of concentrations of thesechildren. The regulations reflect the intent of the legislation to concentratefunds on those children most in need of special educational services. Further,andSection; 200.33(a) of the regulations, requiring LEAs to allocate fundsto schools based on both the number and needs of children in the schools,and the school program improvement requirements for andSection;andSection;200.37 and 200.38, indicates that LEAs are not required to provide thesame activities in all attendance areas.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter interpreted the ranking of attendance areaprovision to mean that the decision as to which schools will be servedcan be made immediately after the district ranks the attendance areas.<T3>Discussion: </T3>In addition to ranking, LEAs must determine what levelof services will be provided to the schools, and the cost of those services.They would then select attendance areas, in rank order, until all availablefunds are exhausted.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether the comparison of theproportion of children from low-income families in andSection; 200.30(b)(3)(i)to designate a school that serves an ineligible attendance area as an eligibleschool was with one eligible school or with the average of all eligibleschools.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.30(b)(3)(i) accurately states the intentof the Act. The LEA may compare the proportion of low-income children inany eligible attendance area.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters recommended that school attendance areasbe defined or expanded to allow the pairing or grouping of school buildingshaving no overlapping grades. Commenters felt that unless this is donethere will be a negative impact on Chapter 1 projects and comparabilityrequirements.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The term ``school attendance area'' is defined inandSection; 200.6(c). The Department will address specific applications ofthese regulations by providing examples in the policy manual to apply tospecific practices in LEAs with paired schools or in LEAs that use groupingsof schools for attendance area selection and comparability.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed a concern that the regulationsdo not exclude local institutions for neglected or delinquent childrenfrom the school attendance area ranking required by andSection; 200.30(a)of the regulations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>If the SEA determines that a local institution meetseither the definition as an institution for delinquent children or an institutionfor neglected children as defined in andSection; 200.6(c) of the regulations,children residing in the institution are eligible for services under thispart regardless of where the children attend school. The institution neednot demonstrate eligibility for services on the basis of the number ofpercentage of children from low-income families and, therefore, the institutionis not included in the ranking of eligible attendance areas.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 200.31 How Does an LEA Identify and Select Children to Participate?<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters supported the special rule allowingthe selection of limited English proficient children for Chapter 1 serviceson a basis other than English language deficiency by using various selectionprocedures. One commenter recommended that the regulations be identicalto the statute regarding selection of limited English proficient studentsand that the description of alternative methods be deleted. The commenterbelieved that the regulations, specifically the alternative selection proceduresin andSection; 200.31(c)(5)(ii), provided a dual selection process_one foreducationally deprived children and one for limited English proficientchildren. Still other commenters requested that the provision coveringthe selection of limited English proficient students for Chapter 1 be deletedand stated that the remaining student selection regulations are adequate,and that the LEAs are in the best position to distinguish between educationaldeprivation and language factors. Other commenters requested that languagedominance tests be deleted or noted that the use of language dominancetests alone would result in selection of children solely on the basis oflanguage difference, and not on the basis of educational deprivation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The negotiated rulemaking group agreed with the studentselection requirements in andSection; 200.31, including the clarificationof the requirements for identifying and selecting children with limitedEnglish proficiency. In addition, the Conference Report that provides partof the history for determining Congressional intent in Pub. L. 100-297states that LEAs may use current Chapter 1 assessment procedures for childrenwho, with or without bilingual assistance in the testing process, can beidentified, using tests written in the English language, as educationallydeprived children in greatest need of assistance. For children whose lackof English language proficiency precludes valid assessment using testswritten in the English language, local procedures to screen and selecteducationally deprived limited English proficient children may be used,e.g., teacher evaluation, language dominance testing, weighting factors,or others indicators of educational deprivation that discriminate on abasis other that just language deficiency. However, the Secretary agreeswith the comment that language dominance tests that are used alone wouldresult in the selection of students solely on the basis of language difference.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.31(c)(5)(ii) of the regulations has beenmodified to require that language dominance tests be used only in combinationwith other measures to select children for Chapter 1.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that Chapter 1 services shouldnot be altered to meet a student's limited English proficiency or addressa handicapping condition. Yet another commenter was concerned that thedifficulty of discerning between learning disabilities, mild retardation,and limited English proficiency will cause classroom teachers not to recommendstudents for special education evaluation if they know Chapter 1 will selectthese students.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes further regulation on thismatter would restrict the LEA's options to assess the needs of studentsand to plan programs that best meet their educational needs. Local officialsmust use their best professional judgments in placement of children ineducational programs. In designing Chapter 1 services, some individualdifferences may need to be addressed for children with handicapping conditionsor lack of English language proficiency on the same basis that individualdifferences require alternative approaches with other Chapter 1 participants.LEAs must have discretionary authority in planning Chapter 1 activitiesthat best meet the needs of educationally disadvantaged children and tocoordinate Chapter 1 activities with services to children with handicappingconditions and limited English proficiency.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested adding a provision that wouldnot require that an LEA provide services to handicapped or limited Englishproficient children if it determines that two services would fragment thestudents' basic classroom program, or if other students are waiting andhave no services to meet their basic and advanced skills needs.<T3>Discussion: </T3>An LEA must consider alternative approaches to educatingchildren and provide the best education program that is possible regardlessof the child's educational levels or needs. Fragmented programs resultin poorer student achievement and inefficient use of student and instructionaltime. Section 1012(e)(4) of the Act requires an LEA to assure that, inthe case of participating students who are also limited English proficientor are handicapped, it will provide maximum coordination between servicesprovided by Chapter 1 and services provided to address children's handicappingconditions or limited English proficiency, in order to increase effectiveness,eliminate duplication, and reduce fragmentation of the students' programs.Section 200.20(a)(1)(v) requires LEAs to provide maximum coordination betweenChapter 1 services and services provided to address children's handicappingconditions or limited English proficiency.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification to ensure thatin identifying and selecting students with limited English proficiencyas eligible educationally deprived children, LEAs use valid assessmentmeasurements. The commenter was concerned that, in addition to tests writtenin English, other assessment procedures, also dependent on English proficiency,would yield invalid assessments of educational achievement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The intent of andSection; 200.31(b)(6)(ii)(B) of theproposed regulations was to provide LEAs with alternatives for identifyingand selecting children with limited English proficiency for services. TheSecretary shares the commenter's concern that assessment procedures, includingtests, produce valid results to ensure that children with limited Englishproficiency are properly identified and selected for participation in theChapter 1 LEA Program.<T3>Changes: </T3>The term ``test'' in andSection; 200.31(b)(6)(ii)(B) hasbeen changed to ``valid assessment.''<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned how a teacher who does not speaka child's language can select a child who does not speak English otherthan on the basis of English language deficiency. Another commenter wasconcerned that some educators may lack the expertise to determine whichneeds stem from a child's handicapping condition and which needs stem froma child being educationally disadvantaged.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department is currently preparing additional guidanceon this topic, which will be included in the Chapter 1 policy manual. Inaddition, State and local agencies may ask the Technical Assistance Centers(TACs) for assistance on this matter.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned what the needs assessment shouldcover in order to identify participants' need for library resources. Anothercommenter questioned how library resource needs for Chapter 1 are limitedto avoid duplication of a school's general need for library resources andwhy library resources are not already included under special educationalneeds. Another commenter suggested deletion of the library resource needsin the regulation to avoid instances of supplanting.<T3>Discussion: </T3>An LEA may determine the personnel, materials, andlibrary resources necessary to meet the special educational needs of participatingchildren. If these resources are not available in the regular school tomeet the needs of the Chapter 1 children, then Chapter 1 funds may be usedto supplement those resources.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.3(b)(6) has been changed to clarify thatin addition to determining the special educational needs of participatingchildren, the LEA must determine the personnel, instructional materials,and library resources necessary to meet the special educational needs ofthe participating children.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that andSection; 200.31 shouldredefine the term ``educationally deprived'' so that the specificity ofthe statement allows for equal identification and selection of studentsin elementary and secondary schools and graded and nongraded situations.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The definition of educationally deprived childrencontained in andSection; 200.6 is the same as that used under Chapter 1,ECIA and Title I, ESEA. The definition was a topic of discussion at regionalmeetings conducted by the Department to solicit input on the regulationsand during the negotiated rulemaking demonstration that followed the meetings.There was general agreement, with which the Secretary concurs, that thedefinition should continue to be the same as it was in the predecessorprograms. The Secretary believes the definition provides the necessaryguidance and flexibility for LEAs to select elementary and secondary schoolstudents in both graded and nongraded schools.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters requested clarification of the specialrule in andSection; 200.31(c)(3) that allows LEAs to serve students for anadditional two years. One commenter questioned whether a district couldserve students who previously had the greatest need over those who arenow in the greatest need.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Some students who have received Chapter 1 servicesand who continue to be educationally deprived but are no longer in greatestneed for special assistance need some extra reinforcement or support toensure that they maintain their gains. The LEA may serve these childrenbefore serving those presently in greatest need. The determination to implementthe provision is up to local school officials.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concerns over the use ofobjective and subjective information in the needs assessment process. Commentersquestioned how objective criteria differed from assessment criteria; suggestedthat subjective data such as teacher assessment should be permissible forselection of students; expressed opposition to the use of teacher evaluationof student's performance for student selection, requested clarificationon the meaning of ``establish educationally related objective criteria;''suggested that criteria should be applied uniformly at all grade levelsserving a particular curriculum area so there is consistency in servingstudents in greatest need; and proposed modifying andSection; 200.31(b)(4)to read: ``uniformly apply the criteria required in paragraph (b)(3) ofthis section to particular grade levels having a specific component asidentified in the needs assessment.''<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary is aware that selection of studentsto participate in the Chapter 1 program may involve a combination of severalfactors, and believes LEAs are best situated to determine which factorsbest fit the local situation. Further, the Secretary concurs that in orderto identify those students in greatest need of special educational assistanceand to select the areas of service and the grade levels to be served, theLEA must uniformly apply the same objective measurements appropriate forthe grade levels throughout all the eligible areas. The selection of instrumentsand the amount of teacher-based information that an LEA uses in the conductof the assessment is a local determination. This matter will be addressedin more detail in the policy manual.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether, when an LEA establisheseducationally related criteria, which include written or oral testing instruments,the LEA can be required to verify that all those standards identified arebelow the 50th percentile on a nationally normed achievement test.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Educationally deprived children are those whose educationalattainment is below the level that is appropriate for children of theirage. If there are locally or State-developed measurement instruments thathave local or State norms, those norms may be used to identify the educationallydeprived children. There is no requirement to verify selection instrumentswith a nationally normed achievement test.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommend that LEAs be allowed to use Chapter1 funds to conduct the annual assessment of educational needs. The commentersupported this position by stating that, after the first year of Chapter1, LEAs have been pressured by Congressional mandates to operate a continuousfederally supported program for educationally deprived students and thatit is illegal for an LEA to use public tax revenues to assess educationalneeds of nonpublic students. Another commenter questioned whether the generalprovision in andSection; 200.31(a) precludes the LEA from using Chapter 1funds to conduct the annual assessment of educational needs provision inandSection; 200.31(b).<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1011(a)(1) of the Act provides that Chapter1 funds may be used only for programs and projects that are designed tomeet the special educational needs of identified educationally deprivedchildren. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the LEA to identify_throughmeasures already available to it_the educationally deprived children ineligible areas. The LEA may acquire from nonpublic school officials comparableinformation that may be used to determine which nonpublic school childrenare eligible for Chapter 1. Once eligibility has been established, furtherassessment to determine specific needs of children may be supported withChapter 1 funds.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned if, when following a studentwho has transferred to a school attendance area or a school not receivingfunds under this part, the funding for service at the new school shouldbe taken from funds allotted to the student's original school. Alternatively,the commenter suggested the LEA retain funds prior to allocating moniesto each site to provide this service.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.31(c)(1) permits an LEA to continue toprovide services to children who transfer to a school not receiving services.The decision is left to the LEA and must be based on available resourcesand concerns about the size, scope, and quality of the services. Sincethe services can be provided only during the current school year, ratherthan allotting funds, the LEA will have to redirect staff and instructionalmaterials and supplies. The specific procedures are best determined bythe LEA.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter interpreted the requirement to assess theneeds of children in all eligible attendance areas to mean only those schoolsthe district intends to serve rather than a requirement to conduct a needsassessment in all eligible schools.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1014(b) of the Act requires an LEA to makean assessment of needs in all eligible attendance areas.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested that andSection;andSection;200.30(a) and 200.31(b) appear to suggest that a project may be carriedout in a lower-ranked school only if that same project has been implementedin a higher-ranked school and that an LEA must implement the same activityat the same grade level throughout the school district. Two commentersrecommended that the needs assessment should dictate the project implementedat any school. Two other commenters requested clarification as to whetherthey had to have the same program activity in all attendance areas or couldthey have different program areas.<T3>Discussion:</T3> In setting out the requirements for project area andstudent selection in andSection;andSection; 200.30(a) and 200.31(b), the Secretarydid not mean to suggest that the Chapter 1 project must be the same inall locations.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.31(b)(2) has been revised to clarify thatinstructional areas and grade levels to be served may vary among and withinschool attendance areas if the needs assessment data support differingareas and grades.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that, because of the importantrole pupil services can play in meeting the special needs of participants,andSection; 200.31(b)(6) should be revised to include the need for pupilservices.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary believes that it is not necessary tospecify pupil services in this section of the regulations, since inclusionof pupil services is included elsewhere. However, the Secretary does wishto make it clear that available personnel and other resources_includingpupil services_must be considered in determining how the LEA will meetthe special educational needs of the children.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.31(b)(6)(ii) has been added to clarify thatthe LEA must determine the resources it will use to meet the special educationalneeds of participating children.Section 200.32 What Are the Size, Scope, and Quality Requirements of aProject?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that the size, scope, and qualityprovision specifically state that the determination should be made by theLEA. Alternatively, the commenter suggested the requirement be deletedor that the regulations define the terms: ``size, scope, and quality;''``give reasonable promise;'' and ``substantial progress toward meetingeducation needs.''<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1012(b) of the Act requires that an LEA'sapplication provide an assurance that the program and projects are of sufficientsize, scope, and quality and gives the SEA approval authority for the LEA'sapplication. In exercising its approval authority, the SEA reviews theconformity of the LEA's application to the size, scope, and quality requirementsin andSection; 200.32. Interpretations of ``reasonable promise'' and ``substantialprogress'' are more appropriately made by an SEA in light of the specificconditions in the State and the LEA.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.33 How Does an LEA Allocate Resources to Project Areas andSchools?<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters requested clarification for the term ``degreeof educational deprivation'' as used in andSection; 200.33(a)(2) of the regulations.<T3>Discussion:</T3> In requiring LEAs to take into account the degreeof educational deprivation of students when allocating Chapter 1 resourcesto schools, the Secretary recognizes that it takes more resources to bringchildren far behind their peers up to an educational level that is expectedfor their age than may be needed for children who are closer to the norm.The Secretary leaves to LEAs the flexibility on how this general principleshould be applied.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that the regulations providesafeguards to ensure the greatest weight be given to children receivingservices for the first time.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary does not believe there is evidence thata student entering the program for the first time is needier than studentsalready in the program. Section 200.33(a)(1) requires LEAs to considerthe needs of children in allocating resources to schools. If an LEA findsthat first-time entrance into Chapter 1 is a factor influencing the relativeneed of the student, it may include that factor in its decision on allocationof resources.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed concern that it will requirean undue amount of paperwork and documentation to support the allocationof the resources, and that funds within the local system should flow basedon a well-planned assessment of student needs.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.33 makes clear that resource allocationand needs assessment are highly related. That indeed is the purpose ofthis provision. The Secretary does not intend, nor does he believe, thatthe process will be burdensome.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that ``allocate resources'' besubstituted for ``allocated funds'' because services may be in time, number,or ratio.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees with the suggestion.<T3>Changes:</T3> The language of andSection; 200.33 has been revised toreflect this suggestion.Section 200.34 How Does an LEA Involve Parents?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that the planning, design,and implementation of the Chapter 1 program be left to professionally trainededucators.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Subsections (b) and (c) of section 1012 of the Actdesignate the LEA as the agency authorized to apply for funds in an applicationdeveloped in consultation with teachers and parents. The programs and projectsdescribed in the application are to be designed and implemented in consultationwith teachers (including early childhood education professionals and librarianswhen appropriate), and provide for parental involvement in accordance withsection 1016 of the Act, which includes, but is not limited to, parentinput into the design and implementation of the Chapter 1 program.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters expressed concern that the parent involvementactivities listed in the proposed regulations were excessive and wouldtake needed resources from direct student services. One suggested thatthe regulations follow the legislation and list recommended activities.Another felt that these provisions gave excessive power to parents.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1016(c)(1) of the Act requires LEAs to providereasonable support for parental involvement activities as parents may request.The determination of the amount of funds to be used for this purpose isan LEA responsibility in consultation with parents. The regulations reiteratethe activities contained in the statute. While parents are to be consulted,the LEA retains legal authority for all aspects of the Chapter programand must carry out the program in accordance with all statutory and regulatoryrequirements.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that a minimum number be stipulatedfor the term ``regular'' in defining the frequency of meetings of parentsto formulate program input.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The term ``regular'' is used in the statute. EachLEA is to determine the frequency in consideration of the desires of parentsof participating children.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter inquired as to the means the annual assessmentof effectiveness of parental involvement will be accomplished.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021 of the Act requires each LEA to conductthe annual assessment in consultation with parents. The design and implementationof the assessment, therefore, is the responsibility of the LEA in consultationwith parents.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended including a Parent Chapter1 Evaluation Council elected by parents and teachers.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The statute contains no authority on which the Secretarycould rely to require the information of parent Chapter 1 evaluation councils.LEAs may, in consultation with parents, establish parent advisory councilsand determine the manner in which membership is to be selected.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that there were insufficientdetails in the regulations to ensure that parental involvement is effective.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(a)(4) of the Act and andSection; 200.34(d)of the regulations require each LEA to assess annually, through consultationwith parents, the effectiveness of parental involvement and to determineactions, if any, needed to increase parental participation. The Secretarybelieves these assessment requirements and the specific requirements inandSection; 200.34(c) are sufficient to ensure effective parental involvement.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that training be allowed inconversational usage in languages other than English for teachers and otherstaff working with limited English proficient students as well as trainingin English conversational usage for non-English speaking parents.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1016 of the Act and andSection; 200.34 of theregulations require the LEA to support training of parents to understandthe program, to work with the children, and to ensure opportunities, tothe extent practicable, for the full participation of parents whose nativelanguage is not English. To accomplish the latter, an LEA may need to provideparents with training in conversational English. Also, to the extent practicable,information, programs, and activities for parents are to be provided ina language and form that parents understand, which may necessitate trainingof teachers and staff to be able to communicate in the native language(s)of the parents.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended adding principals to thoseto be trained.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The statute intends that the LEA is to provide trainingto all school staff who are involved in the Chapter 1 program, includingprincipals, to work with parents and build a home-school partnership. TheSecretary agrees that the school principal is an important member of theschool staff and should be included in the list of those to be trained.<T3>Changes: </T3>Paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of andSection; 200.34 have beenmodified to add ``principals'' to parents and other staff members to betrained.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended adding pupil services personnel,specifically social workers, to this section.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The statute intends that any education personnel underthe Chapter 1 program are to be included among those accessible to parentsand that such personnel may receive training and support to work with parents.The Secretary believes that pupil services personnel, including schoolsocial workers, are among such education personnel.<T3>Changes: </T3>Paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (e)(6) of andSection; 200.34have been modified to add ``pupil services personnel.''<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters questioned whether reasonable amountsof Chapter 1 funds could be spent for refreshments and food provided duringparent meetings or training sessions.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1016(c)(5) of the Act states that LEAs mayincur reasonable and necessary expenditures associated with attendanceof parents at training sessions. Reasonable expenditure for refreshmentsor food, particularly when such sessions extend through mealtime, are allowable.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if parents can be paid to attendmeetings.<T3>Discussion: </T3>While the statute authorizes LEAs to incur reasonableand necessary expenditures associated with parental involvement, theseexpenditures are limited to costs that are related to any expenses theparent may incur to participate, including babysitting and transportation.The LEA is not authorized to pay a parent to attend a meeting or trainingsession or to reimburse a parent for salary lost because the parent misseswork to attend meetings, training sessions, or any other Chapter 1 relatedactivity.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters recommended that the regulations clarifythat parents are to be involved in the entire Chapter 1 LEA Program, notonly the parent involvement section. One commenter further recommendedthat the general rule in andSection; 200.34(a)(i) include parent input intothe evaluation of Chapter 1 projects, and rather than refer to ``thoseprograms,'' the regulations specify that the input is for the ``Chapter1 LEA Program.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.34(a), reiterating the provision in section1016(a)(3) of the Act, states that parent involvement include, but notbe limited to, input into planning, design, and implementation of Chapter1 projects. The statutory and regulatory language is broad enough to includeevaluation activities. The Secretary does not think that added specificityin the regulation is needed. The Secretary agrees, however, with the suggestionthe regulations emphasize that the parental involvement is for the Chapter1 LEA Program.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.34(a)(i) has been modified to clarify thatparents are to be involved in the Chapter 1 LEA Program.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification of what kind ofcoordination is intended with programs under the Adult Education Act.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Adult Education Act authorizes programs to improvethe literacy skills of adults. To the extent possible, LEA funds availableunder the Adult Education Act could be used to assist eligible parentsof Chapter 1 children to increase proficiency in basic skills in orderfor them to have the skills for meaningful participation in their children'sChapter 1 program. Chapter 1 funds may be used to increase the level ofsupport available under the Adult Education Act. By working together, theseprograms can assist the maximum number of parents of Chapter 1 childrento be involved in and contribute to the success of the Chapter 1 program.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that one of the goals be expandedto state, ``Understand the program and its legal requirements, work withteachers and understand and evaluate curriculum * * *.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The goals included in andSection; 200.34(b) reiteratethose included in section 1016(b) of the Act. While the Secretary agreesthat the activity suggested by the commenter is allowable, he does notbelieve that additional goals are necessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that it be made clear that parentalobservations should include the requirement that they be conducted underthe rules for parental observation of the school district.<T3>Discussion: </T3>While andSection; 200.34(c)(3)(iv) of the regulationsrequires LEAs to permit parents to observe Chapter 1 LEA activities, itis assumed that the LEA has established or will establish procedures toimplement this requirement. Nothing in the regulations is intended to contraveneduly established LEA procedures regarding parental observation of children'sactivities.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that parents be consulted aboutplans for program improvement and informed about the results of programevaluation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(a) of the Act requires that the LEA makepublic the results of its annual review of Chapter 1: section 1451(b) ofthe Act requires that parents be included on the State committee of practitionersto advise the State on its program improvement plan; section 1021(b)(1)(B)of the Act requires that the LEA's program improvement plan be made availableto parents of Chapter 1 children; and section 1020(d) of the Act requiresthat parents be consulted in development and implementation of the SEA-LEAjoint plan for program assistance in a school failing to show improvement.The Secretary believes these provisions provide sufficient authority tomeet the commenter's goal without additional regulations.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested clarification of the phrase,``to the extent practicable'' to avoid misinterpretation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The inclusion of this phrase in section 1016(b)(6)of the Act recognizes that local conditions may affect the manner of implementationof this provision. The Secretary does not believe that further regulationto define the phrase would be helpful, since local conditions vary widely.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulations clarifythat parents of private school children be included in parent involvementactivities.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1016 of the Act sets out the requirementsfor involving ``parents of participating children'' in the Chapter 1 LEAProgram. This section does not differentiate between parents of publicschool children and parents of private school children. The Secretary believesthe parent involvement requirements apply to all parents of participatingchildren.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.34(a) has been changed to make explicit thatan LEA must implement activities for the involvement of parents of participatingpublic and private school children.Section 200.35 What Are the Requirements for Evaluating and Reporting ProjectResults?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter noted that timelines for LEA and SEA evaluationsand for submission of information in the performance report differ. Thecommenter suggested they be made the same.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The timelines are prescribed in section 1019 of theAct. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters asked whether the evaluation measuresrequired under andSection; 200.35(a) also apply to the program improvementrequirements in andSection; 200.38. Specifically, the commenters questionedwhether measures developed pursuant to the national standards in SubpartH had to be used as part of the local review required by andSection; 200.38(a).<T3>Discussion: </T3>Consistent with sections 1021 (b)(1) and (f) of theAct, andSection;andSection; 200.38 (a)(1)(i), (b)(1), and (d)(1) make clearthat LEAs must assess both aggregate performance and substantial progresstoward meeting desired outcomes in determining which schools and studentsare in need of program improvement. The Secretary believes that the provisionsin sections 1021 (a)(3) and (b)(1) of the Act, which tie the results ofevaluations under section 1019 to program improvement efforts, requirean LEA to use the measures used under andSection; 200.35(a) to assess bothaggregate and individual performance under andSection; 200.38. Other measures,determined by the LEA, may be used to assess progress toward desired outcomes.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested adding in andSection; 200.35(a)suggested methods to measure progress toward meeting desired outcomes.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that further guidance on desiredoutcomes is needed. Rather than including this guidance in andSection; 200.35(a),however, he has added a definition of desired outcomes in andSection; 200.6(c).<T3>Changes:</T3> A definition of desired outcomes has been added in andSection;200.6(c). As that definition indicates, desired outcomes may be expressedin terms of indicators such as improved aggregate performance, improvedstudent performance measured by criterion-referenced tests, lower dropoutrates, improved attendance, and fewer retentions in grade.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the requirement for determiningsustained gains be limited to children attending schools participatingin the Chapter 1 program, rather than children who received Chapter 1 serviceslast year but are currently enrolled in a non-Chapter 1 school in the LEA,as required under andSection; 200.35(a)(2)(ii).<T3>Discussion: </T3>The purpose of the sustained gains requirement isto determine if the positive effects of Chapter 1 remain over time. Itis important for LEAs to know if, as a child moves from a participatingschool to a school not in the Chapter 1 program, the gains made in Chapter1 continue.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested that the regulations clarifythat the provision in andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(i)(B) excluding preschool,kindergarten, and first grade children from the requirement for reportingstudent achievement data does not remove the requirement that the effectivenessof the Chapter 1 program on these children be assessed.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary concurs that LEAs are required to assessthe effectiveness of the Chapter 1 LEA Program on all children served,including those in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade. The exclusionin andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(i)(B) from reporting aggregate achievement data,contained in section 1019(c) of the Act, recognizes the paucity of validaggregatable measures for children in these age groups. However, section1021(a) of the Act, requiring LEAs to annually review the effectivenessof their Chapter 1 programs, contains no such exclusion. The regulations,as written, apply the exclusion only to the aggregate achievement requirementin andSection; 200.35(a)(1)(i)(B), and not to other requirements containedin this section or other sections of the regulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern about the requirementsin andSection;andSection; 200.35(a)(2) and 200.38(a)(2) regarding the determinationof whether improved performance is sustained over a period of more than12 months. Commenters noted that the Conference Report accompanying theAct states that LEAs may implement this requirement through use of a ``samplingprocedure or carefully designed study * * * rather than trying to trackall children served at all grade levels in all subject areas * * *, ''and that this language was not included in the regulations. Another commenterquestioned the necessity of measuring sustained gains, since LEAs are notrequired to report results to the SEA. Still another commenter noted thecost involved in determining sustained effects. Additional commenters notedthe difficulty and expense in following children over a two-year period_particularlywith mobile populations and for students no longer in the Chapter 1 LEAProgram.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The provisions in andSection;andSection;200.35(a)(2) and200.38(a)(2) reiterate provisions in sections 1019(a)(3) and 1021(a)(2)of the Act, respectively. The determination by an LEA of sustained gainsis for its use in both measuring the effectiveness of its programs andmaking modifications to increase the impact of Chapter 1. The manner inwhich sustained gains may be measured is not specified in the regulations.The Secretary concurs that carefully designed studies and sampling proceduresare appropriate. Chapter 1 TACs and available to provide help to LEAs indetermining ways to measure sustained gains. The Secretary is aware thatincluding children no longer in the Chapter 1 LEA Program takes extra effortand resources. However, in order to assess the impact of Chapter 1, itis necessary to determine how well students perform after they exit theprogram.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter indicated that the commenter's State plannedto change the State testing program during the 1989-90 school year. Becausethe test used in 1988-89 would differ from that used in 1989-90, the Statewould be unable to provide any results for that annual cycle. The Staterequested that it be allowed to defer reporting results until the 1990-91school year.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary appreciates the particular problemsan annual test cycle poses to LEAs and SEAs changing testing programs fromone year to the next. This problem occurs not only in relation to reportingresults but, more importantly, in determining in which schools there wasno improvement or a decline in aggregate performance_an indicator of theneed for program improvement. However, the Secretary has no authority towaive the evaluation and reporting requirements in section 1019(a) and(b) of the Act, or the LEA annual review requirements in section 1021(a).It should be noted, however, that the State evaluation and reporting provision,which requires the SEA to conduct evaluations and report results to theSecretary, must be done at least once every two years. This would allowStates wishing to change test plans to do so in the off year. Alternatively,SEAs may wish to equate results of the two tests to determine gains, orpost-test an adequate sample of children in each grade on the initial testto provide statewide results.In relation to the annual review, LEAs may measure performance gains throughequating or other means, or apply the local condition contained in section1021(e)(5) of the Act.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the provision in andSection;200.35(b)(4)of the proposed regulations that SEAs may require LEAs to evaluate theeffect of Chapter 1 projects on children's achievement in the regular program,including writing, science, history, or other subjects. The commentersstated that this procedure could be unduly burdensome, questioned the legislativesupport for such and SEA authority, and stated that the Chapter 1 programshould be evaluated only in terms of the subject areas of Chapter 1 instruction.On the other hand, one commenter, noting that section 1001(b) of the Actgives as its purpose ``helping such children succeed in the regular programof the local educational agency,'' objected to the use of the permissive``may require'' in the regulations. This commenter stated that evaluationof Chapter 1 children's success in the regular program was an implicitrequirement of the Act.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary is sensitive to the concern of burdenraised by many commenters and wishes to make clear that the provision wasnot intended to encourage extensive additional testing of Chapter 1 children.Rather, the provision was intended to capture the added emphasis in thepurpose of the Act quoted above. In addition, the Secretary is concernedthat gains Chapter 1 children may make, as measured by standardized testsin basic skills, may not always translate into improved performance inthe regular school program or, conversely, children's progress in the regularschool program may not be reflected in the scores they receive on standardizedtests. Upon reconsideration, the Secretary continues to believe that assessmentof a child's progress in the regular program is necessary to determineif the purpose of the program is being achieved. However, the Secretarywill leave the determination of how to conduct that assessment to Stateand local officials.<T3>Changes: </T3>The provision in andSection;200.35(b)(4) has been removed,and a new provision has been added in andSection;200.35(a)(1(ii). This provisionrequires an LEA to include in its evaluation a review of chapter 1 children'sprogress in the regular program. The review may be based on teacher judgments,grades, retention rates, and other appropriate indicators of success.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the requirement in andSection;200.35(c)that SEAs must annually collect the data specified in section 1019 of theAct. The commenter noted that section 1019 does not require LEAs to submitevaluation information to SEAs every year. Moreover, SEAs are requiredto submit aggregate data based on local evaluations only once every twoyears.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.35(c) implements the requirement in section1019(b)(3) of the Act that requires an SEA to submit annually specificdemographic data concerning children participating in Chapter 1 programsin the State. Section 200.35(c) is not intended to require an SEA to submitevaluation information each year. However, some SEAs choose to do so annually.Likewise, rather than collecting data from all LEAs every two years, otherSEAs collect samples of data each year. Under andSection;200.35(c), SEAsmay, and are encouraged to, submit evaluation data as they receive them.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments were received regarding the itemslisted in the preamble of the proposed regulations that the Secretary plansto collect in the annual performance report under andSection;200.35(c). Severalcommenters expressed support for the data collection, particularly informationregarding services to children attending private schools and data on numbersof children eligible for Chapter 1 services. Some commenters, however,objected to collecting information on the number of eligible Chapter 1children, citing increased burden; others asked that the term ``eligiblechildren'' be defined to facilitate better data collection. Another commenterasked that the term ``supportive services'' be defined to include schoolsocial work and school psychological services. Other commenters noted thatthe proposed contents of the performance report exceed the requirementsin section 1019(b)(3) of the Act. Still others remarked that the provisionin andSection;200.35(c)(2) that an LEA provide to the SEA ``any data neededby the SEA to complete its annual performance report'' was not needed,since the needed information was included in the statute and regulations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary is aware that collection of informationon the number of eligible children in public and private schools may entailsome increased burden on LEAs. However, he believes the information isneeded for two major purposes. First, section 1001(a)(2)(B) of the Actdeclares it to be the intent of Congress that funding for the program beincreased annually with a goal of ``serving all eligible children by fiscalyear 1993 * * *.'' In the past, the number of eligible children has notbeen reported, and estimates of the number have varied rather widely. Inorder to provide Congress and the Department with information necessaryto meet the intent of section 1001(a)(2)(B), the Secretary believes a moreaccurate means to determine the number of eligible children is necessary.Second, concern has been expressed by representatives of private schoolchildren that the percentage of eligible private school children beingserved is lower than the percentage of public school children being served.Collection of this information will allow LEAs, SEAs, and the Departmentto address this concern.In regard to burden, the Secretary calls attention to section 1014(b) ofthe Act, which requires LEAs to ``identify educationally deprived childrenin all eligible attendance areas.'' Since these are the precise data thatwill be collected, the additional burden related to reporting them shouldbe minimal. The Secretary will specify, on the form used to collect thedata, the meaning of the terms ``eligible children'' and ``supportive services.''``Supportive services'' includes school social work and school psychologicalservices.Regarding the comment that andSection;200.35(c)(2) is not needed becausethe information to be reported is included in the Act, the Secretary notesthat not all the information he intends to collect is specifically includedin section 1019(b)(3) of the Act. The authority to collect this additionalinformation is contained in section 406A of the General Education ProvisionsAct.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 200.36 What Are the Requirements for Schoolwide Projects?<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter, noting that the option for allocationof funds to schoolwide projects contained in andSection;200.36(c)(1)(i)(B)would provide more Chapter 1 funds to the school than it would otherwisereceive, suggested its elimination, and recommended that the funding perchild in a schoolwide project be no greater than the amount per child servedin the other project schools in the LEA. Another commenter requested thatthe regulations be revised to require that allocations to schoolwide projectsbe determined by the number of educationally deprived children served tobe consistent with allocations to other Chapter 1 schools, and that a definitionof ``served'' be included. Still another commenter claimed that the regulationswould allow a vast reduction_perhaps by 50 percent or more_in Chapter 1funding for schoolwide projects by use of the method in andSection;200.36(c)(1)(i)(A).<T3>Discussion: </T3>The negotiated rulemaking group agreed on the twomethods in the proposed regulations for determining the number of educationallydeprived children in a schoolwide project: Either (1) the number of childrenin the schoolwide project below the highest ranked child served in otherproject schools in the LEA; or (2) all children meeting the definitionin andSection; 200.6(c) of ``educationally deprived children.'' The Secretarybelieves that LEAs need the flexibility of the options for allocating resourcesbetween schoolwide projects and other project schools. Although an LEAmay choose to count educationally deprived children in a schoolwide projecton the same basis as it selects participants in other project schools and,therefore, provide fewer resources for the schoolwide project than it wouldif it counted all educationally deprived children, the proposed projectmust still be of sufficient size, scope, and quality to give reasonablepromise of success. Moreover, this option was requested by LEAs and SEAsthat were concerned that resources would be directed away from other projectschools if LEAs were required to fund schoolwide projects on the basisof all educationally deprived children. Lastly, since a schoolwide projectmust meet the needs of all children in the school, including all educationallydeprived children, the Secretary does not believe that a definition of``served'' is necessary. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that allowable costs for schoolwideprojects be focused on educational activities rather than being spent inother ways not specifically directed at improving the education of children.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Subsections (a) and (d) of section 1015 of the Actmake clear that allowable costs must be focused on educational activities.The purpose of schoolwide projects, as specified in section 1015, is tomake it possible for an LEA to carry out a project to upgrade the entireeducational program in an eligible school. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned if it was allowable to commingleState and local funds for meeting the per pupil expenditure requirementin andSection; 200.36(c)(2). <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.36(c)(2) requires that the LEA spend perchild at least the same amount of State and local funds in a schoolwideproject as it spent in the preceding year. The amount is an aggregate amountrather than by each funding source. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether an LEA would have toallocate additional funds to schoolwide projects from sources other thanChapter 1 in order to have sufficient size, scope, and quality. The commenterwas concerned about the impact such an allocation would have on other schoolsin the LEA. <T3>Discussion: </T3>As a result of the negotiated rulemaking process,consensus was reached on retaining the regulatory requirement that LEAsprovide sufficient funds for a schoolwide project to ensure that the projectis of sufficient size, scope, and quality to give reasonable promise ofsuccess. Normally, this requirement would be met with Chapter 1 funds.However, if Chapter 1 funds are insufficient to meet this requirement,additional funds, which could come from other Federal funds or State orlocal funds, would need to be used. The decision is that of the LEA. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was concerned that section 1015 of theAct appears to put a dollar figure on expenditures each year and questionedif it would be possible to spend more in the first year and less in thesecond and third years, then average total expenditures for the three-yearperiod. The commenter noted that, in some circumstances, start-up costsfor schoolwide projects could be higher than costs in subsequent years.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Chapter 1 funding for schoolwide projects is basedon the number of educationally deprived children in the school as determinedby the LEA using one of the two options specified in andSection; 200.36(c)(1)(i)of the regulations. Since section 1015(b)(6)(A) of the Act requires thatChapter 1 funds in a schoolwide project equal or exceed the amount perchild made available in other project schools, the Secretary interpretsthe Act to require that expenditures be reviewed annually. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that LEAs be allowed to applyfor money to conduct schoolwide projects based on a proposal that wouldmeet the same goals but cost less money than following the regulations.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1015(b)(6)(A) of the Act specifies that LEAsmust make available for schoolwide projects Chapter 1 funds that per educationallydeprived child in the schoolwide project equal or exceed the amount expendedper child served in Chapter 1 projects in the LEA's other schools. TheSecretary believes that andSection; 200.36(c)(1)(i) of the regulations, whichwas agreed to during negotiated rulemaking, provides the maximum flexibilityallowed by the statute. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked how achievement data are to be usedwhen demonstrating program improvement. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.36(f)(4) of the regulations implementssection 1015(e)(3) of the Act which requires that LEAs shall annually collectachievement and other assessment data for each school participating ina schoolwide project. Section 200.36(f)(5) of the regulations providesthat the program improvement requirements in andSection;andSection; 200.37-200.38apply to schoolwide projects. Therefore, if a school implementing a schoolwideproject does not show substantial progress toward meeting the desired outcomesdescribed in the LEA's application or shows no improvement or a declinein aggregate performance, the LEA shall implement the requirements forschool program improvement in andSection; 200.38(b)(2). <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification on how evaluationdata would be collected and used in determining whether a schoolwide projectcould be continued beyond the original three-year period. The commenterdid not think the proposed regulations were sufficiently clear. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.36(f) of the regulations requires an LEAto collect achievement and other assessment data annually for each schoolparticipating in a schoolwide project. In order for a school to continueas a schoolwide project, the LEA must demonstrate that after three yearsthe achievement gains of educationally deprived children in the schoolwideproject exceed the average gains of comparable participating children inthe LEA as a whole, or comparable educationally deprived children in thesame school for the three years prior to the implementation of the schoolwideproject. The Secretary does not believe additional clarification is necessary.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter, though highly supportive of the regulations,recommended that, to provide additional local flexibility, the size, scope,and quality requirement and program improvement provisions be deleted.The commenter also requested that the regulations provide additional specificationsfor accountability to provide LEAs with more guidance on this requirement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1015(c) of the Act relieves the LEA from complyingwith certain requirements of this part. However, the Act does not exemptschoolwide projects from the size, scope, and quality requirements in section1012(c) of the program improvement requirements in section 1021. The Secretarybelieves the accountability requirements in andSection; 200.36(f) of theregulations, which generally reflect section 1015(e) of the Act, and andSection;andSection;200.37-200.38 related to program improvement provide sufficient guidance.The addition of more specific requirements might unduly restrict Stateand local agencies. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters requested deletion of the requirementapplying the program improvement provisions to schoolwide projects, andargued that it was confusing, duplicative, and fails to recognize the differencesthat Congress intended for this type of project. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(b) of the Act requires LEAs to implementprogram improvement activities in ``each school which does not show substantialprogress toward meeting the desired outcomes * * * or shows no improvementor a decline in aggregate performance of children served under this chapter* * *.'' This provision applies to all schools served by Chapter 1_whetheror not the schoolwide project approach is used. In addition, the applicabilityof the program improvement requirements to schoolwide projects was agreedto by all participants in the negotiated rulemaking process. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned what would happen with the largeamount of money spent for a schoolwide project after three years if, evenwith SEA assistance for school improvement, improvement did not occur.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Unless the LEA fails to comply with the requirementsunder this part or incurs unallowable expenditures, there would be no basisfor determining that the funds spent for an unsuccessful schoolwide projectbe disallowed. Therefore, an LEA would not be required to repay to theSEA the amount expended for a schoolwide project over the three-year period.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned when it would be inappropriatefor an LEA to move to implement an effective schools program as statedin section 1015(b)(1)(E) of the Act. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1015(b) of the Act requires that a plan bedeveloped for each school implementing a schoolwide project. The plan mustinclude, if appropriate, a description of ``how the school will move toimplement an effective schools program as defined in section 1471'' ofthe Act. The definition of ``effective schools program'' contains veryspecific components. If an LEA wishes to implement an effective schoolsprogram in a schoolwide project school, it should include in its plan howit would do so. However, an LEA may decide to address the needs of thechildren in the schoolwide project through other approaches. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether the writing of a schoolwideproject plan could be considered the first year of the project. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The SEA, if it finds that the plan meets the requirementof the Act, shall approve the plan for a period of three years. This periodbegins with implementation of the plan and does not include time devotedto planning prior to establishment of the schoolwide project. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned if a single SEA/LEA could operatea schoolwide project, since the Act refers only to LEAs <T3>Discussion: </T3>This comment refers to agencies that are both a Stateeducational agency and a local educational agency, e.g., Puerto Rico, theDistrict of Columbia, and Hawaii. Such agencies may operate a schoolwideproject. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned what grades could be servedunder a schoolwide project if a plan covers a specific grade span withina school. The commenter apparently believes that a schoolwide project maybe limited to certain grades within the school. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1015(a) of the Act gives as the purpose ofa schoolwide project to upgrade the entire educational program in an eligibleschool. A plan, therefore, could not restrict the project to only someof the grades in the school. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the regulations allow anyschool where all students receive free lunches to qualify automaticallyto be a schoolwide Chapter 1 project so that a district that collects thisincome information every three years would not have to collect it annuallyfor schoolwide project schools. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 2001.36(a)(2) of the regulations specifiesthat an LEA may conduct a Chapter 1 schoolwide project if, for the firstyear of the three-year project, the LEA determines, using the same measuresof low-income used to identify and rank school attendance areas under andSection;200.30(c), that at least 75 percent of the children residing in the schoolattendance area or enrolled in the school are from low-income families.If eligibility for free school lunches is used to identify and rank schoolattendance areas under andSection; 200.30(c), the LEA must provide such datafor the first project year for a school conducting a schoolwide project,and is not required to make the determination of eligibility again duringthe three-year period. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters requested an addition to clarify that LEAsneed not seek written permission from all parents in a schoolwide projectschool for their children to participate in project activities. The commenterswere concerned with the burden involved in collecting these permissions.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1015(b)(2)-(3) of the Act requires that parentsbe involved in the development of the plan, that they be consulted regardingthe educational progress of all students, and that they participate inthe development and implementation of accountability measures. There isno requirement that written permission be obtained from parents for theirchildren to participate in project activities, either in the Act or theregulations. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the regulations containrequirements for frequent monitoring of schoolwide projects to be conductedby the SEA and the LEA to ensure that funds and services are not beingdiverted from the most needy students to those whose needs are less. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Schoolwide projects use Chapter 1 funds in attendanceareas with very high concentrations of poor children to improve the instructionalprogram in the entire school. These activities will, by definition, benefitall children in these schools. However, section 1015(b)(1)(A)-(B) requiresthat an LEA's schoolwide project plan assess ``in particular the specialneeds of educationally deprived children'' and ``ensure that educationallydeprived children are served effectively and demonstrate performance gainscomparable to other students.'' Moreover, the accountability measures insection 1015(e) of the Act require the LEA to examine the progress of educationallydeprived children. Thus, the LEA must ensure that the needs of educationallydeprived children are met, even in a schoolwide project. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter felt the provisions discussing supplement,not supplant requirements in these regulations were ambiguous or contradictory.<T3>Discussion</T3>: The supplement, not supplant requirements in andSection;200.36 are not contradictory. Section 200.36(c)(3) requires that an LEAmake all non-Federal funds available to a schoolwide project school thatthe LEA would have made available were there no Chapter 1 project in thatschool. In other words, the Chapter 1 funds must be supplemental to non-Federalfunds the school would otherwise receive. However, since schoolwide projectsupgrade the instructional program of the entire school, andSection; 200.36(d)(2)(iii)of the regulations relieves the LEA from demonstrating that services paidfor with Chapter 1 funds supplement services regularly provided in theschool. In other words Chapter 1 funds may be used to provide regular instructionalservices. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: Commenters requested a clarification of the term ``commingling''as it is used in andSection; 200.36(d) of the proposed regulations. Commenterswere concerned that the provision would allow funds received under thispart to be combined with other funds in a way that would cause grant fundsto lose identity. <T3>Discussion</T3>: In accordance with section 1015(c)(2)(A) of the Act,the proposed regulations provided that, for each school that has a schoolwideproject plan approved by the SEA, and LEA does not have to comply withany Chapter 1 requirements prohibiting the commingling of funds availableunder this part with State and local funds. The Secretary interprets theprovision to mean that the LEA does not have to demonstrate that Chapter1 funds benefit only educationally deprived children. The Secretary doesnot interpret the commingling provision in section 1015(c)(2)(A) to excusean LEA from documenting separately that Chapter 1 funds have, in fact,been spent in a schoolwide project. The LEA must keep records to documentthe expenditure of Chapter 1 funds in a schoolwide project in order todetermine compliance with the restrictions on carryover funds under andSection;200.46 and that the funds are spent within the period of availability providedunder section 412(b) of GEPA. <T3>Changes</T3>: Section 236(d)(2)(i) of the regulations has been revisedto clarify the term ``commingling.'' In addition, andSection; 200.36(c)(5)has been added to the regulations to clarify the LEAs must keep recordsto document expenditure of funds under this part in a schoolwide project.<T3>Comment</T3>: None. <T3>Discussion</T3>: Internal review by the Department revealed that theaccountability requirements for schoolwide projects contained in andSection;200.36(f)(1) (i) and (ii) could be misunderstood. Specifically the provisionsreferred to a comparison of the ``achievement level'' of educationallydeprived children in the schoolwide project to that of similar Chapter1 children in other schools in the LEA or with children who attended theschool in the three years prior to the institution of the schoolwide project.Use of the term ``achievement level'' could be interpreted to mean a comparisonof average scores of the two groups, when the intention is to compare therelative gains made by each group. <T3>Changes</T3>: Paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of andSection; 200.36 ofthe regulations have been modified to make clear that the basis for comparisonsare gains in achievement. Section 200.37 What Are an SEA's Responsibilities for Program Improvement?<T3>Comment</T3>: Numerous commenters expressed concern that the activitieslisted in andSection; 200.37(a)(iv) through which an SEA may provide programimprovement assistance to LEAs are, for the most part, activities carriedout by LEAs, not SEAs. The commenters suggested, therefore, that the finalregulations add different modifiers such as ``identifying and helping LEAsadapt'' curricula that have shown promise in similar schools rather than``developing'' such curricula. Other commenters recommended that the programimprovement activities be shared, noting that the regulations have a toneof SEA dominance. Two commenters expressed concern that the program improvementactivities place too much responsibility on SEAs and remove the major responsibilityfrom LEAs, where they believe it belongs. <T3>Discussion</T3>: The activities listed in andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(iv)of the proposed regulations are contained in section 1020(a)(2) of theAct. In implementing that section, the Secretary did not intend to suggestthat SEAs must take over traditional LEA responsibilities. Rather, theSecretary believes that section 1020(a)(2) intends that SEAs and LEAs workcooperatively in program improvement efforts. In the end, those effortsmust be carried out at the local level, and nothing in section 1020 orsection 1021 relieves an LEA of that responsibility. However, those sectionsrecognize the SEAs can provide invaluable assistance, such as identifyingcurricula that have shown promise in similar schools, helping to trainand retrain staff, and identifying successful programs to replicate andassisting LEAs in that replication. In turn, that assistance may enableLEAs to improve their Chapter 1 programs in the project schools, therebyachieving the ultimate goal of Chapter 1_to meet the special educationalneeds of educationally deprived children. <T3>Changes</T3>: The language preceding the list of program assistanceactivities in andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(iv) has been revised to more accuratelyreflect that in the statute. <T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter questioned what constitutes ``in consultationwith'' the committee of practitioners, parents, and school staff. <T3>Discussion</T3>: Consultation is a term that may have different meaningsdepending upon the context in which it occurs and the matter under consideration.In general, consultation should be organized, systematic, ongoing, informed,and timely in relation to the decisions to be made. Consultation impliesa cooperative effort through which an SEA or LEA genuinely solicits theideas and recommendations of others_be they the committee of practitioners,school staff, or parents_before decisions are made. It does not necessarilymean, however, approval by those persons. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters recommended that under andSection; 200.37(b)(2),an LEA should be able to apply to the SEA for program improvement fundsappropriated under section 1405 as soon as the LEA identifies a schoolin need of assistance. Other commenters asked whether these funds couldbe used for LEA plans under andSection; 200.38(b)(2)-(5) or whether theywere only for joint SEA/LEA plans under andSection; 200.38(b)(6). <T3>Discussion</T3>: Section 1021(c) of the Act authorizes an LEA to applyto the SEA for program improvement assistance funds appropriated undersection 1405. Section 1405(b)(2) of the Act states that those funds mayonly be used for direct educational services in schools implementing programimprovement plans under section 1021. It does not limit the use of fundsto joint SEA/LEA plans. However, section 1405(b)(3) requires that parentsof participating children, school staff, the LEA, and the SEA must jointlyagree to the selection of providers of technical assistance and the bestuse of the funds. Thus, nothing precludes an LEA from applying for programimprovement funds as soon as the LEA identifies a school in need of assistance.However, the LEA must reach the requisite agreement as to how those fundswill be used. <T3>Changes</T3>: None. <T3>Comment</T3>: Several comments were received regarding the provisionin andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(i) permitting an SEA to establish minimum standardsto be included in the SEA's program improvement plan. Some commenters supportedthe provision. Other commenters suggested the provision be deleted, givingthe following reasons to support their positions. Some commenters arguedthat an SEA's minimum standards would tend to automatically become theLEA's standards, discouraging LEAs from setting higher standards they mightotherwise establish. One commenter questioned the legislative authorityfor State standards, contending that this was an LEA function. Anothercommenter noted that LEAs would establish their own minimum standards insetting desired outcomes. Another commenter requested clarification ofthe meaning of the word ``standards.'' The commenter noted that section1020(a)(1) of the Act uses the phrase ``objective measures and standards''to mean a method of measurement, whereas the term ``minimum standards''in the regulations appears to refer to an acceptable level of performance.Finally, one commenter expressed concern that children failing to meetthe standard would be eliminated from the program and that failure to thesestudents to meet standards will lower average achievement for the district.This commenter further expressed concern that LEAs, in setting standards,should take into account the difficulty certain students might encounterin meeting them. <T3>Discussion: </T3>By including the work ``minimum'' as a modifier topossible SEA standards, the Secretary did not mean to imply that thesestandards should be the only standards to apply to all LEAs or all schools.Rather, the intention was to allow SEAs to set a floor, with the clearimplication that, to the extent appropriate, LEAs could and should establishhigher levels of expected performance, and that SEAs, in reviewing LEAapplications, would ensure that this had been done. However, because ofthe apparent confusion caused by the use of the term, it has been deletedfrom the final regulations.With regard to legislative authority for SEAs to set standards, the Secretarybelieves it is implicit in the requirement in section 1020(a) of the Actthat the State have a program improvement plan; that it is in the section1012(b) of the Act, which requires an SEA to approve LEA applications,which must include the LEA's desired outcomes; and that it is in the generalauthority in section 1451(a) of the Act for States to issue regulations.The Secretary concurs with the commenter's remarks regarding the use ofthe term ``standards'' in the Act and the regulations. As used in andSection;200.37(a)(2)(i), the term means a level of acceptable performance.Finally, the standard is not to be used to deny services to children whofail to meet it; rather, failure to meet the standard would, under theprogram improvement requirements, result in modification of the way inwhich children are served. The commenter is correct that scores of studentsfailing to meet the standard will lower aggregate achievement scores. Thisis true whether or not a standard is set. With regard to the commenter'sconcern that some children might encounter difficulty in meeting a presetstandard, the Secretary believes the purpose of Chapter 1 is to enableChapter 1 children to achieve at a level commensurate with their peers,and that in designing projects and allocating resources, LEAs should takeinto account the special difficulties some children may have.<T3>Changes: </T3>The word ``minimum'' has been deleted from andSection;200.37(a)(2)(i) of the regulations.Section 200.38 What Are an LEA's Responsibilities for Program Improvement?<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters, noting that the term ``aggregateperformance'' might be interpreted in different ways, requested that itsmeaning be clarified.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Under section 1021(b)(1) of the Act, an LEA must identifyany school that ``shows no improvement or a decline in ``aggregate performance''of children served'' under Chapter 1 as needing program improvement. TheSecretary concurs that a clarification of the term ``aggregate performance''would be helpful. In addition, the Secretary believes it would be helpfulto define the circumstances under which no improvement or a decline inaggregate performance will trigger program improvement when aggregate performancein one instructional area shows gain, performance in another instructionalarea declines.<T3>Changes: </T3>A definition of ``aggregate performance'' has been addedto andSection; 200.6(c). In addition, andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii) has beenadded to clarify that, at a minimum, an LEA is required to use the aggregateperformance of only the instructional area that is the primary focus ofthe Chapter 1 program to determine if program improvement activities arerequired, unless the project addresses two or more instructional areaswith relatively equal emphasis. Further, because aggregate performance,as defined in andSection; 200.6(c), must be measured in accordance with thenational standards in Subpart H, the references to section 1019 of theAct in andSection;andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(i) and 200.38(b)(1)(ii)(A) havebeen deleted.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulations clarifythat an LEA may select as its desired outcomes the same objectives as identifiedto assess aggregate performance. Another commenter expressed concern thatthe need for program improvement not be based solely on one test scoreand suggested that there be other determining factors.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Under section 1012(b) of the Act, an LEA must includedesired outcomes in its application. These desired outcomes may be expressedin terms of such indicators as lower dropout rates, improved student performancemeasured by criterion-referenced tests, improved attendance, fewer retentionsin grade, and improved aggregate performance. At a minimum, an LEA's desiredoutcomes must be expressed in terms of aggregate performance in accordancewith andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii). Thus, subject to any overall standardestablished in the State's plan, the LEA may use the standards for aggregateperformance in section 1021(b) of the Act as its desired outcomes. In addition,the LEA is encouraged to establish desired outcomes that exceed the minimumin section 1021(b) or that are measured by other indicators such as thosedescribed above in order to achieve a more complete picture of the successof the Chapter 1 program.<T3>Changes: </T3>A definition of ``desired outcomes'' has been added toandSection; 200.6(c), which indicates that these outcomes may be expressedin terms of aggregate performance as well as other measures.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether desired outcomes had to bewritten in numerical terms.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Desired outcomes must be expressed in terms that canbe measured. However, they do not have to be expressed in terms of norm-referencedtests, unless the only desired outcomes an LEA establishes are those relatingto aggregate performance.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter opposed the requirement in andSection; 200.38(a)(1)(i)that an LEA conduct an annual review of project effectiveness because itexceeds the statutory requirement that project evaluations be conductedevery three years.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(a) of the Act requires each LEA to ``conductan annual review of the program's effectiveness in improving student performance.''Section 200.38(a)(1)(i) of the final regulations merely implements thisstatutory requirement. Certainly, the information gathered pursuant tothe annual review requirement may be used by the LEA in fulfilling itsthree-year evaluation requirement under section 1019(a) of the Act.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if an LEA must look at data in theregular program to assess progress in mathematics, reading, and other instructionalareas.<T3>Discussion: </T3>While there is no specific requirement that an LEAlook at data in the regular program in conducting its annual review undersection 1021(a) of the Act, section 1001(b) of the Act makes clear thathelping participating children succeed in the regular program is a purposeof Chapter 1. Therefore, consistent with this purpose, an LEA may establishas one of its desired outcomes that students demonstrate progress in theregular program. In that case, the LEA would need to look at data fromthe regular program in conducting the annual review. In addition, andSection;200.35(a)(2)(ii) of the final regulations requires an LEA to include inits evaluation under section 1019(a) of the Act a review of Chapter 1 children'sprogress in the regular program.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that aggregated data should becollected for at least two years because data from only one year may produceinvalid results in small schools with fewer than 25 children.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(a)(1) of the Act requires that an LEAconduct an <T3>annual</T3> review. Thus, there is no authority for an LEA to collectdata over a two-year period. However, the LEA may take into considerationthe standard error of measurement, which is greater when small numbersof children are evaluated.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters recommended that the results of theannual review under andSection; 200.38(a)(1) be made available to privateschool officials, in order that they have needed information about theeffectiveness of the project.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1021(a)(1) of the Act requires that an LEA``make the results [of the annual review] available to teachers, parentsof participating children, and other appropriate parties.'' Clearly, privateschool officials who have children participating in the Chapter 1 LEA Programare ``other appropriate parties'' as identified in section 1021(a)(1).Therefore, an LEA must make the annual review results available to them.``Other appropriate parties'' would also include public school officialssuch as principals of schools with Chapter 1 projects.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.38(a)(1)(ii) has been revised to make clearthat ``other appropriate parties'' to which an LEA must make availablethe results of its annual review includes principals of schools (both publicand private) attended by Chapter 1 children.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether a sustained effectsstudy must be done annually under andSection; 200.38(a)(2) and whether thisstudy is in addition to the sustained effects study an LEA must conductonce every three years under andSection; 200.35(a)(2).<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1019(a)(3) of the Act requires that an LEA,at least once every three years, determine whether the improved performanceof participating children is sustained over a period of more than one programyear. Section 1021(a)(2) of the Act requires that, as part of the localreview for program improvement, the LEA annually determine whether improvedstudent performance is sustained over a period of more than one programyear. As a result of the commenter's question and upon further review,the Secretary interprets section 1021(a)(2) of the Act as referring toimproved performance of any schools implementing a program improvementplan under andSection; 200.38(b)(2)-(5) or a joint plan under andSection; 200.38(b)(6).That is, the LEA must annually review the peformance of schools implementingimprovement plans until improved performance is sustained over a periodof more than 12 months.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.38(a)(2) has been revised to clarify thatthe determination refers to the requirement in andSection; 200.38(b)(6)(iv)(C).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned how sustained gains under andSection;200.38(a)(2) can be measured when many children leave a school during theschool year.<T3>Discussion: </T3>As discussed above, the Secretary interprets the ``substainedgains'' requirement in andSection; 200.38(a)(2) to refer to determinationsof whether improved performance of schools undergoing school program improvementis sustained for more than 12 months, as required under section 1021(h)of the Act. However, andSection; 200.35(a)(2) requires an LEA to measuresustained gains of individual children. Under the requirement, the LEAis not required to measure sustained gains for children who transfer toschools outside the LEA during the school year. However, the LEA can andmust track children who transfer to other schools within the LEA and measurewhether their gains have been sustained.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned what triggers program inprovementunder andSection; 200.38(b)(1). For example, the commenter noted the aggregatingperformance for a school may combine multiple projects and hide an unsuccessfulcomponent in the gains of successful components. On the other hand, measuringthe success of each project in a school could lead to identification ofa school as deficient in one area when, on the whole, it is successful.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(b)(1) of the Act refers to school programimprovement and makes clear that, for this requirement, aggregate performancefor Chapter 1 students in the school shall be one measure used to selectschools for program improvement activities. Therefore, LEAs must aggregatestudent scores, by instructional area, for the entire school and use thataggregate score as one measure to determine if program improvement effortsare required. It two or more instructional areas are included in the projectat the school, results for each instructional area must be aggregated separately,and the principle contained in andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii) applied to determineif program improvement is required.The Secretary agrees that use of aggregate data may mask poor performanceat centain grades, or for some students, but notes that section 1021(f)of the Act and andSection; 200.38(d) of the regulations, related to studentprogram improvement, require LEAs to take steps to ensure that, withinschools with overall achievement gains, the needs of students who are notprogressing will be addressed.<T3>Changes: </T3>Definition of ``aggregate performance'' and ``desiredoutcomes'' has been added in andSection; 200.6(c). In addition, andSection;200.38(b)(1)(ii) has been revised to conform to the new definitions andto clarify how aggregate performance is to be determined.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated the andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii) setsa standard of zero normal curve equivalent (NCE) point gain as the aggregateperformance basis to determine if a school is in need of program improvement,since the regulation defines a school to be selected as one that showsno improvement or a decline in aggregate performance. The commenter suggestedthat this provision contradicts andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(i), which givesan SEA authority to establish standards that may be higher than zero NCEgain.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The standard in andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii) is containedin section 1021(b)(1) of the Act. Using the Department's common reportingscale, this becomes a zero NCE performance. Thus, at a minimum, a schoolmust be identified as needing program improvement if it shows no improvementor a decline in the aggregate performance of its children. However, anSEA in establishing standards in accordance with andSection; 200.37(a)(2)(i),or an LEA in its application may establish a higher standard for identifyingschools in need of program improvement. This would be done by establishingdesired outcomes that reflect those higher standards.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked how equity could be achieved ifmore resources are devoted to schools and students in need of program improvement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Nothing in Chapter 1 demands that every child receivethe same per pupil amount of services. Rather, as indicated in andSection;200.33(a), resources should be allocated to a school according to the numberand needs of the children to be served, the degree of educational deprivationof the children, and the services to be provided. As a result, childrenwith more severe needs may receive added resources. Likewise, childrenand schools in need of program improvement may also require additionalresources to meet their needs.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that more than one year beallowed to show improvement under andSection; 200.38(b) (2)-(5) before implementinga joint SEA/LEA plan. The commenter argued that it often takes a year justto train teachers, develop new materials, and implement the new programin the classroom. Another commenter suggested that SEAs should encourageLEAs to consider two- or three-year plans. The commenter suggested theseLEA plans could establish yearly benchmarks and the joint SEA/LEA plancould then modify the LEA plans as needed instead of disrupting the processwith a new joint plan.<T3>Discussion: </T3>According to the Conference Report accompanying theAct, the conferees intended the SEAs and LEAs have ``no more than, butat least, one full school year during which the plan is in effect beforejudging its effectiveness is raising aggregate student performance.'' H.R.Rept. 567, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 326 (1988). Section 200.38(b)(5)(ii) ofthe final regulations implements this intent. If improvement is not demonstratedafter the full school year, section 1021(d) of the Act requires the SEAand LEA to develop a joint plan. Nothing in the statute or regulations,however, requires the joint plan to be radically different from the LEA'soriginal plan. The SEA and LEA may adopt the LEA's plan as the joint planif they decide that the LEA's plan is adequate and merely needs more timeto effect the desired changes.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked if an SEA could identify for itsLEAs those schools in need of program improvement. Another commenter askedwhether an LEA is required by the Act or the regulations to provide individualschool achievement data to the SEA unless the school is in need of programimprovement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(b) of the Act makes clear that the identificationof schools in need of program improvement, and development and implementationof the initial school improvement plan, is the responsibility of the LEA.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter opposed the requirement in andSection; 200.38(b)(3)(i)that an LEA submit plans for school improvement to the SEA for the firstyear of implementation, because only minor changes may be needed in itsongoing project. The commenter, however, supported submitting the plansin the second or third years if appropriate. Other commenters suggestedthat the plans should be available to the SEA, rather than be submittedto the SEA. Another commenter asked whether the plans must be submittedto the SEA for approval, or only for review.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(b)(1)(B) of the Act requires an LEA tosubmit to the SEA the plan for any school identified as needing programimprovement. Thus, the LEA must submit each plan, even for the first yearof the plan's implementation, and may not merely make it available to theSEA. The plans are not submitted for SEA approval; however, section 1012(b)of the Act, which requires SEA approval of LEA applications, does providegeneral approval authority to SEAs of the entire LEA project, which willinclude program improvement activities. Moreover, the SEA could certainlyprovide technical assistance to the LEA, if requested. In addition, underandSection; 200.37(b)(1)(ii)(A) of the final regulations, the SEA must, withthe least possible paperwork and burden, follow the progress of any schoolidentified by an LEA under andSection; 200.38(b)(1).<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the SEA be involved in allphases of the program improvement process.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Under section 1021 of the Act, an LEA is responsiblefor identifying initially the schools in need of program improvement andimplementing school improvement plans in those schools. The LEA must submitthe plans to the SEA in accordance with section 1021(b)(1)(B). At thispoint, the SEA must follow the progress of the schools undergoing programimprovement as required by andSection; 200.37(b)(1)(ii)(A). Therefore, thereis some involvement of the SEA during the initial plan. However, it isnot until a joint plan is required that the SEA becomes substantively involvedin the program improvement process. Of course, the SEA could provide technicalassistance at any time.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters commented on the provision in andSection;200.38(b)(4)(i) that relieves an LEA from developing a school improvementplan for a school that served 10 or fewer children for the entire schoolyear. Some commenters supported the provision. Others recommended thatthe number be increased to 20 or 30 children so that aggregate performancewould be more stable and staff resources would be utilized more efficiently.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(b)(2) of the Act exempts from the programimprovement requirements only schools that have 10 or fewer children servedduring an entire program year.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended revising andSection; 200.38(b)(4)(ii)to make clear that an SEA has the authority to determine when a schoolimprovement plan under development does not need to be implemented.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.38(b)(4)(ii) of the final regulationsauthorizes an LEA, not an SEA, to make the decision that a school improvementplan is no longer needed because data have become available demonstratingthat the requisite improvement has occurred.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters opposed the timeline under whichan SEA and LEA had to develop and implement a joint plan in andSection; 200.38(b)(6)of the proposed regulations. Commenters noted the difficulty involved indeveloping a new plan during the summer, because school personnel are notalways available then. In addition, commenters noted the new plan mightrequire personnel changes and staff development activities that could notbe done prior to the opening of school in the fall. Several commentersrecommended that the joint plan be implemented by a realistic date agreedupon by the SEA and LEA or by the second school year.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.38(b)(6) of the proposed regulations requiredan SEA/LEA joint plan to be developed and implemented by the beginningof the school year following the full year the LEA's plan was in effect.Essentially, this provision allowed, at most, only three months duringthe summer to develop and implement the joint plan. Moreover, if an LEAwas on a fall-fall testing cycle, the LEA would likely not even have hadthe data it needed to determine whether a joint plan was needed until afterthe beginning of the next school year. Therefore, the Secretary has determinedthat, in some instances, more time may be needed for SEAs and LEAs to developand fully implement joint plans. The final regulations require that a jointplan be developed and fully implemented as soon as possible but no laterthan by the beginning of the second school year following the full yearduring which the LEA's plan was in effect. However, to ensure that thisextension does not result in ineffective programs continuing for anotherfull year to the detriment of educationally deprived children, andSection;200.38(b)(6)(iii)(B) requires the SEA and LEA to implement portions ofthe joint plan as soon as possible in those cases in which full implementationrequires the maximum time allowed.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.38(b)(6) has been revised to permit an additionalyear for an SEA and LEA to develop and fully implement a joint plan. However,if the maximum time is required, andSection; 200.38(b)(6)(iii)(B) requiresportions of the plan to be implemented as soon as possible.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if an SEA has authority to withholdapproval of an LEA's application if agreement regarding a joint plan cannotbe reached between the SEA and LEA as required under section 1021(i) ofthe Act. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1012(a) of the Act requires that the SEA ensurethat its LEAs comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisionspertaining to programs under this part. Section 1012(b) of the Act requiresthat the SEA approve the LEA's application. Further, andSection; 200.38(b)(6)section 1021(i) of the Act requires that a joint plan under this part mustbe developed with the SEA. The joint plan must be approved by both theLEA and SEA before the plan may be implemented. The Secretary believesthat the SEA may withhold approval of the LEA's application if the planis not approved by both parties. The Secretary is aware that this interpretationgives significant authority to the SEA. However, the Secretary is concernedthat ineffective programs not be allowed to continue, and believes thatthe timelines provide sufficient latitude for the LEA and SEA to agreeon the necessary program modifications. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments were received on the local conditionsin andSection; 200.38(c). Two commenters supported the provision in andSection;200.38(c)(2) that local conditions may be considered at any point in theprogram improvement process. Several commenters requested clarificationin the regulations that local conditions may not be used to justify settinglower standards for program quality or to excuse an LEA or SEA from itsprogram improvement responsibilities. Other commenters requested expandingthe list of local conditions to include ``establishing a timeline for implementingeach school's plan'' and ``strikes, job actions, court orders or otherredistricting of school attendance zones, major accidents, natural disasters,epidemics, or health emergencies.'' <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(e) of the Act requires an LES and SEA,in performing their program improvement responsibilities, to take intoconsideration five special local conditions. As written in the statute,those conditions are an inclusive list. Thus, the final regulations cannotexpand the list to include other local conditions. Local conditions arenot meant to excuse an LEA or SEA from fulfilling their program improvementresponsibilities or to justify setting low standards. Rather, in designingprojects and allocation funds to schools, LEAs should take these factorsinto consideration. When these factors cannot be determined beforehand,they may become legitimate mitigating factors that may affect, for example,how substantial progress toward meeting desired outcomes will be measuredand whether certain schools are identified as needing program improvement.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters expressed concern regarding the potentialpaperwork and reporting burden created by the student program improvementrequirements in andSection; 200.38(d), particularly if the information mustbe reported to the SEA. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(f) of the Act requires each LEA to: (1)Identify students who have been served for a year and have not met thestandards in section 1021(b); (2) consider modifications in the programto better serve those students; and (3) conduct a thorough assessment ofthe educational needs of students who remain in the program after two consecutiveyears and have not met the standards in section 1021(b). Section 200.38(d)of the final regulations essentially implements these statutory requirements.Nothing in the statute or regulations, however, requires an LEA to submitthe data it collects on individual students to the SEA. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether student progress had to bemeasured on an individual or aggregate basis. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Under section 1021(f) of the Act, and LEA must measurestudent progress on an individual basis. Otherwise, this requirement wouldbe no different from measuring the progress of students in a school, whichis the basis for school program improvement under section 1021(b) of theAct. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether an LEA must evaluate specificsubject areas in assessing student improvement need, noting that such assessmentcould involve considerable burden for the LEA. <T3>Discussion: </T3>An LEA must assess student improvement needs on thesame basis as the LEA assesses school improvement needs. Thus, the LEAmust assess a student's performance in the primary area in which the studentis receiving instruction, unless the student is receiving relatively equalamounts of instruction in two more areas. In those cases, the LEA mustassess progress in each area. In addition, the LEA must assess progresstoward any desired outcomes the LEA has established. If these concern specificsubject areas, then the LEA would have to assess student improvement inthose areas too. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that an LEA be required to consultwith parents in conducting student program improvement efforts. The commenerwished to ensure that parents be directly involved in the process.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.38(a)(1)(ii) of the final regulationsrequires an LEA to make the results of its annual review under andSection;200.38(a), which identifies students in need of program improvement, availableto parents. In addition, andSection; 200.34(a) requires an LEA to implementprograms, activities, and procedures for involving parents, including obtainingparent input in the planning, design, and implementation of the Chapter1 LEA Program. That section also requires that the activities and proceduresmust be planned and implemented with meaningful consultation with parentsof participating children. These sections, therefore, already provide formeaningful consultation with parents in an LEA's student improvement efforts.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters questioned the definition of a ``thoroughassessment'' of educational needs in andSection; 200.38(d)(3), suggestingthat the assessment be easy and not burdensome. If the thorough assessmentshows no improvement or a decline in a child's achievement, one commentersuggested that the regulations require the LEA to modify the child's program.Another commenter requested that the regulations make clear that an LEAis not required to develop an individual educational plan for each child.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1021(f)(3) of the Act requires an LEA to conducta ``thorough assessment'' of the educational needs of students who remainin the program after two consecutive years of participation and have notmet the standards in section 1021(b). This assessment must be sufficientto determine what the specific educational needs of the students are. Oncethe assessment is completed, andSection; 200.38(d)(3) of the final regulationsrequires an LEA, if appropriate, to use the results of the needs assessmentto modify the Chapter 1 project to meet the student's needs. The LEA, however,is not required to develop an individual educational plan for each student.The Secretary feels such a requirement goes beyond the intent of the statuteand would place undue burden on LEAs. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that andSection; 200.38 makeclear that program improvement requirements apply to services for privateschool children, including those provided by a bypass contractor. The commenterwas concerned that the term ``school program improvement'' might be interpretedto mean public schools only. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Program and student improvement requirements in section1021 of the Act apply to all children, public and private, participatingin Chapter 1 projects. Section 200.38(e) of the final regulations makesclear that these requirements apply to the services provided to privateschool children. The requirements are also applicable to bypass contractors.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the requirement in andSection;200.38(f) that LEAs begin to identify schools and students in need of programimprovement on the basis of data gathered before or during the 1988-89school year because section 1491(c) of the Act provides that the 1988-89school year is a transition year in which the provisions of either thenew Act or Chapter 1 of ECIA may be followed. Another commenter questionedwhat data should be used for program improvement purposes if the requireddata are not available by the end of the 1988-89 school year. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Because the program improvement requirements are thecenterpiece of the new Act, the Secretary is interested in implementingthose requirements as soon as possible in order that schools and studentsin need of program improvement are identified and begin to receive assistance.In addition, the Secretary believes that the correct interpretation ofthe transition year provision means that, if they desired to do so, LEAscould have implemented program improvement activities during 1988-89_notthat these required activities could be delayed for one year beyond thedate on which the provision comes into effect. The Secretary is aware thatLEAs have not established desired outcomes for the 1988-89 school yearand may not be testing on an annual basis. Thus, for the first year LEAswill have to measure aggregate performance under andSection; 200.38(b)(1)(ii)and student achievement under andSection; 200.38(d)(1)(ii) based on the bestdata the LEAs have available. Section 200.39 How May Personnel be Assigned Non-Chapter 1 Duties? <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested that the reference to homeroomsupervision as an allowable supervisory duty be removed. The commentersobjected to its inclusion because they believe it is not a supervisoryduty; it supplants the LEA's responsibility; and it takes time away fromneeded Chapter 1 activities. Others requested deletion of the entire listingof activities, noting that Chapter 1 teachers need more time to implementthe Chapter 1 program, that the LEA basic program will be supplanted bythe Chapter 1 program, and that Chapter 1 teachers have more responsibilitiesthan district teachers and there is insufficient time to do what is essential.One commenter questioned whether curriculum activities are supervisory.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Nothing in andSection; 200.39 requires an LEA to assignChapter 1 teachers non-Chapter 1 duties. Rather, andSection; 200.39 provideslimited authority to do so, if the LEA considers those duties to be appropriate.The duties must be duties that are also assigned to similarly situatedpersonnel and may not exceed the time limits specified in andSection; 200.39(a)(2).Section 1453(a) of the Act makes clear that non-Chapter 1 duties need notbe limited to classroom instruction. The House Report accompanying theAct makes specific reference to homeroom supervision and curriculum committeesas activities that may be allowed under this provision. H.R. Rept. 95,100th Cong., 1st Sess. 35 (1987). Based on the expanded examples in thislegislative history, the Secretary believes that the term ``supervisory''in the Act must be interpreted more broadly than the meaning of the termwhen referring to lunchroom, hall, and playground supervision. That is,the supervision may include duties that do not require the direct supervisionof children. The Secretary believes that assignments of Chapter 1 teachersto curriculum committees, for example, are ``supervisory'' in that theteacher are in effect involved in decisions concerning instructional programsand materials. <T3>Changes: </T3>Although no change has been made to the content, thetitle has been revised to refer to``non-Chapter 1'' duties rather thansupervisory duties. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked whether supervisory duties includeusing aides as substitute teachers, because that use would replace localresponsibility in that area. <T3>Discussion: </T3>There is nothing in the statute or the regulationsto prohibit the assignment of personnel paid entirely with Chapter 1 fundsto substitute teaching duties. However, this can only be done within theallowed proportion of time as required in andSection; 200.39(b)(2), and ifsimilarly situated non-Chapter 1 personnel at the same school site arealso assigned to substitute teaching duties.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned if Chapter 1 aides could performsupervisory duties if the only aides the district employed were paid withChapter 1 funds. The commenter noted that, in this instance, there areno similarly situated personnel with whom Chapter 1 aides may be compared.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.39(a) requires that similarly situatedpersonnel at the same school site, who are not paid with Chapter 1 funds,must also be assigned the duties. If the LEA does not employ non-Chapter1 aides, the LEA should determine if there are other similarly situatedpersonnel at the site who are assigned the supervisory duties in orderto assign those duties to the Chapter 1 aides. If no such persons exist,Chapter 1 aides may not be used to perform non-Chapter 1 duties.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested an explicit definition of thelimitations associated with non-Chapter 1 duties. The commenter was concernedthat, absent certain limitations, Chapter 1 personnel might be asked toperform any duty at all.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The limitations are included in andSection; 200.39(a)of the regulations. In revising Chapter 1, Congress made clear its intentionto provide LEAs with more flexibility with regard to the use of Chapter1-paid personnel to perform, in a limited manner, non-Chapter 1 activities.H.R. Rept. 95, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 34 (1987). The regulations reflectthat intent.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters expressed a concern regarding the timeallowed to perform non-Chapter 1 duties. One opposed the 60-minute limitationbecause of the conflict that would occur at a school site where non-Chapter1 staff members are expected to work at supervisory duties for more than60 minutes per day on a schedule that applies to all teachers in the building.The other suggested that one period per day be defined as 60 minutes perday, if appropriate, because of the possibility of a period varying from35-55 minutes within a district depending on the instructional approachused.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1453(a) of the Act limits the amount of timea Chapter 1-paid staff member can be assigned to non-Chapter 1 duties tonot more than either the amount of time similarly situated personnel atthe same site are assigned or one period. Although periods in secondaryschools are fairly uniform within a school, elementary school periods varyby class and subject. Therefore, the Secretary has established 60 minutesas the maximum per day for non-Chapter 1 duties. However, the proportionof time may not exceed the least of the three criteria in andSection; 200.39(a)(2).<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested deletion of the language permittingweekly, monthly, and annual calculations so that time spent on non-Chapter1 duties is not accumulated but rather performed on a regular daily basis.The commenter was concerned that, if it is accumulated, Chapter 1 personnelcould be made to perform non-Chapter 1 duties exclusively for a periodof time. Another commenter requested deletion of the language permittingannual calculations since there is no specific rationale for it. Anothercommenter suggested the regulations provide for daily calculation of timefor some duties, such as study hall supervision, and limit weekly, monthly,or annual calculations to such activities as services on curriculum committees.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1453(a)(1) of the Act refers to ``the sameproportion of total work time as prevails with respect to similarly situatedpersonnel at the same school site.'' In order to allow maximum flexibilityto the LEA, the Secretary believes that calculating total work time usingvarious periods of time_daily, weekly, monthly, annually_within the totalschool year is appropriate.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulations should clarifyhow andSection; 200.39 applies to part-time personnel fully paid with Chapter1 funds. The commenter noted that, absent the clarification, a person paidwith Chapter 1 funds could be employed for two hours per day, one hourof which was spent supervising the lunchroom, if locally funded aides,who were full-time employees, were so used. The commenter was concernedthat, in this instance, Chapter 1-paid staff members would be spendingsignificant portions of their time performing non-Chapter 1 duties.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1453(a) of the Act and andSection; 200.39(a)(2)refer primarily to full-time employees, and make specific reference tosimilarly situated personnel. If an LEA employs part-time Chapter 1 persons,these persons may only be assigned non-Chapter 1 duties on a basis thatis proportionate to the time that similarly situated full-time personnelare assigned the same duties.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.41 What Maintenance of Effort Requirements Apply to This Program?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned the example following andSection;200.41(b) concerning an LEA's failure to maintain effort. The commenterinterpreted the example as comparing the same two years to compute maintenanceof effort for the year following an LEA's failure to maintain effort aswere compared in the year the LEA actually failed to maintain effort.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The example in andSection; 200.41(b) has a definitelimited purpose: to demonstrate how to calculate effort for the ``secondpreceding fiscal year'' in determining whether an LEA maintained effortin the year following a failure to maintain effort. The example is necessarybecause the ``second preceding fiscal year'' is the year the LEA failedto maintain effort and, therefore, the LEA's actual expenditures cannotbe used. As a result, the example instructs the SEA to use 90 percent ofthe ``third preceding fiscal year.'' Once the SEA follows the example toarrive at a figure for the ``second preceding fiscal year,'' the SEA mustthen compare expenditures from the ``first preceding fiscal year'' to determineif the LEA actually maintained effort in the year following the LEA's failureto maintain effort. Thus, the SEA must take an additional step after itfollows the example.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that andSection; 200.41(a)(1)be revised to indicate that the SEA shall allocate funds rather than payfunds to an LEA because SEAs pay LEAs after funds are expended on an approvedproject.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that the requirement should referto the State providing an LEA its full allocation, rather than paymentof funds.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.41(a)(1) has been revised to state that anLEA may receive its full allocation of Chapter 1 funds, if it meets themaintenance of effort requirement.Section 200.43 What Comparability of Services Requirements Apply to ThisProgram?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulations be no morerestrictive than the statute and provide flexibility that was previouslygiven to the SEAs and LEAs. The commenter also requested that the word``shall'' in andSection; 200.43(c)(1) be changed to ``may.'' Several commentersopposed this section because it requires excessive transmission of paperworkfrom the LEA to SEA. One commenter requested a definition of ``writtenprocedures.'' Another commenter suggested that SEAs be given the optionof determining comparability of services on the basis of an instructionalstaff-to-pupil ratio or on the basis of an instructional staff salary-to-pupilratio, as was formerly allowed, rather than restricting determinationsto the conditions contained in andSection; 200.43(c)(1).<T3>Discussion:</T3> On further review, the Secretary agrees that the proposedregulations appeared to place more restrictions and requirements on theLEA than the Act. In particular, section 1018(c)(2) sets out one meansto demonstrate comparability, but does not require that this method beused.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.43(c)(1) has been modified and expanded toallow the LEA to submit an assurance to the SEA that it has carried outthe requirements contained in section 1018(c)(2)(A) of the Act or providesthe LEA with other options for demonstrating comparability.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulations clarifythat the amount to be withheld or repaid by an LEA for failing to meetthe comparability requirements be the amount by which the LEA failed tocomply at the school site that was not comparable.<T3>Discussion:</T3> This provision is included in andSection; 200.43(e)(2)of the regulations.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested alternatives for an LEAto use when demonstrating comparability, including permitting the LEA touse grouping, clustering, or pairing of schools or attendance areas. Anothercommenter recommended that schools with fewer than 100 children be exemptedfrom the requirement.<T3>Discussion:</T3> In the past, Chapter 1 has permitted a number of alternativemethods for determining comparability. Specific examples of alternativeswill be included in the policy manual.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.44 What Supplement, Not Supplant Requirement Applies to ThisProgram?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that additional regulationsbe developed to assist in preventing future audit exceptions to assistSEAs and LEAs in meeting the requirements of this section. The commenterwas concerned that, absent specific regulations, SEAs and LEAs might interpretstatutory provisions in a manner different than that of auditors. Anothercommenter recommended including a list of examples of in-class and whole-classteaching methods to provide additional guidance in this area.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary is sensitive to the concern for additionalregulation is this area; however, balanced against the need to provideState and local flexibility, he does not believe additional regulationis justified. However, to provide guidance, the Department will includein the policy manual specific examples of delivery systems that are incompliance with the supplement, not supplant requirements.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.46 What Is The Maximum Amount of Funds an LEA May Carryover?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that if an LEA is bypassed withrespect to the requirement to serve children enrolled in private schools,the LEA be exempted from the limitations on carryover funds. The commenternoted that funds withheld from the LEA to implement a bypass that are notexpended by the contractor may be returned too late for the LEA to expendin a timely manner, resulting in the LEA's exceeding the carryover limitationthrough no fault of its own.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that unexpended funds from anamount withheld from an LEA to implement a bypass that are subsequentlymade available to the LEA are not to be included when determining limitationson carryover amounts.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.50 What Are an LEA's Responsibilities for Providing Chapter1 Services to Children in Private Schools?<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether all of the guidancethe Department has issued on <T3>Aguilar</T3> v. <T3>Felton</T3> is included in the regulations.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The regulations do not contain all of the Department'sguidance concerning implementation of the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Aguilar</T3> v. <T3>Felton</T3>. The Secretary intends to include the guidance not incorporatedinto this regulation in the Chapter 1 policy manual.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that the complaint provisionsin andSection; 200.50(b) be modified to require initial contact with theLEA and early involvement by the SEA. One of the commenters suggested thata complainant be required to exhaust the complaint procedures in andSection;200.72 of the proposed regulations before filing a complaint with the Secretary.Commenters were concerned that bypassing local efforts to resolve complaintswould result in too many complaints being raised to the Department, someof which may have been resolved by the LEA or SEA.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1017(b)(3)(A) of the Act authorizes parents,teachers, or other concerned organizations or individuals to file complaintswith the Secretary if they believe the requirements for providing Chapter1 services to private school children have been violated. Under this section,the Secretary must investigate and resolve each complaint within 120 days.According to the legislative history accompanying this section, the mandatorytime limit was included to ``insure that educationally deprived childrenin private schools do not go without needed services for long periods oftime.'' H.R. Rept. 95, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 30 (1987). Therefore, theSecretary believes that requiring a complainant to exhaust the State andlocal complaint procedures required under andSection;andSection; 200.73 through200.75 before filing with the Secretary would abrogate the purpose forspeedy resolution behind the 120-day requirement. Moreover, because section1017 authorizes a complainant to file directly with the Secretary, it wouldbe inappropriate for the Secretary to require the complainant to file firstwith the LEA or SEA. From a practical standpoint, however, the Secretaryencourages a complainant to attempt to resolve the concerns at the localand State levels before complaining to the Secretary. Moreover, the Secretarywill first look to the State and local levels for information in resolvingthe complaint.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 200.51 What are the Requirements for Consultation With PrivateSchool Officials? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned with what level of private schoolofficial an LEA is required to consult? <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1017(a) of the Act requires an LEA to consultwith ``appropriate private school officials.'' The level of the officialwith whom an LEA must consult will vary depending upon the organizationof the private school. However, it must be an individual who can adequatelyrepresent the needs of the private school children. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.52 What Factors Does an LEA Use in Determining Equitable Participation?<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters questioned whether, particularly in implementingalternative delivery systems after <T3>Aguilar </T3>v. <T3>Felton</T3>, an LEA may spend less than equal amounts on services forprivate school children if private school officials agree to accept thoseservices. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Under section 1017(a) of the Act, eligible privateschool children must receive services that are equitable in comparisonto the Chapter 1 services provided to public school children in terms ofboth the quality and the costs of the services. When both public and privateschool children are receiving the same services, the equitability requirementis easily met. However, in providing Chapter 1 services to private schoolchildren through alternative delivery systems such as computer-assistedinstruction (CAI), the question of equitability is more difficult. Thismay be especially true in a year after computers are purchased because,after the initial purchase of equipment, CAI normally provides servicesat a cost less than the typical Chapter 1 program. Whether the servicesprovided by an LEA to private school children are equitable to those providedto public school children is measured by the factors in andSection; 200.52(b)(2).If CAI alone, for example, does not provide this equity, the LEA may makeup the difference by offering additional services, such as tutorial centersor appropriate summer school programs. Of course, private school childrenmay decide to participate in only a portion of the services offered, andthe offer may still be considered equitable. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters requested deletion of the provision in andSection;200.52(a)(2) that requires an LEA to pay for reasonable and necessary administrativecosts of providing services to public and private school children, includingcapital expenses, from the LEA's whole allocation of Chapter 1 funds beforethe LEA determines equal expenditures. Some commenters objected specificallyto capital expenses being included as administrative costs that are taken``off the top'' of the LEA's allocation. Commenters believed these costsshould be included in determining if the requirement that expendituresper pupil for services to private school children be equal to those forchildren attending public schools has been met. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1017 of the Act requires that an LEA provideprivate school children with special educational services as will ensurethose children's participation on an equitable basis with children in publicschools. Expenditures for those educational services to private schoolchildren must be equal (taking into account the number and needs of theprivate school children) to expenditures for public school children. Particularlysince <T3>Aguilar </T3>v. <T3>Felton</T3>, the administrative costs of providing educational servicesto private school children have become greater than the costs of providingsuch services to public school children. If these costs were deducted solelyfrom the portion of the LEA's Chapter 1 funds designated to provide servicesto private school children, the remaining funds would not be sufficientto provide equitable instructional services to those children, thus defeatingthe purpose of the statutory provision. Therefore, in order to ensure thatequitable services are provided to both public and private school children,the administrative costs are to be ``off the top'' of the LEA's allocation.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters requested clarification of the provision inandSection; 200.52(b)(2)(i) that requires an LEA to assess, address, andevaluate the specific needs and educational progress of eligible privateschool children ``on the same basis as public school children.'' Commentersalleged that some LEAs do not assess the needs and progress of privateschool children. Moreover, commenters urged that if private school childrenhave different needs, they should receive different services. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Public and private school children participate inthe same, not a different, Chapter 1 project. To design a project properly,an LEA must, under section 1014(b) of the Act, identify educationally deprivedchildren in all eligible school attendance areas, including educationallydeprived children in private schools. Based on the information obtained,including the information on private school children, the LEA must determinethe grade levels and instructional areas on which its Chapter 1 projectwill concentrate. Within the basic framework, the LEA may vary the instructionalareas and grade levels among school attendance areas if the needs assessmentdata support those differences. For example, if the LEA's needs assessmentidentifies, in general, the greatest needs in reading in grades 1-3, butseveral schools have greater needs in grades 4-6, the LEA may vary thegrade levels it serves to meet those different needs. Similarly, needsmay also vary within an attendance area. For instance, while reading maybe the greatest general instructional area of need, mathematics may bea greater need in one or more grades within the attendance area. Such differencesin needs may also occur with respect to eligible private school children.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.31(b)(2) has been revised to clarify thatan LEA must identify the general instructional areas and grade levels onwhich the program will focus on the basis of information on needs gatheredby identifying all educationally deprived children, including those childrenin private schools. As that section indicates, instructional areas andgrade levels may vary among and within school attendance areas if the needsassessment data support differing needs. Section 200.55 May Funds be Used for Construction of Private School Facilities?<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters recommended specifically excluding costsfor security and utility installations, electrical outlets and wiring,dedicated telephone lines, etc., associated with providing Chapter 1 CAIin private schools from andSection; 200.55, which prohibits the use of Chapter1 funds for repairs, minor remodeling, or construction of private schoolfacilities. Commenters felt that, absent the exclusion, LEAs would be reluctantto pay these costs. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department stated in its guidance on implementing<T3>Aguilar </T3>v. <T3>Felton </T3>that reasonable installation costs of providing Chapter1 CAI are allowable under certain circumstances. For example, installationwould be permissible if the installation is necessary for the Chapter 1program to operate; the cost is related solely to the Chapter 1 programand does not otherwise correct a deficiency in the private school facility;the installation does not result in any improvement to the private schoolfacility other than the electrical wiring related to Chapter 1 computers;and the representatives of the private school agree either to reimbursethe Chapter 1 program for the residual value of the wiring (the installationcost minus depreciation) or to have the LEA remove the wiring if the CAIprogram is terminated at the site. The Secretary intends to include thisguidance in the Chapter 1 policy manual. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Section 200.57 How Does an LEA Receive a Payment for Capital Expenses?<T3>Comment:</T3> A number of comments were received on the definitionof capital expenses in andSection; 200.57(a)(2). Some commenters requestedexpansion of the definition, particularly to include instructional equipmentsuch as computers. One commenter interpreted andSection; 200.57(a)(2)(ii)as prohibiting the purchase of computers to provide instruction to privateschool children. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Under section 1017(d)(4) of the Act, capital expensesare limited to expenditures for noninstructional goods and services thatare incurred as a result of implementation of alternative delivery systemsto comply with the requirements of<T3> Aguilar</T3> v.<T3> Felton.</T3> Section 1017(d)(4) sets out examples of such noninstructionalgoods and services, such as purchase, lease, and rental of real and personalproperty, insurance and maintenance costs, and transportation costs. Section200.57(a)(2)(i) lists the statutory examples. Section 200.57(a)(2)(ii)specifically excludes from the definition of capital expenses instructionalequipment such as computers, because it does not fall within the statutorymeaning of noninstructional goods and services. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether an LEA may establisha date later than July 1, 1985 for capital expense purposes if the LEAdid not incur capital expenses until that later date. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1017(d)(3) establishes July 1, 1985_the dateof the Supreme Court's decision in<T3> Aguilar</T3> v.<T3> Felton</T3>_as the relevant date for capital expense purposes. Accordingly,an LEA may not receive payment for any capital expenses incurred beforethis date. However, an LEA may receive payment for capital expenses incurredany time_even several years_after this date <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked what would happen if an LEA appliedfor a payment for capital expenses on the basis of an expected increasein the number of private school children and the expected increase didnot materialize. The commenter was concerned that the LEA might be requiredto repay those funds. Another commenter recommended that an LEA documentits expected increases to ensure capital expense funds will be well spent.<T3>Discussion:</T3> One of the criteria an SEA may use to make paymentsto LEAs for capital expenses is the extent to which those payments wouldbe used to increase the number or percentage of private school childrenserved. Therefore, an LEA that applies for payments on this basis shouldhave information to support a reasonable expectation that, with paymentsfor capital expenses, the LEA could increase the number or percentage ofprivate school children served. However, if the LEA has such information,but the anticipated numbers or percentages of private school children donot materialize, the LEA would not be required to repay the capital expensepayments. <T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.57(b)(5) has been added to require in anLEA's application for payments for capital expenses information sufficientto support anticipated increases in the number or percentage of privateschool children to be served, if the LEA is applying on that basis. <T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters commented on the criteria fordetermining need for capital expense payments in andSection; 200.57(c). Onecommenter recommended that each LEA be allowed to determine the numberor percentage of private school children to be served and requested deletingthe SEA's authority to establish criteria. Another commenter suggestedthat the criteria in the regulations be deleted and that SEAs establishneeds and priorities for distribution. Other commenters recommended thatthe criteria clearly give priority for the distribution of payments forcapital expenses to LEAs to increase the number or percentage of privateschool children being served to pre-<T3>Felton</T3> levels, since the commenter felt that increasing participationis more important than repaying LEAs for costs already incurred. Stillother commenters supported the flexibility to reimburse LEAs that had takencapital expenses ``off-the-top'' of their Chapter 1 allocations. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1017(d)(1) of the Act requires each SEA todistribute the funds allocated to it for payments for capital expensesto its LEAs ``based on the degree of need as set forth in the application.''To determine LEAs' needs for capital expense payments, an SEA must establishcriteria. Section 200.57(c) sets out examples of criteria an SEA may use.The regulations do not require an SEA to use any particular criterion orto give priority to LEAs that will use capital expense payments to increasethe number or percentage of private school children being served to pre-<T3>Felton</T3> levels. Rather, each SEA has the flexibility to establishits own criteria based on the circumstances in its State. The criteriain this section in no way affect an LEA's decisions regarding the numberor percentage of private school children it will serve with Chapter 1 funds.<T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.58 How Does an LEA Use Payments for Capital Expenses? <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters questioned how payments for capitalexpenses may be used. One commenter questioned whether a payment reimbursingan LEA for capital expenses could be used to purchase a van. Other commentersquestioned whether an LEA could use those payments to provide servicesto both public and private school children. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Payments under section 1017(d) of the Act may be madeto reimburse an LEA for capital expenses it paid for from its regular Chapter1 allocation or to pay for capital expenses an LEA is incurring or willincur in the future. If the payments are for reimbursement, they must beused to provide Chapter 1 services to benefit, to the extent possible,the public and private school children who were or are adversely affectedby the LEA's s expenditures for capital expenses. In other words, if theLEA paid for capital expenses ``off-the-top'' of its total Chapter 1 allocation,it would use its payments for capital expenses to provide services to publicand private school children because both public and private school childrenwould have benefited from additional services had the LEA not used Chapter1 funds for capital expenses. If, for some reason, the LEA paid for capitalexpenses totally from the funds it set aside to provide services to privateschool children, the LEA would use its reimbursement for those capitalexpenses to provide additional services to private school children. AnLEA could not use a reimbursement for capital expenses to purchase a van,because reimbursements must be used for services that were lost due toprior costs of capital expenses. An LEA, of course, may use prospectivecapital expense funds to purchase a van. <T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.58(a)(1) has been revised to make clear thatpayments to reimburse an LEA for capital expenses it incurred are to beused, to the extent possible, to provide Chapter 1 services to benefitthe public and private school children who were adversely affected by theLEA's expenditures for capital expenses. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether the restrictions oncarryover funds in section 1432(b) of the Act apply to capital expenses.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1432(b) of the Act limits the amount of fundsappropriated for a given fiscal year that an LEA may carry over. Section200.46(a) interprets the phrase ``funds appropriated'' to be the basicgrant and concentration grant funds an LEA is eligible to receive in anygiven year. Therefore, andSection; 200.46(a) does not apply to capital expenses.<T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether an LEA must track separatelyfunds received for capital expenses, noting this would increase paperworkfor the LEA. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Because capital expenses are awarded as a separategrant for special purposes, they must be accounted for separately. <T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.58(c) has been added to indicate that anLEA must account separately for payments it receives for capital expenses.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned whether an LEA that was unableto provide services to children who were adversely affected in 1984-85and subsequent years could use the capital expense funds. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.58(a)(1) requires that capital expensefunds be used to benefit, to the extent possible, the children adverselyaffected by the LEA's expenditures for capital expenses. The intent ofthe provision is to recognize that there will be circumstances where thesame children cannot benefit from the funds. Under those circumstances,the funds may be used to benefit similar groups of children. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.70 Does a State Have Authority to Issue State Regulations forthe Chapter 1 LEA Program? <T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters raised questions concerning therelationship between an SEA's responsibility for administering the Chapter1 LEA Program and the limitations on the SEA's rulemaking authority inandSection; 200.70(b). One commenter questioned whether an SEA could limitthe percentage of an LEA's budget to be used to purchase supplies, materials,or other categories of expenditures. Two commenters recommended insertingin the stem in andSection; 200.70(b) the phrase ``that limit LEAs' decisionsbased upon their annual assessment of need affecting funds under this part.''On the other hand, several commenters recommended that the regulationsclarify that an SEA has the authority to ensure that its LEAs use Chapter1 funds in accordance with all applicable requirements. <T3>Discussion: </T3>LEAs are authorized to use Chapter 1 funds to supportactivities, described in approved applications, that are reasonable andnecessary to carry out the purposes of the Chapter 1 LEA Program. An SEAdoes not have the authority to impose rigid limitations on reasonable expendituresneeded by an LEA to implement an effective program if those expendituresare supported by the LEA's assessment of the special educational needsof Chapter 1 children. However, an SEA has the responsibility under section1012(b) of the Act to review and approve LEA applications and the responsibilityunder section 1012(a)(4) to ensure that LEAs comply with all applicablestatutory and regulatory provisions. Thus, as andSection; 200.70(c)(2) indicates,an SEA may review the proposed expenditures in an LEA's application todetermine that they are supported by the LEA's needs assessment. Moreover,andSection; 200.70(c)(3) makes clear that an SEA has the responsibility toreview LEA decisions concerning the use of Chapter 1 funds to ensure thatthey comply with applicable requirements. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.70(c)(2) has been revised to make clear thatnothing in andSection; 200.70(b) limits an SEA's authority to review andapprove an LEA's application, including determining whether the activitiesin the application are supported by the LEA's needs assessment. Similarly,andSection; 200.70(c)(3) reiterates an SEA's responsibility to ensure compliancewith applicable requirements. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters requested that the reference to instructionalstaff in andSection; 200.70(b)(4) be clarified to include instructional aides.Another commenter interpreted ``other essential support services'' in andSection;200.70(b)(5) to include services provided by paraprofessionals such asteacher aides. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the definitions of instructionalstaff and support services are best established by LEAs under applicableState laws or regulations. In accordance with section 1451(a)(2) of theAct, however, instructional staff must meet State certification and licensingrequirements for education personnel. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous comments were received on andSection; 200.70(e)regarding review of rules and regulations by the committee of practitioners.A number of commenters recommended that an SEA be required, rather thanencouraged, to convene the committee of practitioners. These commentersfelt that to require convening for an emergency regulation, while not doingso in normal circumstances, was inconsistent. Other commenters requestedthat the regulations make clear that the committee must review any ruleor regulation. Several commenters recommended that the committee also berequired to review State policies. These commenters noted that the terms``rule'' and ``regulation'' may have differing meanings, and that someStates issue binding requirements under other procedures. These commentersfelt that the intent of the Act was to cover all these circumstances. Somecommenters recommended deletion of the phrase ``if one is required by Statelaw'' in andSection; 200.70(e)(1)(i)(A) of the proposed regulations, becauseit is confusing. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1451(b) of the Act requires review by a Statecommittee of practitioners ``(b)efore publication of any proposed or finalState rule or regulation.'' The proposed regulations attempted to minimizeany burden caused by this provision by only requiring review by the committeeof practitioners before publication of either a proposed rule, if Statelaw required issuance of proposed rules, or a final rule, if no proposedrule was required. Moreover, the proposed regulations did not require anSEA to convene the committee except after the issuance of an emergencyrule where review prior to publication was not possible. On the basis ofthese comments and upon reconsideration, the Secretary believes changesare necessary. The Secretary recognizes the inconsistency in requiringa State to convene the committee to review emergency rules and regulationswhile not requiring that the committee be convened to review other regulations.However, the Secretary is concerned with the undue burden that will beplaced on States if the committee must be convened to review all rulesand regulations. Although the negotiated rulemaking group did not reachconsensus on the Department's proposal to convene the committee for majorrules and regulations, the Secretary believes that this interpretationrepresents the most viable means to carry out the intent of the Act. Therefore,a State will be required to convene the committee to review all major rulesand regulations and ensure that all other rules and regulations be reviewedbefore publication by the committee but not necessarily in a meeting. Inaddition, in a State that does not issue rules or regulations relatingto the administration and operation of programs under this part but issuespolicies that the SEA and LEAs are required to follow, the State must complywith the consultation requirements for issuing rules and regulations. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.70(e) has been revised to require a Stateto convene the committee of practitioners to review any major proposedor final rule or regulation that the SEA and LEAs are required to followin administering and implementing the Chapter 1 LEA Program. In addition,a change has been made to require that, for a State that does not issuerules or regulations but only issues policies that LEAs must follow, theState must comply with the consultation requirements for issuing rulesand regulations. <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous commenters requested that the regulations require,rather than encourage, SEAs to obtain nominations for membership on thecommittee of practitioners from appropriate organizations. These commentersthought this procedure would ensure that the committee was representativeof the various groups named in the Act. One commenter was concerned thatthere would be a conflict of interest with members nominated by organizationssince nominating organizations would be partially responsible for thatindividual's selection. Another commenter questioned whether an existingState committee, such as the Chapter 2 State Advisory Committee, couldserve as the Chapter 1 committee of practitioners <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1451(b) of the Act specifies the categoriesof individuals that must be included on the committee of practitionersand requires that a majority of committee members be LEA representatives.The Secretary believes it is inappropriate for the Department to regulatehow a State meets this requirement. He continues to encourage SEAs to requestnominations from appropriate organizations as an excellent way to obtainqualified representatives. If an existing State committee meets the requirementsof the Act, the SEA may decide to have it serve for this purpose. However,as andSection; 200.70(e)(3)(iii) indicates, members of the committee musthave knowledge of Chapter 1 and how it is implemented. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.70(e)(3)(iii) has been added to require thatmembers of the committee of practitioners have knowledge of Chapter 1.<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters recommended deletion of andSection; 200.70(e)(3)(i)(E),which requires that the committee of practitioners include representativesof private school children. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1017 of the Act requires an LEA, after timelyand meaningful consultation with appropriate private school officials,to provide equitable Chapter 1 services to eligible private school children.Given this requirement, it is appropriate that private school representativesbe included on the committee of practitioners to advise on rules, regulations,and policies affecting the Chapter 1 LEA Program. In addition, the requirementwas agreed to by all parties during the negotiated rulemaking session.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.71 How May State Personnel Paid With Funds Available UnderThis Part be Assigned to State Programs? <T3>Comment: </T3>Although supporting the provisions in andSection; 200.71,a number of commenters questioned the requirement to keep time distributionrecords if SEA staff members perform duties that benefit both programsunder this part and State compensatory education programs that are similarto the Chapter 1 program. The commenters contended that it is not possiblefor the staff members to divide their time between the two programs becausetheir duties benefit both programs and cannot be distinguished.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.71 implements section 1453(b) of the Act which authorizes an SEA to use Chapter 1 funds to pay a portion of thesalary costs of employees who are assigned responsibilities for programsunder this part and specific State programs if those costs are supportedby appropriate time distribution records reflecting the actual amount oftime spent by each such employee and costs are charged on a prorated basisto both programs. Under most circumstances, employees who work on bothChapter 1 and State programs perform duties that are specific to one programor the other and can attribute their time to the appropriate program. Inthese instances, the employees must, in accordance with andSection; 200.71(b),keep contemporaneous time distribution records reflecting the actual amountof time spent on each program. However, there may be situations where anemployee is assigned responsibilities that jointly benefit a State programand programs under this part. For example, an SEA staff member may conducttraining sessions for LEAs on improving parent participation in both theChapter 1 and State programs. Both State-funded personnel and Chapter 1-fundedpersonnel receive the training. The employee cannot determine the actualtime spent for each program because parent involvement is a requirementof both programs Thus, the costs to be charged to each program cannot bebased on the actual time spent on each program. The Secretary concurs that,under these circumstances, another method may be allowable. For example,the costs could be prorated between the programs on the basis of the proportionsof staff from each funding source participating in the training. <T3>Changes:</T3> Section 200.71(c) has been added to clarify that, foremployees who are assigned responsibilities that jointly benefit programsunder this part and special State programs, costs may be prorated on abasis other than actual time spent on specific activities. The regulationsalso provide an example for further clarification. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters questioned whether, in addition to timedistribution records, there are other acceptable types of documentation,e.g., a teacher's schedule, to support an individual's time spent on Chapter1 activities. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1453(b) of the Act requires that an employeemaintain ``time distribution records reflecting the actual amount of timespent'' by the employee on Chapter 1 activities. The Secretary believesthat a teacher's class schedule specifying the time that the teacher devotesto Chapter 1 activities meets this requirement as long as there is corroboratingevidence that the teacher actually carried out the schedule. Examples ofacceptable evidence include a teacher's grade book and class rosters anddaily attendance records that identify the teacher. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.72 What Funds Are Available for an SEA to Carry Out Its Responsibilities?<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested that the regulations clarifywhether an SEA may use the funds made available under section 1405 of theAct (Funds for the Implementation of School Improvement Programs) to hirestaff for program improvement activities. Other commenters recommendedthat the regulations provide flexibility for SEAs in the use of these funds.Specifically, the commenters suggested that the funds need to be availablefor SEA program improvement staff purposes as determined by the SEA andnot be dependent on the identification of all schools needing program improvementand the joint agreement by those schools in the use of the funds. Anothercommenter suggested that there are not enough funds in section 1405 toprovide mini-grants to LEAs. Lastly, a commenter recommended that the regulationsallow an SEA to hire program improvement staff with State funds and reimbursethe State with funds received under section 1405 of the Act for any assistancethe staff members provide to a school implementing a program improvementplan under this part. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1405(b)(2) of the Act clearly states thatfunds made available to States under that section must be used for ``directeducational services in schools implementing program improvement plansas described under section 1021'' of the Act. Moreover, section 1405(b)(3)of the Act clearly requires parents of participating children, school staff,the LEA, and the SEA to jointly agree to the selection of technical assistanceproviders and the best use of the funds. Section 200.72(b) of the regulationsimplements these statutory requirements. Therefore, an SEA may use section1405 funds to hire State staff only if those staff provide direct educationalservices and if parents, school staffs, and the LEAs to receive servicesfor school improvement jointly agree with the SEA that hiring the Statestaff is the best use of the funds. As to the request that the regulations be revised to allow an SEA to useChapter 1 funds to reimburse the State for time that staff members paidwith State funds spend on program improvement activities, the Secretarybelieves that this violates section 1018(b) of the Act. Section 1018(b)requires that funds received under this part must supplement, and not supplantor replace, regular non-Federal funds. The Secretary believes, however,that it would be permissible for an SEA to use Chapter 1 administrativefunds to hire State staff and then use section 1405 funds to reimbursethe Chapter 1 account if the requisite agreement is reached. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.73 What Complaint Procedures Must an SEA Adopt? <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested that the complaint proceduresrequired by andSection; 200.72(d) of the proposed regulations should describethe means to be used to inform interested parties of the availability ofthe procedures. Commenters also recommended that the regulations include,in addition to procedures for resolving complaints that an LEA has violatedrequirements, similar procedures for resolving complaints about State violations.Lastly, commenters requested that the regulations specifically providean opportunity for a complainant to appeal an SEA's resolution of a complaintto the Department <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.72 of the proposed regulations containedrequirements concerning complaint procedures that each SEA would have toadopt. Those regulations were developed, in part, in response to Congress'suggestion in the Conference Report accompanying the Act that the Secretary``issue amended regulations making 34 CFR 76.780-783 applicable to Chapter1.'' <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rept. 567, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 341 (1978). However,subsequent to enactment of the Act but before the proposed Chapter 1 regulationswere published, the Secretary published an NPRM proposing changes to theEducation Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 31580 (Aug. 18, 1988). One of those proposed changeswas the removal of the general complaint procedures in 34 CFR 76.780 through76.782 of EDGAR and the transfer of those procedures to the regulationsimplementing Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, which hadshown the greatest need for the complaint procedures. As a result, theSecretary proposed separate Chapter l complaint procedures. In responseto comments on the EDGAR NPRM, the Secretary is reconsidering whether toremove the complaint procedures from EDGAR. Because this issue has notyet been resolved, the Secretary has on an interim basis decided to makethe general complaint procedures from EDGAR applicable to the Chapter 1LEA Program. For the convenience of SEAs, LEAs, and other interested parties,the procedures are included in andSection;andSection; 200.73 through 200.75.However, paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection; 76.780 are not included asthe statutory references are no longer appropriate. In addition, the acronyms``SEA'' and ``LEA'' replace the terms ``State'' and ``subgrantee'' to beconsistent with the remaining regulations under this part. In addition,section 200.73 of the regulations requires that an SEA's written proceduresfor resolving complaints include any complaint that the SEA or an LEA isin violation of the Federal statute or regulation that apply to a program.Section 200.74 of the regulations also requires that an SEA's complaintprocedures include the right to request the Secretary to review the finaldecision of the SEA. Comments received on the proposed Chapter 1 complaintprocedures will be given additional consideration in whatever final actionthe Secretary takes regarding the EDGAR complaint procedures.<T3>Changes:</T3> The separate Chapter 1 complaint procedures in andSection;200.72 of the proposed regulations have been deleted, and andSection;andSection;200.73 through 200.75 incorporate and make applicable to the Chapter 1LEA Program the general complaint procedures in andSection;andSection; 76.780through 76.782 of EDGAR. Section 200.80 How Does an LEA Evaluate Student Achievement? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested allowing projects to test childrenevery other year, such as in grades 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, rather than requiringan annual assessment. This commenter also suggested that increased numbersof children in each State be given the National Assessment of EducationalProgress (NAEP) to give valid State results based on that assessment, orallow use of normed tests in even grades and predicted norm test resultsin odd grades.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The use of alternate year results, different instrumentsin alternate years, or predicted scores would not provide the informationrequired by section 1021 of the Act related to school and student programimprovement. Section 1021(a) requires an ``annual review'' of the program'seffectiveness and comparison of gains from one year to the next, whichcould not be accomplished by these methods. Further, while NAEP test datamay be useful at the State level, they could not be used for program improvementat school and individual student levels, as required by section 1021 ofthe Act. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested a complete rewrite of andSection;200.80, emphasizing that the evaluation should focus solely on the basicand more advanced skills each child is expected to master, based on thedesired outcomes included in the LEA's application. The commenter furthersuggested that the LEA use measures that would provide specific informationregarding the degree to which each skill had been mastered, and that assessmentof more advanced skills include measurement of reasoning, analysis, interpretation,problem-solving, and decision-making in relation to the particular subjectsin which Chapter 1 services were being provided. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the type of informationthe commenter describes is appropriate for Chapter 1 assessment and wouldbe useful for LEAs to include in their evaluations of the Chapter 1 LEAProgram. However, andSection; 200.80 is designed to set national standardsthat can be used for two purposes: (1) Provide data in a manner that maybe aggregated into State and national totals as required by section 1019of the Act; and (2) provide one base of data to be used in program improvementefforts under sections 1020 and 1021 of the Act. The commenter's suggestion,although appropriate at the local level, would not allow for aggregation.In addition, the level of prescription it would entail would not be consistentwith Congress' intent that the standards not be ``unduly burdensome.''See H.R. Rept. 95, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 25-26 (1987). The report goeson to say that the ``existing Chapter 1 Evaluation and Information ReportingSystem (TIERS) and the existing evaluation models would be appropriate.''<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed various concerns regardingthe use of norm-referenced standardized tests to evaluate the impact ofChapter 1 on a child's achievement. The commenters contended that thesetests fail to measure how well Chapter 1 children achieve in the ``basicand more advanced skills all children are expected to master'' specifiedin section 1012(b) of the Act; the tests are not necessarily aligned withwhat is being taught in the Chapter 1 program; competency-based or criterion-referencedtests used by States are more appropriate measures; norm-referenced testscontain cultural and ethnic bias that distorts results; and, in general,the tests are too narrowly based to measure the full impact of the Chapter1 program. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary is aware of the limitations of norm-referencedstandardized tests, and does not intend that they be used by LEAs as thesole measure of the effectiveness of the Chapter 1 LEA Program. Section200.35 clearly states that, in addition to use of measures of student achievementbased on the national standards contained in Subpart H of the regulations.LEAs must also measure how well children attain the desired outcomes includedin each LEA's application. LEAs may, and are encouraged to, state theirdesired outcomes in terms other than scores on standardized achievementtests. Congress made this clear, stating its ``intent that measures andstandards used to demonstrate progress toward desired outcomes may be somethingother than nationally normed standardized test scores.'' H.R. Rept. 567,100th Cong., 2d Sess. 325 (1988) (Conf. Rept.). However, the use of nationallynormed standardized test results, or results of tests that may be equatedto nationally normed tests, provides a means to aggregate results to Stateand national totals, giving an overall, if imperfect, measure of programimpact. Although acknowledging the limitations, the Secretary believesthat these test scores and their aggregation provide significant and usefulinformation on the success of the Chapter 1 program to LEAs, SEAs, theDepartment, and the Congress. With regard to the alleged cultural biasof standardized tests, the Secretary recognizes that, in general, manyminority group students may not perform as well on standardized tests aswhite students. Although some attribute these results to culturally biasedtest items, others believe they may also be indicative of substandard educationprovided to some minority children. Finally, the Secretary reiterates thatscores on nationally normed standardized tests need not be the sole measureused to determine success of students in the Chapter 1 program, any morethan they are used solely to determine success of children in the regularprogram. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended deleting andSection; 200.80(a)(2),which prescibes how an LEA must assess the progress of Chapter 1 childrenin more advanced skills. The commenter contended that the requirementsin andSection; 200.35(a)(1), which require evaluation of progress in basicand more advanced skills, are sufficient. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 200.35(a) contains the requirements placedon LEAs with regard to the evaluation of projects. Section 200 80(a)(2)contains the national standards by which one of those requirements_assessingmore advanced skills_will be met. Section 1435(a) of the Act requires theSecretary to develop national standards and provide States and LEAs notification,in advance, of the requirements the standards contain. Sections 200.80through 200.89 of the regulations carry out the provisions of section 1435(a).<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the requirement in andSection;200.80(a)(1) that requires assessment in language arts in addition to readingand mathematics. Commenters noted the paucity of testing materials availablein listening and speaking skills and questioned the validity of those thatare available. Another commenter objected to the increased burden thattesting in this additional area may entail. <T3>Discussion: </T3>By including language arts as an area for assessment,the Secretary did not intend to increase burden on LEAs; rather, the additionof language arts reflects the growing number of children LEAs report asreceiving services in this area. The Secretary assumes that, in general,LEAs provide services in language arts or reading, but not both. If assessmentand reporting are limited to reading and mathematics, a growing numberof children receiving language arts rather than reading instruction willnot be included in the aggregate information submitted to the States andthe Department. However, to make clear that this requirement is not meantto increase testing burden, and in response to comments questioning theavailability and validity of language arts tests other than reading, theSecretary has modified the requirement. In making this modification, theSecretary believes that for an LEA operating a program that includes bothlanguage arts and reading, a test of basic and more advanced reading skillscan be used to assess the achievement of the Chapter 1 participants inboth areas.<T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.80(a)(1) has been modified to allow LEAsoperating Chapter 1 language arts programs to assess achievement of childrenin these programs using either a language arts or reading test. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern over the use ofreading comprehension and problems and applications subtest scores as measuresof more advanced skills in reading and mathematics. Some commenters statedthat the measures were inadequate; other commenters pointed out that theterm ``problems and applications'' was not used in all standardized mathematicstests. Other commenters supported the proposed regulation. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary is aware of the limitation of the useof the subtest scores as measures of more advanced skills and expects LEAswill use additional means to assess the impact of the Chapter 1 programon children's mastery of more advanced skills. However, for the purposesof reporting data to State and national levels, it is necessary to havea measure that may be aggregated to State and national totals. Further,the Secretary is committed to gathering data in the manner that imposesthe least burden on LEAs. At present, it appears that the subtests statedabove will provide the requisite information in a manner that will notimpose significant new data gathering responsibilities on LEAs. As newmaterials to assess more advanced skills become available, the Secretarywill review whether the new instruments are more appropriate. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.80(a)(2) has been revised to take into accountdiffering terminology regarding the subtests that exist among the varioustests. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the use of ``comprehension''and ``problems and applications'' subtest scores as measures of more advancedskills, stating that these scores are highly correlated with overall readingand mathematics scores. Another commenter suggested the regulations shouldmore explicitly require use of composite scores of reading and mathematicstests to parallel the subtest scores used to measure more advanced skills.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Although there is some correlation between the subtestscores in reading comprehension and composite reading scores and problemsand applications subtest scores and composite mathematics scores, the subtestsmeasure a component of the composite score that most closely approximatesmore advanced skills. In addition, although stipulating subtest scoresfor more advanced skills measurement implies that composite scores be usedfor measurement of basic skills, the Secretary does not intend that thisbe a requirement. LEAs are free to choose any measurement devices describedin andSection; 200.80. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters asked how the estimate of achievementin the absence of Chapter 1 services can be determined. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Norm-referenced tests provide the base for expectedachievement without additional services such as Chapter 1 provides. ForState and locally developed tests, the equating study will likewise providethis information. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>Numerous commenters objected to the requirement thatLEAs report only on test results compiled over a 12-month period, citingthat 9-month, fall-spring results should be allowed. The commenters presenteda number of reasons: (1) Many children leave school and/or the Chapter1 program during the summer months; hence, results would be available onfewer children. (2) Testing on an annual cycle would require LEAs to followchildren beyond the school year, which would be burdensome. (3) LEAs shouldbe allowed the flexibility to test on 9- or 12-month cycles. (4) Districtschoosing spring-to-spring cycles would use the spring test for eligibility,resulting in fewer eligible children, since spring scores are higher thanfall ones. (5) The fall-to-fall cycle poses problems with regard to programimprovement, since results for schools would not be available until latefall, making program changes during the initial year difficult. (6) Twelve-monthtesting confounds the results of Chapter 1, because it includes the summerperiod when children receive no services. (7) There is no legal basis forrequiring testing over 12 months, since the House Report states that theTIERS model would be appropriate and TIERS allows testing on a fall-springcycle. Several additional commenters supported the annual cycle, citingthe more valid results the method gives. One commenter suggested that atransition year would allow the LEAs currently on a fall-spring cycle toadjust to an annual one. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has given serious consideration to thepoints raised by the commenters and, because of the importance of the issue,will discuss each one at greater length than is usually done. The discussionfollows the order of the points raised above. (1) Although it is true that data on some students will be lost in movingto a 12-month rather than a 9-month cycle, the Secretary believes thatthe increased validity of the data outweighs this concern. Fall-springtesting, which relies on depressed fall scores as a base, consistentlyoverstates the gains children make in the Chapter 1 program. When retestedthe next fall, these children have lost a significant portion of the reportedgains, only to have that same ``gain'' determined again the following spring.The 12-month cycle more accurately measures the continuous progress ofchildren in the program, rather than repeatedly measuring the same ``gain''several times over. (2) Although districts will be required to follow children beyond the schoolyear, this requirement is also implicit in section 1021(f) of the Act,which requires LEAs to maintain records on individual students beyond oneyear. (3) The Secretary does not intend to restrict the flexibility of LEAs whowish to test on a 9-month cycle. Those LEAs may continue to so test. However,the regulations require that, for reporting evaluation results under section1019(a)(2) of the Act and in determining schools and students in need ofprogram improvement under sections 1020 and 1021 of the Act, annual resultsmust be used. LEAs that wish to insert the additional test point requiredby the 9-month cycle for their own purposes are free to do so. (4) Use of spring scores may result in fewer children being eligible forChapter 1; however, this is because fall test scores are apparently artificiallydepressed. Districts concerned about this may choose a fall-to-fall cycle,which, while not as accurate with regard to selection as a spring-to-springperiod, would result in gain scores comparable in validity to the spring-to-springmethod. (5) The fall-to-fall cycle does result in later identification of schoolsand students in need of program improvement. However, the modified timelinefor implementation of both local and joint program improvement plans willallow for either the spring-to-spring or fall-to-fall cycle. (6) The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the real impact of theChapter 1 LEA Program on a child's achievement. There is general agreementthat the fall test results are artificially depressed_perhaps because ofthe summer vacation from school. Comparison of this test score with a springtest score taken after the child has had a prolonged time in school apparentlyinflates the gain. By using an annual cycle, test points, whether bothfall or both spring, are comparable, providing a more adequate assessmentof the child's real progress. (7) The House Report states that, in developing national standards, ``theexisting Chapter 1 Evaluation and Information Reporting System and theexisting evaluation models would be appropriate.'' H.R. Rept. 95, 100thCong., 1st Sess. 25-26 (1987). The Chapter 1 system has involved both annualand fall-spring test cycles, but, because of its greater validity, theDepartment has been encouraging LEAs to move to an annual testing cycle.Currently, over half of the reported data is based on annual test results.The Secretary believes the annual cycle is consistent with the requirementthat the Department establish national standards for evaluation and withthe guidance contained in the House Report. The Secretary is aware, however,that the switch from a fall-spring to an annual testing cycle will requirecertain adjustments by LEAs, particularly in terms of following studentsfrom one grade to the next. Therefore, he has determined that, in someinstances, more time may be needed to make this adjustment. <T3>Changes: </T3>Section 200.80(b)(2)(ii) has been added to allow LEAscurrently measuring achievement on a fall-spring basis to do so for the1989-90 school year only, if they provide evidence to their SEAs that immediateimplementation of the annual cycle would impose substantial hardship. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the 12-monthcycle would not allow use of the same form of the test for both pre- andpost-tests. Another commenter questioned whether norming dates for an annualtest cycle exist.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Many nationally normed tests cover more than one grade.Hence, they may be used, within their grade spans, for both pre- and post-tests.In addition, publishers furnish norming dates for annual cycles <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that there was no way to developa local norm. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Some LEAs provide sufficient data to establish localnorms. If they wish, those LEAs may use their local norms in assessingthe impact of Chapter 1. If no such norms are available, LEAs must useeither State norms or those provided by the test publisher. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested revising andSection; 200.80(e)to require use of the current edition of a test or a test published withinthe last seven years, noting that the edition immediately previous to thecurrent one might be too old to be valid. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has been concerned about the use oftests normed several years ago to assess Chapter 1 for several reasons:(1) Use of older normed tests provides inflated scores for Chapter 1 studentsthat do not accurately reflect their needs; (2) the higher scores receivedon older normed tests may exclude from eligibility children who need Chapter1 services; (3) use of tests normed at different times makes comparisonamong results difficult; and (4) aggregation of results of tests normedat different times does not provide the most accurate picture of the impactof Chapter 1 Although the Secretary urges all LEAs to use the current edition of a testto assess Chapter 1, he wishes to allow LEAs some flexibility. Since theperiod between when tests are normed is not controlled by LEAs, the Secretaryis concerned that the seven-year time limit suggested by the commenteris arbitrary. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.81 What Technical Standards Does an LEA Apply in EvaluatingStudent Achievement? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended adding a new provision to andSection;200.81, specifying that limited English proficient and handicapped childrenshould be assessed on the same basis as other children. That assessmentshould be based on the full range of services they are provided under Chapter1 and designed so as not to confuse Chapter 1 effects with other needs.Further, the assessment should be valid for the specific population beingassessed. The commenter noted the suggestion followed language includedin Senate Report 222, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1988). <T3>Discussion: </T3>The issue of assessment procedures for limited Englishproficient and handicapped children was further considered in the House-Senateconference to rectify differences between House and Senate versions ofthe legislation. The Conference Report contains specific language on thisissue. H.R. Rept. 567, 100th Cong.,. 2d Sess. 322-23 (1988) (Conf. Rept.).That language is included in andSection; 200.31(c)(5) of the regulationsregarding LEA needs assessment. This is consistent with the discussionin the report that the assessment procedures be designed to identify properlylimited English proficient and handicapped children eligible for Chapter1 services. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Section 200.82 What Procedures Does an LEA Use in Evaluating Student Achievement?<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the proposed regulations didnot allow for use of criterion-referenced tests, which, in the commenter'sState, are used to assess progress in basic and more advanced skills. Accordingto the commenter, the requirement for norm- referenced tests would placean undue burden on LEAs in this State. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The provisions in andSection;andSection; 200.82(b)(2)and 200.83 address the use of other than norm-referenced tests for reportingresults of Chapter 1. Moreover, andSection; 200.88(c)(2) specifically allowsChapter 1 funds to be used to perform studies to equate tests, where possible,and conform results of those tests to the Chapter 1 common reporting scale.The Secretary is aware, however, that State and locally developed criterion-referencedtests may not always be able to be equated with nationally normed tests.In these circumstances, the requirement that data be aggregated to Stateand Federal levels would not allow use of such tests for purposes of Chapter1. <T3>Changes. </T3>None. Section 200.83 What Alternative Procedures May an LEA Use? <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested allowing States to use nationallynormed tests every other year and to use State assessment scores, equatedto the nationally normed results, in the alternate years. <T3>Discussion: </T3>This procedure would result in pre-testing Chapter1 students on one test and post-testing them the following year on another.Thus, it would not provide a valid basis for assessing gains the studentshave made. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters expressed concern regarding use of otherthan norm-referenced tests as a basis for aggregating results of the impactof the Chapter 1 program to State and Federal levels. One commenter questionedwhether procedures some States require for State-mandated tests yield validresults, particularly where States have established procedures for selectionor inclusion of test results without regard to the size of standard erroror other considerations of validity. Another commenter questioned whetherinclusion of a large number of State competency tests_even if equated witha norm-referenced test_would produce valid results. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The provisions in andSection;andSection; 200.82(b)(2)and 200.83 are designed to provide flexibility to State and local officialsin the matter of testing, reduce the amount of testing required for Chapter1 to a minimum, and still provide valid results that can be expressed inthe common reporting scale. Review by the Secretary of alternative procedureswill be directed at ensuring the standards in andSection; 200.83(b) are met.<T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the provision that alternativeprocedures for evaluation be subject to approval by the Secretary. Rather,the commenter stated that andSection; 200.83(b) contains adequate guidelinesand recommended that the SEA, which is closer to the local situation, haveapproval authority. The commenter also stated that assessment of the impactof Chapter 1 on the regular program would be discouraged if such assessmentprocedures were subject to Federal approval. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The alternative procedures in andSection; 200.83 applyonly to measures to be aggregated to State and Federal levels, and do notapply to local or State efforts to assess the impact of Chapter 1 on studentperformance in the regular program. Because data must be aggregated tonational totals and must produce results that can be expressed in the commonreporting scale established by the Secretary, the Secretary must determinethat alternative procedures meet the requirements in andSection; 200.83(b).The Secretary does not intend this procedure to inhibit use of other thannationally normed tests; rather, it is to ensure data reported to the Congressby the Secretary meet certain standards. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the proposed alternative proceduresin andSection; 200.83 would only allow procedures that result in a numberscore that can be converted to the common reporting scale. The commenterfelt that this restriction was not consistent with the spirit of the Act.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Alternative procedures must produce results that canbe aggregated with those produced by nationally normed tests. The Secretarydoes not intend to exclude any procedure that accomplishes this goal andmeets the other standards in andSection; 200.83(b). <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.84 How Does an LEA Report the Results of Student Achievementto the SEA? <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked if the term ``common reporting scale''in andSection; 200.84(a)(1)(i) refers to TIERS and, if so, suggested theregulations specifically refer to TIERS to make clear the requirement.Another commenter asked if the term refers to the NCE scale. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The common reporting scale currently used to collectaggregate data is the NCE scale, which was also used in TIERS. During regulationdevelopment, especially in the negotiated rulemaking process, the Departmentconcurred with recommendations from State and local representatives thatthe Chapter 1 regulations regarding evaluation should not contain the detailsincluded in TIERS. Rather, that kind of specific information would be providedin the Chapter 1 policy manual as guidance. Further, the Secretary is investigatingand will continue to investigate other methods of evaluation that can providemeasures capable of aggregation. Because the term ``common reporting scale''is more general than ``NCE'' or ``TIERS,'' it would continue to be appropriateif a better means of gathering and aggregating results is found. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.86 What Requirements Govern an SEA Sampling Plan? <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the requirement that the  samplingplan be submitted to the Secretary for approval, suggesting that the SEAshould have the plan available for review by the Department. The commenterstated the requirement would be burdensome and would constitute a changefrom past practice. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The requirement that the Secretary establish nationalstandards for evaluation requires attention to the issue of sampling. Ratherthan specifying in regulations procedures to be used, the Secretary hasleft to the States the flexibility to design sampling systems most appropriatefor them. The Secretary will then review and approve plans that providereliable and representative data. The requirement for approval by the Secretarywas contained in the regulations governing the initial establishment ofTIERS. (See 46 FR 5189, Jan. 19, 1981, andSection; 200.176(b)(2).) Hence,the current requirement is consistent with past practice. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.87 How Does an SEA Aggregate LEA Student Achievement Data forInclusion in Its Evaluation? <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters objected to the provision in andSection;200.87(a)(4)(i) requiring inclusion of data on the number of students excludedfrom the evaluation because of missing or erroneous data. One commenterclaimed the requirement was unneeded, because the data would be availablefrom the State performance report. <T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 200.87(a)(4) is part of the national standardsfor evaluation that the Secretary is required to set, and necessary forSEAs and the Department to assess the validity of the data collected. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.88 For What Evaluation Activities May an LEA or SEA Use FundsAvailable Under This Part?<T3> Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the statement in andSection;200.88(c)(3) that Chapter 1 funds may be used for ``[t]esting an appropriatenumber of children no longer receiving Chapter 1 services,'' contendingthe provision is vague. <T3>Discussion:</T3> As noted in a response to comments on andSection; 200.35,the Conference Report accompanying the Act makes clear Congress' intentthat, in measuring sustained gains, sampling procedures may be used. Theword ``appropriate'' is used to indicate that not all children need befollowed_only the number necessary to make a determination for the population.<T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 200.89 For What Evaluation Activities May an LEA or SEA Not UseFunds Available Under This Part? <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the prohibitions in andSection;200.89 (b)-(c) against using Chapter 1 funds for test development activitiesand establishment of State and local norms appear to conflict with theprovision in andSection; 200.82(b)(2), which allows LEAs to use other thannationally normed tests provided the results of the test can be equatedwith scores of nationally normed tests. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary does not believe these two provisionsare incompatible. If LEAs choose to use tests that are not nationally normedto meet the standards in Subpart H, the Secretary assumes these are teststhat State and local agencies have developed for their own general purposes.Sections 200.89 (b)-(c) prohibit the use of Chapter 1 funds for developingor norming such tests. However, as indicated in andSection; 200.88(c)(2),Chapter 1 funds may be used to equate these tests to nationally normedtests to meet the standards in Subpart H. Moreover, the Secretary is awarethat an LEA may wish to develop measures to assess the impact of Chapter1, such as those created by the Chapter 1 teacher for use in the Chapter1 project. The Secretary does not intend the prohibition in andSection; 200.89(c)to apply in these circumstances.<T3>Changes:</T3> A change has been made to clarify that andSection; 200.89applies to test development related to data to be aggregated at State andnational levels. Cooperation With Audits_EDGAR (andSection;andSection; 75.910 and 76.910) <T3>Comment:</T3> Six commenters expressed opposition to the changes proposedby these sections. Several commenters believed that the Department lackslegal authority to issue such a regulation, particularly as it was interpretedunder the ``<T2>Supplementary Information</T2>'' heading explaining the proposed changes.Some of the commenters maintained that requiring that audit interviewsbe tape recorded or be attended by a third party designated by the auditeedoes not unreasonably restrict auditor access to auditee personnel. A thirdargument was that the proposed changes, by giving unilateral authorityto the Inspector General to determine what is reasonable access, couldlead to abuse by ``overzealous'' Federal auditors. The final issue raisedwas that a grantee had no assurance of an accurate record of an audit interviewwithout tape recording or requiring the presence of a third person. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The cited portions of the Inspector General Act, togetherwith the Secretary's general authority to issue regulations and to requiregrantees to maintain records, authorize the Secretary to issue regulationsrequiring reasonable access to auditee personnel. The Inspector General'sauthority to examine records is meaningless if the Inspector General'sauditors cannot require oral explanations of those records. Furthermore,the Inspector General Act gives Federal auditors considerable professionaldiscretion as to methods for obtaining necessary information. Section 4(b)(1)of the Inspector General Act requires that audits be conducted in accordancewith standards established by the U.S. Comptroller General as set forthin ``Government Auditing Standards'' (the ``Yellow Book''), 1988 revision,effective January 1989. The newly revised Yellow Book specifies that ``auditorschoose and conduct auditing tests and procedures that, in their professionaljudgments, are appropriate in the circumstances to achieve the audit objectives''(page 4-1) as well as ``determining the nature, timing, and content ofaudit steps and procedures to test for compliance * * *'' (page 4-2). TheYellow Book also states (page 3-17) that ``denial by the audited entityof the opportunity to meet with officials and employees of the organization,program or activity under audit'' is an unacceptable scope impairment.Auditors must obtain ``sufficient, competent and relevant evidence'' toafford a reasonable basis for their judgments and conclusions (page 3-11).The standards provide that ``testimonial evidence obtained under conditionswhere persons may speak freely is more credible than testimonial evidenceobtained under compromising conditions (e.g., where the persons may beintimidated)'' (page 6-18).The regulations clarify what interview conditions imposed by auditees wouldnot only impair the independence of the auditor but would diminish theinterview's use as sufficient, competent, and relevant audit evidence.The Inspector General has determined that restrictions on auditor accessto personnel such as tape recording or requiring third party presence atan interview amount to denial of access because of the intimidating influenceof such restrictions on an individual who might risk (or believe that hewould risk) his employment or future work relationships by making statementsexposing the auditee to criticism. financial recovery action, or otherFederal administrative sanction. Some commenters suggested that the InspectorGeneral's ``Hotline,'' the subpoena authority, and the statutory duty toreport lack of cooperation to the ``head of the establishment'' (definedin the Inspector General Act as the Secretary of Education (5 U.S.C. Appendix3, section 11(1)), are the exclusive recourse the Inspector General hasfor dealing with denial of access to auditee personnel. However, ``Hotline''contacts, especially from anonymous callers, are not a feasible substitutefor explaining to an auditor face-to-face the contents of detailed financialrecords or the policies and procedures, e.g., internal controls, surroundingthe administration of a grant. The Inspector General's subpoena power islimited to documentary evidence and thus in any event would not addressthe problem of access to personnel. As far as dealing with the issue raised that a grantee had no assuranceof an accurate record of an audit interview without tape recording or requiringthe presence of a third person, the Secretary does not believe this isa valid argument for the reasons stated more fully under the heading ``<T2>Supplementary Information</T2>'' in the preamble to the proposed regulations.Auditors are instructed to follow procedures designed to ensure an accuraterecord. Written summaries of interviews can be shared with the auditee,the only exception being whistle-blowing disclosures. Most importantly,the procedures do not permit an adverse finding to be based on anonymouslysupplied information This information is useful only as a ``lead'' enablingthe auditor to obtain objective information that would be cited in theaudit report and that would be available to the audited agency. These proceduresshould obviate any concern about ``overzealous'' auditors; the InspectorGeneral's objective as well as the grantee's is to ensure an accurate recordof audit proceedings. <T3>Changes:</T3> The legal citations for these sections have been correctedby designating the general United States Code reference to the InspectorGeneral Act of 1978 as 5 U.S.C.
