The Machinists asked for help in case the strike at the world'sbiggest and busiest manufacturer of passenger jets runs long, saidTom Baker, president of Machinists Local 751.   No contract talks were scheduled.   None have been held since the Machinists, including 43,300 inthe Seattle area, rejected a three-year contract and walked outOct. 4. The strike also affects plants in Wichita, Kan., Portland,Ore., and several other sites.   The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers inWashington state. Their leaders met Monday.   ``This was a real upbeat meeting,'' Baker said. ``People arewilling to do whatever they can do monetarily. They're going toform a hardship fund, that type of thing.''   The support did not involve refusal to cross picket lines. Allof Boeing's unions have contracts that prohibit sympathy strikes.   Larry Kenney, president of the Washington State Labor Council,said the hardship fund would help strikers with mortgage paymentsand other bills. He said the other unions also promised to set up atemporary employment center.   ``This is a classic labor dispute because the issues are clearlydefined,'' Kenney said. ``Is the company going to use its economicleverage or are the employees going to use their economic leverage?That's what it's all supposed to be about.''   Boeing officials said they did not know how to interpret theshow of union support.   ``I still don't think anybody at this point knows how long astrike it will be,'' said spokesman Paul Binder.   A company that advertised for aircraft maintenance workers wasdeluged by hundreds of job-seekers, including Boeing strikers.Intertec Aviation Co. of Phoenix said its recruiter's visit toEverett on Sunday was planned before the strike.   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began, andhopes to deliver 92 more by the end of the year.   Five consecutive years of record orders have given the company abacklog that stretches into the late 1990s. That backlog was behindMachinists' demand for better wages and lower mandatory overtime.   Boeing offered a raise 4 percent, followed by 3 percent raisesin 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8 percent of gross earningsthis year and 3 percent in 1990.   Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours perquarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved.   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for thefirst half of 1989 and had profits of $614 million on sales of$16.96 billion in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
