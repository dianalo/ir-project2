(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>GTE's New Line on Customer ServiceandM;These days, a systems integration plan is likely to include linking thecompany's field staff to the data center's mainframe.andP;  The trend isn'texactly new.andP;  Sales representatives, delivery route drivers and inventoryclerks have been taking handheld computers into the field for years forroutine data entry tasks.andM;But at GTE Data Services in Temple Terrace, Fla., they're using new, morepowerful handhelds to build a distributed-computing architecture closelylinking the field with regional headquarters.andP;  Going considerably beyond dataentry, GTE's system closely couples processing power in the field with GTE'snetwork of mainframes and minicomputers.andP;  Dubbed Automated WorkAdministration System, or AWAS, the new application automates the dispatchingsystem for telephone repair workers.andM;An Integrated ApproachandM;AWAS integrates existing IBM mainframes at GTE's four regional InformationProcessing Centers with Digital Equipment Corp.'s midrange VAX computers atlocal Dispatch Administration Centers (DACs).andP;  Workstations for dispatchclerks and a modem for connecting the handhelds to the system both hang offthe VAX systems.andM;Partly by distributing more processing power to the field and partly bybuilding flexibility into the applications software, GTE is hoping tosidestep some of the pitfalls that can accompany attempts to automate fieldstaff, says Chuck W. Mead, vice president of operations software and supportfor GTE Data Services.andM;Mead inherited the project in 1988 when he left a two-year stint at GeneralTelephone of the Southwest, where he had been vice president of informationmanagement.andP;  By then, work on a prototype at GTE, begun in 1987, was completeand the design process was already a few months along.andP;  It was something of ahomecoming for Mead--he worked at GTE Data Services in various roles from1972 to 1986.andM;GTE Data Services, a subsidiary of Stamford, Conn.-based GTE Corp., wasformed in 1967 to provide information management and systems development forGTE telephone operations in the United States.andP;  Now it's one of the largestsoftware development firms around with 3,200 employees, about 2,000 of thembased at the firm's $30 million Temple Terrace software development facility.andM;In recent weeks, two field tests of the dispatching system were completed.andO;In Richmond, Ind., the company tested the system in a rural setting, and inClearwater, Fla., it examined the system's ability to automate dispatching inan urban area.andP;  &quot;We really have a good couple of months under our belt seeinghow it runs in a live environment,&quot; Mead says.andM;Mead calls the tests &quot;pilot-plus,&quot; because the dispatch centers in Richmondand Clearwater converted completely to the automated system.andP;  &quot;We had someproblems through the pilot with cycle times, but we've reduced [them] by anorder of magnitude,&quot; he says.andP;  By February, the cycle time problems werelargely eliminated, and both pilots were considered a success.andP;  &quot;Now, we'rein the process of providing the software and rolling it out in areas ofIllinois, California and Texas,&quot; Mead says.andM;Powerful HandheldsandM;About 135 handheld computers were used in the pilot, all model T4000s fromItron Inc. of Spokane, Wash.andP;  The model's memory capacity ranges from 256 to896 kilobytes, and GTE opted for the high end.andP;  &quot;These are not dumbterminals.andP;  They are programmed in C language.andP;  They have [nearly] a megabyteof memory,&quot; Mead says.andM;The handheld computers are currently performing basic functions, says Mead.andO;Service orders and trouble reports are downloaded from the AWAS application,either in a batch covering the worker's day or one job at time, depending onthe needs of each dispatch center.andP;  The field employees send completionreports and time reports back to the system.andP;  And there is room forexpansion.andP;  One long-term possibility is a diagnostic system that workers canuse to troubleshoot repairs from the job site.andM;&quot;There are other people who use handheld terminals, but they are really justdumb connections, generally to a mainframe.andP;  This thing here is a full-blown,stand-alone microcomputer,&quot; says Mead.andP;  That intelligence was a prerequisiteto distributing the application.andM;GTE's AWAS uses an architecture that makes a lot of sense, according toGeorge Lindamood, program director for industry services at the Gartner GroupInc. in Stamford, Conn.andP;  In any on-line transaction-processing application,about 25% of the computer's processing time is spent verifying the input dataand formatting the output screen.andP;  If the forms are processed on a handheldcomputer, and the data are verified and compressed before they are sent backto the mainframe, then the mainframe can be spared for other uses, saysLindamood.andP;  &quot;There's no reason why all that [processing] should be done onthe mainframe,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Mainframe costs per MIPS [million instructions persecond] run about $120,000-plus.andP;  You can push it down to the handheld wherea MIPS costs less than $1,000.&quot;andM;An Explosive MarketandM;Lindamood believes that the market for handheld computers may explode in the1990s, as did the microcomputer market in the 1980s.andP;  Costs are dropping andpower is increasing in ways conducive to a surge in the number of users.andM;Holding back that surge is software, says Lindamood.andP;  If an application isintroduced that can increase the popularity of handhelds--the way thatspreadsheet applications have boosted the use of microcomputers--then themarket will take off, he predicts.andM;Japan is likely to lead the way.andP;  Estimates for handheld sales in Japan runas high as 3 million units for 1990, a bit larger than the entire worldwidemarket in 1989, according to Lindamood.andM;Until now, sales of handhelds have been growing at a modest rate and stillrepresent a relatively small percentage of the computer market.andP;  InfoCorp,Gartner Group's Santa Clara subsidiary, estimated the market for handheldcomputers at 952,000 worldwide in 1983.andP;  By 1989, that market had swelled toabout 2.6 million, with all but about 98,000 in the low-end, under-$500range.andM;Beyond MIPSandM;As a sophisticated user of high-end handheld computers, GTE is looking to getsome additional benefits from its distributed approach besides cheaper MIPS.andO;&quot;With a dumb terminal, you are interacting with a mainframe or a mini, andthat's all being done in real time,&quot; Mead says.andP;  If the number of usersincreases, additional communications equipment is often required.andM;With a distributed application, however, communication with the host is muchmore efficient.andP;  &quot;You have everything loaded up, you make the connection, hita button and then [your information] uploads,&quot; says Mead.andP;  &quot;The completion,the time reporting and all of that is not in real time.andP;  Generally, it takesabout two minutes [to communicate with the handhelds], and it savescommunication time.&quot;andM;Another advantage with distributing part of the application down to thehandheld is that forms and help screens are all locally resident.andP;  This makesthem easy to learn and use outside the mainframe environment.andM;The system follows the same formats electronically that previously existed onpaper reports.andP;  That should cut training time and go a long way towardgetting field workers to embrace the new system.andP;  &quot;Because we are givinganother piece of equipment to the field technician, we wanted to make it asuser friendly and as indestructible as we could,&quot; says Mead.andP;  &quot;We tried todiminish future shock as much as we could.&quot;andM;Although the handhelds are key to GTE's new application, &quot;the backbone ofthis system is what we call the dispatch algorithm,&quot; says Mead.andP;  &quot;The AWASsystem is really an optimizer.andP;  It knows where all the employees are, itknows what their skills are, it knows what work needs to be done and then itcontinually optimizes for that.andP;  It will optimize that schedule every two tofive minutes for the entire [dispatch] center,&quot; says Mead.andM;If the algorithm is the system's backbone, a series of tables that drive thealgorithm is the system's heart.andP;  Skill tables, for example, are used todescribe the skills of each employee.andP;  &quot;When work is selected by thealgorithm, it matches the work to the skill of [a particular] employee,&quot; Meadsays.andP;  &quot;We also have 'known building' tables, so that we know what to expectin certain buildings and who to send to particular buildings.&quot;andP;  Thanks totables, each DAC can tailor the system.andM;&quot;You've got to understand that this is a significantly different way ofviewing our business,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I think we've succeeded in making this veryflexible and very accommodating for the way a particular DAC does its work.andO;And the way we've done that is through tables.&quot;andM;GTE is counting on the system's flexibility to help win acceptance amongservice workers and dispatch clerks.andP;  &quot;That was the rationale for theselection of this architecture,&quot; Mead says.andP;  If all goes according to plan,Mead hopes that flexibility will help deflect employee resistance to theincreased automation that AWAS will bring to the workplace.andM;The Maintenance ViewandM;It probably was a good idea to consider human issues not only in the system'sdesign but also in the way AWAS was pitched to the rank-and-file.andP;  Accordingto users who took part in the system's pilot, fear and suspicion presentedsome obstacles in the beginning, according to users who took part in thesystem's pilot.andM;Randy Ross, a facility maintenance worker at GTE in Richmond for the past 19years, was one of the first field workers to adopt the new system.andP;  Serviceworkers were able to switch over to the automated system after just sevenhours of training.andP;  Although Ross acknowledges some early problems withsoftware and problems in learning to operate the handhelds, he describes thetransition as generally smooth.andM;The major issues have been on the human side, Ross says.andP;  There was thenormal opposition to change and worry about learning a new technology, andrumors of job losses preceded the system.andP;  &quot;The first thing to get used to isnot to fear it as a computer, but try to recognize it as a tool,&quot; Ross says.andM;&quot;Like anything new, it met initial resistance,&quot; Ross adds.andP;  &quot;It was somethingelse to be thrown on the shoulders of outside craftspersons.&quot;andP;  As workerslearned that the system could make their jobs easier and give them greaterwork independence, the handheld computers gradually won over most serviceworkers, Ross says.andM;The dispatch clerks have the most at stake, however.andP;  The system replaces aprimarily manual dispatching scheme.andP;  Terminals connect dispatch clerks totrouble-reporting and service order systems on IBM mainframes at GTE'sregional processing centers, but, beyond that, the old manual dispatcherresembles the technology of a vintage World War II war room.andP;  Clerks trackworkers and the work that needs to be scheduled by shuffling magnetic markerson a large wall map of the service area.andM;Under AWAS, the map is replaced with a graphics workstation.andP;  The applicationautomatically updates the map, but clerks can override the system by movingsymbols around the screen with a mouse.andP;  The override feature comes in handy,because the database resident in an employee's head is sometimes moreaccurate than whatever is stored in the system.andM;For example, says Mead, in rural areas where route numbers are more prevalentthan street addresses, the system has difficulty pinpointing a work site.andO;&quot;What the computer will do is place that facility, but it could be within a20-mile area.andP;  The clerk will know that it is by a barn down the road.andP;  He orshe can take a mouse and move that facility to where it really is.&quot;andM;Initially, dispatch clerks thought the system would mean fewer jobs at thedispatch center and make those clerks who survived superfluous, according toSheree Leavell.andP;  Even with 10 years on the job, Leavell is still the leastsenior clerk at the Richmond dispatch center.andP;  News of an automated systemmade her feel particularly vulnerable.andM;Fears Put to RestandM;Clerks went through extensive training, learning not just how to operate thesystem but also how it works.andP;  Initial fears gave way to a strong endorsementfrom Leavell.andP;  &quot;In the very beginning, we all kind of thought [that peoplewould lose jobs], but now that it's here we see that it really takes peopleto monitor it,&quot; Leavell says.andM;What AWAS means in practice, she adds, is that clerks are making fewerroutine decisions and focusing on more important issues, like settingpriorities for scheduling service based on the immediate needs of customers.andO;According to Leavell, clerks can override the system when necessary toprovide support to customers with critical service needs.andM;GTE is hoping that interplay between human beings and the system will helpthe company play in the increasingly competitive market that has followedderegulation of the telephone system.andP;  &quot;What we're trying to do is improvethe quality of our service while holding the line on costs,&quot; says Mead.andM;Mead acknowledges that those are the goals of all telephone companies, but hebelieves that AWAS may keep GTE a step ahead.andP;  &quot;I think with this sytemthere's an opportunity to get more into what we call customer selectedcommitments,&quot; he says.andP;  For example, instead of waiting all day for someoneto come out and connect a new phone, a customer can make an appointment for,say, 11:00 A.M.andP;  on Wednesday.andP;  &quot;You call in, you want to have some work doneat your house at a particular time, and we enter that into the system,&quot; Meadsays.andP;  &quot;It's a hell of a lot better customer service.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
