But not with the topplayers of the LPGA. Not with Patty Sheehan.;   Sheehan, 35, a former San JoseState athlete who until recently was based in the Bay Area during her procareer, has 26 victories over 12 years, and on the women's pro golf tour thatputs her within shooting distance of the LPGA Hall of Fame. Unlike in mostsports in which a special committee or media members vote for a hall's newmembers, the LPGA expects its people to play their way in.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHEEHAN PURSUING HALL OF FAME  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Bay Area's Best of the Best; No. 20: Patty Sheehan; See also related storieson P. 12D of this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     To make it, one must win at least 30 official tournaments, including twodifferent major championships; or win 35 events, including one major; or win40 times, exclusive of a major title.;   So Sheehan, who has won twice at onemajor (the LPGA), is at a point where a top candidate's passions begin tostir. Yet, despite accomplishments that might make her worthy of most halls offame, she also is starting to question whether achieving the goal isrealistic.;   &quot;If they don't change the criteria, there will be nobody in theHall of Fame but a bunch of old ladies,&quot; Sheehan said recently. &quot;And soonthey'll die off and there won't be anybody alive in there and the whole thingwill be obsolete.&quot;;   It's tough and probably unfair. It's hard to believe,for example, that Judy Rankin hasn't made it. Over 24 years she won 26tournaments, including one major. She was LPGA player of the year twice anddominated her sport in the late 1970s.;   Came out with a bang; But fewplayers have hit the LPGA circuit with such thunderous acclaim as Sheehan, andit hasn't gone without notice. The Mercury News panel of experts voted her20th in a poll to determine the Bay Area sports impact personalities of thepast 20 years.;   She was the fastest player to reach $1 million in careerearnings, doing it in four years and nine months. She also was the fastest tohit the $2 million mark -- eight years, 10 months and 22 days.;   Has alreadywon $3 million;   Sheehan's pace of averaging more than $250,000 a year puther over $3 million this year. In the last nine years, she finished in the topfive in earnings seven times -- crisp testimony to consistent performance atabove-timberline levels.;   And yet she wonders if she'll make the LPGA hall.;  &quot;I just hope I won't be out there after I hit 40,&quot; Sheehan said. &quot;I haveother things I'm getting interested in. Golf is only a game, a nice way tomake a living. It doesn't fill up my entire being.&quot;;   Competition is muchgreater;   Sheehan believes Amy Alcott and maybe a couple of others on tourwill become Hall of Famers, but that will be it for a long while.;   &quot;Theproblem is when the criteria were first set up, a few people dominated ourtour,&quot; Sheehan said. &quot;They won over and over. Now, the competition is muchgreater. There are more different winners.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN HRUBY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  552  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 25, 199100330152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
