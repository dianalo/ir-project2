Masquerade balls are a bore; bachelor auctionsare passe; Cow Pie Bingo has come and gone. Catch hold of thelatest craze: rubber ducky races.   In such places as Nashua, N.H., San Jose, Calif., Kansas City,Mo., and Chicago, men, women and children are flocking toreservoirs, rivers and ponds to cheer on the little yellowcritters, according to a company that has leased the non-toxicducks to organizations in those communities.   It's all in the interest of their favorite good cause.   ``We've had the golf outings, the dinner dances _ prettystandard things,'' Northern Illinois Medical Center administratorBob Blazier said Friday. ``But this, this is different.''   On Saturday, about 5,000 ducks hit the waters of Boone Creek inMcHenry, 20 miles northwest of Chicago, on the hospital's behalf.   For the past few weeks, hospital supporters have been buyingduck ``adoption papers'' at $5 a pop, or a flock of 10 ducks(complete with duck T-Shirt) for $50. Adoption papers sport anumber corresponding to a number on a rubber ducky's bottom.   On Saturday, the duckies themselves will be ceremoniously dumpedfrom a truck into Boone's Creek for a race to the finish line.   First duck through the ``duck trap'' _ a contraption riggedacross the finish line that pulls the ducks in order from the water_ wins.   But that's not until after the ``guess the ducks in the truck''contest, to determine just how many of the fist-sized rubber duckswill be paddling for the finish line.   Boone Creek's duck race is just a drop in the bucket compared toIllinois Masonic Hospital's August duck dash, in which participantscan, for $250, become VID's _ Very Important Ducks.   In that contest, about 30,000 rubber ducks will be dropped offChicago's Michigan Avenue bridge for a race down the Chicago River.If the current isn't strong enough that day, a Chicago FireDepartment boat will be standing by with water cannons to propelthe ducks forward.   The fund-raising ducks are largely the brainchild of a Phoenix,Ariz., company that says it drew on a 19th century Irish pastimefor its inspiration.   Three years ago, during their first year in business, GreatAmerican Duck Races managed to convince just eight organizationsthat duck racing was the way to raise money. This year, 95 groupshave gone to ducks and next year, 103 have already been scheduled.   ``Racing rubber ducks _ it sounds so silly, but it is serious,''Michele Brown, the company's event coordinator, said Friday.   Unlike Cow Pie Bingo, in which fields are divided into squaresand players guess on which square a cow will leave its mark, muchplanning has gone into the duck-race business.   ``We're still working on perfecting the duck,'' said Brown.Among the considerations: ducks that can withstand hightemperatures and strong blowing winds.   Ducks that have paddled too far are even retired, spending theirgolden years as promotional ducks sold as part of the fund-raiser.   But the birds are no laughing matter. Brown said 10 races wereconducted last year for a youth charity, Children's MiracleNetwork. The races raised $1.3 million for the group, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
