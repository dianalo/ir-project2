Testifying for the second day before the Senate Appropriationssubcommittee on HUD and independent agencies, Kemp also said theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development would issue newguidelines to ensure competitiveness and more equitabledistribution of funds in the scandal-plagued moderaterehabilitation program.   ``I've asked my general counsel to prepare for the FederalRegister by June 1 the notification of fund availability,'' saidKemp. ``We want to make sure that the good guys ... are notsqueezed out of the system by political influence.''   Kemp suspended the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program onApril 26 after an audit by the HUD inspector general revealedseveral former HUD and other government officials were consultantsto public housing authorities obtaining grants to renovate andrepair subsidized housing for low-income families.   The consultants charged the housing authority or developerbetween $500 and $1,500 per unit, in many cases for doing littlemore than placing phone calls or writing to former governmentcolleagues.   The inspector general's audit also showed many states receivedmore than their alloted ``fair share'' of the grants while thosemost in need were shortchanged.   ``The integrity of the system is important for all of us,'' saidKemp, promising the inspector general would maintain an ongoingaudit of the program.   ``Those people who are going to participate in this program aregoing to know up front from day one that it is going to be auditedvery carefully.''   Asked by subcommittee chairwoman Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,how he would also ensure ``the good guy communities'' whichfollowed previous HUD regulations weren't punished, Kemp said therewould be no prejudice against those communities and projects thathad been approved before the suspension.   However he said it would not be possible to preserve theprogram's competitiveness if their proposals were given anyadvantage over new submissions.   ``They won't lose their position,'' he said. ``It will be lookedat very carefully, They've already done much of the work that'sinvolved but ... it will just be a broader competitive process.''   Mikulski also wanted some assurance that HUD was taking steps torecover any actual losses discovered by the department's audit.   The audit estimated that incorrect rent calculations in the 43projects reviewed by the inspector general would result inexcessive housing assistance totaling $58 million during the15-year contract period. Total excessive assistance for allprojects funded could approach $413 million, the report said.   ``Where we find that the rent levels have been set to highbecause of the inappropriate level of rehabilitation ... we will ona case-by-case basis take steps to roll back the rents and thatwill in turn save subsidy costs over the multiple year period,''said Jim Schoenberger, HUD general deputy assistant secretary.</TEXT></DOC>
