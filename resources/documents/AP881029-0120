Carrie Munson planned the funeral before her death because shewanted to see the faces of ``friends, associates and enemies,'' shesaid.   Munson, 62, is a former heroin addict with a fourth-gradeeducation who went on to get a college degree in her 40s and becomea broadcaster and social worker.   She is writing an autobiography, ``Bury Me in My Cap and Gown,''and said the funeral would be the perfect way to end the book.   ``You can't communicate with your friends and tell them how youfeel inside a box,'' Munson said.   ``This is a moment in my life that I will never forget and afterI'm gone I'll remember it too,'' said Munson, wearing the cap andgown she wore when she graduated from University ofWisconsin-Milwaukee in 1975.   The outfit made her stand out among the more than 100 people whopaid their respects at the New Hope Baptist Church. ``As I lookaround, I don't see any enemies. All I see is friends,'' she said.   The Rev. R.L. Lathan used his eulogy to praise Munson'sdetermination and faith in God.   ``You have stood up with faith,'' he said. ``Carrie, there is noguarantee you won't be able to wear that cap and gown again. Many ofus here with you may beat you to the grave.''   For Munson, the cap and gown are something to be proud of.   Until she was in her 40s, Munson had only a fourth-gradeeducation. After 25 years of drug addiction and small-time crime andseveral suicide attempts, she decided to do something with her life.   Munson said she prayed, began to hate the drugs and set out toprove herself by attending college.   ``I knew I wasn't stupid. I knew I wasn't dumb,'' she said. ``IfI take what I learned on the street and put it into this B.A. ...I'll have a masterpiece.''   Munson graduated with a degree in journalism and masscommunications in 1975. Since then, she has worked as a radio jazzshow host and as a social worker with Wisconsin CorrectionalServices.   ``The doctor says I'm dying. I know I'm a very sick woman. I havea lot of pain,'' Munson said. ``But I don't plan on going home,lying down and dying.''   Ziff Sistrunk said he took a bus from Chicago to attendSaturday's ceremony after reading about Munson's funeral plans in anewspaper article.   He sang the Frank Sinatra hit ``I Did It My Way'' during theceremony, saying he had read that Munson cherished the song.</TEXT></DOC>
