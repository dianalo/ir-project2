Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to eliminate three entire classes of nuclear missiles from Europe confronts the U.S. and its European allies with their most difficult political decision since they agreed in 1981 to deploy medium-range missiles in Europe.    After holding nearly five hours of talks with Mr. Gorbachev, Secretary of State George Shultz flew here yesterday from Moscow to discuss the Soviet leader's latest proposals with European leaders. Before leaving Moscow, Mr. Shultz said a superpower agreement eliminating medium-range missiles from Europe is &quot;close at hand.&quot;    His Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, agreed and added that prospects are &quot;fairly good&quot; for a second summit between Mr. Gorbachev and President Reagan.    President Reagan issued a statement from his home in Santa Barbara saying that the latest talks in Moscow &quot;hold promise for an agreement . . . in the not-too-distant future.&quot;    In European capitals, reaction to Mr. Gorbachev's sweeping proposal was cautious. Many European officials fear that an agreement to eliminate the two primary nuclear-weapons systems, medium-range and short-range missiles, from Europe would leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization more vulnerable to Soviet non-nuclear military superiority.    Politicians and arms experts throughout Europe reacted with trepidation. They hope the U.S. will slow Mr. Gorbachev's push for a sweeping deal by agreeing to something less far-reaching.    &quot;It is the denuclearization of Europe which gives rise to the biggest fears here,&quot; said David Bolton, director of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based military think tank.    Mr. Gorbachev's latest proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons from Europe has caused a stir for two reasons, one involving style, the other substance. First, the boldness of his leadership means that Moscow, rather than Washington, has taken the initiative in offering new proposals. Second, his proposals are so politically appealing to the public in Western Europe that governments are reluctant to respond negatively.    &quot;The speed of Gorbachev's performance in arms control related to his predecessors is impressive,&quot; says Gerald Frost, director of the Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies in London. &quot;Public opinion expects us to come up with an agreement, and it's Mr. Gorbachev, not President Reagan, who is coming up with the proposals.&quot;    Gen. Brent Scowcroft, former White House national security adviser, said, &quot;The significance of this latest Moscow talk is that Mikhail Gorbachev is seriously interested in a deal and is increasingly making it hard to refuse.&quot; He added that &quot;the deal is substantially in Moscow's favor.&quot;    James Schlesinger, a former defense secretary, said, &quot;Gorbachev is the ablest Soviet leader on foreign policy since Lenin. He is pitching superbly. One regrets that he is doing it so well for our competition, but one still has to admire the artistry.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev's aim, these officials argue, is to capitalize on the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces, Western Europe's reluctance to increase its defense spending and the region's chronic uncertainties about America's readiness to risk nuclear annihilation in order to defend Europe.    &quot;Gorbachev is in a win-win position,&quot; says one U.S. official. &quot;If he gets a deal, he'll get credit for it, and he'll be left with a superior military position. If there is no agreement, the West will get blamed.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's new proposal, even if it doesn't result in an arms agreement, may achieve other Soviet goals. It could breed difficulties between some European leaders and their voters over how to deal with Moscow, and it could cause strains in the alliance.    Mr. Gorbachev's proposal is to begin new negotiations to abolish all nuclear systems in Europe with ranges between 300 and 600 miles -- called short-range missiles -- within a year after agreement to dismantle all medium-range missiles. Soviet superiority in short-range systems -- 130 vs. none for NATO -- has been the key impediment to an agreement on medium-range missiles. An agreement as framed during Mr. Shultz's talks with Mr. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze would provide for reduction of medium-range warheads on both sides to 100. The Soviets would keep their remaining missiles in Asia, and the U.S. would base its 100 remaining missiles on American soil.    The U.S. and its major allies had hoped for an agreement that would have allowed NATO to deploy short-range missiles to levels equal those of the Soviets. Mr. Gorbachev rejected that proposal and instead suggested the new short-range negotiations where Moscow would remove its missiles to achieve superpower equality at zero short-range missiles.    He also said that upon reaching an agreement on medium-range missiles, he would destroy more than 50 SS-23 missiles placed in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, which Moscow implanted in answer to the 1981 NATO decision to deploy medium-range missiles.    NATO doctrine since the 1960s has called for a so-called &quot;flexible response&quot; to a Soviet attack on Western Europe. That means that NATO would have weapons that would allow it to escalate its response gradually from conventional to nuclear weapons in the European theater and, of course, ultimately to use of U.S.-based strategic nuclear weapons. If all nuclear weapons are removed from Europe, the possibility of a gradual response would be eliminated, leaving Europe dependent on its inferior conventional military strength or a strategic nuclear response from the U.S.    &quot;Gorbachev is well on his way to reversing NATO strategy,&quot; says Gen. Scowcroft. &quot;If he succeeds with this proposal, he will leave us the choice of a conventional defeat or using strategic weapons to defend Europe.&quot;    The Soviet news agency Tass indicated that although there was no specific proposal on the relatively small, so-called battlefield nuclear weapons, Mr. Gorbachev wants to eliminate them, too.    The news agency quoted Mr. Gorbachev as prodding, in an aggressive tone, the U.S. to respond favorably. It reported that Mr. Gorbachev said: &quot;We have told you everything. We have told you even more than you have expected . . . we are prepared to eliminate also battlefield tactical missiles. What are you afraid of?&quot;    By coming here to meet with U.S. allies, Mr. Shultz was seeking to avoid causing the degree of European anxiety triggered last October by the Reykjavik summit, when President Reagan was near signing far-reaching agreements that would have changed the whole Western European security picture without consulting his allies.    Although it is clear that the French and British will oppose the Soviet offer, Mr. Shultz said his talks had &quot;made quite a lot of progress, and perhaps we can see the prospect close at hand for reaching an agreement&quot; on medium-range missiles. &quot;We are talking about matters of extraordinary importance,&quot; the secretary said.    He said, however, that differences remain not only on short-range missiles but also over verification. The Soviets have resisted the strict U.S. verification regimen that would include cables being dropped into the ground at test sites, a method known as Cortex. Instead, they will offer their own verification suggestions during talks in Geneva.    The Soviets must have realized after British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Moscow two weeks ago that it was unlikely the Western alliance would accept a &quot;zero solution&quot; for short-range weapons.    &quot;A world without nuclear weapons,&quot; Mrs. Thatcher said in a speech at the Kremlin, &quot;would be less stable and more dangerous for all of us.&quot;    That has lead many to believe that the Soviets made their offer less because they believe that NATO will accept it than because they view it as a maximalist position that will give them the initiative in arms control.    ---          The Nuclear Arms Balance in Europe            Medium and short-range missiles                Missiles  Warheads  Deployed          Range Medium-range Soviet- controlled       441      1,323    Soviet Union      3,000                                    (270 Europe,      miles                                    171 Asia) NATO             316        316    Belgium,          1,100                                    Britain, Italy,   to                                    W.Germany         1,500                                                      miles Short-range Soviet- controlled     1,565      1,565    Czechoslovakia,   40 to                                    E.Germany,        600                                    Poland, Soviet    miles                                    Union NATO             235        235    Belgium, Britain  70 to                                    Italy,            450                                    Netherlands,      miles                                    W.Germany Note: Figures include missiles that can be fitted withconventional or nuclear warheads.
