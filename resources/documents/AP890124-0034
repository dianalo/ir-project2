The proposal from the guerrillas who have waged war against thegovernment for nine years comes in a document, obtained by TheAssociated Press on Monday, signed by the five senior rebel leaders.   The document was to be made public today at a Mexico City newsconference.   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front havecontended that all five elections held this decade were maneuvers ofthe ``U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project.'' They say thatdespite a civil administration, the armed forces are still the mostpowerful element of government.   The insurgents say the elections, scheduled for March 19, must beput off until Sept. 15 if they are to participate.   The right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena,virtually rejected the guerrilla proposal before it was made public.Arena controls the legislature and is leading in presidential polls.   Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San Salvador and a top Arenaleader, told journalists: ``This is typical of the subversion. Theyattack mercilessly, kill, assassinate, strike, then come along andsay, okay, now we offer negotiations.''   Rene Roldan, vice-presidential candidate of the leftistDemocratic Convergence, said his party endorsed the proposal. ``Ithopes to advance the peace process.''   The Christian Democratic government of President Jose NapoleonDuarte had no immediate comment.   The document says the war's recent escalation ``places before thearmed forces the dilemma of having to carry out genocide and thusprovoke insurrection or wait for governmental power to disintegratecompletely and face insurrection caused by hunger.''   The guerrilla force is estimated at about 7,000 combatants and upto 15,000 militiamen and women. Rebels move freely through andexercise some governmental functions in about one-sixth of thecountry.   Last year, rebels increasingly brought a predominantly rural warto the capital with attacks on major military bases in the city.They also resorted to the use of car bombs and the assassination ofmayors.   The government says those ``terroristic'' tactics demonstrate therebels' relative weakness. Yet 56,000-man army has been unable todefeat the rebels _ despite about $800 million in military aidreceived since 1981 and considerable air power, which the guerrillaslack.   Most military observers say the rebels have almost no chance ofdefeating government forces, and the new proposal may be recognitionthat the military path to power is not viable.   In the document, the rebels acknowledge ``the existence of aninternational situation in which the majority of wars are beingresolved by means of negotiation.''   Expressing a willingness to respect the elections' outcome, theyeffectively dropped their long-standing demand that they share powerin a transitional administration that would pave the way for populargovernment.   The insurgents set the following conditions, besides postponement:   _A halt to what they call the armed forces' ``repression'' oflabor and campesino leaders and of street demonstrations.   _The confinement of military and police personnel to barracks onelection day.   _The awarding of a Central Elections Council seat to theDemocratic Convergence and formation of a watchdog panel toguarantee clean elections.   _Revision of the current electoral code through negotiationsamong all parties.   _Respect for absentee ballots cast by Salvadorans who left thecountry during the war.   _The United States cannot interfere in the electoral process orgive aid to any party.   The guerrilla army, in turn, would promise to:   _Respect political activity of all parties and governmentelection authorities.   _Respect the lives of mayors, unless they performmilitary-related functions.   _Observe a truce beginning two days before elections and endingtwo days after.   _Fully participate in the campaign and election activity. Therebels have boycotted and tried to sabotage previous elections. Theyendorse candidates of the Democratic Convergence, whose leadersmaintain links to the rebel army.   _``The FMLN would accept the legitimacy of the the electoralresult,'' the document says, and respect the continuation of thepresent Christian Democratic government until the elections.   Duarte met with the country's Roman Catholic leder, ArchbishopArturo Rivera Damas, on Monday to disucuss the guerrilla document.The rebels gave Rivera Damas the proposal on Friday in Mexico City.   In the document, the rebels call for ``immediate'' discussionswith the government on the proposal and say the archbishop ``cancontribute to the arrangement of these conversations.''   The document does not mention a halt to fighting other than thefive-day election truce and it was not clear how they thinklegitimate elections can be staged if fighting continues up toelection day.   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians.Politically motivated slayings of civilians by government forces,rightist death squads and the guerrillas rose sharply in 1988 overthe previous year.   Arena trounced incumbents in legislative and municipal electionslast March, and has led the Christian Democrats in recent polls.   Three rounds of guerrilla-government peace talks between 1984 and1987 ended in stalemate. The government last year rejected at leasttwo guerrilla proposals to resume negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
