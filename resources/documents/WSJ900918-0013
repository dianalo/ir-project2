Several North American and European communications makersare readying systems for the corporate market that willeliminate costly wiring and allow workers to keep in touchwhen they are wandering around an office building or afactory floor.   The Federal Communications Commission has askedmanufacturers to submit ideas for office wireless systems,including compatibility standards. The agency also hasapproved many applications from start-up companies forradio-based voice and data-transmission systems. Most ofthese units will encode each signal to prevent overlappingvoices and use &quot;spread spectrum&quot; equipment to scatter thesignals over numerous frequencies, increasing systemcapacity.   Sweden's LM Ericsson has begun selling a phone system inEurope that uses radio-frequency transmission to link tinyphones that can fit in shirt pockets. Engineers at NorthernTelecom of Canada are working on several radio-based systemsthat can be attached to conventional phone systems to addwireless service.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, New York, created a stirrecently when it introduced a version of its Merlinoffice-phone system with cordless handsets. Still, only ahandful of phones can work off a single ATandamp;T system, and thebase of each phone must be wired to the main switch. ATandamp;Tsays its engineers are developing &quot;hybrid&quot; systems that willappear in a couple of years that combine wired and radiotechnology.                                                                                                          CEOs Can Give Snoops   An Earful of Static                                                                                                          MOTOROLA is hoping to cash in on businesses' vulnerabilityto high-tech crime with its secure telephone technology.   The Schaumburg, Ill., company, which already sells phonesto the government that encrypt voice signals, has developed anew unit to market the devices to businesses whose topexecutives want to protect secret recipes or competitivebattle plans.   Motorola's phone, called SECTEL, uses a microprocessor todigitalize voice signals and turn them into a special codethat can only be decoded by a similar phone on the other end.The chip also encodes data-communications signals when apersonal computer is plugged into the back of the phone. Auser pushes a special button on the phone that changes itfrom a normal phone to a &quot;secure&quot; one. After that, aneavesdropper would hear only static.   Motorola has sold more than 85,000 secure phones to thePentagon and other government agencies, but the corporatemarket for its $3,000-plus phone could prove tougher. RobertWade, product marketing manager for Motorola's SecureTelecommunications Business unit, said test-marketing in SanFrancisco and Dallas drew fewer than 30 inquiries frompotential customers last month.                                                                                                          Freeway Dialers May Get   A Lift From Chips Soon                                                                                                          CELLULAR phone systems around the country are poised for amuch-needed capacity boost from digital technology in thenext couple of years. But will all the phones, old and new,be able to talk to each other over the upgraded airwaves?   ATandamp;T and San Diego-based Qualcomm are designing a set ofelectronic chips that can be installed in cellular phonesystems to allow future digital phones, includingpocket-sized models, to communicate over networks that employtwo different kinds of digital-transmission technology.   Dale Stone, department head of cellular system engineeringat ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories, says the chip set should allowphones to switch automatically between &quot;time-divisionmultiple access&quot; networks and higher-capacity &quot;code-divisionmultiple access&quot; networks. Many industry experts believe thatCDMA equipment will be the basis for future systems thataccommodate tens of millions of pocket phones used bypedestrians, while TDMA will be used to handle vehicle-basedcellular phones.   The new chip set will get a big tryout in late 1991 whenATandamp;T and Qualcomm install a network for pocket-phone callingin Manhattan for Nynex's mobile communications unit.                                                                                                          One Bin for Voice Mail,   Electronic Mail and Faxes                                                                                                          NOW that &quot;Fax it to me&quot; is firmly fixed in the corporatelexicon, facsimile developers are seeking new uses for thetechnology.   A potentially huge market will be hybrid products thatbundle document-transmission technology with electronic-mailand voice-mail systems, according to a report from ProbeResearch Inc., a Cedar Knolls, N.J., firm that follows thecommunications and computer markets.   Probe expects 1991 to be the year when voice/fax productsbegin to take off. By 1995, Probe predicts that 14% of allvoice-mail and voice-response systems, a $2 billion-plusindustry, will contain integrated fax equipment for storingand retrieving &quot;fax mail.&quot;   One company, Brooktrout Technology, Wellesley, Mass.,recently landed a patent for its method of blending thetechnologies into a single system. It makes a voice/faxsystem that the Weather Fax, Maynard, Mass., uses to turnNational Weather Service information into charts, which arethen faxed to a caller who punches in the command on apushbutton phone.   SpectraFAX, Naples, Fla., makes similar voice/fax systems.</TEXT></DOC>
