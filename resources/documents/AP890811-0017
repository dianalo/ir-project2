Bloch is protected frombeing fired or losing his pension while the case against the U.S.diplomat is investigated, an official of the foreign service unionsays.   ``There's a certain amount of due process,'' Charles Schmitz, aState Department diplomat and vice president of the AmericanForeign Service Association, said Thursday.   ``He can be stripped of his pension if he's convicted of treasonor some other high crime.''   The State Department put Bloch, a 30-year foreign serviceofficer, on paid leave from his job June 22. Soon after, the StateDepartment announced that the FBI was investigating him for``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of a foreign intelligenceservice.''   Bloch has not been charged with any crime.   ``The department does not bring charges unless it believes ithas sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonabledoubt that a person is guilty of violating the law,'' JusticeDepartment spokesman David Runkel said Thursday when asked aboutpossible charges against Bloch.   Administration sources have said there is a videotape of Blochpassing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris. That same agentlater was monitored giving Bloch what officials believe was atelephone warning that he was under suspicion.   FBI agents have been interviewing people acquainted with Bloch,asking questions ranging from whether he had a foreign girlfriendto if he was a stamp collector. Bloch reportedly told the FBI thebriefcase contained stamps.   Agents and the news media have monitored Bloch's every move,including walks with his pet poodle. This week, Bloch and hisentourage took a 22-mile trek and on another day camped on a parkbench for a few hours.   Should Bloch be fired, Schmitz said, he would be entitled to anadministrative hearing. That decision could be appealed to afederal court in the District of Columbia.   Bloch's pension would amount to 60 percent of his $77,500 annualsalary.   Pre-trial publicity has jeopardized any chance of a fair trial,Schmitz said.   ``If he's guilty, there's a lot that muddied the case. If he'sinnocent, his reputation has been pilloried in public; his careerhas been in effect terminated,'' he said.   Schmitz described Bloch, whom he said he knew only slightly, as``sturdy, diligent, solemn, solid.''</TEXT></DOC>
