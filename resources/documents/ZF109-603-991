Relyea, vice chancellor, businessaffairs at UCSD.andP;  &quot;It's simply one of those things you have to have to be aquality facility.&quot;andM;Relyea expects the new fiber system to reduce the university's long-distancecosts.andP;  &quot;This agreement consolidates all of our long-distancetelecommunicatons services and will provide significant savings,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;UCSD's commitment to furthering scientific research is world-renowned,&quot; saidHoward Crane, president of MCI's Pacific Division.andP;  &quot;MCI's relationship withthe university gives us the opportunity to demonstrate how we can bring thelatest technological applications to an institution that is on the forefrontof change.&quot;andM;The UCSD-MCI agreement will provide connectivity via high-speed fiber-optictechnology between the SDSC and NSFNET.andP;  Many researchers at more than 2,000locations in the United States and overseas will have the capability to shareand exchange data and graphics with colleagues at remote sites in &quot;real time&quot;(almost instantaneously).andM;The new fiber system also will provide NSFNET with better access to theSDSC's Advanced Scientific Visualization Laboratory (VisLab), wherescientists create three-dimensional, computer-generated models of complex,natural phenomena.andM;By increasing telecommunications speeds, scientists will be allowed to tacklea variety of problems requiring intense calculations and visualization --from the simulation of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions needed topredict long-range climate changes to the modelling of potential drugs tocombat disease, including AIDS.andM;&quot;This enhanced capability keeps us on the leading edge of computationalscience and engineering -- and helps us push that leading edge forward,&quot; saidSidney Karin, director of SDSC.andM;Karin added that he was &quot;looking forward to collaborating with MCI with thenew gigabit CASA network testbed project.&quot;andM;The CASA network is one of five proposed networks being funded with $15.8million by the NSF and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.andP;  Asenvisioned, CASA will connect the SDSC to three other scientific centers viaoptical fiber capable of transmitting information at about one billion bitsper second (1 gigabit).andP;  The other three centers ar Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, California Institute of Technology and the Jet PropolsionLaboratory.andM;MCI is a major telecommunications provider throughout the University ofCalifornia system.andP;  It owns and operates the world's second largestcommunications network, employing advanced fiber optics, digital microwave,satellite and digital switching technologies.andM;SDSC is administered and operated by General Atomics at UCSD.andP;  SDSC wasestablished in cooperation with the NSF in 1985 to provide an intellectualenvironment in support of leading edge computational science and engineering.andO;Thus, while primarily aimed at academia, SDSC welcomes industrialparticipants.andM;Education, training, consulting and collaborative research and developmentefforts are among SDSC's offerings, as well as its unique supercomputerresources.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
