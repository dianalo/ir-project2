(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Alabama policeman who escapedfrom prison 12 years ago while doing time for murder was found inTexas, where he'd been living under an assumed name with adifferent wife and children, authorities said.   The short-order cook known for years in San Antonio as BenFrancis Hurst turned out to be former Lt. Jimmy Ray Hurst, 56,convicted in 1973 of killing his wife's boyfriend, authorities said.   Circuit Judge William Sullivan, who sentenced Hurst to life inprison for shooting Charles ``Cooter'' Mann, said the AlabamaBureau of Investigation told him Hurst's identity had beenconfirmed through fingerprints.   San Antonio police arrested Hurst late Thursday, a little morethan a week after Alabama investigators asked them to watch a housefrom which telephone calls had been placed to his mother, JuliaHurst of Talladega.   A neighbor said Hurst seemed like a model father to the threechildren he adopted when he married Estela Gonzalez Hurst in 1978.   ``You couldn't think Ben would be capable of something likethat. He's very friendly,'' said Linda Lopez. ``It's justincredible.''   Police were uncertain whether his wife knew of Hurst's past.   ``She just couldn't believe it when I called her. She asked meseveral times if I was lying,'' said detective Bob Farley. TheHurst family has an unlisted telephone number in San Antonio.   Hurst and his wife in Talladega had five children, records show.It was unclear whether they remained married.   San Antonio police investigator Richard Moreno said Hurst hadnot made any effort to change his appearance, although he seemed tohave aged well beyond his years while on the run.   He offered no resistance when confronted outside the Denny'srestaurant where he told officers he had worked for the past eightyears.   Evidence in Hurst's 1973 trial showed he lured Mann, 26, to awooded area and shot him in the face. Hurst had been a fugitivesince March 1977, when he made his second escape from an Alabamastate prison.   Hurst was being held without bond on two fugitive warrants. Hewill be returned to Alabama as soon as possible, authorities said.</TEXT></DOC>
