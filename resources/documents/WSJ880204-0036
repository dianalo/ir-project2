The bill, approved 12-3, is given strong prospects for adoption by the full Senate, mainly because it was authored by both Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the committee chairman, and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), the panel's ranking minority member.    Business groups, especially in the retail and trucking industries, oppose it, saying they must use lie detectors to fight theft and drug abuse on the job. Unions and civil liberties groups back the legislation.    The House passed a similar bill last November that would prohibit use of polygraphs by employers, except for pharmaceutical companies and companies testing their security guards. The Reagan administration opposes the House bill, but hasn't taken a position on the Senate version.    The Senate measure would ban about 85% of current polygraph use, by outlawing both pre-employment and random testing of workers. Employers could use polygraphs to investigate &quot;workplace incidents,&quot; such as thefts or accidents, but only when they also file a police report, insurance claim or report to a regulatory agency. </TEXT></DOC>
