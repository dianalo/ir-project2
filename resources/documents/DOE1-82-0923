<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0923 </DOCNO><TEXT>A small superconducting magnetic field coil (useful bore 18 mm diameter,100 mm length) is described which is used in pulsed operation to magnetizeand demagnetize the working substance in a magnetic refrigeration device.Design features are a winding made of special low loss multifilamentaryNbTi conductor with very fine filaments, a coil former and casing madeof non-metallic composite material. The results of loss measurementsfor field pulses up to a maximum value of 3 T with a repetition ratein the 1 Hz range are given and compared with the values predicted bya model calculation. The possibilities of utilizing such coils in magneticrefrigerators are briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
