White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that PresidentBush accepted a Treasury Department recommendation that the ban bewidened, effective immediately.   The action expands the ban to cover all imports of thehigh-powered, rapid-fire weapons, Fitzwater said.   The previous ban, announced in early March, only covered about80 percent of imports, he said.   Fitzwater said the initial ban on such weapons, including theAK-47 assault rifle, was aimed at fostering ``a climate in whichreasonable and well-intended people ... could work out a thoughtfulsolution'' to the proliferation of such weapons.   He said the department was imposing a ban on an additional 24types of guns ``to review their suitability for sporting purposes.''   Among other things, he said, the administration wants to makesure that no foreign manufacturer suffered a needless weakening ofits competitive position in the export market, and so therefore theban was expanded.   ``The president believes that, by working closely with lawenforcement groups, sportsmen, concerned citizen groups andCongress, we can resolve these problems,'' Fitzwater said.   Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms announced theinitial ban on March 14 on the import of the AK-47s and certainsimilar weapons, but said the action could be ``reversible.''   It said the move was necessary to head off an imminent flood ofthe assault weapons into the United States.   Bush earlier had asked federal drug coordinator William Bennettto recommend what should be done about the increasing flow of theweapons. Calls for such a ban had been prompted by scores ofdrug-related shootings and the recent slaying of five Californiaschoolchildren.   Fitzwater said the new action was not guided so much by growingpublic opinion against such weapons as by a desire to make surethat one company did not gain a competitive advantage over anotherthrough the import ban.   ``This is an effort to equalize that matter,'' he said.   The spokesman conceded that today's action still would notaffect the production and distribution of domestically made assaultrifles.   ``There is some unfairness in that those weapons are still beingproduced. Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anythingabout,'' he said.   ``To do anything about domestically manufactured weapons wouldrequire a change in the law,'' Fitzwater said.   He said that the 90-day review of the entire subject ordered byBush on March 15 is progressing.</TEXT></DOC>
