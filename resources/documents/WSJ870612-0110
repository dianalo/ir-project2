When oil prices zoom upward in response to supply cutbacks, producers wallow in cash and spend money on alternative fuels and exotic exploration ventures.    But when prices fall, these experiments are cut back and cost control becomes the goal. It's this see-saw approach that has hampered industry efforts to use technology efficiently. Increasingly, though, oil companies are coming to realize that pursuing technological improvement regardless of oil-price gyrations can pay big dividends longer term.    Consider how computers have worked their way into every phase of the petroleum industry. The machines run refineries, total up credit-card purchases at gasoline stations, design offshore oil platforms and project cash flow for existing fields.    In fact, the oil industry has become the world's largest commercial user of giant supercomputers. &quot;Because they are doing less exploration, it becomes all the more important that they increase the probability of drilling into a productive field,&quot; says a spokesman for Cray Research Inc., a leading maker of supercomputers.    The number-crunching ability of large computers enables oil companies to draw increasingly detailed portraits of underground rock structures.    Seizing on the drop in price for computing power in the 1970s, for instance, the industry has developed so-called 3D processing, which allows explorers to look at three-dimensional versions of features more than two miles beneath the earth's surface.    Some companies specialize in acquiring libraries of primitive seismic data from a generation ago and then re-processing the data through computers, a process something like re-engineering old music recordings to filter out the distortions and static.    One of the most successful computer applications since the end of the last oil boom is the individual exploration workstation, a computer that allows geophysicists to study and manipulate seismic data generated by the supercomputers.    &quot;Up until two or three years ago, geophysicists never had any personal tools other than a calculator,&quot; says Ms. Chiranky of Landmark Graphics. &quot;They sat there with seismic sections (generated by large computers) and colored them in with pencils.&quot;    Oil companies also are updating technologies used to coax oil from shrinking reservoirs. In California, for instance, major producers have refined steam-production technology in order to keep bringing sludgelike heavy crude to the surface.    And in West Texas, oil is being flushed from seemingly depleted fields with carbon dioxide pumped via pipeline from New Mexico and Colorado. At some companies, these techniques have made a big difference: Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., a pioneer in so-called enhanced recovery, now gets 56% of its U.S. production from such methods.    Even after pumping billions of barrels of oil from beneath the earth, geologists and engineers concede they still have much to learn about the basic chemical and geological forces at work in underground reservoirs.    They hope that some of the technology developed for new exploration will give them a better understanding of existing fields and help them capture the largest known quantity of oil in the world -- the oil in existing fields that can't be produced using current technology.
