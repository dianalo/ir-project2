But I havethis year,'' said horticulturalist Mike Thomas of Paw Paw, Mich.   ``In my judgment, there hasn't been a drought like this sincethe '30s,'' North Dakota Gov. George Sinner said last week aftertouring scorched areas of his state.   ``We'll probably starve the grasshoppers to death if we don'tget rain. That's the good part,'' said Ken Solberg, who owns alivestock auction market in Rugby, N.D.   An unusually dry and hot spring is to blame on much of thePlains and Midwest. But in the Southeast, the Tennessee Valley isheading into its fourth dry year.   The West Coast has had two dry winters, especially in themountains where the snowpack supplies much of the region's water,and irrigation districts and municipal systems are adoptingvoluntary or mandatory water saving.   In Georgia, almost every government in the Atlanta area hasrestricted the hours when lawns can be watered and cars washed, andpeople are snitching on neighbors who break the rules. Statewildlife biologist Bill Cooper says coyotes have taken to raidingwatermelon patches in the area.   Indiana Cities Water Corp. threatened to disconnect service tohomeowners who ignored a ban on lawn sprinkling. Communities acrossIllinois also are pleading for conservation.   ``This is supposedly our rainiest season of the year,'' saidforecaster Al Morrison in Chicago, where only 1.77 inches of rainhad fallen since April 7, when 7.74 inches is normal.   Total crop loss won't be known until harvest time. For now, cropdamage is showing up largely in shriveling leaves and plantsstubbier than expected for this time of year.   ``Within the next week, if we don't get rain, our small-graincrop is going to be 75 percent lost,'' said Don Friederich,executive director of the Minnesota Agricultural Stabilization andConservation Service.   In some places, plants never had a chance.   On his tour last week, North Dakota's governor kneeled in dustyfields and dug up wheat and barley kernels that had nevergerminated. What crops had sprouted had grown just a few inches.   In some hard-hit areas of northwestern Ohio, some farmers haveplowed crops under rather than face sharply reduced yields whilestill bearing the costs of fertilizing, said Alan Brugler of the140,000-family Ohio Farm Bureau Federation.   The effects of the heat and lack of rain appear sooner in earlymaturing hay crops.   ``Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. Theyield from the first cutting was way down, and there won't be muchof a second cutting,'' said Don Keyes of the Minnesota AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service. Much of the state has lessthan half normal rain this year.   Dry pastures forced David Rendahl, who farms 2,800 acres nearFillmore, N.D., to let his 70 cows graze clover he was going tosave for the winter, he said. ``That's supposed to be January hay,and I'm eating it now,'' Rendahl said.   The Department of Agriculture is already allowing farmers to cuthay or let animals graze land that was set aside for crop reductionor conservation in struggling counties in Montana, the Dakotas,Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indianaand Ohio.   The grain futures market in Chicago has surged upward as tradersbet on a smaller and smaller harvest. Soybean futures rose 25percent in a month and on Friday broke the $9-a-bushel barrier,highest since late 1983. Oats traded last week up to the dailylimit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _ four of the fivedays.   The only down day of the week was Wednesday when the marketopened sharply lower after reports that parts of Iowa got rain,with more than 5 inches at Coon Rapids and almost 2 at Des Moines.But the showers were spotty and the forecast was for continuedwarm, dry weather.   A report by the state statistical bureau said Iowa pastures wereat their June 1 driest since 1956.   Rain that falls on most of the area between the Rockies and theAppalachians ultimately drains into the Mississippi River, and thewater level has been dropping, the Coast Guard said. The river fellalmost 2 feet on June 5 and 55 barges were reported grounded thenext day near Memphis, Tenn.   ``A lot of the towboat companies are starting to restrict thesize of the tows going through and starting to restrict the draftof the barges,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Tony Buancore of Memphis.   In the Southeast, western North Carolina is in the grip of anear-record drought. State officials say the next two to threeweeks are critical, although it may already be too late to savesome crops.   ``Corn is just laying there. Not enough moisture to germinateit,'' said Buncombe County, N.C., extension agent Bobby Peek.   ``A lot of our wells have gone dry, too,'' Peek said. ``Theyusually come back in winter. But many didn't come back this winter.The few wells we have are now going deeper. Five to six years ago,150 feet was considered pretty deep for a well; now we go twicethat depth.''   Tennessee Valley Authority reservoirs are dwindling, saidspokesman Richard Urban. Through May, the seven-state TennesseeRiver basin got 13.7 inches of rain, against a normal 23 inches.   The worst-hit lake in the TVA region is Fontana Lake in westernNorth Carolina, which is 45 feet below normal, said Urban.Tennessee's Douglas Lake, one of TVA's major tributary storagereservoirs, is 22 feet below normal.   Small-grain production in South Carolina has probably been cutby at least one third by the weather, said Jake Barker, theAnderson County extension service agent. ``Most of our fescuepastures are burned or grazed out; corn is beginning to feel thepressure, and soybean planting hasn't even begun.''   In California, drought plagues a state where water demand isgrowing with the population. San Francisco and Los Angeles haveordered water rationing. Some emergency regulations pack stingingpenalties.   ``February and March were the driest for that period thiscentury in the northern Sierra, which supplies more than half thewater the state uses,'' said Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist at thestate Department of Water Resources. ``That's what put a real holein the water supply picture.''   That lack of snow has also left hydroelectric reservoirs fallingon the Columbia River in Washington, while at the same time watermust be released to help migrating salmon.   Growers, who have been notified that irrigation allotments willbe as low as 35 percent of normal, are planning to use techniqueslearned in the last drought and to pump water from underground,said California Farm Bureau spokesman Mike Henry.   Water storage was estimated in late May at about 80 percent ofnormal in California's 151 largest reservoirs, but that includeslevels of just 47 percent of normal in the five North Lahontanreservoirs in the eastern Sierra.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
