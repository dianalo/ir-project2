Arrangements call for a safe area around the Villa Mansour inthe area of of Beirut's dividing Green Line, which separates Moslemand Christian forces, envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was quoted as sayingby the independent newspaper An-Nahar.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line withregulations, said police will begin patrolling Friday evening.   Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, defying opposition fromChristian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, summoned the 73 survivinglegislators to three consecutive sessions Saturday.   The first session will be to elect a new house speaker, thesecond to ratify an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end thenation's 14-year-old civil war and the third to elect a newpresident.   The peace plan was worked out by 63 parliamentary deputies in 23days of deliberations in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October.   The accord raises the 99 seats of the unicameral house to 108,to be evenly distributed between Moslems and Christians; increasesthe speaker's term to four years and strips the president of theauthority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers.   Under the previous governing arrangement, the Christians heldthe edge in political power.   The plan also called for a partial Syrian military withdrawalfrom Moslem west Beirut and its environs within two years.   The peace plan, according to the constitution, must ratified bya parliamentary session in Lebanon to become legally binding. Butit also must be accepted by the militia leaders to have any effect.   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Christian, rejects the plan because it doesnot include a clear timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000troops.   The accords, however, have won wide support in Lebanese andinternational circles. Syria's Moslem and leftist allies said nomoves would be taken to obstruct its implementation.   The permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ Britian,China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States _ havepraised the peace plan.   Aoun, in a statement released by his press office today,welcomed the statement issued by the five, terming it ``a positivestand.''   Aoun also urged President Bush to reconsider American policy onLebanon. He did not refer to specific elements he wanted changed.   The United States has called the Taif accord a positivedevelopment. It evacuated ambassador John McCarthy and 29 otherAmerican diplomats from Lebanon Sept. 6 after saying securityaround the embassy was inadequate.   Aoun accuses the Syrians of betraying a 1976 peacekeepingmandate from the 22-nation Arab League by siding with Moslemsagainst Christians in the civil war.   Aoun, who heads an interim Christian military cabinet vying forpower with the Moslem government of acting Prime Minister SalimHoss, has threatened to dissolve Parliament to block implementationof the peace plan.</TEXT></DOC>
