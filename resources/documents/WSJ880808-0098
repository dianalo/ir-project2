The group plans to spend at least $180 million over six years, drilling 30 to 40 onshore wells annually, mainly along the Gulf Coast and in Oklahoma but also in the Rocky Mountain region, said oilman and investor Lester Smith, who put the parties together.    This is the second venture involving Mr. Smith and Aeneas Venture Corp., an affiliate of Harvard's endowment fund. Last year Aeneas, several other prominent East Coast universities and the exploration unit of Brooklyn Union Gas Co., a New York gas utility, entered into a $250 million offshore exploration and development venture.    Both the earlier venture and the new one primarily will drill for natural gas, betting that the depressed gas prices of the past few years will rise. U.S. natural gas production is outstripping discoveries of reserves, so most industry officials expect prices to rise eventually.    &quot;But the success is not at all dependent on upward changes in gas prices,&quot; said Scott Sperling, a partner in Harvard Management Co. who oversees its energy investments. Harvard expects a 15% minimum rate of return because it thinks oil and gas properties currently are inexpensive and drilling costs are &quot;extraordinarily low,&quot; Mr. Sperling said.    Of course, if gas prices rise sharply, &quot;The returns go out the window,&quot; Mr. Smith said. He added that Harvard often takes a &quot;contrarian&quot; investment approach. Of Aeneas's $1 billion of total market value and commitments, about $200 million is invested or committed to oil and gas. Venture capital represents about half the total.    &quot;We've looked at 300 to 350 investment situations&quot; in oil and gas, Mr. Sperling said. &quot;This is the fourth one we've made.&quot;    In the latest drilling program, Mr. Cullen will be the operator and invest roughly 25%, or $45 million. The remainder comes from Invexco Inc., in which Mr. Sperling is chairman and Mr. Smith president. Through Invexco, Harvard will invest the largest share, about $64 million, Mr. Smith will put up about $7 million and a number of institutional investors and others the rest.    Mr. Cullen is grandson of famed wildcatter Hugh Roy Cullen, who built the family empire into one of the larger independent oil companies in the country. The family's closely held Quintana Petroleum Corp. will operate the properties, which it does for the family and other oil and gas producers.    Because of the downturn in the energy business, Mr. Cullen, like other independents, has had to sharply curtail operations, particularly exploration. While Mr. Cullen said he was &quot;surprised&quot; to hear of Harvard's interest, he described the university as an attractive partner. &quot;They have the funds,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
