The special attention hasbeen paid to functions which the gas stores have to perform in a gasdelivery system. The gas power distribution as well as gas demand andconsumption as a time functions has been characterized and discussed.Provided are algorithms of programming the optimum gas injection intogas stores and utilization of gas reservoir performance during the excesspower period /summer/.</TEXT></DOC>
