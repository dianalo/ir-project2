Applecomputer is one of the popular machines used for scientific and engineeringapplications. Presenting output from computers in a neat and easy toread form is very important. Languages like FORTRAN have utility command'FORMAT' which takes care of the formatting of the output in user-definedform. In some versions of BASIC a PRINT USING facility is available butit is not as powerful as the FORTRAN statement 'FORMAT'. Applesoft basicdoes not have even this PRINT USING command. Programmers have to writetheir own program segments to handle output formatting in Applesoft BASIC.Generally, such user written programs are of limited use as they cannotbe used easily with other programs. A general purpose and easily transportablesubroutine in Applesoft BASIC is presented here for handling output formattingin user-defined structure. The subroutine is nearly as powerful as theFORMAT statement in FORTRAN. It can also be used in other versions ofBASIC with very little modifications. 3 tables, 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
