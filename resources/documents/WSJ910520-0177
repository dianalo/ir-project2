However, hesaid he hasn't decided to take any action on such a proposal.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Mitchell's view is surprising given his -- and otherDemocratic leaders'strong support for the strict limits oflast year's multiyear deficit-reduction package. But hisviews are significant given his standing in Congress, andthey could gain a broader following if the economy doesn'timprove.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) saidyesterday on CBS News's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that he and otherDemocratic leaders from both houses of Congress plan toannounce tomorrow their plans to pursue a tax cut for themiddle class, improvements in the unemployment compensationsystem and changes in health care. The Democrats will outlinegoals rather than unveiling detailed legislative proposals,aides said.   Mr. Mitchell said that others in his party are adamantabout adhering to the budget accord, which requires eithertax increases or spending cuts to pay for any tax reductions.And he said paying for a tax cut with a tax increase onupper-income Americans continues to be an option with him.   Sen. Mitchell has been a leading advocate of reducingtaxes for the middle class and this year was a key supporterof Sen. Daniel Moynihan's proposal to cut the Social Securitypayroll tax. But he was frustrated in achieving his goal whenthe Moynihan plan lost a test vote in the Senate amidconcerns that the cut might jeopardize the solvency of theSocial Security trust fund.   Since then, Democrats have privately discussed cuttingtaxes for the middle class by as much as $50 billion in asingle year as a way to stimulate the economy. Sen. Mitchellsaid he isn't advocating any particular figure.   Sen. Mitchell said that cutting taxes outright as a way ofboosting economic activity should be considered, especiallyif the economic downturn continues. &quot;We are in a severeeconomic recession,&quot; he said, but President Bush &quot;has noprogram&quot; to deal with it. However, Mr. Mitchell said, theDemocrats will have one.   A decision to embrace an unpaid-for tax cut will bedetermined by the depth of the recession and the Democrats'ability to reach a political consensus on the measure, Sen.Mitchell said.   Other Democratic leaders have also been raising thepossibility of making fiscal changes on an &quot;emergency&quot; basisin the face of the continued recession. Chairman James Sasser(D., Tenn.), of the Senate Budget Committee, for example, hassaid that legislation to expand unemployment benefits mightbe moved forward without offsetting tax increases under theemergency provisions of the budget law.   The pay-as-you-go requirement in last year's budget pacthas served to impede Democrats' interest in expanding socialspending or targeting tax relief to the middle class. But therestrictions can be waived during a recession or in the caseof emergency. The Senate has twice voted to keep the budgetaccord intact despite the recession. But Sen. Sasser haswarned that future votes to keep the budget accord togetherwould be imperiled if there weren't some &quot;flexibility.&quot;   Chairmen of the tax-writing panels in the House and Senatehave taken a tougher stand. Senate Finance Committee ChairmanLloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) helped defeat the Moynihan plan byarguing that it would widen the budget deficit. And ChairmanDan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Meanscommittee has not only backed careful adherence to the budgetagreement, but has even called for additional deficit-cuttingaction.</TEXT></DOC>
