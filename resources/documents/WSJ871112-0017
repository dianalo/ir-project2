But he doesn't carry that criticism as far as some Reagan administration conservatives do.    &quot;If even the text of the Constitution is up for grabs every week, then we're really in trouble,&quot; Judge Kennedy said in a panel discussion in Hawaii last August. &quot;There must be some demonstrated historical link between the rule being advanced in the court and the announced declarations and language of the framers,&quot; he said.    The panel discussion, which offers a glimpse of Judge Kennedy's approach to the Constitution, was taped by the staff of the federal appeals court in San Francisco, and a copy of the tape was made available to The Wall Street Journal.    Judge Kennedy's comments during the discussion verify his credentials as a conservative judge. But he doesn't advocate anything near the strict adherence to the &quot;original intent&quot; of the framers, a belief that has become a hallmark of Attorney General Edwin Meese and other strict conservatives.    For example, he suggested that besides the Constitution, itself, the courts and government must also heed an &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; that &quot;consists of our ethical culture, our shared beliefs, our common vision. . . .&quot; He said this unwritten code is &quot;an additional brake, an additional restraint&quot; on government powers.    While he didn't specify how this unwritten code works, the concept suggests a belief that there are natural rights in the U.S. that aren't enumerated in the Constitution but that must be respected by all branches of government. These could include the right to privacy. It was Judge Robert Bork's failure to define his view of such natural or fundamental rights, particularly privacy, that hastened his defeat in the Senate.    Judge Kennedy's view, says Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, &quot;distinguishes him from Bork and also from (Chief Justice William) Rehnquist. He appears to have an even-handed willingness to find limits not only on judicial power, but on government authority as well.&quot;    In the same panel discussion, it was noted that some adherents to &quot;original intent&quot; have trouble with the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 school desegregation case, Brown vs. Board of Education. Some of them question whether the Congress that passed the 14th Amendment, guaranteeing &quot;equal protection of the laws,&quot; intended to desegregate school systems.    But Judge Kennedy said he has no problems with the Brown decision: &quot;I embrace it. . . . The only thing wrong with Brown is it wasn't decided 80 years earlier.&quot; He criticized the Supreme Court's 1896 decision upholding &quot;separate, but equal&quot; facilities for blacks, saying it &quot;was wrong when it was decided.&quot;    He warned that judicial power must be subject to limits. &quot;Judicial power without rational restraints,&quot; he said, &quot;is simply the exercise of raw will, the arrogance of power, abuse of office.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
