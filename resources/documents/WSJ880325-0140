The Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society and National Wildlife Federation are supporting the request of Crop Genetics International Corp. to raise what the Hanover, Md.-based concern and the EPA say would be the first crop with built-in pesticidal bacteria.    Opponents include Jeremy Rifkin, one of the nation's most vocal critics of biotechnology.    EPA scientists say they will announce a preliminary decision today or early next week. A final decision is planned May 6.    Charles Benrook, chief agricultural expert for the National Academy of Sciences, an independent scientific society, is scheduled to give the plan a boost by appearing with its backers at a news conference today. While a rash of proposals for experiments with genetically engineered crops has been submitted to regulators for this summer, Mr. Benrook calls this &quot;the first one with the potential for wide commercial use.&quot;    Crop Genetics wants to raise two acres of corn in Maryland. It says it plans to raise another acre in France regardless of the EPA's decision but subject to French government approval. It wants to inject into the seedlings a microbe called Cxc, which lives inside certain plants and will have been altered with a gene from a one-celled bacterium called Bt. Bt produces a protein lethal to some caterpillars, including the corn borer. For commercial purposes, seeds would be pre-injected with the altered Cxc before sale to farmers.    Mr. Benrook says the company will have &quot;a heavy burden . . . to overcome to convince people&quot; that the product is safe. But if the experimental crop proves the technique is safe, Crop Genetics hopes the product would replace a chemical pesticide trade it estimates at $240 million a year for corn.    The company says this would eliminate half of all corn-crop spraying with chemical pesticides that have been blamed for the deaths of millions of birds, among other things. Crop Genetics says it is working on genetic alteration that would also kill two other corn pests and eliminate the need for spraying entirely. The Cxc would live in a part of the corn plant the pests inhabit, but not reach the edible grain, the company says.    Mr. Rifkin argues that the company has asked a waiver on many regulatory tests which he calls necessary to confirm its claims that Bt isn't dangerous to animal life. He also says the company is too close to its regulators -- one branch of the Agriculture Department must pass on the project, while another is co-owner of one of the planned corn fields. He adds that the altered Cxc could spread from corn to various weeds whose growth is controlled by pests the Bt protein might kill, thus creating serious weed problems. </TEXT></DOC>
