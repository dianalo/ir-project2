A campaign spokeswoman for Bush, the Republican presidentialnominee, termed the remarks by Abolhassan Bani-Sadr ``absolutelyfalse.''   Bani-Sadr said Tuesday he did not know if the shipment ofweapons was related to the release Monday of Mithileshwar Singh, a60-year-old Indian professor and legal U.S. resident.   ``There has been a delivery of arms to Iran,'' he said. ``Doesthat have something to do with the release? I don't know.'' He gaveno details of the purported arms transfer.   The disclosure of clandestine arms sales to Iran, aimed atsecuring the release of the hostages during 1985 and 1986, led tothe Iran-Contra affair. It was the Reagan's administration's worstforeign policy controversy.   Bani-Sadr said that according to his information, a man namedRichard Lawless negotiated Singh's release.   ``It seems he (Lawless) has denied it,'' Bani-Sadr said inParis, where he lives in exile. ``I am trying to verify it.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington:``There is a fellow named Lawless. He is over there. What he's upto, nobody knows. But he doesn't represent the United States ... Hedoes not represent the vice president or the president or anybodyelse.''   ``His charges are not true _ from top to bottom,'' Fitzwatersaid today. ``Bani-Sadr's full of beans.''   The presidential spokesman also rejected for the second day in arow any government connection with Lawless. ``He's not operatingunder our instructions,'' Fitzwater said.   Bani-Sadr said the prior channel for contacts between the UnitedStates and Iran no longer works and a new one has just beencreated. He did not elaborate but said a new intermediary had justleft for the United States.   He would not identify the intermediary either by name ornationality, saying he did not want to ruin the chances of morehostage releases.   Sixteen hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held byMoslem extremists loyal to Iran.   Bani-Sadr said Bush has been dealing since last February withHashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament. He saidrepresentatives of both Bush and Democratic presidential nomineeMichael Dukakis have been in Iran for talks.   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said in Washington, ``That's nottrue. It's preposterous.''   Bani-Sadr, who fled Iran in 1981, said intense efforts to freehostages were under way and that he has been told Bush was tryingvery hard to work out the release of American hostages in earlyOctober.   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said in Washington: ``Thoseassertions are absolutely false. Absolutely no one is representingthe vice president, the office of the vice president or thecampaign in any dealings with the hostages, or any other dealingswith Iran.''   The Reagan administration has steadfastly denied that it hasundertaken any talks directly with Iranian officials to get thehostages released.   Bani-Sadr said Iran wants the release of Iranian assets frozenin the United States.   Iran has filed claims before a joint U.S.-Iranian claimstribunal for $12 billion in military equipment frozen as a resultof the 1979 Iranian revolution. Tehran also seeks release ofbillions of Iranian funds frozen in U.S. banks after seizure of 52hostages at the U.S. embassy in 1979.   U.S. officials say $9 billion in financial assets have eitherbeen returned to Iran or paid to its creditors.</TEXT></DOC>
