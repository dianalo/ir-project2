Although the invader was quicklyneutralized, &quot;we realized this was a real menace,&quot; recallsone of the Soviet defenders.   The intruder was a &quot;virus,&quot; a software program designed toinfiltrate a computer's memory and disrupt the system, thatsomehow got into the center's personal computers.</LP><TEXT>   The event alarmed Soviet computer scientists; thoughcommon in the West, this form of computer sabotage had beenlittle known in the East. After all, a computer virus needscomputers -- and computers haven't exactly been plentifulhere.   But the number of Soviet computers is growing, and withthem are beginning to appear viruses and other hazardsfamiliar in Western computing. Since 1988, Soviet computerscientists have recorded 15 virus attacks around theircountry. Soviet media have even reported on the disgruntledVolga Auto Works employee who sabotaged the computer runninga car-production line.   To cope, a tiny industry is emerging here, much as in theWest, to offer protection for harried computer managers.   After years of unconcern, &quot;there's a lot of interest&quot; inviruses now among Soviet computer scientists, says Prof.Seymour Goodman, a specialist on Soviet computing at theUniversity of Arizona. While Soviet expertise in this area isstill limited, he notes, &quot;they seem to sense it's somethingthey ought to know about.&quot;   Even the KGB is interested. One Soviet computer scientistsays he was questioned by his country's intelligence service,which wondered if the viruses could be Western sabotage. Hetold them that was implausible -- but that their suspicionswere understandable.   The U.S. Army's Center for Signals Warfare recentlyannounced plans to study the feasibility of computer-viruswarfare. The $50,000 technical study isn't aimed specificallyat the Soviet Union or any other country, says RichardPoisel, the center's research chief. But he adds, though hedoesn't know for sure, that the Soviet military may havebegun similar studies.   Viruses appeared in the U.S. in the early 1980s. Initiallya hackers' diversion, they can be as innocuous as a programthat flashes a rude message on the monitor or as destructiveas one that garbles a computer's memory. Typically, theyescape notice as part of a legitimate program, and theyspread from computer to computer on floppy disks or overelectronic networks.   Moscow once insisted that computer viruses were a uniquelyWestern problem. Computer hackers, mischievous or not, arerare in the Soviet Union, as are the machines themselves (thecountry has at most one million personal computers -- aboutas many as in one average U.S. state). Big computer networks,a common vector for viruses in the West, are rarer still.   Besides, computers occupied until recently a sacrosanctplace in Kremlin ideology: They were regarded as space-agemanagement tools that would perfect communism, giving Sovietcentral planners unprecedented power to monitor and directthe nation's economy.   Thus, the awakening was a rude one. &quot;We have read someincredible stories of computer viruses causing billions ofdollars of losses to computer centers in some remotecapitalist countries, but we never took them seriously,&quot;wrote several researchers at the U.S.S.R. Academy ofScience's Program Systems Institute, in an article publishedin an academy journal.   The big computer-research institute was the first todiscover that the Soviet Union isn't immune to viruses. Inthe summer of 1988, it was running a computer trainingfacility outside Moscow for bright youngsters from 20countries. One personal computer began to malfunction,apparently stuck on a command to keep restarting itself.Subsequent research found that the cause was a virus,imported inadvertently on a floppy disk carried by one of theforeign computer students. Institute specialists, whoexpunged the virus after 18 hours, found the experiencedisturbing. &quot;The PC seemed to have a will of its own,&quot; thescientists wrote. &quot;We felt like doctors confronted with anunknown disease.&quot;   Sergei Abramov, an institute official interviewed here,says that since then he and his colleagues have recorded 14other cases of virus attack in the Soviet Union. The targetsincluded an institute that designs civilian-aircraft engines,and another that designs components for the Soviets' ES rangeof mainframe computers. Almost all the viruses whose originscould be traced emanated from the West. One, however, camefrom Bulgaria. Called Dark Avenger, it was carried into theSoviet Union by a Soviet marine-research vessel plying theBlack Sea near Bulgaria; the ship's computers were usingfloppy disks obtained locally.   In response, the country's computer labs and a few privatecooperatives have begun mobilizing. Already, computerspecialists say, as many as 150 &quot;anti-virus&quot; programs arecirculating in the Soviet Union -- some pirated from theWest, others designed locally.   But sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease. Anearly version of an anti-virus program designed by Mr.Abramov's colleagues was itself found to be inadvertentlycarrying a virus. The researchers didn't intend the programfor release, but in a country where software piracy abounds,the virus quickly spread outside the lab on a pirated floppydisk.   Now, Mr. Abramov explains, he can track the piratedversion's spread around the Soviet Union by reports of itsaccompanying virus. &quot;The last time we saw it,&quot; he says, &quot;wasin Vladivostok.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
