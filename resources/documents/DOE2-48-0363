Previous methods [cement bond logs (CBL's)]that used a low-frequency ({approx_equal} 20 x 10/sup 3/-recycle/sec[{approx_equal} 20-kHz]) acoustic signal and a single-transmitter/dual-receivercombination suffered from inherent measurement problems. To eliminateseveral of the CBL problems a new dual-transmitter/multireceiver acousticmeasurement tool, the ratio bond tool (RBT), has been introduced. TheRBT measures attenuation directly through ratiometric techniques, isself-calibrating, and is much less sensitive to tool centralization.For cement evaluation across &quot;fast formation&quot; intervals, a 1-ft [0.33-m]-spaced transmitter/receiver signal amplitude is measured. A &quot;loggingwell&quot; has been constructed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) to evaluate downhole tool response to cement channels. This testwell was constructed with numerous sizes and weights of casings and hasspecially constructed flaws on the casing circumference to produce channelsof variable lengths and widths. A detailed analysis of the ability ofthe CBL, RBT, and PET logs to detect these channels is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
