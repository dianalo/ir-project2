(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of unused medical needlesthat washed ashore along Palm Beach County were made for theDepartment of Defense and probably were dropped overboard by a U.S.Navy ship, an official said.   ``They more than likely came from one of our Atlantic fleetunits,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a spokesman at fleetheadquarters in Norfolk, Va.   He could not say why new needles would have been dumpedoverboard.   The needles had the same lot number as more than 2,000 needlesfound in September along 10 miles of Flagler County beach south ofSt. Augustine, state health officials said Friday.   The needles, found Thursday along a six-mile stretch ofoceanfront from Riviera Beach to Palm Beach, were still in theirprotective plastic sheaths. No syringes were found.   Burnett said other defense units had access to the needles fromthe lot, so he could not be certain the Navy was at fault.   The Atlantic fleet rewrote its regulations in September afterfive garbage bags of medical waste traced to Navy ships washed upon North Carolina beaches in August, Burnett said. With fewexceptions, medical waste now must be held aboard ship and disposedof in port.</TEXT></DOC>
