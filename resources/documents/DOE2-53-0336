Results of regression analysis on the basis ofretail data lead to the conclusion that consumers were more liberal intheir energy use in the period with low prices than in the period withhigher prices. However, the increase in demand for energy performanceis considerably smaller than the potential energy saving which wouldresult from the use of a modern standard of installation. It is unlikely,in spite of lower prices, that energy consumption will ever again reachits former higher level. On the other hand it is equally unlikely thatinstallations in older buildings will be altered with a view to savingenergy. Our results indicate that consumer behaviour is very stable inthis area.</TEXT></DOC>
