But in a reversal of stereotypes, it was the Japanese kids whobrought the marionette and robot on skis, and the Americans whoproduced door guards, portable seat belts and diapers with built-indisposable bags.   The meeting was arranged by a program to spur creativity amongAmerican students called ``Invent America!'' and the JapanInstitution of Invention and Innovation, which has sponsoredcompetitions for Japanese schoolchildren since 1941.   The Japanese students' inventions included the mechanizedmarionette of Takakiyo Katami, 11, of Gufu City; a robot that canslalom back and forth on skis by Yasushi Nishiyama, 15, of Nagoya;and an illuminated constellation model made from 2,000 opticalfibers by Takahiro Tsurita, 14, of Toyota City.   Tomoyuki Imura, 15, of Miki City, Japan, came up with a ballretriever that consists of several tennis cans open at both endsand taped together.   Sally Mallison, 12, of Wilmington, Del., who devised her``Bag-A-Diap'' to help her parents cope with messy diapers on cartrips, said, ``I think from the Japanese I've learned thatinventions can be mechanical and they can also be ... like minewhere they don't have anything mechanical to do with them.''   Yasushi Nishiyama, maker of the slalom robot, said through aninterpreter, ``After observing all these inventions I noticeJapanese students' inventions seem to be more like toys, somethingkids can play with.''   Most of the Americans' inventions, he added, seemed ``morepractical, something in your daily life that you can actually use.''   How does that square with the image Americans have of Japanesestudents spending endless hours in school or studying?   ``There are some people who study hard, but there are some whojust enjoy playing,'' Nishiyama said. ``They stay away from thatwork. Instead, they try to create something more interesting sothey can enjoy themselves.''   Two of the young Japanese inventors' devices did have apractical tilt. Hiroshi Aoyagi, 12, of Tokamachi, built a door thatcan slide up or swing out.   And Yoshitaka Tanimoto, 13, of Takayama City, won top honors,the Prime Minister's Prize, for inventing a device to help hisgrandfather regain use of his hand after a stroke. Tanimoto's handrehabilitation machine consists of two crescent shaped handlesattached by strong rubber bands that can be stretched apart.   The Americans, all honored last June in an Invent Americacompetition, included Maurice Scales, 8, of Suitland, Md., who cameup with a Plexiglas shield to keep doors from slamming on hissister's fingers; the portable seat belt for school buses byMichelle Cardin, 10, of Fairfield, Conn.; an artificial reef tohelp young fish by Brian Lloyd, 15, of Jacksonville, Fla.; and ascheme for solar energy from space by Sachin Patel, 7, of Flatonia,Texas.   The U.S. Patent Model Foundation launched Invent America inDecember 1986 with corporate financing and moral support from theReagan administration. It expects 8 million students in 35,000 U.S.elementary schools to take part in this year's competition.   Kazuhiko Hoshino, president of the Japan Institute of Inventionand Innovation, said the visit will help the Japanese youths``develop new ideas and high creativity.''   ``In order to cope with the current trend towardinternationalization, we consider it important for Japanese schoolstudents to visit overseas at every opportunity,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
