The plan -- submitted by the Chicago Board OptionsExchange and the New York, American and Pacific stockexchanges -- would create electronic links of optionstrading, allowing options to be bought and sold at the bestprice on any exchange, much like stocks. The plan is likelyto keep the SEC on schedule for its target of January for anew options-trading system.</LP><TEXT>   In January, the SEC ordered the exchanges to come up witha plan by tomorrow to link the markets and allow freeroptions trading. Currently, most options are allocated by alottery system to a single exchange and can be traded onlythrough that market. That provides lucrative exclusivefranchises for the exchanges.   The SEC has contended that those monopolies don't benefitthe consumer. But the exchanges fought the plan for years,arguing that allowing several exchanges to list the sameoptions would reduce liquidity in the market. Moreover, thesmaller exchanges worried that linking the markets would putthem at a competitive disadvantage.   &quot;We're very encouraged,&quot; said SEC Chairman RichardBreeden. &quot;We have concluded that it is unquestionablyfeasible. The next step now is moving toward implementation.&quot;   The four exchanges submitted their plan, called PublicInvestors Privileged Express, or PIPE, which now appears tobe the front-runner. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange,however, offered a different plan, called Auction IntermarketSystem, or AIMS.   The SEC said the plans are under review. But the next stepis likely to be an attempt by agency staffers to bridge thedifferences between the two plans. If that doesn't work, theagency has statutory authority to approve any proposal -- orwrite its own. Staffers appear to be leaning toward acceptingthe PIPE plan. &quot;We see an ability for the type of linkageproposed by the four exchanges,&quot; said Richard Ketchum, SECmarket regulation director.   The agency would then ask the exchanges to file a jointrule proposal, which would then be released for publiccomment. After the comment period, the SEC could grant finalapproval for the plan.   Options give a holder the right, but not the obligation,to trade a security at a predetermined price within a setperiod.   In January, the SEC permitted any options exchange totrade options on any exchange-traded stock as long as noother market was trading options on the stock and it metcertain requirements in net income, number of shareholdersand price. More than one exchange can trade stocks options onany over-the-counter stock that meets regulatory rules.   The SEC could decide by tomorrow to phase in anotherinterim step, allowing an exchange to trade options on amaximum of 10 issues that have options trading elsewhere.However, the SEC has set a target of Jan. 21, 1991, toeliminate all exclusive trading privileges.   Some industry observers expect that to lead to exchangesleaving the options business or merging. &quot;There is not enoughbusiness to go around for five options exchanges,&quot; saidRichard Donsky, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s director ofoptions. &quot;I guarantee that one year after multiple listing isfully adopted there won't be five exchanges.&quot;   The PIPE and AIMS proposals are identical on many pointsbut differ in one key area -- time priority. This featureonly comes into play when more than one exchange is showingthe same price for an option. Under the Philadelphia plan,the order would automatically go to the exchange that hadposted that price first. Under the PIPE plan, however, theexchange where the order was first directed would have achance to improve its quote and fill the order.   Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia StockExchange, says AIMS provides an incentive for market makersto show their best price early. &quot;That's clearly the best forthe public investor,&quot; he said.   But CBOE President Charles Henry said PIPE will allowbrokerage firms to route their orders to a selected exchange.&quot;They will select an exchange based on price, liquidity andthe charges imposed by the exchanges for filling the order,&quot;he said.   Mr. Giordano said he offered a compromise in a recentletter to the SEC. He said that the Philadelphia exchangewould be willing to accept a system that doesn't incorporatetime priority as long as the SEC makes clear that the systemwould be only an evolutionary step toward one that does. Inaddition, he wants the system to be used to trade newlylisted options only. Advocates for both plans say that 18months will be needed to create an operational system.   Andrew Schwarz, senior partner in a specialist firm on theAmex, said he thinks the SEC will accept the compromise thatthe Philadelphia exchange has offered because it is the pathof least resistance. &quot;Everybody is unhappy and happy withparts of the proposal,&quot; he said. &quot;That tells me it isprobably the right one.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
