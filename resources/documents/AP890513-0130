(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Representatives of striking guards atLos Alamos National Laboratory agreed to a contract with thefacility's security contractor on Saturday in an attempt to end atwo month-old walkout.   ``It's a very good contract. We're very happy with it,'' saidBen Huff, spokesman for the International Guards Union of AmericaLocal 69.   About 250 security inspectors went on strike March 13,protesting Mason andamp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co.'s disciplinary policiesand other working conditions at the government complex where theatomic bomb was developed during World War II and where militaryresearch is still done.   Leonard Carter, Mason andamp; Hanger's contract manager, said he wassatisfied with the pact, which was completed about 4 a.m. after an18-hour negotiating session.   ``There's nothing in there that I can't live with,'' he said.   Union officials declined to discuss specifics of the contractuntil it is ratified, but Huff said the proposal addressed most ofthe guards' major concerns, including overtime, discipline and sickleave.   Carol Oppenheimer, a Santa Fe attorney who helped represent theunion, said a back-to-work pact still must be negotiated, and talkson that would take place Monday and Tuesday.   The union is slated to meet Wednesday for a ratification vote,which requires a two-thirds majority. Huff said he expected about245 of the 250 guards to return to work.   On Thursday, Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Jeff Bingaman,D-N.M., asked the General Accounting Office to study whether thesecurity force should consist of federal employees rather than aDepartment of Energy contractor.   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House subcommitteethat oversees the DOE, also asked for a GAO investigation ofdefense-installation security at the request of Rep. BillRichardson, D-N.M.   The guards have been replaced by non-union workers andsupervisors during the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
