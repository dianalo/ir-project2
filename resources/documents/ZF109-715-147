 And as if that wasn't difficult enough,somebody then has to take the specification and actually write program codethat people are going to use in real life.andP;  In a fast changing businessworld, Magic is intended to solve this not so simple dilemma.andP;  Does it liveup to its name?andM;Well, it's certainly an excellent way of building applications for use wherespeed of delivery is the key factor.andP;  I've built my own system, for managingcontractors time-sheets and the subsequent billing of clients, with Magic.andP;  Ireckon that in terms of build time it took about the same time as producingthe identical application in DataEase v4.andP;  When I did this, however, I knewDataEase inside out yet had been working with Magic for less than a week.andM;Magic is grandly described as 'Computer Aided Programming'.andP;  What this reallymeans is that if you can define what has to be done in terms that Magicunderstands, then this product takes care of how it's done.andM;It's not that easy, but an awful lot of drudgery is removed, if you (thesystem builder) can get the requirements and design right.andP;  It doesn'tgenerate code in a form that you or I would recognise, but is rather asophisticated, highly adaptable parameter-driven database.andP;  This produces atrade-off, because you have to have a run-time system for every PC that'sgoing to use your application.andM;First, let's get the bad news about Magic out of the way because the rest ismostly good.andP;  It seems that the message about F1 and HELP hasn't reached theprogrammers of this system yet -- they use F10.andP;  Similarly, the functionyou'd expect for the Escape key is mapped onto F9.andP;  WordPerfect may be ableto get away with nonsense like this, but these guys can't -- the next releaseneeds to solve this problem.andM;The copy protection device is another mistake.andP;  It's a dongle about twoinches long that has to be fitted to the parallel port on the back of yourPC.andP;  A few years ago that might have been more acceptable, but in the age offitted office furniture with cable ducts in small spaces, all a dongle doesis make the footprint of your PC bigger.andP;  It also makes the port morevulnerable to damage.andM;The system is very easy to install and a simple DOS COPY of the two3-1/2-inch disks does just fine.andP;  There's no additional install procedure andto assume this level of DOS expertise is OK given the likely users of Magic.andO;It doesn't require any fancy hardware--a straightforward IBM-compatible willdo as long as you have a hard disk and 640Kb of memory.andM;There's no provision for selecting your favourite printer, as there aren'tany drivers -- it's down to you as a developer to put the right codes intoyour application.andP;  In this respect, Magic is no different to programs likeClipper and dBase.andM;The system is basically menu and function key driven and makes heavy use of'fill in the blanks' information tables.andP;  As you fill in the tables, Magictranslates that into programming information.andP;  You don't have to concernyourself with opening and closing files and the other usual minutiae ofprogramming, those things are implicit and are handled entirely by Magic.andM;Starting at the Magic system menu, your first task is to tell Magic the nameand a few other details about your application or subsystem.andP;  You get anoption list from the F1 key, hit Enter to pick 'menu maitenance' and thenfill in the blanks on the form.andP;  All that's required at this level is toenter the system name and the two-letter prefix that will be used to identifyyour programs and the data files.andM;One advantage of this approach is that it's quite possible to build separateapplications that use a common set of data files.andM;For example, one application might be a pure stock control and orderprocessing application, and the other a financial one which uses the samefiles, with a third as a sales information system.andP;  This is all perfectlyfeasible on a network and has an additional advantage for developers in beingable to phase in the delivery of applications to customers.andM;As soon as the application has been named and stored, the real power of Magicbecomes apparent.andP;  Using that F1 (Options) key brings up the menu where allthe real work is done: Items 2 and 3 handle data definition.andP;  You can skipitem 2 if you must, but it's bad practice and it'll save you hassle if you douse it.andM;The 'Type Dictionary' is a smart way of defining all the field definitions ina generic format just once.andP;  The description is just text; Attr(ibute) can beAlpha, Numeric, Date, Time, Logical and Message.andP;  The 'picture' data can befilled in directly, or by using the zoom key (F5), it can be written bysetting number switches to &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;N&quot;.andP;  It's quick and easy with enough powerto be used effectively.andM;Defining which fields belong in which files is done in the data dictionaryand works in a similar way -- just fill in the blanks and pick the fieldsfrom the Type Dictionary.andM;It's down at the file level that you define the keys to be used.andP;  They can beon single fields or more and can be set to 'unique' or not.andP;  So no matter howmany times a particular field definition is going to be used, in Magic youonly have to specify it once and then just say where it's used.andM;I can hear all the programmers saying 'So what?'.andP;  Well, just suppose thatyou system had to have a field that was a product code 5 digits long which isused all over the system and your client or boss says 'Oh, by the way, thatproduct code is now six digits'.andM;The isn't a problem for you in Magic; just make the change in the TypeDictionary and all occurrences of that field type are updated in the DataDictionary.andM;Even more important, it also applies those changes to the programs, dataentry forms and reports.andP;  That's a mighty power feature.andM;I tested the difference between this method and doing it by hand with fivefiles and 18 programs.andP;  The easy way takes about one minute, and the old wayjust over an hour.andP;  Imagine the effect on a complex application, or on acustomer.andM;Programs aren't written in Magic -- instead, you describe which of thebuilt-in functions you require.andP;  It sounds simple and, once I'd got the hangof it, it was.andP;  Basically, you just give the program a name, some informationabout what the main file is, the keys to be used, and a definition of what ithas to do -- called an 'Execution Definition'.andP;  Once against you have to'fill in the rows' of a table exercise using the F5 (zoom) key to select thefunctions to be applied to fields.andM;Here's a word of warning: don't expect that with all this power you canproduce pretty screens and drop-down menus -- you can't.andP;  The reason issimple.andP;  Unlike dBase, Magic doesn't have a language with room for yourimagination to run riot -- instead it's a tool to let developers concentrateon functionality.andM;In Magic there are some developer's tools hidden away that I've never seenbefore in a piece of PC software.andP;  There are a full set of reports that listall the information available about fields, files and programs, including thelayouts of screens and reports.andM;More important is an extremely powerful Cross Reference utility.andP;  By simplyusing the Alt-X key combination, you can get all the information about wherean entity is used.andP;  This provides a series of displays including tables thatdetail (for the entity or class of entities selected) all its appearanceswithin the Type Dictionary, File Table and Program Dictionary.andP;  This toollets you check where changes will impact, before you make the change ratherthan finding out later that a modification has fouled up a program or datascreen.andM;Many developers are concerned about the level of performance you can get frominterpreted languages and 4GL tools.andP;  However, in our tests, Magicdemonstrated ample speed when lined up against DataEase v4 and FoxBase.andM;A significant element of this performance is that Magic uses Novell's BtrieveRecord Manager, so it will come as no surprise that this product isnetwork-ready and performs best in that environment.andP;  For example, oneapplication with over three million records and a Compaq 386/33 fileserverdriving more than 70 workstations, and running at 75 per cent utilisationshows no performance problems.andM;The Btrieve utilities cover the usual functions like Dump, Load and Recover,but use the crucial Extend function.andP;  This allows you to split large datafiles across logical disk boundaries and means that very large applicationson networks can be managed without too much pain.andP;  So, if your originalsizing was too small and you bought hardware accordingly, then simply buyinganother large disk for your server will get you out of trouble.andM;Because Magic isn't a system that provides stand-alone code, the only way todistribute applications is with a run-time package.andP;  With Magic costing 995pounds and run-times costing 195 pounds, it looks an expensive way ofgenerating applications, but with the cuts in development made by usingMagic, it's a reasonable trade-off.andP;  Large customers should get a discount onthat price, and perhaps they can encourage the suppliers to dump the stupiddongle.andM;Magic isn't really the sort of tool I'd choose for quick and dirtyprogramming, but with practice it's a super tool for prototyping.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
