The trial was the second involving espionage to open in WestGermany in two days. At a trial Monday in Duesseldorf, a woman saidshe gave sensitive data to a Soviet spy because she loved him.   At Tuesday's trial, Helmut Stefan Kolasch, who worked for anelectronics firm that did military work, is charged with providingsensitive computer information on NATO jet fighters to East Germanyand the Soviet KGB intelligence service from 1973 through 1984.   ``I didn't want to have anything to do with those people, Isomehow got pulled into it and then feared they would pressure meif I did not cooperate,'' Kolasch told the court.   ``Now I have to accept the fact that I supported the KGB. Thatis an enormous burden for me to bear,'' Kolasch told the court.   Kolasch was arrested in March 1988, the same month as formerhigh-ranking government secretary Elke Falk, whose trial openedMonday. Ms. Falk has acknowledged providing state secrets to theKGB from 1975 to 1985.   Prosecutors say Kolasch photographed documents pertaining tojets of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and sold thepapers to communist agents while he worked at the West Germanelectronics firm Siemens.   Among the information handed over by Kolasch were details on asensitive aircraft electronics system he himself had developed atSiemens, prosecutors say.   According to court documents, Kolasch handed over the materialto contacts in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Karlsruhe andcollected more than $16,200.   Kolasch said Tuesday he had provided material to an East Germanagent using the alias Heinz Groth, whose whereabouts are unknown.   The prosecution says Groth put Kolasch in contact with a KGBintelligence agent, whom the court said then worked as a secretaryin the Soviet Consulate in Bonn.   Kolasch told the court he was a student in 1968 when he firstmet Groth.   According to Kolasch, Groth gave him a part-time job with abuilding-cleaning company he operated at the time. He said afriendship developed.   Kolasch said he began providing photographed computerinformation to Groth in 1973 ``because I felt obligated to him.''   ``At that time, I didn't have much money,'' Kolasch said.   The trial was adjourned until Thursday. If found guilty, bothKolasch and Ms. Falk could face a maximum sentence of 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
