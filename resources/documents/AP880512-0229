Secretary of State George P. Shultz, winding up two days oftalks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, toldreporters: ``We have reached a completely satisfactory agreement onall of these issues.''   The Senate postponed debate on the treaty Monday while somemembers accused Moscow of backsliding and leaving loopholes forcheating. But Shultz said the differences over verifying compliancewith the pact were a result of implementing an unprecedented systemof on-site inspection.   ``Occasionally, they'll have an argument,'' Shultz said of thetechnicians who will carry out the agreement to destroy 683 Sovietmissiles and 364 U.S. missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles.``That's life.''   He called the settlement he reached with Shevardnadze``absolutely satisfactory.'' It was initialed by Maynard Glitman,who negotiated the treaty, and Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, thesenior arms control adviser to the Soviet military.   Shultz said Glitman and Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the U.S. nationalsecurity adviser, would fly to Washington on Thursday night toreport to the Senate on Friday.   ``I think it will be well-received,'' Shultz said.   The Moscow meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S.Gorbachev is scheduled to begin May 29.   Chief U.S. negotiator Max Kampelman and Soviet negotiator ViktorP. Karpov signed another document at the Soviet mission thatguarantees any futuristic weapons developed in theintermediate-range also would be banned under the treaty.   Two of the principal stumbling blocks to verification of thetreaty dealt with U.S. demands to inspect Soviet missile containersbig enough to hold only a stage of a rocket and the issue of howmuch access U.S. inspectors will have to Soviet missile plants andbases.   Other issues dealt with photographing equipment, updating dataexchanged between the two sides and the size and weight of vehiclesthat can be inspected leaving Votkinsk, where Soviet SS-20 missilesare assembled.   The pact on intermediate-range missiles is unprecedented in itsprovisions for on-site inspection to guard against infractions. Italso is the first U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an entirecategory of nuclear weapons.   The document on futuristic weapons was aimed at convincing Sen.Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, and other critics that the ban would apply tointermediate-range weapons that have not been developed yet.   Glitman and Powell were taking the second document to the Senateas well. While Shultz obviously was satisified with the results, hesaid ``what the Senate does is up to the Senate.''   With evident relief, however, he told reporters: ``I hope I'veheard the last of INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) at theseministerials.''   Shevardnadze, at a separate news conference, said the Sovietsdid not view the differences as technical but as ``very seriousproblems that required political decisions.'' He added: ``And suchsolutions were found.''   Shultz and Shevardnadze declined to provide specific details ofhow the dispute was resolved.   Senior U.S. officials, however, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the Soviets wanted the United States to destroyWest German Pershing 1-A missiles, but were satisfied the Bonngovernment itself would scrap them.   After a telephone call to Bonn, the U.S. side told the Sovietswhere the missiles are stored and how many there are _ 21.   ``We got back to everything we wanted,'' an official said,referring to the range of disputes on INF.   Another official, while not criticizing the Senate, said all theissues could have been resolved quietly with the Soviets if theyhad not been made public in newspaper accounts.   Regarding missile canisters, the official said Americaninspectors will be able to look inside, but not take the parts out.``They gave in enough,'' he said.   Shultz said, ``I think when the senators see it (the agreement)I think they will see that it was worked out satisfactorily.''   On a related subject, Shultz ruled out quick completion ofanother treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear weaponsarsenals by 30 to 50 percent.   Reagan had hoped to make the accord the centerpiece of his fourdays of talks with Gorbachev.   Negotiations are moving slowly on how to verify the scrapping ofmobile missiles as well as cruise missiles carried on warships andfighter planes.   There is also a nagging dispute over the U.S. program to developa space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. TheSoviets are trying to constrict the program, known as Star Wars.   ``It's now clear,'' Shultz said, ``there is no way thesequestions can be shaped up and ready in time for the summit.''</TEXT></DOC>
