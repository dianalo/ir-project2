The Republican race emerges as a Bush-Dole struggle, with the winner of the Iowa caucuses rated the front-runner. A loss by Dole might be fatal; the Senate's late-January return will create tough scheduling problems for him. Bush could be hurt by yesterday's Iran-Contra disclosure. Both Kemp and du Pont need to finish a solid second in New Hampshire to remain credible.    Meanwhile, resentful Democratic candidates scramble to recover after an unsettling week. Dukakis shifts schedules and resources to shore up his base in New Hampshire. Gephardt blasts Hart as an ineffective lawmaker: &quot;I wonder why Gary has never accomplished many of the things he always talks about.&quot; No one is yet directly raising the character issue, but someone may if Hart does well.    The disarray caused by Hart's re-entry makes it easier for Cuomo and Bradley to contemplate candidacies, but little movement is seen until next year, when it might be too late.    MALADROIT MOVES by Nicaragua's Ortega brothers bolster Contra-aid forces.    Nicaraguan defector Roger Miranda says that Defense Minister Humberto Ortega made plans to sign a military-aid pact in Moscow early next year -- just as Congress may be considering Reagan's request for more Contra military aid. President Daniel Ortega's insistence on limiting the agenda for talks with the rebels forecloses major progress, further bolstering Reagan's case.    Foes of Contra aid worry at the revelation -- first confirmed by the Ortegas, then denied, and finally confirmed again -- about a big Nicaraguan military buildup. &quot;You're afraid to give nothing when you see what might be coming down the road,&quot; says a congressional aide who opposes funding.    SLOW GOING: Planning drags for Reagan's fiscal '89 budget.    In a first step, the administration plans to announce next week its new economic growth estimates for next year, which will underlie the budget. The pre-crash 3.5% forecast will be scaled down to the 2.5% to 3% range, but Reagan adviser Sprinkel warns of much slower growth if the Fed doesn't ease its current grip on credit.    Administration officials say Reagan's proposals, currently due Jan. 4 under the Gramm-Rudman law, may miss the deadline by six weeks. Turmoil grows as agencies wrestle with spending targets -- especially in the Pentagon, where military planners battle one another over the reductions suggested by Carlucci to deal with the cuts required by the budget summit.    Even contractors are nervous: Westinghouse recently won a hard-fought contract for Navy surveillance blimps, only to have Secretary Webb suggest dumping the project.    LABOR REFORM: The Senate will try a revolutionary technique next year: a five-day workweek. In the past, little has been accomplished on Mondays and Fridays as senators head out of town to give speeches or visit the homefolk. Majority Leader Byrd hopes the new regimen will allow members one full week off for every three worked.    ROBERTSON SEEKS to deflect talk about his religious beliefs by spelling out a White House team. He envisions Interior Secretary Hodel for chief of staff, Peter Grace for OMB director, Ross Perot or Roger Smith -- who were bitter foes at GM -- for the Pentagon, and nobody for chief of the Fed, because he wants to dissolve it.    KEMP'S CAMPAIGN takes on an increasingly desperate tone. In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble, he lashes out at criticism from a lightly regarded TV commentator. Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination. But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility.    CONSERVATIVES COMPLAIN bitterly about Judge Kennedy's performance in his two days of Senate testimony. &quot;The liberals won,&quot; says Bruce Fein of the Heritage Foundation, a strong backer of original nominee Bork. &quot;If anything, he sounds more liberal&quot; than retired Justice Powell.    CITIES STRUGGLE with the homelessness crisis while Washington action lags.    With the onset of cold weather -- and an election year -- advocates and policy makers try to lift homelessness higher on the nation's political agenda. A Conference of Mayors survey finds demand for emergency shelter and food has risen 20% in 1987. This winter, New Orleans plans health-care vans, while the District of Columbia uses trailers and a bus for emergency shelter.    Meanwhile, federal measures already on the books draw little concrete action. Congressional financing to combat the problem falls below the levels authorized. A task force signed into law five months ago has met only once, and HUD still hasn't named a permanent chief for it. The National Coalition for the Homeless also scores the Education Department and GSA for foot-dragging.    But the coalition says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has moved quickly to get emergency money to shelter providers.    MINOR MEMOS: Some Capitol Hill wags suggest that Hart's new slogan will be &quot;Win one for the zipper&quot;; wife Lee's would be &quot;Trust, but verify.&quot; . . . Others say Donna Rice plans to release a recording of &quot;My Boyfriend's Back.&quot; . . . A prominent Democrat says that Hart's return &quot;proves that there's life after nightlife.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
