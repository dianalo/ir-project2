Mossberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN FREST </CO><IN> MON BNK FIN FRX </IN><G> FED EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. and Japan, stepping up their campaign to bolster the dollar, have arranged to supply the Federal Reserve with more Japanese yen it can use to buy dollars in currency markets.    The move was made known in a joint statement by President Reagan and Japan's new prime minister, Noboru Takeshita, at the conclusion of talks in the White House. In their statement, the two leaders also said that the Bank of Japan will work to &quot;accommodate&quot; lower short-term interest rates in Japan. That could help support the dollar by widening -- or at least maintaining -- the spread between the two nations' interest rates without a rise in U.S. interest rates, which could cause a recession.    In making the statement at the highest levels, the two countries were attempting to warn currency traders not to bet against the dollar. The statement came just two days before the greenback faces a major test -- tomorrow's scheduled release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for November.    Although the trade figures aren't seasonally adjusted and are widely regarded as unreliable, they have become the most slavishly followed economic indicators in currency and other financial markets. If the deficit is larger than traders expect, the dollar could take a pounding. (The dollar responded favorably yesterday to the arrangement by the U.S. and Japan.    Borrowing language used by the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven major industrial countries last Dec. 22, the two leaders declared that &quot;a further decline of the dollar could be counterproductive.&quot; In their statement, the two leaders also noted that &quot;their authorities are cooperating closely on exchange markets and have developed arrangements to assure the adequacy of resources for their cooperative efforts.&quot;    Since Jan. 4, the seven industrial powers have succeeded, through a massive campaign of dollar-buying by central banks, in driving the dollar substantially above the record lows it hit at year end. That effort, which followed the Group of Seven's Dec. 22 declaration that the dollar had fallen enough, was partly based on a belief that the monthly U.S. trade deficits soon would start showing improvement.    October's deficit, released Dec. 10, had been a stunning $17.6 billion. That figure, a record, had helped send the U.S. currency into its sharp year-end decline.    Despite its rise earlier this month, the dollar has flagged in recent days against the yen, partly because of nervousness about Friday's trade figures and a growing suspicion that the central banks might be unwilling or unable to keep buying up dollars with foreign currencies.    By stressing that a new arrangement has been made to supply the Fed with yen, yesterday's Reagan-Takeshita statement sends a signal to markets that the U.S. and Japan are still prepared to back up the Dec. 22 communique. Just before the statement was issued, the dollar was trading in New York at around 126.60 yen. It rose after the statement became known, and closed at 127.30 yen.    U.S. and Japanese officials said that under the yen arrangement, the Bank of Japan would sell yen to the Fed in exchange for Special Drawing Rights, which are monetary units established by the International Monetary Fund. At the end of November, the U.S. held about $10 billion of SDR's.    Koichi Haraguchi, a spokesman for the Japanese delegation, said the new arrangement has been put in place but hasn't yet been activated. Often, such arrangements by central banks are established in advance for use as they are needed.    U.S. and Japanese officials didn't say how many yen the Fed can buy under the deal. The U.S. could spend all its SDR's. However, the U.S. holdings of SDR's are about $3 billion higher than the amount formally allocated to it by the IMF, so a purchase of that amount of yen would still leave the U.S. with its full allocation of SDR's.    An administration official who discussed the new U.S.-Japan arrangement said that the yen-for-SDR deal is just one of a number of ways the central banks could exchange currencies so that they can intervene in currency markets and conduct other operations. It isn't known if this arrangement has been used before.    Other such arrangements, for instance, are &quot;swap lines,&quot; by which the Fed, the Bank of Japan and other central banks supply each other with quantities of the major currencies for a variety of purposes.    U.S. officials interpreted the Japanese interest rate pledge cautiously. The leaders' statement said, &quot;the Bank of Japan agrees, under the present stable price conditions, to pursue the current policy stance and to make efforts to accommodate declining short-term interest rates.&quot;    One official noted that the statement is hedged by a condition that prices stay stable. This official said it mainly means the Japanese won't move anytime soon to raise rates &quot;and won't get too upset if short-term rates start falling a bit.&quot;    Under pressure from the U.S., the Bank of Japan has kept rates low, but it has indicated it would raise them if necessary to curb inflation. If Japanese rates rise, the Fed would come under pressure to raise U.S. rates in order to keep dollar investments attractive to foreigners. But that could risk causing a recession.    At their meeting yesterday, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Takeshita also discussed the Japanese leader's proposal to facilitate bidding by U.S. construction firms for public works contracts in Japan. Neither government would disclose the exact contents of the proposal, but sources said it involved letting U.S. companies form joint-ventures with Japanese companies and other forms of special treatment for U.S. firms.    Putting the best possible face on the proposal, a senior administration official said it &quot;offers a framework for productive discussions,&quot; but cautioned that it &quot;doesn't by itself resolve all the problems.&quot;    Both leaders spoke after the meeting of their desire to support Philippine President Corazon Aquino and her government. Those remarks signaled U.S. expectations that Japan will take a stronger role in assisting the strategic Pacific ally.    Japan pledged last fall the equivalent of $640 million in commodity and project-based loans for the Philippines. Mr. Takeshita's aides said there could be more if Manila speeds up the preparation of deserving projects.    No mention was made at the White House meeting of the dispute involving the Japanese whaling industry. Sixteen U.S. environmental groups filed a suit in a federal district court here protesting plans by the Japanese whaling fleet to kill 300 whales in Antarctic waters, ostensibly for research purposes. The groups demanded that the U.S. retaliate by limiting how much fish the Japanese could catch in U.S. waters. </TEXT></DOC>
