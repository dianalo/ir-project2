A summary ofATF machine parameters is given by Murakami. The model is adjusted togive agreement between measured diagnostics signals and the correspondingvalues inferred from the model plasma. With this agreement, the mainfeatures of the discharge are reproduced including the radiation-inducedtemperature collapse. 7 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
