All patients were well hydrated. Both ionic and nonionicagents were used. The total dose of contrast material ranged from 30to 530 mL (mean, 237 mL). No consistent effect on renal function wasdemonstrated with increasing contrast material doses. With adequate hydration,and within the dose range studied, larger volumes of contrast materialthan are commonly used appear to be safe in patients with normal renalfunction.</TEXT></DOC>
