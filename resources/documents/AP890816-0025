Only 31.5 percent of all unemployed workers _ 2.1 million out of6.7 million _ received benefits in the average month last year, theliberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said Tuesday.   That percentage tied the record low measured in 1987, and was thesixth straight year that the proportion receiving assistance has notimproved.   Researchers at the Washington-based center conceded that thefigure was not as alarming as it appears on its surface, becauselarge numbers of jobless people do not qualify for publicassistance. Nonetheless, they said the finding is significantbecause it shows that the public safety net is shrinking.   ``The record low level of unemployment insurance coverage in 1988not only indicates an economic security problem for today'sunemployed, but it also may be a harbinger of what will occur in theevent of a new recession,'' the group's report said.   The center calculated the figures using Department of Laborstatistics.   Isaac Shapiro, a researcher at the center who helped write thereport, attributed the high number of jobless people withoutinsurance to a tendency for workers to be out of work longer thanbefore. Public unemployment programs expire after a fixed period,usually 26 weeks for state aid and 13 additional weeks for federalbenefits that last year were available in only one state: Alaska.   Shapiro cited federal and state eligibility restrictions thatwere tightened during the 1980s. He said another factor was theincrease in service jobs at the expense of manufacturing positions,where workers are more likely to be notified by their union orcompany that they can apply for assistance.   ``With a service economy, it's less likely people might knowthey're eligible,'' he said.   Mary Ann Wyrsch, director of unemployment insurance in theDepartment of Labor, did not dispute the report's statistics.   But she said many of the jobless don't qualify for unemploymentinsurance because they did not work long enough, left their jobsvoluntarily or were fired for adverse actions. Historically, onlyabout 40 percent of the jobless receive coverage, she said.   ``We're concerned about the difference between the 40-odd percentand the 31 percent that is reported'' by the center, she said.   Between 1955, the earliest year for which figures are available,and 1984, the percentage of covered workers dropped below 40 percentonly once, when it hit 39.3 percent in 1966.   The nation's unemployment rate has dropped steadily since 1982,when it reached 9.7 percent. It was 5.5 percent last year.   The center said the situation was worst for minorities. Just 21percent of unemployed blacks and 14 percent of jobless Hispanicsreceived unemployment benefits last year, according to the report.   In 28 states and the District of Columbia, two-parent familieswith a jobless worker can get other assistance, even if they do notreceive unemployment insurance.   The proportion of jobless workers receiving benefits last yearvaried widely among the states, from 17.3 percent in Florida to 72percent in Rhode Island.   Only in four states did most unemployed workers get insurance:Rhode Island; Massachusetts where 57.3 percent were covered; Alaskawith 51.5 percent; and Vermont with 50.2 percent.   By contrast, there were 16 states where less than one-in-fourjobless workers was covered: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire,New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and WestVirginia.</TEXT></DOC>
