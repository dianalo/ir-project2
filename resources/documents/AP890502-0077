Three rounds flew over camp known as Site 2, striking a road,and two shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later, said PatrickVan de Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation.No casualties were reported.   Van De Velde said that in the past 10 days, 15 shells or rocketshave landed in or around Site 2. Three seriously wounded refugeeswere sent to the hospital of the International Committee of the RedCross, a Red Cross official said.   ``We are concerned by the repeated instances of shelling ofcivilian encampments and appeal to concerned parties to refrainfrom harming innocent civilians,'' Van de Velde said.   Site 2 houses about 180,000 refugees. It is in Prachinburiprovince, near the border with Cambodia, and about 50 miles northof the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.   The camp is controlled by the Khmer People's National LiberationFront, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the forces of Vietnamand of the government it installed in Cambodia after invading inlate 1978.   It is not clear who is responsible for the recent shellings,which have forced the temporary evacuation of all but the mostessential relief personnel.   ``Whoever is doing the shelling, the aim is clear. They want todisrupt the relief services, they want to disrupt normal life inthe camp,'' said the Red Cross official, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   Some officials theorized the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian forceswere shelling the camp to pressure the refugees to abandon theresistance and return to Cambodia. Others theorized that theguerrillas were doing it to convince the world they needed moreweapons to defend the camp.   In the past, shellings of the border camps also have escalatedas the two sides maneuvered diplomatically. Prince NorodomSihanouk, leader of the resistance coalition, has been holdingtalks in Indonesia this week with Hun Sen, premier of Cambodia.   Vietnam has said it will withdraw its forces by the end ofSeptember. Sihanouk's three-party resistance coalition includes theKhmer Rouge, which was blamed for killing hundreds of thousands ofpeople when it ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam's invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
