He declined to saywhether the CFTC was likely to undertake any enforcementaction.</LP><TEXT>   Daily volume on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange jumpedfrom the usual 8,000 contracts a day to 11,800 on Tuesday,15,400 Wednesday and 14,000 Thursday.   The New York market was abuzz with speculation Friday thatsomeone might have capitalized on Thursday's news throughinsider trading. For example, a Brazilian company with highpolitical connections was rumored to have bought 2,000futures contracts in New York ahead of the announcement, andto have sold the contracts on Friday.   The activity appears to have sparked concern in Brazil.The halt in exports isn't supposed to apply to previouslyarranged sales. But Ricardo Mesquita, director of supply andprices at the Economy Ministry, told coffee growers at ameeting in Sao Paulo late Friday that the government willexamine the volume of coffee registered for export throughMarch 21, and that if there is &quot;any registry of an astoundingvolume {the deal} will not be accepted.&quot;   Confusion about Brazil's export policy sent the marketinto wild gyrations Friday. Coffee for May delivery opened at99.25 cents a pound, up 4.25 cents from Thursday's close, andpeaked at $1 during the session. But prices later plummetedto 93.05 cents a pound, down 1.95 cents on the day.   Profit-taking on large positions established in the daysbefore the announcement was rumored to have contributed tothe sell-off on Friday.   At the Sao Paulo meeting, Mr. Mesquita described theexport suspension as an interim step in a broader effort topush prices higher. He said Brazil's government would set upa commission to consider returning to an international coffeequota agreement.   The talk of reviving quotas &quot;astounded coffee producers,consumers and dealers,&quot; said Nestor Osorio, Colombia'sdelegate at the International Coffee Organization in London.&quot;At an ICO meeting in London only three weeks ago, Brazil wasagainst moves to support international coffee prices.&quot;   Brazil dropped out of the previous quota system in 1989under pressure from other members to cut its quota. Sincethen, other countries have been seeking a return to coffeequotas, but Brazil up to now has been the chief advocate of afree-market system, analysts say. Now, with the possibilityof an agreement, some analysts who formerly expected coffeebeans to reach $1.10 a pound by late summer are looking for aprice between $1.10 and $1.30 a pound.   An official of the ICO in London said the organizationhadn't received a formal notification from Brazil explainingthe export suspension or its plans for international pricestabilization.   Adding to Friday's confusion among coffee traders wereconflicting reports from different parts of Brazil'sgovernment. Brazil's Ministry of Economy made the decision tosuspend exports and consider a quota agreement, but kept theMinistry of Foreign Affairs that negotiates internationalcommodity agreements in the dark, according to coffeeofficials in London.   The confusion may persist this week. A Brazilian newspaperreported on Saturday that the Foreign Ministry denied Brazilwas considering a return to quotas.   Mr. Mesquita said there isn't any deadline for decidingwhether to resume quotas. Coffee producers in Brazil saidthey expect a decision by fall.   The government is &quot;studying the day and manner in which itwill reopen&quot; exports, Mr. Mesquita said, declining to bespecific. Coffee growers said after the meeting with Mr.Mesquita and Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello thatthey expect export sales to resume within two weeks.   Halting export sales &quot;was a mistake,&quot; said Suelly EvandroAmarante, president of Brazil's National Coffee Council, aprivate group representing coffee growers. He and othergrowers criticized the export halt because it pushed worldcoffee prices up, allowing other countries to capitalize onthe Brazilian decision. According to Gazeta Mercantil, aBrazilian business daily, the Brazilian Federation of CoffeeExporters has sent a telex to Ms. Carodosa de Mello, urgingthe Brazilian government to ask the U.S. CFTC to investigatethe possibility of insider trading and requesting theimmediate resumption of export sales. The CFTC said Fridaythat it hadn't received such a request.   The Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange declined to comment onwhether it was examining the unusually heavy trading volumein coffee. Reuter reported that traders are expecting atleast one floor brokerage operation to be reviewed by theexchange's compliance department.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          An indication over the weekend that some non-OPEC oilproducers are willing to join the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries in curbing production should be a bullishfactor in crude oil futures prices this week. In a localnewspaper, Oman's oil minister said his country, whichcurrently has a daily output of about 700,000 barrels, isready to cut output because &quot;the responsibility of achievingstability in the oil market should not be shouldered by OPECalone.&quot; There was no word on whether Oman's cuts would equalthe 5% that OPEC members agreed to. On the bearish side forprices are persistent rumors that a large fleet of shipscarrying crude or refined products is on its way to the U.S.from the Mideast.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meat                                                                                                          Traders this week will be watching for results of theAgriculture Department's hogs and pigs report, which is dueThursday. Most analysts are expecting an increase of 2% to 3%in the USDA's estimate of hogs on farms and a rise of aboutthe same amount in hog farmers' production plans for thefuture. Analysts say these expectations of increasing hogsupplies are likely to exert downward pressure on porkfutures prices throughout the week.   In cattle futures, the market will continue to react todwindling production of beef, analysts said. Last week,several meatpackers, including Excel Corp., announced plansto temporarily close slaughterhouses or lay off workersbecause of weak demand for beef and because of poor profitmargins. The trend may continue this week, and it likely willbe accompanied by a slight surge in demand for beef, someanalysts say. The week after Easter is traditionally a strongconsumer buying period for red meat, and retailers tend tostock up for this demand during the week preceding Easter.The conventional effect of such retailer buying, coupled withdiminishing production, would be upward pressure on cattlefutures prices. But analysts caution that last week themarket acted anything but conventionally: Even in the face ofslaughterhouse closings, prices didn't rise substantially.</TEXT></DOC>
