The bank board, which regulates 3,150 Sandamp;Ls, said it will begin onTuesday to pay off deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 inthe North America Savings and Loan Association and the AmericanDiversified Savings Bank.   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said it was the largest cashpayout ever for the agency.   It is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp. to American Diversified depositers and $209 millionto North America depositers.   After recovering some of its costs by selling the institutions'assets, the bank board expects ultimately to spend $931 million _$798 million for American Diversified and $133 million for NorthAmerica.   Depositers who had funds above the insurance limit will share inthe liquidation proceeds.   Both institutions share the same headquarters and have beeninsolvent for some time.   Prior to the closing in Costa Mesa, the largest payout was $300million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,Texas.   However, bank board officials expect the cost of several previousbailout packages eventually to be higher than the cost of closingthe two thrifts in Costa Mesa.   Last month, the bank board said it was paying $2 billion inassistance _ in the form of notes and guarantees, none of it in cash_ to the Southwest Savings Association in Dallas to take over fourailing institutions. In November, it announced a $1.3 billionbailout of Vernon Savings and Loan in Dallas, $200 million of it incash. The rest of the assistance came in the form of notes.   Wall said the bank board prefers to pay a healthier institutionto take over insolvent thrifts because it is cheaper for theinsurance fund. But in this case, he said the two Sandamp;Ls had littlevalue as going concerns because they lacked retail deposits andbranch offices. Instead, they relied on high-cost, short-termdeposits arranged through brokers.   Wall hailed today's closings as the opening of a second front inthe board's drive to remove institutions that have been driving upthe cost of funds for all institutions. The first front is Texas,Louisiana and Oklahoma, which have the largest concentration ofailing thrifts.   In order to attract money, North America had to offer an averagedeposit rate of 8.53 percent, 1.45 percentage points above theaverage for all thrift institutions. American Diversified was paying8.64 percent, 1.56 percentage points higher than the average.   ``So today we march forward in our drive to remove from themarketplace those high-rate-paying insolvent thrifts,'' Wall said ina statement.   The bank board attributed the failure of North America, which waschartered in 1983, to ``unsafe and unsound'' business practices. Itsaid the association grew rapidly by aggressively solicitinghigh-cost jumbo certificates of deposit that were then invested inhigh-risk real estate loan participations and time-sharinginvestments.   It had been in the bank board's management consignment programsince January 1987. A month after that, the insurance fund suedJanet McKenzie, executive assistant to the chairman, for $40 million.   As of March 31, North America had $98.2 miilion in assets and$215.7 million in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $1.59million a month.   American Diversified, orginally chartered in 1980 as TokaySavings and Loan Association, had been in the management consignmentprogram since February 1986.   FSLIC has filed suit against Ranhir Sahni, who in 1983 led theassociation into what it called an ``explosive growth policy.'' Itis seeking $60 million, charging fraud, negligence and racketeering.   As of March 31, American Diversified had $509 million in assetsand $1.12 billion in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $8.3million a month.   Depositers may present their claims either in person through June24 or by mail. The bank board said depositors will receive thenecessary forms in the mail. Questions can be directed to FSLIC at1-800-347-6660.   More than 500 of the nation's federally insured savingsinstitutions are insolvent. The bank board says it is too soon totell if it has enough money to resolve the cases of all 500, but itsays it has enough to resolve the 200 worst cases.   Last year Congress authorized the board to raise up to $10.8billion by selling bonds over the next three years, providing theagency with total revenue of about $20 billion.   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigatingarm, estimates the cost of the cleanup at $26 billion to $36billion. Some private analysts estimate the price tag at more than$50 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
