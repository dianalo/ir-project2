On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil, preciousmetals, grains, soybeans, livestock and stocks all declined.   Cotton for October delivery had gained 2.6 cents a pound duringthe previous two days on speculation that Hurricane Gilbert wouldstrike the Louisiana or northern Texas coastline and damage cottoncrops in the Mississippi Delta region.   But the huge storm appeared to be tracking further south onThursday and was expected to do little harm to the cotton crop,analysts said. Sell orders poured into the Cotton Exchange, sendingsome contracts down the limit in the morning. Prices recovered atmidday but closed limit-down in a second round of heavy selling.   ``There was a lot of selling coming in, partially profit-taking,partially establishing new positions, which says there is no needfor cotton to be at these levels,'' said Ernest Simon, cottonspecialist in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Furious winds and driving rain still were forecast for thesouthern Texas coastline but most of the cotton in that areaalready has been harvested, analysts said.   The hurricane poses the worst threat to cotton plants with openbolls that expose the white fibers to the elements.   ``Any rain will stress the cotton, discolor it and dirt will getinside,'' said Judith Ganes, an analyst in New York with ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. ``Not only can the crop lose quantity, but thequality is diminished.''   Simon said the only exposed cotton was in western Texas. Most ofthe cotton in the state's north-central and west-central regionshad not opened yet, and growers there want rain, he said.   Cotton settled 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in October at 54.85 cents a pound.   The prospects of a major disruption of oil refining along theTexas-Louisiana coast also diminished with the changing hurricaneforecasts, sending energy futures prices down sharply on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 46 cents to 50 centslower with October at $14.90 a barrel; heating oil was 1.16 centsto 1.37 cents lower with October at 42.70 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .48 cent to 1.39 cents lower with October at 45.63cents a gallon.   The drop in energy prices reinforced the prevailing bearishattitude among gold futures traders on New York's CommodityExchange, where prices dropped to their lowest levels in more than17 months.   Credit-tightening moves by the Federal Reserve and central banksin Europe have weakened inflationary pressures and dampenedinvestor demand for gold, said George Anagnos, metals analyst withThomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.   The Commerce Department's report that retail sales declined 0.2percent last month ``simply confirmed the precedent of recenteconomic statistics, which suggest the economy is growing in a moretempered and sustainable fashion,'' he said.   Gold settled $2.70 to $3.50 lower with the contract for deliveryin October at $419.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to 3 centslower with September at $6.467 a troy ounce.   Grain and soybean futures finished broadly lower on the ChicagoBoard of Trade after an attempt to rally soybean prices to lastweek's highs fizzled, prompting a rapid last-minute sell-off.   Fading fears of crop damage from Hurricane Gilbert also fueledthe decline, analysts said.   Wheat settled 5{ cents to 6} cents lower with September at $4.07a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with September at$2.82\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower withSeptember at $2.65 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 10 centslower with September at $8.72{ a bushel.   Cattle futures settled mostly lower in line with lower cashprices. Trading was cautious ahead of Friday's seven-statecattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture Department.   Hog futures also were pressured by lower cash markets but frozenpork bellies finished higher in a technically inspired rally,analysts said.   Live cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent lower with October at70.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to .12 centhigher with September at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .60 centlower to .20 cent higher with October at 37.95 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .50 cent higher with Februaryat 48.72 cents a pound.   Stock-index futures retreated modestly on the Chicago MercantileExchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standardandamp; Poor's 500 index settled 1.65 points lower at 267.80.</TEXT></DOC>
