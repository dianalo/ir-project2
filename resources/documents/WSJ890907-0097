Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. all have or will have separate luxury car divisions here by year-end. Mazda executives have said in the past they were considering such a move, but yesterday's announcement was the first indication of any official action.    Richard Colliver, 50 years old, formerly senior vice president of Mazda's western area operations, was named to head the task force, which will report to Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America, Inc. A Mazda spokesman said there isn't any timetable for a decision on the network.    The U.S. subsidiary also announced an internal reorganization &quot;to improve its responsiveness to Mazda dealers and customers.&quot; As part of the reorganization, George McCabe, 48, has been promoted to group vice president of operations. He will head a newly formed operations group with responsibility for Mazda's five U.S. regional offices, sales operations, dealer development and advertising. Mr. McCabe was most recently deputy general manager and group vice president for sales and marketing. </TEXT></DOC>
