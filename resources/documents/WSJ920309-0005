The retailer, based in York, Pa., has stuck to the placesit knows well -- smaller cities and towns in Pennsylvania andneighboring states -- and targeted the moderate-incomeconsumer who wants style but good value, too. While manylarge retailers around the country are experiencing flat ordown business, it has done fairly well, said Michael L.Gleim, senior vice president and chief administrativeofficer.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gleim, in an interview, said Bon Ton expects to reportfiscal fourth-quarter and full-year earnings of 68 to 70cents a share and 89 to 93 cents a share, respectively. &quot;I'mconfident we'll be on the high side of those ranges,&quot; addedMr. Gleim. That's in line with the estimate of the twoanalysts who are following the company.   Bon Ton operates several dozen stores, mainly inPennsylvania but also in Maryland, West Virginia and NewYork.   The results for the year ended Jan. 31 compare with proforma earnings of 75 cents a share for the year-beforequarter and 67 cents a share for fiscal 1991. Recentper-share earnings were affected by an increase in the numberof shares outstanding because of last year's initial publicoffering. Most retailers, with fiscal years ending in Januaryor early February, make the bulk of their profits in thefourth quarter with the Christmas shopping season. Also, Mr.Gleim said, companies often use the slower quarters to spendon capital programs, further accentuating the profit swingfrom the fourth quarter.   The company previously reported sales for the quarter andyear rose 4.9% and 8.4%, respectively, to $103.8 million and$298 million. Comparable-store sales were up 2.9% for thequarter and 6.4% for the year. &quot;We're pretty happy aboutthat. Most retailers have had a flat to down business,&quot; Mr.Gleim noted. He said annual sales per square foot, excludingthose of leased departments, are currently $149 to $150, andhe hopes to see that sales measurement grow about 5% a year.Average store size for Bon Ton is about 80,000 square feet,he said.   Bon Ton Stores made an initial public offering lastSeptember of 3.5 million shares at $13 each. The publiclytraded shares represent about 33% of total sharesoutstanding, but only about 6% of voting power. Sharesoutstanding include about 6.4 million Class A shares withsupervoting rights, held almost entirely by members of thefounding Grumbacher family. M. Thomas Grumbacher is thecurrent chairman.   Mr. Gleim said &quot;we intend to continue our secondary marketstrategy,&quot; which includes opening new stores and makingsensible acquisitions. He cited the recent agreement toacquire Watt andamp; Shand Inc., which operates two departmentstores in Lancaster, Pa. &quot;That was extremely good for us,&quot; hesaid, because Lancaster has only one shopping mall and BonTon can hold a dominant retail position there.   Bon Ton's strategy is to stick to secondary markets withless retail competition than big urban areas. &quot;We want todominate in the things we sell. If a competitor has more inhome products, we will scale back in that area to concentrateon apparel, where we can be a leader,&quot; the official said.   He said growth is strong in Maryland towns, where it hassome stores, as people move away from the immediate areaaround Washington, D.C. Further, he said, the company hasidentified &quot;about 25 contiguous areas&quot; to its current marketsthat are candidates for expansion.   The company also has worked hard in figuring out thedemographics of the areas it serves. &quot;Many of our marketsdon't have strong population growth, but on the other hand,there's not a lot of retail competition there,&quot; Mr. Gleimsaid. &quot;In these communities, people can actually have ahigher percentage of disposable income, despite the overalleconomic trend.&quot; He said that's &quot;mainly because housing is somuch cheaper,&quot; but also because other costs of living arelower.   &quot;Our core customer is a moderate-income man or woman, age25 to 55, with income from the low $30,000 range tomid-$50,000,&quot; Mr. Gleim said. Naturally, there are othercustomers, Mr. Gleim said, &quot;but there are enough of the coretype for us to do well.&quot;   People are also financially conservative in Bon Ton'smarkets, Mr. Gleim said. &quot;They tend to pay their billsquickly, and our bad-debt picture is much better than formajor market retailers.&quot; Bon Ton's delinquent accounts areless than 1% of credit sales, compared with 2% to 3% for bigretailers, he said. People in these markets want somefashion, but they also want reasonable prices, Mr. Gleimsaid. Some of its leading brand lines are Liz Claiborne, LeviStrauss, Estee Lauder and Esprit. While the company has donerelatively well, like other retailers its profit has beenunder pressure from promotions such as sales or markdowns.   Bon Ton's merchandise line is mainly apparel, whichaccounts for about 72% of sales, Mr. Gleim said. Cosmeticsaccount for 8%, accessories 9% and home products, includingbed and bath items, 10%. A few stores also sell furniture.   Liz Claiborne Inc. is Bon Ton's single biggest vendor,accounting for about 7% of sales volume, Mr. Gleim said. &quot;Ourstrategy is to be a fashion leader at all price ranges.Fashion doesn't have to be determined solely by price,&quot; headded.   The company's debt equals about 40% of total capital, Mr.Gleim said. After the public offering, Bon Ton had roughly$25 million in cash available, and after completion of thepurchase of Watt andamp; Shand, it should still have cash on handof $12 million to $15 million, Mr. Gleim said.</TEXT></DOC>
