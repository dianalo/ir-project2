A statement released by the president's office Sunday night saidthe government would maintain its 6-month-old freeze on the pesocurrency exchange rate and prices for government-regulated goodsand services through the end of the administration.   The government said it would not increase the federal minimumwage, also frozen since Feb. 29. But it said the national sales taxfor processed foods and medicines, as well as taxes on rents, wouldbe lowered in some cases to bolster workers' real income.   Implemented in December, the first phase of the so-calledEconomic Solidarity Pact between the government, labor and businesssectors expires Aug. 31. The new measures announced Sunday go intoeffect Sept. 1.   ``What we have achieved with the Economic Solidarity Pact is notartificial, nor is it casual, nor has it responded to immediatepolitical objectives,'' de la Madrid said at a ceremony attended bymembers of his cabinet and the heads of leading business and labororganizations at the presidential residence.   The program was unveiled as Mexico's inflation rate was soaringto a record 159.2 percent in 1987. On Aug. 10, the central Bank ofMexico announced the Pact had succeeded in bringing consumer pricesdown to a 1.7 percent increase in July, the lowest monthly rise inseven years.   Inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 43.3percent, while the annual rate between July 1987 and July was 122.3percent, the central bank said.   The measures announced on Sunday include:   _Prices for gasoline, telephone service, natural gas,electricity and other goods and services sold by the governmentwill remain stable;   _The peso exchange rate with the U.S. dollar will remain frozen;   _The government will reduce its Value Added Tax from six to zeropercent on processed foods and medicines, with retailers requiredto pass the savings on to consumers;   _The daily minimum wage, currently about $3.50 in the FederalDistrict of Mexico City, will remain frozen;   _Taxes on rents will be reduced for those workers earning lessthan four times the daily minimum wage;   _By Sept. 1, retailers will be obliged to lower prices for theirgoods an average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect betweenJuly 7 and August 7.   De la Madrid said the government would continue its attempts toalleviate shortages in certain goods, such as meats, that haveappeared since the officially voluntary pact went into effect.   But he warned the government ``will not abandon the use ofinstruments and responsibilities of authority in necessary cases''to enforce compliance with price guidelines, the statement said.   ``The final objective of the fight against inflation is to reachrates of price increases similar to those of our principal tradepartners,'' de la Madrid said.   The timing of the announcement was important for the president,economists here agreed. The government wanted to stop costlyspeculation that it planned to devalue the peso against the dollar.On the controlled market last week, the peso traded at 2,241 to buyand 2,273 to sell.   The announcement also provides two weeks' lead time for reactionto subside before de la Madrid gives his final state of the nationspeech on Sept. 1.   The president is virtually certain to be replaced by CarlosSalinas de Gortari, his former planning and budget minister, onDec. 1.   The 3-month extension of the minimum wage freeze and lowering ofretail prices represented a compromise by both government and labor.   Only Saturday, Jorge Sanchez, president of the umbrella LaborCongress, said his organization would not abide by a renewal of thepact unless the government either raised salaries to compensate forinflation since February or forced the private sector to reduce itsretail prices.   Sunday's presidential statement quoted Sanchez as saying thepact's second phase provided ``a greater protection for the realsalary of the workers.''</TEXT></DOC>
