This staged miscibleflood is forecasted to recover an incremental 6% of the original oil-in-place.To ensure maximum tertiary oil recovery, Esso Resources has initiateda thorough reservoir surveillance program. The program includes a computersystem to monitor production, injection, and voidage data, a radioactivetracer program to track solvent and water flow, injection and productionlogs to monitor the zonal distribution of the injected solvent, reservoirpressure surveys to ensure solvent/oil miscibility and solvent containment,solvent injection composition monitoring, and a sampling program to monitorreproduced fluid compositions. This paper discusses each of these reservoirsurveillence tools and how the results are being used to optimize thehydrocarbon miscible flood in the Judy Creek Beaverhill Lake &quot;A&quot; Pool.3 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
