<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0051 </DOCNO><TEXT>Atmospheric pressure ionization (API) mass spectrometry has sufficientsensitivity to allow determination of trace levels of analytes directlyin the gas phase without a concentration step; thus, it can, in principle,be used to identify and quantify trace, organic constituents in air withoutresorting to time consuming and potentially sample-altering pretreatment.These attributes make API mass spectrometry a prime candidate for studyingthe complex mixtures of products generated by photooxidation reactionsin real or simulated atmospheres. Mass peaks arising from two sourcesthat interfere with the determination of analytes by API mass spectrometrywill be discussed. These are: (1) series of cluster ions resulting fromthe ionization process, and (2) fragment ions formed from unimoleculardecomposition of parent ions. The experiments were conducted using asingle preparation of an artificial test atmosphere initially consistingof 36 ppm methanol, 190 ppm toluene, and 1.4 ppm benzaldehyde at a nominalrelative humidity of 50%. The 12 L sample reservoir and the flow systemused in this study are shown in Figure 2. The relative humidity of thegas stream entering the API source was adjusted by diluting, up to 8fold, the gas stream exiting the reservoir with dry zero air. The APIsource pressure was controlled by regulating the gas flow into the APIsource with a flow controller.</TEXT></DOC>
