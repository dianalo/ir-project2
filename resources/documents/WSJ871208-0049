The mood among the early arrivals for the organization's December conference, which begins tomorrow, was as gloomy as the overcast skies here. With the cartel's own economic experts generally forecasting a drop in demand for OPEC oil, finding a way to maintain the current bench mark price is the top item on the most challenging agenda facing the ministers in at least a year.    &quot;How the hell can we defend $18 (a barrel)?&quot; Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, said.    With oil inventories brimming and with a possible world-wide economic slowdown threatening to cut into demand, OPEC continues to pour out petroleum at as much as two million barrels a day above its year-old production ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day. Some analysts forecast that spot-market oil prices could plunge to $15 a barrel -- and possibly lower -- early next year.    &quot;The panorama is very bleak,&quot; a senior OPEC official said.    Preventing another price collapse, such as the devastating plunge to below $10 a barrel in 1986, depends largely on enticing Iraq back into the production-quota system, which it has flouted this year, several oil ministers contend. Whether Iraq comes back into the fold depends mainly on whether it receives a production quota as large as that of its war foe, Iran, whose limit is currently 2.4 million barrels a day -- and, perhaps, more important, on what the Iranians demand in return.    Ironically, to accomplish this, several of OPEC's 13 member states are proposing an increase in the production ceiling to allow a higher quota for Iraq. The Kuwaiti oil minister, for example, answers his own question about defending the bench mark price, by recommending an increase in OPEC's ceiling next year to between 18 million and 19 million barrels a day. He called 18.4 million a &quot;reasonable forecast&quot; for the average ceiling over the year.    &quot;The problem is not the ceiling, it's being persistent in following whatever quotas&quot; are assigned, Sheik Ali said.    Since OPEC decided last year to return to a quota system, Iraq has demanded production parity with Iran. But despite having a considerably smaller quota of only 1.5 million barrels a day, Iraq is producing pell-mell -- as much as 2.7 million barrels a day. By increasing the ceiling of the entire organization and enlarging Iraq's quota, several OPEC nations assume that Iraqi output would actually decline, thereby bringing down the group's overall production.&quot;    &quot;I think it is a vital necessity to bring Iraq into the agreement,&quot; said Subroto, the oil minister of Indonesia. &quot;But how that is done is the question we want to address.&quot; Iran's delegation, which is scheduled to arrive this morning, is still to be heard from officially.    But Iran's conditions are known to be at least twofold. For one, it maintains that if Iraq receives a higher quota, then the increase must be offset by production cuts among OPEC's Arab members in the Persian Gulf, which support Iraq in the war.    In addition, Iran has made no secret of wishing a price increase to account for inflation and the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar -- which together have cost OPEC upwards of $3 a barrel since the $18-a-barrel bench mark was fixed a year ago, according to the organization's economic specialists. Iranian oil officials have said they will seek a price increase of at least $2 a barrel. Libya, for one, supports that goal. &quot;We hope that we will reach better than&quot; $18 a barrel, said Fawzi Shakshuki, the Libyan oil minister, adding that a bench mark of $20 a barrel would be &quot;all right.&quot;    But a senior OPEC official called a possible price increase &quot;a non-issue.&quot; OPEC behavior is starkly different from that of earlier this year, when disciplined production and a refusal to stray from official prices kept spot-market prices firm and helped to drain huge world-wide inventories. But escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf last summer touched off waves of new panic buying by refiners, caused OPEC production to surge far beyond the ceiling and left 200 million barrels of excess crude oil above ground.    &quot;The industry world-wide is holding about four days of excess supplies,&quot; said Ed Krapels, president of Washington, D.C.-based Energy Security Analysis, which tracks world inventories. &quot;A year ago it was two days.&quot;    As a result, a majority of OPEC's own economic specialists forecast that demand for OPEC oil next year will average only 17.5 million barrels a day -- and much less than that in the first quarter. But, however the ministers adjust the production ceiling, maintaining price stability depends more heavily on whether evidence is visible that the ceiling is being respected.    &quot;If OPEC is perceived to be cheating on its own agreements, OPEC loses credibility -- and we have a free-for-all,&quot; the senior cartel official said.    ---                     Quota vs. Production          Daily production, in thousands of barrels                                CURRENT       NOVEMBER*                                QUOTAS         AVERAGE    Saudia Arabia                4,343          3,890    Iran                         2,369          2,080    Iraq                         1,540          2,605    Kuwait                         996          1,100    U.A.E.                         948          1,825    Qatar                          299            335    Venezuela                    1,571          1,600    Nigeria                      1,301          1,200    Libya                          996          1,045    Indonesia                    1,190          1,200    Algeria                        667            670    Gabon                          159            175    Ecuador                        221            320    Neutral zone**                 ---            420    TOTAL                       16,600         18,465   * Estimated by Petro-logistics, Geneva   ** Shared equally by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait but notincluded in production quotas</TEXT></DOC>
