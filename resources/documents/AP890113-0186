DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A day after announcing a $735 million tax package,Gov. Michael S. Dukakis launched a campaign Friday to buildpolitical support for the plan, which has drawn little enthusiasm inthe Legislature.   The governor's first stop on what aides said would be anaggressive, highly visible statewide lobbying effort was Bunker HillCommunity College, the kind of government investment Dukakis sayshis tax plan is designed to protect.   ``For our children and our grandchildren's sakes _ 180,000 of whoattend our public colleges and universities _ we must go forward,''Dukakis said, calling education the key to good jobs. ``That's why Ineed your support for the revenue package I unveiled last night.''   His plan, which seeks to raise $131 million in the next sixmonths and $604 million in the following year, targets drinkers,smokers, drivers, investors, corporations and utilities.   The governor said he was committed to building support for newtaxes rather than pare government spending much further.   Dukakis told the House and Senate Ways and Means committeesFriday that he is withholding $250 million in spending authorized inthe $11.6 billion budget because the state does not have the moneyto pay for the spending.   Dukakis told legislators that his Revenue Advisory Board metThursday and made no change in its forecast of state taxcollections. At its last meeting in December, the board trimmed $308million from its projection for the current fiscal year, which endson June 30.   In addition to meeting with hundreds of students and universityofficials at the Bunker Hill campus, the governor also spent much ofthe day giving interviews to Massachusetts television stations topromote the program.   The biggest element in the package was a proposed doubling in thepersonal income tax rate on profits from capital gains oninvestments. Dukakis proposed keeping the current exemption forsales of homes and would exempt profits from new investments inMassachusetts.   Dukakis also proposed raising the gasoline tax from 11 cents to17 cents a gallon; adding 4 cents per pack to the cigarette excise;a 50 percent increase in the state tax on beer, wine and alcohol;and applying the sales tax to purchases by utilities and tointerstate telephone calls and data transmissions.   In addition, Dukakis called for diverting $14 million from theUnemployment Insurance Trust Fund to a job training program andchanging the schedule of filing corporate estimated taxes to bringin an extra $46 million this year.   Dukakis will present the tax proposal in a legislative package toskeptical legislators next week, just past the mid-point in thebudget year. He said the plan would have to take effect by April 1to help balance the budget this year.   In December, Dukakis acknowledged a shortfall of at least $600million in the current state budget of $11.6 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
