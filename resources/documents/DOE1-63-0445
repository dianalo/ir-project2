In particular, the paper will reveal that the social informationprovided in such E.I.S.'s can achieve much more than simply satisfyinggovernment requirements. Such information can form the basis of a strategyto deal with the settlement of a mine workforce in either an existingor newly developed community. A strategy of this type can go a long waytowards avoiding many of the social problems and related industrial disputesoften created in such circumstances. It will also be of significant benefitto the mining company in negotiating its infrastructure package withthe local authority. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
