(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Horn has played on records by GeorgeHarrison, Frank Sinatra and the Beach Boys. He's played in movieswith Elvis Presley and Spencer Tracy.   And he's played the theme songs for such TV shows as ``The OddCouple'' and ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father.''   Harrison, the ex-Beatle, recruited him for the historic 1971concert and movie, ``Concert for Bangla Desh.'' He was part of thefamous ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' concert tour in 1970 thatpropelled Joe Cocker to star status.   The public may not have heard of Jim Horn, but in recordingcircles in the United States and Europe he's a versatileinstrumentalist.   ``I've been around awhile and I've been able to do somethings,'' he says modestly about his 25-year music career and aresume bulging with achievements.   His specialty is the saxophone, but he also plays the flute,piccolo and recorder. Over the years, he's played a multitude ofother instruments while being associated with many of the top namesin show business.   He can be heard playing his horn on Harrison's latest hit LP,``Cloud Nine.''   ``His (Harrison's) singing sounded better than ever,'' Horn saidin an interview before a recording session with country star HankWilliams Jr. ``And when he plays, you know it's him _ that slideguitar.''   Horn worked with another former Beatle, Paul McCartney, a yearago when McCartney helped produce an album by guitar legend DuaneEddy.   ``He (McCartney) worked with the musicians well,'' he recalled.``Everyone knew what to do. He was real jovial and funny, crackingjokes. He was fun to work with.''   Presley, too, was a free spirit when Horn played in the movies``Girls, Girls, Girls'' and ``Roustabout.''   ``He liked to sit around and play,'' Horn said. ``He'd `jam.' Hewas into karate and he'd break wood when the producer and directorweren't around. They didn't like him doing that.''   Sinatra, for whom Horn played flute on the hit ``Strangers inthe Night,'' was businesslike and a quick worker.   ``He'd rehearse once and then do one take,'' Horn recalled. ``Hemade it relaxed. He was a real pro.''   It was Horn's piccolo playing on the Beach Boys' hit ``GoodVibrations.''   ``People like their Hawaiian shirts and visualize themselves onthe sand with a beer in their hand,'' he said. ``The Beach Boysmake fun music and they didn't let it die.''   Horn, who lists his age as ``as old as the Beatles,'' was bornin Compton, Calif., and spent most of his life in Los Angeles.While living there, he played music in the movies ``Guess Who'sComing to Dinner'' starring Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and SidneyPoitier, ``Grease,'' ``Footloose,'' ``Shaft,'' ``Stayin' Alive''and many others.   He moved to Nashville four years ago and is now working on hisown album of sax instrumentals, ``Neon Nights.''   He learned how to play the piano at age 7, the trumpet at age 9and the sax at age 12.   ``The sax was a real popular instrument when I learned,'' hesaid. ``There was a sax solo on every record. I wanted my own bandand wanted to be able to do solos. I thought they were a whole lotof fun.''   He said he correctly developed his talent and always worked toget better.   ``I practiced a lot as a kid. I learned the proper way to play,then listened to albums, especially the sax solos, and played alongwith them. It gave me insight. I concentrated on my `ear.'''   Even today, he's constantly updating his style and listening tomusic for trends.   ``I hear songs on the radio and then I may change my style alittle,'' Horn said. ``But I have the same conviction. Somemusicians are lazy. They won't buy new equipment. You have tochange with the times. It's easier to relate to music that way. Ilisten to pop and rock on the radio a lot and switch back andforth.''   He owns seven saxes, four flutes and five recorders. His mostexpensive instrument is a $4,000 baritone sax.   Despite his success, some instruments have given him trouble. Heplayed the oboe and English horn for records by the Carpenters, butlater gave them up.   ``They were too demanding,'' he said. ``You had to make your owndouble reeds. It was too time consuming.''   And he can't master the harmonica, which even school kids canplay with little training.   ``I'm trying,'' he admitted. ``I can't get the hang of it. I'mused to blowing out.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 18-20</NOTE></DOC>
