But Jeffrey Moore, who invented the new combat suit, says it would actually lighten the infantryman's load. He says that in this age of high-tech warfare, it is &quot;the only answer -- either that or get the infantryman off the battlefield.&quot;    The uniform, which looks like a spacesuit, would protect its wearer from lasers, chemical and biological poisons, and nuclear radiation, Mr. Moore says. An internal air conditioner would keep the soldier cool, he says, and a tube in the helmet would feed the fighter on demand.    That is just the beginning. Mr. Moore says that the battery-powered rig would be able to read commands from the soldier's brain and relay them to a locomotive system in the suit, which would save the burdened soldier from having to walk on his own power. In fact, says Mr. Moore, who is an advanced-weapons engineer at the federally run Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the robotic suit could be &quot;taught to run at dash speeds.&quot;    What if the sensors misread signals and made the suit walk backward? What if the soldier daydreamed about going fishing or about his girlfriend? Don't worry, Mr. Moore says. Advances in magnetoencephalography -- the measurement of magnetic fields produced by neuron cells as they travel through the nervous system -- make it possible to &quot;recognize the neurons that govern muscle movement and filter out the signals coming from other neurons you're not interested in,&quot; he explains.    Recent experiments with monkeys proved this, he says. Unfortunately, scientists had to drill holes in the monkeys' skulls to intercept the motor signals, Mr. Moore notes, but in people, he says reassuringly, &quot;the firing neurons provide a magnetic field that extends beyond the skull.&quot;    The Army, which has been trying to shake a perception that it is an old-fashioned, low-tech sort of operation, is hesitant to dismiss the futuristic suit. &quot;It's worth exploring,&quot; says James Sampson, an operations analyst at the Army's research center in Natick, Mass. &quot;It's so science-fiction.&quot; So far, though, the Army has refused to provide money to the Los Alamos lab to build a prototype of the suit.    Other researchers are looking at simpler ways to lighten the soldier's load. An Army study group at Fort Lewis, Wash., recently cited the advantages of bringing back mules and wheelbarrows. Of course, it saw drawbacks: The Army would need trained mule handlers and mule food, the study said, although in some parts of the world &quot;native practitioners&quot; could be called in. Wheelbarrows, the study warned, were excellent on firm, flat soil but would themselves become burdens on mushy terrain or hills.    &quot;Mules and wheelbarrows aren't the answer,&quot; snaps Mr. Moore. &quot;Everybody is promoting their own theory, and the poor men on the ground get short shrift.&quot;    So far, nobody seems to have noted that soldiers could ease their burdens by carrying less. Their basic marching load includes a rifle with ammunition, a bayonet, a &quot;personal knife,&quot; a radio, a mask, three hand grenades, a quart of water, a flashlight, a container of face paint, a sleeping bag and pad, a ballistic vest, a pair of goggles, a rain suit, a food pack, extra socks, a compass, an antitank weapon and a towel.    During the 1983 invasion of Grenada, some soldiers hit the beach lugging as much as 120 pounds. Infantrymen responsible for communications equipment may carry loads of 160 pounds.    Ironically, the Army's new light-infantry division is one of the most weighed down, because it travels with fewer trucks. Defense Department officials say that during military exercises, some soldiers give in to the temptation to chuck some of the equipment. Still, several new items for soldiers to carry are in the wings. Army officials are working on new night-vision equipment, water purifiers and individual chemical detectors.    &quot;The state of the infantryman always suffers during peacetime,&quot; says James Dunnigan, a military historian and author of &quot;How to Make War.&quot; Once at a safe remove from the battlefield, he says, planners busy themselves with well-meant but onerous inventions.    Mr. Sampson at the Army's Natick lab worries that the proliferation of equipment will begin to show diminishing returns. Eventually, he says, the fully outfitted soldier &quot;will be defeated by an opposing soldier with a loincloth and spear.&quot; Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab recalls the fate of the heavily armored Normans in the Battle of Hastings: The English disemboweled their horses with axes, then went after their riders, who lay prostrate on the ground. (The colonel's point may be well-taken, but the Normans did rally to win the battle.)    Mr. Moore insists that his &quot;powered exoskeleton&quot; would increase, rather than diminish, battlefield effectiveness. He concedes, though, that the name of his futuristic suit isn't ideal. It is called Pitman. The Los Alamos lab relies on two lists of names for its projects -- astrological terms and automotive references. Since the former are reserved for the Star Wars projects Los Alamos works on, Mr. Moore turned to the menu of automotive names. A pitman is a member of a pit crew at an auto race.    Some Pitman fans say the project may have important spinoffs even if the suit never becomes standard garb for GIs. A former gunner in the Vietnam War says such a suit might have been useful in moving ammunition from runways there. Soldiers were exposed to attack as they unloaded 200-pound artillery shells. Pitman would have provided protection and, through what Mr. Moore calls its &quot;man amplifier&quot; characteristics, might have made it easier to lug the shells.    Los Alamos has other forward-looking projects. One is a five-inch antipersonnel missile that follows an enemy soldier around. &quot;You can't hide from it,&quot; swears Mr. Moore. &quot;It can turn corners. Even if you go into a foxhole, it'll explode right above.&quot;    He says that the only real protection from such a weapon is -- you guessed it -- the Pitman suit. </TEXT></DOC>
