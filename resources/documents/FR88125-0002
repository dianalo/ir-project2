Currentlysection 503 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (the Act) requires theFAA to establish and maintain a system for recording conveyances affectingtitle to, or interest in, civil aircraft. These documents include billsof sale, contracts of conditional sale, mortgages, and other security agreements.The Act also provides that no conveyance shall be valid against any personother than the persons involved in the conveyance, or a person who hasactual notice, until the conveyance affecting the aircraft is recordedwith the FAA.Under the Act, an aircraft may only be registered by its owner. Since 1939,as a result of the O'Conner decision (1 C.A.A. 5, 1939), the regulationshave recognized the buyer of an aircraft under a contract of conditionalsale as the owner for registration purposes. This is true even though theconditional seller retains legal title until the buyer meets the conditionsof the contract. The FAA considers certain leases with option to purchase,and bailment leases, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 1301(19), ``conditional sales'',to be equivalent to conditional sales and wherever the terms ``conditionalsales'' or ``conditional sales contract'' are used, they include thoseleases with option and bailment leases.Parts 47 and 49 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) historicallyhave recognized this special character of a contract of conditional sale.Section 47.11, Evidence of Ownership, requires the transferee under a contractof conditional sale to submit the contract (unless it is already recordedat the FAA Aircraft Registry (Registry)) and the transfer from the originalbuyer, bailee, lessee, or prior transferee. The transfer must bear thewritten assent of the seller, bailor, lessor, or transferee thereof underthe original contract. To obtain a certificate of aircraft registrationunder andSection; 47.31, the applicant must submit evidence of ownershipacceptable under andSection; 47.11.In addition, andSection;andSection; 47.11 and 49.17 provide that a transferof the conditional buyer's interest cannot be recorded and the aircraftcannot be registered to the buyer's transferee without the consent of theconditional seller. However, if a person holds any other kind of securityinterest in an aircraft, such as a security agreement, or a chattel mortgage,the consent of the secured party is not required for recordation of thetransfer and registration of the aircraft to the transferee.The Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C. or the code) makes no distinction betweencontracts of conditional sale and other security agreements. Section 1-201(37)of the code states that the retention or reservation of title by a seller,notwithstanding delivery of the property to the buyer, is limited in effectto a reservation of a ``security interest''. As provided in section 9-306of the U.C.C., a perfected security interest continues in the collateralregardless of sale or exchange by the debtor. Section 9-311 further statesthat the debtor's rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarilytransferred (by way of sale, creation of a security interest, attachment,levy, garnishment, or other judicial process) notwithstanding a provisionin the security agreement prohibiting any transfer of making the transferconstitute a default.<ITAG tagnum="84">ANPRM</ITAG>On August 11, 1975, the Cessna Finance Corporation (CFC) submitted a petitionfor rulemaking to the FAA. The CFC petition asks that Parts 47 and 49 bechanged to remove the distinction between the FAA's handling of conditionalsales contracts and its handling of other security instruments. This wouldbe done by requiring consent of the holder of every outstanding recordedsecurity interest prior to recording any bill of sale or other transferfrom the debtor to a third party, as a prerequisite to issuing a certificateof aircraft registration to the transferee.The CFC petition prompted the FAA to issue an advance notice of proposedrulemaking (ANPRM) on October 20, 1977 (Notice No. 77-24; 42 FR 55897).This notice, in keeping with the intent of the U.C.C. proposed to abolishthe distinction between contracts of conditional sale and other securityinterests recorded with the FAA. The FAA proposed to accomplish this, notin the manner requested by CFC, but by eliminating the requirement of writtenconsent of the conditional vendor to the transfer of the original buyer'sinterest before recording the transfer and registering the aircraft. TheFAA explained in the ANPRM that an amendment similar to the one proposedby CFC would discourage transfer of the buyer's interest in the aircraftand thus be contrary to the intent of the U.C.C. In addition, the amendmentwould involve a substantial increase in the administrative costs and workloadof the Registry. The ANPRM further solicited suggestions of alternativecourses of action which would be consistent with the U.C.C., administrativelyreasonable, and also afford protection to persons who hold security interestsin aircraft.Subsequent to the publication of the ANPRM, the Aircraft Finance Association(AFA) filed a petition for rulemaking, dated March 16, 1979, proposingthe same requirement as CFC requested. It did not specify, however, whenthe burden would fall upon the buyer of the aircraft to obtain the consentor release of the security interest by the creditor and when it would fallupon the seller.<ITAG tagnum="84">NPRM</ITAG>In response to the AFA petition and in further response to the CFC petition,the FAA published notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) No. 80-9 on May22, 1980 (45 FR 34286). The notice proposed to delegate regulations affordingspecial consideration to conditional sales contracts in view of modernstate statutes which, in accordance with the U.C.C., treat alike all instrumentsexecuted for security purposes as they concern the rights, duties, andremedies of the parties. Specifically, the notice proposed to amend andSection;47.11(a) by eliminating the requirement that the transferee under a contractof conditional sale submit with an Aircraft Registration Application, writtenassent of the seller, bailor, lessor, or assignee thereof, under the originalcontract, to the assignment. It also proposed to amend andSection; 49.17to eliminate the consent of the conditional seller and consolidate therecording requirements for instruments executed for security purposes.In support of the proposal, the FAA made the following observations. Formany years, the special character of the contract of conditional sale,i.e., the retention of legal title by the vendor, was thought to have warrantedthe special protection of consent to transfer. However, the Act does notspecifically authorize the Administrator to refuse to record a conveyanceaffecting title to, or an interest in, aircraft in the absence of a securedcreditor's assent to that conveyance. Section 503(c) of the Act leavesthe determination of the substantive validity of any conveyance to statelaw, specifically, the law of the state where the instrument is delivered.To the extent that the Act does not regulate the rights of parties to,and third parties affected by, these transactions, security interests inaircraft are controlled by Article 9 of the U.C.C., which has been adoptedin 49 of the 50 states.The NPRM noted that the CFC, the AFA, and the commenters to the ANPRM hadpointed out that the U.C.C. has eliminated the distinction between conditionalvendors and other secured creditors. In view of this virtually uniformpolicy of state law, the FAA stated, as it did in the ANPRM, that the distinctionshould be abolished for purposes of aircraft registration and recordation.The NPRM pointed to the policy of the U.C.C. that debtor's rights in collateralbe freely transferable notwithstanding a provision in a security agreementmaking such a transfer a default. The notice concluded that it would becontrary to the policy of the U.C.C. to restrain such transfers by requiring,as a condition of aircraft registration and recordation, the assent ofthe secured creditor to a conveyance of the aircraft. The FAA stated thatit is improper to override these state laws, in the absence of specificFederal statutory authority, unless it is necessary to carry out the provisionsof a Federal statute or treaty.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to the NPRM</ITAG>Forty-seven comments were received in response to the NPRM. Thirty-sevencommenters oppose the FAA proposal. Twenty of those 37 commenters ask thatCFC's proposal be implemented.Six commenters point out that insurance becomes invalid if ownership istransferred without the lienholder's knowledge. However, maintenance ofappropriate insurance is the responsibility of the owner of the aircraftand is not an FAA requirement. While operation of aircraft with appropriateinsurance coverage is desirable, and aircraft transfers do affect insurancecoverage and the security of the aircraft as collateral, the proposed regulationswould not affect the owner's responsibilities as to insurance.Twenty-four commenters contend that the proposed amendments would adverselyaffect aircraft financing and commerce. They contend that implementationof the changes proposed in the NPRM would relieve the mortgagor (conditionalbuyer, lessee, bailee, etc.) of the responsibility of providing eithera release of the security agreement or a consent from the security holder,allowing the free transfer of the debtor's interest. The commenters believethat the effect would be that the security holder might then not be awareof the impending transfer, and might not be able to protect its interestsor be assured of the continued safety of its collateral.Although the NPRM invited interested persons to submit data concerningany possible impact, no commenter did so. As stated in the NPRM, approximately15 percent of the security transactions filed with the Registry are contractsof conditional sale. The majority of those which require a release or consentto the sale of such aircraft have the required release or consent attached.Sellers who do not submit a release or consent with other documentationof the sale must be advised of the requirement, and this places an additionalburden on the Registry. This process impedes expeditious registration toa new buyer. By removing the requirement, a significant amount of timewill be saved by the seller, the security holder, and the FAA in documentingand processing such sales and the registration to subsequent buyers.Nothing the FAA can do will change the prospect that collateral may besold out of trust, with or without the security holder's consent. Whilethis final rule may remove an obstacle to a sale out of trust, the agencyis not persuaded that this will have an appreciable effect on secured transactionsgenerally. Some commenters suggest that removing the release or consentrequirement would increase the amount of down payment required in securedsales, or increase the amount of interest charged the buyer, or increasesecured party losses, or all three. However, no information in terms ofactual increases or events of transfer which result in loss were providedby the commenters, so these anticipated losses must be considered speculativeat this time.One commenter states that the proposed rule will affect a $6 billion industry.Other banks and aircraft financing concerns also commented that their respectiveinvolvement may total over one-half billion dollars a year. Many of theseconcerns state that they are currently carrying $50-100 million in outstandingobligations. However, no commenter states what proportion of their transactionswere conditional sales, if any, or how many conditional sales were affectedby sales out of trust.One commenter, citing section 9-104 of the U.C.C., stated that the U.C.C.does not apply to aircraft because a security interest in aircraft is subjectto a statute of the United States which governs the rights of the partiesto, and third parties affected by, the transaction. Section 9-103(3)(a)specifically names airplanes as one of the mobile goods covered by thecode. The Act provides a central location whereby recorded conveyancesand instruments shall be valid as to all persons without further or otherrecordation; however, it does not prescribe the rights, obligations, andremedies of the parties to the transactions.Three commenters stated that they did not believe security interests inaircraft were covered by the U.C.C. because section 9-302(3) specifiesthat the filing of a financing statement, otherwise required by Article9 of the code, is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interestin property subject to a statute or treaty of the United States which providesfor a national or international registration or specifies a different placefor filing a security interest. The FAA does not have a provision for thefiling of a ``notice'' of interest in aircraft (the financing statement),but rather section 503(a)(1) of the Act provides for the recording of theconveyance which contains all of the terms and provisions of the transactionaffecting an interest in aircraft. The Act provides a preempted locationfor recording security interests, but othewise does not displace the U.C.C.as to any substantive or procedural rights. <T3>Philko </T3>v. <T3>Shacket, </T3>103 S.Ct. 2476 (1983), <T3>In re Gary Aircraft, </T3>681 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1982), <T3>In re Holiday Airlines, </T3>620 F.2d 731 (9th Cir. 1980). The validityof any instrument is determined by state law, and in the event of default,remedies are in accordance with the provisions of the security instrumentand state law.The FAA does not expect the adoption of the amendment to have an appreciableeffect on the choice of security formats available to financers and theircustomers. The relations, obligations, and rights of the parties are mattersof mutual agreement. The agency action in treating all security transactionsalike should not have been an adverse effect on the reciprocal duties ofthe parties. Most security agreements, by whatever name they are called,contain provisions restricting transfers, perhaps restricting the baseor home location of the aircraft, and specifying events of default. FAAregulations and this amendment do not change these provisions; the obligationsof the parties remain the same. It should not be the responsibility ofthe FAA to participate in enforcing the terms of a financing transaction,but rather the parties themselves should select the security format, withits concomitant default and redress clauses, most appropriate to the wishesand needs of the parties.It appears that only the FAA has the requirement for submission of a consentor release prior to recognition of a sale. Such a requirement would seemto be unenforceable under any state law. The final rule does not changethe holder's right to have the security in the collateral continue notwithstandingthe sale, nor change specific contract language, if the contract containsany language to the effect that a sale may be an event of default. TheFAA recognizes that a sale by a conditional purchaser may result in theseller losing track of the collateral, but since the Registry records areopen to the public, the seller or other security holder can check on thecurrent registration at any time. The FAA places its records at the disposalof the public free of charge and in as expeditious a manner as possible.As a less sweeping alternative, some commenters suggest that notificationbe made to all lienholders when registration is transferred (as opposedto a refusal to transfer). However, the implementation of such an alternativewould be almost identical to implementation of the complete CFC proposalinsofar as increased workload is concerned, with questionable gain to thelienholder, to whom an after-the-fact notification may be untimely. Three commenters favor the proposal offered in the NPRM. All three opposethe cost of implementing and maintaining the procedures requested by CFC,and two object to the Government taking over the responsibility of furnishinginformation or a service presently available from the private sector, i.e.,the services of aviation title search companies.Finally, five commenters favor continuing the present procedure. Two statethat maintaining the ``status quo'' is preferable to the ``halfway'' measuresrequested by the CFC and changes should be made only if issuance of a ``clearand absolutely clean'' title replaced the present system. Two others wantno change only if CFC procedures could not be implemented. The fifth advocatesno change, saying the CFC proposal would only increase the backlog andprolong the time span required to issue a certificate of aircraft registration.The FAA has carefully considered all comments. However, since the U.C.C.has virtually eliminated any distinction between forms of security interestsand the Act provides no basis for such a distinction, the FAA is not justifiedin perpetuating by regulation, one distinction in one singular type oftransaction. The FAA is now fully persuaded that, since the validity ofthe instruments is governed by state law, and since state law prescribesthat collateral shall be fully transferable, regulations should be changedto reflect this law. Without an amendment to the Act specifically authorizingit to do so, the agency cannot continue an archaic practice that has beenspecifically changed in intent and in fact by the U.C.C.The expressed purpose of the Administration's regulatory program is toplace less, not more, responsibility on the Government for levying requirementson the public and enforcing those requirements. By requiring less documentationfor an aircraft transfer, which is subject to a conditional sales contract,the amendment will place all transferors and all holders of security interestson an equal footing; that is, nothing more will be required of personsselling an aircraft subject to a conditional sales contract than of personsselling an aircraft subject to a chattel mortgage or deed of trust. Similarly,a person holding a security interest called a conditional sales contractwill be in no different a position than the holder of any other agreement.Without specific statutory authority to continue the current practice,the FAA has concluded that Parts 47 and 49 should be amended by deletingthe requirement for a release or consent of the holder of a conditionalsales security interest prior to registration of an aircraft to a buyerwho purchases from a conditional sales vendee, or to record a transferfrom the same individual.Paragraph (a)(2) of andSection; 47.47, <T3>Cancellation of Certificate for Export Purposes, </T3>is being revisedto eliminate an unnecessary distinction between contracts of conditionalsale and other security agreements. These amendments, however, do not changethe requirement for a release or consent from the holders of all recordedrights when the aircraft registration is to be cancelled for export purposes.This requirement implements the Convention on the International Recognitionof Rights in Aircraft (4 U.S.T. 1830) (Convention), and is set out in andSection;47.47 of the FARs. In 1985, over 2,000 U.S. registered aircraft were exported,and consents or releases were provided in all cases where the aircraftwere subject to recorded rights. This requirement is placed on all exportedaircraft regardless of whether the aircraft is being exported to a countrywhich is also a signatory to the Convention.<ITAG tagnum="84">Editorial Changes From the NPRM</ITAG>Editorial changes have been made to the Part 49 amendment from the languageof the NPRM in the following manner: all references to ``mortgage'', or``chattel mortgage'', have been changed to the more generic term, ``securityagreement''. This is the term generally accepted by the U.C.C. to referto such instruments, regardless of the historical name; names are not criticalfor recording purposes. Similarly, wherever reference is made to ``FAArecorded document number'', that is changed to ``FAA recorded conveyancenumber'' in accordance with current Registry practice.Although the NPRM stated that the proposed amendment would not affect andSection;47.47(a), which deals with the requirements of the Convention on InternationalRecognition of Rights in Aircraft (4 U.S.T. 1830), editorial changes aremade to remove those requirements in that section that distinguish conditionalsales contract from other security instruments. Under andSection; 47.47(a)the requirement remains exactly the same: All recorded security instrumentsmust be released or have the consent to cancel registration from the holderof the instrument. This is meant to be an editorial change only, and nosubstantive change is intended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Benefit-Cost Analysis</ITAG>The FAA is amending Parts 47 and 49 of the FAR's to eliminate the currentrequirement for a release or consent from the holder of a conditional salessecurity interest to registration of an aircraft to a conditional salesbuyer. These amendments would treat conditional sales contract the sameas other security agreements in which the FAA does not require the consentof the secured party to record the transfer and registration of the aircraftto the buyer. A conditional sales contract is one in which the buyer andseller agree to fulfill certain conditions; e.g., observe warranties, provideproper maintenence, meet a payment schedule. The buyer takes possessionof the aircraft and registers it with the FAA even though the seller retainslegal title until all the conditions of the contract are satisfied.Registry experience is that about 15 percent of aircraft security documentsare conditional sales contracts, generally involving 4,725 aircraft onan annual basis. Although this proportion is small, it appears that someof the major lenders in the industry rely heavily on this type of financialarrangement. Both Cessna Finance and Chase Manhattan Aircraft Finance,which acquired Piper Acceptance Corporation in 1985, have indicated thatthe bulk of their aviation lending consists of conditional sales contracts.Both of those companies also indicated that 20 percent of these contractswere to the dealer for inventory financing and 80 percent went to the enduser. In the case of an end user conditional sales contract, the dealerwill ``assign'' the contract to the lender. Although information on individualaviation lenders' use of this type of contract format is very sketchy,it appears that perhaps about half a dozen aviation lenders have significantvolume of conditional sales contracts.The FAA expects that adoption of the proposal would facilitate the saleof used aircraft by requiring less documentation for an aircraft transfersubject to a previously recorded conditional sales contract. As noted above,approximately 15 percent of all security contracts are conditional saleswhich require the additional documentation. Another expected benefit ofthis amendment is a reduced workload for the Registry because it wouldeliminate the need for returning and resubmitting transfer documents whenthe necessary consents are lacking. This saving in time is not expectedto be very significant, however, in view of the fact that only 5 percentof all conditional sales transfer documents (or less than 250 per year)must be returned by the FAA because the required releases have not beenobtained.Another benefit of this rule is consistent treatment of loan collateralinvolved in conditional sales of aircraft between Federal regulation andthe state U.C.C.'s. The U.C.C. makes no distinction between contracts ofconditional sale and other forms of security agreements. The validity ofthe loan instruments is governed by state law and because state law prescribesthat collateral shall be fully transferable, the Federal regulation shouldbe consistent.A half dozen conditional sales lenders were contacted by the FAA. Theyprefer conditional sales contracts because of the additional protectionof the collateral in the form of ``registration around liens'', under whichthe FAA will not change registration of an aircraft without the consentof the lienholder. Under a standard loan arrangement, the FAA does notrequire such a consent prior to registering the aircraft in the name ofthe purchaser. Some lenders are critical of the proposed rule, claimingit would increase their risk exposure. The lenders assert that they wouldotherwise have no indication that the borrower was attempting to sell orhad sold the collateral and would therefore be forced to search the Registryrecords to determine if a sale had in fact occurred. Also lenders mightlose their collateral insurance because policies terminate with the saleof aircraft. Lenders assert they would be forced to change the terms onaircraft loans by increasing rates and down payment requirements whichwould ultimately reduce the overall volume of their aviation loan portfolios.They indicated that the degree of this change would depend largely on theirloss experience which cannot be predicted at this time.The FAA does not expect the adoption of the amendment to have a significanteffect on the risk exposure of aviation lenders using the conditional salesformat, however. In the first place, the protection of collateral affordedby the FAA requirement for the consent of the lien-holder is not availablein the case of conditional sales contract to dealers for inventory financingbecause the lien would not be enforceable under the state U.C.C.'s afterthe dealer sells to an end user. Under the U.C.C., a person who buys anaircraft from a dealer takes title to the aircraft free and clear of anysecurity interest in the aircraft. (U.C.C. 9-307(1).)On the other hand, a person who purchases an aircraft from a person whois not in the business of selling aircraft, i.e., the original purchaserwould be legally obligated to release the collateral to the lender in theevent the conditional buyer of the aircraft, i.e., the debtor, defaultedon his payments. Effects of this proposal therefore appear limited to ``enduser'' loans.Conditional sales lenders have expressed concern that implementation ofthe proposal would force them to institute replevin proceedings (whichwould take up to 2 years) to recover the collateral in the event of a default,thereby delaying the process and increasing their cost and risk exposure.The FAA maintains that the lenders would not generally be required to followthis protracted course because state laws entitle them to repossess propertyon which they hold a lien without breaching the peace. Replevin proceedingsare not likely to increase since the law presumes that the buyer has knowledgeof any debt or security agreement recorded by the Registry that may encumberany purchased aircraft.In summary, the adoption of the proposal is not expected to have a significantimpact on the risk exposure of the lenders. Even if the aircraft is soldout of trust, the lender retains a lien of record on the aircraft in thecase of nondealer sales and remains in the same priority with respect toother persons asserting rights in the aircraft. While the possibility existsthat FAA may register aircraft to buyers from conditional vendees, therebycreating legal problems for some lenders, lenders can adequately protectrights to the collateral by specifying the obligations of the parties inthe loan agreements. The FAA is not persuaded that the terms of loans willbe adversely affected by the implementation of this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The FAA has determined that the rulemaking action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.As noted above, the risks of conditional sales agreements involving aircraftdealers would probably not be affected. The cost of new aircraft to commercialoperators of all sizes, which to some extent reflects the financing costsof dealers, would therefore not be affected. Any possible effects on thecost of used aircraft are likely to be minimal in view of the prevalenceof the standard ``chattel'' loan format in the aircraft purchase financingindustry which would not be affected by this action. <ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impacts</ITAG>The Registry is aware of only one foreign aircraft manufacturer which specificallyselected the conditional sale format for sales to its U.S. distributorsin order to take advantage of the requirement for a release or consentbefore further transfer would be recognized. However, since a purchaserfrom a dealer takes possession free and clear of any dealer financing,regardless of FAA's requirements, no impact can be shown other than inthose situations where the distributor transfers the aircraft to anotherdealer. This manufacturer did not comment on the proposed rule change.Accordingly, the FAA has determined that the economic impact of the amendmenton international trade would be minimal and imposes no significant barrier.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>This amendment will provide consistent treatment of aircraft subject tosecurity agreements and result in a minimal cost benefit by requiring lessdocumentation for the registration of certain used aircraft. It is notexpected to have a significant impact on the risk exposure of lenders.For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this amendment is not majorunder Executive Order 12291 or significant under the Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Forthe same reasons, it is certified that under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act this amendment will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of entities.
