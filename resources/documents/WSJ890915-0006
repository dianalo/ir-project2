Despite protests from state officials and environmentalists, the New York oil company has long insisted work would stop Sept. 15 on the grounds that unpredictable weather after today makes continued operations hazardous. In anticipation of that self-imposed deadline, Exxon began laying off workers and packing up equipment early this month.    The company said its final tally shows it worked on 1,089 miles of shoreline in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska that were fouled after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in March.    The company said its chairman, Lawrence Rawl, visited cleanup areas this week and, with President Lee Raymond, reviewed results with Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and other state officials. Mr. Rawl declared hundreds of miles of shoreline &quot;are certainly what most people would consider clean.&quot; He said some areas still have oil residue but are safe for fish and wildlife. &quot;This is a remarkable change from conditions I saw during my visit in early April,&quot; he said.    Exxon reiterated that it will keep 300 people in the state, primarily studying the cleanup's effectiveness with an eye toward what work, if any, is needed in the spring. They will also be available to keep oil from environmentally sensitive areas. Exxon said 250 contract personnel and boats, helicopters, aircraft and equipment are on standby, as well.    Separately, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm disclosed a study that concludes that despite the public attention generated by the Exxon Valdez disaster, the number of oil tanker spills in U.S. waters isn't rising. Since 1978, the number of major spills has averaged six to seven a year, with a high of 16 in 1979 and a low of two in 1982, according to World Information Systems. The study defines a spill of at least 10,000 gallons as major. The Valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude.    &quot;Although massive spills can cause extensive environmental and economic damage, they remain low-probability events,&quot; said Richard Golob, the firm's president. Of the 78 major tanker spills since 1978, seven involved a loss of one million gallons or more, the study found.    Meanwhile, a report by the attorney general of Washington state concluded that the Exxon Valdez oil spill didn't cause the rapid rise in gasoline prices after the spill. Other factors -- such as a surge in crude oil prices, West Coast refinery shutdowns and increased demand -- were responsible, the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
