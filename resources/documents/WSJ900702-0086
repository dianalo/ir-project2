Altogether, Prospect shareholders will receive interestsin eight companies, ranging from a railroad-holding companyand a mushroom producer to a distributor of Swiss ArmyKnives. But because some of the companies aren't public, theexact value of the assortment isn't yet clear.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This was a difficult company to understand,&quot; a spokesmandeclared, explaining in part why Prospect chose to break upthe unusual conglomerate. For some time, officials havemaintained that the stock market didn't recognize theunderlying value of Prospect's various assets.   Because &quot;several assets don't have a public market, theirvalue isn't readily apparent,&quot; said Michael Millman, analystat Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;Until the liquidation, theshareholders didn't know how they would directly andspecifically benefit from the operations.&quot;   Mr. Millman gives management high marks, however, forbuilding Prospect's group of businesses. &quot;The negative of theliquidation is that shareholders can't participate&quot; anylonger with Prospect's investment managers, the analyst said.   Prospect went public in May 1986 at $9.75 a share;shareholders approved the liquidation plan Wednesday at theannual meeting here. Of the 22 million shares eligible tovote on the liquidation plan, 18 million voted and more than90% of those approved the transaction. In nationalover-the-counter trading Friday, its shares closed at$17.625, down 12.5 cents.   Terms of the liquidation require Prospect's managers todistribute its assets within three years. If some assetsremain after that time, they will be placed in a trust anddistributed by the trustees.   Earlier this year, Prospect holders received one share ofIllinois Central Corp. for each two Prospect shares, a totalof 62% of the Chicago freight-railroad holding company. A fewshares were held for stock-option programs for Prospectexecutives who also held directorships at Illinois Central.   The Illinois Central stock will trade in tandem withProspect's until the railroad's shares receive a separateover-the-counter listing. Prospect's spokesman expects therailroad's shares to begin trading separately in August orSeptember.   In the liquidation, Prospect also will convert its smallpreferred-stock holding of MidSouth Corp., a Jackson, Miss.,freight railroad, to common stock, and holders will receivethose shares. In 1987, Prospect distributed its MidSouthcommon shareholdings; the new allocation will give Prospectholders substantially all MidSouth's common. In nationalover-the-counter trading Friday, MidSouth shares fell 25cents to $8.75.   Prospect shareholders also will get stakes in:   -- Sylvan Foods Holdings Inc. Prospect's holders willreceive one share of the Worthington, Pa., mushroom producerfor about each 10 of their shares. Prospect will seek an OTClisting for Sylvan's shares.   -- Children's Discovery Centers of America Inc. Prospectholders will receive a 1-for-10 distribution, or a total of50%, of the San Rafael, Calif., operator of childcarecenters. CDCA last traded over the counter Wednesday and wasquoted at $3 bid.   -- Forschner Group Inc. Prospect holders will receive a1-for-10 distribution, equal to a total of 58%, of theexclusive U.S. distributor of the Swiss Army Knife. Based inShelton, Conn., Forschner trades national OTC; the sharesclosed Friday at $11, down 25 cents.   -- Ivy Insurance Group Inc. Prospect wholly owns thisPasadena, Calif., auto-insurance company and is seeking tosell it. Prospect, which bought it in July 1988 from KemperCorp. of Chicago, may have a problem selling this unitbecause in November 1988, California's voters radicallytightened the laws regulating property/casualty insurers.   Sometime in the future, Prospect will distribute holdingsin:   -- Recognition Equipment Inc., a Dallas manufacturer ofdocument-processing equipment. Prospect holds 1,431,800shares and a $15 million 10% senior subordinated noteconvertible into 1,666,667 shares. Prospect &quot;believesRecognition is trading at a depressed value and is aturnaround situation,&quot; the company's spokesman said. In NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, the company'sshares rose 50 cents, to $5.50.   -- Noel Group Inc., a New York natural-resources andenergy company. Prospect holds 1,909,090 shares, a 19% stake,plus one million more that it will receive when Noel Groupexercises an option to buy Wood River Capital Corp., a NewYork small-business investment company, from Prospect. NoelGroup is controlled by Louis Marx Jr. of New York, who untilJan. 19, 1990, was chairman of the Prospect board's assetcommittee. Noel is expected to go public in the next two orthree years, Prospect's spokesman said.   Prospect had an about 60% interest in National SpiritGroup Inc., a Dallas operator of cheerleader camps, and inFebruary definitively agreed to sell it to BSN Corp. for $40million. The deal fell through in April, however, and laterthat month, National Spirit Group filed under Chapter 11 ofthe federal Bankruptcy Code.</TEXT></DOC>
