In London, the 100-share index advanced 23.2 points to 2383.1, and the Financial Times 30-share index surged 19.4 points to 1874.4. Volume narrowed to 769.1 million shares from 793.8 million shares Tuesday.    Stocks were bolstered by cautious optimism about the economy and big rises in selective stocks.    Dealers said investors' fears of higher interest rates have lessened somewhat because of a generally optimistic outlook for the British economy released Tuesday in a report by the Confederation of British Industry.    But some dealers said market participants will remain skeptical about interest rates at least until the release of United Kindgom trade figures for June, scheduled Aug. 11.    Foremost among the day's big gainers was ICI PLC, which rose 16 pence to #15.50 ($24.85) ahead of the company's report Thursday of second-quarter results.    Mechanical engineers Hawker Siddeley soared 50 pence to 630 pence on rumors that BTR PLC might launch a takeover bid. BTR rose two pence to 337 pence.    Oil stocks had big gains. Dealers said the shares had been oversold in recent session. Mining shares also advanced.    Shares in recently privatized BAA fell five pence to 141 pence partly paid on lack of interest, a dealer said. Only 28 million shares were traded, compared with 134 million shares on the first day of official dealings Tuesday. BOC Group rose 24 pence to 552 pence; the company said it signed a letter of intent to sell its U.S. carbon graphite business at book value to Horsehead Industries. Analysts said the business has been hurt by volatile trading conditions in recent years.    Frankfurt shares ended higher, boosted by heavy foreign and domestic institutional buying, but profit-taking erased some of the gains.    Trading focused on Deutsche Bank, which reported a 57% drop in first-half partial operating earnings from the record year-earlier period. The stock fell seven marks at the opening, but recovered by midday and ended at 645.8 marks ($348.27), down 1.2 marks.    Other bank shares continued to firm despite lower first-half earnings. Dresdner Bank gained two marks to 339.5 marks, and Commerzbank was up one mark to 290.5 marks.    Machinery makers were battered by news that orders to the industry plunged 13% in June from a year earlier. Machinery orders fell 6% in May. Linde declined 6.5 marks to 741 marks, Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz slipped 3.8 marks to 170 marks and Man shed 1.5 marks to 188.5 marks. But Mannesmann rose 1.5 marks to 175 marks.    Chemicals and auto shares were slightly higher.    Retailing issues gained on hopes of strong turnover at the start of the summer sales period, with Karstadt climbing nine marks to 529 marks, and Kaufhof rising 7.7 marks to 508.2 marks.    In Tokyo, prices edged higher, led by export-dependent machine tool and pharmaceutical shares.    The Nikkei stock average rose 41.30 points to 24427.12. Turnover increased to one billion shares from 750 million shares Tuesday. Gainers outnumbered losers, 538 to 393.    In the electrical-computer sector, Kyocera surged 180 yen to 6,480 yen ($43.11), Alps Electric rose 120 yen to 2,820 and Sony rose 30 yen to 4,600 yen.    Auto makers also rose strongly.    Machine tool shares rose despite a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading business newspaper, that said the number of machine tools exported to the U.S. under Japan's voluntary restraint agreement program during the second half will be only 50% as much as the first half. The high yen was blamed for the decline.    Certain pharmaceutical issues continued to gain in the recent run-up in share prices.Ono Pharmaceutical soared 360 yen to 7,880 yen, Banyu Pharmaceutical gained 140 yen to 1,830 yen and Kaken Pharmaceutical surged 60 yen to 1,980.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Jul 28     Jul 27     Year    U.S. ....................... 290.6       289.0   + 27.4    Britain .................... 709.0       696.1   + 42.5    Canada ..................... 441.6       440.2   + 32.5    Japan ..................... 1204.8      1192.6   + 27.5    France ..................... 424.2       423.3   +  3.9    Germany .................... 240.0       238.1   -  7.6    Hong Kong ................. 2386.2      2388.8   + 34.1    Switzerland ................ 203.4       200.0   +  1.3    Australia .................. 370.6       373.5   + 40.4    World index ................ 462.8       460.5   + 29.7</TEXT></DOC>
