In a wide-ranging package covering activities by executivebranch employees as well as judges and Congress, Bush proposedchanges in the campaign finance laws.   He said current law that allows lawmakers to convert campaignfunds to personal use should be abandoned because leftoverpolitical donations ``should not become a kind of individualretirement account for members of Congress.''   The law now allows anyone who held office before 1980 to useleftover campaign contributions for any lawful purpose, includingpersonal use.   The president also called for elimination of campaigncontributions by special-interest political action committees.   ``We've allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowedby special interests ... and I believe we should eliminatecontributions to candidates by PACs,'' he said.   His announcement today was an attempt to fulfill his pledge tobring higher ethical standards to government.   ``You're never going to legislate away impropriety,'' Bush saidin a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors conventionwhere he announced the proposals. ``But these values in ethics canbe encouraged, respected.''   In a question session with the ASNE members, Bush said he stillconsiders Oliver North, the former National Security Council aide,a national hero because ``anybody that gets a Purple Heart, shedshis blood fighting for his couuntry, deserves to be called anAmerican hero.''   But he said, ``the last thing I want to do is intervene'' in theongoing case in which North is standing trial on charges he lied toCongress and destroyed government documents in the Iran-Contra case.   Bush also said in answer to a question that the reason he isfriendly and social with reporters is not to ``seduce'' them intofavorable coverage.   ``We're treating them as human beings ... I want to treat thepress with the dignity to which it is entitled.''   In a message to Congress accompanying his ethics package, thepresident said, ``The proposals represent an effort to communicatedefinitive ethical standards to federal employees throughout ourgovernment.''   Bush's package included an executive order to cover executivebranch employees and a legislative proposal to give judges a 25percent pay raise, coupled with the honoraria ban for judges.   An honoraria ban already applies to executive branch officials,and in his speech the president said he wants to extend it toCongress. However, he did not include such a package in thelargislative package, saying he wanted to take it up at a futuretime in connection with a congressional pay raise.   Bush's decision not to propose a congressional honoraria banprompted criticism that he is letting Congress off easy, by notseeking to bar the speaking fees that enrich lawmakers' $89,500annual salaries.   Fred Wertheimer, president of the civic action group CommonCause, said Bush ``caved in to pressure by members of Congress whowant to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and itappears the president doesn't have the courage of his convictions.''   Common Cause supports a pay raise for Congress and opposes allhonoraria on the ground they promote excessive influence by thespecial interest groups that pay members of Congress for speeches.   Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its reportMarch 10, endorsed a ban on honoraria for all three branches ofgovernment.   The president backed a 51 percent pay raise previously, butCongress itself voted against giving its members a raise this year.   While turning down the congressional honoraria recommendation,Bush is accepted a commission recommendation to bar members ofCongress members and senior personnel in the judicial andcongressional branches who leave the government from lobbying theirformer offices for one year. Executive branch employees already aresubject to such a ban.   The commission was created by Bush to recommend changes ingovernment ethics rules. It reviewed matters such as outsideincome, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure andpost-employment lobbying.   In the order covering the executive branch, Bush barred seniorgovernment officials from serving on the boards of profit-makingenterprises. He proposed that the ban be extended to congressionaland judicial officials as well.   The executive order also would give elevated rank to adesignated ethics officer in each department, and would do awaywith ``compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of theexecutive branch for purpose of lobbying after working for thegovernment.   That means that executive branch workers, currently barred for ayear from lobbying their former office once they leave thegovernment, would be under the same restriction regarding all thedepartments of the executive branch.   Full-time presidential appointees, White House employees andOffice of Policy Development employees also would be barred fromreceiving any outside income.</TEXT></DOC>
