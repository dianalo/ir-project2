Butstocks rose and bonds held even in thin, pre-holidayactivity.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.57 points toclose at 2899.26. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond pricesfinished unchanged.</LP><TEXT>   Adding to the expectation of lower bond prices was astronger-than-expected gain in the Purchasing Managers Index,an indicator of activity in the economy's industrial sector.Any signs of economic strength have been bearish for bondslately because the Federal Reserve would be less likely tolower interest rates.   Higher commodities prices also can hurt bonds, becausethey suggest higher inflation, which undercuts the value ofbond yields. Soybeans and some precious metals were amongcommodity-price gainers, but crude oil prices fell.   &quot;I thought bonds would trade off a bit more on the PMIreport,&quot; said Michael H. Sherman, investment strategist atShearson Lehman Hutton. Anyone expecting the Fed to easeinterest rates soon would have to have second thoughts afterthat report, he said.   Several analysts said the low volume of trading in thestock market made yesterday's advance in the industrialaverage suspect. &quot;It's a very light week, and movements arebeing exaggerated,&quot; said James Awad, president of BMICapital.   The only major burst of activity came on buy programs --in which stock-index futures are sold and baskets of theunderlying stocks are purchased to profit on brief pricediscrepancies between the two markets.   Helping buoy prices, Mr. Awad said, was renewed interestin takeover possibilities in the wake of news that GeneralInstrument Corp. is being taken private by a leveragedbuy-out led by Forstmann, Little andamp; Co.   &quot;People are saying maybe LBOs are finished,&quot; Mr. Awadsaid, &quot;but all-cash strategic acquisitions of companies --many of them undervalued -- should provide positive supportin the market.&quot;   But if the dollar continues weakening and commoditiesprices keep climbing, the stock market could feel the pinchsoon, said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysisgroup at Salomon Brothers. &quot;There may be consequences forstocks and bonds after we return from the holiday,&quot; he said.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices rose on light volume of 130.2 million sharesin New York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues edgedout decliners, 775 to 744.                                                                                                          Bond prices were little changed. The yield on theTreasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.40%.</TEXT></DOC>
