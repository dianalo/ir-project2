Airtightness tests were conducted using thefan-depressurization method and the results were compared by province,builder, house style, and house size. The survey shows considerable variationsin the leakiness of the houses when the results are compared by province.Less variation in airtightness exists when the houses are compared bybuilder, house style, and house size on a provincial basis. The resultssuggest that builders in Canada should have little difficulty in constructinghouses with a 50% improvement in the level of airtightness at littleextra cost. 6 refs., 6 figs., 35 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
