Stevens and Michael R. </HL><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP FREST JAPAN CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   February's Louvre accord started to show its other side last week as central banks of the U.S. and some Western European allies moved jointly to slow the dollar's rise.    When government officials reached the agreement in Paris six months ago, they said their main aim was stability in exchange rates. The accord was first invoked this spring in a vigorous defense of the dollar as market forces were pushing it to new lows.    But with the dollar having recovered as much as 10% from those lows, the agreement is being used to the opposite effect now. For the first time in more than a year, central banks have banded together to restrain a dollar rebound.    &quot;The Louvre agreement should work in both directions, and so far the intervention is very much in line with the purpose of the agreement,&quot; an official of the Bundesbank, the West German central bank, said.    Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bundesbank, Bank of England and Bank of France -- plus the Swiss National Bank, which wasn't a party to the Paris accord -- sold about $1 billion of the U.S. currency in foreign exchange markets, a central bank source said.    Although that effort clearly cooled the speculative spirit in the market, it didn't prevent the dollar from climbing 1.8% against the West German mark. And for the short term, traders remain bullish on the dollar.    One reason is that the current round of intervention is still so much smaller than the earlier one. When the dollar plunged to 137 Japanese yen and about 1.76 marks this spring, the central banks bought nearly $40 billion within a month. The Bank of Japan alone absorbed as much $1 billion in a single day.    &quot;Guys have kind of pooh-poohed the intervention so far,&quot; Daniel E. Holland, a currency trader at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    A trader at a bank that dealt with the Fed last week said that each time the Fed's selling pushed the dollar down, &quot;it took less and less time&quot; for the currency to bounce back to the level at which the Fed had sold it.    Nicholas P. Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., said the central bank action last week &quot;can be characterized as leaning against the wind.&quot;    The central banks were pressed back into action partly by the recent bullish market for the dollar amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. The threat of a wider conflict in the Persian Gulf region spurred investors to buy dollars as a safe haven currency.    Meanwhile, some economic factors also have begun favoring the dollar. By certain measures, the U.S. is outpacing its major trading partners in economic growth. That view gained support with Friday's report that U.S. non-farm employment rose last month by 304,000, which was as much as 50% more than some forecasts.    Interest rates also are helping the dollar, with current 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields two pecentage points above those on equivalent West German government bonds, twice the spread that was available last spring.    &quot;It's perfectly justifiable for the dollar to go up in the short term,&quot; Arthur C. Agostini, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    Earlier market speculation that the central banks may be defending an undisclosed &quot;target zone&quot; or trading range for the dollar has largely yielded to official statements to the contrary. The recent intervention is believed instead to be part of an international switch toward more active management of exchange rates that stops short of specific target zones.    Central banks &quot;aren't holding (the dollar) from going up,&quot; Mr. Agostini said. &quot;They just want to keep the rise orderly and purge the speculative element out of the market.&quot;    One danger of a speculative rally in the dollar is that if the currency becomes overbought, panic selling could ultimately ensue, throwing it into a free fall.    &quot;They know that probably the higher it goes, the farther it will crash,&quot; Mr. Agostini said.    The Bundesbank official, who requested anonymity, said policy makers would be happy to see the dollar remain stable. Although the dollar has generally declined since early 1985, the expected benefit of smaller imbalances in international trade and payments accounts has only recently begun to appear, he said.    &quot;All nations agree that it's not in anyone's interest to see this process reversed or stopped,&quot; he said.    Some nations' interests are served more than others, however. The Bundesbank's sale of dollars to buy marks helps West Germany ease the pressure of a rapid growth in its money supply, which is inflationary. &quot;It's fair to say the intervention . . . doesn't pose any policy dilemmas for the Bundesbank. Clearly, domestic and external considerations converge here,&quot; the central bank official said.    Japan, on the other hand, has seen its export-driven economy suffer significantly from the dollar's decline, and hasn't joined in the latest intervention effort. Because of the dollar's rebound, &quot;in Tokyo, people are comfortable and breathing easier after 24 months of turmoil,&quot; said Ariyoshi Okumura, chief economist at Industrial Bank of Japan.    That reprieve may be short-lived. Rising inflation and continuing large trade and federal budget deficits are expected to bring the dollar back down in the long run. The strengthening U.S. currency faces a critical test this Friday when the Commerce Department releases merchandise trade data for June.    &quot;The fundamentals are against an upward valuation of the dollar,&quot; said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. To achieve longer-term dollar stability, economists say, the U.S. current account -- a broad based measure of trade in goods and services -- must improve significantly and the U.S. budget deficit must recede.    Mr. Ramm and other economists predict the U.S. budget deficit will decline this year to about $180 billion from $212 billion in 1986. That is partly because of changes in the U.S. tax code that broadened the tax base while lowering tax rates. Also, stronger-than-expected growth has increased federal revenue. But Mr. Ramm predicts the deficit will climb $10 billion to $15 billion in 1988.    Mr. Ramm has another reason to be gloomy about the dollar longer-term: the likelihood of Reagan administration battles with Congress over protectionist trade legislation.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar overcame coordinated central bank efforts to stem its recent rise, finishing higher against most major currencies.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8933 marks, up from 1.8836 Thursday, and at 151.78 yen, up from 151.45. The British pound fell to $1.5645 from $1.5773.    The Federal Reserve, Bundesbank and Bank of England sold dollars in the open market Friday. The Bundesbank also made an official $10.1 million sale at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $13.40 an ounce to $454.60 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was five million ounces.
