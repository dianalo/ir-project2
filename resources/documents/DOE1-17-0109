It is often asserted (but was not published) thatthe earliest NMR study in vivo was performed by Bloch who placed hisfinger into the NMR probe and obtained a proton signal from the digit.In vitro tissue studies were occasionally reported during the 1950s and1960s. It was, however, the reports of Damadian and his co-workers inthe early 1970s describing differences in proton relaxation times betweennormal and pathological tissues, which initiated the great surge of interestin the application of NMR to biological and medical studies. These studieshave culminated in the widespread use of NMR spectroscopy and especiallyof imaging which we see today. NMR is applicable to the study of a lagenumber of nuclei, some of these, such as 31-phosphorus and 23-sodium,being of direct biological importance. The great majority of biologicalstudies have, however, concentrated on the hydrogen nucleus, or proton,and the following discussion is limited to proton NMR studies.</TEXT></DOC>
