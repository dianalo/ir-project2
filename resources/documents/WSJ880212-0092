First Houston Bank, Houston, was closed and its $28 million in insured deposits were transferred to Texas Commerce Bank, also of Houston, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.    Texas Commerce is purchasing a portion of the failed bank's $33.9 million in assets for $1.6 million. First Houston's office won't reopen; its insured deposits were to be made available today at Texas Commerce's River Oaks branch. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds of liquidating the failed bank's assets.    Also closed was First State Bank, Oilton, Okla., with assets of $11.8 million. Its sole office was scheduled to open today as a branch of American National Bank of Bristow, Bristow, Okla., which is assuming its $11.7 million in deposits, keeping $8.8 million of its assets and getting $2.7 million from the FDIC. </TEXT></DOC>
