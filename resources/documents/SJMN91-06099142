And it must looksomething like this: Against the backdrop of the Oakland night sky, thetwinkle of camera flashes and the blinking lights of the Coliseum scoreboard,Henderson dives headfirst into the base and thrusts it triumphantly overhead.To a roaring standing ovation, his teammates rush out to mob him. The game ishalted. Presentations are made. His mother joins him on the field, and the A'swheel out a new Ferrari and hand him the keys. And all the while a careerretrospective plays on the big screen.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WILL SPRING OF DISCONTENT OVERSHADOW RICKEY'SFEAT?  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Opening Day EXTRASpecial 4-page pullout section -- plus more sports insideRickey's Assault on History  </MEMO><TEXT>     And although the A's have balked at the symbolism of a new Ferrari -- andHenderson was labeled as greedy last spring for complaining because the carwasn't included in his contract -- there was every reason to believe he wouldenjoy a reasonable facsimile of that moment until this spring.;    RickeyHenderson is three bases away from becoming baseball's all-time steals leader.If he had set the record in 1990, it might have been lost amid the stories ofa spring lockout, Nolan Ryan's 300th win, Pete Rose's incarceration and thenine no-hitters. But this could have been his moment alone.;    Instead,Henderson has managed to overshadow himself. His feud with A's ownership overhis four-year, $12 million contract cast clouds over the A's spring trainingcamp and cast Henderson as a greedy, self-centered bad guy on the eve ofperhaps the greatest moment in his career.;    It's possible, even probablenow, that Henderson will be booed by his hometown crowd when he sets therecord. And he says he doesn't care.;    &quot;When I look up there and see my mamajumping around, my daughter jumping around, everybody else can be quiet ifthey want to. That's all we need,&quot; Henderson said. &quot;This record doesn'tconcern them. It doesn't concern anybody but Rickey Henderson, really.&quot;;   The A's remain uncertain just how they'll honor Henderson, and part of theirreticence is linked to public perceptions about Henderson's behavior thisspring.;    A's General Manager Sandy Alderson doesn't think the moment willbe separated from Henderson's contractual problems.;    &quot;I'd be very surprisedif it didn't have some effect on the anticipation of it (the record),&quot;Alderson said.;    Throughout his career, Henderson's accomplishments havebeen tarnished by his actions. He has been accused of giving less than fulleffort when he's unhappy. He's been labeled a hotdog because of his snatchcatches and his style of play. Almost every injury has been suspect.;    Now,even his teammates seem to think he should stick by the contract he signed,although they're careful to speak in generalities. Henderson professes not tocare how even his own teammates will behave when he sets the record.;    &quot;It'smy record, it's not your record. . . . It's not my teammates' record. Thereisn't anybody that did it but one person. You can't say it's a team thing,&quot;Henderson said.;    Henderson has threatened not to talk to reporters after hesets the record, and he's admittedly not happy right now. But he continues toinsist that this moment is not ruined.;    &quot;It's still going to be a joyousmoment. If I'm (mad) until the day I do it, the moment is going to be joyful,&quot;he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KIM BOATMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910408  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  593  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 8, 199100099142,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
