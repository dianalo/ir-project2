The government did not confirm reports from Honduras andWashington that Sandinista troops pursued U.S.-backed Contra rebelsinto Honduran territory during an offensive in northern Nicaragua.   However, President Daniel Ortega said fighting was raging alongthe border and that there was ``cross fire from Honduran territoryagainst our forces.''   ``This is the hour in which the Nicaraguan people must placethemselves at the orders of the Sandinista army,'' the governmentradio network said late Wednesday.   It said troops were being mobilized throughout the country, anddemonstrators took to the street in the southern town of Rivas,near the Costa Rican border, to protest the dispatching of U.S.troops to Honduras.   The radio called Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo's requestfor U.S. military help ``just a disguise, since these troops couldwell come into Nicaragua. This is certainly the intention, and theywill do it at any moment.''   ``But they will not catch the Nicaraguan people sleeping,'' theradio network said.   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theUnited States was sending 3,200 soldiers to southern Honduras tocarry out training exercises and to be ``a signal to thegovernments and the people of Central America.'' He said they wouldnot enter any combat zones.   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras of Honduras saidWednesday night that Azcona contacted Ortega to demand thewithdrawal of the Sandinista troops. Honduran military intelligencesources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The AssociatedPress that Honduran troops had surrounded about 2,000 Nicaraguansoldiers near the border.   In Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias said his government hadconfirmed the incursion. He condemned it.   The leftist Nicaraguan government took control of all privatelyowned radio stations Wednesday and hooked them up into a nationalnetwork that broadcast government announcements and revolutionarymusic.   Ortega told a news conference Wednesday afternoon that theoffensive was launched March 6 and that Sandinista troops recentlydisloged about 2,000 rebels from northern Jinotega province. He didnot say how many Sandinista troops took part in that action.   Ortega said the Contras were receiving logistical support andevacuation from Chinook helicopters owned by the United States.   Referring to reports earlier Wednesday that the Reaganadministration was considering sending military support toHonduras, Ortega said: ``This is the most serious threat in recentyears. We are calling on the Nicaraguan public to be alert, to bein combat readiness, ready to repel, resist, defeat whateveraggression from the United States.''   State-run Voice of Nicaragua radio said earlier there werereports from the Atlantic coastal city of Puerto Cabezas, 250 mileseast of Managua, that unidentified airplanes were seen and thatresidents feared the city would be bombed.   It called on Nicaraguans to ``maintain a state of alert ...because we can't discount the possibility that President Reaganwill invade Nicaragua in defense of his mercenaries.''   A Defense Ministry spokeswoman, Maj. Rosa Pasos, told reportersearlier: ``We have never invaded Honduras and we have never invadedany neighboring country.''   Lopez Contreras said the Honduran president telephoned thepresidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala to ask them tourge Ortega to withdraw his troops from the border.   Speaking of the offensive against the Contras, Ortega said:``They have been totally expelled from Nicaraguan territory and arelocated in Honduran territory, opening fire against our positionsin Nicaragua.''   The leftist president said that 400 Contras had been killed orwounded in the operation. Thirty-four Sandinista soldiers had diedand 68 were wounded, he said.   Ortega charged that the United States was ``creating thisscandal'' to delay talks between the Sandinistas and Contras on acease-fire in the 6{-year-old war. The meeting _ which would be thefirst on Nicaraguan territory _ is scheduled next Monday.   The president said he called on the United Nations and theOrganization of American States to investigate the offensive and toprove that the Contra bases were located in Honduras.   Honduras and other Central Americans are prohibited fromoffering financial or logistical help to rebels under a regionalpeace plan signed August 7.   In March 1986, 1,500 Sandinista troops reportedly penetratedHonduran territory. U.S. helicopters ferried Honduran troops to theborder and provided Honduras $20 million in emergency aid.   Ortega never directly admitted the incursion but said at thetime: ``We attack where they say they have their bases.''   Until last year, the Contras maintained support bases inHonduras. Fueled by $100 million in U.S. aid, most of the more than6,000 rebels moved their camps into Nicaraguan territory.   In December 1986, Honduran warplanes and artillery poundedSandinista troops who had penetrated into Honduras to attack Contrabases, and U.S. Army helicopters again were brought in to ferryHonduran infantrymen to the front.</TEXT></DOC>
