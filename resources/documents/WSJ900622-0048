A number of business people and politicians have expressedconcern about talk within the ANC of nationalizing segmentsof the South African economy as part of a plan to redressinequities between that country's black and whitepopulations.</LP><TEXT>   In a draft of a breakfast speech Mr. Mandela is scheduledto give to business leaders at the World Trade Center, theSouth African leader says, &quot;We are sensitive to the fact thatas investors in a post-apartheid South Africa, you will needto be confident about the security of your investments, anadequate and equitable return on your capital and a generalclimate of peace and stability.&quot;   All investors, he continues, &quot;should know it as a matterof fact that the investment they make today, whether in thehouse they build, the child they educate or the savings theyput into a bank, is not likely to vanish tomorrow because ofsome arbitrary government action or a social upheavalgenerated by continuing social injustice.&quot;   In the draft speech, Mr. Mandela, deputy ANC president,goes into no detail about the economy of a new South Africa.He does say the economy will be mixed but adds, &quot;we have noblueprint as to the makeup of that mix.&quot;   More specific material on the ANC's vision for SouthAfrica's economy is contained in a document developed byeconomists from the ANC and the Congress of South AfricanTrade Unions. The document says the first responsibility ofthe new government would be to meet basic food, housing andemployment needs, and it asserts this should be done througha policy of promoting economic growth, rather thansupplementing incomes.   Espousing positions not unlike those of the RepublicanParty in the U.S., the ANC paper calls for battlingimpoverished conditions by &quot;creating new production capacitythrough employment linkages rather than in the form of simpleincome supplements.&quot; It also recommends imposing user chargesfor some government services. The proposals were printed in anewspaper edited by a top aide to Mr. Mandela.   The paper calls for a halt to current efforts by the SouthAfrican government to turn some industries over to privateownership and to deregulate others. And it recommends &quot;as amatter of fundamental policy,&quot; that an ANC-led governmentshould be prepared to &quot;renationalize privatized stateassets.&quot; That might refer, for example, to the transportationindustry, which until recently was state-owned but has beenprivatized by the government of President F.W. de Klerk.   In a recent speech to corporate executives inJohannesburg, Mr. Mandela said it is &quot;eminently wrong&quot; forthe government to restructure the economy &quot;precisely at themoment when the whole country and the world expect thatfundamental political change is in the offing. It would seemonly reasonable that so important a question as the disposalof public property should be held over until a trulyrepresentative government is in place.&quot;   In the Johannesburg speech, which was made available byANC officials, Mr. Mandela said it is a mistaken view &quot;thatthe only words in the economic vocabulary that the ANC knowsare nationalization and redistribution.&quot; He said these areamong &quot;many issues&quot; to be considered as South Africansdiscuss &quot;the democratization and deracialization of economicpower.&quot;   Mr. Mandela said a new South African government couldstudy antitrust laws in the U.S. and Great Britain &quot;toaddress the issue of how to ensure that there is no unhealthyoverconcentration of economic power.&quot;   The policy recommendations of the economists from the ANCand the Congress of South African Trade Unions urge &quot;aleading role&quot; for the state &quot;in the reconstruction of theeconomy.&quot; The current state of land distribution is a&quot;central national grievance,&quot; according to the document.   Both the recommendations and the Johannesburg speech saythat corporations in South Africa would have to bear agreater tax burden. &quot;The aim would be to reduce the burden ofdirect and indirect taxation on sections of the communityleast capable of looking after themselves,&quot; Mr. Mandela toldthe South African corporate leaders, &quot;and to shift more ofthe load onto the corporate sector, without, of course,producing a situation of diminishing returns.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
