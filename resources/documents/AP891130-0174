Gorbachev, saying the twohave a ``powerful and historic opportunity'' to work for peace.Gorbachev, in a speech in Rome, called for a 35-nation meeting nextyear to speed the integration of Europe.   Urging an end to East-West divisions, Gorbachev said the changessweeping Eastern Europe and toppling hard-line communist regimesare irrevocable. He said they do not signal ``the collapse ofsocialism'' but, rather, further development of a concept withnoble goals and ``enormous humanistic and democratic potential.''   ``I'm ready and confident,'' Bush said at a farewell ceremony inthe White House Rose Garden a few hours before departing AndrewsAir Force Base, Md., aboard the presidential jet. He labeledhimself and Gorbachev as ``envoys for positive, productive change.''   He praised Gorbachev as a man ``looking for ways to keep thosereforms moving forward, and I'm looking for ways to promotedemocracy and freedom.''   ``And today,'' the president said, ``the people of Berlin toastthe dawn of a new Europe.''   Aboard Air Force One shortly after takeoff, Bush told reporters,``We're about on the same wavelength, from what I've heard from thebriefings'' by European leaders who had recently spoken withGorbachev.   Half a world away, authorities on the Mediterranean island ofMalta were busy mobilizing the military _ and even the boy scouts _in preparation for the superpower leaders.   Not even a shortage of tiny, wavable Soviet flags was enough tohamper the preparations, said Eddie Stafrace, who reported selling160 American and Maltese flags a day from his little toy storebehind the Palace of the Grand Masters in Valletta.   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Saturday, beginning 11{ hours oftalks over two days on warships anchored off the Mediterraneanisland of Malta.   Addressing 300 administration officials, Bush said, ``Thismeeting represents a point of departure, the beginning of a processas full of promise as any that we've ever known.   ``And given the remarkable and rapid change in Eastern Europe,''he said, ``our meeting will be yet another important step in thislong but hopeful journey toward a Europe that is indeed whole andfree.''   The discussions are expected to focus on the reforms in EasternEurope, negotiations to cut nuclear arms and conventional forces,trade issues, and regional disputes, including a U.S. complaintabout Soviet-made weapons shipped to El Salvador.   Bush praised Gorbachev for his ``efforts to relax the grip ofthe centralized government, to move toward pluralism and the freeexpression of ideas.''   Calling the changes in the Soviet Union ``dramatic,'' Bush said,``I believe the people of Europe can see that Mr. Gorbachev and I _East and West _ are not in some kind of competition. Rather, we'reboth working to make the world a more peaceful one.''   Bush, who originally described the summit as an informal,get-acquainted meeting, used the word ``historic'' three times todescribe the weekend talks.   ``Ours is a powerful and historic opportunity, made possible bya continuing American commitment to the (Western) Alliance and itsdefense,'' he said.   As Bush was preparing to leave, Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, and 32 other members of Congress urged him togive priority in his talks to ending the rule that imposes highU.S. tariffs on Soviet imports.   The president has authority to waive the Jackson-VanikAmendment, a provision in the trade law that denies``most-favored-nation'' status to the Soviets because of theirlimits on emigration.   It will be the first superpower summit since Gorbachev metthen-President Ronald Reagan on New York's Governor's Island onDec. 7, 1988. Bush, vice president at the time, sat in on thosetalks.   Since then, a tide of democracy has swept over Europe, removingfrom power authoritarian communist regimes in Poland, Hungary,Czechoslavakia, East Germany and Bulgaria.   Only Romania has spurned the reforms initiated by Gorbachevafter he rose to power in March, 1985.   In the text of an interview released Thursday, Bush proddedRomania to get in step with its Eastern European neighbors. ``MyGod, I'd like to see some action there,'' he said. `` ... I'd liketo see them come into the New World and not deprive their people ofa chance to be independent and free.''   Looking ahead to the summit, Bush said, ``Mr. Gorbachev and Isee eye to eye on what our upcoming meeting is all about. We bothwant to build a sustained relationship for real achievements overthe long term.''   Bush and Gorbachev have expressed support for the changes andsaid they want them to be carried out peacefully.   In the Rome speech following his talks with Italian governmentleaders, the Soviet president said the 35-nation meeting he called``Helsinki 2'' should be moved up from 1992, as originally calledfor under the 1975 Helsinki Accords on human rights and security inEurope.   He made the proposal in a speech from the Campidoglio, Rome'scity hall, where the treaty was signed in 1957 establishing theEuropean Common Market.   On the eve of his historic meeting with Pope John Paul II, hesaid that Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion andnow believe religious values can help in the restructuring ofSoviet society.   Aboard Air Force One, Bush was asked by reporters aboutGorbachev's proposal. The president replied: ``I'll talk to him.Any ideas he's got, I'll discuss them with him. Then we'll let youknow.''   Earlier in the day, Italy and the Soviet Union declared that the``curtain of mistrust between the East and the Wet is crumbling,''and they promised to support the dramatic movement in EasternEurope for deocratic reform.   In a joint statement, issued at the conclusion of two days ofhigh-level talks, the countries cited the ``changes towarddemocracy'' taking place in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgariaand Czechoslovakia.   Gorbachev indicated that the movement toward uniting Europecould be accelerated, with the participation of the United Statesand Canada.   ``In the final analysis,'' he said, ``we envision Europe as acommonwealth of sovereign democratic states with a high level ofequitable interdependence and easily accessible borders open to theexchange of products, technologies and ideas and wide-rangingcontacts among people.''   Bush was to arrive in Malta at mid-morning Friday after anall-night, nine-hour flight from Washington. He planned to fly outto the American aircraft carrier, the USS Forrestal, to meet withcrew members and officers and to deliver a speech.   Bush and Gorbachev will meet on two guided-missile cruisers. OnSaturday they will hold talks on the Soviet ship, the Slava, and inthe evening will have a dinner on the U.S. ship, the Belknap, theflagship of the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean.   The second and final day of talks will be on the Belknap. Thetwo leaders are to make a joint appearance and make statements onthe Belknap and then hold separate news conferences before leavingMalta on Sunday night.   Bush will fly to Brussels to brief NATO leaders on the talks.The Soviet news agency Tass said Gorbachev will meet with otherleaders of Warsaw Pact nations in Moscow sometime in early December.   Completing his summit preparations in Washington, Bush placedtelephone calls to Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti andFrench President Francois Mitterrand. The White House said Bush hadcalled leaders of all the NATO countries in recent days.</TEXT></DOC>
