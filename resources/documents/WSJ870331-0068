But they are finding the effort both costly and difficult.    Led by Time Inc.'s Home Box Office and Viacom International Inc.'s Showtime/The Movie Channel, pay networks grew rapidly from 1978 to 1984 as the whole cable market mushroomed. But in early 1985, as movies became available on videocassette months earlier than on pay networks, thousands of subscribers began dropping out each month.    At the same time, HBO and other pay networks found it harder to lure new customers. In the first four months of 1986, the number of subscribers to the major pay networks fell by 330,000, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., media investment concern.    But largely because of a direct-mail marketing campaign by HBO and aggressive marketing by Walt Disney Co.'s Disney Channel, business picked up later in 1986. For the year, subscriptions to the big pay networks rose 4.2% to 31.2 million.    Subscription growth is continuing this year, says Steven Rosenberg, an analyst at Kagan -- at a cost. Referring to the pay networks' promotional spending and price cutting, Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said in a recent report, &quot;One has to wonder if the networks are just giving it away.&quot; He says that while subscriptions may continue to rise in 1987, cost pressures and price cutting make it all but certain that revenue per subscriber will slip this year.    Cable operators are willing participants in the price-cutting programs. For one thing, because of deregulation, which took effect Jan. 1, the operators have been allowed to raise rates for basic cable service. In addition, the pay networks are cutting the prices they charge operators.    For many consumers, the result is lower rates for pay TV services. For example, Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company, ran a special Christmas promotion offering new subscribers any of the half-dozen pay networks for up to a year at just $2 a month -- compared with the usual monthly fee of $10 to $13. Systems that offer HBO have been throwing in its sister service, Cinemax, for a nominal extra charge. And The Disney Channel halved its retail prices in an agreement with cable operators last year, helping to boost the network's subscribers 27.8% to 3.2 million.    The pay networks also are getting a boost by entering other markets, including backyard satellite dish owners and so-called pay-per-view services that enable subscribers to buy a single movie or special sports event. New services may also boost subscribers. HBO will launch a network called Festival in June aimed at families and older viewers who don't want any controversial programs or R-rated movies.    Industry executives and analysts are also encouraged by evidence of a shift in consumer attitudes toward videocassette recorders. According to industry executives, consumers who have owned VCRs for two or more years appear to rent fewer movies than when they first bought the machine. Moreover, Mr. Leibowitz and many others in the industry believe that consumers increasingly view pay cable as a way to get a lot of programming at relatively low rates, rather than as a way to see the best movies right away.    The pay networks' latest bid for subscribers also includes changes in programming. HBO and Showtime, seeking to differentiate their offerings, have signed exclusive movie contracts with rival studios; in past years, both frequently offered the same films. In addition, each is adding made-for-TV movies, series, and exclusive events, like boxing matches on HBO.    The Disney Channel, meanwhile, is trying to attract a broader family audience. The network, originally aimed at children, now is developing prime-time situation comedies. It is also making TV movies &quot;that adults can watch but children don't have to leave the room for,&quot; says John Cooke, the Disney Channel's president.    HBO, by far the largest of the services, with 19.1 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks, had a difficult 1986. Operating profit at Time's programming operations -- primarily HBO -- dropped 8.3% to $111 million as sales rose 13% to $886 million. HBO spent over $30 million last year on marketing to boost subscriptions. The outlays included a direct-mail campaign last fall that reached about 70% of U.S. households with television, even though cable is only available in 49%.    Michael Fuchs, HBO chief executive, says it's too early to tell how many people who signed up for HBO or Cinemax during the promotions will stay with the services. But due to the aggressive marketing, &quot;we're doing much better than we expected,&quot; Mr. Fuchs says. In the first half of 1986, subscriptions at both of HBO's services were relatively flat, but for the year as a whole, they climbed 2.7% at Home Box Office and 10.8% at Cinemax.    For second-ranked Showtime, the going is tougher. Subscriptions in 1986 rose only 50,000 at Showtime and fell 200,000 at its sister service, The Movie Channel. The two services now have a total of 8.1 million subscribers. Viacom doesn't disclose their results, but in 1986, according to company financial documents, their revenue fell 1% and operating profit plunged 66%.    While Showtime's subscriptions are languishing, its costs are escalating. Over the past two years, Showtime has agreed to spend about $640 million on exclusive movie rights from such studios as Paramount Pictures Corp., the Gulf andamp; Western Inc. unit that was No. 1 at the box office last year with such hits as &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV.&quot;    Showtime's strategy isn't to steal HBO subscribers, says Jules Haimovitz, head of the Viacom unit that oversees the pay service. Rather, he says, the company is aiming to persuade potential subscribers that if they don't buy both networks, they'll only see half of Hollywood's best movies.    Analysts say the Disney Channel may have the best growth prospects. The network is available to about 30 million homes that don't buy it. During 1986, &quot;we made a major effort to convince cable operators that the Disney Channel was overpriced and mispackaged,&quot; says Mr. Cooke, the network's president. For example, cable subscribers often had to buy an expensive package that included two other pay networks to get the Disney Channel.    Now, the network is available &quot;a la carte&quot; in many cable systems, Mr. Cooke says. &quot;Everything we see leads us to believe we're going to continue to have significant growth.&quot;    In addition to the major pay networks, a handful of regional and specialized networks are showing signs of improvement. American Movie Classics, an old-movie service available in certain cable networks, has slashed prices and could triple its two million subscribers this year, Mr. Leibowitz says.    One specialty network that continues to struggle is Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s Playboy Channel, where subscriptions fell 11.6% last year. Many cable systems don't carry it because of the sensitive nature of its programming, and Kagan's Mr. Rosenberg says Playboy faces &quot;the biggest obstacles of any major pay service.&quot;    ---                        Subscribing to TV      Pay cable networks show some gains in subscribers                  (As of Dec. 31, in millions)                                1986                1985    HBO                         15.0                14.6    Showtime                     5.4                 5.3    Cinemax                      4.1                 3.7    MovieChannel                 2.9                 3.1    Disney Channel               3.2                 2.5    Playboy Channel              0.61                0.69    Source: Paul Kagan Associates</TEXT></DOC>
