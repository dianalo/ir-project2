The dollar, which rose significantly earlier in the day, was down against most major currencies in late New York trading. Many traders said market sentiment remains generally bullish toward the dollar, mainly because of the continuing threat of a widened war in the Persian Gulf region. That threat has spurred the dollar sharply higher in the past few weeks as investors seek the perceived safety of the U.S. currency.    &quot;The 'safe haven' notion is strongly in the market, and everything else is built on top of that,&quot; said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8924 West German marks, off slightly from 1.8933 Friday, but down substantially from a high of 1.8978 yesterday morning. The intraday high was struck after reports that a Panamanian tanker hit a mine in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz.    News of the incident sparked brisk dollar buying because traders saw an increased chance for U.S. retaliation against Iran, which is suspected of seeding the region's waters with explosives. Traders expect heavy buying pressure on the dollar in the event of any direct conflict between U.S. and Iranian forces, which would threaten oil supplies from the region and the economies of Japan and Europe that are dependent upon those supplies.    The dollar is also considered by international investors as a safe currency for parking funds during periods of world crises.    To some extent, many market participants have a major stake wagered on heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf. &quot;If it all just dies away and nothing happens, then I can anticipate a correction,&quot; or decline, in the dollar, Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at BankAmerica International, New York, said.    Traders said the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank intervened selling dollars for the fifth consecutive session yesterday. The Bundesbank sold $10.7 million to buy marks at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, and was estimated to have sold about $100 million in the open market there. A Fed spokesman, citing policy, declined to confirm or deny any activity. In Zurich, the Swiss National Bank denied a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal that it intervened in the dollar market last week.    Some traders said that even without yesterday's intervention, the dollar probably would have declined yesterday. &quot;As we get to 1.90 (marks) there's going to be a natural tendency toward profit taking,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager, European American Bank, New York.    The Middle East situation and concerted central bank intervention has churned up a usually dull August foreign exchange market. &quot;Whoever was playing computer golf is back to the market. The computer golf games have been shelved,&quot; Merrill Lynch's Mr. Mondschein said.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 150.95 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $5.80 an ounce to $460.40 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $461.65 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                 Monday, Aug. 10, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
