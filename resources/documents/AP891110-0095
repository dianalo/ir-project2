They included 9,300 Communist Party members and one viceminister, and three people who embezzled more than $270,000, saiddeputy chief prosecutor Zhang Siqing.   The People's Supreme Court and prosecutor's office announcedAug. 15 that all who turned themselves in before Oct. 31 foreconomic crimes would be treated leniently.   Those who confessed admitted receiving bribes and embezzling $94million, and returned the equivalent of $56 million in ``ill-gottengains,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhang as saying.   Since the call went out in August, 17,600 government employeesconfessed to receiving bribes and other actions ``in violation ofdiscipline,'' Xinhua said.   Shanghai newspapers reported last week that factory bosses,managers and midlevel business officials were among those whosurrendered during the campaign.
