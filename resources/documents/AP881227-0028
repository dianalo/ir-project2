Barry has acknowledged meeting the man, former city employeeCharles Lewis, three times last week at a hotel where a hotel maidcomplained that Lewis offered her cocaine.   In an investigation that has since turned into a probe of howpolice handled a case touching on the mayor, two undercover officerswere reportedly called back from their attempt to buy drugs at thetime Barry was in the room with Lewis, according to The WashingtonPost.   The Post also reported the city police official in charge of theoriginal case offered to lie to reporters about the Lewisinvestigation, a charge the official denied.   ``That statement is emphatically a lie,'' Deputy Chief Edward J.Spurlock, said on WUSA-TV Monday. ``I would not lie in reference tothe performance of my duty.''   The Washington Post reported Monday that Barry was in a cityhotel room with Lewis on Thursday when two detectives were calledback from an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis.   The Post, quoting unidentified city government sources, said thedetectives were on their way to the room but left after ``somebodycalled them back downstairs.''   The Post reported in today's editions that the two detectivesgave conflicted accounts of the incident at the hotel, but said nodetails were available on how the accounts differed.   Lewis, a Virgin Islands resident, has denied any involvement withdrugs.   Traces of cocaine were found in the hotel room after Lewischecked out last Friday, although the tests did not indicate whetherthe cocaine had been in the room recently.   District of Columbia police are now investigating whether Lewiswas involved with drugs, how police handled the complaint and whythe mayor was at the hotel.   Barry has telephoned police officials involved in the internalinvestigation several times, even though he is expected to bequestioned, the Post reported, quoting sources.   A mayoral spokesman has denied Barry was trying to influence theinvestigation and said the calls were made only to find out when itwould be completed. He quoted Barry as saying, ``I want them tofinish this investigation and get to the bottom of this as soon aspossible.''</TEXT></DOC>
