Most residents know of someone who has AIDS. The health caresystem is saturated, local officials are pleading for federal fundsand the gay community has rallied as never before.   San Francisco has the nation's highest per-capita incidence ofAIDS. Authorities expect that by the end of the year more than24,000 residents will have been infected with the virus. Of 7,416people reported with full-blown AIDS, 4,827 have died.   Eight years after AIDS began to cut its deadly swath across SanFrancisco, changes are apparent.   Instead of organizing to get government ``off our backs and outof our bedrooms,'' gay activists have launched a powerful movementto make government work for them.   ``We realized that government did have a role to play in ourlives,'' said Ron Braithwaite, president of the Alice B. ToklasLesbian and Gay Democratic Club.   As gay men and lesbians work together on AIDS, they are forgingan alliance some believe will exert unprecedented influence.   ``It has made us politically stronger, wiser and betterorganized than we have ever been,'' said Jean Harris, an aide toBoard of Supervisors President Harry Britt and chairwoman of theGay and Lesbian Caucus of the California Democratic Party.   The city has become an international model for low-cost,patient-oriented AIDS care that relies on an enormous base ofvolunteers, but the cost of the epidemic is daunting.   Total AIDS spending this year is estimated at $115 million,according to mayoral aide Susan Ehrlich. Most of the $80 millionfrom the private sector will come from private health insurers, thecity will add $7.6 million, and state and federal government willprovide the rest, she said.   And officials expect an additional $30 million will be neededwhen the city formally endorses early care programs for peoplewithout symptoms.   The city's AIDS Office has 75 employees and a budget this yearof $25 million, including state and federal funds, to coordinatemore than 200 different AIDS organizations and service providers.When it was established in 1983, the office had one director, asecretary and $150,000.   At San Francisco General Hospital, AIDS care will cost between$15 million and $20 million this year, executive director Phil Sowasaid. The 20 beds designated for AIDS patients are always full and20 overflow patients are hospitalized in different wards, he said.   A crisis looms in the city's inability to provide sufficientpost-hospital care at skilled nursing facilities and board-and-carehomes, he said.   Many speak of the ``talent drain'' as the city loses so manypeople in their prime. The impact can be devastating.   ``Who would've thought I'd be reading the obits at 40? Everyday,'' said Scott Smith, former lover and business partner ofHarvey Milk, the city's first openly gay supervisor, who was slainin 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone.   Smith said he can't bear to replace his outdated address book``and leave out all the names that wouldn't move into the new one.''   AIDS also has politicized a new generation of activists whoscrutinize anything having to do with the disease.   Organizations like Stop AIDS Now Or Else have stagedcontroversial protests like blockading the Golden Gate Bridge anddisrupting the glittery opening night of the opera season to callattention to demands for faster action on drug testing andincreased financing for AIDS care and research.   ``I think AIDS is one of the new exciting things to be radicalabout,'' said Eric Rofes, executive director of the Shanti Project,a volunteer-based AIDS agency that serves 1,200 a month.   In the gay community, AIDS prevention and education remain a toppriority.   Some credit AIDS with triggering a trend toward long-term,committed relationships between gay men, while others say thehealth crisis simply speeded up a process that began before AIDS.   ``I believe that without AIDS, the picture would look verysimilar in terms of more coupling and more (adopted) children,''said Rofes.   Public health experts worry that their greatest challenge in thegay community now is keeping the ``safe sex'' message alive.   Researchers have noted a slight increase in the number of gaymen who are engaging in unsafe sex again, despite the high risk.About half of the gay men in the city are believed to be infectedwith HIV.   Having saturated their own community with preventioninformation, gays are forming alliances with other high-riskgroups, including intravenous drug users.   Fighting AIDS also has united gay men and lesbians.   Although some doubt the durability of the alliance, Harrispoints to Britt's domestic partnership legislation as a byproductof the AIDS epidemic and a signal of future struggles.   The proposal, which was narrowly defeated by city voters inNovember, would have recognized unions between unmarried live-inlovers who register with the city, and would have extendedvisitation and bereavement-leave rights to city workers.   The proposal had strong backing from gays in the age of AIDS whohad been denied hospital access to their dying lovers or wereturned down when requesting time off to attend funerals, Harrissaid.   Large corporations have developed AIDS education programs andprovide referrals for employees seeking counseling or otherservices.   But many small businesses cannot get affordable health coverage,according to Scott Hauge, president of the Small Business Networkof San Francisco, who said one company with 200 workers facedacross-the-board rate increases of 125 percent after two employeescame down with AIDS.   ``We've demonstrated that the health care system in this countryis very fragile and a lot of people are slipping through it,'' saidBraithwaite of the Toklas club.   Signs of the AIDS epidemic are everywhere _ even in the chirp ofpersonal electronic timers frequently heard in restaurants andmovie theaters in predominantly gay neighborhoods.
