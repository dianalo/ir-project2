The Democratic-controlled panel concludes in its annual reviewthat the nation will struggle with ``the legacy of experiment'' insupply-side economics, large spending increases for the militaryand an ever-growing debt.   The report credits last fall's federal deficit-reductionagreement between President Reagan and congressional leaders as amajor step toward controlling the record red ink, which willapproach $3 trillion by the end of the decade.   That amount is more than three times what it was when Reagantook office.   The report calls the agreement ``only a first step,'' notingthat current deficit projections assume a stable economy. ``Shoulda recession occur, the federal budget situation would deterioraterapidly, risking a serious disruption in financial markets.''   The report hesitates to predict when a recession will occur.   ``Given the mixed signals of 1987, it is hardly surprising thatthere is considerable uncertainty among the professionalforecasters about the course of the economy in 1988,'' it said.   Despite last year's stock market collapse, consumer spending hasremained strong. Business and housing investment has been mixed.   ``Previous forecasts of a significant drop in our net importshave not been borne out, however, as the competitive effects of thedeclining value of the dollar have been slow to be realized,'' itsaid.   At the same time, ``some forecasters are now beginning to raisequestions about possible inflationary overheating of the economy,''it said.   The next president will have to find a new set of economicpolicies while adjusting to a greater international influence overthe nation's economy due in part to the large foreign debt. Duringthe 1980s, the United States has gone from the world's largestcreditor to its largest debtor.   The report's recommendations include diligent attention to thedomestic and foreign trade deficits along with prudent investmentin education and job training.   ``These critical deficits were built up over a number ofyears,'' it said. ``They will not be rectified quickly.''   The Republicans on the committee, dissenting from the Democrats,cite in their section of the report the extended strength of thecurrent economic expansion, now in its sixth year.   ``The foundation of any economy is a people at productivework,'' they said. ``Never has the foundation of our economy beenstronger.''</TEXT></DOC>
