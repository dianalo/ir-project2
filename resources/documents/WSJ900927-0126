Cohen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)SECURITIES (SCR)BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   NEW YORK -- The government, as expected, urged a federaljudge to sentence Michael Milken to a &quot;substantial&quot; prisonterm for six securities-related crimes to which he pleadedguilty in April.   The government specifically urged that Mr. Milken get morethan the three-year sentence received by Ivan F. Boesky, theconvicted former stock speculator who cooperated with thegovernment's investigation of insider trading and othersecurities crimes.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, lawyers for Mr. Milken acknowledged that heengaged in a dozen additional transactions -- to which he didnot plead guilty -- that furthered an illegal conspiracy withMr. Boesky.   The admission came in response to an order from U.S.District Judge Kimba Wood that the attorneys provideadditional information about Mr. Milken's activities with Mr.Boesky. Mr. Milken, the former junk-bond chief at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., is scheduled to be sentenced by JudgeWood on Monday.   In a sentencing memo made public on Tuesday, Mr. Milken'slawyers urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milken to communityservice, saying he was a decent and charitable man who wasremorseful about any wrongs he had committed.   In contrast, the government's memo depicted Mr. Milken asa man who systematically used his firm's junk-bonddepartment, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., to pursue hisillegal activity. According to the memo, the departmentbecame &quot;the means through which Milken rewarded his friends,defeated his rivals and committed his crimes.&quot; Mr. Milken'sobjectives, the government said, &quot;were simple: power andwealth.&quot;   Although Mr. Milken's lawyers have said that he intends tocooperate with the government after he is sentenced, thegovernment indicated that it has doubts about Mr. Milken'swillingness to do so.   &quot;Our confidence in Milken's intention to be truthful andforthcoming has waned,&quot; the memo stated, because &quot;nothingabout Milken's conduct to date suggests the contrition orremorse that often predicts sincere cooperation by adefendant.&quot;   One of the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty lastApril involved a conspiracy to commit illegal trades with Mr.Boesky that included transactions other than those to whichMr. Milken pleaded guilty. But Mr. Milken never said what theother trades were, and Judge Wood said on Monday that toissue an appropriate sentence she needed to know more aboutthem.   In response, Arthur Liman, the lead attorney for Mr.Milken, wrote a letter to the judge listing additionaltransactions.   When he entered his plea last April, Mr. Milken said heforced an unwilling Fischbach Corp. into the hands ofcorporate raider Victor Posner by having Mr. Boesky take alarge and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.Mr. Milken also said he helped Mr. Boesky evade net-capitalrules and used Mr. Boesky to artificially support the priceof MCA Inc. common stock while Golden Nugget Inc., a Drexelclient, was selling its MCA shares.   In the letter to Judge Wood, Mr. Liman said that Mr.Milken had further assisted Mr. Boesky in evading net-capitalrequirements by secretly agreeing to buy AmericanBroadcasting Cos. and Enserch Corp. securities from him inearly 1985, with the understanding that the securities wouldbe bought back later at no loss to Drexel.   Mr. Liman also detailed securities trades in eightdifferent companies that were intended to enable Boesky torecoup losses he had suffered on other illegal trades withMr. Milken. These compensatory trades, which occurred in1985, involved securities of Leasco, First Texas, ValeroEnergy Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Wickes Cos., RepublicAirlines, MSA Realty Corp. and MSA Shopping Corp.   Mr. Liman also said that Mr. Milken had encouraged Mr.Boesky to invest in securities of Diamond Shamrock Corp. andHarris Graphics Corp., with the understanding that Drexelwould share in any of the profits Mr. Boesky derived.</TEXT></DOC>
