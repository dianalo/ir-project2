(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brilando, Joseph; Johnson, Garry; Rob, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>SILENCE IS GOLDENandM;To the Editor:andM;In the April 23 article &quot;Borland Revives with Fat Year,&quot; you published aquote about Ashton-Tate's internal company goals.andP;  I stated at the beginningof my interview that Ashton-Tate does not make forecasts of future earnings.andO;We disclaim any indication about what our company will earn this quarter orin any future period.andM;Joseph Brilando, Vice PresidentandM;Corporate Marketing and StrategyandM;Ashton-TateandM;Torrance, Calif.andM;A TAXING SOLUTIONandM;To the Editor:andM;It was with interest that I read your March 26 editorial.andP;  It's obvious thatyou see some of the problems; it's even more obvious that you approachsolutions from a narrow-minded and provincial position.andM;Your solution is to &quot;encourage investment in high-tech companies by cuttingthe rate at which profits earned there are taxed&quot; and to &quot;lower cost ofcapital by restricting tax deductibility on interest payments.&quot;andM;The 1986 tax-reform package has done the latter already.andP;  Only one type ofinterest payment is still tax-deductible for the middle and working classes:the home-mortgage interest deduction.andP;  Your suggestion then is just adishonest call for its revocation, which would greatly increase the alreadylarge tax bill of the average person while cutting taxes for large businessinterests, foreigners and wealthy individuals.andM;The perspective of the wealthy ruling classes, with more &quot;soak the poor&quot; taxschemes, ignores other factors like the lack of an intelligent, flexible andrealistic national industrial policy.andM;Garry JohnsonandM;Lenoir City, Tenn.andM;ATTITUDE CHECKandM;To the Editor:andM;Jim Seymour's April Fool's Day column was a barrel of yucks!andP;  Could I reallyconclude that Jim Seymour doesn't like IBM?andP;  Do any of your columnists haveanything good to say about IBM?andP;  Or is a dislike for IBM part of the jobdescription?andM;I grew up with the TRS-80 and the world of CP/M, transferred my allegiance toApple and AppleSoft, and became a DOS devotee in 1981 when IBM produced thePC.andP;  Since then, I've owned several clones.andP;  I, too, was fashionablyanti-Blue for quite a few years.andP;  But we all have to grow up sometime, and Idiscovered that IBM is a fine company that sells products that generally workvery well.andM;When you've stopped laughing at my &quot;discovery,&quot; consider these questions:andM;-- If IBM had not entered the PC market in 1981, would any of you beemployed?andP;  IBM made microcomputing respectable and created a new computingworld.andM;-- If IBM is wrong (almost) every time, how come IBM is bigger than PC Week?andM;-- If IBM is really big, does that mean there are a lot of stupid customers?andM;-- So what if IBM's micros aren't the fastest on the block.andP;  They work justfine.andM;-- Our clones have a solid record of maintenance problems.andP;  Our IBM machineshave never required maintenance.andM;-- Do you see a possible conflict of interest?andP;  If I (or any of yourcolumnists) install clones, we get big bucks for our sage advice.andP;  The shopsthat install IBM equipment get turnkey operations whose costs are included inthe price of the equipment.andP;  Worse, IBM generally supplies a telephone numberthat makes us sage advice-givers unnecessary.andM;Admit it just once: Sometimes IBM is OK.andP;  IBM produces solid equipment,provides solid support and employs first-rate people.andP;  Yes, you pay for allthat support and quality.andP;  But that's why a Cadillac costs more than aChevette.andM;Peter RobandM;Murfreesboro, Tenn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
