On other futures markets, grains rallied, but gold, energyproducts and orange juice contracts all declined.   At the Chicago Merc, the frozen pork bellies contract fordelivery in March rose the daily limit of 2 cents after fourcontracts posted the maximum increases allowed in the previoussession.   ``The market is reflecting an insufficent supply of hogs tosatisfy packer needs,'' said Chuck Levitt, an analyst for ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. ``Packers simply don't have the hogs they need,and the consumer and investor are paying more.''   The advance in cattle prices ``was mainly a spillover from thestrong pork complex,'' he said.   Cattle settled .30 cent to .70 cent higher, with the contractfor delivery in April at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were.25 cent to .85 cent higher, with March at 81.87 cents a pound;live hogs were .05 cent to .65 cent higher, with April at 52.07cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .37 cent to 2.00 centshigher, with March at 50.95 cents a pound.   Frozen orange juice futures fell on the New York Cotton Exchangein one of the few down days since the December freeze in Florida.   Shearson's Judy Ganes blamed the drop on profit-taking.   She also said that a Florida growers' report, originally thoughtby traders to be 3 million boxes shy of the U.S. AgricultureDepartment estimate last month, left some traders Wednesday withthe wrong impression.   The growers' figure didn't include 3 million navel oranges andgift fruit, but matched the USDA's estimate in other areas, sheexplained.   Frozen concentrate orange juice settled .10 cent to 1.00 centlower, with the contract for delivery in March at $1.90 a pound.   Soybean and grain futures finished higher after opening slightlylower on the Chicago Board of Trade.   Purchases by Iraqi investors in the soymeal cash market andrumors of Chinese interest in soyoil helped push soybean priceshigher, said analyst Mark Weidner of Cargill Investor Services Inc.   Wheat staged a late rally on news of China's bid for 400,000metric tons of U.S. export bonus wheat, and corn followed suit,traders said.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3{ cents higher, with the contract forMarch at $3.83{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents higher, withMarch at $2.42} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher,with March at $1.45} a bushel; and soybeans were 4 cents to 7 centshigher, with March at $5.81{ a bushel.   Oil prices sagged for a third straight session on the New YorkMercantile Exchange.   Randall Rothenberg, an energy market analyst from Dean WitterReynolds Inc., said selling momentum overseas carried over intoU.S. trading.   Crude oil settled 11 cents to 18 cents lower, with the contractfor delivery in April at $20.78 a barrel; heating oil was .01 centto .85 cent lower, with April at 55.34 cents a gallon; and unleadedgasoline was .25 cent to .88 cent lower, with April at 56.14 centsa gallon.   A stronger U.S. dollar sent gold and silver futures lower on theCommodity Exchange in New York.   Gold settled 20 cents to 50 cents lower, with the contract fordelivery in March at $400 a troy ounce; while silver was 1 cent to1.2 cents lower, with March at $5.11.</TEXT></DOC>
