In calendar 1987, an estimated 903,000 jobs were generated byU.S. agricutural exports valued at $28.6 billion. More than a thirdof the nation's harvested cropland was used to produce for foreignbuyers.   William Edmondson of the department's Economic Research Servicesaid farmers and their workers accounted for about 380,000 of thejobs linked to exports. The other 523,000 were outside the farmsector but were directly or indirectly related to the processing anddistribution of farm exports.   Edmondson, whose analysis was prepared for the March issue ofFarmline magazine, said the total business activity created by farmexports far exceeds the actual sales.   By his reckoning, each dollar received from agricultural exportsin 1987 stimulated another $1.65 of output in the U.S. economy.   ``For example,'' the report said, ``farmers buy machinery andchemicals to produce exported crops. Cattle producers buy feed toproduce exported animal products. And farm products need to beprocessed, packaged and transported to their destinations.''   As a result, the nearly $29 billion in agricultural exports in1987 was said to fuel an additional $47.2 billion in supportingactivities.   ``This additional economic activity included $7.2 billion in thefarm sector, $3.7 billion in the food processing sector, $15.2billion in other manufacturing sectors, $5.8 billion in trade andtransportation, and $15.3 billion in other services,'' the reportsaid.   Farm exports have long been regarded as a major force in the U.S.economy, ranging far beyond the fields and granaries of farmersthemselves. In the early 1980s, when exports were considerablylarger, the impact was even greater.   ``In the peak year of 1981, when $43.3 billion worth of exportswere sold, export-related employment was estimated at 1.2 million,about a third higher than the 1987 figure,'' the report said. ``U.S.farm exports fell by about a third between 1981 and 1986.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department says the U.S. wheatstockpile will be whittled down this spring to one of the smallestinventories since the end of World War II.   By June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year, theinventory may be about 534 million bushels, the smallest since themid-1970s, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday.That would be less than half of the June 1, 1988, carryover of 1.26billion bushels.   Measured against total use, the June 1 wheat reserve of 534million bushels would be about 21 percent of the 2.56 billionbushels consumed domestically and exported in 1988-89, the loweststocks-to-use ratio since the 17 percent of 1973-74.   ``Prior to that, the last time the stocks-to-use ratio was below20 percent was at the end of World War II,'' the report said.   The average farm price of wheat in the 1988-89 marketing year isforecast to range from $3.65 to $3.80 per bushel, more than $1 abovelast season.   In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union bought huge amounts of U.S.wheat, which helped drain off the stockpile. By the end of the1973-74 marketing year, the wheat reserve was down to 340.1 millionbushels, compared with total needs that year of 1.97 billion bushels.   Drought cut into the 1988 wheat harvest, and there has been briskexport demand the past couple of years.   Plantings of winter wheat last fall for the 1989 harvest were upsharply, but the crop has been hurt by dry conditions in large areasof the Great Plains.   ``The increase is attributed to higher wheat prices and thelowering of (federal program) acreage reduction requirements from27.5 percent to 10 percent,'' the report said.   Winter wheat accounts for about three-fourths of total U.S. wheatproduction, with the remainder coming from spring-planted crops. Thereport said, ``Plantings of the 1989 spring wheat and durum crops incoming months are also expected to be up sharply.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Production of farm-grown catfish in January wasan estimated 26.9 million pounds, up 4 percent from a year ago,according to a monthly report by the Agriculture Department.   Prices paid to growers averaged 78 cents per pound, up 10 centsfrom January 1988, the department's Agricultural Statistics Boardsaid Tuesday. The January price received by processors for dressed,whole fish averaged $1.61 per pound for ice pack and $1.72 forfrozen fish.   Imports of freshwater catfish during December, the most recentmonth listed, totaled 182,000 pounds, down sharply from 464,000pounds a year earlier, the report said. Seventy-seven percent of theimports were from Brazil.</TEXT></DOC>
