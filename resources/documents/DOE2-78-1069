This paper summarizes the DOOM (Data Oriented ObjectManager) persistent objects prototype. DOOM is an experiment in languagelevel persistence for object-oriented programmers. Sharing between userson a local area network without increasing the cost of using nonpersistentobjects was an important design objective. The experiment also startedwith emphasis on transparency at the language level, but, as experiencewith integrating the language and the database progressed, more characteristicsof the database were made visible to the applications programmer. DOOMis implemented as language changes and a relational storage manager runningon the UNIX file system. Within the HP Common Lisp Development Environment,DOOM provides applications programmers with persistent sharable objects,to which access can be coordinated in a manner similar to that providedby a database.</TEXT></DOC>
