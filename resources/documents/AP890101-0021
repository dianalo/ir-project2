(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The judge in the PTL bankruptcy casecalled for stricter scrutiny of religious groups in newspaperinterviews in which he described former PTL leader Jim Bakker as a``little, sawed-off runt.''   Rufus Reynolds, who retired Saturday as a U.S. bankruptcy judge,told the Greensboro News andamp; Record that television ministries are``wide open'' for mismanagement or corruption. He also said hereceived death threats while he was handling the case.   ``I think Congress should pass a very strong act forcing the IRS(Internal Revenue Service) ... to make them comply with anaccounting,'' Reynolds said. ``We have all kinds of laws protectingconsumers. Religion is just another consumer item, just the same asselling soap or washing powders or aspirin.''   In a separate interview with The Charlotte Observer, the81-year-old Reynolds said he was amazed at the response to thetravails that brought down Bakker's evangelistic empire.   ``What puzzled me was why people were interested in that little,sawed-off runt,'' Reynolds said.   The PTL founder Sunday criticized the judge's comments.   ``I am shocked to find Judge Reynolds so prejudiced toward us,and to hear of him making fun of us and the PTL partners,'' Bakkersaid in a statement released by one of his attorneys. ``He shouldnot have tried the PTL case with these feelings against us.''   The interviews were published Sunday, the day after Reynolds'tenure in the bankruptcy case ended with his retirement.   The ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy lawsin June 1987, three months after Bakker resigned from PTL amid asex-and-money scandal.   Two months ago, Reynolds ordered Bakker, his wife, Tammy, andformer aide David Taggart to repay PTL nearly $7.7 million inbenefits he found to be excessive. Last month, he approved the saleof PTL assets to a Canadian businessman.   It was also last month that a federal grand jury indicted Bakkerand former top aide Richard Dortch on criminal fraud and conspiracycharges, accusing them of diverting more than $4 million in PTLmoney for their own benefit. Bakker is scheduled to appear in U.S.District Court in Charlotte on Jan. 17.   Upon his retirement, Reynolds told the Observer that he left thePTL case discouraged and somewhat cynical.   For the first time as a bankruptcy judge, Reynolds was guarded byU.S. marshals. He said the FBI investigated death threats.   ``I didn't know Christians could be so critical. They would justchew me out,'' Reynolds said.   When a woman called the bankruptcy court in Columbia to find outif he was a Christian, ``I said, `You tell her I was when I startedthis case, but now I plead the Fifth Amendment.'''   In talking with the News andamp; Record, Reynolds said he would like tosee closer government regulation of all not-for-profit corporations,including churches.   ``They're handling (money) the way they damn please. They mold areligion to fit their pocketbook,'' Reynolds said.   He dismissed arguments that stricter regulation of broadcastministries might violate First Amendment guarantees of freedom ofspeech and worship.   ``The First Amendment has no relation to accounting for money,''Reynolds said. ``When you go stealing other people's money, youcan't say, `The Bible excuses me. I've been forgiven by the Lord.'That doesn't apply.''</TEXT></DOC>
