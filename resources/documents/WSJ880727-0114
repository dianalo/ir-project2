Roger G. Baxter was ordered to pay $135,000 and disgorge $980,000. He was a registered representative in Richmond, Va., with Integrated Resources Equity Corp., a broker-dealer unit of New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. He was barred from future association with any NASD member in any capacity.    The self-regulatory organization said Mr. Baxter obtained $980,000 from customers, maintaining it would be invested in securities with a &quot;high degree of safety.&quot; The broker deposited the money in his own checking account and used the funds for personal expenses and to purchase options, futures and other securities under his own name, NASD said. Mr. Baxter couldn't be reached for comment.    Tanya Brown Hargraves, a registered representative in Memphis, Tenn., was fined $10,000 and barred from future association with any NASD member in any capacity. Ms. Hargraves exceeded trading limitations placed on her as head trader of Municipal Securities Inc., Memphis, and tried to conceal the activity, according to the NASD. Losses at Municipal Securities were about $957,000 and resulted in the dissolution of that concern's government securities affiliate. Ms. Hargrave couldn't be reached for comment.    Kenneth L. Hicks, an Asheboro, N.C., registered representative with Investment Management Research Inc., St. Petersburg, Fla., was fined $50,000. According to the NASD, he used $79,690 from seven customers for his own purposes. He was ordered to disgorge those funds.    In Asheboro, Mr. Hicks said he is disabled with multiple sclerosis and is not presently employed. The 44-year-old said, &quot;I embezzled the money&quot; in 1986 because &quot;I needed it.&quot; He said he regrets the embezzlements, but added that there was &quot;no financial harm in the long run for anyone.&quot;    Paul J. Smith, a Conway, S.C., registered representative was fined $150,000 and barred from association with any NASD member. While at Mutual of Omaha Fund Management Co., a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co., NASD said he received checks, cash and negotiable instruments totaling $99,956 from customers. The funds were to be used to purchase securities, but he converted and deposited them in his own bank account, NASD said. Mr. Smith couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
