<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-1094 </DOCNO><TEXT>The temporal waveform of the single longitudinal modes emitted by gain-switchedAlGaAs/GaAs multiple quantum well lasers is analyzed by means of a synchroscanstreak camera system coupled to a spectrograph. It is found that only50% of the number of the longitudinal modes contributing to the time-averagedspectrum are present during the first relaxation oscillation. The time-dependentshift of the envelope of the mode spectrum is quantitatively explainedby a spectral shift of the gain maximum as a function of the time-varyingcharge carrier density. The results demonstrate that, for the analysisof transient multimode spectra of gain-switched injection lasers, inclusionof the energy dependence of the gain and gain compression is mandatory.</TEXT></DOC>
