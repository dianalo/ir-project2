 Although products like Lotus' Symphonyand Ashton-Tate's Framework achieved some success, it was clear that userswanted to be much more selective about their choice of applications,including communications software.andM;Then all-singing, all-dancing windowing environments hit the streets.andP;  Everymanufacturer produced its own version of what Xerox had pioneered and Applehad produced.andM;Well, the common user interface for different manufacturers' products hadmore mileage in it than one supplier's integrated software package.andP;  But thedemands windowing makes on hardware mean that it's often hard for existing PCusers to take advantage of it.andP;  Unless you're prepared to throw away yourslow old ICs and buy lots of extra memory for your new one, a world ofmultiple applications is still out of reach.andM;And, indeed, most communications software is much less demanding of hardware.andO;Older machines are often well suited to the less graphically demanding needsof both communications and terminal emulation.andM;The range of communications software available for PCs today is trulybewildering.andP;  If you're looking for some way of connecting your computer tothe outside world, how do you choose?andM;To start with, you must analyse all the communications activities you'relikely to be involved with on your PC.andM;Do you need a simple terminal emulation package which can ape a DEC VT52 orTeletype terminal and get a Hayes compatible modem to dial up automatically,for example?andP;  If you only use your PC and modem for occasional calls to anon-line service or electronic mailbox, then this is probably all you reallyneed.andP;  This is just the kind of function provided for free with integratedsoftware or at very low cost with basic communications software.andM;What such basic communications utilities miss is the sophistication toautomate connection procedures.andP;  For this you need a scripted communicationspackage which can run macros written in a special high-level language.andM;If you're a regular user of a specific on-line service, the value ofautomation can be measured quite easily.andP;  The aggregate time saved byautomatically logging on to a host system, capturing all unread electronicmail and logging off again is considerable.andM;Another excellent, though little-exploited, technique is to embed controlmessages in your software which can activate various on-line services withouthaving to go through laborious sequences of prompts and responses.andP;  There areno internationally agreed standards governing this technique, however.andM;The catch is that this can only be done with the involvement of the on-lineservice provider, and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that reducingconnection time is unlikely to be the-main aim of a company selling on-lineservices.andM;Compuserve/Forum (see User to user, issue 132) is currently planning tointroduce a package which allows for exactly this embedding of controlmessages.andP;  The embedded commands will be used to improve ease of use byactivating pop-up menus on screen; you can then make your selections fromthese menus.andP;  They also allow on-line and off-line activities to beseamlessly merged.andM;Such features are probably all the average PC user is going to want, but somecommunications packages allow you to do much more.andP;  Most importantly, theycan allow several communications sessions to be supported at the same time.andM;Although this might sound like a waste of time and money, their value comeswhen, in conjunction with terminal emulation features, they can replace thetraditional mainframe terminal on a corporate user's desk.andM;Using multiple sessions, communications with the company mainframe andminicomputer can be maintained while, for example, looking to see if there'sany mail on your Telecom Gold mailbox.andM;Software at this level is now starting to be challenged, to some extent, byWindows and OS/2, which both allow several applications to be run on the PC'sscreen at the same time.andM;However, for specific and complex communications tasks, specialist softwarewill always have the edge.andP;  And there are still all those hardwareconstraints on windowing environments.andM;Another branch of specialist software controls communications that are PC toPC rather than PC to host.andP;  These packages typically allow the transfer offiles.andP;  Many also allow remote users to connect to a PC back at the officeand use it as if its disk were a logical extension of their own machine.andM;This remote disk concept tests current telephone networks fairly severely.andO;Unless you're lucky enough to have a high-speed compressing and errorcorrecting modem, trying to run your spreadsheet back in the office from aportable somewhere in the Cote d'Azur is going to be a slow and expensiveexercise.andM;Users with relatively modest hardware installations don't need to lose outwhen it comes to communications software.andP;  The trick in selecting a packageis to identify what you actually need to do, and not be seduced by what'sactually possible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
