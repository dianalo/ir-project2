The program is a voluntary one and all costs are covered by userfees. The higher fees, including an increase in the current base rate of$19.00 to $33.00 per hour, reflect the increased program costs that haveoccurred since the fees were last adjusted in November 1977.Other changes in the program's regulations will: (1) Permit the Agencyto reject an application for grading service if any payments by the applicantfor prior services have not been paid within 30 days of the billing, ratherthan 60 days as now; (2) delete the requirements of a surety bond for certainprospective industry licensees; (3) modify the list of individual testsin the laboratory analysis schedule for which there are charges; (4) increasethe charges made for such laboratory analysis; (5) delete the charge toapplicants of an administrative charge equal to an additional 10 percentof actual travel expenses; and (6) establish the same hourly rate chargefor the ``assistant'' inspector or grader in resident programs as for theinspector or grader in charge. The increased laboratory charges recognizeincreased program costs and the other changes will result in more efficientprogram operations and reflect greater fiscal responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE</T2>: June 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>: Lynn G.

The Agricultural Marketing Serviceestimates that overall this rule will yield an additional two million dollarsper year over current fees. The Agency does not believe the increases willaffect competition. Furthermore, the dairy grading program is a voluntaryprogram.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Changes Adopted in the Final Rule</ITAG>This document makes the following changes in the regulations implementingthe dairy inspection and grading program:1. Increases the fees for grading and other program services.The current fees for program services have been in effect for over 10 years(since November 1977). During the early 1980's requests for services increasedsignificantly due to increases in milk production. While program expensesdid increase, revenues increased at a higher rate. Accordingly, the programbegan accumulating increased operating reserves. During those years, itwas necessary for all personnel qualified to carry out grading and inspectionwork (including many supervisors) to be fully occupied with revenue-producingwork. By the end of fiscal year 1983, the program had accumulated a reserveof $6.2 million_sufficient revenue to cover nine months of operating expenses.More recently, the volume of grading work has been declining, with an accompanyingdecline in revenue. At the same time, operating costs have continued toincrease, due largely to increases in salaries, travel reimbursements,and other administrative and supervisory costs. Fees remained unchangedand the reserve was reduced. In fiscal years 1984 through 1987, the program'sfinancial reserves were reduced by about $4 million (with annual operatingdeficits of up to $2.3 million). At the end of fiscal year 1987, the reservewas $2.1 million_less than the 4 months of operating reserves (about $3million) that are considered appropriate for the program.Normal operating costs are continuing to increase. In addition, the Agencyhas identified three vital areas that require improvement and added resources_training,supervision and automation.The workload decrease that began in 1986 and continued into 1987 stemmedfrom the Dairy Termination Program and the resulting decline in Governmentpurchases of dairy products under the price support program. The workloadfor 1988 will probably be similar to that of 1987.For the above reasons, fee increases are imperative. Without the increases,the program will lose more than $2 million during fiscal year 1988, whichwould deplete the operating reserve. The Agricultural Marketing Act of1946, which authorizes the inspection and grading program, requires thatfees cover the cost of the services provided.The fee increases (ranging from 18 percent to 74 percent above the currentrates) are lower than the 86 percent increase in the Consumer Price Indexthat occurred during the 10-year period (1977 to 1987) in which gradingfees remained unchanged.2. Redefines when service may be rejected due to late payment.The grading program regulations now state that ``an application for inspectionor grading service may be rejected by the Administrator when payment offees is delinquent over 60 days.'' Current good commercial practice forbilling and collection classifies payments not made within 30 days of billingas delinquent. This final rule permits the Agency to reject an applicationfor grading service if any fees previously billed to the applicant werenot paid within 30 days. The change will encourage the timely payment offees.3. Deletes the requirement of bonding industry personnel involved in USDAgrade label programs.Current regulations require a surety bond from prospective licensees whoare not Federal or State employees and who are not under immediate USDAresident grader supervision. In the dairy grading program, this requirementapplies to those plant employees who have been selected as supervisorsof packaging for USDA grade labeled products. A recent review of the administrationof the program has shown that the surety bond is an unnecessary requirement.No claims have been made by the Agency against existing bonds for violationsby licensed and bonded plant employees in the performance of their duties.This final rule eliminates the surety bond requirement for plant employees.4. Deletes laboratory fees for tests which are no longer provided by theDairy Division. Add laboratory fees for new tests that are available.In addition to the increase in fees for each of the listed laboratory tests,four other laboratory-related changes are adopted to reflect current DairyDivision activities:(a) The test for ``Corn-Soya-Milk'' is deleted because the authority forthe sampling and testing of this product was transferred to the FederalGrain Inspection Service on October 6, 1983.(b) ``Meat and Related Products'' are added to properly identify the specifictests that the Dairy Division is performing for the Agency's Livestockand Seed Division.(c) A fee for antibiotic testing is added for dry milk and related products.(d) A fee for testing process cheese for meltability is added for cheeseand related products. This test is required by the Department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service for cheese-conversion and direct-purchasecontracts for pasteurized process cheese.5. Changes the method for determining travel expenses.The current regulations provide that, in addition to travel costs, perdiem and other expenses, applicants are to be charged an additional 10percent of those expenses ``to cover administrative costs of AMS.'' Thefee increases include administrative and supervisory costs associated withthe program. Therefore, the additional 10 percent charges are no longernecessary. This final rule eliminates the additional 10 percent requirement.6. Changes the method for calculating the rate for determining continuousresident service.Current regulations provide a two-tiered rate schedule for the inspectoror grader in charge of a resident program and an assistant inspector orgrader. Current operational costs do not justify a lower charge for theassistant as now provided in the regulations. This final rule will establishthe same charge for any assistant resident inspector or grader as for theinspector or grader in charge.7. Makes miscellaneous non-substantive changes to clarify several of theprovisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Industry Comments</ITAG>A rulemaking document proposing the changes discussed above was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 17, 1988 (53 FR 4639). A 30-day commentperiod was provided so that interested persons could submit their viewsand comments. At the request of industry members, the comment period wasextended 14 days, to April 1, 1988.The Agency received comments from 11 parties, including proprietary processors,dairy cooperatives, and nationwide industry organizations. The commentsand the Agency's responses are set forth below.Many of the comments focused on the economic impact that the proposed increasein program fees would have on processors of dairy products and on milkproducers. It was contended that the magnitude of the increases would makeit difficult for processors to pass these additional costs along throughthe marketing chain. Processors claimed that they would have to absorbthe fee increases or reduce their pay prices to the dairy farmers supplyingthem with milk.With respect to other comments in opposition to the fee increases, onecommenter believed that the current efforts to automate program operationsshould yield offsetting savings. Another party stated that the fee increaseswere in excess of the current rate of inflation. It was also suggestedthat the quality of service has declined. Other commenters indicated thatthe program needed to be operated more efficiently and that the staffinglevel should be reduced. One commenter stated that the Agency should haveincreased its fees more frequently, thus avoiding fee increases of themagnitude that was being proposed.In another comment, it was urged that the fee increases be phased in overa two-year period. The commenter proposed that during this phase-in periodthe Agency undertake an extensive study of how to operate the program moreefficiently.The concerns about the size of the fee increases are understandable. Theincreases are substantial and undoubtedly will have an impact on thoseprocessors using the program's services. In this regard, processors willhave to decide how best to assimilate these additional costs into theiroperations. Some may even conclude that it is no longer desirable to usethe inspection and grading program.As stated earlier in this document, the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946requires that the cost of the grading program be borne through user fees.It is thus necessary to set the fees at a level that assures that the programcosts are covered. As noted, the program has been operating for some timeat a loss because of inadequate fees. However, higher fees were not institutedearlier because of the excess financial reserves that were generated bythe heavy workload during the period of unusually heavy milk supplies.With the reserve fund nearly depleted, it is imperative that the programfees be increased immediately by the amounts adopted herein. The programcannot continue to operate at a deficit.The Agency will continue to make every effort to operate the program asefficiently as possible. Program operations, such as staffing, automation,and quality of services, are continuously under review by program managers,and operating costs are monitored closely. The intent is to have a programthat is cost-effective and at the same time responsive to the needs ofthe industry and the need for program integrity.Several commenters indicated that they believe that there is a need forindustry input into the operation of the inspection and grading program.It was their position that a concerted effort should be made to find waysof improving the efficiency of the program and reducing program costs.The Agency is committed to the effective implementation and efficient managementof the program. It is prepared to participate in dialogue with individualsand groups on such matters.A number of parties expressed concern about the program costs associatedwith the testing of dairy products. It was suggested that testing costscould be reduced through the centralization of laboratories or by contractingout testing activities to private laboratories. It also was suggested thatany laboratory fee increases be delayed until a cost comparison could bemade regarding commercial vs. Agency laboratories.For the reasons already described, it is necessary to implement the feeincreases as soon as possible. However, the Agency is willing to explorethe laboratory issue with the industry to ascertain whether there are morecost-effective means of providing the testing services desired by industrymembers. In addition, the Agency is currently reviewing the operation ofall Agency laboratories to determine if changes are desirable. These includethe possible centralization of laboratories and more extensive oversight.It was requested that implementation of the fee increases be delayed sothat processors would not become subject to higher fees during existingprocessing contracts. The concern was that processors could not recoverfrom their market outlets an increase in fees that occurs during the courseof a contract.As indicated, an immediate increase in fees is needed to stem the currentoperating losses. Thus, there should be no delay in the fee increases.However, in view of the time needed to complete this rulemaking action,the new fees will not become effective until June 19, 1988. The shouldprovide most members of the industry with the opportunity to reflect thehigher fees in bids on future contracts. It also is noted that the industrywas forewarned about possible fee increases. This occurred through industrypublications, varous industry meetings, and the proposed rule that waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 17, 1988.Several commenters were concerned about having to absorb an increase infees under the inspection and grading program. To help offset the fee increases,they requested that the Department increase the ``make allowance'' underthe dairy price support program. Through this means, processors presumablywould be able to recover more of their operating costs, which includesgrading fees, through the value of the products sold under the supportprogram.Grading fees are established pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Actof 1946 which authorizes the Agricultural Marketing Service inspectionand grading program and requires that such fees cover the cost of servicesprovided. The price support program is administered by the AgriculturalStabilization and Conversation Service which estimates industry costs ofmanufacturing butter, cheese and nonfat dry milk. This estimate, or ``makeallowance,'' is then used as one of several factors in setting the purchaseprices under the support program for surplus dairy products. Since theprice support program is administered by another Agency pursuant to differentauthority, the commenters suggestion is outside the scope of this rulemakingand cannot be included herein. One commenter was concerned about the recent decision by the Agency torequire additional inspectors/graders at certain plants. Although not specificallystated in the comments, it is presumed that the concern stems from theadditional costs that these plants would incur in using the additionalinspection and grading services. The decision to require additional Agency employees at certain plants wasbased on the determination that this is necessary to assure the integrityof the inspection and grading program. In some cases, it is not possiblefor one inspector to monitor a plant's processing activities to the extentthe Agency considers necessary. This may be because the plant's operationsare simply too large for one person to monitor, or the plant has extendedhours of operation, or the various activities to be monitored are spreadout over several areas of the plant. The Agency decided in some situationsthat additional staffing was necessary to assure that the purpose of theservices being provided was in fact being carried out. This, of course,means additional costs to the processors who are affected by this decision.Certain commentors asked that the Agency provide the industry with additionalinformation concerning costs under the inspection and grading program.The requests were as follows: (1) Provide an up-to-date benchmark of costper hundredweight of grading as an industry average to assist the industryin evaluating individual plant costs, and (2) provide the percentage ofrevenues being allocated for training, overhead, computer processing, andother support elements under the program. The Agency is willing to work with the industry in developing informationregarding program costs. A dialog between the Agency and industry memberson this issue will facilitate the compilation of data that will be mostuseful to the industry. One commenter objected to the fee increases partly because the fees donot recognize regional differences in labor costs. It was claimed thatlabor costs in his area were much lower than in other areas of the countryand that the program fees were too high relative to the salaries of theState employees who are doing the program work in his area for the Agency.It is impractical to recognize in the fees charged a particular plant thesalary and related benefits associated with each individual inspector orgrader who provides service to the plant. The salaries and benefits ofemployees frequently vary. Also, employees are often rotated among plants.The Agency believes that a uniform fee structure represents a fair systemfor charging processors for the services provided. In the proposed rule, the Agency recommended a change in the conditionsunder which an application for service could be rejected by the Agency.Currently, an application for inspection or grading service may be rejectedif any fees previously billed to the applicant were not paid within 60days. It was proposed that this time period be reduced to 30 days. Certaincommentors contended that while they recognized the need for the promptpayment of fees, the 30-day limit was more stringent than what the U.S.Government abides by when paying processors for dairy products purchasedunder the price support program. The parties urged that the 60-day limitbe retained. The Agency has the responsibility for operating the inspection and gradingprogram in a prudent manner. The 30-day limit is in keeping with this responsibilityand will foster the timely payment of fees. <ITAG tagnum="84">Information Collection Requirements and Recordkeeping </ITAG>Information collection requirements and the recordkeeping provision containedin 7 CFR Part 58, Subpart A, have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and havebeen assigned OMB No. 0581-0126. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is hereby found that good cause exists fornot delaying the effective date of this action until 30 days after publicationof this final rule in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 requiresthat fees cover the cost of the services provided under the inspectionand grading program. The present fees are not covering the cost of suchservices, and the program's financial reserves are being depleted. An immediateincrease in fees is essential to the operation of the program. The provisions of this final rule are known to interested parties. A proposedrule setting forth the fee increases and other administrative changes adoptedherein were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 17, 1988. The changes effected bythis final rule will not require extensive preparation or substantial changesin operation by those persons using the program's services. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 58</ITAG>Food grades and standards, Dairy products.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 58, Subpart A isamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 58_[AMENDED]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart A_Regulations Governing the Inspection and Grading Servicesof Manufactured or Processed Dairy Products</ITAG>1.
