He's even been saying neither he nor his closeassociates ever were Marxists.   In his heavily guarded suite in the presidential palace, Najib istrying to build a new image not only for his government but also forhimself, repudiating almost everything about the 1978 revolutionthat installed a pro-Soviet regime in Afghanistan.   He has been brushing off the Marxist tag for himself and hisassociates on the ruling Politburo ever since Soviet troops withdrewin February.   He talks about subjects that once were taboo _ the ``bigmistakes'' made before he assumed power in May 1986, ``half-baked''land and education reform policies launched by his predecessors inthe early years of power.   ``During the past 11 years the revolution has traversed adifficult, complicated and dangerous path with shortcomings, hasteand hurry,'' he said in a recent interview with The AssociatedPress. ``We have learned big lessons of history. The passage of timeis a great teacher.''   Since the last Soviet troops withdrew Feb. 15, Najib has adopteda position that at times sounds as though he would be willing tostep down and leave his People's Democratic Party of Afghanistanwith only a slim guarantee of existence.   Although the party is communist in structure with a standardpolitburo, central committee and youth organization, it advocates afree-market system and accepts the Islamic religion. Its meetingsbegin with readings from the Koran, the Islamic holy book, and Najibis a regular at Friday prayers and often invokes the name of God inhis speeches.   Najib says he only seeks the ``16th seat'' at the negotiatingtable with the seven Moslem guerrilla groups based in Pakistan andthe eight in Iran that are trying to topple his government.   He says he's ready to negotiate with the Moslem guerrillas,through intermediaries, if necessary _ anywhere, anytime and on anyterms.   But the most extreme of the guerrilla leaders and their mainsupporters, the United States and Pakistan, have taken the positionthat Najib and key members of his government must go before theytalk peace. They contend the government trampled on ancient socialand religious traditions and created chaos by opening the way forthe Soviet Union's military intervention in December 1979.   Some of the Moslem guerrillas say they now would favor anegotiated settlement, but the guerrilla government-in-exile, formedin Pakistan after the Soviet withdrawal, still insists Najib must goeven if it means more military action.   Najib says he would resign but maintains that would not end theconflict, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives,destroyed thousands of villages and forced 5 million people _one-third of the population _ into exile in Pakistan and Iran.   ``The departure of a personality or force will not solveAfghanistan's problems,'' the 43-year-old president said in theinterview. ``That can only be done by sitting down at the table andtalking.''   His appeals at times exhibit an air of desperation, but mostdiplomats in Kabul doubt his government is on the verge of militaryor political collapse. On the contrary, they say, Najib's departurecould mean that any coalition government would not survive becauseneither members of his party nor the guerrilla leaders have hispower and authority.   The government has been strengthened by a continuing Sovietairlift of arms and ammunition. The Soviets have promised to standby the Najib government even though the supply costs are enormous,believed to be about $2 billion a year.   Najib's soldiers also have been strong and predictions that theywould join the rebels and that the government would collapse afterthe Soviet withdrawal have not proved true.   ``Who is strong and who is weak?'' Najib said. ``Months have goneby and we're still here. And a year from now, we'll still be here.''   With the Soviet troops gone, Afghans are looking to this summeras a season when the government and the guerrillas may finally talkpeace. They yearn for a political settlement that would end dailyhardships.   Long lines form daily outside bakeries and gasoline stations.Meat and vegetable prices have skyrocketed as high as 10 times lastyear's. Inflation is running at 215 percent, and wages have beenfrozen.   Iran and China, which also backed the guerrillas, are movingtoward supporting a negotiated settlement. Egypt and Turkey havequestioned Washington's policy on Afghanistan. The guerrillas, theysay, lack the battlefield prowess to defeat the government troopsand are so divided among themselves they would be unable to form astable government.   But the United States, which allocated an estimated $600 millionin weapons and other aid to the rebels, says the Kabul governmentdisqualified itself from talks about Afghanistan's future with theterror and destruction that was carried out at its behest.   Rebel leaders claim at least 75,000 people have been killed byKHAD, the Soviet-style secret police, since the Marxists seizedpower April 27, 1978.   Najib, a physician, headed KHAD for six years before he waspicked in May 1986 to succeed Babrak Karmal, now believed to beliving in the Soviet Union.   ``I see no reason to rehash the past,'' Najib replied when askedabout KHAD. ``George Bush once headed a similar organization'' _ theCentral Intelligence Agency _ ``and now he's president of the UnitedStates.''   But Najib's government has started to speak about terror againstits opponents.   So far, most of the talk is confined to the first 20 months ofthe revolutionary regime in 1978-79, when Najib was ambassador toIran. Power during that time was held by Nur Mohammad Taraki, whowas smothered with a pillow in a party feud in September 1979 andwhose successor, Hafizullah Amin, was assassinated shortly after theSoviet troops arrived.   Government officials say only about 1,000 political prisonersremain in Pol-e-Charki prison on the outskirts of Kabul. They sayexecutions, except those ordered by the courts, have stopped.Diplomats from both Eastern and Western nations say they see noevidence that summary executions continue.   The guerrillas, however, contend Afghanistan still holds 12,000to 15,000 political prisoners, a figure accepted by theInternational Committee for the Red Cross.   ``There have been improvements in the situation. We're not sayingwe never made mistakes,'' says Najmuddin Kawyani, a Politburo memberand secretary of the Central Committee.   ``Prison is not a good thing for anyone,'' said the 42-year-oldKawyani, who was jailed briefly with Najib for throwing stones atVice President Spiro Agnew's car when he visited Afghanistan in 1969and then for 16 months during Amin's reign.   However, Kawyani argues, the guerrillas were equally as guilty ofatrocities, killing civil servants and government soldiers who triedto switch sides but were suspected of being informants.   ``Why is the United States keeping mum on human rights violationsby the mujahedeen?'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 2</NOTE></DOC>
