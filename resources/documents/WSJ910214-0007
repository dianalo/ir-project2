Congress handed down a death sentence on Columbia andother thrifts invested in junk bonds when it passed theFinancial Institutions Recovery, Reform and Enforcement Actof 1989. There was no economic basis for this measure since,at the time, high-yield securities were the most profitableinvestments made by thrifts according to the GeneralAccounting Office. The political reason, however, is obvious-- junk bonds were a convenient scapegoat to distractattention from incompetent regulators and congressionalmalfeasance.</LP><TEXT>   This law technically required Sandamp;Ls to sell their junk-bondholdings over five years. But its real effect was to forcethrifts to place virtually their entire portfolios for saleimmediately. Under existing accounting rules, such securitieshad to be marked to market. These rules were passed just asthe junk-bond market was beginning a painful correction --its first in years. As a result, thrifts were saddledinstantly with losses and forced to dump holdings thatrepresented 7% of the total high-yield market -- creating asnowball effect destined to produce casualties. Congress'sassault on the high-yield market was launched even thoughonly 5% of the thrifts ever owned junk bonds.   Columbia's army of professional credit analysts was thelargest in the industry. When government regulators changedthe rules in the middle of the game, they transformed thisonce-profitable thrift into a government-owned basket case.
