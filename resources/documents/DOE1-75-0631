The observed fiber readout is the deformation of the surface witha pattern similar to the underlying fibers. In previous studies, it wasestablished that one of the main factors responsible for fiber readoutis the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) of the resin inthe direction normal to the cosmetic surface. In the current study, thedifferential thermal contraction (Delta-epsilon) between the resin andthe glass fibers, a factor directly relatable to the magnitude of fiberreadout, has been investigated. This direct relationship was examinedby comparing the computed values for the Delta-epsilon with the measuredmagnitude of fiber readout for reinforced polyurethanes (filled withmilled glass or hollow glass spheres) and polyesters (filled with calciumcarbonate). For all experiments, the predicted values for Delta-epsilonwere found to be consistent with the experimental measurements for fiberreadout. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
