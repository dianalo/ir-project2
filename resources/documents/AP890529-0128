It was the first time since 1977 that a craft with Vietnameseboat people reached Japan directly from Vietnam, the office of theU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Japan said.   It said more than 8,000 Vietnamese refugees have arrived inJapan after being picked up by Japanese and non-Japanese shipsoutside the country's territorial waters.   In Singapore, a United Nations officials said 87 Vietnamese boatpeople rescued by a Dutch ocean-going tug were being held aboard aship in international waters awaiting resettlement becauseSingapore refused to accept them.   An official of Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said 71 men, 22women and 14 children were aboard the boat that reached BiryoIsland early Monday, and all of the refugees were reported to be insatisfactory condition. Biryo Island is 48 miles west of Sasebo.   The officials said the Vietnamese told investigators they lefttheir homeland on April 20 and their boat, 18 feet wide, haddrifted for the past week because of trouble with the diesel engine.   At one point the refugees' boat was towed by a ship and theship's crew provided some rice, the Vietnamese said, but they werenot able to identify the ship, according to the official.   The Vietnamese said they had fled Vietnam because of harshconditions and they wanted live in a ``peaceful place,'' said theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said it was notknown why the unidentified ship had not picked up the boat people.   About 8,900 Vietnamese refugees had arrived in Japan sincecommunist forces defeated the U.S.-backed government in SouthVietnam in April 1975. Of those, 2,500 settled in Japan and theremainder left for other countries including the United States,Canada and Australia.   The U.N. official in Singapore said the government refused toallow the Dutch tug to land because it was not scheduled to call atSingapore. He said the government asked the U.N. High Commissionerfor Refugees to send the refugees to another country.   The tug Santania rescued the Vietnamese from a sinking boat inthe South China Sea on May 16 and arrived at Singapore May 21,according to the official. He said the tug was en route from SouthKorea to Saudi Arabia when it saved the refugees.   ``Last Friday we hired a boat and had the refugees transferredfrom the tug to a ship which is now lying in internationalwaters,'' he said. ``We hope to finalize formalities to send them,most likely to the Philippines, during the next two weeks.''   Singapore bars refugees unless other countries provideguarantees that they will accept them within three months.</TEXT></DOC>
