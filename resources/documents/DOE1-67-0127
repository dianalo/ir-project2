In the light microscope, well outlined foci ofmyocytes with distrophic alterations, edema of the myocardial stroma,and multiple focal hemorrhages were observed. The glycogen content inmyocytes was reduced. The ultrastructural picture was dominated by anenlargement to disintegration of mitochondria and focal splitting ofmyofibrils in the myocytes. Capillary endothelia mostly showed signsof hydropic swelling. The changes in the nucleoplasmic ratios of myocardialmyocytes, in the size of myocyte nuclei, and the size of the relativevolumes of the basic myocardial components, i.e. of myocytes and theinterstitium, were assessed quantitatively.
