In the nodalizationtechnique, the flux is expanded into polynomials about the center pointof each node. The phase angles and the magnitudes of the two-energy groupdetector adjoint functions were calculated for a neutron detector locatedin the middle of the south core tank of the Iowa State University UTR-10reactor using a one-dimensional computer code. Results were comparedwith the exact analytical solution and were found to be within 2% ofthe values obtained from the analytical solution. Using a two-dimensionalcomputer code, the phase angle and the magnitude of the one-energy groupdetector adjoint function was calculated for a detector located in thecenter of a 200 cm x 200 cm reactor. Results were within 3% of the valuesobtained from the analytical solution and the computer code EXTERMINATOR.</TEXT></DOC>
