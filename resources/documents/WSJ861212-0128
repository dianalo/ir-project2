The press curbs promulgated yesterday toughen those imposed along with the state of emergency on June 12. They aim to blackout news relating to most forms of anti-government resistance -- from violence in black townships to peaceful protests against conscription.    The restrictions require reporters to seek government clearance for stories and film about security force action, banned meetings, boycotts, detainees and &quot;subversive statements.&quot; The government also has the power to ban for as many as three months any publication that &quot;persists with the publishing of prohibitied material.&quot;    The action follows a statement by State President P.W. Botha that South Africa is under a &quot;revolutionary onslaught&quot; and that media controls needed &quot;pepping up.&quot; Yesterday, Dave Steward, deputy director of the Bureau for Information, said &quot;the media is being exploited by revolutionaries.&quot; Earlier in the week, several cabinet ministers met with the National Newspaper Union and tried unsuccessfully to get the media to agree to self-censorship.    The South African press reacted to the new measures with outrage. &quot;(The) government today unceremoniously dumps this country into the totalitarian camp,&quot; said Business Day, a financial paper.    &quot;The final nail into the coffin of press freedom has been hammered in by the government,&quot; wrote the Sowetan, a newspaper with a wide black readership. &quot;The press as we have known it is dead.&quot;    Added Hal Miller, the executive chairman of the Argus publishing group: &quot;The flickering lamp of freedom has dimmed alarmingly.&quot;    There was international criticism as well, but the South African government, which has been circling the wagons following the imposition of international economic sanctions and a wave of corporate disinvestment, seems indifferent to world opinion. One government official said earlier this week that the Botha government has &quot;a sense of disillusionment with the outside world.&quot;    Anti-apartheid organizations are worried that the press restrictions are a signal that they will be targeted for further crackdowns. The groups -- whose activities are generally included in the restrictions -- include the United Democratic Front, the main legal anti-apartheid organization; the End Conscription Campaign, the country's draft resisters; the National Education Crisis Committee, and the unions.    Government opponents said the new press measures will sharply curtail public criticism, even by members of Parliament, and will further separate the white and black communities by keeping the whites even more in the dark about what is happening in the black townships.    Now, the anti-apartheid Black Sash organization said, &quot;The lights will go out in South Africa, effectively preventing the mobilization of nonviolent opposition to apartheid.&quot;    The new restrictions prohibit the publication of news and information in connection with:    --actions or movements of the security forces;    -- restricted gatherings such as funerals of persons whodied during political unrest;   --politically inspired actions of civil disobedience, and boycott actions, such as school, business and rent payment boycotts;    -- illegal alternative structures which take away thepowers of local authorities and the courts;   --statements by people the government has taken action against under the state of emergency; and    -- the arrest and detention of people under the emergencyregulations, the treatment they receive in detention, andtheir release from detention.   The government's Bureau for Information said media reports touching on the restricted areas are to be submitted for government clearance.    The definition of a subversive statement has been broadened to include statements which encourage people to, among other things:    --take part in a boycott action;    -- take part in civil disobedience;   --stay away from work or strike illegally;    -- attend a restricted gathering;   --set up power structures outside the existing government, such as unofficial local governments;    -- prosecute or punish people outside legal structures, asdo so-called people's courts in some townships; and   --undermine compulsory military service for white males.    Exemptions to the new restrictions are statements released by the government or statements made in parliamentary debates, government deliberations and judicial proceedings. The penalty for violating the measures is a fine of as much as $9,000 or 10 years imprisonment. </TEXT></DOC>
