(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sixteen men, mostly boat captains andtruck drivers, have been acquitted in what authorities said was amarijuana smuggling ring with links to deposed Panamanian dictatorManuel Antonio Noriega.   Four of the 20 co-defendants were convicted Monday on the fifthday of deliberations in the 2{-month trial.   ``I think the entire trial was a defeat for the prosecution,''said Rick Michot, a defense attorney.   The defendants had been charged with conspiracy, importation anddistribution. Federal prosecutors said the defendants smuggled48,000 pounds of marijuana into North Carolina in 1982 and 280,000pounds into Louisiana in 1983.   They planned to smuggle 1 million pounds into Missouri in 1984,prosecutors said, but were foiled by the arrest of ringleaderStephen Michael Kalish. Kalish testified as the star prosecutionwitness that what he called the ``Master Blaster'' load was toarrive a few days before he was arrested.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Lombardino, the chief prosecutor,refused to comment after the verdicts, saying a related trial of 25people is coming up.   The cases resulted from the same investigation that led toNoriega's 1988 indictment in Tampa, Fla., on drug charges.   Kalish testified that he once gave Noriega a $300,000``present'' for helping arrange a Panamanian banking network tolaunder drug profits. He said the network he set up with Noriegalaundered $50 million to $100 million a month for the Medellincocaine cartel of Colombia.   One juror, Rowdy Lege, 30, said some members of the panel``voiced concern'' over Noriega's involvement, and the possibilityof retaliation by drug lords.   Convicted on 16 counts were Jerry Hughey of Austin, Texas; JimSwope, also of Texas; and Max Wade, no hometown available. Theycould be sentenced to 170 years in prison. Steve Ellender of Houma,La., was found guilty on six conspiracy counts and innocent onseven others. He could be sentenced to 30 years.   U.S. District Judge John Shaw postponed sentencing until after abackground check of the four.   Patricia Thomas, Ellender's attorney, said she will appeal ongrounds of an ``inconsistent verdict.''   Some of the defendants who were acquitted said it was abittersweet victory.   ``I feel kind of used,'' said Phillip Watkins. ``Win or losewe've already lost.''   Clark Nash of Missouri said he's broke, and doesn't know what todo.   ``Everything I've worked for for 30 years went to my lawyer,''he said.   Kalish, who said his drug-smuggling organization operated fromthe late 1970s through 1984, is currently in prison. He pleadedguilty in Tampa in 1987 to a charge of continuing criminalenterprise.   In November, Jay Foreman, a pilot who said he flew a privateairplane for Kalish, testified that Noriega was a passenger aboardthe plane several times.   Originally 187 people were accused in the case, but manyplea-bargained or were culled for separate trials. The judgeacquitted three before the defense opened.   Officials say about 90 of those indicted remain fugitives.   The conspiracy centered on the smuggled marijuana. The othercharges dealt with aiding and abetting the importation anddistribution.   Hughey, Swope and Wade were convicted on all those counts, plusthree each of wire fraud, interstate commerce and the illegaldistribution of funds from the conspiracy.   In the next trial, for Feb. 12, 19 of the defendants are accusedof higher-level involvement in the ring. Among them is Harold``Doc'' McGhee, manager of the rock groups Bon Jovi, Skid Row andThe Scorpions.   Kalish identified McGhee as the link between the smuggler and aColombian drug supplier. McGhee was given a suspended sentenceafter pleading guilty to importing marijuana in North Carolina.</TEXT></DOC>
