L. 100-233,which was enacted on January 6, 1988. On April 5, 1988 the Board proposedamendments to Subparts A, B, C, and O of Part 615, and requested publiccomment. Comments were received from the Farm Credit System banks in theSpringfield, Baltimore and Texas Districts, the Central Bank for Cooperatives,and the Farm Credit Corporation of America. After reviewing the proposedrule and incorporating changes reflecting comments received, on September28, 1988 the Board resolicited comments on the proposed rule. In responseto the resolicitation of comments, comments were received from the FarmCredit System banks in the Louisville and Baltimore Districts. The Boardnow adopts a final rule. Subpart A of Part 615 contains regulations that define the funding activitiesof the banks of the Farm Credit System and the role of the Federal FarmCredit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation). The only commentconcerning proposed amendments to the regulations contained in SubpartA was received in response to the resolicitation of comments, from theFarm Credit Banks of Louisville (Louisville), which commented that andSection;615.5030(a) needed to be reworded in order to make it clear that each bank'sboard must authorize that bank's commercial borrowing. Since the Systembank's boards of directors cannot act jointly in one resolution, the Boardbelieves the meaning to be clear, but revises the wording to make thatmeaning more explicit. In addition, the Board revises the wording of andSection;615.5010(a) to more closely follow the wording of andSection; 4.9 of theAct. Subpart B of Part 615 contains regulations concerning the collateral requiredto support obligations issued by Farm Credit System banks. Comments concerningproposed amendments to Subpart B were initially received from the FarmCredit Corporation of America (FCCA) and the Farm Credit System banks inthe Springfield District. In addition, in response to the resolicitationof comments, comments were received from the Farm Credit System banks inthe Louisville District. FCCA commented that proposed andSection; 615.5050 might be read to implya requirement that promissory notes given in conventional banking transactionsbe collateralized. Regulations of Subpart B of Part 615 are meant to protectinvestors in bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations by settingminimum standards for collateral required to support those types of obligationsissued by Farm Credit System banks. These standards are not meant to requirethat all credit extended to a Farm Credit System institution from whateversource be similarly collateralized, nor to restrict commercial banks andother creditors from making their own credit decisions in private lendingtransactions. Accordingly, andSection; 615.5050(a) has been revised to deletethe words ``all other known and recorded liabilities.'' In addition, in response to the resolicitation of comments, Louisville,noting that the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC)is issuing uncollateralized debt, commented that andSection; 615.5050(a)should be revised to permit the Farm Credit System to issue uncollateratizedsecurities. However, andSection; 4.3(c) of the Act requires that ``any note,bond, debenture or similar obligation'' issued by any Farm Credit Systembank be collateralized. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 amended andSection;4.3(c) of the Act by deleting the words ``long-term,'' making it clearthat all obligations issued by Farm Credit System banks, regardless ofmaturity, must be collateralized. FAC is not a Farm Credit System bank,subject to the collateral requirements of andSection; 615.5050(a), but, rather,is expressly authorized by andSection; 6.26 of the Act to issue ``uncollateralizedbonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations.'' Farm Credit Systembanks are not authorized to issue uncollateralized securities. Accordingly,the Board does not make the suggested revision to andSection; 615.5050(a).Finally, the wording of andSection; 615.5050(a) has been revised to moreclosely follow the wording of section 4.3(c) of the Act, and to providethat cash equivalents approved by the Farm Credit Administration may serveas collateral. The Farm Credit System banks in the Springfield District (Springfield commentedconcerning proposed andSection; 615.5050(c). Springfield suggested that thecollateral value of loans and acquired property should be their ``net valueless allowance for losses,'' and that the reference to ``recovery value''in andSection; 615.5050(c)(2) should be replaced with ``net realizable value.''Section 615.6050(c) is now being revised to clarify the method for determiningthe value of collateral. The terms ``recovery value'' and ``investmentvalue'' are eliminated. The revised andSection; 615.5050(c)(1) provides that,in general, the collateral value of a loan is the unpaid balance of theloan, less any appropriate allowance for losses. Revised andSection; 615.5050(c)(2)provides that the collateral value of loans in the process of liquidationor foreclosure, judgments, and sales contracts is the unpaid balance ofthe loans, judgments or contracts, less any appropriate allowance for losses.Revised andSection; 615.5050(c)(3) provides that the collateral value ofa restructured loan is the unpaid balance of the loan, less any appropriateallowance for losses. Section 615.5050(c)(4) is redesignated as andSection;615.5050(c)(5) and a new andSection; 615.5050(c)(4) provides that the collateralvalue of property acquired in the liquidation of loans is the book value,determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices adjustedfor any allowance for losses. In order to accurately reflect the valueof the collateral, the allowance for losses must be updated on an ongoingbasis. In response to the resolicitation of comments, Louisville commented thatandSection; 615.5050(c)(4) does not specify the collateral value of acquiredproperty sold or otherwise disposed of. Section 615.5050(c)(2), as revised,provides for the valuation of all sales contracts, including sales contractsfor acquired property, if such sales are financed by the bank. FCCA suggested that the proposed regulation could be read to eliminatesecured interbank loans from eligible collateral. In response to the comment,the Board is adding andSection; 615.5050(c)(6) to specifically state thata secured interbank loan may serve as collateral for obligations issuedby the bank making such loan, provided that the loan is adequately securedby assets which, if held by the lending bank, would have been eligiblecollateral. In computing its eligible collateral, the borrowing bank isprohibited from counting the assets securing the loan. A new andSection;615.5045 provides definitions for ``cost,'' ``market value,'' ``securedinterbank loan,'' and ``unpaid balance,'' as these terms are used in subpartB. In response to the resolicitation of comments, Louisville commented thatandSection; 615.05050(c)(5), which excludes from collateral the excess ofany loan over the ``maximum amount authorized under the Act or Part 614of these regulations,'' should be revised to exclude the excess of anyloan over the maximum amount authorized under the Act and ``those provisionsof the regulations strictly adhering to the amounts set by the Act.'' Section4.3(c) of the Act requires that each Farm Credit System bank hold as collateral``notes and obligations representing <T3>loans made under this Act</T3>'' (emphasis added). That portion ofa loan which exceeds maximum limitations contained in the Act or in anyFCA regulation made pursuant to the Act, is properly excluded from collateral.The Board does not make the suggested revision, as the regulations conformto the provisions of the Act. FCCA commented that the words ``or association'' should be added afterthe word ``bank'' each time it appears in andSection; 615.5060(a). FCCA alsosuggested that a reference to section 1.7(a) of the Act be added. The Boardis making these revisions in the language of andSection; 615.5060(a) to clarifythat the entire paragraph is meant to apply not only to banks, but alsoto those associations which may have direct real estate lending authority.Louisville requested that a <T3>de minimis </T3>exception for small real estate mortgage loans be addedto andSection; 615.5060(a). Section 1.10 of the Act requires that real estatemortgage loans be secured by a first lien. Section 615.5060(a) providesa grace period for obtaining evidence of the first lien. Although the Boardbelieves it is appropriate to continue to provide such a grace period forobtaining evidence of the first lien, the Board does not feel it is appropriateto dilute the statutory requirement that a first lien exist. Subpart C of Part 615 contains regulations governing the issuance of notes,bonds, debentures, and similar obligations by Farm Credit System institutions.Subpart C was revised to reflect new responsibilities of the Funding Corporationwhich were previously exercised by the Farm Credit System finance committee.Comments were received from the Farm Credit System banks in the BaltimoreDistrict, the Farm Credit System banks in the Texas District, the CentralBank for Cooperatives, and FCCA concerning the proposed amendments to regulationscontained in Subpart C. FCCA indicated concern that reference to sales of securities to ``membersof the general public'' in andSection; 615.5100 (a) through (c) might beinterpreted to preclude private placement of securities. The Board agreesand has deleted the references in andSection; 615.5100 to ``members of thegeneral public.'' Section 615.5101(b) requires that each debt obligation be authorized bya resolution of the board of directors of the issuing Farm Credit Systembanks. FCCA expressed concern that this regulation could be read to requirethat the banks adopt a specific resolution for each issue of debt. At present,each bank's board of directors authorizes Systemwide obligations by a periodicresolution which states a maximum amount of obligations which may be issued.The proposed regulation does not require a change in this practice, butdoes require that each obligation of whatever kind be authorized by anappropriate resolution of the board of directors of each issuing bank.The frequency of resolutions consistent with the duty of directors or exercisetheir judgment effectively is left to the determination of the board ofdirectors of the issuing bank. The introductory paragraph of the proposedregulation is clarified by deleting the words ``issuance of'' and insertingan exception referring to the provisions of section 4.2(e) of the Act.Section 615.5101(e)(1) requires consultation by Farm Credit System representativeswith the Secretary of Treasury. FCCA suggested that, in order to avoiduncertainty, FCA should, in its regulation, expressly designate the FundingCorporation as the Farm Credit System's representative for this purpose.The FCA Board does not agree with the FCCA suggestion. The decision whetherto delegate this responsibility to the Funding Corporation is a managementdecision for the Farm Credit System banks. The Farm Credit System banks in the Texas District and the Central Bankfor Cooperative raised a concern that andSection; 615.5102(a) might be readto imply that the Funding Corporation has authority to approve the amount,maturities, rates of interest, terms and conditions of individual bankobligations. The FCA Board amends andSection; 615.5102(a) to clarify thatthis aspects of the Funding Corporation's authority is limited to joint,consolidated and Systemwide obligations. The Farm Credit System banks in the Texas District (Texas) also expressedconcern that the revision of andSection; 615.5102(a) not imply that the FundingCorporation has absolute authority over the funding operations of individualsbanks. Texas points out that the former law provided that the finance committeesdetermined each bank's participation in joint, consolidated and Systemwidedebt issues. Texas suggested that the phrase ``taking into considerationthe needs of the individual System banks'' be added after the word ``Act.''The Board does not make this revision of andSection; 615.5102(a), but doesrevise the wording of andSection; 615.5101(a) to make these provisions moreconsistent. Section 615.5102(a), as originally proposed, basically restatesandSection; 4.9. Section 4.9 of the Act and andSection; 615.5102(a) both includethe words ``acting for the banks of the Farm Credit System.'' Sensitivityto the needs of the banks is also built into the Funding Corporation'sstructure, since four of the members of its board of directors are requiredto be current or former directors of System banks, and three are requiredto be Chief Executive Officers or presidents of Farm Credit System banks.Section 615.5102 was not meant to change the relationship of the FundingCorporation with the Farm Credit System banks. It is not the intent ofthis section of the regulation to further define the relationship thatexists between the Funding Corporation and the Farm Credit System banks.Although it is correct that the Funding Corporation does not have absoluteauthority over the funding of the banks, the amendment of andSection; 615.5102(a)suggested by Texas is deemed unnecessary in light of the overall tenorof this section. Furthermore, it is to be noted that andSection; 4.9(b)(2)of the Act provides that the Funding Corporation shall, with Farm CreditAdministration approval, establish ``conditions of participation'' in issuancesof joint, consolidated or Systemwide obligations. If a bank were to failto meet such conditions, it could be excluded from participation in suchissuances. The FCCA requests clarification of andSection;andSection; 615.5101(d) and 615.5102(c),which require FCA approval of each issue of debt. FCCA is concerned thatthese sections might be interpreted to preclude the current FCA methodof approving guidelines for sales of daily discount notes. At present,the Farm Credit System banks utilize several different marketing strategies,each requiring different FCA approval methods to provide necessary programmonitoring and to enable the Funding Corporation to market the debt instruments.The Board believes that the method of FCA's approval should continue tohave flexibility to adjust to the Farm Credit System banks' funding programand does not prescribe in andSection; 615.5101 or andSection; 615.5102 onlyone method of FCA approval of the issuance of securities.In order to clarify FCA approval responsibility for all debt issues, theBoard is revising andSection; 615.5101(d) to eliminate the cross-referenceto andSection; 615.5102.The Farm Credit System banks in the Baltimore District commented initiallythat proposed changes in Part 615 did not appear to affect the mode ofoperations of its Puerto Rican subsidiary and the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimoresubmitted the same comment in response to the resolicitation of comments.Both comments were addressed to the application of the regulation to aparticular institution. The Board does not express any opinion about suchcomments. Each Farm Credit institution must determine for itself how theproposed regulation affects it.Subpart O of Part 615 contains regulations governing the form in whichFarm Credit securities may be issued. FCCA suggested that the listing ofdenominations in andSection; 615.5450 is more reflective of definitive securitiesthan a mature book-entry system. The Board agrees that specific mentionof denominations other than a minimum denomination is unnecessary. However,consistent with a book-entry system, a minimum multiple amount is specified.The revised regulation deletes paragraph (b) of the proposed regulationand redesignates paragraphs (c) and (d) as paragraphs (b) and (c). FCCAcommented that andSection; 615.5450(b) (as redesignated) should be revisedto provide for issuance of consolidated notes, debentures or similar obligations,as well as consolidated bonds, in book-entry form. The Board is makingthis revision in andSection; 615.5450(b) and a similar revision in andSection;615.5450(a), in order to standardize procedures for issuance of Systemwideand consolidated debt securities in book-entry form.It is unnecessary to add additional language to andSection; 615.5450(c) (asredesignated), as suggested by FCCA, in order to permit delegation of approvalof issuance of securities in definitive form, since such authority maygenerally be delegated.Finally, the Board has made other minor editorial and technical changesin the regulations contained in Subparts A, B, C, and O of Part 615.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 615</ITAG>Accounting, Agriculture, Banks, banking, Government securities, Investments,Rural areas.For the reasons stated in the preamble, Part 615 of Chapter VI, Title 12of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 615_FUNDING AND FISCAL AFFAIRS, LOAN POLICIES AND OPERATIONS,AND FUNDING OPERATIONS</ITAG>1.
