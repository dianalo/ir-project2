Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in Section (A), (B), and (C), below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule ChangeThe proposed change is based on section 102(b)(7) of the General CorporationLaw of the State of Delaware, under which the Exchange is organized, whichallows corporations to adopt provisions in their Certificates of Incorporationlimiting or eliminating the potential monetary liability of directors.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), which is alsoincorporated in Delaware, submitted a similar proposal to amend its certificateof incorporation to exempt members of the PSE's Board of Governors frommonetary liability to the PSE or its members for a breach of their fiduciaryduty as a governor. <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-PSE-88-1. Notice of the proposed rule change wasgiven in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25549, April 6, 1988, 53 FR12488. At the request of the Commission staff the PSE subsequently submittedan amendment to its proposed rule change to exclude from its proposed exemptionfrom liability for members of its Board of Governors circumstances wherethe liability arose, directly or indirectly, as a result of a violationof the Federal securities laws. See amendment No. 1 to File No. SR-PSE-88-01.The amendment does not eliminate a Governor's duty of care, which requiresGovernors to exercise informed business judgment in discharging their duties.Rather, the personal liability of the Exchange's Governors to the Exchangeor its members will be limited should they fail, through negligence orgross negligence to satisfy this duty. Such limitations do not apply inthe following circumstances:(1) Breach of the duty of loyalty to the Exchange or its members; i.e.,the responsibility to conduct business in good faith and in the honestbelief that the action taken is in the best interest of the Exchange.(2) Acts or omissions that are not performed in good faith, or which involveintentional misconduct or violation of law.(3) Unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful purchase or redemption ofstock.(4) Transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefits.The amendment does not eliminate other equitable legal remedies, such asrescission or injunctive actions and in no way affects a Governor's liabilityunder federal securities laws. In addition, it does not eliminate the liabilityof officers of the Exchange for actions taken in that capacity, even ifthat individual is also a Governor. This amendment does not apply to theliability of a Governor for acts or omissions which may have occurred priorto its approval.The Exchange believes the amendment is a necessary measure in order tohelp assure its ability to recruit and retain competent Governors. Withoutthe protections offered by the proposed change, the Exchange believes therewill be a deterrent effect upon the entrepreneurial decision-making ofits Governors. In addition, due to the increased numbers and magnitudeof lawsuits against directors, many other Delaware corporations have alreadyadopted similar provisions.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ See footnote 1.The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 in that the protections offered by the amendment helpto remove impediments to attracting competent Governors and thus will helpassure the fair representation of members in the selection of directorsand administration of the affairs of the Exchange and will help attractdirectors which are representatives of issuers and investors.(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe Midwest Stock Exchange, Incorporated does not believe that any burdenswill be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants or OthersComments were neither solicited nor received.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action</ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> or within such longer period (i) as the Commissonmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as towhich the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A)By order approve the proposed rule change, or (B) institute proceedingsto determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
