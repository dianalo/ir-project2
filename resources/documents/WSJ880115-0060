Crude-oil closed on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $17.21 a barrel, up 62 cents.    Trading on the Merc started lower but traders said the market exploded late in the day on rumors that OPEC was going to voluntarily reduce output. Despite skepticism, heavy trading was spurred by reports that four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates and Iran -- this weekend would announce a production cutback of a million barrels a day, to 16 million barrels a day.    &quot;I'd like to see proof,&quot; said an OPEC skeptic, Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Mr. Barakat asserted that OPEC is &quot;just trying to bull the market up. And my feeling is they're just full of bull.&quot;    Another positive factor, analysts said, was an official denial by the Saudis that the kingdom has been offering discounts from official OPEC prices, as had been reported. Still, Mr. Barakat and other industry sources said it is clear such discounts are being offered.    &quot;It was a crazy day,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. &quot;It's important we closed over the $17 level. Two days ago it looked very very negative. They really had this market on the ropes and they couldn't finish it off.&quot;    Some bullish analysts said they think the market may have turned the corner because of the indications OPEC has decreased output -- or at least says it will. As is common, bitter cold weather in the Northeast helped support prices because of possible increased heating-oil demand.    For the future, prices are expected to fluctuate as they did yesterday whenever OPEC members indicate output and prices might be shifting, despite analysts' skepticism of cartel members' motives.    &quot;The big question mark is: What exactly are the Saudi goals? Do they want higher prices? Do they want lower prices?&quot; said one analyst.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold-futures prices jumped higher on heavy buying in anticipation of today's monthly U.S. merchandise-trade report. If the report depresses the U.S. dollar, as some precious-metals traders anticipate, gold will benefit. The strength in crude oil also boosted gold prices. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery rose $6.60, to $488.20. Current-delivery silver &quot;came for the ride,&quot; said David Sobotka, manager of bullion trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., rising 9.4 cents to $6.872. &quot;I think that maybe the bet people are making is that if the number is good, gold won't go down much, but if the number is bad, it could go up,&quot; Mr. Sobotka said. James Riley, chief bullion dealer at J. Aron andamp; Co., a unit of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said traders bought heavily because they know it'll be &quot;too late&quot; today if the trade report depresses the dollar.    COPPER: Futures prices declined for the third consecutive session, but after a low point in early trading rebounded to partly recover losses. March copper, traded as low as $1.04 a pound in the first half hour of activity, but moved irregularly higher to end at $1.078 a pound, down 1.05 cents. William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., said one sign that the bottom may have been reached was that the premiums commanded by near-most contract months over deferred ones -- which reflect supply tightness -- were more stable. The cash-position premium over three-months delivery in London recovered from early weakness to show a slight loss. In New York, the March premium actually widened over May as the May contract ended 2.2 cents lower, more than twice the March loss.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of grain and soybean futures finished mixed in quiet trading. Most traders were settling or holding positions until the release of Agriculture Department reports on grain and oilseed production, stocks and demand. The reports, released after the close, were viewed by analysts to be bullish for corn and soybean markets but negative for the wheat market. &quot;It's certainly going to add some luster to prices,&quot; said Richard Loewy, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. The department said corn use rose 10% during September and November over the previous period as stocks fell to 248 million metric tons. The soybean surplus shrank 10% to 47.8 million metric tons. Final soybean and corn production numbers were also lower than analysts had expected. Final corn output was 7.064 billion bushels; 1.905 billion bushels of beans were produced. Today's session may see a rise in bean prices between five and 15 cents and a two-cent to three-cent increase in corn prices, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago.    COCOA: Futures prices eased as producing and consuming countries -- members of the International Cocoa Organization meeting in London -- considered a proposal for producers to voluntarily withhold as much as 120,000 metric tons of cocoa from the market. Some analysts question whether a voluntary move would be effective. The March contract fell $28 to $1,866 a metric ton. The voluntary move would follow purchases of 75,000 tons of surplus cocoa by the manager of the group's buffer stock to complete the mandated quantity of 250,000 tons. Conferees are trying to agree on the price at which the manager will buy the final quantity for the buffer stock, an analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
