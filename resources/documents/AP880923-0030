Burma has been rocked in recent months by widespreadpro-democracy protests that have been suppressed ruthlessly thisweek by leaders of a military coup last weekend.   ``In light of the current unsettled political conditions inBurma, we are unable to continue our assistance programs there forthe time being,'' State Department spokesman Rudi Boone saidThursday.   ``Accordingly, we are halting further aid other than emergencyhumanitarian assistance until conditions permit a resumption,'' hesaid, reading from a State Department statement. ``We hope thatthat will be soon and we look forward to renewing cooperation withBurma and the Burmese people.''   Boone said he believed U.S. aid to Burma totaled $12.3 million,but he did not know how much of the aid is for emergencyhumanitarian assistance.   ``Whatever emergency humanitarian assistance there is, there'sprecious little of it,'' said Robert Hathaway, spokesman for Rep.Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairssubcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.   He pegged the total aid to Burma at $14 million.   ``They were authorized almost $7 million in anti-narcotics aidand $7 million in developmental assistance,'' he said, noting thatsince the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, ``I'm not sure how much of(that money) has not yet been expended.''   Hathaway said Solarz, who recently visited Burma en route homefrom Moscow and Beijing, would support the cutoff of aid ``as asymbol of our commitment to the democratic cause and a symbol ofour uneasiness, or worse _ uneasiness really isn't a strong enoughword _ of the course of events of the last few days, in particularthe bloodshed and deaths.''   Months of pro-democracy demonstrations led to the resignation inlate July of Ne Win, who seized power in 1962 and whoseauthoritarian rule turned resource-rich Burma into a land ofpoverty.   Gen. Saw Maung, who became prime minister Wednesday afterleading a military coup Sunday, is the third new leader in twomonths of chaos and bloodshed.   Sein Lwin succeeded Ne Win but lasted for only 17 days ofmassive protests before Maung Maung took over. He was a civilianbut was viewed as close to the military.   Saw Maung, who is closely associated with Ne Win, has pledged tohold elections as soon as peace is restored.   Since the coup, the government has acknowledged security forceskilled at least 146 people, but a Western diplomat has said atleast 400 have been slain, including many unarmed pro-democracydemonstrators.   Opposition leaders sent Saw Maung a letter Thursday urging thegovernment ``not to arrest people including the monks, students,artists, etc., in connection with the recent unrest and also torelease those already under detention.''   Solarz introduced a resolution _ unanimously approved by theHouse on Sept. 7 _ urging democratic change in Burma.   The resolution called for ``the establishment of a transitionalbody, consisting of Burmese citizens who are unquestionablycommitted to democracy and who have the confidence of the Burmesepeople, to organize the holding of multiparty elections andotherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democraticgovernment.''</TEXT></DOC>
