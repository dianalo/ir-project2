Characterization methodology consists of a controlleddepolymerization of a sample coal, solvent extraction of the product,and detailed analysis of the product fractions. For the specific examinationof aliphatic linkages, well-characterized soluble fractions from thesame coal are investigated by a transalkylation reaction. A molecularmodel of the Illinois coal was constructed, and product distributionand a minimum hydrogen requirement in the hydroliquefaction of the coalwere predicted. During the solubilization reactions with NaOH/ethanol/H{sub2}O, ether groups of the coal were hydrolyzed at 260 to 300{degree}C,and phenolic rings in aromatic lusters were hydrolyzed and opened extensivelyat 300 to 320{degree}C, leading to the cleavage of aliphatic linkages.Transalkylation reactions of three soluble fractions from the characterizationwork resulted in high yields of toluene derivatives. Field ionizationmass spectroscopy of toluene derivatives showed a high concentrationof ditolylmethane which was derived from methylene linkages in the feedfractions. Transferred linkages represented only 2.3 to 6.1% of totalalkyl linkages in the fractions. Thus, the transalkylation reaction isineffective for transferring most alkyl groups in the soluble fractions.</TEXT></DOC>
