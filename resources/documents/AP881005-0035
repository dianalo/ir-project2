Supporters called the resolution, which was approved Tuesday ona 408-12 vote, a first step toward ending the legislative hypocrisyfor which critics fault Congress _ passing laws to protect allworkers in the nation except its own.   ``Discrimination is just as wrong in Congress as it is anywhereelse,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, predicted Congress would gofurther in future years to extend to its workers the protectionsoffered in fair labor standards laws and by the Occupational Safetyand Health Act.   The legislation covers only the 12,000 or so employees of theHouse, so it takes effect without further action by the Senate orthe president. And because it is a resolution, not a change in thelaw, it will have to be re-enacted next year to continue in force.   Lawmakers voting against the measure were Reps. Bill Dickinson,R-Ala., Robert Stump, R-Ariz., John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.,Robert Badham, R-Calif., Charles Pashayan, R-Calif., Larry Hopkins,R-Ky., John Dingell, D-Mich., Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., Joseph Gaydos,D-Pa., Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and AlanMollohan, D-W.Va.   Not voting were Reps. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., Buddy MacKay,D-Fla., Connie Mack, R-Fla., Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, Brian Donnelly,D-Mass., Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, Jake Pickle,D-Texas, Beau Boulter, R-Texas, Mack Sweeney, R-Texas, and MikeLowry, D-Wash.   The change, based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sets up aHouse Office of Fair Employment Practices to handle discriminationcomplaints. Court interpretations of the law extend its protectionalso to sexual harassment cases.   The office will investigate discrimination charges and isempowered to mediate cases, determine whether the charges are trueand specify remedies, including job reinstatement or promotion,back pay and monetary compensation. Reprisals against employees whocomplain to the office are prohibited.   Among cases this year that gave impetus to the move:   _Rep. Ernest Konnyu, R-Calif., got into political hot waterafter reports that he made offensive comments to female staffersregarding their physiques. In one case, he suggested that a womanin his office wear high heels instead of flat shoes and instructedher to turn around so he could see how she looked. Konnyu wasdefeated in this year's GOP primary.   _Tom Pappas, the top aide to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., committedsuicide by leaping from a 24th-floor hotel room in New York afterThe Washington Post reported unorthodox social demands he made ofmale aides in Dyson's office.   _Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., came in for criticism followingreports that he made sexually explicit comments to female aides andin some cases embraced them so he would ``feel better.''   Panetta noted that the House has resisted being placed underregular workplace laws because it would put the executive branch inthe position of enforcing laws on Congress, which lawmakers see asan infringement on the constitutional separation of powers.   Panetta said the new rules will let the House police itself. Thenew House procedure would permit lawmakers to continue todiscriminate among employees on the bases of geographical andpolitical preference, so they can choose workers from their homedistricts and of their own parties.</TEXT></DOC>
