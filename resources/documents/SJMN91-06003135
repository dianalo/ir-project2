But unfortunately, in the minds of many, disciplineand order are associated with the use of force.;    &quot;I am not sure thatpresidential rule or any other punitive measures, regardless of where theycome from, can be a means to solve our current problems.&quot;;    Shevardnadzesaid the use of force domestically would endanger the more benign image abroadassociated with the non-belligerent foreign policy referred to here as &quot;newthinking.&quot;;    &quot;In the end it became clear to me that if the destabilizationof the country continues, and the process of democratization is halted, itwill be impossible to follow the current course in foreign policy,&quot; he said.;   &quot;The development of events might lead to a repeat of what happened inTbilisi or Baku,&quot; he said, referring to the use of Soviet troops to suppressnationalist unrest in Georgia and Azerbaijan, with the loss of nearly 150lives. &quot;What new thinking will be worth talking about then?&quot;;   Shevardnadze's resignation has not yet been formally accepted, and nosuccessor has been named. The Soviet parliament session that convenes Tuesdayis expected to consider the issue.;    Although Gorbachev and other officialshave suggested that they would try to keep Shevardnadze in the government, hehas said repeatedly that his decision is final.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BILL KELLER, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910103  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  394  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 3, 199100003135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
