(PRS) is currently operating a CaterpillarG333C, 150 kW spark ignited internal combustion engine on LoBTU gas 4720-7870kJ/Nm/sup 3/ (120-200 Btu/scf) derived from the fluidized bed gasificationof municipal solid waste (MSW). The engine is part of a complete pilotplant, to convert the equivalent of 18 metric tons per day (TPD) of MSWto energy. The data developed in the pilot plant is being used as thedesign basis for a full scale 11.4 MW 385 TPD waste to energy facilitylocated in Derry, NH. This paper describes the combustion of the LoBTUgas in the engine, engine performance, waste heat recovery, and cogenerationapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
