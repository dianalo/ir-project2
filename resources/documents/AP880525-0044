Shultz said.   So far, U.S. and Soviet negotiators have been unable to findways to count the missiles that would be left on both sides ifstockpiles are slashed. This, in turn, keeps the superpowers fromdeciding whether to include mobile missiles in an arms reductiontreaty.   While verification is extremely difficult, the Reaganadministration is not ready to insist on banning the elusiveweapons and give up hope of retaining some of these potentlong-range missiles in the U.S. arsenal, Shultz said Tuesday.   ``They are harder to find, so they are more survivable andtherefore don't invite a first strike,'' Shultz told news agencyreporters in a pre-summit interview. ``So that adds something tostability.''   But he acknowledged their elusiveness poses an extreme problemfor arms control. ``So you have to find a balance, a compromise,''Shultz said.   Negotiations on a new treaty are stymied over the U.S.anti-missile program, known popularly as Star Wars, and oververifying reductions in mobile missiles and cruise missiles carriedon fighter planes and warships.   The treaty is supposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet strategicweapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. At the same time, the twosides want to devise foolproof ways of verifying weapons are notretained illegally.   Shultz said U.S. negotiators in Geneva had already proposed someideas on how to keep track of mobile missiles. At the Moscowsummit, he said, ``We will propose additional ones that refinethings and give them more detail.''   He said the Reagan administration also would pursue at thesummit a system for sending observers to suspect sites with littleadvance warning.   While the treaty cannot be completed in time for the summit,Shultz said there was still a chance of finishing it beforePresident Reagan leaves office next January.   ``It's possible,'' he said. ``I don't know whether it willactually happen or not. There are very knowledgeable people on bothsides working to bring it about. But the problems are verydifficult.''   And yet, he said the Soviets evidently want to keep at it,instead of waiting for the next administration to take over.   ``They are in a negotiating process with people who areknowledgeable, competent, and are engaged,'' Shultz said. ``Sothey, as we, want to make as much progress as is possible.''</TEXT></DOC>
