The campaign is aimed especially at youngsters, mostly boys, whohave turned in increasing numbers to smokeless tobacco products inthe false belief they represent a safer alternative to cigarettes,according to organizers.   The ``Through with Chew Day,'' following seminars on the dangersof smokeless tobacco at schools across the nation, marks the fifthanniversary of the death of Sean Marsee, a star high school athletefrom Ada, Okla. Marsee died at age 19 after a tortuous battleagainst mouth, neck and brain cancers. He had used chewing tobaccoand snuff since he was 12.   At a press briefing, American League President Bobby Brown,himself a physician, joined Marsee's mother, Betty Ann, and a panelof cancer surgeons to announce the new campaign. Brown noted that anestimated 40 to 50 percent of major league ball players use chewingtobacco and vowed renewed efforts to discourage, though not ban, thepractice.   Brown announced the establishment of a group called AthletesThrough With Chew, to be headed by Taxas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan.``Nolan has never used tobacco, and that is the kind of role modelyoung people should have,'' he said.   Brown said he hoped the overall educational campaign, sponsoredby the Academy of Otolaryngology _ Head and Neck Surgery, would swayyoung people to abandon smokeless tobacco products. ``But I'm notsure we can get a dramatic drop among current users in the majorleagues,'' he said. ``The addiction is extremely severe. I have anephew in his early 20s who has tried repeatedly and can't stop.''   Byron J. Bailey, president of the academy, said ``Many youngusers believe smokeless tobacco is a safe alternative to cigarettes,but it actually may be more addictive.''   The academy represents 8,500 physicians specializing in oralcancer and other problems found among users of smokeless tobacco.   According to the National Cancer Institute, snuff and chewingtobacco have regained popularity since the 1970s as the use ofsmoking products waned. Particularly disturbing, says the institute,are indications that many boys are using smokeless products as earlyas age 10, and that 16 percent of all males under age 21 use snuffor chewing tobacco. Fewer than 1 percent of women use the products,the NCI said.   The NCI and the academy attributed the growing rate among boysnot only to the notion that smokeless products are safer thancigarettes, but to   comparatively lower prices and marketing endorsements by``macho'' athletes and other personalities. ``In many schools, it isa status symbol for a boy to have a worn, bleached ring on his backjeans pockete where he carries his snuff can,'' the NCI noted.   The academy, citing NCI surveys, said an estimated 3 millionAmericans under the age of 21 use snuff, which is finely ground orpowdered tobacco, or chewing tobacco, which is more coarsely ground.It said the products can cause cancer of the cheeks, gums andthroat, dicoloration of the teeth, mouth sores, bad breath, anincreased heart rate and high blood pressure.   Michael J. Kerrigan, president of the Smokeless Tobacco Council,an industry group, disputed charges that the industry had promoteduse among young people. Manufacturers ``have for years stressed thatsmokeless tobacco is an adult product,'' he said.   As for health effects, Kerrigan said that ``whether smokelesstobacco causes any human disease, including oral cancer, continuesto be the subject of scientific dispute.''</TEXT></DOC>
