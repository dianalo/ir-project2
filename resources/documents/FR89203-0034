Ch. 313, Subch. II, which is contained in section 102 ofPub. L. 100-710 (enacted November 23, 1988), introduces significant changesthat are at variance with the present law and existing regulations of theMaritime Administration (``MARAD''). For example, the codification expandsthe categories of persons that can be mortgagees of preferred mortgageson documented vessels to include federally insured depository institutions,whether or not the entity is a ``citizen of the United States'' as definedin section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 802). The Secretaryof Transportation (``the Secretary'') is also given broad authority toprescribe criteria for approval of a trustee, without regard to citizenship,for a mortgage held by a noncitizen that cannot qualify as a preferredmortgagee. The codification also removes restrictions on who may hold apreferred mortgage on documented vessels operated only as a fishing vessel,a fish processing vessel, a fish tender vessel or a vessel operated onlyfor pleasure.Pub. L. 100-710 also contains an amendment to section 9 of the ShippingAct, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808), to reflect established administrative andjudicial interpretation of the present law that requires, among other thingsand with new exceptions, the Secretary's approval of transfer to noncitizensof ``control'' of citizen-owned documented vessels. The legislative historyof this amendment further directs that ``the Secretary prescribe guidelinesso there will be a uniform application of policy (as to what constitutes`control') and to advise the public as to the types of transfer for whichthe Secretary has concern.''The provisions of Pub. L. 100-710 that require changes in MARAD's regulationsbecame effective on January 1, 1989. While there is no statutory mandatethat these regulations be in place when the law becomes effective, MARADhas concluded that it is imperative in the interest of all concerned topublish revised regulations as an interim final rule, effective on publication,to permit implementation of the new law without hiatus. This interim finalrule is intended to minimize transitional uncertainty, while allowing subsequentfine-tuning of these regulations based on the opportunity for consideredevaluation of comments from interested parties before adopting a finalrule.Apart from the substantive provisions implementing Pub. L. 100-710, MARADhas taken this opportunity to revise 46 CFR Part 221 in the interest ofa more coherent and orderly statement of its regulatory responsibilitieswith respect to transactions involving citizen-owned documented vessels,including an explanation of certain policy guidelines in response to specificdirections of the Congress contained in the legislative history of Pub.L. 100-710.Whenever reference is made in these regulations to forms prescribed byMARAD for applications or other filing requirements, the format of suchforms in effect prior to the effective date of these regulations may beused pending revision and issuance of new forms approved by The Officeof Management and Budget. To the extent necessary to reflect statutoryrequirements, any form submitted may be modified or supplemented to facilitateprocessing, but until publication of new forms has been approved theseregulations do not require more extensive paperwork or reporting requirementsthan exist under the present MARAD regulations. Indeed, with the exemptionsprovided herein those requirements should be less burdensome in the aggregate.Any additional burden imposed at this time in particular circumstancesis a function of statutory, not regulatory, requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Rulemaking Text</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A Introduction</ITAG>Section 221.1 PurposeSection 221.1, Purpose, is self-explanatory.Section 221.3 DefinitionsSection 221.3, Definitions, is intended to provide convenient referenceto the meaning of significant terminology used in Part 221, based principallyon statutory derivation.Paragraph (a), ``<T3>Charter,</T3>'' identifies arrangements other than conventional charterparties that have been found through past applications to involve sufficientinterest in or control of a documented vessel under 46 App. U.S.C. 808to warrant inclusion in this regulation. These include contracts of affreightment,space charters and leases. Although andSection;221.17(c) of this part providesfor general approval of most charters for periods of six months or less,views are solicited on whether certain contracts of affreightment, spacecharters or leases in excess of six months should be accorded similar treatment.For example, some space charters may allow the use of less than a majorityof a vessel's total capacity. Should such space charters nevertheless requireapproval under 46 App. U.S.C. 808?Some contracts of affreightment provide for transportation of cargo onan as-needed basis, without a named vessel dedicated to the contract. Shouldsuch contracts of affreightment nevertheless require approval under 46App. U.S.C. 808 for the owner's fleet, or only those contracts where identifiedvessels have been dedicated under the contract?Paragraph (b), ``<T3>Citizen of the United States</T3>,'' is derived from 46 App. U.S.C.802, 803, and includes a ``controlling interest'' test not found in thedefinition of ``citizen of the United States'' for purposes of U.S. CoastGuard documentation (46 U.S.C. 2101(3a), 1201).Paragraph (c), ``<T3>Documented vessel,</T3>'' includes a vessel for which a registry hasbeen issued pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 12105, reflecting long-standing interpretationof the documentation laws by the Coast Guard. Also consistent with long-standinginterpretation of those laws by the Coast Guard, a documented vessel retainsthat status, with attendant rights and obligations, until officially removedfrom the documentation rolls. Both interpretations are incorporated intothis definition for purposes of these regulations.Paragraph (d), ``<T3>Federally insured depository institution,</T3>'' implements 46 U.S.C.31322(a)(1)(d)(iii), introducing a new class of authorized mortgagees thatmay or may not be citizens of the United States. Many foreign banking institutionshave noncitizen branches or agencies in the United States. So long as theyare corporations or associations organized and doing business under thelaws of the United States or of a State, are authorized by such law toaccept deposits from the public, and are insured by the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporationor the National Credit Union Administration, those entities are now eligibleto be a mortgagee of preferred mortgages on documented vessel unless disapprovedby MARAD.Paragraph (e), ``<T3>Fishing vessel,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 2101(11a).Paragraph (f), ``<T3>Fish processing vessel,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 2101(11b).Paragraph (g), ``<T3>Fish tender vessel,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 2101(11c).Paragraph (h), ``<T3>Mortgagee,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(1)(d).Paragraph (i), ``<T3>Noncitizen,</T3>'' is the excluded residuum of persons not satisfyingthe definition of ``citizen of the United States'' contained in paragraph(b).Paragraph (j), ``<T3>Person,</T3>'' is derived from section 1 of the Shipping Act, 1916(46 App. U.S.C. 801), modified expressly to include individuals and jointventures and to reflect the fact that ``United States,'' as defined inparagraph (o), already includes the separate geopolitical entities referredto in that statutory definition.Paragraph (k), ``<T3>Person who qualifies as a citizen of the United States under 46 App.U.S.C. 802,</T3>'' reflects long-standing MARAD interpretations of whois a citizen within the meaning of 46 App. U.S.C. 802. In order to be acitizen, a person must not be subject to control by any means whatsoeverby a noncitizen. This definition incorporates the legal principles articulatedin <T3>Mecham Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>207 F.2d 535, 543 (4th Cir., 1953), that the determinationrequires examination beyond the exterior structure of an entity to discoverwho has the actual beneficial interest or control.Paragraph (l), ``<T3>Pleasure vessel,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 2101(25), modifiedto reflect the exclusive use requirement for exemption of such vesselsfrom the authorized mortgagee requirements of 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(1)(D)and from the foreign transfer restrictions of section 9(c)(1) of the ShippingAct, 1916, as contemplated by Pub. L. 100-710. Although Pub. L. 100-710requires exemption solely for ``a vessel operated only for pleasure,''it is believed that the broader definition in this regulation is warrantedin view of the fact that the statutory exemption is predicated upon theuse to which the vessel is put rather than upon ownership by the personusing the vessel. The definition, however, makes clear that a bareboat-charteredpleasure vessel must be under the command of an individual who is a citizenof the United States for the entire charter period, consistent with 46U.S.C. 12110(d).Paragraph (m), ``<T3>State,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 30101(6).Paragraph (n), ``<T3>Trustee,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 31328(a).Paragraph (o), ``<T3>United States,</T3>'' is derived from 46 U.S.C. 30101(8), and has beenincluded to ensure parallelism between use of that term in the codifiedprovisions of the former Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, and its use for purposesof section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916, both as amended by Pub. L. 100-710.Paragraph (p), ``<T3>United States Government,</T3>'' is self-explanatory.Section 221.5 Citizenship DeclarationsSection 221.5, Citizenship Declarations, implements 46 U.S.C. 31306 (a)and (b), <T3>vice </T3>section 40 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 838),repealed. The filing of Form MA-899 with the Coast Guard incident to presentationfor filing or recording of any instrument transferring an interest in adocumented vessel is for the purpose of demonstrating that the transactionis not in violation of section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C.808). This requirement is carried forward from present law and regulations.Section 221.7 Applications and FeesSection 221.7, Applications and Fees, is self-explanatory. The fee amountsare the same as those specified in present 46 CFR 221.14 and 221.16. Thesefees are intended to recover the cost to the government of processing applicationsfor the specified transactions and have not changed for many years. MARADis reviewing the amount of the fees, and they may be adjusted upon publicationof this rule in final form. Comment on this issue is specifically invited.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B, Transfers to Noncitizens or to Registry or Authority ofa Foreign Country Under 46 App. U.S.C. 808</ITAG>Section 221.11 RequiredApprovalsParagraph (a) recites the statutory restrictions on transactions that generallyrequire prior approval of the Maritime Administrator. The statutory exclusionfor certain fishing vessels, fish processing vessels, fish tender vesselsand pleasure vessels is dealt with in andSection;221.15(b)(1), and blanketapprovals for other transactions are contained in andSection;221.17.Paragraph (b) of this section contains a statement of the circumstancesunder which the Maritime Administrator will find that a transaction willresult in a documented vessel being operated ``under the authority of aforeign country.'' This constraint is mandated by the express statutorylanguage of Pub. L. 100-710, but the legislative history provides no guidanceas to its intended scope. The intent of the regulatory definition is toencompass any circumstances under which a documented vessel may be subjectedvoluntarily to requisition, forfeiture, taking or impairment of freedomof navigation in derogation of the rights and obligations of the owner,operator or master under the laws of the United States.Section 221.13 Transfer of ControlThis provision has been included in response to the House Merchant Marineand Fisheries Committee's statement of intent that_<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary prescribe guidelines so there will be a uniform applicationof policy [concerning what constitutes ``control''] and to advise the publicas to the types of transfer for which the Secretary has concern. For example,a privately held corporation in which all of the stock is owned by U.S.citizens may be able to transfer 49 percent of that stock to foreign citizenswithout losing control over the vessel. However, a publicly traded corporation,in which the stock is diluted among many stockholders, may have controltransferred with only a 15 percent stock sale to foreign citizens. Theguidelines prescribed by the Secretary should allow many normal businesstransactions to occur, while placing restrictions on those cases of realconcern. The touchstone of any analysis in this area is who, in fact, exercisescontrol and not the form of how a transaction is structured * * *.</ITAG>H.R. Rept. No. 100-918, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 25 (1988).It is MARAD's intention that this section of the final regulations willcomply fully with that directive, which clearly contemplates concepts of``control'' that may go well beyond the majority equity interest/votingpower/fiduciary obligations that have been the usual indicia. Paragraph(a), <T3>Criteria, </T3>addresses presumptions, both conclusive and rebuttable,in administration of this regulation. Paragraph (a)(1) reiterates indiciathat have been the principal determinates of ``control'' for purposes of46 App. U.S.C. 808 analysis prior to enactment of Pub. L. 100-710. Paragraph(a)(2) suggests new presumptive criteria. For example, under paragraph(a)(2)(i), covenants in loan agreements frequently provide restrictionson the borrower's financial transactions, sale of corporate assets, newbusiness undertakings or abandonment of existing activities, either byprior approval or veto. To the extent such covenants are applicable toor may affect documented vessels owned by the borrower, they could be indiciaof control of the vessels. Other contractual undertakings may give noncitizensan immediate or contingent right to exercise direct authority over operationsof a documented vessel, such as powers contained in a mortgage to an approvednoncitizen mortgagee authorizing, in the event of default, operation ofthe vessel by or on behalf of the noncitizen mortgagee, seizure of physicalpossession and/or sale of the vessel by the mortgagee under a power ofattorney. Implicit in the House Committee's mandate is also the need toconsider criteria of ``control'' that are applied by other Federal agencies,to the extent they may be relevant to a more realistic assessment of ``control''by MARAD for purposes of 46 App. U.S.C. 808, and this is provided for inparagraph (a)(1)(ii). The legislative intent of Pub. L. 100-710 indicatesthat such direct control provisions, if they fall within the noncitizen``control'' restrictions of 46 App. U.S.C. 808, would require explicitMARAD approval even though the noncitizen might hold a preferred mortgageon that vessel.Paragraph (a)(3), attributing transfer to or acquisition of control toa noncitizen if a parent or person that directly or indirectly controlsthe transferee or acquiring person is a noncitizen, is consistent withpresent MARAD policy.Paragraph (b), <T3>Voting Interest,</T3> addresses, <T3>inter alia,</T3> the subject of convertible non-voting instruments,which has also been included in response to the House Committee's mandatethat MARAD explicate policy guidelines concerning its approach to ``control''determinations for purposes of 46 App. U.S.C. 808, as amended by Pub. L.100-710.Notwithstanding the foregoing, and mindful of the House Committee's injunctionthat the guidelines should not unnecessarily intrude on ``normal businesstransactions'' that are not ``of real concern,'' the Maritime Administrationdoes not intend to depart significantly at this time from the jurisdictionalprecedents under 46 App. U.S.C. 808 that are well-known to the maritimeand financial communities, absent extenuating circumstances, until suchtime as the there has been full opportunity for interested persons to expresstheir views on precisely what would accommodate the Committee's invitationfor a more expansive view of ``control'' in ``cases of real concern'' without,perforce, more intrusive interference with legitimate business transactions.Section 221.15 Unrestricted Transfers Paragraph (a) reflects the statutory exclusion from MARAD approval of transactionsunder 46 App. U.S.C. 808 if the owner of a documented vessel is not a citizenof the United States within the meaning of 46 App. U.S.C. 802.Paragraph (b) implements the conditional statutory exemption from priorapproval by MARAD for transfer to noncitizens of vessels that have beenoperated only as a fishing vessel, fish processing vessel, fish tendervessel or vessels that have been operated only for pleasure. Statutoryuse of the restrictive language, ``have been operated only,'' bespeaksan intent that there have been a continuum of exclusive use of vessel forone or more of the designated purpose for the exemption to be applicable.Accordingly, this paragraph reflects this stringent test, but makes provisionfor the fact that vessels can be converted or adapted from prior non-qualifyinguse to a qualifying use and allows exclusion of such vessels so long asthey have been exclusively operated with <T3>bona fides </T3>for any of the qualifying uses for a period of notless than twelve (12) consecutive months prior to the date of transfer.Nevertheless, in either event, exclusive use is a requisite for the exemption.Many documented vessels that operate in the geographic ambit of the coastwisetrade hold dual or multiple licenses or endorsements. For example, fishtender vessels holding a fisheries license or endorsed registry may alsohold a coastwise license or endorsed registry for transport of commercialor proprietary cargo between points in the United States as an adjunctto primary usage of the vessels. Since the clear statutory exclusion appliessolely to vessels that <T3>have been operated only </T3>as a fish tender vessel, the exclusionwould not apply to such a vessel if it has also been operated for otherpurposes under the coastwise license or endorsed registry. Accordingly, paragraph (c) conditions availability of the exemptions ofthis section on filing of Form MA-899 with the Coast Guard accompanyingsurrender for the certificate of documentation or registry, as requiredby law. Section 221.17 General Approval In paragraph (a), <T3>All Transactions, </T3>MARAD grants administrative approval for alltransactions with respect to certain categories of vessels that, underthe 46 App. U.S.C. 808 transfer-of-control authority, would not otherwisebe exempt by statute from the approval requirements. MARAD is grantinggeneral approval relating to such transfers because, at the present time,there is deemed to be insufficient national interest to require prior MARADapproval for transactions, other than those excluded in the preamble, involvingdocumented vessels that are: (1) Self-propelled vessels under 1,000 grosstons; (2) vessels located on inland lakes or waters from which there isno navigable exit; and (3) non-self-propelled vessels under 1,000 grosstons, other than LASH and SEABEE barges. Any noncitizen acquiring a vessel,or an interest in or control of, a vessel pursuant to this general exemptionwould, perforce, be precluded from using that vessel in the coastwise trade.However, a ``Bowaters'' corporation has, by special legislation (46 App.U.S.C. 883-1), a limited waiver, for proprietary carriage, of the JonesAct requirement that coastwise privileges are available only to a vesselowned by a person who qualifies as a citizen of the United States under46 App. U.S.C. 802. Because ``Bowaters'' corporations have that dispensationfor access to the Jones Act trade, MARAD is of the view that any acquisitionof vessels or interests in or control of vessels by such corporations (otherthan by purchase, as permitted by this special legislation) should be subjectto regulatory scrutiny to ensure conformity with the limited operationalpurpose and intent of the statute. Accordingly, the preamble to this paragraphexcepts ``Bowaters'' corporations from the general exemption from 46 App.U.S.C. 808 approval for transactions involving the stated categories ofvessels. In paragraph (b), <T3>Mortgages, </T3>blanket approval is given for mortgages to noncitizensunder certain circumstances. Paragraph (b)(1) grants approval for mortgagesof documented vessels to noncitizen federally insured depository institutionsthat have complied with the requirements of andSection; 221.45(a) of thispart, in accordance with 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(1)(D)(iii). Paragraph (b)(2) grants approval for mortgages to any noncitizen of vesselsspecified in andSection;221.17(a) of this part. In paragraph (c), <T3>Charters, </T3>MARAD's present policy concerning charters generallyis reiterated. Paragraph (d), <T3>Charters for Trade with the USSR, </T3>reiterates present policy concerningcharters by a citizen of the United States to a noncitizen for trade withthe USSR and is carried forward with no intended change. Section 221.19 Prohibited Transactions Section 221.19, Prohibited Transaction, replicates the restrictions underpresent MARAD regulations concerning transactions with nationals of interdictedforeign political entities. Section 221.21 Requests for Waiver of Required Documentation or Approvalof Use Paragraph (a) implements 46 U.S.C. 31329(a), which permits foreclosuresale of a documented vessel by order of a district court to a person eligibleto own a documented vessel or to a mortgagee of the vessel. The statutealso provides that a purchaser of the vessel, pursuant to order of a districtcourt or from an intervening noncitizen mortgagee-purchaser, must documentthe vessel under the laws of the United States, unless that requirementis waived by MARAD. Although decisions concerning documentation of vesselsis a Coast Guard function, MARAD has responsibility under 46 App. U.S.C.808 for regulating the transfer of documented vessels to noncitizens orto foreign registry or authority. Since 46 U.S.C. 31329 contemplates thata vessel sold by order of a district court will continue to be operatedand documented only under the laws of the United States, a requirementfor express administrative permission for departure from that legislativeintent is within the ambit of MARAD's statutory responsibilities. Paragraph (b) provides that in order to be considered for a waiver, a writtenrequest must be submitted to MARAD. Such request must contain the presentand former name(s) and official number of the vessel; present and formerowner(s) of the vessel; vessel type; vessel gross tonnage; and the intendedcountry of registry. Paragraph (c) implements 46 U.S.C. 31329(b)(1) and (c). If the purchaser-mortgageeat the court-ordered sale is not eligible to document the vessel, the vesselmust be held for resale only and may be operated by the mortgagee onlywith MARAD approval. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C, Preferred Mortgages on Doncumented Vessels: Mortgageesand Trustees </ITAG>Section 221.41 Purpose Section 221.41, Purpose, is self-explanatory. Section 221.43 General Approval of Mortgagees Section 221.43, General Approval of Mortgagees, reflects exercise by theMaritime Administrator of the discretion contained in new 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(1)(D)(vi)to approve persons other than those specifically identified in the statuteto be mortgagees of preferred mortgages on documented vessels. In paragraph (a)(1), blanket approval is granted to certain federally insureddepository institutions to hold preferred mortgages on documented vessels,pursuant to authority of 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(1)(D)(iii), notwithstandingthat they are not citizens of the United States. The statute authorizessuch institutions to be mortgagees, unless disapproved. For purposes ofthese interim final regulations MARAD has determined that the appropriatecriteria for regulatory approval of a noncitizen federally insured depositoryinstitution as a mortgagee should be the same as those for statutory qualificationof an institutional trustee, except for (1) the requirement that the institutionhave trust powers and (2) the option between supervision or examinationby a State, rather than a Federal, official, as established in an applicationevidencing compliance with the requisite criteria. Relief from the generaldisapproval of such institutions in paragraph (a)(2) will be granted onlyupon receipt of an application pursuant to paragraph (a)(1). This is newground, and should be tilled cautiously at the outset. Paragraph (b)(1) provides general approval for noncitizens to be mortgageesof vessels that are exempt from foreign transfer restrictions under theseregulations: However, Paragraph (b)(2) limits this approval to mortgagesthat contain no provisions allowing noncitizens to operate the vessel withoutMARAD's approval, or to exercise control over the owner, charterer or managementof the vessel. The term ``control'' is defined to mean the ability, presentor prospective, through any means or device whatsoever, to influence inany manner business decisions affecting the vessel. Notwithstanding the general approvals granted in paragraphs (a) and (b),paragraph (c) states that they are inapplicable where the mortgagee hasdirect or indirect ties to certain interdicted countries. Section 221.45 Permitted Mortgages and Trusts Paragraph (a) provides that where the United States Government or a Stateis the mortgagee of a documented vessel or trustee for the benefit of aperson not qualifying as a citizen of the United States, issuance of thenote or other evidence of indebtedness secured by the mortgage does notrequire MARAD approval. Paragraph (b) makes clear that, unless a person is a mortgagee or trusteeapproved by MARAD, a note or other evidence of indebtedness secured bya mortgage on a documented vessel may not be issued, assigned, transferredto, or held in trust for the benefit of a noncitizen, by that person toa person who does not qualify as a citizen of the United States under 46App. U.S.C. 802 without specific approval of MARAD. Paragraph (c) provides that if the approval of a mortgagee or trustee lapseswhile the mortgage or trust is in effect, the former mortgagee or trusteeis liable for curing the lapse by timely substitution of a successor withMARAD approval. Section 221.47 Approval of Corporate Citizen Trustee Section 221.47, Approval of Corporate Citizen Trustee, reflects the statutorycriteria of 46 U.S.C. 31328(b)(1)-(4) for approval of a corporate trusteethat is a citizen of the United States. Section 221.49 Approval of Noncorporate Citizen Trustee Section 221.49, Approval of Noncorporate Citizen Trustee, adapts the criteriaof 46 App. U.S.C. 31328(b)(1)-(4) to noncorporate business entities thatare citizens of the United States. Section 221.51 Approval of Noncitizen Trustee Paragraphs (a) and (b) implement 46 U.S.C. 31328 (a)(4) and (b)(5) to permita federally insured depository institution that is not a citizen of theUnited States to serve as an approved trustee if it otherwise meets thecriteria of 46 U.S.C. 31328(b)(1)-(4) either as a corporation or an associationand files an application to that effect with MARAD. Paragraph (c), consistent with the exclusion of fishing vessels, fish processingvessels, fish tender vessels and pleasure vessels from the restrictionson who may hold a preferred mortgage under 46 U.S.C. 31322(a)(2), grantsapproval for any noncitizen, other than an individual, to serve as a trusteeof such mortgages. Paragraph (d) provides that all other noncitizens, including a noncitizenfederally insured depository institution that has not submitted the requisiteapplication, are excluded from the general approval granted under thissection, but may be considered for approval upon application to the MaritimeAdministrator. Section 221.53 Application for Approval as Mortgagee or Trustee Section 221.53, Application for Approval as Mortgagee or Trustee, establishesthe procedure for such applications. General approvals of mortgagees ortrustees are confirmed for one year, subject to annual renewal pursuantto andSection; 221.55, and a list of such generally approved mortgagees andtrustees will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> from time to time. Specific approval of a mortgageeor trustee for a particular transaction is, of course, valid for the periodstated in the approval. Section 221.55 Renewal of General Approval as Mortgagee or Trustee Section 221.55, Renewal of General Approval as Mortgagee or Trustee, isself-explanatory. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart D, Transactions Involving Maritime Interests in Time of Waror National Emergency Under 46 App. U.S.C. 835 </ITAG>This Subpart reserves for later implementation regulations concerning foreigntransfer of interests in or control of vessels or maritime facilities underthe captioned circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart E, Penalties</ITAG>This subpart will be published as part of the final rule.

It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.While this rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmentalpolicies, it is considered significant because it implements statutorychanges that will substantially effect the regulation of transactions involvingU.S.-documented vessels, and may be expected to generate significant publicinterest. However, because the economic impact should be minimal, furtherregulatory evaluation is not necessary. Moreover, the Maritime Administratorcertifies that this amendment will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.This rulemaking does not significantly affect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.Finally, this rulemaking contains reporting requirements that either havepreviously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (ApprovalNo. 2133-0006), or are being submitted for its approval, pursuant to provisionof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Use of present Maritime Administration forms will becontinued pending approval of proposed revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 221</ITAG>Maritime administration, Maritime carriers.Accordingly, 46 CFR Part 221 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 221_REGULATED TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING DOCUMENTED VESSELS AND OTHERMARITIME INTERESTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.5 Citizenship declarations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.7 Applications and fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart B_Transfers to Noncitizens or to Registry or Authority ofa Foreign Country Under 46 App. U.S.C. 808</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.11 Required approvals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.13 Transfer of control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.15 Unrestricted transfers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.17 General approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.19 Prohibited transactions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.21 Requests for waiver of required documentation or approval ofuse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart C_Preferred Mortgages on Documented Vessels: Mortgagees andTrustees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.41 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.43 General approval of mortgages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.45 Permitted mortgages and trusts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.47 Approval of corporate citizen trustee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.49 Approval of noncorporate citizen trustee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.51 Approval of noncitizen trustee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.53 Application for approval as mortgagee or trustee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.55 Renewal of general approval as mortgagee or trustee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart D_Transactions Involving Maritime Interests in Time of Waror National Emergency Under 46 App. U.S.C. 835 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Penalties [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Other Transfers Involving Documented Vessels</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">221.90 Uniform Bareboat Charter of a Government-owned dry-cargo vesselunder section 705 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, ``FormNo. 705.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix_to Part 221.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Secs. 2, 9, 37, 41 and 43, Shipping Act, 1916, as amended,and Secs. 204(b) and 705, Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App.U.S.C. 705, 802, 803, 808, 835, 839, 841a, 11149(b), 1195); 49 CFR 1.66.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 221.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>This part implements statutory responsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation(the ``Secretary'') with respect to:(a) Approval of mortgagees and trustees of preferred mortgages on vesselsdocumented under the laws of the United States pursuant to 46 U.S.C. ch.313, subch.
