(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A gunman who surrenderedto park rangers after releasing eight hostages from a visitors'center will undergo a psychiatric examination, authorities said.   The man, identified as Brett Hartley of Baton Rouge, La., wastaken into custody Friday night and transported to Jackson, Wyo.,where he will be tested.   ``He is a frustrated guy who has had a hard life,'' said parkranger Joe Evans, noting that Hartley once suffered from cancer.``He was relatively calm the whole time.''   The hostage-taking ``was an expression of asking for help. Somepeople have a hard time asking for help,'' Evans said.   Park spokesman Shelton Johnson said Hartley, 18, walked into thecenter at Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful geyser complexshortly after 3 p.m. Friday, brandished a Ruger .30-caliber revolverand told everyone inside to lie down.   Women and children who were visiting were released a few minuteslater, but Hartley held eight hostages about three hours, Johnsonsaid. The hostages included five male visitors and three parkemployees, two of whom were women.   Gary Painter, 34, of West Jordan, Utah, one of the hostages heldfor three hours, said the center was silent inside except for thesound of Hartley talking on the telephone with park rangers.   ``I was just lying there on the floor watching him,'' Paintersaid. ``I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen. Hedidn't say a word (to us). He never said anything about why. He wasreal calm.''   Suddenly, at 6 p.m., Hartley yelled an obscenity into thetelephone and told everyone to leave, Painter said. The hostages ranout the door.   No one was injured and no shots were fired, park authorities said.   Park ranger Bundy Phillips said he conducted the telephonenegotiations for nearly five hours with Hartley, who had a guntrained on the hostages throughout much of the period.   Phillips said Hartley told him he planned the incident, and that``it was a choice between the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.''   Evans said Hartley put the gun down about 8 p.m. and walkedoutside the center, where he was met by three park rangers in a car.After a short conversation, he was handcuffed and placed in the car,Evans said.   President Bush and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan are scheduledto visit Yellowstone on Monday to inspect damage from last summer'sforest fires. The center is not in an area the president planned tovisit.</TEXT></DOC>
