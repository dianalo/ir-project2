The madmen are his friends -- his campaign staff.    &quot;Your schedule is made by a bunch of maniacs,&quot; says Arizona Rep. Udall, recalling his losing 1976 Democratic nomination bid against Jimmy Carter. &quot;Some work for you, some work for other candidates and some work for causes. You fly all over the country -- to San Antonio, to Detroit, to Seattle -- just to make the evening news. You don't call your own shots.&quot;    These reflections from one of the most balanced and rounded human beings to run for president in modern times suggest what Americans have done to their presidential selection process. Think of it in Darwinian terms -- the survival of the fittest and all that.    Since the 1968 election, we have reshaped our whole political environment, and a new kind of political animal is evolving to suit it. &quot;What we have now is the survival of the most enthusiastic and the most extreme,&quot; sums up Rep. Bill Frenzel, a thoughtful Minnesota Republican.    It's not a pretty picture. Presidential politics, like stock market investing, is rapidly becoming a game that only professionals can play. Presidential campaigning has become almost continuous, an occupation in itself, like plumbing or dentistry. Candidates travel behind flying wedges of professional image makers and pulse takers. And they appeal, in overemphasized states like Iowa and New Hampshire, to citizens who amount to professional caucus goers and primary voters.    It's an awesome technical spectacle. But the poetry is draining away.    What we have today is a political world increasingly dominated by specialists: astute, earnest, focused -- and narrow. What comes to mind is Evelyn Waugh's description of a character in &quot;Brideshead Revisited,&quot; the calculating and acquisitive Rex Mottram: &quot;He isn't a real person at all; he's just a few faculties of a man highly developed.&quot;    The result is a campaign process that, for all its feverish activity, often seems eerily detached from the real world.    &quot;There's no war here,&quot; commented bemused GOP strategist John Sears last summer, looking out over a battlefield clogged with candidates groping for campaign themes. &quot;There's just a lot of people in uniforms.&quot;    &quot;Politics is like sports now,&quot; ventures Todd Domke, a Massachusetts-based political consultant. &quot;The whole thing takes place in a kind of artificially constructed arena.&quot;    Consultants themselves have helped build that arena. Consider, for instance, the work of Populus Inc., a consulting concern in Greenwich, Conn. Populus tests campaign commercials and candidate speeches by recruiting ordinary human beings to watch them. The audience pushes buttons on little boxes to record whatever emotions they're feeling.    It all goes into a computer. Zero defects! Zero surprises! That's what Populus is after.    The press, of course, has to shoulder part of the blame. We're players in the process now, and we've done our share to drain the mystery out of it.    &quot;We live in an age without secrets,&quot; observes political consultant Robert Goodman. &quot;We come to know each other too well.&quot; That's what happened to Gary Hart and Joseph Biden. We came to know them too well.    There are reasons the system is the way it is, of course. Party organization and political bosses are extinct; we've substituted political technicians and television advertising for them. Once the bosses winnowed down candidates in the back room. Now we winnow them down in public, in campaign by ordeal.    Would any of the the presidential giants of the past have survived today's nomination gantlet? You have to doubt it. Thomas Jefferson? No way. (Allegations of an affair with a slave girl.) Abraham Lincoln? Not a chance. (Brooding, melancholy, looks emaciated on television.) Woodrow Wilson? Are you kidding? (A horse face atop a stuffed shirt.) Franklin D. Roosevelt? Not likely. (What about his health? The guy's in a wheelchair.)    None of this means that today's system is incapable of producing a giant of its own. Presidents do grow -- and sometimes shrink -- in office. Columnist Walter Lippmann, the sage of his day, dismissed FDR before his election as &quot;a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.&quot;    Nor is today's system all bad. &quot;For all its faults, it's uniquely democratic, with a small 'd,'&quot; says Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank. &quot;It's kind of hard to imagine Francois Mitterrand in New Hampshire.&quot;    Eddie Mahe, a respected GOP consultant in Washington, sees a certain value in prolonged campaigns conducted amid press scrutiny. &quot;Over time, honesty catches up with these candidates,&quot; he says. &quot;Reality catches up with them.&quot;    We can tinker with the system, and we probably should. &quot;Shoot anybody who takes a straw poll,&quot; suggests Barney Frank. Or have regional primaries. But no amount of tinkering will really change today's political environment or the kind of candidate evolving from it.    We are standardizing our presidential candidates, just as surely as we have standardized supermarket tomatoes. There remain conspicuous exceptions, of course. But is it any accident that Richard Gephardt, Al Gore and Jack Kemp all look like anchormen on our nightly news? Or that Michael Dukakis and Pat Robertson actually have been television moderators?    Probably not. A new political species is gradually emerging -- smoother, blander, less a product of the world than a product of the electoral system itself. It is a different type from Dwight D. Eisenhower, a man essentially shaped outside the political process, or Harry S. Truman, the scrappy little haberdasher who would tell anyone to go to hell.    The new species may give us what we want. It may even give us what we need. But something is slowly being lost -- a rough-edged authenticity, an aura -- and it's not likely to come back.    ---   Mr. Farney is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter based in Kansas City, Mo. </TEXT></DOC>
