Bork contends that the body of decisions by the current Supreme Court term has not represented a reversal of past protections of the rights of minorities, but only &quot;moderate and overdue adjustments to legal doctrine in the field of civil rights law.&quot; He then dismisses criticism of these decisions, which he sees as arising from the erroneous assumption &quot;that the court's function is to replace law with moral passion, even if that moral passion produces dubious results.&quot; In his opinion, the president and Congress should undertake no action to undo these decisions, since they are &quot;clearly correct,&quot; and the court should resist &quot;moral intimidation&quot; and stand by its positions.    Mr. Bork's is an eminently logical position, but one that would be more believable if he were not simultaneously criticizing the Supreme Court for choosing law over passion in the flag-burning decision. To what, save moral passion, was President Bush appealing in his appearance at the Iwo Jima monument? Was it concern for the law that caused the House of Representatives to stay in session all night for emotional, if unheard, speeches? Could the vocal and angry public outcries constitute anything but attempted moral intimidation in its most basic form?    The proposed constitutional amendment would be a dubious result indeed. It would attempt to protect the symbol of our freedoms by abridging, however slightly, the most basic of these freedoms. Its use of the term &quot;desecration&quot; is not only imprecise, but also hints at the establishment of a state religion. Mr. Bork's opinion in this matter clearly puts him not among conservative advocates of the rule of law, such as Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, but rather among the activists of moral passion such as Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who joked that he would rather celebrate the anniversary of the Alien and Sedition Acts than that of the Bill of Rights. One shudders to imagine what other &quot;adjustments to legal doctrine&quot; might have come about with a Justice Bork on the Supreme Court.    Martin E. Cobern    Cheshire, Conn.    ---Congratulations to Mr. Bork for his excellent article. One issue that is ignored in the affirmative-action debate is the right of the consumer to the best possible products and services. The typical minority member is not a government employee or an independent contractor. He is most certainly a consumer, a taxpayer and a recipient of government services ranging from fire and police protection to national defense. In what way is the average minority citizen better off when a less qualified person is hired to teach, manage or pave a highway?    I would ask those who support affirmative action to imagine this. It's a cold rainy night and you have been injured seriously in an automobile accident. In walks the doctor who will try to save your life. Do you want the most qualified doctor, or do you want a doctor who has been selected to offset possible past discrimination?    Rice P. York Jr.    Jackson, Miss.    ---   Mr. Bork states, &quot;All the Supreme Court has held is that discrimination must be proved rather than assumed. Only to those who think America pervasively and incurably racist does that seem outrageous.&quot; But the doctrine that America is pervasively racist is being taught in colleges and universities across the country. Even when not explicitly proclaimed in the minority-studies courses and sensitivity seminars that are the fashion to require of all undergraduates, it is the premise on which such requirements are based and it is, therefore, taught, all the more effectively, by implication. Thus has higher education lent itself to dubious political purposes, at the expense of its rightful mission.
