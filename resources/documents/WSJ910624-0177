Analysts who have seen the new CADDS 5 product, Prime'sfirst total rewrite of the software in a decade, say itbrings the company close to technical leadership in mostaspects of CAD/CAM, which stands for computer aideddesign/computer aided manufacturing.</LP><TEXT>   Prime, like other computer makers, is pushing to get moreof its revenue from software products. Computervision Corp.,which Prime acquired in 1988, pioneered the CAD/CAM businessin the 1970s but has slipped to third place in the $7.7billion market behind International Business Machines Corp.and Intergraph Corp., Huntsville, Ala. CAD/CAM is used byautomakers, aerospace firms, architects and engineers todesign machines, buildings and plants.   Jack Shields, president and chief executive officer, saidthat while sales of Prime's computers will continue todecline, software sales will pick up the slack. The result inthe next few years will be that revenue would &quot;remain thesame with much improved profit margins,&quot; he said.   Last year, Prime's revenue grew 4.7% to $1.59 billion andPrime reported an operating profit of $82.2 million beforeinterest, depreciation and other costs related to itsleveraged buy-out. But in the first quarter ended March 31,revenue fell 8.1% and it had an operating loss of $11.8million. Prime is owned by DR Holdings, a unit of J.H.Whitney andamp; Co., a New York venture capital firm.   The new CADDS 5 is coming just in time, analysts said.&quot;Everyone has been writing off Prime as one of thedinosaurs,&quot; said Gisela Wilson, CAD/CAM analyst at marketresearcher International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. &quot;Nowthey've introduced a modernized product with a wonderfulinterface. It will change the dynamics of the market.&quot;   CADDS 5 will be sold as a single software package for$24,500. In a departure from past practice, Prime will alsosell pieces of the software as individual packages, making itdirectly competitive with a host of smaller CAD/CAMdevelopers. CADDS 5 runs on Sun Microsystems Inc.workstations, which customers can buy from Prime or othersuppliers.   Prime will also sell CADDS 5 through independent resellersfor the first time. CADDS 5 is being tested now at a fewcompanies and will go on sale in the fall.   Charles Foundyller, president of Daratech Inc., aCambridge, Mass., firm that follows the industry, said CADDS5 &quot;brings together the best-of-breed tools in all theimportant mechanical design areas.&quot;   He predicted that a new CADDS capability for parametricmodeling, which allows engineers to quickly sketch and altermechanical parts, will especially hurt business for fastgrowing Parametric Technology Corp., Waltham, Mass. &quot;Untilthis is released it will freeze in their tracks anyoneconsidering going to Parametric.&quot; He also said the newproduct is likely to prevent further defections fromComputervision's big customer base. Parametric officialsdidn't return phone calls.   Ms. Wilson of International Data predicted that by sellingindividual software packages at low prices, Computervisioncan even blunt the momentum of &quot;Autodesk which has beeneating their lunch at the low end.&quot; Autodesk Inc., Sausalito,Calif., makes AutoCad software which dominates the personalcomputer end of the market.   Don McInnis, Prime vice president and general manager ofthe CAD business, said that the CAD/CAM business world-wideis growing only 10% this year, far below earlier projectionsof 15%. he predicted that with CADDS 5, Prime will &quot;pick up acouple of points of market share.&quot; Daratech estimates thatComputervision had a 13.7% market share last year, whileIntergraph had 16.3% and IBM had 30.3%.</TEXT></DOC>
