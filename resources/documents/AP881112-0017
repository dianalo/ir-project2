Earlier Friday, communist authorities held their most elaborateceremonies to celebrate the re-establishment of Poland in 1918, whenanti-Soviet leader Jozef Pilsudski took power at the end of WorldWar I.   Opposition groups organized independent marches and rallies inthe cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow, Wroclaw, Lublin, Lodz, Poznan,Tarnow and Katowice.   But the official news agency PAP complained that protests inseveral cities caused a ``dissonance in the patriotic atmosphere.... In some cities, there were demonstrations and attempts todisturb public order undertaken by irresponsible groups of youth,''it said.   Reporters watched police fire tear gas and then charge about 500young people near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw afterdemonstrators threw sticks at officers. The protesters quicklyscattered into a nearby park, but at least 10 were detained.   The skirmish followed a torchlight march by more than 20,000Poles chanting ``Solidarity'' and ``Independence'' in the streets ofthe capital following a Mass marking the anniversary.   An opposition spokeswoman in Gdansk said 25,000 people attended aMass in St. Mary's Basilica Catholic church, the country's largestchurch. Afterward many tried to march but were attacked by police infull riot gear who fired water cannon and beat demonstrators withbatons.   Referring to plans to shut down the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk,birthplace of the banned Solidarity union, spokeswoman JoannaWojciechowska said the crowd chanted defiantly: ``Lenin is yours,the shipyard is ours.''   The turmoil ended after Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski appealed to thepolice commander to call off his troops and let the mainly youthfulprotesters disperse unattacked, she said.   In western Poznan city, a two-hour battle erupted between riotpolice and 4,000 shouting, leaflet-throwing demonstrators, saidAlexandra Bessert, a Solidarity activist. She said scores of peoplewere detained.   Three people were hospitalized after being beaten by police inthe southern industrial city of Katowice, said Maria Moczulska, aspokeswoman for the Confederation for an Independent Poland. Policealso intervened after a Mass in Tarnow, opposition spokesmen said.   People gathered peacefuly in Lodz, Wroclaw, Lublin and othersmaller cities, opposition spokesmen said.   But after the main rally attended by 10,000 people in Krakow,small groups of youth reportedly clashed with police after theydecided to march on the Soviet consulate.   The Warsaw crowd packed St. John's Cathedral in the Old Town,where Warsaw Bishop Wladyslaw Miziolek told worshipers: ``Theindependence of Poland is the concern of every generation.''   After a Mass led by boy scouts, the crowd marched down a historicstreet past the restored Royal Castle to lay flowers at the Tomb ofthe Unknown Soldier.   The popular demonstrations followed a day of gala celebrationssponsored by Polish officials, including a rare televised Mass andlegions of goose-stepping soldiers in a military parade.   It was the first time so much attention was paid to Pilsudski,who in 1918 had just been released from a German prison at the endof World War I.   On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in Warsaw turned over militarypower to Pilsudski, who proclaimed an independent Polish state anddisarmed German troops in the capital.   The dream of generations of patriots was realized with there-establishment of Poland after 123 years of being partitionedbetween Prussia, Austria and Russia. Nov. 11 was celebrated asindependence day before World War II but was spurned by communistauthorities after the war.   Official attitudes toward the date have softened in the aftermathof the 1981 declaration of martial law, with the military governmentembracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name ofthe ``Ojczyzna,'' the fatherland.   On Victory Square, Polish Communist Party leader Gen. WojciechJaruzelski, wearing his army uniform and flanked by Prime MinisterMieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided at the hourlong official ceremonies.</TEXT></DOC>
