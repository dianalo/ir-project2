SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five congressmen put a trio of leading judgeson notice: the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges maywell depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work.   ``Pay raises should be reserved for those who work,'' said Rep.Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House courtssubcommittee.   His message was echoed by four Republican and Democraticcolleagues at a hearing Thursday. They were taken aback bytestimony from the judicial leaders, who are seeking a 30 percentpay raise for all federal judges.   U.S. Circuit Judge Frank Coffin depicted a federal benchdemoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier thisyear, but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response tocomplaints over pay that members of Congress hear when they go hometo the voters.   ``I have never seen so many judges at all levels, in all courts,and in all parts of the country so disheartened as I do today,''Coffin said. ``Ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark andominous silhouettes that the term implies.''   He called Feb. 7, the day Congress defeated the pay raise,``Black Tuesday.''   But Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., replied, ``Many voters in mydistrict do not regard it as Black Tuesday, and I'm one of them.''   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said, ``One catalyst for thatdefeat was the front page story in most of the nation's newspapersthat former Chief Justice Warren Burger'' and other senior judgeswho do no judicial work would get the raise.   He said he went to four town meetings in his district at thattime ``and I heard about that 50 times if I heard about it once.''   Then he offered the three judges what he called ``a little bitof friendly advice: the senior judge situation must be resolved ifyou want a pay raise. ... And I've not seen much in the way ofconstructive suggestions from you.''   Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill., said he too was peppered withobjections at town meetings after the news stories.   ``I was faced with the Burger question,'' Sangmeister said.``And I was not able to defend that.''   Earlier this year, The Associated Press reported previouslyunpublished federal figures from 1987 that showed that 20 percentof 306 senior federal judges did no judicial work. These includeBurger, who since he stepped down has spent his time chairing thecelebration of the bicentennials of the Constitution and Bill ofRights.   An Associated Press survey of all senior judges in February andMarch of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges didno judicial work. The AP survey credited judges for dormant casesstill on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not.   Coffin and his colleagues told the subcommittee it would beunfair to deprive non-working senior judges of pay raises by, asCoffin put it, ``suddenly changing the rules after a lifetime.'' Hesaid only three of the non-working seniors were under age 70; 16were in their 70s, 20 in their 80s, two in their 90s and two intheir 100s.   Kastenmeier asked whether these non-working senior judgesshouldn't go into full retirement.   Kastenmeier and the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep.Carlos Moorhead of California, introduced a bill earlier this monthto require that senior judges carry a 25 percent workload toqualify for raises. Those senior judges who did less work would gettheir last full salary and cost-of-living increases, but no raisesabove that.   At the hearing, Kastenmeier announced that he and Moorhead hadagreed to the judges' request to introduce in Congress a 30 percentpay raise and annual cost-of-living increases for judges.   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent pay raise for judges. A51 percent raise tied to equal increases for Congress and topexecutive branch officials died earlier this year in the face ofpublic uproar.   Currently, judges who reach 65 with 15 years experience canresign and keep for life the full salary on their last day of work.They get no cost-of-living increases but are allowed to resume theprivate practice of law. Currently, 14 have done this.   Alternatively, at that age and experience, federal judges mayopt for senior status and do as much or as little work as theylike. These senior judges still pick up all the pay raises given toactive judges, and like active judges they can't have private lawpractices. The number of judges in this category hovers near 300.There are about 700 active judges.</TEXT></DOC>
