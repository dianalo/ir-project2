Gomard Olayan, 30, released five of the hostages, including apolice officer, and the sixth escaped 10 minutes after a tear gascannister started a fire in a second-floor apartment in the Honolulusuburb of Waipahu.   Police said it was not immediately clear whether Olayan died inthe fire, during the gunfight or by his own hand. He was armed witha Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle, authorities said.   Olayan fired at least seven bursts of three shots each during thestandoff, said Sgt. Mike Kaainoa. No one was injured by the bullets,police said.   The standoff came to a head at 9:25 a.m. with a rapid exchange ofgunfire between Olayan and police. Police then fired tear gas intothe apartment.   Police decided to open fire because Olayan had been shootingsporadically out of the apartment throughout the morning, said Maj.Robert Au, head of the detective division.   ``We were afraid that some of these shots might injure someone inthe community,'' Au said.   Olayan and 26-year-old Roy Frisbee escaped from the OahuCommunity Correctional Cetner on Thursday night by taking two guardshostage with a handgun. Frisbee remained at large Saturday, policesaid.   Both escapees were awaiting trial on numerous charges, includingthe illegal possession of firearms and terroristic threatening,police said.   Police said Olayan took three children and an adult hostagearound 10 p.m. Friday night. Police said the adult hostage wasDennis Busano, Olayan's friend and father of the children.   At 12:15 a.m. Saturday, Olayan released the four hostages inexchange for a police officer and a man identified by witnesses asJonathan Perez, 26.   Olayan eventually allowed the officer to leave, according toRoselyn Ginger Wilheln, Perez's girlfriend.   Perez had a leg amputated last month after a gunshot wound becameinfected, according to his girlfriend, Ms. Wilheln said. He wastaken from the apartment by police within 10 minutes of the start ofthe fire.   Police and firefighters found Olayan's body in the bathroom ofthe apartment. They entered the apartment at 10:33 a.m., about anhour after the fire broke out.   A nursing supervisor at St. Francis Medical Center said Perez wasin good condition. She did not specify Perez's injuries. Police saidPerez was arrested, but did not say what charges he faced.
