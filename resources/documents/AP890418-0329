On a 50-48 vote, the Senate rejected a move by Sen. Bob Graham,D-Fla., to waive provisions of the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficitreduction law in order to balloon this year's deficit to at least$213.3 billion to pay for the bailout.   Under the budget reduction law, waiving its provisions wouldhave required 60 votes.   Graham said financing the bailout costs through directborrowings by the Treasury rather than through a complexalternative off-budget scheme wanted by Bush would save taxpayers$4.5 billion over 30 years or $150 million annually in lowerinterest costs.   ``We're the generation that created this horrendous problem,that cut the cake at the party, but we're not the ones who aregoing to pay for it,'' he said. ``Since we're transferring thecosts to our children and grandchildren, the least we can do is behonest about it and try to lower the costs.''   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, questioned whether the savings throughGraham's effort would ever materialize, predicting the interestcosts on the entire federal debt could rise by as much $500 millionif it jumped by $50 billion at once.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other administrationofficials have repeatedly said they would recommend that Bush vetoany bailout package that tampered with his financing scheme.   Citing estimates that the bailout's costs are growing by $500million to $1 billion a month, Garn said, ``If we delay this billfor a few months because of a fight over a veto, we've eaten up allthe savings'' in Graham's plan.   The official estimate for the budget deficit for the currentfiscal year ending next Sept. 30 is $163.3 billion, or $27.3billion over the $136 billion Gramm-Rudman target set in September1987. But officials expect it to swell by several billion dollarsmore if interest rates do not fall or if the economy slows down.   Dumping the bailout costs into the budget would have swelled thedeficit to $213.3 billion, just $8.8 billion below the record$221.1 billion in 1986 under President Reagan.   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate gave voice vote approval to anamendment by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., to expand the RacketeeringInfluence and Corrupt Organizations Act to include crimes againstSandamp;Ls, banks and other financial institutions and the federaldeposit insurance system.   Senators who privately negotiated the Sandamp;L rescue package withthe administration over the past two weeks beat back other effortsto weaken Bush's control over the bailout.   By 66-32, the Senate defeated an amendment by Sen. Bob Kerrey,D-Neb., which would have substituted an independent board for onedominated by Cabinet members to sell some $400 billion in realestate the government is inheriting as a result of the Sandamp;L crisis.   The vote may have reflected senators' desire for an 11-dayrecess as much as an endorsement of Bush's Sandamp;L plan, which over thenext 30 years will cost a minimum of $260 billion, two-thirds of itfrom taxpayers.   ``I know how the herd instinct works around here,'' said Sen.Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who supported Kerrey's amendment. ``They cansmell that recess hour,'' he said of his fellow senators.   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, repeated his threat tocall the Senate back in on Friday and next week, if necessary, ifthe bailout package is not approved by Wednesday afternoon.Otherwise, the Senate would not meet again until May 1.   The 564-page bill was negotiated with the administration twoweeks ago largely through three behind-closed-door caucuses amongthe 12 Democrats and nine Republicans on the Senate BankingCommittee.   Similar legislation is being examined in the House, where thebanking committee is to begin acting on amendments next week.   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., andGarn, its ranking Republican, pleaded with members not to offeramendments, saying it would upset the delicate balance of a complexpackage.   ``We simply cannot afford bickering and delays,'' said Garn,citing estimates that the problem will continue to grow by $1billion a month until the rescue package is put in place.   However, senators not on the banking committee expressedresentment at the efforts by its leaders to rush action on the bill.   ``The banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom,''said Bumpers. ``To suggest that this document is sacred and everyword infallible ... (and) if the other 80 senators not on thebanking committee have no say, ... we may as well just go homenow.''   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a committee member, said thevote defeating Kerrey's amendment indicated other attempts to alterthe package also will be rejected, ``even ones that have somemerit.''   ``Once you start making exceptions ... you run the risk oflosing the balance,'' he said.   Kerrey's amendment would have established an independentseven-member board to run the Resolution Trust Corp., a new agencythat will take control of all the assets or loans of failed Sandamp;Lsand the real estate that secured them. Revenues from the sale ofthe real estate are to be used to reduce taxpayers' costs.   Bush wanted the new agency to operate under a three-member boardmade up of Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.   The Senate committee's compromise calls for a five-member boardthat would include two members appointed from the private sector inaddition to Brady, Thornburgh and Greenspan.   Because the board will have control over the greatestconcentration of land, buildings and real estate ever amassed inthe nation's history, Kerrey said the potential for a politicalscandal is unprecedented.   Other senators, however, said they want to have a boardcontrolled by Bush Cabinet members in order to be able to hold theadministration accountable if problems arise.   ``Often independent boards outside the control of anadministration become captives of interests,'' said Sen. PaulSarbanes, D-Md.</TEXT></DOC>
