The drift mobilitywas 90 cm{sup 2}/sec x V; the lifetime constant is {similar_to} 7 x 10{sup-6} sec, which is sufficient for use in detectors of ionizing radiation.The electron lifetime and drift mobility were determined by a methodbased on measurement of the electrical conductivity of the liquid underthe influence of a pulse of ionizing radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
