 Be warned, however, that XyWrite is not a word processing product forthe fainthearted.andP;  Since this popular word processor is command-driven itrequires a fairly long learning curve to attain proficiency.andM;Although XyWrite often is acclaimed by professional writers who produce largevolumes of work, I found there were difficulties with the product that wouldpreclude making it my word processor of choice.andP;  These difficulties beganduring the installation process.andM;XyWrite III Plus for local area networks comes with an extra manual for thenetwork administrator.andP;  The installation procedure is documented clearlycarefully.andP;  The trouble is, it does not work quite the way the manual says.andO;Xyquest Inc. of Billerica, Mass., the publisher of XyWrite, gives theinstaller several choices for the location of individual user log-on files.andM;In fact, on a 3Com Corp. 3+ network I could get only one of the choices towork.andP;  Even after following the instructions, I could not get XyWrite torecognize my log-on in two out of three configurations.andM;Nonetheless, XyWrite is well designed for networks.andP;  In fairness I will pointout that my favorite word processor has a few installation glitches as well.andO;One important network advantage built into XyWrite is a level of security.andO;User passwords are required when a new user logs into the product.andM;The installation procedure claims to allow user log-in files in the globalfile area, but I was unable to get that installation to work correctly.andO;XyWrite, it seems, is very unforgiving when it comes to MS-DOS paths.andM;Order From the MenuandM;The second area of difficulty, the command-driven nature of ZyWrite, isovercome partially by a neat feature called A La Carte Menus.andP;  A La CarteMenus adds a complete menuing and help system to this otherwise awkwardproduct.andM;If you do not wish to memorize all the two-character commands required tomake XyWrite III Plus work, simply press F6 and a Lotus-like menu lineappears at the top of the screen.andM;Select by moving the light bar of typing the first character of the commandyou want and an appropriate pop-up box appears with blanks for you to fillin.andP;  If you require detailed help on a topic, Alt-F9 brings down a screenwith what amounts to the manual's index.andM;One area of difficulty reported by some other XyWrite users gave me notrouble in this network version.andP;  A few users had reported difficulties whenprinting with multiple fonts and multiple printers.andM;I found no such difficulty with the following caveat:  Unlike someindustrial-strength word processors available today, XyWrite is not half wordprocessor, half desktop publisher.andM;A fair number of large scale word processors claim to bridge the gap betweenheavy-duty word processing and desktop publishing.andP;  While XyWrite has manysimilar capabilities multiple fonts, style sheets, columns, footnotes and thelike, this product is best suited to projects that depend on sophisticatedtext manipulation as opposed to fancy output.andM;One of XyWrite's useful text manipulation features is its redliningcapability.andP;  Redlining is the process by which text undergoes progressivelevels of revision.andP;  The technique is most successful when writers andeditors can see the editing steps and the results of those steps.andM;XyWrite allows multiple users on a network to participate in the editingprocess.andP;  It offers a number of choices as to the way editing is captured anddisplayed.andP;  For groups producing detailed reports, manuals, long documents,and other much-edited output, XyWrite III Plus for the networks can be anexcellent choice.andM;Regarding network performance, I saw little or no performance degradation asI simulated multiple users on the 3Com 3+ network.andP;  There are a few featuresI would like to see that do not seem to be available in this otherwisecomprehensive product.andM;Save ItandM;Chief among these is an automatic-save function that periodically saves workto a disk file without user intervention.andP;  Networks go down from time totime, and if that happens while you are using XyWrite, you will lose yourwork if you have not saved frequently.andM;Actually, the save mechanism is a bit awkward.andP;  If you SAVE your work, yousave to disk but you can go on working in the document.andP;  If you STORE thedocument, it is wiped from the screen and saved to disk.andP;  The bottom line is,do not forget to SAVE frequently or you could lose a lot of work.andM;There also are a couple of other features available that I found useful.andO;Along with the obligatory spelling checker, XyWrite contains a comprehensivethesaurus.andP;  The spelling checker, however, has an automatic feature availablethat checks spelling, word by word, as you type.andM;Although I liked this feature a lot, what I liked even more was the abilityto turn it off and check the whole document.andM;A second useful feature is XyWrite's directory tree.andP;  The XyWrite treecapability helps users locate these lost files.andM;Is XyWrite III Plus for networks the word processor for you?andP;  If you withlarge amounts of text, do group writing or editing, and do not mind learningmany two-character commands, it could be.andM;As a heavy-duty text manipulator this product is among the most powerful Ihave seen.andP;  If fancy output or ease of use is an issue, better leave this oneon the shelf.andM;A server license for XyWrite III Plus is $795, and a user station licensecosts $195.andP;  An upgrade to server license from single user is $495.andM;Single-station upgrades from XyWrite II, II Plus and III are $60 each.andP;  Asingle-station upgrade from III Plus is $10.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
