Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a ``package of warlaws'' is being decreed by the the Panamanian government as part ofan effort to ``eliminate the last vestiges of democracy and rule oflaw.''   As an example, she said civil servants could be fired fordisloyalty under the new measures being planned and the right ofhabeas corpus is to be eliminated.   ``These war laws purportedly will strip Panamanians of theirremaining civil liberties and human rights,'' she said.   Meanwhile, Bush summoned Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chairmanof the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. William CohenR-Maine, the vice chairman, following a week of congressionalcriticism about the way the administration handled the abortiveuprising.   In a statement issued afterward, Boren indicated that themeeting was designed, in part, to avoid a repeat of the snafus thatoccurred during the abortive uprising last week in Panama.   ``I feel that our discussion, which focused on intelligencematters, will be of great help to our country if we ever confrontcrises like the Panama situation in the future,'' Boren said.Afterward, Boren flew to Oklahoma and was unavailable to elaborateon his statement.   Wednesday night, Bush brushed off any hint of bad feeling overthe congressional criticism he got on the Panama matter, sayingcriticism was to be expected always, and said he had an amiablemeeting with Boren and Cohen.   ``There was never any bad blood,'' he told reporters at a statedinner in honor of Italian President Francesco Cossiga.   ``I'm not angry,'' he said in response to reports that heheatedly chastised his staff and laid down the law that there wasto be no more second-guessing.   Bush predicted that as the smoke clears people will agree withhim. ``I have no second guesses at all, '' he said.   Administration officials have said that poor communications andconfused signals contributed to the failure of the coup attempt.   Wednesday's meeting occurred three days after Boren and NationalSecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft clashed over whether Senaterestrictions inhibited the administration's ability to fulfill itsgoal of ousting Noriega.   Vice President Dan Quayle said the meeting with the senatorsconcluded with everyone ``on the same wave length. I believe it wasa very good, productive meeting.''   But on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchellaimed new criticism at the administration for seeking to blame itsinaction on congressionally imposed constraints.   ``The efforts by some within the administration to shiftresponsibility for decisions ... to the Senate IntelligenceCommittee are ill-founded, unfair and counterproductive,'' saidMitchell, D-Maine.   It is legitimate, he said, for Congress to inquire into ``howthe administration could have been so unprepared when what it hadlong been urging took place.''   At the State Department, Ms. Tutwiler denied assertions by somerebel leaders who have been given sanctuary in Florida that theinsurgents were promised much more support by the United Statesthan was actually given.   She specifically denied that the rebels had asked for U.S. airsupport to prevent the airlifting of pro-Noriega reinforcements toPanama City after the coup attempt got under way.   Ms. Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III wasdisturbed by unnamed State Department officials quoted in newspaperaccounts as being critical of other agencies involved in the eventslast week in Panama.   She said Baker told a staff meeting last Friday he wanted to seea stop to such criticism.   Meanwhile, seven Latin American presidents, meeting in Peru,discussed the proposed expulsion of Panama from an eight-memberhemispheric consultative group.   Panama's membership was suspended in 1988 after Noriega arrangedthe dismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who had tried to fireNoriega as military commander.   Peru and Venezuela are among members pushing for Panama'sexpulsion.   ``We cannot permit a country like Panama that scoffs at andridicules the democratic system to contnue with us,'' saidGuillermo Larco Cox, Peru's foreign minister.   Diplomatic sources said Mexico and some others felt expulsionwould amount to interference in the internal affairs of anothercountry.</TEXT></DOC>
