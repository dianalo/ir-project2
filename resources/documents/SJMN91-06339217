For the last couple of months, he's beenmaking enemies for George Bush. Down in the polls and up against a re-electioncampaign, the president finally axed the last of the Thanksgiving turkeys.We'll not mourn.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SUN SETS ON SUNUNUHE HAD TO BE SHOT DOWN FOR ARROGANCE, BUT BUSH'SREAL PROBLEMS REMAIN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Sununu's most important mistake was arrogance, but we're not talkingmanners here. We're talking about an all-pervasive, world-class arrogance thatblinded him to taxpayer concerns about public employee perks, spawned hisdefiant attitude toward Congress, and bred the you-can't-get-along-without- meattitude so reminiscent of his predecessors, Al Haig and H.R. Haldeman.;  With the White House in chaos and the 1992 Republican campaign endangered,someone had to go -- anyone would do, actually, so long as he spelled his lastname with two N's and three U's and was utterly out of touch with the Americanpeople.;   After all, part of the job, when you're No. 2, is to take a fallfor the top guy. Meet Sununu the symbol. How do you do, I'm John, I'm theproblem, and now I'm outa here. Presto chango: no more problem.;   That may bethe way people think at the Bush White House, but it's not the way things workin real life. Banishing Sununu may ease White House relations with Congress,but it won't fill the void caused by George Bush's lack of interest in theeconomy and other domestic issues. Nor, for that matter, will clever campaignslogans.;   You can fool folks when they're fat and happy, but you can't foolAmericans who are worried about keeping their jobs, and who're making do thisChristmas with a lot less than last year. George Bush made Americans proudwith the war against Iraq, but that's history. People want to know, Mr.President, what you've done for us lately.;   And without John Sununu there tosay it doesn't matter, you just might have to find an answer.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911204  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  337  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 4, 199100339217,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
