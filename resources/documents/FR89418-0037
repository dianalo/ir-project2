The estimated margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. We also determine that criticalcircumstances exist with respect to industrial belts from Israel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>On January 26, 1989, we made an affirmative preliminary determination (54FR 5105, February 1, 1989). We received comments from petitioner and respondent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts from Israelcurrently provided for under Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated(TSUSA) item numbers 358.0210, 358.0290, 358.0610, 358.0690, 358.0800,358.0900, 358.1100, 358.1400, 358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510 and 773.3520;and currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) sub-headings3926.90.55, 3926.90.56, 3926.90.57, 3926.90.59, 3926.90.60, 4010.10.10,4010.10.50, 4010.91.11, 4010.91.15, 4010.91.19, 4010.91.50, 4010.99.11,4010.99.15, 4010.99.19, 4010.99.50, 5910.00.10, 5910.00.90, and 7326.20.00.The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lifttrucks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation is January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of industrial belts from Israel to the UnitedStates were made at less than fair value, we compared the United Statesprice to the foreign market value. For our preliminary determination weused best information available as required by section 776(c) of the Act.As best information available, we took the highest margin contained inthe petition for each of the product types for the period of investigationand calculated a simple average of those figures to determine a marginfor the products under investigation. Since the respondent, Magam, failedto participate in the investigation, we are using the same methodologyfor calculating a margin for the final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>United States price was based on the U.S. price information provided inthe petition pursuant to section 772 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>Foreign market value was based on home market prices provided in the petitionpursuant to section 773 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On June 30, 1988, petitioner alleged that critical circumstances existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Israel. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United states or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.Since the respondent, Magam, failed to participate in the investigation,we are determining that critical circumstances for this respondent existbased on best information available. As best information available, weare assuming that imports of industrial belts have been massive over arelatively short period of time. In determining knowlege of dumping, theDepartment normally considers margins of 25% or more sufficient to imputeknowledge of dumping under section 735(a)(3)(A) (<T3>sene, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Valuie;Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, fromItaly</T3> (52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987)). Therefore, in accordance withsections 735(a)(3)(A)(ii) and 735(a)(3)(B), we determine that criticalcircumstances exist with respect to Magam.With respect to firms covered by the ``All Other'' rate, we have determinedthat imports of industrial belts have not been massive over a relativelyshort period of time and, therefore that critical circumstances do notexist.Since we do not find that there have been massive imports of industrialbelts from firms included in the ``All Other'' rate, we do not need toconsider whether there is a history of dumping or whether importers ofthese products knew or should have known that the merchandise was beingsold at less than fair value.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1:</T3> Petitioner argues that, based on U.S. import statistics,IM 146 data, the Department should find that there have been massive importsof industrial belts over a relatively short period of time. Petitionerfurther asserts that an antidumping margin of 25% or more is sufficientto impute knowledge to the importer that the exporter was selling the merchandiseat less than fair value.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Since the respondent, Magam, failed to participatein the investigation, as best information available, we are assuming thatits imports of industrial belts from Israel have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time. Furthermore, we find that the best information availablemargin of 89.65% is sufficient to impute knowledge to the importer thatthe exporter was selling the merchandise at less than fair value.With regard to firms covered by the ``All Other'' rate, see the ``CriticalCircumstances'' section of this determination.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department's final determinationshould be based on the highest less-than-fair-value margin alleged in thepetition.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department is applying the same methodologyused in the preliminary determination to calculate the margins for thefinal determination. As best information available, we are taking the highestmargin contained in the petition for each of the product types for theperiod of those figures to determine the margin for the products underinvestigation.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Petitioner asserts that in its scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four HTS sub-headings.Petitioner requests that the Department list eighteen HTS sub-headingsin its final determination.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. The petition included nine TSUSA itemnumbers and four HTS sub-headings that petitioner believed would correspondto the TSUSA numbers when the HTS system became effective.The Harmonized Tariff Schedule went into effect on January 1, 1989. Basedon a concordance between TSUSA item numbers and HTS sub-headings listedin a January 1989 USITC publication,<T3> The Continuity of Import and Export Trade Statistics After Implementationof the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, </T3>petitionerrequested that the Department expand the four HTS sub-headings listed inour preliminary determination to eighteen sub-headings. We asked for commentsfrom the interested parties in this investigation concerning industrialbelts covered by the eighteen HTS sub-headings.In our preliminary determinations, as now, we note that the written descriptionof the products covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of theproduct coverage. We do not view providing additional HTS sub-headingsas broadening the scope of this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of industrial belts from Israel, as defined in the ``Scopeof Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days priorto the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Normally, we would instruct the U.S. Customs Service to require a cashdeposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by whichthe foreign market of subject merchandise from Israel exceeds the UnitedStates price as shown below. However, Artical VI.5 of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade provides that ``no * * * product shall be subjectto both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the samesituation of dumping or export subsidization.'' This provision is implementedby section 722(d)(1)(D) of the Act which prohibits assessing dumping dutieson the portion of the margin attributable to an export subsidy, since thereis not reason to require a cash deposit or bond for the amount. Therefore,the bonding rate in this investigation will be reduced by the rate attributableto the export subsidies found in the concurrent countervailing duty determination.Accordingly, for duty deposit purposes, the bonding rate is 79.25% forMagam and all other manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise from Israel.The cash deposit or bonding rate established in the preliminary determinationshall remain in effect with respect to entries or withdrawals from warehousemade prior to the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The suspension of liquidation will remain ineffect until further notice. The margin percentages are shown below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s50,10</C> <H1>Manufacturer/producer/exporter</H1><H1>Margin percentage</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Magam<D>79.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All others <D>79.25</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury,does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities postedas a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled.However, if the ITC determines that material injury does exist, the Departmentwill issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officials to assessantidumping duties on industrial belts from Israel entered, or withdrawnfor warehouse, for consumption on or after the effective date of the suspensionof liquidation, equal to the amount by which the foreign market value exceedsthe United States price.This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1673d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="21">April 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
