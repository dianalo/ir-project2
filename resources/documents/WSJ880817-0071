The instant photography concern recently adopted anti-takeover measures and had been expected to oppose Shamrock's unsolicited offer. Polaroid said that, based partly on an opinion from its financial adviser, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., its board concluded Shamrock's bid is &quot;inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.&quot;    Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based concern owned by the Roy E. Disney family, last week proposed to acquire Polaroid for $40 a share, or about $2.48 billion, plus 40% of the proceeds from Polaroid's expected recovery in a major patent infringement lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co. Analysts estimate that Shamrock's latest offer could have a value of as much as $3.28 billion. Shamrock, which owns 6.8% of Polaroid's stock, earlier had offered $40 a share.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Polaroid closed at $43.375 a share, up 87.5 cents.    Shamrock officials declined to comment on Polaroid's rejection of the offer. However, Shamrock reportedly is considering a hostile tender offer for Polaroid.    Polaroid signaled that it doesn't plan to seek a white knight or to go private in order to thwart Shamrock's overtures. The company said its board &quot;unanimously determined&quot; that in light of Polaroid's business prospects, including its expected recovery from the Eastman Kodak lawsuit, it should continue as an independent, publicly-owned company. &quot;The sale of the company would not be appropriate,&quot; Polaroid's board said.    As previously reported, Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a leveraged buy-out concern based in New York, earlier approached Polaroid about a friendly takeover but was rebuffed, according to Wall Street sources.    Polaroid said its board amended the company's shareholder rights plan to lower to 20% from 40% the level of ownership in Polaroid that would trigger certain anti-takeover provisions. Among earlier anti-takeover moves, Polaroid sold 9.7 million newly issued shares to a new employee stock ownership plan. Shamrock has filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn Polaroid's ESOP.    Separately, a group including Shamrock Holdings and its affiliates said it received clearance from federal antitrust regulators to buy 50% or more of Polaroid's common shares. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Shamrock said the Federal Trade Commission granted it early termination of a 30-day waiting period for such purchases required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act. </TEXT></DOC>
