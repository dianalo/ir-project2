The suspicions arose after Germany held back during theGulf crisis and then acted to recognize the breakawayYugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia againstWashington's wishes.</LP><TEXT>   Concerns about the relationship were fed by a recentopinion poll indicating that 57% of Germans favor the removalof U.S. troops from their territory and that 70% favorremoval of nuclear weapons. The report, commissioned by theRand Corp., a U.S. think tank, also indicated Germansoverwhelmingly favor continued membership in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and are positively inclinedtoward the U.S.   German officials said the most important effort to injectmore life into relations with the U.S. would come at theWorld Economic Summit in Munich in July. Chancellor HelmutKohl, as this year's chairman of the Group of Sevenindustrial nations, wants to press the European Community,over French objections, to reduce farm protectionism and saveinternational trade talks from failure.   Mr. Kohl's efforts signal the Chancellery's support forPresident Bush in an election year where protectionism is amajor theme. German officials credit Mr. Bush forWashington's support for their unification. &quot;Kohl knows thathe can't send Bush home from the summit in Munichempty-handed only weeks before November elections,&quot; said onesenior government adviser. &quot;We have to make clear in Munichthat we have solved this problem with the French so that Bushcan go home and declare victory.&quot;   Indeed, Bonn's G-7 chairmanship puts it in theuncomfortable position of choosing between conflicting Frenchand U.S. approaches at a time when Mr. Bush and FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand face political challenges athome. France has been the most reluctant of the EC members toreduce state subsidies and protection for domestic farmers.   &quot;We aren't deciding between Paris and Washington,&quot; saysone Bonn policy maker. &quot;It is in European interests thattrade talks not fail. If that means a European governmentfalls, we are sorry. But if the U.S. goes away from Munichsaying to hell with the Europeans, or if Bush loses theelections and a protectionist president is elected, that isfar worse for European interests&quot; than Mr. Mitterrand'spolitical demise.   Underlying the German approach toward Washington in 1992is a belief that Washington will increasingly be the onlyconsistent friend on which a more influential Germany canrely. The British and French are wary of enhanced Germaninfluence and economic might, but Washington views Bonn asthe most effective representative for its concerns inEuropean councils and its most important global partner amongEuropeans.   &quot;We can't turn to the French and it is too obvious when weturn to the British,&quot; said one U.S. official, &quot;but we havefound the Germans to be willing to honestly represent ourconcerns and sometimes intervene on our behalf on theEuropean stage.&quot;   German and U.S. officials agree relations have remainedgood despite differences regarding the Gulf War andYugoslavia, which senior Washington officials generallyattribute to Germany's growing pains. Frictions overGermany's high interest rates, which U.S. critics say haveslowed world economic growth, are also likely to subside incoming months when the Bundesbank is likely to lower rates.But the closeness that characterized the relationship duringthe heady days of German unification in 1990 has been lost.   U.S. experts also cite the new Rand poll as evidence thatGerman foreign policy leadership is lacking. The survey,taken in late 1991 by Infratest Burke-Berlin, showed thatGermans had gained in self-confidence but still lacked anyclear direction regarding how to use their increased globalinfluence. The poll showed that 59% of Germans wanted theircountry to assume greater international responsibility, anincrease of more than eight percentage points in one year.Some 64% believed Germany would play a greater world role bythe year 2000.   But Germans were clear that role shouldn't include troopinvolvement in interventions sanctioned by the UnitedNations, such as in the Gulf War. When asked whether theinternational community had the right to intervene when humanrights and international law were violated within a givencountry, 56% said no. In short, Germans are more comfortablewith a relationship with the U.S. like the one exhibited inthe Gulf War, where they help pay the bills but U.S. troopsfight.   The G-7 meeting, say German officials, will be the climaxin a series of planned explicit signals that Bonn hopes tosend to Washington in coming weeks. Mr. Kohl has asked thegeneral-secretary of the Christian Democratic party, VolkerRuehe, to shift his emphasis from repairing eastern Germanyto improving links to Washington. He will travel there inearly March. Even Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher,who privately opposed U.S. policies in the Gulf and who ledGermany's unilateral actions regarding Yugoslavia, hasentered the campaign.   In a column that appeared in the large-circulation Welt amSonntag newspaper this week, Mr. Genscher recalled America'sBerlin airlift that saved the city in one of the Cold War'sfirst crises and he also reminded readers of the&quot;indispensable&quot; role played by the U.S. in the country'sunification. But a German official said the initiative forthe article came from Mr. Genscher's advisers, who sensedpotential problems with Washington following Germany'sunilateral decision to recognize Croatia and Slovenia, andnot from the foreign minister himself.</TEXT></DOC>
