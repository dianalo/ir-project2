Daily shelling by Syrian forceshas driven most residents underground and sapped the life from theregion once known as the Monte Carlo of the Middle East.   The barrages have eased since the Arab League called for acease-fire May 11, but a gas shortage has paralyzed the region,adding to the problems of a Christian population outnumbered andoutgunned by Syria and its allies.   ``If it's not shelling, it's gas, and if it's not gas it'ssomething else,'' said Samira Khater, a secretary.   An air of stupor hangs over the 310-square-mile enclave, home toabout 1 million Christians.   There is hardly any traffic. Business is slow. Factories thatsurvived 11 weeks of ferocious shelling limp along with skeletonstaffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge.   Restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day. Half theshops, hidden behind sandbags and earth-filled oildrums, areshuttered.   The night life that once throbbed in the clubs, bars andrestaurants along the Mediterranean coastline is dead.   The famous Casino du Liban, where oil-rich sheiks and highrollers from around the world gambled, is closed.   It was a regular target for Syrian gunners who have battled theforces of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun since March 8 in someof the most savage battles of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.   Some 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded,mostly civilians.   The Christians are tired and dispirited, struggling to cope witha grim fatalism.   The Syrians maintain their blockade of the Christian enclave,ringed on its landward sides by hostile Moslem forces.   Small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in foodand ammunition for the Christians, so there is no shortage of thoseitems. But the blockade runners don't try bringing in gas.   ``It only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel,'' apolice spokesman said.   Supermarkets bulge with imported goods _ pink chamapagne,passion fruit tea, 10 brands of whisky, cookies, chocolates, hams,cheeses.   Fruit and vegetables are in short supply, but available for aprice. Before the fighting, most produce came fromSyrian-controlled areas. Now they are smuggled in at night by muletrain from the north.   The enclave's fuel reserves went up in flames when a Syrianbarrage blew up the seaside Dora depot in east Beirut two monthsago.   The French, Lebanon's colonial rulers until 1943 and theChristians' traditional protector, shipped in 4,000 tons of fuel toreactivate closed power plants a few weeks ago.   But there's precious little gasoline around. Only aboutone-fifth of filling stations bother to open.   Police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded ingunfights over gas.   A worker at one filling station, who did not want to beidentified, said it opens ``only when the army can send a tank tomaintain order.''   ``That's why people have to wait for days in front of thestations, and all they get in the end is 10 liters,'' a little morethan two gallons, he said.   Gas costs about $3.50 for 5{ gallons, but on the black marketthe same amount is going for $50 _ a month's wages for manyLebanese.   ``Filling station owners pump out the gas from their tanks andsell it on the black market for 10 times the price,'' said onemotorist.   Long lines of cars, some extending for a mile, sit outside manystations.   ``At first, everyone used to wait for days in their cars, evenduring the shelling,'' grocer Samir Madi said. ``Now we take turnsto wait for a station to open.   ``When it does, whoever's keeping vigil telephones everyone elseand they all rush to the station.''   The casualties and damage wrought by Aoun's ``war ofliberation'' to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon has turned manyChristians against the man many hail as their hero.   ``Aoun has used the Christian people,'' said one young man whodeclined to be identified. ``He's led them into a dark tunnel ofhunger, death and siege because of his personal ambition to becomepresident.''</TEXT></DOC>
