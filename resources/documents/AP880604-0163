He said the committee sent a letter to President Raif Dizdarevicdemanding the release of Janez Jansa, who was arrested Tuesday inLjubljana after reporting alleged plans for a military coup in thenorthern republic of Slovenia.   A journalist and one of four candidates for president of theSlovenian Socialist Youth Union, Jansa had published a number ofarticles in liberal periodicals criticizing army policies.   In one he said the military planned a coup in Slovenia to quelldissent in Yugoslavia's most liberal republic. That report wasdenied last week by the government.   A committee member, speaking with the condition he not beidentified, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview fromLjubljana that Jansa has refused to be represented by a militarylawyer and apparently has decided to defend himself at his trial.   In a statement issued Friday, the Slovenian Socialist Youth Unionsaid information about Jansa's detention was ``insufficient andcontradictory, which leads us to doubt the correctness of theprocedure.''   The army has said Jansa is being held at a military prison, buthas refused to release details about his arrest.</TEXT></DOC>
