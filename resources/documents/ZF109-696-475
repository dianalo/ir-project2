Metcalf, AFAFC commander, said installment of thesystem suggests &quot;the Air Force is moving out to take the lead to create astandardized civilian pay system for the entire DOD.&quot;andM;Under DOD's corporate information management plan and the fortcomingconsolidation of finance and accounting centers, Pentagon officials have saidthey plan to pare down the variety of civilian pay system to just one system.andM;Candidates for the system also could emerge from the Army and Navy.andP;  Bothhave been making upgrades to their pay system at finance centers and bases.andM;Air Force officials, however, believe the fully centralized nature of theirnew system is advantageous to other existing DOD systems.andP;  Most large DODfinance systems operate through a middle-level processing center locatedbetween the base and the finance center.andM;Raisio declined to compare AFAFC's new system with any other services'system, saying only that the Air Force system &quot;is an attractive and logicalcandidate to be DOD's single civilian pay system.&quot;andM;He said officials did a cost comparison study six years ago and found bycutting out the midlevel processing site, they could reduce operating costsby about $4 million annually.andM;Besides computing net pay, applications developed for the system can beperform leave accounting, process time and attendance records, provideinterfaces to separate personnel accounting systems and support employee datacollection tasks, Raisio said.andM;The new system will replace manual processes for updating accounts,maintaining retirement records, changing pay records retroactively andcomputing records for special employees paid through the Fair Labor StandardsAct, he said.andM;AFAFC officials also said they believe improved networking between the basesand the Denver center brought about by the pay system untimely will translateinto faster processing in other business areas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
