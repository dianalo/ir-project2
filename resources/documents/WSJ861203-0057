Israeli assertions that the arms sales were designed primarily to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon fly in the face of President Reagan's explanation that the arms transfers were designed to improve relations with Iran and didn't amount to an exchange of arms for hostages. And, because money from the arms sales went to the Contras in Nicaragua, Israel is deeply worried it will lose backing in Congress, the source of much of its U.S. support.    Strategic questions, such as strengthening Iranian &quot;moderates&quot; and influencing the balance of the Iran-Iraq war, were considered only of secondary importance to freeing the hostages, say Israeli officials who are familiar with their country's role as conduit for U.S. arms to Iran.    &quot;We thought of ourselves through the whole period as only an instrument -- and the purpose was linked only to freeing American hostages and not the strategic question,&quot; says one Israeli official.    Similarly, Israeli arms dealer Ya'acov Nimrodi, who participated in the launching of the Iranian operation, said in a statement this week that the program was born when he was asked by the Israeli government at a 1985 meeting &quot;to try and see if there is any way to bring about the freedom of the American hostages.&quot; American hostages in Lebanon have been held by Iranian-influenced Islamic groups.    Israeli officials don't quarrel with the tactic of exchanging arms for hostages. Indeed, despite its tough anti-terrorism image, Israel has dealt with terrorists to free Israeli prisoners when a military rescue wasn't possible.    U.S. and Israeli versions of the arms-sale story differ on an even more sensitive point: whether Israel funneled arms sales proceeds to Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The Reagan administration asserts that Israel sent profits from the arms sales to Contra bank accounts, while Israeli officials unanimously insist Israel didn't handle any of the money.    Yesterday, in an apparent attempt to prevent a rift with the U.S. over the differing explanations, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said President Reagan's explanations of his objective were &quot;reasonable and acceptable.&quot;    Israeli officials don't want this dispute to blossom into a crisis in Israel's relations with Congress, which Israelis consider even more important to them than the White House. The U.S. version implies that Israel was a leading player in a conspiracy to circumvent the congressional ban on aid to the Contras. The same lawmakers who banned Contra aid must approve billions of dollars in U.S. aid to Israel. U.S. congressional investigators are sure to demand interviews with Israeli officials.    So Israeli officials are denying the Contra link several times a day. &quot;I know for sure no Israeli prime minister would even think of collaborating in an attempt to circumvent Congress -- ever,&quot; says Dan Meridor, a prominent member of the Likud bloc and an associate of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.    But even Israeli officials say they can't rule out the possibility that private Israeli arms dealers, who floated in and out of the Iranian arms program, handled some of the money.    According to Israeli sources:   Israel began selling arms to Iran in 1981 and 1982, when American-made spare parts were sent to Tehran in a bid to bolster &quot;moderates&quot; then still believed to be in the Iranian army.    When Secretary of State George Shultz called for an end to shipments of U.S. spare parts, Israel complied. But officials acknowledge that private Israeli arms dealers continued to send Israeli-made weapons to Iran.    The official channels reopened in 1985, when U.S. officials sought ways to free American hostages in Lebanon. Mr. Nimrodi, the arms dealer, made contact with Iranian arms buyers. Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi played a role in arranging the connections. The initial arms shipment went in late summer of 1985, and American hostage Benjamin Weir soon was released.    Though it isn't clear whether the U.S. approved that shipment, President Reagan did send a personal message of thanks to Shimon Peres, then Israel's prime minister, for his help in the hostage release.    In late 1985, the U.S. asked that the private arms dealers be replaced by Israeli officials, to raise the arms program to what one Israeli calls an &quot;institutionalized, government-to-government level.&quot;    Their place was taken by 36-year-old Amiram Nir, a former think-tank academic who is the prime minister's special adviser on terrorism.    More arms were sent in early 1986 and this fall. But Israelis insist that estimates of the amount of arms shipped are wildly exaggerated. One Israeli who was involved estimates that the total market value of the arms sent in late 1985 and 1986 was $25 million to $30 million, and that Iran paid $8 million to $12 million above that in fees and charges. </TEXT></DOC>
