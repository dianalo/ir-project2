Nonetheless, they supported many Democrat-sponsored amendments, eitherto hurry debate along or to make the bill so heavy with new conditions thatwavering senators would abandon it.;    &quot;I don't support the bill in itscurrent form,&quot; Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said at one point, commenting on anamendment to tie most-favored-nation status to China's reducing economicsupport for Cuba. &quot;If this amendment worsens it a little more, then I'm forit.&quot;;    The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., addresses amatter of first-degree importance to Florida's 750,000-strong Cuban exilecommunity. It passed by voice vote. Three other amendments also were adoptedby voice vote after perfunctory debate.;    In a 10-minute speech that closedthe debate, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, decried theChinese government for what he called &quot;systematic cheating&quot; in trade,&quot;reckless behavior&quot; in weapons sales to Third World countries, and suppressionof &quot;the universal desire for freedom.&quot;;    Mitchell was the sponsor of thebill to extend most-favored-nation status -- which gives China and many othernations the lowest U.S. tariffs -- for one more year but linked furtherrenewals to progress in human rights, weapons proliferation and trade.;   Placing conditions on most-favored-nation status is &quot;the logical and moralway&quot; to get the Chinese government to change its ways, Mitchell said. &quot;TheChinese people believed in our word, and the question now is, do we?&quot;; Chinatoday rejected the effort to impose political conditions on renewal of itstrade status.;    A Foreign Ministry statement read on the evening televisionnews called the congressional demands interference in China's internalaffairs. &quot;China cannot accept this,&quot; it said.;    &quot;We hope that more and moresenators and congressmen will value U.S.-China relations and upholdunconditional extension of China's (trading) status, so that this issue canfinally reach an appropriate solution,&quot; the Foreign Ministry statement said.;The Senate bill will be married to similar legislation passed earlier thismonth by the House. The finished product will be sent to Bush, and he isexpected to veto it.;    This course of events, predicted for weeks, has keptattention focused on the Senate, where Mitchell and his supporters need 67votes to override the expected veto. Seven Democrats, most of them from farmstates, voted against the measure while six Republican conservatives voted forit. Nevertheless, with only 55 yes votes on the bill, the veto seemed safe.;   California's two senators voted with their parties, with Democrat AlanCranston voting yes and Republican John Seymour no.;    The president'sRepublican supporters appeared confident when debate on the bill began lateMonday. Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said that &quot;nothing like thislegislation is going to be enacted into law,&quot; and challenged the Democrats topresent all their amendments &quot;en bloc&quot; so that senators could move at once tovote on the bill.;    &quot;Why bother with another vote?&quot; asked Sen. RichardLugar, R-Ind., a staunch Bush supporter. &quot;If you don't favor a conditionsbill, it really doesn't matter how many amendments you have.&quot;;    Under thebill, China must account for and release all political prisoners, cease exportof products produced by prison labor, adhere to international agreementsregarding Hong Kong, adopt a policy limiting arms proliferation and make&quot;significant progress&quot; in curtailing human rights abuses and ending traderestrictions. In addition, the bill requires that the president certify thatChina does not export ballistic missiles or launchers or nuclear technology toSyria or Iran.;    Senate demands; The Senate-passed bill demands that China:;(box) Release political prisoners detained after the Tiananmen Squareprotest.; (box) Halt exports of goods produced with prison labor.; (box) Endmilitary aid to Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.; (box) Make &quot;significant progress&quot;toward civil freedoms.; (box) Stop harassing Chinese citizens in the U.S.;(box) Respect American copyrights.; (box) Restrict arms sales.; (box) Providefair access to Chinese markets.;    Source: Associated Press  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910724  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  767  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 24, 199100206271,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
