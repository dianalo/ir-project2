Targets   Iraq's Leftover   Nuclear Material   ---   Baghdad Today Must List   Sites of Weapons That   Teams Are to Remove   ----   By John J.

Iraqi officials have hinted that their nuclear facilitieswere totally ruined by the allied bombing. But PaulLeventhal, president of the Washington-based Nuclear ControlInstitute, worries that Baghdad may have used the bombing as&quot;the perfect cover&quot; to remove the nuclear material whileclaiming it was destroyed. Mr. Leventhal said the Iraqistrongman &quot;may well have the infrastructure still in place todo one or two quick and dirty bombs.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   To resolve this issue, U.S. officials said, inspectionteams from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA,probably will have to excavate the bombed ruins of two Iraqinuclear sites -- one a small research reactor, the other afuel-testing facility -- to see if the radioactive, enricheduranium is still there.   &quot;It's going to be quite an exercise and quite expensive,&quot;said one official, who asked not to be identified. He saidthe nuclear part of the job, despite the hazards involved,likely will be the &quot;easiest&quot; part of the mission, which couldtake months.   Under the cease-fire agreement Iraq signed April 3,Baghdad today must give the U.N. secretary-general a preciseinventory of its nuclear, biological and chemical weaponssites. After that, it must cooperate with the search of thesites and the removal of dangerous materials. Only thenuclear material will be removed from Iraq, according to aU.N. diplomat involved in setting up a commission to overseethe effort. The chemical, biological and missile-relatedmaterials &quot;will probably be destroyed in place,&quot; he said.   The effort could yield what one official called &quot;anintelligence bonanza&quot; by identifying foreign companies thatsupplied technology to the clandestine Iraqi weaponsprograms. It also could provide a measure of theeffectiveness of the U.S. bombing effort, which was designedto make it more likely that the debris would bury the nuclearfuel and other dangerous materials and machinery, making theminaccessible until the war was over.   &quot;There was no way to know how long this war was going tolast,&quot; said one Pentagon official, asserting that bombingnuclear facilities at Tuwaitha, a suburb of Baghdad, was thebest way to assure that the 49 pounds of enriched uraniumbelieved to be there -- enough to make at least oneHiroshima-sized bomb -- couldn't be removed.   Among the many questions being mulled at the U.N. is thesafety of U.N. inspection teams, who may face mines, poisons,radiation and civil war as they comb Iraq for weapons sites.U.N. forces or security teams from the U.S. and otherindividual nations probably will accompany some of theinspectors as they visit the Iraqi sites, many of which weredesigned to withstand bombing raids.   Hans Friedrich Meyer, a spokesman for the U.N.-affiliatedagency, said it has sent a team of officials to New York toawait orders to begin the inspections. Generally, the IAEAmerely examines countries' nuclear facilities to make surethey aren't violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty byproducing weapons. &quot;We have never had to take custody ofmaterial and remove it from the site before,&quot; said Mr. Meyer,adding that a second team of IAEA experts is forming inVienna to do the job.   Normally IAEA inspections are quick, clerical affairswhere technicians use gamma-ray detectors to check the typeand quantity of nuclear fuel present. In the case ofTuwaitha, they must visit the site of a Soviet researchreactor and a French-built fuel-testing facility, both ofwhich have been bombed into rubble. Under the cease-fireagreement, they also have the right to search for material inany other site they suspect may contain it in Iraq.   While the IAEA has expertise in inspecting nuclearmaterials, the U.N. is assembling teams from scratch to dealwith other weapons. The U.S. and the Soviet Union, accordingto the U.N. diplomat, probably will take the lead indestroying Iraqi missile facilities. Belgium, which hasconsiderable experience in finding and removing World War Imustard gas shells, has volunteered its help in the chemicalweapons area.   If Iraq misses today's deadlines, it will have a hard timepersuading the U.N. Security Council to ease its ban on thesale of Iraqi oil. Iraqi officials say they need to sell oilto raise money to buy emergency food supplies. Silence fromIraq also would increase tension in Israel, where officialsso far have agreed not to retaliate for Iraqi Scud missileattacks.   &quot;If the cease-fire provisions aren't enforced, the U.S.will lose vital credit and trust here,&quot; said Gerald M.Steinberg, a defense expert at Bar Ilan University. Israel&quot;will be even more reluctant than before to entrust itsinterests to American promises.&quot;   Secretary of State James Baker, who participated in thearm-twisting that forestalled Israeli retaliation during thewar, is scheduled to arrive in Israel today. He undoubtedlywill hear complaints such as one from an Israeli defenseofficial who insists: &quot;There's no doubt that Iraq can stillhit Israel with Scuds.&quot;   ---   Peter Waldman in Jerusalem contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
