(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Nobel laureate said Thursday that noneof the scientists who spent three days discussing experiments onroom-temperature fusion believes the research is a key to creatingenergy.   However, Robert J. Schrieffer said, chemists and physicists arefinally talking to each other and are forming collaborations towork together on various cold fusion projects.   The Workshop on Cold Fusion Phenomenon, attended by 440researchers from 14 nations, concluded Thursday without reaching aconsensus other than that researchers have a lot of work to do.   Physicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists wrangledover the conclusions reached in numerous experiments performed inthe two months since University of Utah researchers announced theyhad produced nuclear fusion in a jar.   The debate centers over the phenomenon of excess heat reportedby the Utah researchers and the subsequent discovery of nuclearfusion indicators, such as neutrons, reported by other scientiststrying to verify the Utah work.   No one has reported both heat and nuclear particles, leadingsome to conclude that the Utah experiment did not produce coldfusion.   Schrieffer, of the University of California at Santa Barbara,said he believes the presence of heat without observed nuclearparticles is a ``smoking gun'' in the Utah experiments.   ``I personally do not believe the heat was from anything but achemical process,'' he said at a news conference after the sessionended.   However, he also said he believes experiments that foundevidence of a low level of neutrons or gamma rays indicated energywas coming from a fusion source, and those hold promise forscientific study.   Fusion has long been touted as the possible energy source of thefuture. It would be clean because it produces virtually none of theradioactive waste associated with the fission reaction of nuclearpower plants, and would be plentiful because the basic fuel wouldcome from water.   But Norman Hackerman, a National Academy of Sciences member whoco-chaired the conference, told the final session, ``Few of us, ifany, look upon this source as a viable source of power.''   Steven E. Jones, a Brigham Young University researcher whosecold fusion experiments have measured low rates of neutrons, alsosaid he does not believe cold fusion will be a power source.   ``It's a rose, not a tree,'' Jones said. ``It's not going togive us energy, but it is beautiful.''   The cold fusion concept announced by University of Utah chemistStanley Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann on March 23stirred the scientific world with its very simplicity.   The researchers said they produced a fusion reaction in a simpleapparatus. They ran electrical current through electrodes ofpalladium and platinum in a jar of heavy water, which is made withan isotope of hydrogen called deuterium.   Pons and Fleischmann reported the release of heat which theyattributed to nuclear fusion. They backed down from original claimsthey measured gamma rays, but have claimed subsequent experimentsyielded up to 10 times more energy than was consumed.   The two researchers did not attend this week's conference.   Papers presented by researchers at Texas Aandamp;M University, BrighamYoung, Los Alamos National Laboratory and others reported measuringneutrons or gamma rays or the presence of tritium, but no excessheat.   One group led by Robert A. Huggins of Stanford Universityreported heat, but did not test for the presence of nuclearbyproducts.   Others, such as California Institute of Technology, found noindications of heat or nuclear processes.</TEXT></DOC>
