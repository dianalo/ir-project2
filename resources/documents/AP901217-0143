(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Law enforcement officers fired at two16-year-old escapees from a juvenile home, killing one and woundingthe other during a high-speed chase through the Yakima IndianReservation on Monday, authorities said.   The teen-agers had escaped Friday from a juvenile detentioncenter in Tacoma, stolen a car and traveled to the Yakima area,about 160 miles away, said Pierce County sheriff's spokesman CurtBenson.   Yakima County Prosecutor Jeff Sullivan, who conducted apreliminary investigation, said the shootings appeared justifiable.   ``Officers had been advised that these individuals wereconsidered to be armed and dangerous,'' Sullivan said. ``Theyapparently told someone they would not be taken alive and wouldshoot at police.''   One firearm was found in the youths' car, he said.   Authorities encountered the youths after spotting the stolenvehicle Monday morning at a convenience store. Shots were fired anda high-speed chase began, Sullivan said. It was not clear if theyouths shot at officers, Sullivan said.   Yakima County sheriff's officers and Yakima tribal police chasedthe youths' vehicle about 30 miles, shooting at the car in anattempt to stop it, Sullivan said.   A Yakima County sheriff's statement said sheriff's Sgt. MaxJames and Yakima tribal officer Ross Sockzehigh were involved inthe chase and shootings. Both likely will be suspended with paypending an investigation, Sullivan said. Both youths, whose nameswere withheld because of their ages, had a criminal history in theTacoma area, Benson said. He did not elaborate.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is joining the investigationbecause the shootings occurred on an Indian reservation.   Yakima is in the center of the state.
