It placed an order forpontoon causeways, which are simple, low-tech affairs --essentially boxlike metal cans strung together to floatbetween ship and shore.   Then came trouble. Although the pontoon contractor hadcharged plenty, it fell far behind schedule. Worse, the endproduct flunked specs. The square corners of the cans keptdiverging from a true 90-degree angle, and the bolt holes didnot line up; only months later was it found that the factoryfloor had not been level. Workers had tried to bang theobjects into shape with a sledgehammer.</LP><TEXT>   Switch suppliers? No chance: The manufacturer was &quot;wired&quot;politically. So the Navy went right on buying from WedtechCorp. in New York's depressed lower Bronx.   As reporter Marilyn Thompson tells it in &quot;Feeding theBeast: How Wedtech Became the Most Corrupt Little Company inAmerica&quot; (Scribners, 325 pages, $22.50), John Mariotta andFred Neuberger had been running a little tool-and-die shopwhen Mr. Neuberger stumbled across the 8(a) program of racialpreference in federal contracting. What a boon]   &quot;Do you mind being a minority?&quot; he asked his partner.&quot;What do you mean, minority?&quot; Mr. Mariotta shot back. &quot;PuertoRican.&quot; &quot;I am Puerto Rican. What are you talking about?&quot;   He learned quickly enough. The setaside program, a crossbetween affirmative action and industrial policy, enabled theonce-obscure company to grab contract after contract from anoften reluctant Pentagon, swelling from revenue of $1.5million a year in 1978 to $117 million in 1985. As the&quot;model&quot; client of the federal Small Business Administration,it also got heaps of grants and loan guarantees, along withhelp from local governments.   Wedtech played its hard-luck Bronx location for maximumsymbolic value, giving off the odor of sanctity the way somemagazines give off perfume from scent strips. Mr. Mariottakept asserting, quite implausibly, that he had saved itsentire (largely immigrant) work force from the welfare rolls,and thus was doing society a favor by taking set-aside work.   Almost at once the company embarked on an audacious careerof forgeries, perjuries and briberies. From a phony billingscheme, based on applying Wite-Out to genuine invoices, itgraduated to cooking of books and stock manipulation.   Members of Congress made themselves helpful. At one pointNew York Democratic Congressman Mario Biaggi demanded anastounding 5% of any contract revenue he helped steer thefirm, on top of stock. Wedtech forked over $50,000 to afamily law firm to have the chairman of the House SmallBusiness Committee quash an investigation, and later paidanother $50,000 for a promise to have him start a probe of arival firm. Ethics charges were a favorite weapon againstthose who stood in Wedtech's way.   The firm was likewise adept at deploying those otheruncontrolled forms of modern armament, lawsuits and biascharges. It sued Ms. Thompson and her newspaper, the New YorkDaily News, and menaced Barron's over a critical editorial.Wedtech lobbyist E. Robert Wallach charged that by breakingthe corruption story the press had jeopardized hundreds ofminority jobs and had thus shown itself to be racist.   Mr. Wallach, fatefully, also sought to amplify the firm's&quot;general ally structure&quot; by exploiting an old and closefriendship with Attorney General Edwin Meese, his politicalantipode but apparently an indulgent listener. And the firmhired a lobbyist with Reagan White House connections, whichmay have been its undoing.   &quot;SBA officials were accustomed to being strong-armed&quot; byCongress and local officials, but &quot;White House interest wasvirtually unheard of,&quot; writes James Traub in anothertreatment of this shabby saga, &quot;Too Good to Be True: TheOutlandish Story of Wedtech&quot; (Doubleday, 370 pages, $21.95).   Throughout, Wedtech was suffused with a sense ofgrievance, &quot;a sense of injured merit,&quot; as Mr. Traub puts it.Merit? If not superior competence, what kind of merit?Incredibly, Wedtech insiders felt a moral superiority, asvictims deserving redress from an unfair society. Theysquandered fortunes gambling and ordering Mercedeses by thesix-pack, yet went on swearing they were &quot;sociallydisadvantaged.&quot;   Full of lurid situations and ripe frauds, the Wedtechaffair is not entirely well served by either of the twobooks. Ms. Thompson's great virtue is that (after a shaky,clumsy opening) she hews closely to the plot line. Eventsunfold at a smart clip and the reader grasps the overallshape of the story.   While Ms. Thompson holds back from guessing at the widermeaning of it all, Mr. Traub keeps halting the action todeliver op-ed pieties about the Reagan years as an era ofgreed. Yet he does a fine job describing how the slush fundworked and how the prosecutors built their case.   Oddly, Mr. Traub seems to blame this disaster ofuncompetitive procurement on laissez-faire politics, a thesisthat itself cannot be made to float except by pounding thematerial with a mallet. In point of fact, free-marketReaganites tried to abolish the Wedtech-promoting SBA andEconomic Development Administration, and some of the bolderones questioned the setaside program. Soldiers who entrusttheir lives to the quality of American military equipment mayquestion it too.   ---   Mr. Olson is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institutefor Policy Research.</TEXT></DOC>
