A multigroup method isused to obtain the distribution functions for the fusion products andtheir recoils. It is shown that an adequate treatment of the slowing-downprocess, especially the consideration of NES and of the slowing-downtime delay, is essential for an accurate prediction of the dynamic behaviourand the thermal instability of plasmas. NES enhances the thermal instabilityand accelerates the temperature excursion from the equilibrium. The inclusionof NES results in a 20-30 keV increase in the critical temperature forthermal stability. (author). 33 refs, 7 figs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
