But Saudi Arabia, the OPEC kingpin, made it clear it won'tgo along with any such strategy that means new outputreductions.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Saudi Arabia will not cut its production,&quot; said ShishamNazer, the oil minister.   Instead, Saudi delegates to the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries hold the position that OPEC productionshould be raised to meet the expected increase in demand forits oil in the fourth quarter. And yesterday, before themeeting of the oil ministers began, Mr. Nazer emphaticallyrestated his previous position that the kingdom will produceas much as 8.5 million barrels a day, whatever OPEC's totaloutput or production ceiling may be.   &quot;It's not a quota,&quot; he said, of the 8.5 million. &quot;It's aproduction level.&quot;   OPEC temporarily abandoned its quota system last year,after the Persian Gulf crisis began. Saudi Arabia increasedproduction to 8.5 million barrels a day during the crisis tohelp make up for losses of oil formerly exported from Iraqand Kuwait. Then, earlier this year, after the Persian GulfWar, Saudi Arabia agreed to cut back to eight million on theunderstanding it would eventually return to the higher level.   The talks of the oil ministers, which began last night andwill resume today are intended to establish a fourth-quarterproduction level for OPEC that may have apparentlyconflicting purposes. The new production strategy is toprovide for the reentry of Iraq and Kuwait into world oilmarkets. But also, it would be designed to advance theaverage OPEC price toward a year-old target of $21 a barrelfrom the current $19.24.   Mr. Nazer said that Saudi Arabia still is committed to the$21 reference price, &quot;if the market decides that.&quot; But Saudidelegates also maintained that prices could shoot up too farand too fast if OPEC didn't allow production to meetanticipated demand.   OPEC still has a temporary production ceiling of 22.3million barrels a day on its books that has been largelyignored in recent months. Actual output now is around anear-capacity 23.5 million although Iraq and Kuwait areproducing only relatively modest amounts. Still, demand hasbeen climbing, and estimates for the need for OPEC output inthe fourth quarter range from less than 23 million barrels aday to as high as 24 million to 25 million. But someministers claim demand could be far less than that and objectto suggestions the production ceiling might be raised to 24.5million.   Still, most of the ministers believe OPEC should continueto have a production ceiling to curb excess output next year,when demand for oil slackens seasonally. But they suggest itshould be more realistic, reflecting actual output.   Also, it must allow space for Iraqi and Kuwaiti oilexports to grow. Iraq is likely to export between 500,000 andone million barrels a day under the United Nations resolutionthat permits it to sell some oil for humanitarian reasons.That would be in addition to current domestic production of500,000 barrels a day. Kuwait's production is expected todouble by year end to more than 400,000 barrels a day.   Iran, meanwhile, is lobbying for a plan it will offer herethat would set a new production ceiling near the level ofdemand. It would include estimated volumes for Iraq andKuwait. That could result in an overall increase in OPECproduction. &quot;We think it would be around 24 million barrels aday,&quot; said an Iranian delegate.   Even so, some leading producers would have to cut backfrom current levels under Iran's suggestion; these would bethe ones that increased production the most during thePersian Gulf crisis. Iran is among these four or fivecountries. But Saudi Arabia would shoulder the biggest cut.   Despite Saudi Arabia's objections, the Iranians areconvinced their plan would get the OPEC price up to $21 abarrel by the end of the year. Some other delegates were morecautious. If demand is expected to be 24 million barrels aday, said an Indonesian delegate, the ceiling should be &quot;alittle less to get the price up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
