Concerned about flagging interest in its desk-topcomputers, Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., ismoving to juice up its eight-year-old Macintosh system. At ameeting last week in which Apple showed off new features itplans to add to the Macintosh in coming months and years,Apple executives said they saw no reason why Macintoshsoftware would not thrive on the kind of advanced hardwarethey had once said was ideal for future system-software,code-named &quot;Pink,&quot; that is being developed by Taligent Inc.,a company jointly-owned by Apple and IBM.</LP><TEXT>   And the Apple executives pointedly asserted that theywould not &quot;restrain&quot; improvements in the Macintosh, even ifit meant making Taligent's job more difficult.   The mood at Apple raises the specter of &quot;a fratricidal warbetween Macintosh and Taligent,&quot; said one observer with closeties to Apple. Originally, Taligent was an internal Appleproject, and the company's staff of about 180 still consistsalmost entirely of Apple veterans.   The outcome could be eerily similar to the conflictgenerated by Microsoft Corp.'s development of both theWindows command system and, in partnership with IBM, anoperating system called OS/2. The Windows software greatlyboosted the usefulness of Microsoft's original DOS operatingsystem, hurting the market for OS/2, making IBM angry andeventually causing Microsoft to end the OS/2 partnership.   The tension is a sign that Taligent's ambitions, onceformidable, may be foreshortened. When Apple and IBM inked awide-ranging partnership five months ago, executives from thetwo companies talked about creating a common layer ofsoftware, Pink, that would allow future IBM and Applecomputers to run the same applications, which they currentlycan't do.   &quot;Now Pink is a sideshow,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, editor of PCLetter, in Belmont, Calif.   Mr. Alsop said it seems apparent today that Apple allieditself with IBM in order to gain a supply of an advanced IBMmicroprocessor called Power PC, which obtains performancegains through an increasingly popular design technique called&quot;reduced instruction set computing,&quot; or Risc. &quot;Power PC iswhat Apple wanted out of the deal,&quot; he said.   Some analysts question whether Apple isn't simplypretending to de-emphasize Pink to protect current Macintoshsales, even though Pink isn't likely to hit the market untillate next year or later. A spokesman for IBM, meanwhile, alsodownplayed Pink's prospects, saying it never was meant toreplace OS/2, the system software IBM introduced five yearsago and is revamping once again in a bid to distinguish itsPCs from less-expensive clones.   &quot;Any hint that Pink is going to take over (from Macintoshand OS/2) can be dramatically bad for both companies in theshort run,&quot; said Charles Wolf, an analyst at First BostonCorp.   John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer, said thecompany still sees an important role for Taligent. But hedescribes Pink as a rival, not to the Macintosh, but to Unix,an operating system used in high-end computer workstationsmade by other companies.   Mr. Sculley said Pink will help big corporations customizeapplications in ways &quot;that cannot be solved by conventionaloperating systems today.&quot; But critics say this market isquite small and they point to the modest sales of Next Inc.,which has targeted custom applications with an operatingsystem called NextStep that seems to embody the promise ofPink.   Even executives at Taligent, which opened its doors lastmonth after receiving antitrust clearance from the FederalTrade Commission, is backtracking from the promise ofcreating a new standard that would subsume the Macintosh andOS/2 systems. They say they intend to make it &quot;possible&quot; forPink to work with Macintosh and OS/2.   &quot;The current plan is that both Apple and IBM will take onthe responsibility&quot; of making the two operating systems workwith Pink, said Joseph Guglielmi, Taligent's chief executiveand formerly a senior IBM executive.   Apple badly wants to bust out of its niche in the personalcomputer world. The Macintosh accounts for about 15% of PCunit sales, up substantially from two years ago when Applesharply lowered prices but still well behind the overwhelmingleader, PCs that run Microsoft's DOS.   Last week, Apple disclosed specifics on how it plans tobolt the Macintosh operating system, which controls the basicoperations of a computer, onto Risc-based machines due outbeginning in late 1993. By hitching the Macintosh to IBM'sadvanced Power PC processors, Apple says it can extend thelife of its bellwether family through the end of the decade.   &quot;Most of the world has misunderstood Apple's strategy: Thecompany is not dependent on a new operating system to bringthe Macintosh to Risc,&quot; said Michael Slater, editor ofMicroprocessor Report, in Sebastopol, Calif.   At the same time, Apple said it plans to intensifyefforts, begun last year, to convince owners ofDOS-compatibles to purchase Macintosh add-on software that,among other things, would mix sound and images inapplications. The company also is trying to wrest away partof the DOS standard from Microsoft by outfitting itshot-selling notebook computers with the capability ofhandling DOS files.   Extending the reach of Macintosh may push Apple intouncharted territory. In the past, the company has createdalmost all of its own basic software, but in the future itmay rely more on outsiders. One possibility Apple executivesrecently have discussed among themselves: buying SiliconGraphics Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., maker of computersused by engineers and scientists that are renowned for makingcolor images appear in three-dimensions. Apple's own effortsin 3-D graphics are modest, and some executives argue thatthe Macintosh could be made more compelling with the help ofSilicon Graphics.   Apple has never made a major acquisition -- at its currentstock price, Silicon Graphics would cost more than $1.5billion -- but the deal is supported by some Apple executiveswho think the Macintosh would greatly benefit from aninjection of Silicon Graphics' 3-D technology. However,Silicon Graphics isn't likely to welcome a deal. About a yearago, the company turned down a purchase offer from CompaqComputer Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
