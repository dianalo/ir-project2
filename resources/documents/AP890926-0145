Martin Fitzpatrick, administrator of the department's Office ofTransportation, said the number and mileage of small railroadsbegan to increase in the 1970s but gained a full head of steam inthe mid-1980s.   As for the future, he said that ``growth in the local andregional railroad movement probably will be determined by theoutcome of court rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branchline sales and in transactions that create new railroads.''   Since the Staggers Act of 1980, which eased the way for big railcompanies to sell off unprofitable branch lines, nearly 200 smallrailroads have been formed, the report said. A fifth of these areowned by shippers.   ``Local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15percent of the nation's rail system, or 30,000 miles, and employ30,000 people,'' the report said. ``Last year, these carriersgenerated $1.5 billion in revenues.''   Small railroads are freight lines that earn less than $20million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track.   The report said that as much as 25,000 additional miles of railline are expected to be cast off by large railroads before they arefinished with restructuring plans. Eighteen thousand miles are tobe sold to small railroads over the next two years.   ``These carriers will function primarily as feeder linesoriginating in rural agricultural regions and funneling trafficinto the national rail network,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
