The appointment, which was expected, was announced in Dublin by Prime Minister Charles Haughey.    Mr. MacSharry, considered the architect of Ireland's economic recovery over the past two years, will assume his post in January when a new EC Commission is formed. It isn't clear what responsibilities he will assume, though Irish sources said he has made it clear he would like to be put in charge of the important agriculture portfolio.    EC officials said several names are being considered for the agriculture post. Commission President Jacques Delors is holding talks with the 15 men and two women who will make up the new team, but final decisions on assignments could come as late as January.    The new group will carry the EC through 1992, by which time the 12-nation community hopes to have eliminated internal trade barriers.    Mr. Sutherland has been in charge of the EC's increasingly high-profile competition policy. He said in a statement that he expected to return to private life, where he would &quot;work for the cause of European union.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
