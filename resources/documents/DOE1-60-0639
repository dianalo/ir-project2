The first was how to searchfor a standard neutral Higgs, H{sup 0}, in the intermediate mass range,2,m/sub t/andless; m/sub H/andless; 2m/sub W/. The only method not obviously swampedby background is H{sup 0} production in association with W/sup +-/, withH{sup 0}{yields}tt-bar and W{yields}iota{nu}. However, this strategyputs great demands on the ability to identify t-quarks efficiently. Thesecond problem addressed was the detectability of H{sup 0} in the massrange 200 to 400 GeV. The question of signal versus background for afusion-produced H{sup 0} was reexamined. Heavy H{sup 0} production inassociation with a Z{sup 0} was also studied. The fusion process, withH{sup 0} decay to W/sup +/W/sup -/ or Z{sup 0}Z{sup 0}, remains by farthe most promising way to look for a heavy Higgs scalar.</TEXT></DOC>
