For H.J. Heinz Co., Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. is the big fish that got away.    As a result of the federal government's antitrust concerns, Heinz announced Friday its merger agreement with Bumble Bee was terminated.    Heinz already owns the Star-Kist brand, the leader in domestic canned tuna, with a 40% share of the $1 billion-a-year-market. The acquisition of Bumble Bee, the No. 3 producer, would have given Heinz a total of about 55% of the canned tuna market.    In May, the government said it would seek to block the merger, asserting that the proposed transaction &quot;would substantially increase concentration&quot; in the industry.    A spokesman for the Justice Department's antitrust unit said it hadn't taken any further steps in trying to prevent the merger.    However, a Heinz spokesman said the company had been analyzing its options since the government took its stand and concluded, &quot;There was no way we could proceed.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Heinz's stock closed at $39.75, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
