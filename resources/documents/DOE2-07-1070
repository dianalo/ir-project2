In a series of 100 such patients, 98%had associated deep white matter infarcts. Capillary endothelial cellsin the basal ganglia are the primary sites for the uptake of iron, whichis subsequently transported along axons to sites of utilization in thecortex. The low signal intensity is therefore attributed to focal irondeposition in furruginated neurons secondary either to local infarctionor to infarction in the deep white matter.</TEXT></DOC>
