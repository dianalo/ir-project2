It is established, that treatment with hydrogendoes not provide full conversion of ruthenium in a metal state due toincreased thermal stability of surface ruthenium oxides. Stabilizationcentres of insulated ruthenium ions in tetrahedral and octahedral coordinationare lattice vacancies and six-member rings of (SiO/sub 4/)/sub 6/. Treatmentwith oxigen leads to full oxidation of the applied ruthenium. Here, withRu/SiO/sub 2/ system mainly RuO/sub 2/ particles are formed, and withinRu/Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ system - oxide compound of RuO/sub 2/ type and surfacecompound of (Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/)/sub x/RuO/sub 2/ binary oxide type.</TEXT></DOC>
