By a 4-1 vote, the Fed board agreed to cut its discountinterest rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5% from 6%.The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges on loans tofinancial institutions -- is largely symbolic. But inconjunction with the move, the Fed also quietly lowered itstarget for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75%from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed's move followed several days of internationalmeetings at which the Bush administration argued vehementlybut unsuccessfully for global interest-rate cuts. PresidentBush was quick to praise the Fed's action, saying it was&quot;very good news&quot; and showed &quot;a very strong leadership role bythe Fed.&quot;   The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration hasbegun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fedchairman when his term expires in August. Some administrationofficials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady andWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been criticalof Mr. Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cutrates. But administration officials said Mr. Bush's praiseyesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Mr.Greenspan.   Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say theboard has been debating the rate-cutting move for severalweeks. Mr. Greenspan and Fed Governor David Mullins are saidto have become increasingly concerned about signs ofcontinued weakness among manufacturers. But Governors WayneAngell, John LaWare and Edward Kelley were all reluctant tomove.   Messrs. LaWare and Kelley finally agreed to the rate cutyesterday, but Mr. Angell dissented.   In the international financial meetings Sunday and Monday,Mr. Brady called for rate cuts in Japan and Germany, as wellas in the U.S. But the Fed's unilateral move isn't expectedto lead to interest rate action in either country. HorstKoehler, state secretary in Germany's finance ministry,praised the Fed move, saying it is what German officialswanted. But he rejected any suggestion that it might promptthe Bundesbank to ease credit. &quot;For the time being there's nopossibility to say we can lower interest rates,&quot; Mr. Koehlertold reporters.   Mr. Brady, however, said in an interview yesterday that hestill believes &quot;there is ample room for lower interestrates.&quot;   The Fed normally moves the discount rate when it wants tosignal major changes in policy; it uses the federal fundsrate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to each other,for more modest adjustments. Yesterday's action, however, wasunusual: The Fed wanted to engineer a small cut in thefederal funds rate, but was forced to cut the discount ratefirst in order to prevent the federal funds rate fromdropping below it. The Fed usually keeps the funds ratehigher than the discount rate, and Fed officials feared anychange in that practice would confuse people in the financialmarkets.   The discount rate is set solely by the Fed governors inWashington. But the more important funds rate is set by theFederal Open Market Committee, which includes the governorsplus five of the 12 regional Fed presidents from outside ofWashington.   In recent months, Mr. Greenspan has been under criticismfrom several regional presidents, who argue that he exceededhis authority earlier this year to alter the funds ratetarget between meetings of the committee. The Fed chairmanskirted that issue yesterday by cutting the funds rate only aquarter percentage point; the directive adopted by thecommittee at its last meeting on March 26 gave him theauthority to cut the rate that much, but no more.   Fed officials say that Mr. Greenspan informed the regionalFed presidents by telephone of his plans before actingyesterday, but that he didn't seek formal approval of theopen market committee.   The Fed's latest action should provide at least a smallboost to the economy in the coming months. Michael Boskin,President Bush's economic adviser, said the rate cuts &quot;shouldprovide a welcome stimulus and some insurance that therecovery will begin sooner and be more secure.&quot;   Some financial market participants were surprised by thetiming of the Fed's move, because it didn't come on the heelsof any big economic news. Fed officials, however, say thesteady drumbeat of discouraging news in recent weeks -- suchas slow auto sales and a sharp drop in orders for big-ticketdurable goods -- finally convinced them to act. Fed officialsalso were eager to act before the beginning of the Treasury'squarterly note and bond sales, scheduled to be announcedtoday.   Mr. Angell reportedly voted against the move because hewas afraid Fed easing might increase worries about inflationand cause bond traders to drive up interest rates onlong-term bonds. He believes the best way to ensure aneconomic recovery is to bring down long-term interest rates,which affect the housing market, rather than reducingshort-term rates.   But the bond markets, at least yesterday, were encouragedby the Fed's move, and long-term rates declined.   Two of the seven seats on the Fed board currently arevacant. White House economist Lawrence Lindsey has beennominated by President Bush to fill one of those seats buthasn't yet been confirmed by the Senate. Susan Phillips,former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,is the leading candidate to fill the other seat.   ---   Peter Truell contributed to this article.
