<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0550 </DOCNO><TEXT>The project is divided into the following technical tasks. These tasksaddress each of the primary steps in the path form radioactive releasesto dose estimates: source terms; environmental transport; environmentalmonitoring data; demographics, agriculture, and food habits; and environmentalpathways and dose estimates. The source terms will develop estimatesof radioactive emissions from Hanford facilities since 1944. These estimateswill be based on historical measurements and production information.The environmental transport task will reconstruct the movement of radioactivematerials from the areas of release to populations. Movement via theatmosphere, surface water (Columbia River), and ground water will bestudied. the environmental monitoring task will assemble, evaluate, andreport historical environmental monitoring data. A major effort of thistask is to separate Hanford as a source of radionuclide concentrationsin the environment from concentrations due to natural sources and nucleartesting fallout. The demographics, agriculture, and food habits taskwill develop the data needed to determine the populations that couldhave been affected by the releases. Population and demographic informationwill be developed for the general population within the study area. Thisinformation will also be developed for several special population groupsincluding the Native American Tribes in the study area, Army personnelstationed at Hanford, Hanford construction workers, and migrant farmworkers.</TEXT></DOC>
