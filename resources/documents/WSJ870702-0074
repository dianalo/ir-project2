Those who survive 11 grueling weeks of training and ritual will share in two centuries of fierce Marine pride and heroism in combat.    And each will share as well in the more recent legacy: one of tragedy, confusion and even shame.    In what otherwise has been a golden decade of fatter weapons budgets and an influx of better-educated recruits, Marine pride has been shaken by a succession of body blows that are forcing a critical reevaluation of the leathernecks' historical hit-the-beaches role.    &quot;There's no question that the Marine Corps has had one of the worst times in its history,&quot; says Rep. Daniel Mica (D., Fla.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. &quot;Anyone who has looked at the recent record of the Marines has to have questions about whether this is coincidental or endemic.&quot;    In the most recent, and most shocking, development, four Marines assigned to embassy security posts in Moscow have been charged with fraternizing with Russian women linked to the KGB. One Marine is alleged to have passed on government security secrets.    Meantime, Lt. Col. Oliver North, once seen as the embodiment of Marine courage and dedication, is under investigation for possibly illegal efforts to funnel money to the Nicaraguan Contras. And the Corps is still recovering from the deaths of 220 Marines killed while on a peacekeeping mission in Beirut in 1983 when a kamikaze terrorist drove a 5,000-pound truck-bomb into their barracks.    As a result, &quot;the Marine Corps today is in the midst of a long-term and painful transition,&quot; says retired Maj. Gen. Fred Haynes, now an LTV Corp. vice president.    A major challenge will be to restore the Marine esprit de corps, which has been especially bruised by the Moscow embassy scandal. &quot;The cartoons are the worst,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Walter Boomer, formerly the commander of the Marine Security Battalion and now the Corps's public-affairs director. Standing near a painting of the Iwo Jima memorial, he grimaces over a drawing that replicates the contour of the famous Marine icon but substitutes bikini-clad women raising a uniformed security guard.    Behind such angst are broader worries. &quot;The Marines don't like to get black eyes,&quot; says Brig. Gen. James Mead, who commands Marine air bases on the East Coast. But harder to live with, he adds, is the question that increasingly haunts the Marine leadership: &quot;Could there be some complacency in the organization?&quot;    The painful examination of who the Marines are, how they are trained and how they are used is already under way. Later this summer, Navy Secretary James Webb, himself a Marine war hero, and newly named Marine Commandant Lt. Gen. Alfred Gray, are expected to complete a plan to refocus the Marine role for the decades ahead. &quot;We've got to take all our blinders off,&quot; Gen. Boomer says.    The Pentagon isn't saying what is in store, but many current and retired Marines foresee changes that will move the Corps beyond its classic mission of assaulting beachheads. &quot;The last big opposed landing took place at Inchon nearly 40 years ago,&quot; says retired Gen. Haynes. &quot;The Marines should serve more and more as an all-purpose force in readiness, moving rapidly to trouble spots across the world.&quot;    Amphibious assaults probably will remain a prime focus, however. New equipment includes, for example, air-cushion vehicles that can zip across the water at 40 knots, while lugging 60 tons of equipment, and then chug across land.    Indeed, one problem may be that the Marines' unique combat training doesn't equip them to undertake the ambiguous peacetime endeavors they are more often assigned these days. &quot;The nature of the Marine Corps is war-fighting,&quot; says Lt. Gen. Joseph Hoar, who runs the vast Parris Island training complex. &quot;That's what Marines are trained first and foremost to do.&quot;    Moreover, the Marines face bureaucratic resistance in shaping any new mission. They have historically had to battle the three other services just to preserve their role, let alone expand it. The Corps is considerably smaller than any of the other services -- it has about 200,000 uniformed personnel, vs. the Navy's 450,000, the Air Force's 500,000 and the Army's 750,000 -- but it combines aspects of all three.    Marines travel on Navy ships, but fight on the ground, while operating an independent air force that is the world's fourth largest. The Air Force has repeatedly suggested that it take control of the Marine airlift functions, and the Army doesn't want the Marines to assume soldiering tasks it handles. Meanwhile, a newly established command for special-operations groups, like the Green Berets, is training forces to undertake some of the quick-strike missions that Marines believe they could handle.    Inside the Pentagon, Marines are viewed both as a proud elite and a paranoid minority. &quot;Most Marines, by the time they're officers, feel that if they're not careful, someone will put them out of business,&quot; says Allan Millett, a Marine historian and head of a Marine reserve training unit.    Over the years, the Marines have thwarted no fewer than 18 attempts to put them out of existence. While securely built into the military structure, Marines aren't always appreciated as much as they feel they should be. &quot;What are they for?&quot; asks one Pentagon planner who asks not to be identified. &quot;What can they do that somebody else can't do?&quot;    Influential backers in the past have thwarted political assaults on the Corps. President Truman, who sought to pare the Marines' mission in the 1950s, dropped the effort after observing that the Corps &quot;has a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's,&quot; a reference for which he later apologized.    Certainly, any effort today to merge the Marines into another service or pare their role would meet a formidable lobbying force of current and former Marines. They include Treasury Secretary James Baker, Secretary of State George Shultz and Navy Secretary Webb, as well as such senior lawmakers as Sens. John Glenn (D., Ohio) and John Warner (R., Va.).    Since 1947, the Marines have been protected by a legislative charter providing for four divisions to carry out amphibious assaults and &quot;such other duties as the president may direct.&quot;    This open-ended mission may provide a safety valve for the Marines in case the amphibious missions are ever deemed to be an anachronism. But the charter also may have saddled the Marines with the hodgepodge of tasks that aren't consistent with their training.    Following the Beirut disaster, Commandant Gen. P.X. Kelley told Congress, &quot;Our basic mission is 'presence,' and the logical question is how do you define 'presence.' . . . Let me tell you that 'presence' is a mission that's not in any military dictionary.&quot;    &quot;We were scratching our heads,&quot; recalls Gen. Mead, who led the initial detachment into Lebanon. &quot;We're supposed to be assaulting, but here we got a mission where we're supposed to be a presence for peacekeeping.&quot; Local Marine authorities later assigned to the mission were criticized for making an already bad situation worse by packing so many men into a single, relatively unprotected area.    When Marines are serving outside the Corps, loose supervision is considered to be a problem. Col. North, for example, encountered an ambiguous chain of command at the National Security Council, with only sporadic intervention from his superiors. Similarly, Marines assigned to the State Department at the Moscow embassy had far less supervision than they would have in other Marine assignments.    The security-guard scandal is complicated by questions surrounding the military's subsequent investigation of the matter. Charges that two Marines helped Soviet agents walk through parts of the embassy have been dropped. Congress's General Accounting Office is about to begin an inquiry into whether the investigation was mismanaged.    Mr. Millett, the Marine historian, thinks that, with the emphasis on combat-related tasks, the Marines aren't well-suited for the often-tedious embassy security jobs. &quot;I think they ought to look seriously at abolishing the program,&quot; he says.    The Marine leadership would consider any such move a blow. Besides, they argue, embassy guards sometimes have to fight. Eleven Marines have been killed in such guard duty, eight wounded and 13 captured or taken hostage. &quot;The job itself isn't one of simply standing there in your dress blues looking pretty,&quot; says Gen. Boomer. &quot;It's a deadly serious job.&quot;    ---   Marines in the '80s   Budget*   Fiscal 1981 $4.4 billion     Fiscal 1984          $7.0 billion   Fiscal 1987 $9.1 billion    Marine traumas   Oct. 1983 -- 220 Marines die in Beirut barracks bombing.
