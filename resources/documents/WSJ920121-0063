John Dingell rejected an Israeligovernment proposal that would have severely restricted hisinvestigation of a massive fraud involving U.S. military aidand the Israeli Air Force.   In a letter, the Michigan Democrat notified DefenseMinister Moshe Arens that he wouldn't sign a &quot;lengthycontractual agreement,&quot; which he said was requested by theIsraeli government as a precondition to obtaining itscooperation.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal would have denied Rep. Dingell'sinvestigators access to current and former Israeli governmentemployees, including military and civilian authorities whoinvestigated the fraud, and restricted how investigatorscould use documents the Israeli government agreed to provide.   Israel informed Rep. Dingell that as a policy, it doesn'tpermit foreign authorities to conduct direct interviews withIsraeli employees. The Israeli government proposed, instead,that after receiving questions from the subcommittee, itwould interview the Israelis and pass along their answers tothe panel.   Signing such an agreement &quot;is not the usual practice&quot; ofhis House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight andInvestigations, Mr. Dingell wrote to Mr. Arens, &quot;as it wouldunduly restrict the ability of the subcommittee to dischargeits responsibilities.&quot; He emphasized, however, that his panelwould work with Israel to resolve &quot;all reasonable concernsyour government may have.&quot;   Subcommittee investigators are probing the activities ofan Israeli Air Force general, Rami Dotan, who was stripped ofhis rank and imprisoned last year for skimming millions ofdollars in U.S. military aid to Israel. Only a fraction ofthe stolen U.S. funds, which were secretly held inSwitzerland, was spent by Gen. Dotan and his associates,fueling speculation that the diversion was intended tofinance covert operations. A Page One article in The WallStreet Journal yesterday profiled the Dotan affair.   Melvin Rishe, a Washington lawyer who represents theIsraeli government, said yesterday that officials hoped thata signed agreement could still be reached. &quot;I think we willhave further dialogue this week,&quot; he said.   Mr. Rishe said that in the case of the Iran-Contrainvestigations, Israel entered into signed agreements withcongressional committees and with the independent prosecutor.&quot;It is normal in government-to-government {dealings} as a wayof facilitating cooperation,&quot; he said.   In his letter, Rep. Dingell sought to allay Israeliconcerns, saying that his investigators wouldn't discloseclassified information related to Israel's national security.To avoid further delays in his investigation, he urged Israelto provide his subcommittee with reports compiled by civilianand military officers who probed the Dotan affair.</TEXT></DOC>
