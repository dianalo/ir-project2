Elasticwave velocities are obtained from rock cylinders in which delay timesare measured using a pulse transmission technique. The longitudinal andshear velocities and bulk densities allow the calculation of isotropicelastic moduli. Techniques and equipment used for measuring velocitiesas functions of confining pressure, pore pressure, and temperature aresummarized.</TEXT></DOC>
