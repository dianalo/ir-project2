The rating concern cited &quot;diminished near-term financialflexibility&quot; caused by heavy debt resulting from &quot;weakoperating performance&quot; and heavy capital outlays forCaterpillar's factory automation program. Sandamp;P also affirmedthe rating on $5.8 billion of Caterpillar's senior long-termdebt at single-A-minus.
