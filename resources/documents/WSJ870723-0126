But for a half-century the central meaning of these words has been gutted by clever and unprincipled interpretive ruses. Oppressive restrictions on land use have been called &quot;mere regulations&quot; and have been justified, without compensation to the owners.    The Supreme Court hasn't asked the right question: What has the owner lost? Instead, it has contented itself with the far more permissive inquiry: Has the state left the owner any valuable use of his land? This is as if in return for leaving the owner a single slice of his bread, the state should be allowed to take the rest of the loaf.    The upshot is that private-development rights in real estate have been held at the whim of the state -- so long as the state has not been so greedy as to occupy the land itself. Public officials have been afforded this enormous discretion over private property because they were presumed to act not out of selfish or parochial motives but for the benefit of the public.    Another Supreme Court term has just come and gone, and the law of takings is still a shambles. But it is a shambles with a decided difference, both in direction and tone.    In three important cases decided during the term that ended last month, the court showed how it could first zig and then zag. The first of these cases, dealing with mineral rights, continued -- indeed extended -- the old pattern of massive judicial resignation in the face of manifest confiscation. Then came a sharp about-face in two subsequent California land-use cases. These hold out the possibility of a judicial revolution in the takings area, at least as it applies to local governments. Keystone Bituminous Coal Association v. De Benedictis shows the court at its worst. Many years ago Pennsylvania landowners sold the rights to coal beneath their lands to mining companies. The deeds of sale made it explicit that the miners were not responsible for supporting the surface lands; surface owners took the risk that their homes would disappear into the ground in the course of mining operations. In 1966 these surface owners prevailed upon the Pennsylvania legislature to give them back the same support right that they had previously sold, without compensating the coal companies for the lost coal or for the added burdens that these restrictions imposed upon their mining operations.    Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, noted that the coal lost to the mining company was small relative to the vast amounts that could still be mined (at greater expense). Only 27 million tons of coal, out of billions, had to be left in place. In other words, the fresh slice of bread could be taken without compensation, so long as the rest of the stale loaf was left behind.    Justice Stevens argued that the prevention against physical harm was in the classic mode of nuisance-prevention law. Yet in so doing so he wholly inverted the relationship between physical harm and victim consent. Protection against physical harm is surely a proper subject of government concern if the threat is imposed upon strangers. But these harms had been explicitly accepted by the sellers.    The case is simply one in which the state has undone a &quot;done deal&quot; by returning rights to the surface owners while letting them keep the original purchase price. If these rights are worth more to the surface owners than to the miners, then all the more reason the state should pay -- with tax dollars raised by a special assessment from the surface owners. The Constitution requires no less.    First English Evangelical Church v. Los Angeles, and Nollan v. California Coastal Commission take far broader views of the constitutional mandate. First English involves a church summer camp whose buildings had all been destroyed by floods after forest fires had denuded nearby watershed lands. California then restricted all use of the campsite land because it was in a flood plain. The only legal issue before the Supreme Court concerned the remedy for the owner: Was the church entitled only to a lifting of the restriction, as California had previously held, or could it obtain damages for the interim loss of use?    Justice William Rehnquist spoke for the majority when he held that any &quot;temporary taking&quot; required compensation. If the state occupied your home for a month, it would have to pay rental even if it returned the property in spic-and-span order. It has taken a temporal slice of the loaf of bread.    First English applies to all land-use cases. Its implications could be enormous. Before First English settled the point, stringent land-use controls were a no-lose proposition for local governments. If one regulation was struck down, the state could repeal it and impose a different one. The charade could continue until hapless landowners were stripped of their development rights, bit by bit, year by year.    After First English, states will have to pay a high price for strategic delay. This could reduce their ardor for keeping old restrictions in place and adding new ones. The key unresolved question is whether courts, when faced with the prospect of an onslaught of suits, will choose to constrict the types of regulations for which compensation is required so as to prevent First English from ever coming into play.    But wait! Nollan suggests that this line of escape may not be wide open.    The Nollan family wished to rip down their small house and erect a large one on their beach property in Ventura, Calif. The state Coastal Commission was prepared to grant a building permit only if the Nollans gave the public access to the beach. In a decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court ruled that the Coastal Commission's demand for public access was a taking that required compensation. Access to the beach was a condition unrelated to purposes of the building code.    The Supreme Court's decision in Nollan has moved the law on several points. It clearly raises the level of scrutiny imposed upon local governments above its prior moribund levels. It explicitly rejects the time-worn argument that requiring public access was a &quot;mere restriction on use.&quot; And it abandons the attitude of passive deference by noting that local officials are capable of &quot;out and out extortion.&quot;    Still, Justice Scalia did not push hard enough. If the state wants to claim access for the public, then it should have to pay for it from public funds. The construction of an ordinary home along the beach front is hardly a nuisance that can be suppressed without compensation.    As it now stands, Nollan is sure to generate a fair bit of unnecessary confusion as lower courts struggle to interpret it. Until the uncertainty is sorted out, many standard zoning practices are at risk, with, of course, potential liability for interim losses under First English.    For example, can the state permit you to build your subdivision only if you set aside land for a public park? Or, can it permit a new high-rise only if 20% of the space is reserved for low-income families? Read loosely, Nollan need not affect these common practices. Read strictly, it easily could since neither subdivision exactions nor space-occupancy requirements are designed to protect strangers against external threats of harm.    It is perhaps too much to seek in one opinion the needed transformation of land-use law, so Justice Scalia's search for a middle ground may be chalked up as the incremental process of adjudication. But even the uncertainty in Nollan cannot conceal that the Supreme Court is willing today to take a stance on state control of land use that is far tougher than any it took only a year ago. Private property has indeed made something of a comeback. But it is too early to tell whether these two cases mark just a small bend in the road or signal a fundamental shift in its direction.    ---   Mr. Epstein is James Parker Hall law professor at the University of Chicago. </TEXT></DOC>
