On the program is entertainment by a chamber-music group, a five-piece dance band, a folk-dance troupe, a disk jockey and two masters of ceremonies. On the menu are grapefruit sorbet, breast of capon stuffed with wild rice and currants, Greek pastries and Dom Perignon.    The silver candelabra are lighted. The pink candied almonds are in place. The waiters are in their white gloves. Mr. Ernst fusses over the floral arrangements, then issues some last-minute instructions to the help: &quot;Synchronize your watches and don't forget to wait for your cues.&quot; Then he laughs. &quot;Don't I sound just like Cecil B. De Mille?&quot;    Brace yourself, father of the bride. This is a 1987 wedding.    Lavish nuptials are back in vogue. Gone are the barefoot seashore ceremonies, the Khalil Gibran readings, the punch-and-cookie receptions in church basements. Seed pearls are once again in great demand. So are 12-foot trains, flocks of white doves, fleets of limousines and seven-tier wedding cakes with the little brides and grooms on top.    &quot;We're talking eight, nine, even 10 bridal attendants. We're talking ice sculptures, satin gowns and matching hose with embroidered wedding bells on the ankle,&quot; says Teddy Lenderman, a bridal consultant for whom the trend is particularly gratifying. Her business, Bearable Weddings by Teddy, in Terre Haute, Ind., is booming. &quot;Couples want a class act they'll remember for the rest of their lives,&quot; she says.    Class doesn't come cheap. Bride's magazine estimates that the average couple today spends $10,385 on a wedding. For those who want to do it in high style, designer wedding gowns by Pat Kerr in Memphis, Tenn., can run $30,000. The Plaza Hotel in New York is booking weddings for June 1989 at around $250 a plate for the reception dinner; music and flowers are extra.    Why the new emphasis on glamour? For one thing, couples are older. (The Census Bureau figures the average groom is 26 years old, up from 23 in 1976.) Daddy still pays for most first weddings, but more and more couples have established careers and money of their own to spend on nuptial frills.    Then, too, as more couples make their second or third trip to the altar, old notions about discreet civil ceremonies and wedding dresses in colors other than white have fallen by the wayside. &quot;In the dark ages,&quot; says Mr. Ernst, &quot;white signified virginity. Now, it stands for hope and joy.&quot;    Many think the revival of the big wedding reflects an innocent desire to return to the formality, fantasy and frivolity shunned in the 1960s. Others see crass, not class. &quot;It's the merging of social life and business life in America,&quot; says Judith Martin, who, as Miss Manners, writes a syndicated etiquette column. &quot;People put on a wedding as a way to entertain clients. It's horrible.&quot;    Miss Manners is particularly miffed by the letters she gets from brides worried that their friends are too tall, too short, too homely or too pregnant to make attractive bridesmaids. &quot;I tell them to hold auditions,&quot; Ms. Martin says.    It is show biz, after all. At one recent wedding beside a lake in Manhattan's Central Park, consultant Marcy Blum waited, walkie-talkie in hand. As the music from the orchestra began to swell, she signaled a gondolier waiting out of sight behind some trees. Then, to the strains of Handel's &quot;Water Music,&quot; around the bend sailed the bride on her father's arm. &quot;It was pretty spectacular,&quot; says Ms. Blum. &quot;Everybody was floored.&quot;    A recent Long Island wedding had eight flamingos, flown in from Florida, strolling amid tables of hors d'oeuvres. &quot;It's a tropical theme,&quot; the bride explained. At another affair, north of San Francisco, the bride and groom released 500 blue and silver balloons as they left the church.    Weddings are getting bigger. Bridal consultants now consider a small wedding to be one with fewer than 200 guests. Big weddings are those with more than 500. Bridal processions are getting longer, too. Ms. Kerr, the gown designer, says weddings now include as many as six or seven youngsters as attendants. &quot;The little boys wear little knickerbockers,&quot; she says. &quot;They're hysterical.&quot;    Whereas 10 years ago caterer Randall Gottier was making tea sandwiches, crudites and pates for receptions, today, he says, the call is for caviar, smoked salmon and lobster. Baker Madeline Lanciani says some couples are ordering far more wedding cake than they need for their guests, just so the cakes will be tall.    Putting on such a show takes effort and expertise as well as money. Tania Wilk, a New York television producer, says she &quot;started to think in scenes&quot; as soon as she decided to marry. She picked the site for the ceremony, a Victorian mansion, for its spectacular staircase.    Her headpiece was designed by a member of the costume department of the Metropolitan Museum. A florist researched Victorian bouquets and candelabra. A dancing mistress, hired for the occasion, taught guests to do the minuet and the waltz. Ms. Wilk herself paced off the photos professionally and marked proper poses on the floor with gaffer's tape. After the wedding, Ms. Wilk mailed guests their own portraits.    Too harried to organize or orchestrate such spectaculars themselves, more couples are hiring bridal consultants to handle the details. The Association of Bridal Consultants boasts 220 members, up from just one in 1982. (In 1955, it had 2,500.)    Mr. Ernst, the bridal consultant, charges $800 to $1,400 for his services, which include organizing shopping trips for the mother of the bride, taking fabric swatches to the florists for matching, and staging rehearsals, which can last as long as three or four hours.    He is most proud of his artistic touches. For a recent wedding, he designed a dinner salad to match the bridesmaids' bouquets. &quot;These are the little things that matter,&quot; he says. Mr. Ernst says he became a bridal consultant because he is a romantic. &quot;My own mother was married 12 times,&quot; he says. &quot;The first seven or eight were very traditional ceremonies.&quot;    Mothers are making a comeback, too. Career-minded daughters with hectic work schedules and jobs far from home are happy to delegate tasks. Donna Lucas, a Sacramento, Calif., public-relations specialist, says her mother took her wedding responsibilities very seriously.    For months before Ms. Lucas's May wedding, she says, &quot;my mother crashed every big wedding in San Diego just to see how other people were doing it up,&quot; she says. &quot;Every weekend, she'd hit at least two.&quot;    One spectacular find: a 50-member choir hired to sing &quot;Here Comes The Bride.&quot;    For some mothers, the job is harder than for others. Ann Mara, who has 11 children, has married off six of them in six years, planning Plaza Hotel weddings, weddings at country clubs, picking out bridesmaids' dresses and &quot;running back and forth with menus.&quot;    Some of the children who married are sons, whose fiancees did a lot of the work. But the remaining Mara children are girls -- five of them. So there may be five more weddings to plan. &quot;Or five ladders,&quot; says Mrs. Mara, &quot;which may be preferable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
