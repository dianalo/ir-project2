But a fifth day passed with nosign of the party's downed plane.   Four U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters joined the growing fleet ofAmerican and Ethiopian aircraft looking for Leland, D-Texas, and 15others, missing since Monday when their twin-engine airplanedisappeared on a flight to a refugee camp.   The Blackhawks, ferried across the Atlantic from Eglin Air ForceBase in Florida by a C-5 cargo plane, were assembled in Addis Ababaon Friday and took to the air at dawn, joining more than a dozenother aircraft.   John Guerra, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, saidthree more C-130 Hercules cargo planes were to arrive Sunday,supplementing two already taking part in the search that beganTuesday.   The helicopters were dispatched to Ethiopia before Leland'spress secretary in Washington criticized the search effort Fridayas lacking ``a sense of urgency.''   ``There's an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here,''Leland's spokeswoman, Alma Newsom, told a news conference. ``Wecould have and should have located them by now.''   But weary officials in Ethiopia's capital defended their efforts.   ``We feel we have adequate resources,'' said Guerra. ``However,if the requirements of the operation increase, we are prepared toincrease both the equipment and the manpower.''   The twin-engine Twin Otter disappeared Monday on a flight fromAddis Ababa to the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles to the southwestnear the Sudanese border. Leland, chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Hunger, was one of nine Americans aboard the flight.   Earlier this week, weather satellites detected what appeared tobe distress signals from aircraft in two areas outside the Lelandplane's intended flight path, but nothing was found when rescuerssearched those areas.   The C-130s due to arrive Sunday were bringing crews to spell thefliers of the first two Hercules, who have been in the air fromsunup to sundown each day since their arrival on an overnightflight from West Germany on Tuesday.   Guerra described as ``superb'' the cooperation of theEthiopians, with whom the United States has had chilly relationssince a Marxist government came to power in a 1974 coup.   ``The Ethiopians have put up to 10 aircraft up in a day,'' hesaid. ``You got a heck of a lot of people out there looking for themissing aircraft. We've got the local authorities also helping onthe ground.''   The government in Addis Ababa has allowed an American U2, ahigh-altitude reconnaisance craft commonly used for spy missions,to make daily passes over its territory, taking high-resolutionphotographs of the search area.   ``I think there is an honest difference of opinion among peopleequally committed to finding the aircraft,'' said James Haley, theembassy's chief spokesman. ``Rescue people here are deciding onwhat they consider adequate resources.''   Two of Leland's colleagues, Reps. Gary Ackerman and Al Wheat,flew in the fleet of four Blackhawks that spent the day scouringthe first 100 miles of the intended flight path of downed plane.The two C-130s and a number of Ethiopian planes covered theremainder of the path.   Ackerman, a member of Leland's committee, and Wheat, who belongsto the Congressional Black Caucus, were sent to Ethiopia by HouseSpeaker Thomas S. Foley to represent the lower chamber.   Leland has made six trips to Ethiopia, the last one just lastMarch. As chairman of the select committee, he long has expressedintense interest in the problems of Africa's displaced and hungry.   The Fugnido camp is one of four camps in southwestern Ethiopiarun by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It houses more than300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in theirneighboring country.   The eight other Americans traveling with Leland included threemembers of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three officersfrom the U.S. Agency for International Development and the spouseof one of the AID officials. Also aboard were an Ethiopian employeeof the U.S. Embassy, three Ethiopian officials and a crew of three.</TEXT></DOC>
