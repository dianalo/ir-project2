ProsperAvril failed again today to put down a rebellion by troopsstationed near the Presidential Palace.   The U.S. ambassador offered Washington's support for thegovernment which foiled a coup attempt Sunday but has been unableto quell the mutiny.   Rebel soldiers were 200 yards from the Presidential Palace,which was guarded by loyal troops, anti-aircraft guns and cannons.   Witnesses said loyalists killed four mutineers in a street ofthe capital Thursday night, and a diplomat confirmed two of thedeaths. Four other rebel troops have been killed since Sunday.   Streets of this normally bustling capital of 1 million peoplewere deserted this morning under a state of emergency. Stores,schools and offices were closed. Airlines canceled flights intoHaiti's international airport.   Haitians were cut off from developments because radio stationseither were not broadcasting news or were off the air, their cablescut by government troops, apparently for violating militarycensorship imposed by the state of emergency. Cables were cut atRadios Antilles, Inter, Metropole and Liberte.   A grenade thrown Thursday night by rebel troops knocked out thetransmitter tower at the state television station, said newsdirector Annaise Chavanet.   The deep divisions in the military were seen as a sign that moredisorder may be imminent because Haitian soldiers rarely kill eachother.   The rebels are demanding that Avril step down. They accuse thegovernment of favoritism toward the Presidential Guard in pay andliving conditions and of arbitrarily dismissing senior officers ina crackdown on drugs and corruption.   Members of the 400-man Leopards commando unit and troops fromthe 700-man Dessalines barracks, the most repressive unit inHaiti's 7,000-man army, were involved in the mutiny, but it was notknown how many.   The Dessalines Barracks abuts the National Palace, protected bymembers of Avril's 1000-man Presidential Guard.   The nearby U.S. Consulate closed as a security precaution, anofficial said. Its operations were moved to the U.S. Embassy, whichis several blocks away and remained open.   A witness said an armored car carrying loyal soldiers of thePresidential Guard on Thursday night chased a stolen army truckcarrying members of the Leopards unit that shot in the air as theydrove up and down on a road.   The rebels fled into a house and the loyalist troops destroyedit with high-caliber machine gunfire, killing the four and woundingone, said the witness, speaking on condition of anonymity.   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley called on Avril at the palaceand expressed support for his government. ``The United States isreassured by democratization under Avril,'' an embassy statementsaid Thursday.   Since coming to power six months ago in a coup, Avril hasrestored some constitutional rights suspended in 1987 and approvedthe establishment of an electoral council to prepare for elections.   The embassy statement said it ``appears probable'' that Sunday'scoup attempt was organized by exiles linked to ousted dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France in 1986.   Avril's government has imposed military censorship, and mostradio stations abbreviated or canceled newscasts Thursday.   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic station, reported one mankilled and three people wounded in shootings Wednesday and Thursday.   The government has blamed Sunday's coup attempt on a ``vastcampaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption'' that``collided with the interests'' of those who oppose democraticchange.   The United States has made the crackdown a condition for theresumption of $70 million in aid that it suspended after thugskilled 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first freeelections in more than 30 years.   The coup attempt Sunday was foiled when loyal soldiers rescuedAvril as he was being escorted in handcuffs to the airport to bedeported.   Avril, 50, came to power in a coup led by non-commissionedofficers demanding democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsoredviolence. The coup ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.</TEXT></DOC>
