(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The shutdown of plutonium processing at theRocky Flats nuclear weapons plant because of a safety violationfollows repeated complaints by workers, citizens' groups and thegovernment that management had a cavalier attitude toward healthand safety.   Jim Wilson, who heads a state-appointed monitoring commission onradioactive waste at Rocky Flats, called the shutdown Saturdaysymbolic of the Department of Energy's new attention to problems atthe country's aging nuclear weapons plants.   He gave the DOE credit for ``taking the offensive.''   Tom Rauch of Citizens Against Rocky Flats Contamination, agrassroots group formed last year to protest the proposedincineration of radioactive wastes at Rocky Flats, saw the shutdownas a slap at plant management.   ``It simply confirms what many people have said all along _ thatsafety and health problems at the plant are greater than the DOEand Rockwell (International Corp., which operates the plant) havebeen willing to admit,'' he said.   DOE shut down the main plutonium processing room at Rocky Flats,16 miles northwest of Denver. The plant, which employs about 6,000people, uses highly radioactive plutonium to make triggers fornuclear weapons.   Rockwell spokesman Pat Etchart said Tuesday the closure of theprocessing room has had little effect on production at Rocky Flats.   ``We have 100 major buildings out here. If this is short-term,it will have minimal effect on the plant operation. If it is longerterm, yes, it could significantly impact production efforts,'' hesaid.   It was the second major suspension of nuclear weapons productionin two months. Three reactors at the Savannah River Plant in SouthCarolina were shut down in August because of safety concerns.   The DOE has made no plans for either plant to reopen.   The shutdown in Building 771 at Rocky Flats apparently stemsfrom a Sept. 29 incident in which a Rockwell supervisor and twoemployees entered a building without respirators because a warningsign was blocked from view.   Richard W. Starostecki, the deputy assistant energy secretaryfor safety, health and quality assurance, told a Washington newsconference that the decision to close the facility stemmed from anincident on Sept. 29.   A department inspector and two Rockwell employees entered a roomin which workers were cleaning up radioactive contamination but hadnot posted the required warning signs, said Starostecki.   The workers in the room were wearing protective clothing andmasks, but the inspector and the two Rockwell employeers were not,Starostecki said. Two of them had ``positive nasal smears, whichmeans that there was some degree of contamination.''   ``We do not view this as life threatening,'' said Starostecki.``We are trying to quantify the amount of material they might havebreathed in.''   Rocky Flats has been inspected by the DOE three times since1986. The most recent DOE report found pervasive inadequacies inworker protection, fire protection, maintenance and repeatedfailure by Rockwell to address the department's previous concerns.   ``The large number of repeat concerns from previous technicalsafety appraisals of Rocky Flats facilities found in this appraisalraises questions regarding management's full commitment to, and-orinvolvement with safety,'' the report said.   Rockwell spokeswoman Carol Groves said Tuesday the company had``re-emphasized'' safety in the past couple of months and hadrestructured some departments such as radiation monitoring toimprove performance.   ``Safety is the highest priority at this plant,'' she said.``Where there are safety problems, management has to takeresponsibility. It's not that it's lax, but we can always standimprovement.''   Among other recent episodes in the plant's troubled history are:   _ Officials of the United Steel Workers, Local 8031, announcedin March 1987 that safety complaints had jumped nearly sixfold inthe previous five years.   _ A May 1987 DOE report said workers at Rocky Flats wereoperating under questionable safety standards and were performinghazardous jobs without proper guidance. The report capped a federalinvestigation into the death of a Rocky Flats electrician.   _ Rockwell proposed a test burn of radioactive and chemicalwastes at Rocky Flats in early 1987. Mounting public opposition anda lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and Rauch's citizens groupresulted in the DOE shelving the burn pending an environmentalassessment.   _ Allegations that Rocky Flats employees operated a ``modelshop'' there as a sideline and made $1 million worth of gadgets andtrinkets over 17 years.   _ A Feb. 12 DOE study found sloppy work habits, faulty equipmentand lax attitudes at the plant had created ``significant safetyconcerns.''   _ In May, the DOE ripped Rockwell's management, sayinginattentiveness and disorganization had caused safety problems.   _ In late May, radioactive and hazardous material spilled fromseveral defective concrete containers which had deteriorated to theconsistency of mayonnaise, state health officials said.   _ In June, Rockwell was fined for safety violations, includingfailure to report fires and improper handling of stored waste.   _ In June, EPA reported 103 past waste disposal areas at RockyFlats that needed to be cleaned up. A DOE study in July found thegovernment would have to spend more than $900 million there by 1995to comply with safety and health laws and clean up pollution.   _ On July 22, 12 cubic feet of low-level radioactive wastespilled, but plant officials waited a week before reporting it.   _ In August it was revealed that DOE officials earlier hadconsidered shutting down the plant entirely because of repeatedsafety violations and because of Rockwell's managers' andemployees' ``lax attitudes.''</TEXT></DOC>
