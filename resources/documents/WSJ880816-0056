The offer has an indicated value of about C$114.3 million (US$93.7 million). It expires Sept. 14.    Minority holders own about 29% of Calgary-based Canterra and Husky owns about 8%. As previously reported, Husky agreed to acquire the rest of Canterra's 131.3 million shares outstanding, at C$2.78 each, from Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta. Nova currently holds about 12% of Canterra, but will acquire another 51% from Toronto-based Polysar Energy andamp; Chemical Corp. when Nova completes a previously reported agreement to buy all of Polysar's assets. That transaction is expected to close late next month.    Nova indirectly holds a 42.5% stake in closely held Husky. Husky and Canterra are oil and gas producing companies. Nova is a natural-gas pipeline and petrochemical concern. Polysar also produces petrochemicals.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Canterra closed at C$2.94 a share, up two Canadian cents. </TEXT></DOC>
