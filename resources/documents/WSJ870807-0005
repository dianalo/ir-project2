Mr. Wigton &quot;has been asked to rejoin the firm, and he will do that,&quot; Max C. Chapman Jr., Kidder's president, said in an interview yesterday.    Kidder's original decision to suspend Mr. Wigton created widespread unhappiness among the investment banking firm's employees, particularly after the government dropped insider-trading charges against Mr. Wigton and two other prominent Wall Street arbitragers in May. Government prosecutors have said they will seek a wider indictment of the three men.    Thus, the move to reinstate Mr. Wigton is seen as an attempt to boost sagging morale at Kidder, which has been shaken by the insider-trading charges and a sweeping management shake-up ordered by its parent, General Electric Co.    Mr. Chapman said Mr. Wigton will receive back pay and that Kidder will also pay Mr. Wigton's legal bills. However, he said Mr. Wigton &quot;will have no direct managerial responsibility&quot; and will devote his time to his legal defense.    As previously reported, Kidder in June agreed to pay $25.3 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges of civil insider trading and other securities laws violations. The firm neither admitted nor denied guilt. GE also made sweeping changes in Kidder's top management and instituted new controls as part of a successful effort to avoid criminal indictment by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office.    Mr. Chapman wouldn't comment on whether GE had cleared Mr. Wigton's reinstatement with the U.S. Attorney's office.    When Kidder moved last April to suspend Mr. Wigton and stop paying his legal bills, the firm's actions were widely condemned on Wall Street. By contrast, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. continued to employ Robert Freeman, Goldman's head of arbitrage who was indicted on insider-trading charges along with Mr. Wigton and another former Kidder arbitrager, Timothy Tabor. Goldman also continued to pay Mr. Freeman's legal bills. The three men were originally arrested in February and have insisted they are innocent.    Mr. Chapman refused to link Kidder's rehiring of Mr. Wigton to any morale problems at the firm. &quot;We've always believed that Dick Wigton was innocent,&quot; and &quot;we're very happy&quot; to have him back, he said. Mr. Wigton has worked at Kidder for more than 30 years.    Asked why Mr. Wigton hadn't been returned to his old job, Mr. Chapman said: &quot;We aren't in the arbitrage business.&quot; As part of its settlement with the government, Kidder agreed to disband its arbitrage unit.    Mr. Wigton couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
