Outstanding was the last installment on a 25-year, $75million loan to the Japan Highway Public Corp. to finance asegment of highway that runs between Tokyo and Nagoya incentral Japan, a World Bank spokeswoman said. The loan wastaken out at 6% annual interest in 1965.   Between 1953 and 1966, Japan borrowed $862.9 million fromthe World Bank to finance 31 projects, becoming the secondlargest debtor to the bank after India. &quot;The World Bankprovided money during Japan's roughest times,&quot; said SeiichiroYonekura, professor of business history at HitotsubashiUniversity. &quot;Without its help, Japan's postwar recovery wouldhave been inconceivable.&quot;   Japan is now the second-largest contributor after the U.S.to the international loan institution, bearing 6.69% of itstotal shares. The bank also borrows up to one-third of itsfunds in the Tokyo money market.                                                                                                          SHUTDOWN IN ARGENTINA                                                                                                          Twenty branch offices of Argentina's national mortgagebank were closed yesterday, private news agencies reported.The remaining eight branches eventually will be closed andall 2,200 employees laid off, bank director Raul Chaconreportedly said. The closings came without warning to thebank's staff or clients. The government of President CarlosMenem maintains the mortgage bank loses huge sums, isoverstaffed and poorly run. According to news reports, theentity owes $1 billion to Argentina's central bank.                                                                                                          SAS PILOTS' STRIKE                                                                                                          Scandinavian Airlines System canceled two thirds of itsdomestic flights in Sweden and one third of Scandinavian andEuropean flights yesterday because of a one-day strike bySwedish pilots. The airline, whose Danish and Norwegianpilots were working normally, said it would transferpassengers to other airlines or arrange for them to travel bybus. SAS said it was prepared to pay a 7% wage increaserecommended by mediators last week but only if the pilotsaccepted a more flexible work schedule. The pilots say theyhave already made concessions on working hours and havethreatened further strikes July 20, 23 and 27 if no agreementis reached before then.

SPECIAL LUFTHANSA FLIGHTS                                                                                                          Lufthansa, West Germany's national air carrier, willoperate two special flights to East Berlin in August, thefirst time in 45 years the airline will fly to the city inwhich it was founded.

SWITCH FROM SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD                                                                                                          Britain's largest jewelry retailer said it would stopselling jewelry made with South African gold. The decisionfollowed pickets of its stores by anti-apartheid groups.   A spokesman for the company, Ratners PLC, said the movewas part of a continuing switch to North American goldsupplies. He denied the move was in reponse to anti-apartheidpressure.   Ratners said South African gold is found in 2% to 3% ofits gold jewelry.   One anti-apartheid group, End Loans to South Africa, saidit and other groups had applied pressure on Ratners inresponse to African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela'scall to intensify sanctions and boycott South African goodsto end apartheid. The End Loans group said it has suspendedits action against Ratners and is asking other groups to dothe same.
