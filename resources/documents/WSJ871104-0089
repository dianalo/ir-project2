Each side will attempt to choreograph the public appearances to its benefit, but it's what the public won't see that could be the most dramatic.    ---   Just one week before Mr. Gorbachev's trip to the U.S., Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze tells reporters in Moscow that the Soviet Union has reluctantly ended a self-imposed moratorium on the testing of anti-satellite weapons (ASATs). He says one ASAT destroyed a disused Soviet satellite in a test earlier that day. Mr. Shevardnadze hints that the Soviet Union would prefer no more ASAT tests and that a total moratorium on such tests would be raised at the summit.    At the same time, the national security adviser gives Mr. Reagan additional details not disclosed by Mr. Shevardnadze. Along with the ASAT test, the Soviets had launched four land- and submarine-based intercontinental missiles in a full-scale simulation of a first strike against the U.S.    Washington, Dec. 7, 1987:   Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev begins his three-day visit to the U.S. with a long meeting with President Reagan. Senior White House officials tell reporters that Mr. Gorbachev has offered key concessions on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF) verification and on sublimits to the number of long-range missiles now under negotiation at the broader strategic arms reduction talks (START) in Geneva. The officials say both concessions make it highly likely that an INF treaty and a START protocol will be signed by the end of Mr. Gorbachev's U.S. visit.    They also disclose that Messrs. Reagan and Gorbachev had &quot;a frank and firm exchange&quot; on America's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). While the two leaders &quot;agree to disagree,&quot; the White House officials say they have also pledged not to let these differences get in the way of an INF treaty or the START negotiations.    Washington, Dec. 8, 1987:   On the second day of his visit to the U.S., Mr. Gorbachev presides at a hastily arranged private breakfast with congressional leaders. Sources say Mr. Gorbachev had asked for the unexpected meeting to tell the congressmen that the Soviet Union will reimpose its moratorium on ASAT testing if Congress orders a similar restraint on the U.S.    The sources say Mr. Gorbachev also encouraged Congress to join him in continued observance of key restrictions under the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and in the pursuit of a comprehensive nuclear-weapons test ban.    Later in the day at an unscheduled news conference, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze make the surprise announcement that the two countries have agreed to conduct a joint space mission on the Soviets' MIR space station in the fall of 1988.    Mr. Gorbachev, appearing on a special edition of &quot;20/20&quot; with Barbara Walters, hails the proposed MIR venture and offers Soviet space-launching services for U.S. payloads until the space shuttle is back on track. He calls upon Americans to join the Soviets in a new era of &quot;openness in the skies.&quot; He declines to discuss progress being made on other issues but says his objectives include &quot;radical reductions&quot; in strategic arms and a demilitarization of outer space.    Washington, Dec. 9, 1987:   On the last day of his visit to the U.S., Mr. Gorbachev enters the White House for a final meeting with President Reagan. It is expected that the two will emerge in about two hours to formally sign an INF treaty and protocols for a new START agreement that would reduce strategic arsenals by 50% over the next seven years.    In the Oval Office, President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev sit beside a crackling fire. The Soviet leader recounts his talks with members of Congress and American citizens about their mutual hopes for improved U.S.-Soviet relations. He lists the economic problems of the Soviet Union and laments all the resources being diverted to his country's nuclear arsenals.    Noting the progress already made at the summit, Mr. Gorbachev looks straight into Mr. Reagan's eyes and says, &quot;You know, Mr. President, we must have an accommodation on the ABM treaty. We insist on banning space-based weapons and you must adhere to a strict interpretation of the ABM treaty as approved by your own Congress before we can formally sign any of the agreements reached so far in our negotiations.&quot;    Outside, everything for the official signing ceremony is ready. The president stares at the general secretary and says, &quot;I'll need a few moments in private with my advisers.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev rises, extends his hand and says, &quot;Of course.&quot;    After the Soviet leader and his interpretor leave the room, the president summons his top aides. As he sinks into his chair, he stares out into the gray drizzle of a Washington December and ponders his presidency and the future of America.    ---   Sen. Wilson, (R., Calif.), is a member of the Armed Services Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
