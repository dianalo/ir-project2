A Draft Environmental Assessmenthas been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the Stateof Mississippi, other Federal agencies, and private groups to considerthe biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of acquiring 15,000acres of waterfowl habitat in the area and establishing a national wildliferefuge. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal arewelcomed, and should be sent to the address below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Land acquisition planning for the project is currentlyunderway. The draft assessment will be available to the public as of June16, 1989. Written comments must be received no later than July 24, 1989,to be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments and requests for copies of the assessmentand further information should be addressed to: Mr. Charles Danner, Chief,Project Development Branch, Office of Refuges and Wildlife, U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, 75 Spring Street, SW., Room 1240, Atlanta, Georgia 30303.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The primary objectives of the proposalare to preserve wintering habitat for mallard, pintail, blue-winged teal,and wood duck; and preserve production habitat for wood duck to help meetthe habitat goals presented in the North American Waterfowl ManagementPlan. Establishment of a refuge and proper management would provide excellentwintering waterfowl habitat and a needed waterfowl refuge in the LowerMississippi River Valley. Secondary compatible uses would possibly includepublic outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, research, and environmentaleducation.The St. Catherine's Creek area is significant to wintering waterfowl dueto: (1) Geographic location in the Mississippi Flyway, (2) habitat diversity,and (3) seasonal flooding. The bottomland hardwood forests, the convertedwetlands, and associated habitats also provide habitat for a great diversityof other wildlife. Big game species including deer and turkey are abundant.Small game and furbearers prevalent on the area are rabbit, coyote, beaver,otter, mink, nutria, raccoon, gray fox, red fox, bobcat, and opossum. Doves,quail, raptors, and wading birds are also common on the area. Endangeredspecies likely to occur on the area are wintering bald eagles and occasionallymigrating peregrine falcons.The proposed area is located adjacent to the Mississippi River in westernAdams County, Mississippi, approximately 7 miles south of Natchez and threemiles west of U.S. Highway 61. Catahoula National Wildlife Refuge lies35 miles to the west, and Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge lies 50miles north of the proposed refuge. The two major landowners within theproposed refuge are willing sellers and support establishment of a refugein the area.Service biologists have developed a draft environmental assessment in coordinationwith the State of Mississippi, other Federal agencies and private groupsto consider the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects ofacquiring 15,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the area and establishinga national wildlife refuge. Three alternatives and their potential impactson the environment are presented and evaluated. The Service believes thepreferred alternative, Acquisition and Management by the Fish and WildlifeService, is a positive step in preventing the loss of additional acresneeded to support populations in the Lower Mississippi River Valley.<ITAG tagnum="20">June 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
