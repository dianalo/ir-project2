In the end, 12 citizens after 12 days ofdeliberation found that North _ no matter what his position, nomatter what his mission, no matter what the president called him _was guilty. They found that he obstructed a congressional inquiryinto the Iran-contra affair, shredded official U.S. documents andillegally accepted a $14,000 gratuity. This national hero is now aconvicted felon.</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Richmond (Va.) News Leader.</TEXT><TEXT>   We hear a lot about this contemporary time's lack of heroes. Onereason we lack them is that we tear down the ones we otherwisemight have _ for instance, Oliver North. Who would want to be ahero and endure what he has endured?   Here is a man who has laid down his life for others _ inVietnam, in Central America. There are many who owe, in bothplaces, their lives to his. He has been called a ``hero'' by twoPresidents. A leader of the Contras testified, ``We are going toerect a monument to Colonel North once we free Nicaragua.''   Yet he has been run down by the very government for which hetoiled. The President who could have saved him did not. The jurytried, but came up short. And now, the legalistic hounding willcontinue _ of Colonel North and others _ with all the consequentanguish and cost.</TEXT><TEXT>   From the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman:   North is no national hero. But he is certainly not totally toblame for what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. The jury seemsto have understood that. So should the public.</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Evening Sun in Baltimore:   From the time Oliver North first came to public attention in themidst of the Iran-contra affair, he has been a riveting andcontroversial figure. Many Americans followed the lead of PresidentReagan, who pronounced North a ``national hero'' despite the factthat he had just fired him. Others saw him more clearly _ as acomplicated man whose energy epitomized the can-do spirit Americansthrive on, but one whose zeal overcame his judgment.   Now, in a trial remarkable for its fairness under the glare ofpublicity and controversy, a jury has concluded that in threespecific cases North did indeed step over the line that should haveseparated vigorous pursuit of his duty from criminal acts. ...   Americans can admire commitment and zeal. They can admire manyof the qualities Oliver North has long sought to exemplify. Butzeal and commitment must be tempered by judgment. That's onefunction of law _ to establish boundaries that impose good judgmenton excessive zeal. North and his supporters are claiming a victoryin the fact that his was acquitted on nine other counts. But thoseacquittals do not erase the seriousness of the charges for which hewas found guilty. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Orange County (Calif.) Register:   ... It is simply unfair for one low-echelon aide to bear thebrunt of the charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. Perhaps theappeals courts will realize that and throw the case out. Or perhapsPresident Bush will get there first, and pardon Ollie.</TEXT><TEXT>   From the Los Angeles Daily News:   North's trial shares similaries with that of Daniel Ellsberg andAnthony Russo, who leaked the Pentagon Papers. In the 1973Ellsberg-Russo case, which ended in a mistrial, the defense arguednot that Ellsberg and Russo were not involved in the leak of thePentagon Papers, but that those papers never should have beenclassified. North's defense also was based on a disagreement withthe law; most of his actions were predicated on a belief that thepresident, not Congress, should run foreign policy...   In light of Thursday's verdict, the spending of over $12 millionby special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh to build a case against Northhas to be considered overkill. ...The good news is that while theprosecution against North was politically motivated, the jury'sverdict was fair and balanced.   If ... punishment goes so far, say, as to end the much-decoratedveteran's military pension, President Bush should pardon North, whohas paid greatly for his mistakes as it is.</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Morning News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash.:   The anti-climactic finale to the North affair was a letdownpolitically. But that's beside the point.   It so happened that the passions aroused by the Iran-Contrascandal came to focus on Oliver North's trial, and that partisansof both sides sought vindication in the verdict. But in thiscountry, trials aren't staged for political vindication: They'reheld to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused.   North received all the due process that any defendant could haveasked for.</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Boston Globe:   No man, the jurors found, stands above the law, once againreaffirming the most basic tenet in the American legal system.   The rules of law hold even if the wrongdoing conceded by Northwas performed under the direction of President Reagan, as Northcontended.   Openly enthusiastic about his covert assignment to arm andotherwise assist the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when such aid hadbeen banned by Congress, North undoubtedly believed he was actingwith the understanding and support of his superiors in the NationalSecurity Council and the White House.   Nor is there reason to doubt that those superiors shared hisconviction. Under almost any other circumstances, they would havebeen charged in some way, along with North. Instead, they left himto face trial alone, whch may have persuaded the jury to dismissother counts against him.   His defense, that he was led to believe that everything he didwas done at the direction of the president, does not excuse him.   The trial was thorough; the law has been upheld.</TEXT><TEXT>   From The Washington Post:   If the jurors had bought Mr. North's whole defense, they wouldhave sent a message that any subterfuge, any ignoring of acongressional mandate, any covert and illegal act in thefurtherance of what a small group inside the government believes tobe in the best interests of the country, is justifiable. Theydidn't do that. The verdict is a statement that such acts are wrongand punishable even if the defendant believed he was acting on theorders of his superiors. ...   These jurors were not charged with deciding what other officialswere involved in this deception and cover-up. But in their longdeliberations and mixed verdict, they have indicated that theydon't believe Mr. North was the sole, or even the principal,offender.</TEXT><TEXT>   From the Albany, N.Y., Times Union:   For many who viewed former Lt. Col Oliver North as a hero,Thursday's verdict will be hard to accept. Facing 12 counts inconnection with the Iran-contra scandal, he was acquitted of ninebut convicted of three. Was that justice for a loyal Marine whothought he was serving his country, and assumed tacit approval byhis commander in chief?   It was if the verdict is seen in the proper light. Iran-Contrawas not about one Marine's loyalty or naivete. It was about agovernment within a government, a secret operation that generatedfunds by selling arms at a profit, and used the profits to carryout foreign policy _ all of it outside the parameters ofconstitutional government. ...   ... If Col. North inspires sympathy even now, it's no doubtbecause he was used by those higher-ups _ the late CIA director,William Casey, and two former nation security advisors, RobertMacFarlane and Admiral John Poindexter. ...   ... Used or not, Col. North was responsible for obeying the law....   ... The jury understood. Now the American public must understandas well _ even those who still admire the man more than the verdict.</TEXT></DOC>
