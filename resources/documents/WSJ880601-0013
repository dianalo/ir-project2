The bill, which was supported by all three political parties, is expected to be passed soon by the Senate, making it law.    The measure would prohibit advertising of tobacco in newspapers and magazines by Jan. 1, phase out the use of signs and billboards to advertise tobacco by 1991, and restrict retail displays of tobacco products. It would also curtail the sponsorship of sports and cultural events by tobacco companies.    Almost two thirds of the tobacco advertising that Canadians see is from ads in U.S. magazines, which won't be affected by the advertising ban. Tobacco advertising on Canadian radio and television was banned years ago.    The bill &quot;prevents Canadian companies from advertising to protect their (brands) against international competitors,&quot; Bill Neville, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, said. He termed the proposed law &quot;a total censorship bill, and a very ineffective censorship because it reserves the Canadian marketplace for U.S. tobacco advertising.&quot;    Some tobacco companies already have launched new strategies to deal with the proposed law. Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc. has started running U.S. advertisments in Canadian magazines for Benson andamp; Hedges 100 brand cigarettes. The move was taken partly to familiarize Canadians with the U.S. magazine ads, which will be the only ones they see if the law takes effect next January, as expected.    Penalties for breaking the law would include fines of as much as 100,000 Canadian dollars (US$80,740) or a one-year jail sentence for the first offense.    The Institute of Canadian Advertising estimates that tobacco advertising totals about C$88 million out of the C$7 billion spent on all advertising.    Industry sources say the Canadian market isn't terribly important to U.S. companies, mainly because there is no &quot;pure&quot; American company doing business there.    They estimate RJR-Macdonald Inc. has a 14% share of the market; Rothmans, 30%; and Imperial Tobacco Ltd., a unit of Imasco Ltd., controls the rest.    In the U.S., Surgeon General C. Everett Koop recently said cigarette smoking was as addictive as heroin or cocaine, sparking concern among some publishers that restrictions on tobacco ads might be in the offing. However, the U.S. tobacco industry has been preparing for ad restrictions for some time by intensifying direct marketing efforts to customers.    Canada's tobacco companies had lobbied against the proposed measure, introduced a year ago by federal Health Minister Jake Epp. But the bill had strong public support of a ban on cigarette advertising. Its passage &quot;represents a major defeat for the tobacco lobby,&quot; said Garfield Mahood, a spokesman for a coalition of major national health organizations. The government has already restricted smoking in federal government departments and agencies and federally regulated companies.    Mr. Neville said the tobacco industry in Canada is likely to launch a constitutional challenge to the law in the courts and might consider seeking an injunction to hold up enforcement of it.    Government officials acknowledge that the advertising ban is largely a symbolic measure, which isn't expected to significantly reduce smoking. The federal Justice Department has said some measures could conflict with freedom of speech guarantees under Canada's constitution.    Just as in the U.S., consumption has been declining in Canada in recent years. According to industry statistics, the total market declined to 55 billion cigarettes in 1986 from 66 billion cigarettes in 1981.    &quot;Statistics show that consumption has been in a sharp decline in Canada for a number of years and people familiar with this issue know that advertising doesn't affect consumption,&quot; Donald Harris, director of communications for Philip Morris International Inc., a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., said. He wouldn't comment on the company's strategy for coping with the ban.    Late yesterday, the House of Commons passed another bill restricting smoking in federal workplaces and on public transport, including on airlines, trains and ships. This bill, which also requires Senate approval, would provide for stricter warnings on cigarette packages and declare tobacco a hazardous product.    ---   Alix M.
