But how do you begin yourcareer?   Back up your fine arts specialty with liberal arts and solidbusiness and scientific studies, advise fine arts educators. Thefirst interview you face will be designed to discover if you canfunction in the commercial world.   ``Indeed the artist is also an entrepreneur,'' says A. WesleyTower, dean of the College of Fine Arts at Millikin University inDecatur, Ill. `` There's no shortage of talent. What we have to dois help students develop the skills they need to be successfulartists as well as men and women.''   Millikin is typical of many universities in insisting on strongliberal arts and practical studies to augment fine arts majorprograms. Students can major in studio or fine arts, art therapy,art management and commercial and computer art. But they mustcomplete at least 35 hours of liberal arts courses for theirdegrees.   At Columbia College in Columbia, Mo., art majors must completeprograms including the same general education requirements as othermajors. ``A liberal arts background is essential for an artist,''says Ben Cameron, associate professor of art. ``Artists, too, mustbe well-read and know how to write. Otherwise you get technicallygood students who have no ideas.''   Dr. Wayne Kirby, chairman of the music department of theUniversity of North Carolina at Asheville, also backs liberal artsfor his students. ``We want students who can communicate and thinkcritically. Students must understand their place in history as faras art goes. Otherwise, you have students who just know how to pushbuttons.''   UNCA students can major in music and recording, but they musttake math, physics and computer science to get their degrees.   Theater students at Duke University in Durham, N.C., can getpractical grounding in the profession now that the universitytheater is being used for previews of Broadway-bound commercialproductions. During the previews of Franz Kafka's``Metamorphosis,'' marking ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov'sdramatic debut, Duke theater management majors sat in on phonecalls and reviewed contracts for the production. Students also wereinvolved in set design and as understudies for the play,``Moonlight and Valentino,'' written by Neil Simon's daughter Ellen.   David Ball, Duke's director of drama, says that these activitieshelp students learn about theater as it really is.   And at Millikin, music students also work in real performances,starting as soon as they arrive on campus by joining any of 36performing groups. Some of these perform nationally.   Last winter, several Millikin students were invited to performat Las Vegas. `` We were asked to turn in our resumes afterperforming at the Sahara Hotel,'' says student Philip Fabry. ``Itfelt great. This is going to lead to bigger and better things.''</TEXT></DOC>
