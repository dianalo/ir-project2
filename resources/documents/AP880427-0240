The Justice Department and law enforcement groups worked out thecompromise and it is being introduced in the Senate by James A.McClure, R-Idaho.   ``Our opinion is it's not a bad bill,'' said the NRA's James J.Baker, characterizing his support as a ``qualified endorsement.''   Baker said the NRA's main concern had been to ensure thatlegislation didn't ban currently possessed firearms or any firearmscurrently being manufactured in the United States or imported here.The NRA also wanted to ensure that government officials have nodiscretion to set standards that would lead to any ban. Thecompromise would achieve those goals, said Baker.   The NRA's concerns with the compromise stem from the fact thatthere are law enforcement provisions attached to the new McClurebill unrelated to plastic guns which the NRA feels should be takenout and handled in separate legislation.   The new McClure legislation would require that guns containmaterial that would be as detectable by metal detectors as 3.7ounces of stainless steel. The gun could have less metal or adifferent kind of metal as long as it would meet the samedetectability standard.   Earlier, the NRA had insisted that there should be nogovernment-established metal standard.   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had offered legislation witha higher metallic standard than the compromise. The NRA saidMetzenbaum's bill would have banned millions of handguns.   Metzenbaum called the compromise ``very workable,'' said it will``keep undetectable weapons out of hands of terrorists.'' He addedthat the compromise ``won't in any way infringe on legitimaterights of gun owners.''   McClure said the compromise assures the safety of travelerswithout being a piece of gun control legislation.   The NRA and Meese had supported McClure's earlier bill thatwould ban manufacture of undetectable plastic guns, but not requirea specific amount of metal.   At a news conference, a Justice Department official said Meeseis not withdrawing his support from the earlier McClure bill. ``Butwe think this is a better bill,'' said Joseph Morris, director ofthe office of liaison services. Justice Department spokesmanPatrick Korten denied that Meese had changed his position on theissue.   Police organizations and gun-control advocates have insistedthat a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensuredetection by the magnetometers used in airport and buildingsecurity systems.   The gun control and police groups have argued that not having ametal standard would cause long delays in airports. They contendedthat without a minimum metal requirement for the gun, magnetometersmust be used at settings so sensitive that they would constantlytrigger alarms.</TEXT></DOC>
