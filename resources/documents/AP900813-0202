In the two previous weeks, the count had dropped by a combined56 rigs. A year ago this week, the count was 858.   Ike Kerridge, a vice president at Baker Hughes who keeps trackof the count, said the increase ``may well be'' the start of aresurgence sparked by the Iraqi oil embargo.   ``If this isn't the increase, I would certainly expect itshortly,'' Kerridge said.   But he noted most of the fluctuation came from Texas, which lastweek dropped 16 rigs and this week gained 14. Kerridge said many ofthose rigs may have been moving to other locations in South Texas,the predominant site of a surge in horizontal drilling in the pastyear.   Kerridge said he expected the count to continue increasingthroughout the remainder of the year from seasonal fluctuationsalone.   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of therig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since1940.   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.   Among major oil-producing states, Texas gained 14 rigs for theweek, after losing 16 last week. Other states with gains for theweek included California, which added six, and Louisiana andPennsylvania, which each added three.   States reporting rig declines for the week include North Dakota,down three; Ohio and Michigan, each of which dropped by two; andWyoming, which lost one rig.   Other states including Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oklahomareported their rig counts were unchanged for the week.</TEXT></DOC>
