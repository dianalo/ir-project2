Much to the surprise of many analysts, the economy still remains buoyant in an expansion that began nearly six years ago. Numerous forecasters now expect this quarter's growth to be even stronger than the second quarter, prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.    &quot;We're seeing more evidence that inflation is moving up slowly but surely,&quot; said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. Thus, interest rates &quot;also are going higher.&quot; He expects 30-year Treasury bonds yields, now about 9.4%, to surge to about 10% by year end.    Rates already have risen so sharply that some money managers find long-term bonds beginning to look attractive once again. They argue that investors are overly worried about inflation -- and that Treasury bond yields of 9 1/2% or higher historically have been tough to beat. Moreover, some analysts say rates may decline in the near term.    &quot;Within the next week or so, there is a potential for bond prices to improve,&quot; said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Inc. He expects a rebound in the dollar as well as increased bond buying by overseas investors lured by high U.S. rates. He also expects the government's index of leading economic indicators, to be reported tomorrow, to show a 0.7% decline for July, helping temporarily to ease inflation fears.    &quot;But over the longer term, the trend in rates is up,&quot; Mr. Braverman contended.    Mr. Braverman predicted that the Fed will tighten credit again late this year, prompting banks to raise their prime, or base, lending rates to 10 1/2% from 10%. &quot;Rates probably won't top out until a recession materializes within the next 12 to 18 months,&quot; he said. By that time, he said, long-term Treasury bonds will yield about 10 1/2% to 11%.    The most important clues to the economy's health this week will come Friday morning, when the Labor Department releases its August report on the nation's employment picture. Federal Reserve officials focus especially closely on the monthly labor figures in setting credit policy. &quot;The employment report is by far the most important&quot; for the bond markets each month, said Norman Robertson, senior vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.    &quot;The economy has a lot of momentum right now,&quot; Mr. Robertson said. &quot;The combination of strong economic activity and the need to ward off inflation pressures all suggest the Fed is likely to move toward further restraint&quot; later this year. He expects some short-term interest rates to rise about one percentage point by early next year, with long-term bond yields increasing about half a percentage point.    Mr. Robertson expects Friday's employment report to show an increase of about 275,000 in the number of workers on business payrolls during August. That would be about the same as July's gain of 283,000.    Fed officials might tighten credit even more quickly if the employment report shows a gain of more than 300,000, several analysts warned.    According to the median estimate of 47 analysts surveyed Friday by MMS International of Redwood City, Calif., business payrolls rose 230,000 in August. The report also is expected to show the civilian unemployment rate was 5.4%, the same as in July. Estimates on the payroll figures ranged from 170,000 to 312,000, with half falling between 210,000 and 250,000.    &quot;There is an awful lot of evidence building that third-quarter economic growth will be at least as strong as the second -- and probably stronger,&quot; said Mr. Fine of Chase Manhattan. He estimated that the economy will expand at a vigorous 4% clip, or slightly higher, this quarter. That would be up from a second-quarter pace of 3.3%, after adjusting for inflation.    The government's producer price index report, to be released Sept. 9, probably will show a large increase of 0.5% or 0.6%, Mr. Fine predicted. That would compare with 0.5% in July and 0.4% in June.    Recent evidence of economic strength &quot;paves the way for another Fed tightening over the next few weeks,&quot; according to F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Mr. McCarthy said a rise in banks' prime rates probably isn't imminent. But he believes the odds favor an increase down the road. The question is when, he said, adding that one deciding factor that could move the Fed's hand and, in turn, the banking industry, is the employment report this Friday. If that report shows vigorous growth, he said, &quot;The next firming (in Fed policy) is right around the corner.&quot;    Federal Reserve officials &quot;will have to put the brakes on a little bit more because of the strong economy and the fear of inflation,&quot; said John E. Haupert, treasurer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &quot;I think rates will stay at least as high as they are now or drift slightly upward between now and year end.&quot;    The Port Authority recently sold a new $100 million issue of consolidated bonds. &quot;I thought it was as good a time as we'll see until the end of the year&quot; to tap the bond market for funds, Mr. Haupert said.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Most interest rates drifted slightly lower in very quiet activity.    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds were quoted late in the day at 9.43%, down from 9.46% Thursday. The price of the issue rose 9/32 of a point to 96 31/32.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 1.74 points to 1198.01. It ranged between 1194.90 and 1199.72.    The government's latest 10-year notes rose to 99 5/32 from 99, while the yield slipped to 9.38% from 9.41%.    One reason some investors are reluctant to buy 10-year or 30-year bonds is that they can get nearly the same yields on shorter-term notes. For example, the Treasury's new five-year, two-month notes, auctioned Wednesday at an average yield of 9.04%, were quoted late Friday at 9.09%. The Treasury's new two-year notes, auctioned last Tuesday at an average yield of 8.72%, were quoted late Friday at 8.79%.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose to 7.34% bid from 7.28%. The rate on six-month bills fell slightly to 7.47% bid from 7.48%.    Ginnie Maes and other mortgage-backed securities ended little changed. The Ginnie Mae 10% issue for September delivery rose 1/32 to 98 11/32, with a bond equivalent yield to a 12-year average life assumption of about 10.406%.    Municipal bonds finished unchanged to slightly higher, helped by the Treasury bond market's small rally and the prospect of a continued light volume of new issues. Corporate bonds also were little changed to up 1/8 point in light trading. </TEXT></DOC>
