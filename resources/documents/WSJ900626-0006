The measure, which takes effect July 1, eliminates the 5%control the country's oil producers were forced to observe inthe first half of the year, Ms. Ingebretsen said.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Ingebretsen said the cabinet decided to scrap thelimit for the remainder of the year because it &quot;was havingvery little effect&quot; on reducing the amount of oil currentlyoverhanging the world market.   Norway enacted the controls -- which slowed crude oilproduction growth but not actual output -- in February 1987,in support of efforts by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to stabilize the crude-oil market.   From the onset of the voluntary controls, Norway said thecountry's oil producers could produce no more than 92.5% oftheir capacity. The limit was later pushed up to 95% ofcapacity for the first half of 1990.   But the measures didn't include a limit on the amount ofnew production to come on stream; thus the country's outputincreased as capacity grew with the development of new oilfields.   In a telephone interview from Oslo, Ms. Ingebretsen saidthe cabinet would review the control system before the firsthalf of 1991 and would make changes if necessary.   &quot;We enacted the measures when OPEC production was low, butsince then OPEC has increased output by 50% while productionfrom outside the organization has stabilized,&quot; she said. &quot;Nowthat it seems that OPEC has trouble staying within its quota,our measures are having very little effect on the market.&quot;   In May, Norway produced 1.67 million barrels of crude oila day.</TEXT></DOC>
