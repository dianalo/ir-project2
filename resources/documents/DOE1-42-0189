Heat cycle given is the repeated continuous heating and coolingby flowing 40 sec of hot gas and 90 sec of ordinary temperature. Materialstested are a thin plate of 24 ST3 Al-alloy which was used for an externalplate of main wing of the commercial airplane, and cast iron materialwith low elongation. The results are summarized as following: (1) 24ST3Al-alloy: Up to 200{sup 0}C, the heat cycle only reduces the tensilestrength by only 20% of at room temperature. If above 200{sup 0}C, decreasesvery much down to the value at 10,000 hours heating, as the cycle increasesand heating temperature elevates. (2) Cast steel: Without the tensileload, increase of static tensile strength is observed probably becauseof a hardening effect. Cracks generate and extend for a certain sectionalshape even in a heat cycle without any application of load. (18 figs,1 tab, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
