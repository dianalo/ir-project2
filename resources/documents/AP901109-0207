Voters in New York state Tuesday rejected a $1.9 billion bondpackage that would have spent most of its money to buy and setaside Adirondack woodland and establish solid-waste programs. InCalifornia the ``Big Green'' environmental proposal, which wouldhave raised money for forest protection, such as $300 million tobuy stands of ancient redwoods, was defeated.   ``People first and foremost are concerned with economicevents,'' said Neal Atterman, municipal research director atKidder, Peabody andamp; Co. ``Look at consumer confidence, then put thatinto a voting booth connotation. People don't want radical changesright now.''   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a primary sponsorof the environmental measure there, also said voters were showing amove toward fiscal conservatism.   ``I think the invasion of Kuwait, the beginning of therecession, the national budget crisis, the state budget crisis -all those things have scared people,'' he said.   Environmental issues weren't the only bond questions turnedaway. Voters rejected 43.5 percent of the proposed bond issues,amounting to 59.5 percent of the total dollar value of bonds onTuesday's ballot, according to The Bond Buyer, the municipal bondmarket daily newspaper.   Voters approved 242 state and local government bond issuestotaling $4.887 billion out of 428 issues totaling 12.067 billion,The Bond Buyer reported. The percentage of approvals was the lowestin a general election since 10 percent were approved in 1975, thenewspaper said.   In last year's general election, 85.7 percent of the $6.68billion of bond issues on ballots were approved.   ``A lot of it is probably related to the economy. It may also berelated to the federal tax increase. People think we can't affordto borrow,'' said Claire Cohen, head of government finance at FitchInvestors Service Inc., a bond rating agency.   Other analysts, like George Friedlander, head of municipalresearch at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said the heavyrejection of bond issues this year was a sign voters didn't trustpolitical leaders to spend the money wisely.   Bonds that would have funded affordable housing and publicfacilities were turned away, but voters were more receptive toissues for education, health care and transportation.   In Massachusetts, voters rejected a plan that would have cut taxrevenues by $1.35 billion this fiscal year.   ``I think that what's going on is very positive,'' Attermansaid. ``Voters are concerned about the future and want to keeppublic debt lower rather than higher.''   Analysts said voters showed they were selective about the issuesthey approved, with California voters giving the go-ahead to $800million school construction issue and defeating more thanthree-fourths of the $5.279 billion worth of proposed bonds.   The heavy drubbing bonds took should not have a major impact onthe already short-supply municipal bond market, Friedlander said.   The vast majority of municipal bonds are not decided atelections, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Nov. 12</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
