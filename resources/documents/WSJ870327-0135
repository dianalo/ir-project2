Foote, a producer of lithium chemicals, manganese products and iron alloys, is 83%-owned by Newmont Mining Corp., New York. Rio Tinto is a United Kingdom-based metals concern.    T.A. Williams, Foote's president and chief executive officer, said the only assets the Borax affiliate would acquire are lithium and ferrosilicon operations. As previously reported, negotiations to sell all of Foote's other operations are under way.    Terms of the Borax transaction, including price, weren't disclosed. Mr. Williams said all the terms are &quot;subject to a continuing due-diligence investigation.&quot; He said recent sales data for the lithium and ferrosilicon operations weren't immediately available.    In the past two years, Foote has sustained total net losses of more than $40 million, reflecting depressed market conditions and several plant closings. </TEXT></DOC>
