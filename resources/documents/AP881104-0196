He said 4,000 paramilitary troops were deployed in the Batalaarea in case of a Hindu backlash of violence.   ``We have imposed curfew in the area. The situation is very, verytense,'' Sharma said. He said 22 Hindus, three Sikhs and a Christianwere killed in the blasts.   The police spokesman said the state's borders with Haryana andJammu-Kashmir were sealed after the blasts and a state-wide alerthad been announced. No arrests were reported.   Batala, 32 miles north of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, has apopulation of about 150,000. Hindus outnumber Sikhs in the town andcontrol the trade.
