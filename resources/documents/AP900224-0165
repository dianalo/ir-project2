The settlement, which could cost the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency up to $50 million, came in a civil lawsuit filedJan. 19 in U.S. District Court to obtain assistance for low-incomepeople who were displaced by the Oct. 17 quake.   It is the first time FEMA has provided money to renovateresidential hotels damaged in a disaster, said Lorrie Jean, deputydirector and general counsel for FEMA.   ``We've done this because we're basically learning how torespond to the unique needs of presidentially declared emergenciesin urban areas,'' Ms. Jean told reporters.   The lawsuit was filed by at least four public interest agencies,including the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County. The agenciessaid at least 5,000 people were left homeless because their hotelrooms were damaged by the quake.   Stephen E. Ronfeldt of the Legal Aid Society said the agenciesagreed to settle the lawsuit because they were happy with how muchFEMA was willing to bend its policies to help poor people affectedby the quake.   The settlement was tentatively approved by U.S. District JudgeEugene Lynch, who set a March 16 hearing for final approval.   It requires FEMA funds to cover about 1,800 hotel units andother inexpensive housing affected, and calls for FEMA to providemoney for short-term housing assistance while replacement units arefound.   Under the settlement, housing units can be replaced byrehabilitation or through rent vouchers to owners of renovatedapartment buildings. Construction of new units is not allowed.   Tens of thousands of other people also could be affected by thesettlement because it calls for FEMA reimbursement checks to go toindividuals who were sharing housing with non-relatives. The agencyhad previously decided to issue one check per shared housing unitthat was damaged in the quake.</TEXT></DOC>
