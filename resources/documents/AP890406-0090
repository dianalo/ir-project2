The fasting in Islam's holiest month is one of the majorsacraments of the faith for the world's 1 billion Moslems. Themonth marks the time when the Angel Gabriel inspired the ProphetMohammed to write the Koran, or Moslem holy book, according toIslam.   Saudi Arabian King Fahd, custodian of Islam's holiest shrines atMecca and Medina, and Crown Prince Abdullah concentrated on thebloodshed in Lebanon in their annual Ramadan message.   They appealed to the warring Lebanese Christians and Syrian andDruse Moslem militiamen ``to achieve the peace that all heavenlyreligions have prescribed to spare human bloodshed and to preservethe dignity of man.''   Travelers, soldiers at war and pregnant women are exempt fromthe fast, which traditionally starts when the crescent moon markinga new month in the Islamic lunar calendar is sighted by the nakedeye.   Saudi Arabia announced late Wednesday that sightings had beenreported to a special religious council, and therefore the holymonth would start Thursday.   Moslems also started fasting in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, theUnited Arab Emirates, Israel, Libya, Tunisia and Sudan.   In Egypt, where the oldest Islamic theology university ofAl-Azhar is located, the responsible religious council calculatedthe preceding Moslem month would end Thursday, starting Ramadan onFriday. Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, North and South Yemen, Moroccoand Algeria have made similar announcements.   The Sultanate of Oman has to wait for its council to look forthe crescent.   Iran, dominated by the Shiite minority sect of Islam, usuallystarts Ramadan a day after all others. The predominant sect ofIslam is Sunni.   In Lebanon, Ramadan falls along sectarian lines. The 800,000Sunnis, following Saudi Arabia, started fasting Thursday. TheShiites, Lebanon's largest sect with 1 million members, will followIran and start Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
