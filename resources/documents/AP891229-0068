In a letter to WAGA-TV, an organization calling itself Americansfor a Competent Federal Judicial System also threatened to killlawyers, judges and members of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People ``any time a black man rapes a whitewoman.''   The threatened reprisals led black leaders to bolster securityplans for the Jan. 15 celebration of slain civil rights leaderMartin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.   Precautions were being taken at the 600 southeastern branches ofthe NAACP, said Earl Shinhoster, the organization's regionaldirector. He declined to say what those precautions were.   An FBI official said he believed the letter was authenticbecause it contained information available only to someone closelyassociated with the construction and mailing of the bombs thatkilled 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance athis home near Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 16 and Savannah attorneyRobert Robinson two days later.   William L. Hinshaw, agent in charge of the FBI investigation,would not specify what that information is.   ``It opens a new door, and we hope through that door will passinformation from the public,'' he said.   Authorities are unfamiliar with the group, Hinshaw said.   The Atlanta Constitution, in today's editions, quotedunidentified sources as saying the letter contained the sameidentifying code as the previous letters and that physical evidencelinks all of the letters to the bombs. The newspaper did notelaborate.   In its evening broadcasts Thursday, WAGA-TV released excerpts ofthe letter, which said the group held a secret meeting Dec. 19 inMontgomery, Ala., after the two fatal bombings.   According to the station, the letter said group members fromGeorgia, Florida and Alabama gathered ``to draft new orders'' andto go public with their mission.   The group claimed it ``assassinated Judge Robert S. Vance andattorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocities committed onJulie Love,'' a white woman who was robbed, raped and murdered inAtlanta in 1988.   The letter also said: ``Two more prominent members of the NAACPshall be assassinated, using more sophisticated means, as part ofthe same reprisal.''   The letter expressed anger over school desegregation cases,apparently referring to a long-running battle over the DeKalbCounty, Ga., schools in which the slain judge was involved.   ``Protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority thangranting the blacks' demand for white teachers for theirchildren,'' the letter said.   Vance was on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court panel that directedDeKalb schools to transfer about 120 veteran teachers frompredominantly white schools to predominantly black ones in aneffort to balance teacher experience in the system.   Robinson handled a desegregation case in Savannah, and anotherschool desegregation case came out of Jacksonville, Fla., where abomb was delivered to NAACP headquarters. That bomb and one sent tothe 11th Circuit building in Atlanta were safely removed.   ``Anytime a black man rapes a white woman in Alabama, Florida orGeorgia in the future, Americans for a Competent Federal JudicialSystem shall assassinate one federal judge, one attorney and oneofficer of the NAACP,'' the letter said.   It cited the slaying of Ms. Love, 27, who disappeared July 11,1988, after her car ran out of gas. Her remains were found a littlemore than a year later, in a wooded lot near an inner-cityneighborhood.   Two young black men _ Emmanuel Fitzgerald Hammond, 24, andWilliam Maurice Porter, 20 _ have been charged in the slaying.Porter pleaded guilty in November and is expected to testifyagainst Hammond.   ``It's very difficult to react,'' the NAACP's Shinhoster said.``The threats against the NAACP and others contained in thatcommunication must be taken seriously. We've already had twodecent, fine individuals murdered by that group.''   Walter Morrison, a spokesman at the NAACP's Baltimoreheadquarters, said the group wasn't intimidated by the action.   ``We've indicated that we will not be deterred,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
