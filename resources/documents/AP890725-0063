John Conyers entered the race formayor, giving incumbent Coleman Young his stiffest challenge sincehe first won the job almost 16 years ago.   Conyers, 60, filed petitions for candidacy Monday with CityClerk James Bradley. Amelie Allen, a worker in the clerk's office,said Conyers had more than enough petitions to make him eligible.   ``I'm asking myself if I'm doing the right thing,'' Conyerssaid. ``One is never sure about these great decisions.''   But after filing the petitions, he said, ``There's no turningback.''   Speculation that the powerful, 13-term Democratic congressmanwould run increased after Conyers lambasted Young two weeks ago,saying the mayor ``has an unbroken record of personal and politicalmistakes in the last few years.''   ``It's time for him to go,'' Conyers said of Young, who isseeking his fifth 4-year term.   Nominating petitions bearing 55,000 signatures also were filedMonday on behalf of Young, spokesman Robert Berg said. Young had nocomment on Conyers' candidacy, Berg said.   Young's critics have accused him of focusing on downtowndevelopment in the nation's sixth-largest city at the expense ofneighborhoods. His years in office have seen a continuation of thewhite and middle-class flight from the city to the suburbs.   Observers say Conyers will force Young, who had planned onignoring other candidates and campaigning against the news media,to go on the offensive.   ``Coleman Young is an excellent campaigner, an excellent votegetter, but he's never had an established black candidate runningagainst him _ and now he's got two,'' said political consultantJack Casey. He referred to City Council President Erma Henderson,who is also running.   ``What's going to be fascinating now is whether the black votewill split,'' Casey said. ``If it does, white voters are going tohave a lot to say'' about who is elected.   About 70 percent of Detroit's population of slightly more than 1million is black.   Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. He isactive in several rights organizations and is known battling SouthAfrica's apartheid policy.   Two other candidates, accountant Thomas Barrow, whom Youngdefeated in 1985; and businessman Charles Costa also filedpetitions Monday. Candidates have until today to be eligible to runin the non-partisan Sept. 12 primary.</TEXT></DOC>
