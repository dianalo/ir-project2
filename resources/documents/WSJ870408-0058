Alberta Energy, an oil and gas producer, said the contract involves long-term sales of natural gas to cogeneration plants that are manufactured, owned and operated by Solar. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam or heat from a common fuel source, such as natural gas.    Alberta Energy said the contract initially involves the delivery of five million cubic feet daily of natural gas for 15 years to a 16,000-kilowatt power plant in Kern County, Calif. The price of the gas wasn't disclosed. The heat will be used for certain oil recovery operations and the electricity will be sold to Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., San Francisco.    A spokesman for Alberta Energy said additional gas sales will depend on the market growth for Solar's cogeneration plants. The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and transportation arrangements from Alberta Energy's natural gas fields in Alberta. </TEXT></DOC>
