Two shipments of Dutch, Belgian and Israeli explosives valued at about $1 million were delivered to Tehran in July and August 1985 by St. Lucia Airways, a so-called proprietary airline that was then owned by the CIA, according to U.S. intelligence sources.    The shipments were arranged by Swedish trader Karl-Erik Schmitz, a major supplier of munitions to Iran in its bitter seven-year war with Iraq. Swedish authorities have charged Mr. Schmitz with making illegal arms sales. The shipments were described in records gathered by police in Sweden and Belgium. House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair know of the incident.    As a CIA entity trying to look like a private company, the airline's managers had some responsibility to take on commercial business. This was an embarrassing case when the company put profit before adherence to U.S. policy of trying to embargo European arm sales to Iran. &quot;It was not a trial run,&quot; said a U.S. intelligence source. &quot;It was really a case where the people running the company forgot who their stockholders were.&quot;    In November 1985, the CIA arranged for St. Lucia to transport an estimated 18 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles sold by Israeli middlemen to Iran. The request was made by the White House National Security Council staff in pursuit of efforts to win freedom for U.S. hostages. In January 1986, a finding signed by President Reagan authorized the CIA's role in this sale after the fact.    St. Lucia probably is no longer a CIA airline; its cover has been blown by the Iran-Contra investigation. &quot;As a proprietary, they're through,&quot; one source said. </TEXT></DOC>
