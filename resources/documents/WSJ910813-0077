A U.S. District Court jury in Philadelphia ruled on Aug. 1that nurses placed in temporary hospital jobs by CriticalCare Registered Nursing Inc., Holmes, Pa., are independentcontractors. This means Critical Care isn't required towithhold taxes from the nurses' paychecks and payunemployment and Social Security taxes on their earnings.</LP><TEXT>   The IRS claimed the nurses are actually employees of thenursing-employment agency. The government is trying tocollect about $60,000 in back taxes and interest resultingfrom a 1984 audit.   Jeffrey Cooper, a Philadelphia lawyer who representsCritical Care, says he believes it's the first time theindependent contractor-employee issue has been litigated in ajury trial. Typically, these cases are decided during IRSaudits or on appeal by the U.S. Tax Court, where juriesaren't used. A Justice Department attorney says thegovernment plans to ask the U.S. District Court to set asidethe Critical Care verdict.   For now, the jury's decision is a minor setback for theIRS, which has been stepping up its enforcement campaignagainst companies that avoid taxes by classifying legitimateemployees as outside contractors. But the case is sure to addfuel to the controversy by bolstering the claims of manysmall businesses that they are being unfairly targeted bygovernment revenue agents.   The IRS is expected to issue a revenue ruling within thenext couple of weeks &quot;that could make the issue of whether aperson is an employee or an independent contractor clearer,&quot;says an IRS spokesperson.   Business owners hope so. They complain that the IRS'sground rules governing employment status are deliberatelyvague. They say that penalties for even unsuspectingmisclassification can wipe out a small company. Also, theysay the definition of who is and who isn't an employee canvary from industry to industry and from city to city.   To be sure, Congress is partially responsible for theIRS's fuzzy employment rulings, since it has continuallyrefused to either write into law, or to let the IRS issue,detailed regulations to employers containing definitions ofwhat constitutes an employee and an independent contractor.   &quot;They {the IRS} see this as a revenue-rich area, andthey've accelerated their audits,&quot; says Benson Goldstein,manager of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's tax division. Inthe fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1989, the IRS reclassified76,000 workers from independent contractor to employee, mostof them small company workers, and handed down $93.8 millionin proposed assessments.   While small companies of every stripe have run afoul ofthe IRS on this issue, the stakes are especially high fortrucking and construction companies, courier and deliveryservices and travel agencies. Nurses who work part-time andconsultants have also been targeted by the IRS.   Federal and state payroll taxes, plus health insurance andpension contributions that most employers make for theiremployees, can add roughly one-third to a company's payrollcosts. Many small companies say that escaping these costs andgaining the staffing flexibility offered by independentcontractors are vital for their survival.   Donald Roberts, an IRS spokesman, concedes that the topic&quot;is probably getting more attention that it used to get,&quot;from the tax enforcers. But he adds, &quot;I don't think we'retrying to force them {companies} to treat as employees peoplewho aren't truly employees.&quot;   Many small businesses might contest that statement. SallySumner, Critical Care's president, says the government didn'targue during the four-day trial that the nurses representedby the employment agency hadn't paid their own income taxes.&quot;The only reason the IRS is spending millions of taxpayerdollars on this issue is that they want us to be their taxcollectors,&quot; Ms. Sumner says. Workers classified asindependent contractors are responsible for estimating andpaying taxes themselves.   In Mansfield, Ohio, the IRS has been questioning theemployment status of a former worker of American EnergySavers Co., a home-remodeling company. Michael Horning, thecompany's president, says all of his half-dozen workers, whosell and install roofing, windows and siding, are independentcontractors.   &quot;They set their own schedules. We don't train them. Weorder the materials, and they install it,&quot; he says. Suchfactors are among 20 &quot;common law&quot; questions the IRS uses todetermine employee status. To avoid putting one company at acompetitive disadvantage, the tax service also makesallowances for the worker classification practices of othercompanies in an industry.   Mr. Horning says he's in a &quot;no man's land&quot; until the IRSrules on the case. He worries that an adverse ruling by theIRS on the former worker will expose the company to back taxpayments, penalties and interest on all its workers. &quot;We'retalking tens of thousands of dollars,&quot; says Mr. Horning.   At Bud's Airport andamp; Taxi Service in Hopkinton, Mass., ownerGeorge Dusseault says an IRS examiner offered to waive$25,000 in penalties if he shifted his 20 drivers fromindependent contractor to employees. &quot;I almost did it until Iput a pencil to it and realized I'd have to increase my faresby 100%,&quot; to make up for withholding and salary taxes, hesays.   Mr. Dusseault surveyed other livery companies in theBoston area, confirmed that the prevailing practice was tohire drivers on a contract basis, and sent the results to theIRS. Later, he received a letter from the IRS canceling hisdeficiency. &quot;I have it framed in my office,&quot; he says, adding,&quot;They could have put me out of business.&quot;   Savings to employers don't impress union officials, whopoint out that outside contractors can't draw unemploymentinsurance if they lose their jobs, since their employershaven't paid into unemployment trust funds on their behalf.   In Congress, proposals to change the law have bogged downin debate between union and business backers. One idea thatcould come to a vote: An amnesty period that would allowcompanies to reclassify their workers without threat of IRSpenalties.   Cleveland-based Lincoln Moving andamp; Storage Co. has beenfighting the IRS over classification of its drivers fornearly four years. Lawrence Rousch, Lincoln's president, saysan IRS audit in 1975 gave a green light to the company'spractice of using independent contractors to drivecompany-owned trucks on interstate moves.   Under a &quot;safe harbor&quot; section of the 1978 Tax Act, the IRSisn't supposed to reclassify workers if their status has beenapproved in an earlier audit. Mr. Rousch says IRS examinershave told him the safe harbor provision doesn't apply andthat he owes roughly $100,000 in two years of back taxes,interest and penalties. &quot;They're really playing hardball,&quot;Mr. Rousch says.   One result of the tax probe: Lincoln Moving is now usingonly owner-operated trucks on long-distance moves. Sixcontract drivers who worked for the company in the pastaren't getting any Lincoln long hauls.</TEXT></DOC>
