Sheik Salem Sabah said the two men _ Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas,25, an Iraqi national; and 30-year-old Nasser Matar Dahash, whosefamily lives in Kuwait without official citizenship _ were released``a while ago, having completed their prison terms.''   The pro-Iranian terrorists were convicted of a spate of bombingsin Kuwait in December 1983, including the Dec. 12 attack on the U.S.Embassy that involved driving a bomb-laden truck into the compound.Other targets hit in the attacks were the French embassy and Kuwaitairport control tower, an industrial center, the Electricity andWater Ministry's control center, and offices and residences ofAmericans.   The Arab government reported five people killed, including thetruck driver, and 86 wounded. The U.S. Embassy listed seven killed,including the truck driver.   Speaking to reporters today, Sheik Salem said the release ``hasnothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations.''   The 17 terrorists sent to Kuwaiti jails included three sentencedto death by hanging, seven to life imprisonment, four to 15 years injail, one to 10 years and the two to five years.   Three others, Iraqi Shiites, were tried and sentenced to death intheir absence.   They all were sentenced March 27, 1984, by Kuwait's statesecurity court.   The terrorists include Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Lebanese, mostbelonging to the Shiite branch of Islam, which is the dominant sectin Iran.   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemfaction based in Lebanon, had demanded the release of the 17convicts in return for two American hostages it has been holdingsince 1985.   Those captives are Terry Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, the chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press; and ThomasSutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean of agricultureat the American University of Beirut. Islamic Jihad also claims tobe holding hospital administrator David Jacobsen, 55, of HuntingtonBeach, Calif.   Anderson, kidnapped on March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of 15Westerners missing in Lebanon. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.   Captors of the other hostages _ including seven other Americans _have not publicly demanded the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
