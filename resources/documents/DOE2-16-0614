The principles of the population doseevaluation and permissible release limits determination are formed. Meteorologicalfactors are identified that have major effects on calculation of theaverage annual atmospheric dilution coefficient. A programme is suggestedfor additional meteorological and aerological observations to ensurethe evaluation of specific micrometeorological features of the site incase of its location in a region with complicated relief of the terrainor frequent abnormal meteorological conditions. 4 refs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
