The president, in a one-hour meeting with House Republicans onCapitol Hill and later with a group of state and county GOPofficials, called on GOP members to unite behind a new effort topush some kind of help for the rebels through Congress.   U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29.   ``We are determined to get continued assistance to theresistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,''the president told the closed meeting of lawmakers on Capitol Hill,according to a text of his remarks provided by the White House.   Alluding, however, to Democratic efforts to thwart any militaryaid for the rebels, Reagan added, ``Those who led the fight againstour package of assistance to the democratic resistance cannotescape responsibility'' if the rebel forces wither.   Reagan, in response to a reporter's question, declined to sayprecisely what kind of aid package he was supporting.   In a separate session with the local GOP officials, Reagan againpointed the finger of blame at House Democrats.   ``The House leadership, who played hardball to win the vote tocut off aid, now says it won't accept responsibility for thedestruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fightersare extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in Nicaragua,the American people will be the ones to decide who isresponsible,'' Reagan said.   The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contrasupporters in the Senate who are proposing a one-year, $48 million``humanitarian'' aid package that also would give the CIA the rightto deliver previously stockpiled weapons, and the president theright to get a quick vote in Congress on sending new military aidunder certain conditions.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters afterReagan's Capitol Hill visit that the administration has not yetaligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have apackage introduced soon and a vote prior to Congress' departurenext week for an Easter recess.   ``We'd like to have a vote before then,'' Fitzwater said.   On Capitol Hill, House GOP Leader Robert Michel said theadministration ``will surely be supporting, or at leastencouraging, the kind of movement we are seeing in the Senate.''   Michel, R-Ill., said last week's incursion across the Honduranborder by Sandinista troops was creating political pressure on someof the moderate Democrats whose votes have been crucial to theoutcome of the closely divided issue in the past. ``That doesn't doanything but help our side,'' Michel said.   Adding to that pressure, said Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., is theinstability in other areas of Central America, including Panama andEl Salvador. ``The whole region is still in an unstablecondition,'' he said. Some moderate Democrats last week ``werequite pale in their appearance when they realized there was thisincursion'' into Honduras.   ``We think there is some potential there to get a few more votesthan we have had in the past,'' said Lott, the chief House GOP votecounter.   Before the meeting, Reagan told reporters he hopes thecease-fire talks between the Sandinista government and the rebelswill be successful, but said he would not withhold pressure for newContra aid to await the outcome of the talks.   ``I hope they can achieve something there'' in the talks, hesaid. Asked if he would hold up a new request for rebel aid whilethe talks are in progress, Reagan replied, ``We haven't given thatany consideration.''   Before Reagan arrived, Michel said an aid package should bedeveloped during the cease-fire talks.   ``We want to be prepared in the event negotiations break down,so there's always a fallback position,'' Michel said. ``We ought tobe very wary... take a more worst-case scenario.''   House Democrats said any action on further aid should await theoutcome of those negotiations.   ``What we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks,''House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said on Monday. ``I hope bothsides will be very forthcoming.''   The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels on Mondayopened three days of talks at the border town of Sapoa byexchanging cease-fire proposals and agreeing to a truce during thenegotiations.   Asked about prospects for a $48 million Contra aid proposalbeing drawn up by Senate backers of the rebels, Wright objected toprovisions that allow the CIA to continue delivering previouslystockpiled weapons and that would guarantee a future vote inCongress on new military aid.   ``If they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid,that could be done very swiftly,'' Wright said. ``We would be readyto meet (with Republicans) at any time.''   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in a toughly wordedSenate floor speech, said the administration's policies haveproduced few positive results.   ``The United States, after all of this _ not to mention severalhundred million dollars _ has achieved virtually nothing positivein Central America,'' Byrd said. ``We have no right to askAmericans to risk their sons and daughters when there are othersolutions we have not even tried.''</TEXT></DOC>
