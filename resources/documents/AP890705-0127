An NEA technology report says teachers could devote more time toteaching and less to paperwork if they were able to use computers torecord grades, keep attendance, schedule activities, develop tests,generate worksheets and write letters to parents.   The recommendations were part of a technology report issued onthe final day of the teacher union's annual conference. A rally toshow solidarity with Chinese pro-democracy demonstrators and aspeech by incoming president Keith Geiger also were featured.   Geiger, who takes office at the end of the summer, reiterated hisintention to put collective bargaining high on the NEA agenda. Hesaid the NEA will use its clout and political expertise to supportany state affiliate that develops a realistic, long-term plan to winsuch rights in the 14 states that don't have them.   Geiger said collective bargaining has been ``too often blamed forhalting the pace of educational change.'' He contended it is ``apathway to progress'' that can be used to revamp curricula andrestructure schools as well as improve working conditions forteachers.   The 8,500 NEA delegates and several thousand others in attendanceheld a brief indoor rally in support of the Chinese demonstrators inTianamen Square last month. They waved signs imprinted with ``China_ Remember the Students'' and a sketch of the Statue of Liberty, andswayed back and forth arm-in-arm to the strains of ``We ShallOvercome.''   Shenping Feng, a Princeton University graduate student andexecutive director of the China Solidarity Committee, said theChinese people are living under a totalitarian regime that assignsthem jobs and homes, tells them what to think, how many childrenthey can have and when to have them.   ``We want to speak freely,'' he said. ``We want to live withoutfear. We want to walk without being followed, and now we don't wantto be executed (for participating in demonstrations). That's ourunderstanding of democracy.''   NEA President Mary Futrell called on the Chinese government ``toend its strategies of repression and its policies of reprisal'' andexhorted the U.S. government ``to impose the most stringenteconomic, military and political sanctions we can put together.''   The technology report said technology used in the educationprocess should take into account students' different learning stylesand abilities, help students take more responsibility for their owneducation, promote new approaches to learning and encouragecommunications beyond school walls, the report said.   Some ideas outlined in the report included computer pen-pals, arthistory computer disks, videotape collections, oral histories,electronic ``field trips,'' computerized speech therapy and musiccomposition, projects with students in other countries and satellitediscussions with leading international figures.</TEXT></DOC>
