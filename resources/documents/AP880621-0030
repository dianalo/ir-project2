Michael Derek Collins was arrested Saturday for overstaying aone-month visa issued to him last year. Police in Ireland saidCollins was a junior operative in the outlawed IRA during the 1970s.   But police here said Collins is only being held pending animmigration hearing and that no criminal charges are being broughtagainst him.   Police Inspector Bob Guay said summit security forces are payingstrict attention to possible activities by the IRA because of thepresence here of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   But he denied the group is posing a specific threat to Mrs.Thatcher during her stay. ``We have to be ever-mindful of allterrorist groups in the world,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
