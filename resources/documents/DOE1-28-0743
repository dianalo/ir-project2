The long mean (logSD)and range of the bacterial counts were 1690 (2, 37) and 180-8500 cfu/m{sup3} and of the fungal spore counts 70 (2, 86) and 10-340 cfu/m{sup 3}.The impact of children's activities could be seen in all-day monitoring.The bacterial counts were generally higher than those measured in homesor offices. Enhanced ventilation lowered the airborne bacteria levels.</TEXT></DOC>
