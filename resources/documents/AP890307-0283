A spin-off jobaction by pilots nationwide failed to clog airports as feared.   Eastern earlier sent 2,500 more non-union workers home, blamingpilots for leaving it with ``no business on the books.''   ``If the pilots do not come back to work, Eastern Airlines isgone,'' company attorney David Ross said. He warned during a courthearing that Eastern was faced with bankruptcy without its 3,600pilots, who have firmly refused to cross picket lines the Machinistsunion set up Saturday.   U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis denied Eastern's request fora temporary restraining order less than a half hour after thethree-hour hearing.   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes called the ruling ``a victoryof principle; a victory of ethics.''   Later, the pilots union reported that Eastern management calledits negotiators to try to set up new talks. No details wereimmediately available.   ``Basically, we're extremely cautious,'' Stokes said, adding thatno talks had yet been scheduled.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company would appealDavis' ruling immediately to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin Atlanta.   Ross said the company couldn't operate more than 48 to 72 hoursmore without the pilots, and could have to file for federalbankruptcy protection.   Matell said bankruptcy would be ``a course of last resort.'' Hedeclined to speculate on how long it would be before Eastern wouldmake such a move.   Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, already has nearlyshut down, saying it was forced to lay off a total of 9,500 workersthis week because of the pilots' adherence to the strike in a17-month-old contract dispute.   The airline wants $150 million in concessions; the Machinistswant $50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $1billion this decade and $1 million a day before the strike.   The national pilots union had asked its 40,000 members at allairlines to follow rule books stringently starting Tuesday, andthere were fears of havoc as delays piggy-backed around the country.But while the union said 60 percent of its members followed thedirective, delays were few.   ``The reports we have are that there has been no effect onoperations,'' said Capt. Roger Hall, spokesman for the Air LinePilots Association. He said the job action would continue, but hedid not know for how long.   The union contended its action was not a slowdown but an effortto ensure safety during the strike. Transportation Secretary SamuelK. Skinner at a news conference in New York called the effects``sporadic.''   The Federal Aviation Administration said in Washington that ``thesystem so far has operated in a close to normal manner.'' SpokesmanBob Buckhorn said there had been sporadic requests formore-than-usual handling by air traffic controllers ``but the systemhas been able to accommodate those requests.''   President Bush in Washington said pilots should not ``make theinnocent traveling public a pawn,'' and stood by his opposition togovernment intervention to stop the walkout by the 8,500-memberMachinists union, which represents mechanics and ramp serviceworkers.   Skinner appealed to Congress not to force the administration toimpose a 60-day cooling-off period. But a House subcommitteeapproved a union-sought bill Tuesday that would compel Bush tointervene by appointing an emergency board to study the impassebetween the airline and union and recommend a solution. It wouldinclude a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which the strikingemployees would return to work.   The bill is not expected to reach the House floor until sometimenext week, and many lawmakers concede there are not enough votes inCongress to override an expected presidential veto.   Bush said if the Machinists try to shut down rail service laterthis week he will ask Congress to ban such secondary boycotts. Hesaid the strike should be settled through bargaining, but no talksare scheduled.   Secondary boycotts, particularly in the New York metropolitanarea, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people.   Unions representing workers at three suburban New York rail linesTuesday appealed a judge's order issued over the weekend barringthem from honoring any Machinists picket lines set up at railways.An appeals court hearing was set Wednesday, but the lower-courtjudge extended his order, originally set to expire Wednesdayafternoon, through Friday.   Meanwhile, Eastern has just 1,500 employees still working, downfrom 31,200 before the strike, according to Joe Leonard, Easternexecutive vice president and chief operating officer, who announcedanother 2,500 layoffs Tuesday.   ``We simply don't have any business on the books today,'' Leonardsaid. ``Our competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, ourtraffic, since March 4.''   Some union members have speculated that Eastern's owner, TexasAir Corp., and its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, are trying to tear thecarrier apart. Lorenzo's anti-union reputation has galvanizedEastern's unionized employees.   ``One of the problems in this situation and the reason it's goneon for 17 months is Mr. Lorenzo's credibility with his unions isabout as low as you can get,'' Skinner said. ``He thought the pilotswould cross. It's pretty clear to me the pilots had no intention ofcrossing the picket lines.''   Nearly 3,000 Eastern employees jammed Miami's Knight Centerdowntown Tuesday night for a teleconference being carried bysatellite television to 11 other groups across the country.   ``Lorenzo makes Machiavelli look like Gomer Pyle,'' Henry Duffy,president of the Air Line Pilots Association, told the cheeringunion members.   Eastern has contended the pilots, who along with its 5,900 flightattendants have honored the picket lines, are conducting an illegalstrike. But pilots attorney James Linsey said the pilots can honorthe strike under the Railway Labor Act.   Flights were slightly delayed at some airports Tuesday by ALPA'saction, which was to take advantage of the discretion pilots have indeciding preflight and prelanding checks, such as reading flightplans to controllers.   ``Everything's quiet,'' said Mildred Schneider, spokeswoman forthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates thethree major New York-area airports.   ``If there a slowdown here, we can't see it,'' said John Braden,spokesman at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, where Easternhad accounted for 26 percent of the traffic before the strike.   Airports in Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Kansas City,Mo., Phoenix, and Portland, Ore., reported few or no delays. SanFrancisco officials said fog delayed some flights.   In Denver, officials at Stapleton International Airport said thepilots' action delayed some United flights, while ContinentalAirlines flights by non-union pilots flew on schedule.   ``It certainly isn't by accident,'' commented Richard Boulware, aspokesman for the airport.   Eastern has said it would continue only its most profitableroutes _ the shuttle between Washington, New York and Boston, andthree round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, andSantiago, Chile.   Before the strike, Eastern carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040flights daily. On Tuesday, the shuttle was ``running at fullthrottle,'' with all 62 flights, but not with full loads. </TEXT></DOC>
