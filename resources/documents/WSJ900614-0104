Nelson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/14/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11</SO><CO>   EUROP</CO><LP>   BRUSSELS -- Five European Community countries are to signan accord removing all immigration controls among them,allowing people to travel freely in an area covering almosthalf the area of the EC.   The accord -- expected to take full effect by the end of1991 and link France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands andLuxembourg -- was approved by the West German cabinet.Signing ceremonies will be held next Tuesday in a smallLuxembourg village called Schengen, a border village thatgave the accord its name because of its close proximity toneighboring France and Germany.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement is considered important to overall effortsto remove border controls among the EC's twelve membercountries. Removing passport controls has become one of themost concrete symbols of European integration, and could makelife and business much simpler for the millions of people wholive along Continental Europe's copious collection ofborders.   The agreement is the first major international accord thattreats East and West Germany as a single country. The fivecountries had planned to sign the agreement last December,but the West German cabinet refused to approve it because ofconcerns about East Germany.   Now that German unification is no longer in question, thefive nations agreed to include East Germany in territorycovered by the Schengen accord. East German officials helpedin the negotiations, and the participants agreed thatSchengen territory will extend East to the Polish border atthe Oder and Neisse Rivers.   The accord is seen as a major building block for the newarchitecture that the EC hopes will bind the EC nations evercloser in coming years. The Schengen countries will opennegotiations with Italy later this month to bring a sixthcountry into the Schengen group; Spain and Portugal areexpected to try to join soon after.   While full details of the accord won't be released untilTuesday, the agreement does provide for strengthened measuresto fight cross-border crime, drug trafficking and illegalimmigration. It will establish a common list of countriesthat require visas to visit the Schengen countries. Theaccord also will ease some customs controls on goods, thoughcomplete removal of such controls will have to await anEC-wide agreement on value-added-tax harmonization.   The accord still has to be approved by the parliaments ofthe five countries. But public support for the agreement isso strong that most political analysts say they expect thefive countries to race to see which can put it into effectsoonest. When the talks collapsed in December, many Europeanssaw it as a bad sign for the whole European unity movement.&quot;Amazingly, most of the objections seem to have gone away inthe past five months,&quot; said Lieven Lenaerts, SecretaryGeneral of the Benelux Economic Union, which links Belgium,the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and which has been in chargeof the Schengen negotiations.   Nevertheless, the EC's own attempt to remove bordercontrols for people has proved one of the most difficult ofall its plans for a border-free Europe, mainly because ofconcerns about criminals, terrorists and drug dealers.Currently, most European police forces rely on border checksas a major way of fighting crime.   To deal with the crime problem, the Schengen countrieswill create an extensive data network to share informationabout suspected criminals and other police intelligence. Thatsystem, which will be based in Strasbourg, France, shouldcome into full operation by the end of 1991, Mr. Lenaertssaid.   Belgium, which hasn't any law protecting access toelectronic data kept on file about its citizens, has promisedto pass new legislation before the agreement comes into fulleffect.   The Schengen agreement could create new headaches fortravelers outside the five-nation area. The external bordersof the Schengen countries will be more strictly controlledthan national borders are currently, experts say, mainlybecause officials would perform the immigration controls forall the rest of the Schengen countries. But once a person isadmitted to one of the Schengen countries he would be able topass freely throughout the others.   For this reason, most countries on the Continent areexpected to come under heavy pressure from travelers andbusinesses to become signatories to the Schengen accord.</TEXT></DOC>
