A communique issued at the end of the three-day summit said:``The conference stresses its full commitment to extend all supportneeded to secure the continuation and escalation of the uprisingunder the leadership of the PLO.''   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat said heconsidered the outcome of the summit meeting a victory for both hisguerrilla movement and the uprising.   Arafat told a conference the funds alloted for the Palestinianuprising were ``very convenient,'' but he would not disclosefigures.   Eight delegation chiefs, including the four wealthiest nations,devised a formula in a 2{-hour meeting for subsidies to thePalestinians and to Syria and Jordan, which are in the forefront ofthe confrontation with Israel.   In the communique, the 21 Arab League members again designatedthe PLO as the ``sole legitimate representative'' of the 5 millionPalestinians.   They also agreed to oppose any peace initiative that excludesPLO participation and to demand an international peace conferencegiving equal status to all concerned parties, including the PLO.   The communique ``noted the United States' pro-Israeli bias andits hostility toward the Arabs and the Palestinians' legitimaterights,'' and said the summit ``condemned international terrorismin all its forms, especialy Israel's organized terrorism againstthe Palestinian people and the Arabs in general.''   It condemned ``Iranian terrorism,'' accusing Iran of``instigating internal unrest, sabotage and other violence'' in thePersian Gulf nations, and denounced Iran's refusal to end its8-year-old war with Iraq. Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, ``expressedreservations,'' a Syrian source said.   Sources close to the delegates said Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatarand the United Arab Emirates agreed to ``specific sums'' that wouldbe provided for the uprising and to Syria and Jordan.   Chief PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif told reporters, however,that the Arab leaders agreed to keep the precise sums a secret toavoid showing their hand to the Israelis.   Before the report of an agreement, Sharif denied reports thatArab leaders rebuffed the PLO demand for funds to run the uprising.``There is no truth to the report.''   Arafat, the PLO chairman, told the summit earlier in the weekthe rebellion was costing his organization more than $50 million amonth in relief, compensation for wages lost by strikers andmedical expenses for injured rioters.   Conference sources said the PLO agreed in preliminarydiscussions to reduce its annual requirements to $300-$400 million,but spokesmen for the oil-producing nations of the Persian Gulfsaid that still was too high.   Gulf nations will provide funds for the uprising through thePLO, Jordan and a PLO-Jordanian commission on Palestinian affairs,the sources said. They said finances would be reviewed later,possibly at the next regular Arab summit, scheduled for November inSaudi Arabia.   A senior delegate said later, however, that all money for theuprising would go through the PLO. That would underscore therenewed emphasis on the PLO as the sole representative ofPalestinians.   The PLO, Syria and Jordan were expected to get some short-termaid for their own use, but the gulf nations avoided a long-termfinancial commitment. They cited chaos in oil markets thatendangered their main source of revenue.   At a 1978 Arab summit in Iraq, oil states promised the PLO andnations confronting Israel a subsidy of $3 billion spread over 10years. King Hussein of Jordan said in a speech Wednesday he hadreceived only about half the money. Syria and the PLO also havecomplained about unfulfilled promises.   Meanwhile, Syrian President Hafez Assad and Lebanese PresidentAmin Gemayel moved closer toward reconciliation after two meetingsThursday focusing on Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war, sources said.   Assad and Gemayel have been at odds since January 1986, when theLebanese president scuttled a Syrian-brokered accord betweenChristian and Moslem militias. Gemayel was not consulted before thesigning of the agreement.   Syria is the main supporter of Lebanon's Moslems. It has morethan 25,000 troops controlling the main Moslem regions in the northand east as well as west Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
