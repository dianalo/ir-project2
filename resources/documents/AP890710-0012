Corruption seems so deeply rooted and may have gained so manyadherents in Venezuela, the author Arturo Uslar Pietri suggests,that the honest should regarded as fools.   ``Normal in Venezuela is to take advantage of a politicalposition to obtain personal benefits and become rich,'' he said inan interview. ``Those who don't do it are considered inferiors.''   But corruption cases in Venezuela become so entangled that fewcan sort them out and in the end they fade away in a loss ofinterest by a confused public.   The latest case involves elimination of a government agency knownas Recadi, which in the previous government distributed $40 billionfor subsidized imports.   Of that amount, some $6 billion is said to have been grantedfraudulently, mostly by overpricing, personal connections or evenoutright bribery, contributing to the depletion of the nation'smonetary reserves.   In a swirl of charges and counter charges, one figure in thescandal attempted suicide; the leftist past of the judge handlingthe case was brought into play with implications that he is actingfor political reasons; the judge sent an industrialist to jail foreight days for charging that the judge himself took bribes and forblaming the Recadi fraud on a former president and his sweetheartsecretary.   Recadi was created in early 1983 as Venezuela's oil bonanza beganto fade and exchange restrictions were imposed. Cheap dollars werelavishly granted via Recadi to both private and public companies forimports that otherwise would have fueled inflation.   But it soon became a ``nest of corruption ... that waspractically designed for fraud,'' congressional investigators havecharged.   A thorough investigation, however, might take years just to checkthe 14,000 or so companies that received cheap dollars.   In one case, millions of dollars were granted to import Holsteinheifers to improve Venezuela's dairy stock. The heifers turned outnot to be Holsteins but ``scrawny, feeble specimens,'' as onerancher described them.   Hundreds of the heifers were abandoned on a plain to becomecarrion for vultures, the newspaper El Nacional reported.   In another incident, Ana Teresa Herrera was fired as a Recadiinspector when she began investigating a company that had beengranted $14 million to import three airplanes; only one was broughtto Venezuela.   ``And that plane never flew,'' she told reporters aftertestifying before Judge Luis Guillermo de la Riva, who is in chargeof the current Recadi case.   The scandal became a drama when former Development MinisterHector Meneses, whose office also granted cheap dollars for imports,shot himself in the head. He survived but lost the sight of one eyeand remains in a coma in a Caracas hospital, unable to tell what heknows.   Before shooting himself, Meneses wrote a letter to his wifeclaiming innocence and suggesting he had merely carried outinstructions from two of his former colleagues. They, in turn, alsoclaimed innocence.   So far only eight people have been jailed to await trial,although de la Riva has issued 32 arrest warrants.   In a setback for the judge, however, it turned out that most ofsubjects of the warrants had resigned from their business jobs longbefore Recadi was even created and no longer live in Venezuela.   Then de la Riva also came under the fire of critics who recalledthat he had, years before, supported leftist guerrillas. Theimplication was that it was more than coincidence that leftistcongressmen were leading the public outcry in the case.   Another setback for the judge was his order for the arrest ofNicomedes Zuloaga, member of a prominent Venezuelan family andpresident of Gramoven, a grain processing company accused ofimporting overpriced wheat.   Upon turning himself in, Zuloaga noted that he was Venezuela'sambassador to Argentina when the alleged overpricing took place. Afriend, Alfredo Paul Delfino, accused the judge of receiving bribesand charged that former President Jaime Lusinchi and his privatesecretary and companion, Blanca Ibanez, were ``the real thieves.''   De la Riva ordered Delfino to jail for eight days.   Lusinchi, whose affair with Ibanez and his attempt to divorce hiswife of more than 40 years constituted a scandal in his years aspresident, has threatened to file suit against Delfino.   ``In the Recadi case there is a too much transparent classism,''the independent newspaper El Universal said in an editorial. ``Thereare no politicians in jail and the (law's) hand strikes only onbusinessmen whereas the ones to blame for the corruption were withinRecadi.''   As the plot becomes more entangled, many believe that behind thescandal lies a political struggle between Lusinchi and PresidentCarlos Andres Perez, who took office in February, for the leadershipof their Accion Democratica, the biggest in Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
