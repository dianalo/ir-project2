(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge Friday sentenced aformer state auditor general to six years in prison forracketeering and tax fraud related to ``a sickening pattern ofsoliciting, accepting and paying bribes.''   Al Benedict, a one-time gubernatorial hopeful, also was fined$20,000 by U.S. Middle District Senior Judge Malcolm Muir, who saidthe sentence was intended as a deterrent for other public officials.   The judge ordered Benedict to surrender to U.S. marshals onMarch 14.   Benedict, 58, pleaded guilty last month to charges ofracketeering and tax fraud. The racketeering charge encompassed 10state bribery-related charges, which the government said occurredbetween April 1976 and November 1984.   Benedict acknowledged accepting bribes in return for hiring andpromoting state workers and for awarding no-bid contracts. He alsoadmitted making a $6,000 payoff to a lawmaker in return for abigger state appropriation for his department.   ``I could never express to you how I feel ... the pain,suffering, embarrassment, humiliation,'' Benedict said in court.``All I can attempt to do is atone for my transgressions and sins.''   Benedict refused to answer reporters' questions as he left thecourthouse. His lawyer, Arthur Goldberg, said Benedict wassurprised but not angered by the sentence.   He could have been sentenced to up to 23 years in prison and$125,000 in fines. Federal prosecutors asked for a light sentence,citing Benedict's cooperation in a continuing investigation ofstate-government corruption.   The defense, in a memorandum filed by Goldberg, asked for aone-year sentence with early parole and a term of public service.   The memorandum portrays Benedict, a former televisioncommentator who became de facto head of the state Democratic Partyduring two terms as auditor general, as a broken, humiliated man.   It also places the blame for Benedict's predicament on hisformer top aide, John Kerr, who was convicted of masterminding thejob-selling scheme. Kerr was sentenced to two to five years inprison and remains free on bail. He led investigators to Benedictlate in 1986.   Among the spectators at the sentencing was Joanne Dwyer, widowof state Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer. Her husband killed himself duringa news conference last year, one day before he was to be sentencedby Muir on bribery-conspiracy charges.   She criticized the plea-bargaining system that allowed Benedictto shorten his prison term and said her husband never got a chanceto bargain because he was innocent and had been framed.</TEXT></DOC>
