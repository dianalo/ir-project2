Department officials cited a $6.6 million budget shortfall lastmonth in proposing to sharply curtail the ``Essential Air Service''program. Under the program, the federal government subsidizesflights to and from 155 small cities that would probably nototherwise have air service because the routes are not moneymakers.   DOT originally said it hoped the cuts could take effect on March1, following a public comment period. But the plan was swiftlyattacked by lawmakers, and the department said Wednesday it yielded``in response to requests from members of Congress.''   ``Because the shortage is only $6.6 million, I thought there wasa very good chance that Congress would restore the money to avoidthe loss of airline service,'' Rep. Bob Davis, R-Mich., saidWednesday. ``The major problem was the timing.''   Now that the program has been given a 60-day reprieve, Sen.Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said, ``I believe that additional funds can befound within the budget, and it would be premature for theTransportation Department to disrupt essential air service withoutexploring the opportunities for supplemental funds.''   Despite the postponement of the cuts, Sen. Jay Rockefeller,D-W.Va., said he still planned to introduce a resolution asking thedepartment to keep the subsidies intact until Congress can come upwith the $6.6 million.   He and Byrd said the subsidies were critical to West Virginia'seconomic growth.   But DOT warned that action must come soon because the longer theprogram proceeds at current financing levels, the harder it will beto achieve savings later.   ``If the funding issue is not resolved by early June, a notice toall subsidized Essential Air Service carriers will be necessaryindicating that no funds will be available beyond mid-July,'' thedepartment said.   The department had earlier proposed four likely plans for copingwith the cuts. One of them, considered the harshest by some, wouldcut 53 cities out of the program. One-third of those cities are morethan 100 miles from the next nearest airport.   States that would have been hit particularly hard by the cutbacksincluded Arizona, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
