Both sides haveheld their fire, but another struggle has been taking place in theform of a public relations war, complete with communiques,satellite TV and news conferences.   How good a job has the U.S. news media done in sorting it allout? The Associated Press checked with six specialists for theiropinions on that element of the conflict. Here are their responses:</TEXT><HEAD>EVERETTE E. DENNIS, executive director, Gannett Center for</HEAD><TEXT>   Media Studies:</TEXT><TEXT>   There is a tendency for the story of this crisis to follow twotracks _ one a story of global political intrigue, another a moraltale of right and wrong, of hero and villain. Either courseobscures the fact that the presence of American troops in SaudiArabia (and, of course, Iraqi troops in Kuwait) is essentially aneconomic story: At issue is the world's oil supply, and not leastthe United States'. . . .   The media try to map out the issues, to explain who the partiesare and what they are saying, to assay interests and motivations. .. . (But) the press soon goes beyond the story of global politicsto the people on the ground, the naval and military personnel whoultimately fight a war if there is to be one. Whilewell-intentioned, this coverage sometimes serves only to trivializethe larger issues.   At the same time, however, some of that coverage leads us toquestion precisely what and who we are fighting for and whether theprice of American lives is worth paying. Recently some journalistshave begun to probe at these points, but if previous conflicts areany guide, the larger prospect for the press is not encouraging.</TEXT><HEAD>MARTIN A. LEE, co-author of ``Unreliable Sources: A Guide To</HEAD><TEXT>   Detecting Bias In News Media'' and co-founder of the group Fairnessandamp; Accuracy in Reporting:</TEXT><TEXT>   Good journalism is supposed to show at least two sides of anissue, but coverage of the Gulf crisis has been very one-sided.U.S. news media have allowed Bush supporters to virtually drown outarticulate critics of his Persian Gulf policy.   Instead of asking tough questions, we've seen too much mediacheerleading and saber-rattling on behalf of the president.Supposedly neutral reporting has often given way to worshipfulprose about the ``masterful leadership'' of the commander-in-chief.   Reporters ought to be raising the real issues. Doesn't Bush'srhetoric about ``Saddam controlling the oilfields'' ring hollowwhen OPEC, in cahoots with Western oil companies, would continue tofix prices? Is it worth risking 10,000 American lives for the emirof Kuwait, who owns nearly as many wives as Imelda Marcos hasshoes? Should U.S. soldiers be deployed in support of theanti-democratic Saudi regime which tortures its own people?   Amid all the talk about Saddam Hussein's ``naked aggression''and ``trampling of international law,'' media pundits have rarelyuttered the ``p'' word: ``Panama.'' Bush's invasion violatedinternational law just as much as Saddam's invasion, but one wouldnever know that from the U.S. media.</TEXT><HEAD>REID COLLINS, CNN anchor in Washington:</HEAD><TEXT>   I think we've been having a difficult time in reaching thepublic with the longevity of this commitment. We haven't been toocareful about explaining what seems to be a long period ofcontinued Western presence in a fairly hostile environment. Ifthere is anything remiss, it may be that.   I don't think (criticism of excess coverage of Saddam) isfounded. It is imperative to know thine enemy, if you want to putit on a strictly partisan basis. It's a matter of degree _ therecomes a time when the seventh interview of Saddam Hussein becomessuspect.   We are now trying to figure out `how did we get there?' Therehas been some exposition of the roots of this thing, the historicalproblems that beset Kuwait and its relations to Iraq. We haven'tlooked into this as much as we should. ...   The hostages invariably take over the news and they become whatI imagine what Saddam Hussein wants them to become, one of theprimary issues. The administration has been forced to do its utmostto downplay the hostages.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
