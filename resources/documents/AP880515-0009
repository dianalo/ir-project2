(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inmates at an overcrowded state prisonheld three guards hostage Saturday following a fiery uprising thatleft one dormitory gutted and two others damaged, officials said.One guard and one inmate were injured.   Eight guards were grabbed by 10 prisoners when the disturbancebegan, but five hostages were released unharmed Saturday and theothers were reported in good condition, said officials at themedium-security Mack Alford Correctional Center.   The inmates, believed to be armed with crude knives, threatenedto kill their hostages if authorities attempted a rescue, saidJerry Massie, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.   ``One inmate is keeping it going,'' said prison spokeswomanAnita Trammell. ``I think the inmates are tired. We have oneleader. I think if it wasn't for the leader, things would have beenclosed up.''   The uprising began late Friday after some inmates accused othersof theft and threatened retaliation, authorities said. A group ofthe inmates was being prepared for transfer to a maximum-securityprison when they seized hostages.   ``They released the (fifth) hostage in return for getting totalk to two specific negotiators,'' said Massie. He would notidentify the negotiators.   Officials said the inmates had ``a short list'' of specificdemands, but refused to disclose what they were.   ``I think their primary concern is for their safety and theirwell-being,'' Massie said. ``It's just real non-specific. It's notlike a list of `We want better food or better water.' ''   ``We're fine. They're feeding us. They're taking care of us,''one hostage was quoted as saying when inmates permitted him to makea telephone call.   The 33-year-old red-brick prison was surrounded by OklahomaHighway Patrol tactical teams in camouflage clothing, rifle-totingcorrections department officers and firetrucks that were used tobattle blazes in three buildings.   Officers carrying teargas launchers donned bullet-proof vests ina parking lot and huddled around blueprints of the prison. Butofficials wouldn't say if that activity signaled any impendingaction.   ``That's what you call contingency planning,'' said patrolspokesman Lt. Stewart Meyer.   A spokesman said Gov. Henry Bellmon had no plans to call in theNational Guard to assist the law officers already on hand.   The inmates started a fire that destroyed the east dormitory atthe Mack Alford Correctional Center, then moved to anotherdormitory with their hostages, Massie said.   ``If we were to rebuild the dormitory that was destroyed similarto one we have at our Lexington facility, it would cost about $2.5million,'' Massie said, adding that it was too early to estimatedamage to the other dormitories or other prison areas.   Smoke was still rising from the roof of the torched dormitorySaturday; fires in two other dormitories were doused.   Authorities sealed off a section of the prison that held 82inmates.   ``Ten of the 82 are participating in the hostage situation ...the others just got caught inside,'' said Ms. Trammell. Thirty to35 of the uninvolved inmates locked themselves in their cells, shesaid.   Trammell said one guard was treated after apparently being hiton the hand with a rock, and one prisoner suffered a minor stabwound to the shoulder.   Officers were preparing to transfer five inmates to the OklahomaState Penitentiary in McAlester, about 40 miles away, when thedisturbance began. The five had reportedly threatened other inmateswho allegedly had stolen from them.   ``Apparently, during that period of time, an officer was takenhostage,'' Massie said. Other officers then were seized.   More than 500 inmates were evacuated from the prison'sdormitories and held in a yard behind a fence topped with razorwire. Many were being transferred to other facilities throughoutthe state.   An offer to transport the inmates involved in the uprising tothe federal prison at El Reno, Okla., apparently was rejected lateSaturday, Ms. Trammell said.   Family members of some of the hostages gathered at a secludedarea outside the facility in rural southeastern Oklahoma near theTexas border, 130 miles southeast of Oklahoma City.   Mack Alford, with 652 inmates, has the sixth-largest prisonpopulation in Oklahoma but has an operational capacity of 492,Massie said. The prison opened in 1955, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
