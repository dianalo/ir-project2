Milken is scheduled to deliver the keynote address next week at afinancial industry black-tie dinner honoring the ``chief executiveofficers of the decade'' as selected by Financial World magazine,spokesman Kenneth Lerer said.   Milken was named in a Securities and Exchange Commission civilsuit against Drexel last September in connection with securitiesfraud charges that included insider trading. He is expected to beindicted on criminal fraud and racketeering charges.   Milken has headed Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., ``junk'' bondfinancing department since the mid-1970s and is credited withturning the low-cost, high-yield securities into a $175 billionannual market. The bonds often are used to finance takeovers and thegrowth of small- to medium-sized companies.   Lerer said Milken last spoke in New York at a business luncheonin December, several weeks before terms of Drexel's plea deal withthe government settling criminal charges against were announced.   Under the deal, Drexel agreed to pay $650 million in fines andrestitution and plead guilty to six felonies. The deal is pending aseparate settlement with the SEC on civil charges.   Milken, who has denied any wrongdoing, recently asked a federaljudge in Manhattan to modify or throw out the agreement on thegrounds it violates his rights. Drexel agreed in the deal to dismissMilken and withhold his 1988 compensation of well over $100 million.   Lerer said Milken is working part-time at Drexel while preparinghis legal defense. He said Milken also regularly attends charity andfinancial community dinners. He is not scheduled to receive an awardat the New York dinner.</TEXT></DOC>
