Earnings for Occidental Petroleum Corp., with interests inoil, chemicals, gas transmission, coal and agribusiness,jumped 65%, a sign that its restructuring is paying off, thecompany said. Meanwhile, Amerada Hess Corp. recorded a profitcompared with a loss.</LP><TEXT>   Crude oil prices were $2 to $3 a barrel higher in thesecond quarter compared with the year-earlier period, whichbenefited the oil production operations of all fourcompanies. But natural gas prices in the U.S. were sharplylower. Mobil said it sold gas for an average of $1.45 athousand cubic feet, 21 cents less than last year's depressedlevel.   The weak national economy has reduced gasoline demand,which in turn has hurt refining margins. Higher prices forcrude, the feedstock for gasoline, also lowered refiningmargins. Chemical operations have been weak for some timebecause of overcapacity combined with weak demand.   The results were generally in line with Wall Streetexpectations and followed the same pattern as Amoco Corp. andAtlantic Richfield Co., which earlier this week reportedsharp declines in second-quarter profits. In compositetrading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Mobil stockfell 25 cents a share to $67.25 a share, Phillips dropped 75cents to $26.125, Occidental shed 37.5 cents to $22.375 andHess lost $1.125 to $54.50.                                                                                                          MOBIL                                                                                                          The Fairfax, Va., company said the latest quarter includes$44 million from asset sales. The 1990 quarter includesone-time gains of $70 million. Without the special items,earnings fell 6%. Revenue rose 4.6% to $14.45 billion from$13.82 billion.   Mobil said U.S. exploration and production profits totaled$34 million, an improvement of $62 million from last year,because of higher crude prices and a 5% increase in oilproduction. The rise came despite extremely low prices fornatural gas in the U.S. Mobil said it restricted gasproduction and postponed a portion of its gas developmentprogram.   Overseas exploration and production earnings were flat ashigher crude and gas prices and increased production wereoffset by sharply higher exploration expenses in so-calledfrontier areas.   Overall, Mobil said it had $1.1 billion of capital andexploration expenditures in the second quarter, $221 millionmore than last year.   In the first quarter Mobil and other major oil companieswith large international refining operations had big earningsincreases as overseas refining margins were unusually wide.The gap has narrowed to normal levels and in the secondquarter Mobil said foreign refining results were onlyslightly better than a year earlier. In the U.S. Mobil'srefining and marketing profits fell sharply.                                                                                                          PHILLIPS                                                                                                          The Bartlesville, Okla., company said the latest quarterincludes a $17 million loss related to the early retirementof highcost debt and a $9 million loss from foreign currencytransactions. A year earlier Phillips had a $5 million gainfrom currency transactions. Without one-time items, profitfell 58%. Revenue rose 9.2% to $3.25 billion from $2.98billion.   In addition to depressed gasoline refining margins,Phillips was hurt by a fire in April at its Sweeny, Texas,refinery. Because of the lost output of petroleum products,Phillips had to buy more gasoline on the open market.   Exploration and production earnings rose because of highercrude prices and higher foreign natural gas revenues. Theywere partially offset by lower domestic gas prices and higherforeign exploration expenses. Chemical profits fell by morethan half, to $44 million from $102 million.

Occidental also had a $12 million income tax gainin the quarter. A year earlier, the company had a $41 milliongain from the sale of U.S. oil and gas properties and a $20million gain from a tax benefit. Without one-time items,profit rose 79% to $50 million from $28 million. Sales fell1.3% to $5.06 billion from $5.12 billion.   Occidental said it will use proceeds from the coal minesale, the sale of North Sea oil interests in early July andthe planned closing this quarter of the sale of its domesticnatural gas liquids business to reduce debt.

Revenue rose 16% to $1.43 billion from $1.23billion.   Hess said its refining and marketing operations recorded asmall profit of $3.8 million compared with a loss of $44.3million a year earlier. Exploration and production earningssurged to $36.7 million from $3.7 million.   The company said it had capital expenditures of $437.4million in the quarter, more than double the $192 millionspent a year earlier.   ---                               1991            1990                           in      per      in     per   %                        millions  share  millions share chg.
