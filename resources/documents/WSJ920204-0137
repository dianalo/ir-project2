These short-term world income funds invest inhigh-yielding government and corporate bills and notes issuedin exotic locales: 14% in Finland, 13.3% in Spain, 12.875% inAustralia. Most then try to hedge against a decline in thosecurrencies' value against the dollar. The goal is to beat theyields on U.S. money market funds by one or two percentagepoints annually.</LP><TEXT>   The assets of short-term world income funds have soared tomore than $20 billion today from under $500 million in 1989.The two biggest sponsors, Alliance Capital Management L.P.and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., have sold $13 billion of such fundscarrying loads, or sales charges, of as much as 3% of assets.   These funds may deserve a niche-but only a niche-assupplements to certificates of deposit and other fixed-incomeinvestments for sophisticated investors who understand thesudden moves in currencies and interest rates.   But many other investors, who are buying these funds asmoney-market fund substitutes, may be making a mistake. Theshare price-or net asset value-of money funds normally staysconstant; money funds invest in short-term securitiesdenominated in dollars.   But investors in short-term world income funds not onlyare taking currency risks, they are also taking aninterest-rate risk. The average maturity of the portfolio ofworld income funds-one or two years is much longer than theaverage money fund. If the dollar goes up, or interest ratesgo up, investors could lose money as the funds' asset valuesinks.   That happened last year to unlucky investors in some ofthe worst-performing short-term world income funds.   Take the $45 million Equitable ShortTerm World IncomeFund. Its total return for 1991-including interest income andprice changes-was a less-than-sizzling 0.72%. Investors whopaid the fund's 3% sales charge thus had a return of %negative andamp; 2.3%. In a start-up mode early last year, the funddidn't fully hedge its foreign-currency positions, accordingto Equitable Executive Vice President Zane Brown. So itincurred losses when the dollar surged last spring.   Or how about the $174 million Pilgrim Global Short-TermMulti-Market Income Fund? Its investors took a loss of 4% inthe fourth quarter. Anthony DeAngelis, a spokesman forPilgrim Group, would say only, &quot;To comment on one month or aquarter is silly.&quot;   On average, short-term world income funds did outpacemoney funds' returns in 1991, 7.37% to 5.67%, according toLipper Analytical Services Inc. Some of that differencestemmed from falling interest rates that boosted the assetvalue of the world funds.   But the variation in returns among the 41 short-term worldincome funds was far greater than among traditional moneyfunds. The difference between the highest and lowest-yieldingmoney funds was only 2.24 percentage points; for the worldfunds, the difference in returns was a whopping 15.5percentage points. Of the two biggest world funds, Merrill'sreturned 6.28%, Alliance's 8.75%.   Some of these funds, such as the $400 million ScudderShort Term Global Income Fund, operate by hedging part oftheir portfolios and making other bets on currency moves. Twoother fund operators, Fidelity Investments and ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc., have small single-currency fundsdesigned as currency plays. Both the Shearson and Fidelityyen funds had total 1991 returns of about 15% vs. 6% fortheir German mark funds. Such funds, though potentially veryvolatile, are better for investors who want to diversify awayfrom the U.S. dollar without incurring the potential costs ofhedging.   What makes short-term world income funds particularlytricky is that many use cross-hedging. If they hedged theirhigh-yielding foreign investments directly against thedollar, they would hedge away all the extra returns. Instead,they try to get a cheaper hedge with a lower-yielding foreigncurrency that should move in tandem with the high-yieldcurrency.   Robert Sinche, manager of the Alliance Short-TermMulti-Market Trust, explained that in mid-January, short-termU.S. yields were 4%, compared with 10.5% in the UnitedKingdom and 9.5% in Germany. Mr. Sinche said he could pick upan extra one percentage point over U.S. rates with thefollowing strategy:   Buy British notes at 10.5%; then hedge against a declinein the British pound by selling German marks against thedollar. The hedge would cost the fund 5.5 percentage pointsof yield-the difference between holding dollar investmentsyielding 4% and paying 9.5% to borrow the marks. Subtract the5.5-point hedge cost from the 10.5% British yield and, voila,you get a yield of 5%-a premium of one percentage point overthe U.S. money market fund rate.   All clear?   These funds are obviously difficult to run. Cross-hedgingis inexact. Several funds stumbled last fall when Finland, ina surprise move, devalued the high-yielding markka by 12%against other European currencies. That hit the $1 billionBlanchard Short-Term Global Income Fund especially hard.Blanchard had 12% of its assets in Finnish markkas that weresupposed to be hedged by German marks. So the fund's returnfor the fourth quarter was only 0.18%. And that held itstotal 1991 return to a below-average 6.58%.   Blanchard sells its fund aggressively as &quot;Designed forinvestors seeking . . . higher yields than money market fundsor certificates of deposit.&quot; Not until page four of a glossybrochure does Blanchard warn that the fund &quot;is not a moneymarket fund and its share price will fluctuate.&quot;   A marketing brochure by Merrill Lynch is a little clearer,but it is just as obviously targeted at dissatisfiedmoney-fund investors. It says the Merrill Lynch Short-TermGlobal Income Fund offers &quot;higher yields than those availableon fixed-price money market funds.&quot;   Catherine Gillis, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., aChicago-based mutual-fund research concern, says short-termworld income funds &quot;make a lot of sense in terms ofdiversification in a fixed-income portfolio. But it's wrongto consider them money-market substitutes.&quot;   Some other mutual-fund operators like Dreyfus Corp. havedecided against offering such funds because, as DreyfusPresident Joseph DiMartino puts it, &quot;We're just a little bituncomfortable taking on that risk.&quot; The funds have grown, henoted, in a period when the dollar has been declining. &quot;Sofar, it's been a one-way street. But how is this going toperform when the dollar gets stronger?&quot; The same point alsoapplies to interest rates, which have been falling, and soboosting the principal value of the funds' holdings.   Alliance's Mr. Sinche agrees short-term world income fundsaren't the place to put one's entire short-term savings. Heargues they deserve to represent 20% to 25% of a portfolio oflonger-term CDs and the like. He says the funds are meant for&quot;investors who are traditionally CD buyers who are willing totake some additional risk to try to get some additionalincome.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
