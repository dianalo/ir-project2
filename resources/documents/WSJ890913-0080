The decision on the D-5 missile follows a recent series of embarrassing failures in tests of the weapon system, and while expressing continued support for the program, appropriators in both houses have been worried by the missile's performance. A House-passed bill this summer fully funded the estimated $1.8 billion sought by the Pentagon for procurement, but the chairman of the House defense subcommittee yesterday indicated he is open to the Senate cuts given continued restraints on total defense spending.    &quot;We're looking more and more at that,&quot; said Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.). &quot;Something like the D-5 could fall out.&quot;    Development of the high-speed space plane depends on the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but the ambitious project ran short in both areas. Neither the Senate defense subcommittee nor an appropriations panel covering NASA approved any of the administration's request. Though the House has allocated an estimated $383 million for the program, this total is certain to be cut in conference between the chambers.    The pressure for reductions reflects the continued budget difficulties facing the appropriations process, and while restoring funds for many of the major weapon systems sought by the administration, the Senate defense subcommittee was forced to move money away from faster-spending operations accounts favored by the House.    The final product, which would appropriate $279.6 billion for the Pentagon in the year beginning Oct. 1, closely mirrors the recommendations of the Senate Armed Services Committee to preserve funds for such major systems as the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter, and the MX and Midgetman missiles cut by the House. Apart from the Lockheed Corp. D-5, the chief exception may be in the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, where spending would be held to $3.7 billion, or significantly below the Senate-authorized level.    More controversy may come with a floor amendment, backed by the subcommittee, to add $8.5 billion to the bill for a set of initiatives not yet authorized. These include $1 billion for ships and tankers to expand the Navy's sealift capability, and $1.69 billion to buy what would be the Army's final 174 Apache helicopters from McDonnell Douglas Corp.    The Apache funding, which would be made available over a two-year period, is in neither the administration's request nor the House-passed bill. Although influential senators are behind the plan, it comes at a time when the panel finds itself endorsing cuts from other aircraft accounts, including the Navy's F-14D fighter and CH-53 heavy helicopter as well as the C-17 cargo plane and the V-22 tilt-rotor Marine Corps transport.    The action on the Pentagon budget came as another Senate subcommittee separately approved an estimated $67 billion in fiscal 1990 appropriations for federal housing, space and veterans programs. NASA funding would be increased an estimated $1.66 billion to accommodate $1.85 billion for the new space station. And while the space plane was stricken from the budget, the committee preserved at least early funding of $20 million for the ambitious Craf Cassini program -- a follow-up to the recently celebrated Voyager mission.    The subcommittee matched House-passed increases of almost $2.4 billion in spending for the troubled Department of Housing and Urban Development and added significantly elsewhere to House totals -- already above the president's requests -- for the Environmental Protection Agency.    This generosity masked a series of budget devices to stay within outlay ceilings and, more than ever, the panel resorted to restrictions delaying the impact of spending next year.    For example, an estimated $140 million for EPA abatement accounts would be available for spending only in the last weeks of the fiscal year. In another case, the panel would lift the $110,000 cap on FHA-insured mortgages for single-family homes. Mortgages would still be limited to 95% of the median cost of a home in the sales area, but the result would be to make more mortgages available in high-cost areas and thereby stimulate a rush of application fees -- helping to offset the deficit temporarily. </TEXT></DOC>
