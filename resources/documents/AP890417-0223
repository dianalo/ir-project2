(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Glen McGlothin, who sings with a rock'n' roll band when he's not barbering or mayoring, dances aroundthe chair as he clips a patron's hair and talks about Ferriday'sfamous four.   A sign on the edge of town reminds you that Ferriday is ``Homeof Jerry Lee Lewis, Mickey Gilley, Jimmy Swaggart and Howard K.Smith.''   The latter, of course, is the network TV anchorman. But thebarbershop gossip this day is mostly about the others, the threecousins who left this Mississippi River town of 4,000 folks andtook separate routes to make their mark in rock 'n' roll, countrymusic and TV evangelism.   ``There's a lot of disappointment in this town,'' saysMcGlothin, referring to the furor surrounding Swaggart who wasdefrocked by the Assemblies of God Church in 1988 after a NewOrleans prostitute said the evangelist had paid her to pose nudefor him. Swaggart refused a denominational order to stay out of thepulpit for a year. In January a New Orleans stripper, MaryCatherine Kampen, made similar allegations against Swaggart inPenthouse magazine.   ``You may not agree with him on his thinking,'' says McGlothin,a member of a clan that grew up with the three famous cousins. ``Hegot pretty bad down on the Catholics for a while, and the Baptists.But a lot of people thought he was a good Christian man. And I'mnot going to say he ain't.   ``I'm not in the judging business. God does a pretty good job ofjudging. The Bible says he who is without sin can cast the firststone. Well, I couldn't throw a pebble.''   The woman who made the accusations in Penthouse, he says, ``isat least pretty. That other girl, though, she was ugly. Just pureugly.''   The mayor-barber perks up when asked about Jerry Lee Lewis, therock 'n' roll legend whose life story is depicted in a new movietitled ``Great Balls of Fire'' due for release in late June.   ``I was just a tad when Jerry Lee lived in town,'' says the42-year-old McGlothin. ``He was cocky but he said he would make itbig one day. I'd listen to him rattle that piano and say to myselfthat I would, too.''   When McGlothin was about 21 and ready to try the big time, theArmy grabbed him.   ``It was Christmas Eve 1967 when I got drafted,'' he says.``Boy, was I mad. Two LSU football players and I were getting thephysical. I'm telling you, these boys were big. They could knockwalls down and eat nails. They flunked the physical. Me, I wasdried up, 140 pounds, and passed.   ``The next thing I knew, I was in the 1st Cavalry in Vietnam andthey made me point man on patrol. I still don't know who dislikedme so much.''   Doing a jitterbug step around his barber chair, McGlothin sighsand concedes that even if the Army hadn't intervened, he stillwouldn't have made it as lead singer in a big-time band.   ``I had the stardust like a lot of kids around here who werepoor and saw how Jerry Lee and Mickey made it,'' he says. ``But Inever had what it takes to make it big. Jerry Lee had that thing.He could make you jump out of a seat and dance. That's the thingthat sells records.''   Gilley, well-known in country music circles, became nationallyknown when the movie ``Urban Cowboy'' featured the nightclub``Gilley's'' in Pasadena, Texas, outside Houston. Gilley waspart-owner of the club, which is now closed.   The mayor's band, Fast Eddie and the Partyrockers, does allright around Ferriday and Natchez, across the river in Mississippi.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
