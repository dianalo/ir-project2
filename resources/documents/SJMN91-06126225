They had Dwight Gooden coming at them the nextday, so it was no time to slip up.;    It was all set up perfectly, and thenBrantley gave up back-to-back solo pinch-hit homers to Mackey Sasser and MarkCarreon. Then, three innings later, bullpen trainee Mike LaCoss surrendered atwo-run homer to Howard Johnson for the latest indignity. Is a 1-11 trip outof the question?;    &quot;That was a bad feeling, especially after the way weplayed the game,&quot; Brantley said. &quot;We battled and stayed ahead the whole game,and you come in like that and give up two homers. It pretty much stinks.&quot;;   Brantley continues an unexpected and untimely struggle -- he has given upseven hits and five runs in 3 1/3 innings over his last three outings. But ifthe day's master plan had been followed, he would not have been pitching inthe ninth.;    After a solid outing by Burkett (seven innings, seven hits),Brantley came in to pitch the eighth. He struck out the first two batters andsurvived a single. The Giants had their Nos. 6, 7 and 8 hitters coming up inthe ninth, and if one of them got on, Manager Roger Craig was going topinch-hit for Brantley and let Dave Righetti close in that inning.;    But theside was retired in order, Jose Uribe completing an 0-for-4 day that counteredhis brilliant defense and dropped his average to an almost unplayable .077.Brantley stayed for the ninth, and the first two batters tied it. The lasttime two N.L. pinch-hitters homered back-to-back was in July 1975, when WillieCrawford and Lee Lacy did it for Los Angeles in a game against St. Louis.Oddibe McDowell and Darrell Porter did it for Texas in September 1986.;   Righetti replaced Brantley after the homers and continued to live up to hisfour-year, $10 million price tag. He carried the Giants to the 11th, andLaCoss made it through 1 2/3 innings before being bombed, a continuation ofhis miseries.;    &quot;As fate would have it right now, it goes out of theballpark,&quot; LaCoss said. &quot;If you're going well, (Johnson) pops it up.&quot;;    TheGiants are not going well, though, as one could tell from the usual scene inCraig's office. General Manager Al Rosen sits alongside each day as Craigfields questions and gives the same cliches. The answers are nearly identicalto the ones given during last year's bad start, but the pressure is greaternow.;    &quot;I don't know how things can get any tougher,&quot; Craig said.&quot;Everything I've seen on this trip has been unbelievable. Now you see whymanagers get old.&quot;;  HOW THEY SCORED;    Giants 1st -- Felder singled. McGeegrounded out, moving Felder to second. With two out, Mitchell singled, scoringFelder.
