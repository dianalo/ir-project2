The Time Warner system will start modestly, reaching only5,000 to 10,000 homes in two neighborhoods in the Queenssection of New York City by year end. But executives toutedit as the first step in a nationwide move toward fiber-opticsystems that will give viewers a dizzying array ofprogramming and at-home services such as banking andtelevised education.</LP><TEXT>   The fiber-optic approach also would clear the way fordigital, high-definition television later in the 1990s. Butit also may put the nation's largest cable operators on acollision course with telephone companies, since the newtechnology's ability to carry a vast range of data couldeasily encompass phone service.   Most cable companies, including Time Warner, have highdebt and face tight credit markets that could make heavycapital expenditures on new technology difficult now. Butfiber optic's low cost was one of the bigger advantagesballyhooed by Time Warner's co-chief executives, Steven J.Ross and Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., at a news conferenceyesterday. They said installing fiber-optic features wouldadd only 10% to 20% to the cost of &quot;upgrading&quot; a local cablesystem, a common practice required by local governments toexpand the number of channels the systems carry. In Queens,the fiber-optic system will cost Time Warner only an extra$50 per household, Mr. Nicholas said in an interview.   &quot;The investment will pay for itself in a year,&quot; Mr.Nicholas added, contending that offering viewers in Queens150 channels of programming will persuade new subscribers tosign up, bringing in new revenue.   But the question looms whether television viewers, alreadyzapping their way through cable systems that boast 36 to 75channels, are anxious to wade through 150 channels. Indeed,the Time Warner system in Queens will be able to offer 150channels even before &quot;compression&quot; techniques that couldexpand the offering to 600 channels.   &quot;This is our `Field of Dreams,'&quot; said Gerald Levin, TimeWarner's vice chairman, referring to the visionary motionpicture. &quot;When we build it, the programming will come.&quot;   Added Mr. Ross: &quot;Right now, within two years we could haveup to 600 channels, and there's no doubt that we could putthem to use.&quot; Such a large capacity would let different homesorder different programming and watch pay-per-view moviesthat start every few minutes.   The fiber-optic portion of a cable system would accountfor only 15% of the total cost; the remainder would go totransmit signals to neighborhoods and individual homes usingalready existing coaxial cable that doesn't have to bereplaced.   The cable industry claims it would have to spend $4billion to switch over to fiber-optic technology and that thetelephone industry would have to spend $200 billion toreplace home telephone wiring with fiber-optic lines. But aBellSouth spokesman countered that the cost of fiber optichas plunged in two years, and &quot;presumably whatever technologythey have come up with, we could use it somehow.&quot;   Other cable companies may follow Time Warner's move.Comcast Cable Communications Inc.'s vice president ofstrategic planning, Mark Coblitz, said: &quot;When Time Warnersays it's going to be first, they probably are. That's great.We'll look forward to seeing how that's going to work out.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
