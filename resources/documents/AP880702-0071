ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Alexander Flax left the Pentagon in 1969after six years as the Air Force's research and development chief,he asked the military's top lawyer what consulting work he couldproperly do on the outside and what he could not.   ``I had a test when I was in the Pentagon which was `I'm nevergoing to do anything here I don't want to see in writing on thefront page tomorrow,''' Flax says. ``That's a pretty good test.''   Flax is a defense consultant, a member of a large anddiversified profession that's become as indispensable to themarriage of government and industry as programs and spending. Hisline of work is technical consulting, which he says, is far removedfrom the world of bribery and corruption that's currently in theheadlines.   Others who are closer to that world are reluctant to talk aboutit on the record. ``You can make a good living very honestly inthis business,'' one said. ``That's why I don't understand thesepeople.''   The FBI's view of some of ``these people'' was revealed inaffidavits filed in court on June 14 to support FBI searches of theoffices of consultants, contractors and a few Pentagon offices:   ``The evidence developed in the investigation has shown thatconsultants often are the ones who:   ``1. obtain information and documents from government officialswhich should not be released to the companies and provide thoseitems to the companies.   ``2. speak to the government officials about doing something tobenefit particular companies and   ``3. provide government officials with bribes and gratuities.''   One type of consultant gives advice to companies on governmentrelations, looking at their strategic plan for the next half dozenyears and seeing whether that plan matches what the governmentneeds.   They advise on simple things.   ``One time a company wanted to do a briefing for congressmeninterested in a particular weapon,'' one consultant said. ``Theywanted to have lunch, arranged in a downtown hotel miles fromCapitol Hill. I told them a congressman isn't going down to 14thStreet, he doesn't have time. If you are going to do apresentation, it's got to be within a few blocks of the Capitol.''   For such advice, he said, a consultant might earn $1,000 a daywhenever he works. But he can be called on for far more difficulttasks.   ``I've got a client who specializes in selling things overseas.He had a question as to policies in a particular area of NATO,about how countries procure different things,'' said oneconsultant, who asked not to be named. ``I found a man in thePentagon who is responsible for setting policy in that area andasked if I could bring that manufacturer in and let him clarify. Inthat case, it was a liaison function.''   In some cases, consultant is just another name for lobbyist. Themilitary producer depends on contacts with the Pentagon and withCongress. The consultant gives strategic advice about whom toapproach and how and when to make that approach.   ``I never tell my client that I can get a congressman to take astand to support their position one way or another,'' theconsultant said. ``I say I can get you to present your side of thecase.''   And, he added, ``I would never dream of going in to acongressman saying `Support this as a favor to me.' I say, `Thereare two sides to every story. There is a problem here betweenservices. This is one possible solution. Let me give you thisside.' And I always tell him what my client's interest is.''   Flax, an aeronautical engineer with a distinguished record,said, ``No one ever told me, `Look, I have just been hired bycompany X to get them this contract.' It's never stated that way.''   Most former Pentagon hands who become consultants on the outsidestart with knowledge of who buys weapons for the government andwhat general programs are under way. They can keep up with changesjust by reading newspapers and trade magazines.   ``One little on-line squib that says Joe Doaks has just beenreplaced by John Brown in that office is very meaningful to him,''Flax said. ``He knows where Brown came from, knows what hischaracter is, knows what the duties of the office are.''   ``You may have noticed, '' he added, ``that the consultingbusiness is not limited to people who have left the DefenseDepartment. People who have been in AID (the Agency forInternational Development) know a lot about foreign countries andhow to do business with them. Didn't Henry Kissinger form aconsulting firm and charge phenomenal fees?''   When he left the Pentagon, Flax said, ``there was an absoluteprohibition for one year on going back to the department I workedin with the Air Force and having to do with any matter thatinvolved contracts because I had held a position where I had someinfluence on virtually all contracts let in research anddevelopment.''   There was a lifetime ban, he said, on joining forces with anyonewith whom he had negotiated because some contracts stretch overmany years. As an example, Flax cited the Maverick missile, whichstill is in the Air Force arsenal.   Now, 20 years later, he said, conflict-of-interest laws are muchmore restrictive.   ``You have to be your own watchdog,'' Flax said. ``I'm verycareful about what I do. I'm no longer constrained. I've been outof government for a long, long time. Still, I watch my actions.''</TEXT></DOC>
