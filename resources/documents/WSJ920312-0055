U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry sentencedWilliam J. Spagnoli, a former vice president with CityFederal Savings Bank, to almost twice the maximum time of 51months suggested under federal sentencing guidelines andrequested by U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.</LP><TEXT>   Judge Barry said the harsh sentence was justified becauseMr. Spagnoli's &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;arrogance&quot; contributed to CityFederal's insolvency and the savings and loans crisis.   Gregory J. Wallance, a white-collar crime defense attorneywith Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler, said thesentence is &quot;atypical&quot; but &quot;permissible&quot; under theguidelines, which allow judges to consider aggravating ormitigating circumstances not contemplated by the FederalSentencing Commission when it drafted the guidelines.   The guidelines force judges to hand down sentences withina range provided on a mathematical grid, taking into accountsuch variables as the amount of money swindled in a fraud,whether weapons were used in a violent crime and the amountof drugs seized in a raid. Appeals courts have generallyfrowned on departures from the guidelines, which apply tocrimes committed after Nov. 1, 1987.   Mr. Chertoff said the ruling is a &quot;textbook-correctinterpretation of the law&quot; that he believes &quot;will stand up onappeal.   Justin Walder, Mr. Spagnoli's attorney, did not returnseveral phone calls.</TEXT></DOC>
