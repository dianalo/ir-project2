In a country where protests against dictatorship and theU.S. have become commonplace, the most significant aspect ofKorea's latest outburst of demonstrations is that they focusmore on economic rather than political grievances.</LP><TEXT>   As tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streetsacross the nation Wednesday to demand the dissolution of thenew ruling Democratic Liberal Party, their appeal was basedon bread-and-butter issues. Banners on the campus of YonseiUniversity, the center of anti-government student activity inSeoul, talked about rising inflation, rampant real-estatespeculation and housing shortages.   At the same time, swarms of young, middle-class officeworkers in suits joined thousands of students and dissidentsin downtown Seoul in taunting riot police and chantingslogans like: &quot;Save our livelihoods,&quot; &quot;Give us houses,&quot; and&quot;Down with dictators and tycoons.&quot;   &quot;People are furious,&quot; said a Korean political analyst whowatched the protests escalate. &quot;They see big businessmengetting richer and richer, and gobbling up all the realestate in the country, while the middle class can't afford tobuy houses and the poor can't even pay their rent.&quot;   Inflation, fueled mostly by housing costs, is running atan annual rate of about 14%, up from 6% last year. Thegovernment's Economic Planning Board reports that real-estatespeculation has doubled house prices in the past severalyears and is responsible for a 30% rise in land prices in1989 alone. That has pushed up average rents by 45% in thepast year.   In recent months, land speculation also has drained aboutfive trillion won ($7.17 billion) from banks and the stockmarket. That caused share prices to plummet in the first fourmonths of this year, bankrupting hundreds of small investorsand enriching large landholders -- especially insurance andsecurities companies owned by big business groups, which havespeculated heavily in real estate. On Thursday, Seoul shareprices plunged 2.7% in response to the political unrest.   Even the firebombing of the U.S. Information Service, orUSIS, office in the capital Wednesday, while chiefly aimed atforcing the withdrawal of 43,000 American troops stationed inKorea, had economic overtones. Radicals demanded that theU.S. stop pressuring Korea to open its agricultural markets,which they said would cripple Korean farmers.   President Roh Tae Woo acknowledged the publicdissatisfaction with his government and party on Monday,telling a nationwide television audience that neither has&quot;been able to gain public confidence in the consistency ofits policies.&quot;   As a result, Mr. Roh said, the nation is facing &quot;an arrayof political, economic and social difficulties,&quot; and he citedrampant land speculation, a highly volatile stock market,labor unrest, an export slump and rising crime. He promised acrackdown on real-estate speculation as his first priority,and on Tuesday the government announced measures to forcebusiness groups to sell off idle real estate.   Wednesday's demonstrations were the most violent sincemid-1987, when nationwide riots forced Mr. Roh's friend andpredecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, to abandon his military rule andpromise broad reforms. Mr. Roh was inaugurated to a five-yearterm in February 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
