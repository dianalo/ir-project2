But in running its own affairs, the second largest credit card company is trying to master some fundamental challenges.    After making strides to recover ground lost to arch-rival Visa International, MasterCard lately appears mired in a perpetual runner-up status. Last year, the not-for-profit organization controlled by about 150 big banks ran a $5.3 million deficit.    And merchants and processors are in near-revolt over a surprise increase in the fee that card-issuing banks charges merchants for each purchase made with a MasterCard.    MasterCard's directors, 26 executives from member banks world-wide, will meet tomorrow in Palm Springs, Calif., to consider steps to get MasterCard back on track.    In the most important of these decisions, the directors -- as early as tomorrow -- could name a successor to Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive officer for the past 8 1/2 years. Mr. Hogg announced his resignation July 14 in what industry executives say was a disagreement with the board over the heavy level of expenditures.    The board is also expected to trim its fee increase, set to take effect Jan. 1, to placate merchants and processors.    Board members declined to discuss the subject of Mr. Hogg's successor, but industry watchers say the heavy favorite is Alex W. &quot;Pete&quot; Hart, executive vice president for retail banking at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. and a MasterCard board member. Mr. Hart didn't return several phone calls seeking comment.    It was Mr. Hogg who turned MasterCard into a spirited competitor. Until the late 1970s, MasterCard held an edge over Visa and American Express Co. in charge volume. But in 1979 MasterCard slipped behind Visa as competitors devised better advertising campaigns and pioneered new technology.    Under Mr. Hogg, who formerly worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and American Express, MasterCard in 1983 introduced the concept of the premium credit card. Today, the Gold MasterCard is the leading premium credit card.    (Charge cards, such as the American Express green card, require the holder to pay the balance monthly. Credit cards allow consumers to pay balances over an extended period at annual interest rates as high as 19.5%.)    For all its innovations, which have helped MasterCard more than triple its annual volume since 1981, regaining the industry's top spot remains elusive. Visa has matched that pace, thereby widening the volume gap between it and MasterCard.    And MasterCard has a new competitor nipping at its heels -- the Optima card, American Express's new entry. Not even two years old, Optima has already vaulted into the ranks of the top 10 bank cards.    Currently, Visa and MasterCard have the advantage of being accepted by more merchants and of costing merchants less than Optima. But American Express is aggressively expanding its merchant base and encouraging holders of its green, gold and platinum cards to take Optima.    Mr. Hogg's abrupt resignation caught the industry by surprise. Credit card industry experts attribute it to Chairman Arthur B. Ziegler's desire for a leaner, more efficient operation. Mr. Ziegler, also a sector executive of Marine Midland Banks Inc., the New York unit of Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp., declined to discuss the matter.    Mr. Hogg is known for his grandiose style. Fond of gold cufflinks and custom-tailored shirts, he usually stays in the presidential suite of the finest hotels when traveling, bankers say. At his suggestion, MasterCard leased a one-bedroom apartment in New York's posh Trump Tower to entertain members and clients.    Those tastes were also reflected in some of Mr. Hogg's strategic moves. He championed industry-wide adoption of the &quot;smart card,&quot; which keeps an account's relevant data on a computer chip embedded in the card. But MasterCard's board -- and Visa's -- rejected the concept because of the costs involved. The move would have required a huge investment in new technology by processors and merchants.    In addition, MasterCard has drawn fire from some members for what they say are investments in technology that far exceed MasterCard's needs. The two most notable investments were last year's purchase of the Cirrus automated teller network for $34 million and an estimated $40 million spent since 1981 to develop the Banknet communications system.    Several MasterCard directors grew uneasy about such expenses, particularly when many of their own banks were cutting costs, bankers say. Credit cards remain banks' most profitable product, generating a 3% to 5% annual return at a time when banks are generally earning about 1% on assets. Consequently, the vitality of Visa and MasterCard is extremely important to banks.    &quot;There was this sense that MasterCard was being run lavishly without controls,&quot; says John Love, publisher of Bank Card News, a trade publication.    But Mr. Hogg's defenders reject that suggestion. &quot;If you're No. 2 and you want to be No. 1, do you spend like you're No. 2?&quot; asks one who requested anonymity. &quot;Russ was getting second-guessed by the board. The board was getting into a lot of day-to-day business.&quot; Mr. Hogg couldn't be reached for comment.    Even though the job is rumored to pay $500,000 a year, finding a successor hasn't been easy. Pressure is building to fill the spot quickly. &quot;We need to fill that spot soon or else we'll lose momentum,&quot; says a MasterCard official.    To spare a new president a major embarrassment, MasterCard's board tomorrow is expected to scale back increases of as much as 29% in the fees that merchants and processors pay banks for purchases made with MasterCards.    The increase in the so-called interchange rate, announced in September, was widely criticized by merchants and processors, who argue that it is excessive. Retailers such as Wal-Mart and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us have registered their displeasure about the rise, and Mr. Hogg hinted recently that MasterCard would trim its rate increase.    However, a retreat on the interchange fee could undercut MasterCard's efforts to overtake Visa. By raising the fee that bankers collect on purchases, MasterCard would provide card-issuing banks with a powerful incentive to put MasterCards rather than Visas in their customers' hands. If MasterCard's rate remains in line with Visa's, banks lose their incentive to prefer one card over the other.    An executive at one of the biggest card-issuing banks, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that view: &quot;The interchange fee is very important to us. If MasterCard remained committed to the higher fee, we definitely would issue more MasterCards.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
