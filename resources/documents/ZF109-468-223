Deskpro 386/20e.andO;The documents were printed on a Dataproducts Corp. LZR650 laser printerequipped with font cartridges compatible with Hewlett-Packard Co.'s B and Mcartridges.andM;The first document was 20 pages long, containing chapter headlings, sectionheadings and tables.andP;  The document was used in a timed test as it wastranslated from Word to WordPerfect to WordStar, and then back to Word.andM;Batch files were used in the timed tests, providing a wide range of resultsin the time required to complete three successive translations (see Specs,below).andP;  Mastersoft's Word for Word, with an elapsed time of 26 seconds, wasthe fastest, WordLink was the slowest at 108 seconds.andM;The second and third documents were short, single-page documents containingparagraphs with different format styles, tab settings, footnotes, headers andfooters.andP;  One file used all fonts available in the test printer; the otherused only the Courier font.andM;Software Bridge is the only program that successfully negotiated the fontchanges.andP;  To ensure accuracy, each Word font must be manually matched to theWordPerfect and WordStar fonts, a process that can be tedious.andP;  Only SoftwareBridge provides this matching capability.andM;In the single-font test-file translation, the Word for Word conversion toWordPerfect and the Software Bridge conversion to WordStar produced the idealresult: translated documents that, when printed, were indistinguishable fromthe originals.andM;On the whole, Software Bridge and Word for Word are clearly the two bestchoices.andP;  Both offer translation between a wide range of processors, performthe conversions very quickly and have customization features that allowtweaking the translation for specific features.andP;  WordPort and WordLink eachhave special strengths, but offer no price/performance advantage over theother products.andM;Reviews by David Claiborne; interviews by Erica Schroeder; edited by StevenWebsterandM;Keyword Moves from Unix, VAXandM;Keyword Office Technologies Ltd. will soon release its first software-onlyDOS-based program for word-processing translation, according to companyofficials.andM;With Keypak for MS/DOS, Keyword adds a DOS package to its line of VAX/VMS andUnix conversion systems.andM;Pc Week Labs examined a beta release of Keypak and found that it takes aslightly different approach to the conversion process.andM;Instead of having a main conversion engine and configuration files, it has aseparate program for each type of source word processor (&quot;SRCKW.EXE).andP;  Asecond program is necessary for each target word processor (&quot;TRGKW.EXE).andM;Both types of programs tend to be large, typically 100K bytes or more.andO;Loading a variety of translation packages on a hard disk requires at least200K bytes per supported word processor.andP;  Five different word processors willrequire more than 1 M byte of disk storage space.andM;This may not be a problem, since Keyword only supplies two user-specifiedsource/target combinations with its standard package.andP;  Other source andtarget programs are available at additional cost.andM;Installation of Keypak reflects its Unix/mainframe orientation.andP;  The defaultdirectory for program files is \ usr \ bin.andP;  The remainder of the files areput in \ usr \ lib \ kw.andP;  Installation, therefore, is straightforward.andM;Each system supplied by Keyword contains only the translation formats orderedby the user.andM;The evaluation copy, which contained conversion programs for ASCII, MicrosoftWord, WordPerfect and WordStar, came on four diskettes.andM;Keypak supports both menu and batch operations.andP;  The menu program, while notas simple as that of other programs, is easy to learn and follow, and alltest documents were converted without difficulty.andM;Custom configuration files can be developed for each available target orsource word processor.andP;  In addition, specific character-set configurationscan be developed to translate characters not supported in the target wordprocessor.andP;  The configuration files can be developed either with a lineeditor or via menu selections when using the Keypak user interface.andM;Because Keypak is derived from a mainframe product, it has special features.andO;One, ideal for network monitoring and auditing, is the generation of a logfile and statistics file that keep track of all program usage.andM;Keyword, located in Calgary, Alberta, can be reached at (403) 250-1770.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
