 I'll provide a list of the top-10innovations visible in my crystal ball.andP;  I anticipate that some readers mayargue with a few of my predictions.andP;  My list does not encompass all of thelikely changes (ones you believe missing may just be further down theimaginary list), nor do I guarantee that these 10 will occur.andP;  The computingfield is volatile enough that new trends could inhibit some of the predictedchanges or even make them obsolete.andP;  But for the near term (before 1995),I'll stick my neck out and wager that these changes will occur.andM;For each of the product changes I'll rationalize why the change is likely andif it has already begun.andP;  By &quot;innovations,&quot; I mean that these products aren'tyet widespread, (My use of the word &quot;innovation&quot; shouldn't be confused with&quot;unheard of.&quot;) Some vendors may either already incorporate some aspects ofthe change or have plans to do so.andM;I use &quot;innovation&quot; with respect to the mainstream expert-systems marketplace,and the top 10 items will eventually become common features of majorexpert-systems tools suppliers.andP;  Charts comparing competitor products willinclude these product features routinely, and we'll see vendors claimingtheir product carries more of a particular feature than their competitor's.andM;One more caveat: product innovations, such as the ability to access SQL froma shell, use of hypertext within a knowledge base, hooks into Lotus or dBASE,intermixing object-oriented paradigms with shells and similar features arealready firmly established.andP;  Not all major vendors have these features yet,but the view that robust shells should have these capabilities is undoubtedlyquite commonplace.andM;After I show you my list of top-10 likelies I'll mention my top-10 unlikelies(features that won't be found in most packages before the mid-1990s).andP;  Sohere's my list:andM;HOT LINKS WILL GET HOTandM;Near the end of 1989 the Lotus Development Co. and WordPerfect Corp. alliedto tie their best-selling products together via hot links.andP;  Similarly,Microsoft Corp. is working on a synergetic connection between Word and Excel.andO;Users want to be able to use the best parts of a product line seamlessly andnot be captive to just one product  at a time.andP;  Vendors think they canindividually supply all the functions that users want, but this goal isimprobable.andP;  Since establishing standards for products independentlydeveloped and then jointly shared is tough to do (gaining industry consensusis a long and risky process), vendors will make deals with each other tocreate hot links (seamless connections) between their respective products.andM;Expert-system shells will soon include hot links.andP;  Shells can already chainoff to a different package or allow the grabbing of someone else'sspreadsheet, but none of these approaches truly combines the separateproducts.andP;  Using an esoteric word-processing editor in a shell whiledeveloping a knowledge base can be painful, and outputting an ASCII file fromyour word processor and executing operating-system commands to get it into ashell is downright awkward.andP;  Hot links provide comfort for the shell user andreduce the amount of reinventing-the-wheel by shell vendors.andP;  They'llincrease the popularity of shells throughout the computer industry byreaching a new user population via their hot-link partner.andM;GROUPWAREandM;Using networks for group decision making became more popular in the late1980s.andP;  Groupware goes beyond electronic mail and promotes active andsometimes simultaneous use of distributed computing resources for decisionmaking.andP;  Shell vendors will have to recognize the importance of havingknowledge bases distributed across a network, allowing both group developmentof knowledge bases and group execution of multiple ones.andP;  Today a few shellsallow static copies of knowledge bases to be distributed or permit a centralserver with the whole knowledge base on it, but none let the developer anduser have multiple knowledge bases that fully interact in real time over adistributed network.andM;The networking portion of the computer industry is still grappling with manytechnical hurdles, but we'll see gradual, incremental improvement in shells,with networkers guiding the way.andM;KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITIONandM;Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck for most expert-system projects.andP;  Adefinite gap exists between knowledge acquisition and representationcapabilities in contemporary shells.andP;  Rather than shell languages forknowledge engineers to use, we'll see add-on products that generate thelanguage from some other fourth-generation language interactive system (suchas Extra and KAT).andP;  Shells already providing limited induction capabilitieswill be hard pressed either to improve their front-end features or promote asupplier with the appropriate tie-in package.andM;CASEandM;Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) will continue to grow in the1990s.andP;  As CASE tools improve we'll see more expert-systems developers usepowerful analysis-design-code generators instead of just simple shells(especially as knowledge bases get larger).andP;  Shell providers will forge hotlinks with CASE tools, incorporate CASE features into their own shells, andimprove CASE offerings via the embedding of expert systems.andM;NEURAL NETWORKSandM;Most neural-network products are stand-alones, and most expert-system shellsdon't provide neural-network capabilities.andP;  Sure enough, the subsymbolics(neural networks) will meet the symbolics (expert systems), though these twocommunities have been feuding until now.andP;  Where profits lie the two sideswill find common ground.andM;HYPERMEDIAandM;As CD-ROM reduces in price and increases in popularity and as video and othermedia get hooked on computers, expert-system shells will go beyond hypertextand enter the realm of hypermedia.andP;  Knowledge bases will encompass much morethan the mere text of facts and rules.andM;SHELL-TO-SHELLandM;Leftover knowledge bases from the 1980s will need to be reused or ported ontonew platforms.andP;  Knowledge engineers will be increasingly dissatisfied athaving to pick one vendor shell and use only the knowledge-base language ofthat particular shell (especially as they move from firm to firm and take ona greater variety of projects).andM;I predict that shells will allow the importation of another shell's knowledgebase and either run it directly or convert it into the native shell language.andM;EMBEDDED AND COMPACTandM;Expert-systems applications will be a small but significant part of larger,strategic systems.andP;  Even though machine horsepower will rise, users willstill demand that knowledge bases be run in as compact and embeddable a wayas possible.andP;  While many of the previous predictions emphasized the top-levelaspects of shells (front-end interactive capabilities), we can't neglect thelarge market for narrow cuts of an expert-system shell that are utilized inthe more conventional applications.andM;BUILT-IN VIRUS DETECTIONandM;The virus scares tend to be more myth than reality.andP;  Nonetheless, fear andconcern about viruses getting into a knowledge base on its way todistribution is strong.andP;  Without much additional effort the shell vendorswill add features that ensure the knowledge base is really clean.andM;GENETIC ALGORITHMSandM;Part of the excitement of the computer industry is the continual &quot;new-toy&quot;syndrome.andP;  Neural networks have already lost the newness glamour; users willclamor for something even newer-and along comes Darwin and geneticalgorithms.andP;  Whether they will be useful for AI developments is stillunknown, but I'll bet that some vendors will try to make it work.andO;Admittedly, this trend is near the bottom of my top 10, and if it isn'tgenetic algorithms it will be something equally mysterious (with a great dealof confusion and excitement surrounding it).andM;NOT-SO TOP 10andM;My top-10 list makes several assumptions about computer-industry trends butnot about remarkable technological breakthroughs.andP;  Some items I'd like topretend are in the top 10, but I just don't see them happening this soon.andO;So, my top 10 unlikely features are: (1) natural-language processing, (2)voice processing, (3) fuzzy logic, (4) parallel processing and concurrency,(5) pretailored shells or off-the-shelf knowledge bases, (6) standards forshells and knowledge bases, (7) full machine learning, (8) acceptedknowledge-engineering practices and methodologies, (9) all-platformcompatability a la SAA, and (10) renewed media attention and hype.andM;The good news is that my list of unlikelies includes items that still needmuch research and are waiting for someone to make a commercial breakthroughand strike a profit gold mine.andP;  The not-so-good news is the field is maturingand won't attract the computer-industry spotlight as it did; we're justregular members of the club now.andM;So there are my predictions.andP;  I'm probably conservative-I don't believe we'llsoon see cold fusion, people living happily on the moon, or that I'll win thestate lottery.andP;  Even if I'm wrong about any of the other predictions, I'dsettle for being wrong about the latter.andM;Lance B.
