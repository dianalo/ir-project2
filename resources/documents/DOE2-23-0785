Indium-111 leukocyte (In-WBC) imagingis both highly sensitive and effective in detecting and localizing abscessesin patients with renal failure. We report on a patient with APKD andsepsis in whom computed tomography, ultrasound, and physical examinationfailed to locate the renal abscess, which was found by In-WBC scanning.</TEXT></DOC>
