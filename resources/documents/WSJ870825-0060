Terms of the new agreement call for Affiliated to acquire First National Bank of Lovell, Wyo., for common and new cumulative preferred stock. The amount wasn't disclosed. In addition, the company will register with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell common stock to individuals, other investors and an employee stock ownership trust.    Altogether, the bank holding company said it will increase its common shares outstanding to about 2.2 million shares from 1.2 million shares.    It said the cumulative preferred stock will have to be approved by shareholders at a meeting to be scheduled. The two transactions, which are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1988, are contingent on the required regulatory approvals.    As previously reported, Affiliated originally planned to raise $11.7 million in new capital by purchasing for stock the Lovell bank, which has $44 million in assets, and by selling additional common stock to a group led by John C. Amman, the Lovell bank's chairman. The bank purchase and stock sale to the group would have resulted in a change in control of the company.    Under the revised terms, Affiliated said a single group or individual won't control more than 10% of the company's stock.    Affiliated had $432 million in assets June 30. It had a net loss of $1.8 million in the quarter ended June 30. </TEXT></DOC>
