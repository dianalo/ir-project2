Last month, a federal judge tossed out an SEC lawsuitagainst Amster andamp; Co., a company that speculates in takeoverstocks, ruling that disclosure rules don't apply until firmsteps are actually taken to pursue a takeover. Judge CharlesS. Haight in Manhattan said the SEC jumped the gun byapplying the rules to Amster's &quot;preliminary considerations&quot;of a proxy context for control of Graphic Scanning Corp.</LP><TEXT>   But the SEC, in asking Judge Haight to reconsider hisdecision, said early disclosure of preliminary takeover plansis necessary to protect investors.   &quot;Contingent plans or proposals can be highly significantto investors, as this case demonstrates,&quot; the SEC said in acourt filing. &quot;It can hardly be denied that a plan or even aproposal by a major shareholder to wage a proxy contest, withthe objectives at issue here, would be of great importance toinvestors deciding whether to buy, sell or hold Graphicsecurities.&quot;   The SEC maintains that Amster profited illegally bykeeping other investors in the dark about its possibletakeover plans until it had accumulated a block of stock&quot;from those ill-informed shareholders.&quot; Amster announced itsplan to seek control of Graphic on Feb. 28, 1986, but the SECalleges Amster was obligated to disclose its plans about amonth earlier, when the firm allegedly began solicitingsupport for a possible proxy fight.   &quot;All that is required is an accurate statement of thepresent state of affairs,&quot; the SEC said. &quot;Absent anydisclosure about the defendants' plans and proposals,investors were deprived of the protection the federalsecurities laws were intended to provide.&quot;   Peter C. Neger, an attorney for Amster with the firm Sheaandamp; Gould, said his client complied properly with SECrequirements, beginning with its first disclosure in August1985 that it owned a 5% stake in Graphic. He said that ifinvestors are required to disclose all tentative plans underconsideration, &quot;what you'll end up with is a glut of uselessdisclosures.&quot;   The SEC noted that other lower courts also have shied awayfrom requiring disclosure of tentative plans. But it saidthose decisions are inconsistent with a 1988 Supreme Courtruling, which the agency says clearly established thatcontingent plans may have to be disclosed to investors.   In the 1988 case, Basic Inc. vs. Levinson, the SupremeCourt rejected the argument that only firm plans for a mergerhad to be disclosed. That case, however, didn't deal with thespecific disclosure rules at issue in the Amster lawsuit.   In its court filing, the SEC noted that it wasn't trying&quot;to suggest that every consideration or thought given to {atakeover} plan must be disclosed; at an early enough stage,possible plans or proposals may simply be too ephemeral torequire disclosure.&quot;   ---   KUWAIT GOES SHOPPING for law firm to handle claims againstIraq.   The Kuwaiti government has been inundated with pitchesfrom U.S., British and French law firms, according to lawyersfamiliar with the search. Most, but not all, of the proposalsare unsolicited, these lawyers say.   The government is believed to be talking seriously to onlya few law firms, including New York-based Cleary, Gottlieb,Steen andamp; Hamilton and Shearman andamp; Sterling, according topartners at the two law firms. The Kuwaitis are also talkingwith a consortium of British law firms, accounting firms andother advisers put together by Jeremy P. Carver, a partner atthe London law firm Clifford Chance. The consortium includesaccounting firms KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst andamp; Young and PriceWaterhouse and the London law firm Stephenson Harwood, Mr.Carver said.   A spokesman at the Kuwait United Nations mission in NewYork said he was unfamiliar with the status of hisgovernment's search for a law firm.   Two lawyers familiar with the claims process that emergedafter the Iran hostage crisis said the Kuwaiti representationwould likely generate more than $10 million in legal fees,although the precise amount is impossible to predict.   The two U.S. and two British law firms that say they arenegotiating with Kuwait have represented the government inthe past. Cleary, Gottlieb has represented Kuwait on itsinvestment activities and on asset-freeze issues, accordingto partner Ned B. Stiles. Shearman andamp; Sterling has advisedKuwait on real estate development matters, partner Joseph T.McLaughlin said.   &quot;I suspect it's very difficult for them to distinguishamong many law firms because this is a disaster withoutprecedent for them,&quot; said a lawyer whose firm submitted aproposal. &quot;How they'll make their choice, frankly, is notclear to me.&quot;   Mr. Carver, of Clifford Chance, said he believes Kuwaitwill choose its lawyers by the end of the month. In late May,the government announced it would appoint an independentauthority to handle the claims, which eventually will beadjudicated by a not-yet-appointed U.N. CompensationCommission.   ---   LAWYERS MUST IDENTIFY clients who pay large cash fees,court rules.   The federal appeals court in Manhattan rejected the claimsof the criminal-defense bar that the disclosure requirementis unconstitutional and violates attorney-client privilege.The court, in affirming a district judge's ruling, said theJustice Department's reasons for requiring disclosureoutweigh concerns about attorney-client privilege.   Under the tax law, anyone who is paid more than $10,000 incash for one or more related transactions must identify forthe IRS the person who paid the money. The main purpose ofthe law is to help track down money launderers and taxevaders.   The appeals-court panel said, &quot;The importance of clientidentification as a means of uncovering tax evasion isapparent&quot; from the criminal-defense bar's own claim that itwould affect thousands of attorneys each year.   To avoid being identifed to the IRS by their attorneys,clients &quot;need only pay counsel in some manner other thancash. The choice is theirs,&quot; the appeals court said. &quot;None ofthe appellants have advanced a legitimate reason why paymentother than cash cannot be made.&quot;   Attorneys at Fischetti andamp; Russo and Goldberger andamp; Dubin, thefirms that refused to comply with the tax law in this case,couldn't be reached for comment.   Neal Sonnett, a defense attorney in Miami and formerpresident of the National Association of Criminal DefenseLawyers, said the tax law &quot;forces lawyers into the untenableposition of either not complying with the law or violatingtheir ethical obligations.&quot;   Mr. Sonnett said many attorneys in such cases will go tocourt rather than voluntarily turn over client informationthat they believe should be kept confidential.   ---   COMPUTER HACKER seeks U.S. Supreme Court review of hisconviction.   Robert T. Morris Jr., the former graduate student whose&quot;virus&quot; program three years ago disrupted a nationwidecomputer network, asked the high court to reconsider hisfelony conviction under a federal computer crime law.   The prosecution of Mr. Morris, 25 years old, has beenclosely watched by law enforcement officials and the computerindustry. Mr. Morris was the first person convicted under asection of a 1986 statute that punishes &quot;anyone whointentionally accesses&quot; federal computers withoutauthorization and &quot;causes loss&quot; valued at $1,000 or more.   Mr. Morris's petition for Supreme Court review turns onthe statute's requirement of proof of intent to cause damage.He claims that the law requires such proof, not merely intentto gain access to computers without authorization. Thatargument was unsuccessful in March in the Second U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals.   &quot;It's undisputed that Morris didn't intend to do what hedid, which was to shut people's computers down. We're arguingthat you can't really have this crime without intending tocause harm,&quot; said Mr. Morris's lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, apartner at the Washington law firm of Bonner andamp; O'Connell.   A spokesman for the Department of Justice said thatprosecutors were still studying the review petition andcouldn't comment on it.   In his 1989 trial, Mr. Morris testified that he gainedaccess to an electronic mail system used by academic,corporate and government researchers, and sent out a programthat he believed to be harmless. Instead, the so-called&quot;virus&quot; multiplied out of control and disrupted operations atmilitary centers and elsewhere.   He was found guilty by a federal court jury in Syracuse,N.Y., fined $10,000, placed on three years' probation andordered to perform 400 hours of community service.</TEXT></DOC>
