They have even enlisted the aid of a Chinese sea goddess.   Taiwan and Fujian are separated by 100 miles of water in theFormosa Strait and 40 years of hostility between the Communistmainland and Nationalist Taiwan.   Some businessmen have come to Fujian, nevertheless, even at therisk of prosecution at home.   Deputy Gov. You Dexin told visiting foreign reporters that 50Taiwan firms have defied their government's ban on trade contactswith the mainland to invest about $50 million in the province.   The actual number may be much higher. Most Taiwanese avoidtrouble at home by contracting under the names of Hong Kong agentsor relatives on the mainland.   Taiwan-Fujian trade, which totalled $40 million last year,reached $20 million in the first four months of 1988, You said.Most goes through middlemen in Hong Kong, although more than 10percent is done out on the Taiwan Strait. Overall, indirect tradebetween Taiwan and the entire Chinese mainland was an estimated$1.5 billion last year.   Fujian officials said among the ideas for bringing in moreTaiwan money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economiczones for Taiwan investors.   One is Meizhou, home of the 10th century legendary figure Mazuwho is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress forseafarers. For businessmen braving the still stormy waters of thestrait, Mazu could provide welcome shelter.   Taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since theNationalists lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949 and fled tothe island.   China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, encouragesdirect trade and communications links as a first step towardreunification. In the past, Taiwan adamantly refused all contactswith the mainland, but it began in October to allow people to visitrelatives in China.   In the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted,65,000 Taiwanese came to China, many to Fujian, where about 80percent of Taiwan's 19.6 million people have their roots.   Fujian officials say it is inevitable that Taiwan, with itscurrency appreciating against the U.S. dollar and its wage costsrising, will move factories to China, where labor is much cheaperand where language and customs are the same .   ``They can make money here,'' said Chen He, magistrate of atownship in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, which is building a$2.4-million sports equipment factory with a Taiwanese businessman.``This is their homeland and they love it.''   During a recent press tour of the province, people frequentlytalked of contacts with Taiwan enterprises.   Hong Ziwei, a 29-year-old toy manufacturer in Shishi, said hewould meet a Taiwan businessman in August to discuss a jointventure to export toys. The Taiwanese man, he said, had written aletter to a local relative asking for help in finding a mainlandpartner.   In Quanzhou, Mayor Chen Rongchun said sweet potatoes, a favoriteamong millions of Taiwanese with roots in Fujian, could be a bigseller on Taiwan.   ``Taiwan compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotionfor goods coming from this place,'' he said.   Much of the Taiwanese investment goes to Xiamen, a southernFujian port that is one of the nation's four designated specialeconomic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment.   Xiamen's authorities said 39 projects with anticipated Taiwaneseinvestment worth $42 million have been approved in such fields asjewelry, shoes, bicycle parts and aluminum window frames.   While emphasizing that Taiwan is part of China, mainlandofficials say Taiwanese are given the same preferential treatmentas foreign investors, or better. In Xiamen, for example,Taiwanese-funded joint ventures receive a four-year tax holiday,rather than the three years given foreign enterprises.   Two Taiwanese business executives in May were given five-yearprison terms by a Taipei court for business dealings on themainland. Because of that Fujian officials promise to keep secretthe details of all Taiwanese transactions.   ``The first question we take into consideration is theirpersonal security,'' Deputy Gov. You said. ``We take measures tokeep their names secret.''</TEXT></DOC>
