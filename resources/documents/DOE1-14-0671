The purposes of the tertiaryresearch is as follows: to make the comprehensive survey of knowledgeon the geothermal resource research obtained so far; to comprehensivelyestablish the exploration technique systematically extracting the promisinggeothermal resource areas; especially to establish the dynamically seizingtechnique of geothermal resource by the clarified research and developmentprogram focusing on the fluid flow model; and to establish the applicationtechnique of extensively accumulated information on the resource andthe expert system utilizing artificial intelligence for the rapid comprehensiveanalysis and objective analysis based on scientific procedure. It isnecessary, therefore{le} to immediately begin the research and appropriatelyselect the number of areas to be surveyed for promoting the continuityof research and rational development of domestic resources.</TEXT></DOC>
