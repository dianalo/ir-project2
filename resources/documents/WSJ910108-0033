In the continuing race to boost the speed and capacity offiberoptic communications systems, researchers reduced anintricate apparatus of &quot;colliding-pulse mode-locked&quot; (CPM)lasers and fibers spread over a four-foot-by-six-foot labtable to an indiumphosphide chip measuring two squaremillimeters. Then, Bell Labs says, it used the device totransmit 350 billion light pulses a second, each shorter thana trillionth of a second, through 24 kilometers of glassfiber. By contrast, the fastest commercial systems generate2.5 billion pulses.   Unlike conventional, single-pulse generating lasers, a CPMlaser generates multiple pulses that collide within thedevice's &quot;quantum well,&quot; the thin cavity that exists betweenthe sandwich of crystals that make up the device. Even withno electrical stimulation, these overlapping pulses naturallysynchronize and shorten, increasing the laser's capacity tohandle phone and data traffic.   Though ATandamp;T doesn't expect to market a product with thenew device before the end of the decade, experts say thebreakthrough by Bell Labs, Murray Hill, N.J., together withprevious advances in high-capacity cable technology, shouldspur development of systems that can deliver studio-qualitydigital television signals to the home or office via phonelines.                                                                                                          Radio System Bounces   Data off Meteor Trails                                                                                                          BROADCOM, a tiny New Jersey company, is commercializingstardust.   The military and some companies have been bouncing radiosignals off meteor trails since the 1950s. But the technique,which is inexpensive compared with satellite systems, cansend data only at very low speeds.   Now Broadcom, an Randamp;D house in Mahwah, says it can turn thetwo billion or so meteors that streak into the Earth'satmosphere every day into high-powered transmission networks.   Current meteor-transmission systems use radio waves tobounce signals off the microscopic dust from a meteor trailto another antenna far away. But sometimes it takes severalminutes to find a meteor to carry the traffic. And oncefound, the trail lasts as little as four seconds.   Broadcom has just received a patent on a system that usesa series of antennas, low-power radio transceivers and customsoftware to scan the sky and focus on a meteor like a camera,capturing its trail to transmit data.   From its earth stations, one in Mahwah and the other inWaterbury, Vt., Broadcom has been able to performtransmissions every 30 seconds, according to President JohnChironna. &quot;We expect to get that down to every four seconds,which would give us much faster transmission speeds.&quot;   Mr. Chironna says that he's talking to Indonesia aboutusing a Broadcom system for long-distance data transmission,and that Conrail is considering using Broadcom to monitor itsthousands of rail cars during transit.                                                                                                          Turning Cable Networks   Into Phone Systems                                                                                                          THIS system could someday make phone companies think twiceabout encroaching on cable-TV operators' turf.   First Pacific Networks, a seven-year-old start-uporiginally backed by Southwestern Bell Corp. and now drawingHong Kong funding, is selling a cheap digital system that canquickly turn a cable or data network into a powerful phonesystem.   First Pacific's system uses a small $500 electronic boxinstalled in the home to set up and receive calls on a cablenetwork from other phones. When a caller in the home dials anumber, the special unit finds an empty channel on the cablesystem and &quot;broadcasts&quot; the dialed number to other phones onthe network. The correct extension then receives the call,says Robert McNamara, executive vice president ofengineering. Another box, called a trunk interface unit, isinstalled in the network to link the traffic to the publicphone network.   For now, corporations and public entities, including thecity of Palo Alto, Calif., are using the system. But FirstPacific, Sunnyvale, Calif., which has so far sold 25 systems,is also pushing its product to overseas cable companies inAustralia, Britain and Hong Kong that are allowed to providephone service. And Mr. McNamara says the company has drawninterest from several North American cable operators.                                                                                                          Faxophiles Can Go Away   Without Losing Touch                                                                                                          PEOPLE who can't stand to be away from their fax machinesmay get some comfort from a new toy.   Code-A-Phone has devised an inexpensive system that turnsa low-end home or office facsimile machine into ahigh-powered answering system from which faxes can beretrieved while a user is away and even forwarded to anotherfax machine.   Code-A-Phone, a unit of Thailand's Technology ApplicationsLtd., is aiming its $499 electronic box, called the 7700Personal Fax Answering System, at cost-conscious home andsmall-business customers. By contrast, fax systems on themarket today that offer bells and whistles such asanswering-machine capability can run more than $1,000.   &quot;The product makes sense, but so far the home equipmentmarket is very small,&quot; says David Atlas, senior analyst atInternational Data Corp.   The unit allows a customer using a hotel fax machine, forexample, to retrieve as much as 30 pages of digitally storedfax from a distant machine and to forward it by entering anaccess code and a series of commands.</TEXT></DOC>
