For now, business continues as usual at most of the clinics andhospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out ofevery 100 American women of childbearing age. Under the new ruling,more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption,because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than thepoint at which the states may now intercede.   But with three more challenges to Roe on the justices' docket,it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973decision entirely, allowing states either to re-criminalize allabortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions, rangingfrom mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medicaltesting of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother.   Blackmun himself wrote that the signs his decision will beexplicitly overturned ``are evident and very ominous, and a chillwind blows.''   Some saw the Missouri ruling as the grandest judicialaffirmation to date of Ronald Reagan's revolution. Others say itmay prove, ironically, to unravel it. The opinion of the court'smajority simply is not shared by the majority of Americans.   Most polls, including a Media General-Associated Press surveylast summer, say that by a 2-1 margin, Americans believe abortionsshould be legal. But they are more evenly divided, and in somecases tilt the other way, on questions regarding public spending,parental consent and related curbs.   Charlotte Taft, director of a women's clinic in Dallas, puts itthis way: ``Americans favor abortion only in the case of rape,incest and their own personal circumstance.''   Democratic pollster Peter Hart says many Republicans outside thereligious right _ those in the suburban mainstream of the party _``have always given a wink and a nod'' to their candidates' statedabortion views. But now that the court has made abortion a hotpolitical issue, he says, ``many will not find that acceptableanymore.''   William Schneider of the conservative American EnterpriseInstitute echoed that view when he warned GOP politicians thatsuburban defections ``could drive a stake through the heart of theReagan coalition.''   Republican consultant Roger Stone, however, says the DemocraticParty, which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platformlast year, stands to lose its last conservative bloc, the urban,blue-collar Roman Catholics.   There are no guarantees to any of these theories. Even theCatholic coalition cannot be taken for granted, despite thechurch's vehement opposition to abortion. Indeed, Guttmacherresearchers have found that Catholic women are more likely to havean abortion than either Protestant or Jewish women _ probablybecause they practice less birth control. Another somewhatstartling finding: One out of every six women who have an abortiondescribes herself as an evangelical Christian.   There will be some early clues on the political scene. Abortionis an issue in two gubernatorial races next month, in New Jerseyand Virginia, as well as the mayoral contest in New York City. Andnext year, 36 gubernatorial races as well as the U.S. House and athird of the Senate will be fought.   The pro-choice movement, meanwhile, is back on the march _starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300,000 people tothe capital on the eve of the Supreme Court's hearing of theMissouri case. And it was buoyed last month by the FloridaLegislature's wholesale rebuke of the anti-abortion laws Gov. BobMartinez tried to push through a special session. Moreover, for thefirst time this decade, the House and Senate passed a bill thatwould have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance forabortions. Bush vetoed it this past week.   ``Read our lips: Take our rights, lose your jobs,'' says KateMichelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.At its 20th anniversary convention, the league named ninepoliticians, including Martinez and Sen. Jesse Helms of NorthCarolina, as special targets for defeat next year.   According to Larry Sabato, political scientist at the Universityof Virginia, abortion is likely to become ``The Beirut of Americanpolitics _ a no-win issue.'' California pollster Mervin Field saysthe nation's 7,500 state legislators are ``saying `Oh, my God,' andwondering how they can control the damage.''   The anit-abortion movement, meanwhile, is content to take thingsone step at a time. ``We believe the court will permit the statesand Congress to restrict the reasons for abortions,'' says DouglasJohnson of the National Right to Life Committee.   Overall, more than half the states are regarded as likely toenact some restrictions, another eight to 10 are battlegrounds, and10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortion-on-demand rights.   Part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such ablizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics anddoctors will give up their abortion services as legally orfinancially risky. The anti-abortion shock troops, meanwhile,belong to ``Operation Rescue,'' a largely white, evangelicalChristian group that counts 35,000 members and thousands of arrestswhile demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country.   Typically, its ``rescues'' entail forming a human blockadearound the clinic, while ``sidewalk counselors'' attempt to turnaway the women trying to get through. Some protestors have enteredclinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood.   The group, disowned by many in the anti-abortion movement, isled by young Randall Terry, who carts a disfigured, splotchy fetushe calls ``Baby Choice'' around the country in a jar offormaldehyde. At news conferences, he lays the fetus out in a tinycoffin lined with white satin. Terry, a former used-car salesman,will point to the fetus and declare: ``That's not a blob of cells.That's a little girl.''   Operation Rescue also distributes a video designed to evokeequal shock. It features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenesof Nazi concentration camps. A somewhat milder video, called ``theSilent Scream,'' has been circulated for years by otheranti-abortion groups.   Now, the pro-choice forces are distributing a video of theirown. Produced by the Fund for the Feminist Majority, it is called``Abortion: For Survival'' and depicts an actual abortion thatlasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos, amounting to abouttwo tablespoons of blood and tissue. The point is to demonstratethat what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearlythe baby-like figure depicted by the opposition.   Whatever the tactics, the abortion war looms, like the civilrights struggle and Vietnam, as a long and painful one for thecountry. The difference is that nobody predicts an end to thisfight, by law or by conscience.</TEXT></DOC>
