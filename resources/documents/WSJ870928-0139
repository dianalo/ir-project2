Paul Freedenberg, assistant secretary of commerce for trade administration, said this scrutiny will consist mainly of a Pentagon review of export license applications. Such review was in effect until June, when the Commerce Department began waiving the requirement.    A Pentagon review could mean months of delays for U.S. companies that want to ship products to any of about one hundred companies in this category, which are situated in allied and non-allied countries. The sensitive goods involve high-technology products with the potential for military use.    Mr. Freedenberg clarified the department's policy after Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.) denounced the agency for its &quot;cavalier approach&quot; to such exports. The senator charged that the department during the waiver period approved a license for the shipment of a &quot;powerful computer system&quot; to a Hamburg, West Germany-based shipping company that is 51% Soviet-owned.    The Commerce Department identified the license applicant as International Business Machines Corp. but said the product was never shipped. &quot;The irony of it all is that IBM lost the sale to a Japanese vendor because of long delays in reviewing the license,&quot; a Commerce Department aide said.    An IBM spokesman confirmed that the company was the license applicant but insisted that it had &quot;complied with all Commerce Department regulations.&quot; The company said it intended to replace an IBM 4381 system already installed in the Hamburg company with an upgraded model that has greater memory.    There is no evidence that the Hamburg company, Transnautic Shipping Co., used the old IBM for any purpose other than the authorized one of keeping track of container shipments bound for the Soviet Union, industry sources said.    The Commerce Department had discarded the Pentagon review process because of U.S. industry complaints and protests from allied governments with jurisdiction over such companies. For instance, West Germany, which treats Transnautic no differently than it does West German-owned companies in that country, charged that U.S. attempts to hold up shipments to such concerns was discriminatory and an &quot;extraterritorial&quot; application of U.S. law.    Trading sources said that before the Commerce Department waived the review requirement, the West German anti-cartel authority was poised to take action against IBM's West German subsidiary for refusing to honor orders from another West German company. It isn't known if any other U.S. company has obtained a license through the waiver.    Sen. Shelby's aides said he intends to defend on the Senate floor the Pentagon's right to review licenses for exports to non-socialist countries. The Export Administration Act gives the Pentagon authority to review only exports to Communist countries, but the agency has exercised the additional responsibility through a presidential directive that has come under increasing attack from the House. </TEXT></DOC>
