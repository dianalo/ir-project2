Prices also climbed in London, Frankfurt and most smaller markets, boosted by the belief George Bush would win the U.S. presidency.    Tokyo traders said investors continue to worry about the implications for tax reform of the Recruit Cosmos scandal and about Emperor Hirohito's frail health.    The Nikkei index closed at 28007.27, up 140.91 points. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section was up 16.29 points to close at 2145.73. First section volume was estimated at 900 million shares, compared with a revised 866.7 million shares Monday.    In Tokyo on Wednesday, the Nikkei index surged 154.98 points to close the morning session at 28162.25 in moderate trading.    The U.S. presidential election may have kept some on the sidelines Tuesday, though most participants insisted that Japanese investors were counting on Republican candidate Bush to win and weren't bothered by recent polls showing his lead narrowing.    Some traders said that the election may have, on the contrary, helped the market by sparking speculative buying of one of the leading sectors Tuesday -- electricals. Electricals may have been higher on &quot;some speculation that when Bush wins the election there may be a bit of temporary strength in the dollar,&quot; said one trader.    Sony rose 230 yen to 5,960 yen ($48), while TDK was up 160 to 3,890, and Toshiba gained 33 to 996. The major electricals still depend on exports for a large share of sales and are sensitive to the yen's movements.    All eyes have turned to the Recruit Cosmos scandal again after news over the weekend that a former secretary to the chairman of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone admitted to buying shares of the company before they became available to the public. The secretary denied he bought the shares last week.    Traders say the Recruit Cosmos scandal deters investors because it threatens to delay passage of the ruling party's tax reform bill.    London shares ended sharply higher as the market judged victory by Vice President Bush a virtual certainty. A healthy start to Wall Street and a firmer dollar also helped sentiment, dealers said.    Over the past several sessions, shares were hit by jitters on the perception that Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was narrowing the gap on Mr. Bush. But, with voting under way, market-watchers decided to bank on a Bush victory.    &quot;Suddenly, there seems to be a bit more confidence seeping into the market and with another Republican in the White House, buying is back in style,&quot; one market-maker said.    The Financial Times 100-share index finished 20.9 points higher at 1840.6. The 30-share index was up 16.0 points at 1491.0. Volume was relatively good by recent standards, with 502.8 million shares changing hands, compared with 334.5 million Monday.    &quot;People seem to have come to the conclusion that if Bush wins, we'll see some sort of rally, so we're all a bit loath to get caught short,&quot; another market-maker said.    Dollar-earning international issues were boosted by a strong showing in the U.S. currency. Among internationals, Imperial Chemical Industries rose 9 pence to #10.24 ($18.20), while Glaxo Holdings gained 10 to #10.88.    Lonrho reversed its recent upward trend, shedding 6 to 416 pence in profit-taking. Players became uncertain as to whether Bond Corp. Holdings might launch a takeover bid for the U.K. conglomerate.    Television broadcaster and consumer electronics concern Granada Group surged 14.5 to 341. Traders said the shares were benefiting from Monday's release of a U.K. government paper that outlined changes to the structure of television in the U.K. In addition, dealers said the shares were upgraded by several brokers.    Frankfurt share prices closed sharply higher on news that the way has been cleared for Daimler-Benz to take control of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, brokers said. The DAX index jumped 16.75 points to 1287.88.    Brokers said investors were cheered by news of a preliminary accord by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet Monday that will allow automotive giant Daimler-Benz to take an initial 30% stake in MBB, which will create Europe's second biggest aerospace group and cement Daimler-Benz's position as West Germany's biggest industrial group.    &quot;The news caused Daimler shares to surge, and that pulled the rest of the market with it,&quot; said a broker.    At the close, Daimler-Benz was up 16 marks to 760.5 marks ($428), and other auto shares also gained.    Another factor was sentiment that the U.S. election Tuesday will put Vice President Bush in the White House. The candidate was favored by Europe's financial community, brokers said.    Finally, demand was boosted by expectations that strong capital goods sales will help earnings of the machinery-making divisions of the country's big steelmakers, which may, in turn, boost their dividends this year, brokers said.    In the steel sector, Mannesmann was up 5.8 to 186.5, while Thyssen gained 4.4 to 175, and Hoesch put on 2 to 166.5.    Helped by Daimler-Benz, shares of Volkswagen surged 9.4 to 313.5, while Bayerische Motoren Werke was up 7 to 535.8.    Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan.    Prices closed higher in Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong and Sydney and were mixed in Manila and Wellington. The Singapore market was closed.
