The state-owned Somisa plant, where losses soared to $1million a day, dismissed 7,000 of its 12,000 workers lastyear and shut down one of its two blast furnaces.</LP><TEXT>   Metalworkers Union members reacted in ways that used tobring relief. They held rallies, sit-ins and hunger strikes;lobbied sympathetic congressmen; appealed to the public; metwith Cabinet ministers, and asked the Roman Catholic Churchto mediate.   None of it helped. President Carlos Menem's governmentwouldn't rescind the layoffs or reopen the second furnace. Itwants to sell the complex in San Nicolas, a river port 125miles north of Buenos Aires, by the end of this year.   Unions are in disarray because of Mr. Menem's successes,his public support and his refusal to meet their demands.   &quot;The union movement is even weaker today&quot; than under themilitary governments of 1976-83, &quot;which banned or co-optedit,&quot; said Senen Gonzalez, a labor analyst. &quot;Unions used tosymbolize resistance. Now, they are so afraid of losingjobs.&quot;   Since the 1940s, only the military has outranked labor asa political force in this country of 33 million people.Unions put governments in power and threw them out. They werethe core of support for state control of the economy.   Labor backed Mr. Menem for president, but real wages havetrailed inflation since his election in 1989. He abolishedtens of thousands of public jobs and rewrote labor laws tofavor business. He has tried to stabilize the economy byhalting inflation and revitalize it by reducing the state'srole.   &quot;Menem has destroyed the power of unions, and that is mostimportant&quot; to the success of his economic plan, said JuanAlemann, an economist and former Treasury secretary.   The General Labor Confederation conducted 13 generalstrikes against Mr. Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin. Itsrepresentatives in Congress blocked Mr. Alfonsin's efforts tosell the state airline and telephone company, reduce thepublic payroll and cut government subsidies.   Mr. Menem bypassed Congress, using a presidential decreeto end subsidies that cost hundreds of millions of dollars ayear. He dropped more than 100,000 public jobs, ignoringunion protests.   His Peronist party government sold the phone company inNovember 1990 and the national airline, AerolineasArgentinas, two weeks later.   Controls on wages, prices, interest rates and foreignexchange were lifted, again by presidential decrees. Mr.Menem lowered tariffs and reduced the state role in theeconomy. The state oil company YPF, Argentina's biggestindustrial concern, will be sold next year.   It appears to be working. The economy grew in 1991 for thefirst time since 1987 and 6% growth is projected for thisyear. Unemployment is down to 6.5% of the work force, thebudget is nearly in balance and the currency is stable.</TEXT></DOC>
