There, in makeshift classrooms ripe with the sounds and smellsof ferrets, falcons, porcupines and snakes, 30,000 New York Cityelementary schoolchildren a year get a few hours to experiencescience the way scientists do: by touching, observing andexperimenting.   Instead of reading about it in some lifeless textbook, secondgraders from P.S. 205 actually saw a ferret demonstrate its naturaldefense: spinal flexibility that enables it to turn its long,slender body completely around in a narrow plastic tube and facepotential danger.   ``First we learned how the animals moved. Then we learned abouttheir colors,'' said Gary Beckles, a first-grader at P.S. 205. ``Wesaw a owl and a fire-bellied toad and we even touched a boaconstrictor.''   Visitors from P.S. 29, another elementary school in the Bronx,felt the slimy back of a bullfrog for the first time in their lives_ after some coaxing from zoo instructor Nikki Schulak _ andlearned about natural camouflage by studying the black and orangehide of a salamander.   The classes, conducted by the Bronx Zoo, are among 13 localscience education programs cited as exemplary in a new U.S.Department of Education publication, ``Science Education ProgramsThat Work.'' For about $300 to $400 per class, the program offersscience training and materials for teachers, and three to six classvisits to the zoo for students in grades Kindergarten through 6.   But the program is a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismallandscape of elementary school science around the country.   Critics from U.S. Education Secretary William J. Bennett on downsay science as taught in many U.S. elementary schools manages toreplace children's innate fascination with nature's wonders withmind-deadening facts and predictable textbook exercisesmasquerading as ``experiments.''   Experts cite several problems: elementary teacher training thatoften bypasses or plays down science, school systems that stressreading and math scores and consider science a frill by comparison,failure by schools to make use of resources like planetariums andzoos, and overreliance on textbooks that rarely offer genuineexperimentation or grounding in scientific method.   The sorry state of elementary science instruction is the oftenoverlooked reason that U.S. students do so poorly in science lateron in school compared with students in other industrializedcountries.   U.S. elementary and high school students, especially girls, knowless about science than their counterparts did in 1970, accordingto a study released this year by the International Association forthe Evaluation of Educational Achievement of how students in 24nations perform in science.   For example, more than eight out of 10 U.S. 5th graders in 1970correctly answered a multiple choice question on how long it takesto travel to the moon. In 1986, only 47 percent of the 5th graderschose the correct answer: ``A few days.''   In an otherwise laudatory report on elementary education in1986, Bennett singled out science instruction as a weak spot.   The report, ``First Lessons,'' said the average fourth grader islucky to get 30 minutes a day of science instruction. And rarelydoes it include a taste of genuine lab work or experimentation.   ``We need a revolution in elementary school science,'' said theBennett report. ``There is probably no other subject whose teachingis so at odds with its true nature.   ``We have come to think of science as a grab-bag of esotericfacts and stunts _ the periodic table, the innards of frogs, theway to make little hot plates out of tin cans and wires.''   Across the street from the Bronx Zoo, at P.S. 205, teachers andadministrators have struggled to include more science in thecurriculum, especially ``hands-on'' lessons featuringexperimentation and visual demonstrations.   The elementary school's teachers, bored with the standardscience curriculum handed down by the central school board, gottogether about three years ago and devised their own enrichedcurriculum which pooled their knowledge and downplayed the role ofstandard textbooks.   ``I remember that we were scared about science as teachers. Wewere not science mavens,'' said Rosanne Turits, head earlychildhood teacher at P.S. 205.   But the school has no lab, and science coordinator MaryanneDelgado must make do with a budget of just $250 for equipment likethermometers and magnifying glasses. As a result, ``hands-on''science sometimes means a few minutes at the end of a lessonlooking at light through a prism. Or the old perennial: growinglima bean plants.   According to a little-publicized report funded by the NationalScience Foundation last November:   _the nation's Kindergarten-through-third graders spend anaverage of 19 minutes per day on science, increasing to 38 minutesin grades 4-6;   _69 percent of Kindergarten-through-third grade teachers rely ontextbooks, rising to 89 percent by grades 4-6.   _three-quarters of Kindergarten-through-third grade classes getscience lectures, 87 percent have discussions, but only half usehands-on materials or participate in lab work. Yet two-thirds ofscience teachers ``agree'' or ``strongly agree'' that lab classesare more effective.   _while 87 percent of elementary teachers took ``methods''courses in teaching elementary science, only three out of 10 tookcollege level chemistry, 17 percent took physics, 58 percent tookbiology.   And in a recent critique of nine commonly used elementaryscience texts, David L. Elliott and Kathleen Carter Nagel,co-directors of Educational Materials Associates, private textbookconsultants in Berkeley, Calif., concluded that science programsrelying on such texts ``teach students to think of science mainlyas a collection of conclusions to be memorized.''   Such texts, the critique said, hardly mention, much lessexplain, ``the fundamental canons and methods of scientificinquiry, the attitude of objectivity, or the sometimes tediouspursuit of all leads _ inevitably including dead ends _ inscientific investigations.''   Real experimentation lays open many possible alternatives andanswers.   But typically, such texts offer recipes in place of genuine labactivity. They lay out the goal, state the materials needed, giveinstructions, and then provide the ``correct answer,'' _ what'ssupposed to happen.   ``School science,'' the Elliott and Nagel concluded, ``is toooften simply the pursuit of the known.''</TEXT></DOC>
