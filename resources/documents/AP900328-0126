She said her country has no national pesticide policy.   ``Instead, policies change frequently, according to changes ingovernment and the influence of financially interested groups,''she told the panel, which is considering a bill to stop U.S.companies from exporting chemicals not registered for use in thiscountry.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called the importing of producesprayed with these pesticides ``the circle of poison'' and said histop priority in this session of Congress is stopping the practice.   ``One-fourth of the produce we eat is imported,'' said Leahy.``That's 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man, womanand child'' a year.   While Agriculture Department inspectors have the power to stopfoods found to contain banned chemicals from entering the UnitedStates, Leahy's bill would prohibit the export of such pesticides.   In the last two years, inspectors have halted imports of beeffrom Honduras, pineapples from the Philippines and carrots fromLatin America after determining that the foods contained pesticidesbanned from use in the United States.   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural ChemicalsAssociation, said, however that Leahy's bill would hurt countriesthe United States is trying to help.   ``Some pesticides produced in the United States and soldoverseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlledis not a U.S. problem, or crops concerned are generally not grownin America, like coffee, rubber, cocoa, bananas, tea,'' said Vroom.   He said attempts to control how other countries useagrichemicals would amount to U.S. imperialism.   But Ms. Bolanos de Moreno said she would welcome the legislation.   U.S. shoppers buy large quantities of bananas from Ecuador,which also ships plantain, coffee, cocoa and sugar to the UnitedStates.   Ms. Bolanos de Moreno said Ecuador does not have the money orstaff to evaluate all the chemicals being offered for sale forcrops there.   ``In fact, we only have one person in charge of reviewing allstudies submitted for registration,'' she said.   ``The U.S. pesticide registration process is far more extensiveand permits regulators to evaluate all the risks associated with aproduct's use,'' she said.   She also said the current methods used by the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency to advise other countries on risks associatedwith certain chemicals aren't working.   She said her country has received few notices from the EPA aboutchanges it has made in regulations on pesticides. She said severalchemicals were removed from the U.S. market, but she was never toldof the actions.   EPA official Linda Fisher said her agency wants the law onexporting pesticides to be strengthened but is not in favor orLeahy's bill.   She said the EPA is working on strengthening its export policiesin hopes of fixing problems Ms. Bolanos de Moreno described.   Under questioning from Leahy, Ms. Fisher said the EPA presentlyhas no authority to stop a U.S. company from exporting a chemicalthat is banned here, even if the foreign country has said itdoesn't want it.   Furthermore, there is no agency within the federal governmentthat a foreign government can call if it wants to keep aU.S.-manufactured chemical out of its country, she said.   Leahy said his bill would not only prevent chemicals banned herefrom being exported, but also would stop any food sprayed withillegal pesticides from being imported. That would protectAmericans from companies that decide to manufacture the illegalchemicals elsewhere, the senator said.   Virtually the same legislation also has been introduced in theHouse and is awaiting hearings there.</TEXT></DOC>
