Republican party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and other topGOP officials pledged at a platform hearing here Thursday that theywill offer American voters a clear picture of what policies a Bushadministration will pursue _ in contrast to what they called thedeliberate vagueness of the Michael Dukakis-inspired Democraticplatform.   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the platform chairman, told reporters:``Every indication to me is that we will have much the sameplatform we had in 1984. ... We clearly have been successful withthe American electorate with that platform.''   She added that it would reflect ``a conservative politicalphilosophy.''   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., co-chairman of the platformcommittee, said the Republicans' 1984 vow not to raise taxes, at atime when Walter Mondale was promising a tax increase, ``was thebasis on which we won 49 states.''   Kasten called the Democrats' 2,000-word draft platform approvedin Denver last Saturday ``a bland compromise'' designed tocamouflage the true intentions of Dukakis and his party. But as theelection nears, Kasten said, ``the disguise will come off andMichael Dukakis will be exposed for the narrow-minded, liberal wolfin sheep's clothing that he really is.''   Kasten told reporters that while the 1988 GOP platform drawsheavily from the 1984 platform on taxes, the economy and defense,the Republicans must pay more attention this time to such issues asdrugs, AIDS, education and child care.   ``The debate and the discussion and the dissension will probablybe on those new issues which we're going to rassle with in theplatform committee,'' said Kasten.   Five members of what will ultimately be a 106-member GOPplatform committee presided at the day-long hearing on the economyand jobs, along with Fahrenkopf and Maureen Reagan, co-chairman ofthe Republican National Committee.   Fahrenkopf challenged the Democrats to ``meet us on thebattlefield of ideas'' with a platform that spells out ``not onlywhat we want to accomplish, but how we intend to get there.'' Hesaid the party platforms take on even more importance this year,the first presidential election in two decades without an incumbentin the race.   The GOP platform will actually be written in New Orleansstarting Aug. 8, the week before the convention.   At Thursday's hearing, drugs were a main concern.   The platform committee heard an assistant police chief of LosAngeles, Robert Vernon, call for draconian measures against drugsand drug-related crime, including denial of business andprofessional licenses to those who test positive for drugs.   ``We are approaching a civilization crisis _ a literalcivilization crisis,'' said Vernon, who called for a World WarII-like mobilization to fight drugs. ``It should be unpopular andcostly to abuse drugs in any form.''   Fahrenkopf and Kasten said later they felt taking away businesslicenses might be going too far. But the Wisconsin senator addedthat the toughest part of the drug issue ``for us to decide is themandatory vs. voluntary parts.''   Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said drug educationmust start in fourth grade, because it is too late once kids ``havehad the taste of big money'' from drug dealing. He said drugs weredraining hundreds of millions of dollars from the American economy,and he questioned why the U.S. keeps sending aid to countries wherethe drugs come from.   ``It's like handing a firearm to somebody who is threatening tokill you,'' said Block. ``There's no country in the world todaywho, short of a nuclear attack, could mount the kind of offensivethat would even come close to equalizing the level of death,destruction and human misery that is being generated by substanceabuse in this country.''   A black businessman, Barry Baszile, testified that drug dealersare entrepreneurs, too, and might turn to legal businessed ifeconomic development funds were available in black communities.   Two former rivals to George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. JackKemp, said that to keep the White House, the Republicans mustattract independent and cross-over Democratic voters.   Kemp told reporters flatly that he does not expect to be pickedby Bush as a running mate, and predicted Dole would be.   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job: ``I don't think it's aquestion of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning theelection, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'dwant to be majority leader if I had my choice.''</TEXT></DOC>
