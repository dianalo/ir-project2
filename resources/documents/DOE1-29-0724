Improvements have been reported in a wide varietyof materials and device configurations, and most can be attributed tonew solar cell designs, rather than improvements in the materials. Thesenew designs are reviewed, and the common features are highlighted andgeneralized into design rules. These design rules are then extended fromsingle-crystal devices to polycrystalline and thin-film solar cells,and then to tandem solar cells. It is shown that these design rules canbe used to predict the potential of any solar cell design in any materialsystem. These design rules suggest that substantial advances in solarcell performance can be expected from single-crystal InP and thin-filmpolycrystalline silicon in the near term, and thin-film polycrystallinedevices fabricated from GaAs and InP in the longer term.</TEXT></DOC>
