<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1017 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fuel injection system for a diesel engine is described comprising: (a)a fuel injection pump for delivering a controlled quantity of high pressurefuel cyclically at a timing synchronized with the operation of the engine;(b) a fuel injection nozzle hydraulically connected to the injectionpump for receiving high pressure fuel therefrom and injecting the fuelinto an engine cylinder; (c) means for controlling a rate of injectionof the system in response to operating conditions of the engine; and(d) passage means for providing, during each delivery stroke of the pumpplunger, fluid communication between the pumping chamber and the variablevolume chamber only for a predetermined initial phase of the deliverystroke. The variable volume chamber is hydraulically isolated from thepumping chamber during subsequent phases of the delivery stroke.</TEXT></DOC>
