(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,which has been up for sale while its Arizona-based parent preparedto file for bankruptcy protection, was seized by federal regulatorstoday.   The action against the 29-branch Sandamp;L was taken ``on the legalgrounds that the institution's assets had been substantiallydissipated and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsoundcondition,'' according to a news release issued by the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board.   On Thursday, the American Continental Corp., the luxury resortdeveloper that owns Lincoln, announced in Phoenix, Ariz., it wasseeking federal bankruptcy protection.   Martha Gravlee, a spokeswoman for the bank board, said businesswas being conducted as usual at all Lincoln branches. She saidrepresentatives from the bank board, the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp. and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were in theadministrative offices here and in Los Angeles.   But aside from a sign on the door, there was no noticeablechange in operations, she said.   The FSLIC will act as conservator and the FDIC will provide amanaging agent to oversee the association's operations.   F. Roger Clark was appointed by the bank board to serve as chiefexecutive officer. John H. Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman andchief executive officer on Tuesday, resigned those posts today.   Rousselot led a group of investors negotiating to buy thesavings and loan, which lost $36 million in the first nine monthsof 1988, but their offer was turned down because it failed toinclude enough cash.   ``Management appeared to operate Lincoln mainly for the benefitof American Continental Corp. at the expense of the institution,has repeatedly violated regulations relating to transactions withaffiliates, used poor underwriting and has refused to followsupervisory directives,'' the bank board statement said.   Lincoln Savings operates 29 branches in Southern California. Theassociation has $5.4 billion in assets, $5.1 billion in liabilitiesand $20 million in regulatory capital, the bank board said. As ofmid-1988, it was the state's 18th-largest thrift measured by assets.   The bank board said Lincoln's financial troubles started inFebruary 1984 when it was bought by American Continental.   ``Management abandoned the thrift's traditional operations topursue a rapid growth strategy based on soliticing brokereddeposits to purchase real estate and to fund high risk acquisition,development and construction loans, equity securities and junkbonds,'' the bank board said.   American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating said Thursdaythe bank board had changed rules as his company tried to sellLincoln and finally demanded that the company yield control ofLincoln to the FSLIC.</TEXT></DOC>
