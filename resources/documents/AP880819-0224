Yaacov Nimrodi, in 1985, helped arrange shipments of U.S.weapons to Iran. Some of the profits went to Nicaraguan rebels,known as Contras, fighting the Sandinista government.   The scheme was carried out despite a U.S. ban on arms sales toIran, at war with Iraq, and the lack of congressional approval formilitary aid to the Contras.   Israel helped deliver the arms to Iran and said it was acting atthe request of the United States, which hoped to obtain the releaseof Americans kidnapped in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.   The article by Nimrodi was published in the Jerusalem Post.   He said that in 1985 he and Israeli collegues Al Schwimmer andDavid Kimchi ``found the key to Iran, made the right connectionswith the right people and put them at the disposal of the U.S.''   ``Unfortunately a horrendous blunder was made,'' Nimrodi wrotein a rare public statement on the arms deal. ``Instead of homing inon the political dimension ... the contacts, in a most natural way,were permitted to spill over to talks on the release of hostages inexchange for U.S. arms.''   Nimrodi said he believes President Reagan hopes to secure therelease of the American hostages before his term ends in January,but added that focusing on the issue of the captives ``is apt toraise the price the Iranians will demand and make the release ofthe hostages more difficult.''   ``It is to be hoped that today the American (and Israeli)foreign policymakers have learned from past mistakes and willnavigate their contacts with Iran so as to restore Iran to itsnatural place _ the place where it wants to be and ought to be _much closer to the West,'' Nimrodi wrote.   ``The West will then achieve, three years later, what we soughtto achieve then.''   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held captivein Lebanon by Moslem militants. Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Nimrodi, 61, lived in Iran for 25 years, first as an agent forIsrael's Mossad intelligence agency and then as a military attacheand a private businessman.   Nimrodi wrote that for the first time since the Iran-Contrascandal the United States and Iran appear on the verge of improvingtheir relations.   He also said Iran's ``daring decision'' to agree to a cease-firewith Iraq in their eight-year-old war ``indicates, more thananything else, that beyond what appears to be the irrational,uncompromising and fanatical policy of the Iranian rulers, asignificant amount of logic and pragmatism can be discovered.''</TEXT></DOC>
