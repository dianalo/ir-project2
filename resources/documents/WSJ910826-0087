The agency's study, which offers few new revelations onthe state of the banking or thrift industries, nonetheless islikely to help keep the urgency of recapitalizing the BankInsurance Fund in the minds of lawmakers. The fund'sinsolvency is a central element of banking legislationalready approved by Senate and House Banking Committees andthe question is likely to come before the full legislativebodies as early as next month.</LP><TEXT>   The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., WilliamSeidman, has publicly said the fund would run out of moneybefore year end. Any outlay by Congress would be repaid bythe banking industry.   The GAO's report also notes that the Resolution TrustCorp.'s fund to close down sick thrifts will exceed its $80billion congressional outlay by $8 billion by year end. Whilethat conclusion also isn't new, and Congress is well on theway to granting the RTC more money as well, the two elementsof the report tie together the overwhelming costs of thefinancial crisis.   Separately, the FDIC said the deposit insurance fund grewslightly in the first half of the year after the agencyresolved an accounting dispute that sharply reduced thefund's size.   The FDIC said that the Bank Insurance Fund stood at $4.5billion on June 30, up from $4 billion at the end of 1990.The yearend figure was less than half the $8.4 billion thatthe FDIC earlier estimated was in the fund.   The higher midyear number reflects an earlier FDICdetermination that banks were failing at aslower-than-projected rate this year but that they expect ahigher failure rate next year. That would strain the fundnext year.   But the $8.4 billion figure was vigorously disputed by theGAO, Congress's watchdog agency, which argued that the FDIC'saccounting system was skewed and that the figure was severalbillion too high.   So the agencies met to hash out the differences in whatboth sides acknowledged was an accounting dispute. To resolvethe dispute, the FDIC increased its loss liability estimates,and the two sides now have agreed on how to estimate the sizeof the fund from now on. In accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles -- or GAAP -- the FDICrecognizes as a liability estimated losses from banks thathaven't failed but are likely to close.   Under the new accounting guidelines, the two agenciesagreed that contingent losses will be recognized for troubledbut still operating institutions if they meet one of twoconditions. They either must be &quot;equity insolvent,&quot; in whichtheir equity under GAAP is zero or less, based on the mostrecent financial reports, or the bank's earnings trend andfinancial condition must show that the bank is &quot;in substance&quot;equity insolvent.   Using the new standard, contingent lossses at the end of1990 would be $7.7 billion, about $4.3 billion above what theFDIC originally set.</TEXT></DOC>
