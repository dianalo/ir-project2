The move to introduce the first &quot;clone&quot; of IBM's second generation personal computers may prompt the clearest test yet of how aggressively IBM will protect the proprietary designs in the computers. It will also underscore Tandy's emergence in the past year as one of the biggest makers of IBM-compatible computers.    Michele Preston, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said she expects Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy to introduce the machine in April. Ms. Preston said she expects the Tandy model will use a chip set from Intel Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., that mimics the basic operations of the IBM computer.    However, a former Tandy employee, who asked not to be identified, said the key chip set would be made by Chips andamp; Technologies Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., company that makes chips used by a variety of clone makers to copy IBM's first generation personal computer line. The ex-employee said Tandy plans to announce the computer in mid-April, after rescheduling from a date set earlier in the month.    Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning, wouldn't comment on the assertions that the company will introduce a PS/2 clone. &quot;It's no secret that we and lots of other firms are working on it, but I can't say when we might have something,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be next week, it could be next month, it could be many months from now.&quot;    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Tandy shares closed at $40.25, off 50 cents.    IBM introduced its PS/2 line last April, partially in a bid to regain market share lost to lower-cost clones. IBM freely allowed other makers to copy the models in its PC line, started in 1981, to help establish its design in the face of competition from Apple Computer Inc. But inexpensive copies ate into IBM's sales, and with the PS/2 line IBM indicated it would guard its inventions more closely.    The most important change in the new line is what IBM calls the &quot;Micro Channel&quot; -- the newly designed electronic pathway between parts of the computer, such as the display and memory storage. But the dilemma for clone makers hasn't been whether PS/2 could be copied -- Chips andamp; Technologies has already announced that it has chips that mimic some of the PS/2 models -- but rather what IBM's response will be.    IBM declined to comment on the expected Tandy computer.    Small clone-makers are hesitant to take on the kind of expensive legal battle that may be involved. IBM, for its part, has said it will license its new designs to makers of its choosing.    &quot;Tandy is the only firm that has the guts to do it,&quot; said Tim Bajarin, vice president at Creative Strategies, a market research firm in Santa Clara, Calif. &quot;They are confident of their (computers) and confident of their corporate legal power.&quot; Although Mr. Bajarin expects Tandy to be first with a PS/2 clone, he said he isn't sure whether they will be able to produce it by April. &quot;Once they do show it, it's just a matter of submitting it to IBM to see what designs are infringed.&quot;    Ms. Preston said Tandy may side-step legal difficulties faced by other firms because it has cross-licensing agreements with IBM. Mr. Juge of Tandy said the company does have such agreements &quot;but whether they would cover the Micro Channel, I don't know.&quot;    Ms. Preston said Intel also has cross-licensing agreements with IBM that would ease legal difficulties. An Intel spokeswoman didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment. A Chips andamp; Technologies spokesman said the company &quot;continues to work with Tandy&quot; but wouldn't discuss when a PS/2 copy might be introduced.    &quot;Tandy being the first with a PS/2 copy makes a lot of sense to me,&quot; said Richard Shaffer, editor of an industry newsletter, the Computer Letter. &quot;Tandy has been trying to reposition itself as a technology leader and this would give a big boost to that image.&quot;    Though Tandy is expected to unveil the PS/2 clone in April, observers said the firm wouldn't be able to sell the machines in large quantities until late in the second quarter at the earliest. </TEXT></DOC>
