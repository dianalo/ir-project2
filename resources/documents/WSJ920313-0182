Tennis has yet to catch on in Shenzhen. But in thisbustling border community, separated by wire fencing from theBritish colony of Hong Kong, real estate is a game that manypeople are learning to play. One rule of the game is that adeveloper who lets his site sit idle risks having hisdevelopment rights rescinded. And this is where the tenniscourt comes in.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If you do something with the land, you stand a betterchance of keeping the authorities off your back untilwhenever you are ready to build,&quot; says Hazel Yeung, a HongKong businesswoman involved in the Wenjin Road development.   Taking heart from the country's renewed emphasis oneconomic liberalization, residential real-estate markets arecoming to life in China. Construction and sales are booming,especially in the south, with the blessing of free-wheelinglocal governments. Mortgage financing is readily available.Capital-gains taxes, theoretically at prohibitive levels, arenegotiable. So are limits on speculation.   Ranging from high-rises wrapped in marble to stuccoedvillas, these properties seem a world apart from the drabpublic housing in which the bulk of China's urban populationlives. Some are built and owned by the country's privilegedfew, notably nouveau riche entrepreneurs and governmentfunctionaries. But the bulk of the investment comes from theethnic Chinese of Hong Kong and Taiwan.   In Hong Kong itself, small-time investors are beingsqueezed out by sky-high property values. Taiwan's own marketis still hurting from its crash of 1990. For the bold and theunwary, Chinese real estate, with its immense potential forprofit and abuse, represents a brave new investment frontier.   In a country that has long gone without real-estatemarkets, some excitement over their resurrection is perhapsunderstandable. China's markets died after the CommunistParty seized power in 1949. They had begun a modest comebackin 1989 when a crackdown on pro-democracy protests silencedall talk of reform. Democracy remains taboo. But economicreform has since eased back into style, which makes propertyprices a fashionable barometer with which to gauge theascendency of the country's free marketeers over centralplanners.   That contest seems particularly lopsided in Shenzhen, aspecial economic zone whose success has added zest toproperty values. By most estimates, the Shenzhen marketstands at 70% above year-earlier levels. That is just anaverage figure. Shen Zhen Real Estate Express, asemi-official publication, routinely cites instances in whichprices have doubled or done better over the past year.   It was only in 1988 that the country placed propertytrading on a firm legal footing. The move leaves unchangedthe state's sole authority to grant land leases. What is newis the right of transfer between private parties during thelife of a lease, which normally runs between 50 and 70 years.In theory, that seems to bring China close to Hong Kong,where all land belongs to the British crown and is sold byleasehold. But that is in theory only.   In practice, such transfers can take place only wherepermitted. And they aren't permitted for all but a fewselected properties in any city. As a whole, the country isinching toward some form of privatization in which itscitizens can buy their currently rented homes, but subject tostate-set prices and tight limits on resale. What room thereis left for free markets constitutes just tiny pockets ofcapitalism within the socialist state.   These markets proliferate mostly in Guangdong, theprovince that encompasses Shenzhen. Some exist in neighboringFujian province, which is separated by a narrow strait fromTaiwan. Farther up the coast, big cities such as Shanghai andTianjin are starting to stir as well.   A building frenzy in the mid-1980s has saddled some ofthese cities with a glut of hotels and, to a smaller extent,of office towers. The market focus has since switched to thedevelopment of residential property for sale to individualinvestors. In the early 1980s, Hong Kong investor Shia Yeungset out to develop the stretch of farmland that encompassesthe Wenjin Road site with the new tennis court. His partnerin the project was government-owned Shenzhen Special EconomicZone Development Co. And they agreed to split profits evenly.   Now property prices are soaring. And the farmland is beingtransformed into a residential-commercial developmentsprawled over five city blocks. But instead of half theprofits, his partner wants more. More, at one point, meant90%. It now stands at 75% thanks to mediation by cityofficials. Still, having fought his Chinese partner, Mr. Shiahas faced nothing but hassle since.   His partner largely excludes him from management of theproject. On one occasion, the city also suspended his licenseto do business. And in a civil judgment that he is appealing,a Shenzhen court has ruled that Mr. Shia misappropriatedcompany funds. The upshot is that he now spends most of histime protesting and pleading with Chinese officials. Itremains far from clear whether he can recoup his investment,which he estimates at 32.5 million Hong Kong dollars (US$4.19million).   &quot;What's happening to us couldn't possibly be a veryencouraging signal for other investors,&quot; says Miss Yeung, whorepresents Mr. Shia in the joint-venture company, ShenzhenLian Cheng (Wenjindu) Joint Development Ltd.   While declining to go into specifics, the Chinese partnerflatly rejects Mr. Shia's grievances. &quot;We scrupulously abideby the law in everything we do,&quot; says Li Qiman, actinggeneral manager of the city's development company.</TEXT></DOC>
