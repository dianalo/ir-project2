United Artists, which last week said it plans to merge with cable operator United Cable Television Corp., said producer Frank Perry will head its new film unit, Corsair Pictures, which will make movies budgeted at $3 million to $10 million.    The theater and cable company, which isn't affiliated with the similarly named movie studio, may have a ready distribution channel for the new films; Corsair's products are likely to be shown on some of the company's 2,050 screens in 470 outlets. The company's film distribution unit, Taurus Entertainment, will likely distribute the movies to all theaters, though rival distributors may also be used.    Stewart D. Blair, president and chief executive officer of United Artists Communications, said he grew interested in forming a studio last year when he financed two films -- &quot;Compromising Positions&quot; and &quot;Hello Again.&quot; The company made a profit, &quot;but not half&quot; of what was made by the big-name studios that distributed the movies.    In addition to using its own screens and its own distribution unit, the company hopes its cable systems and those of United Cable may play an important role within a year. The cable systems may act as a pay-per-view outlet where the Corsair films could air after running in theaters.    Corsair's first project, based on the play, &quot;The Miss Firecracker Contest,&quot; and featuring &quot;Broadcast News&quot; star Holly Hunter and actress Mary Steenburgen, begins seven weeks of filming in June on a budget of less than $4 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, United Artists' stock closed at $30.24, down 12.5 cents; in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, United Cable's stock closed at $32.50, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
