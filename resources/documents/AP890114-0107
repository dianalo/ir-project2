The nation's 41st president is a man of aristocratic breeding anddown-home tastes. He enjoys country music, dropping by Sears to buypower tools, jogging a mile or two. His drink of choice is a vodkamartini, his idea of competitive sports is a good game ofhorseshoes, his suits are tailor-made.   During his campaign, Bush often joked that one of his hardesttasks during eight years as Ronald Reagan's vice president was``keeping my charisma in check.''   As Bush nears his inauguration, he has exhibited a salty,easygoing confidence that, if not everyone's idea of charisma, is atleast sharply at odds with the onetime perception of him as awkwardin public, whiny of voice, and wimpy in demeanor.   Bush still speaks in bursts and with a syntax that is oftenhaphazard. He sprinkles his conversation with phrases such as``going ballistic'' and ``I'm not going to get all tense,'' andtalks about ``the drug thing'' or the ``Persian Gulf thing.''   But Bush seems far more at ease with himself now, and hasexhibited a quick-wittedness, particularly in his dealings withreporters, that seemed to be missing in the past.   After avoiding regular contact with reporters during hiscampaign, Bush now admits that he relishes the give-and-take of newsconferences, and has held a dozen or so of them since his election.   His humor is often self-deprecating, as when a reporter recentlybegan a question: ``Mr. Vice President. Do you ever stop to think _''   ``Not often,'' Bush interrupted.   Bush, 64, said in a recent interview that he shared with wifeBarbara upon rising one morning a few days ago a sudden revelation:``I feel excited about this job.''   Bush has made it clear he intends to be up and about _ a prospectthat must make the Secret Service nervous and which doesn't makereporters' jobs any easier.   ``I'm not going to be isolated and cut off. Say I want to go buya suit. I want to eat Peking duck. And I don't want to have to spenda lot of time worrying about where people are. I want to say, `I'mready to go, let's go,'' he said.   Bush's forays into town are becoming legendary _ remindful of theunannounced trips President Lyndon Johnson used to take.   He buys bagels at a local delicatessen, makes frequent trips to aWashington men's shop to be fitted for suits, goes out himself tobuy presents for his wife, and often drops by the local Safeway topick up a few groceries.   Bush enjoys playing tennis with his family and with tennis pros,and as vice president and president-elect often dropped inunannounced at the gymnasium in the House Rayburn Office Building towork out with former colleagues.   He enjoys restaurants, often lingering for hours over meals withfriends and guests.   In his beloved vacation home of Kennebunkport, Maine, Bushfrequently takes unannounced walks through the village, patronizeslocal shops, takes his boat out for a spin, goes fishing, jogsthrough the neighborhood.   At his oceanside family compound, he uses one cottage as anoffice, where he does his own typing on an electric typerwriter setup at his desk.   On a recent visit, he shushed reporters asking him questionswhile he was fishing in a local river _ telling them not to scareaway the fish. However, he admitted, he never caught fish at thatparticular spot anyway. So why did he return there? ``I like tocast,'' he said.   He also enjoys throttling up his sleek 28-foot Cigarette boat,``Fidelity,'' crashing through Atlantic Ocean waves at speeds up to50 mph, sometimes appearing to relish in leaving a Coast Guard``chase'' boat in his spray.   Although Bush kept the boat in the Chesapeake Bay, nearWashington, one summer, he says he has no plans to move it to thePotomac River when he moves to the White House _ that wouldn't dojustice to the ocean-going craft, he says, comparing it to athoroughbred horse.   While Bush seems certain to continue his visits to the familyestate in Kennebunkport during warm weather, he has indicated heplans to spend a lot of time at Camp David, the presidential retreatin Maryland; and is reportedly eyeing the purchase of a condominiumin the Florida Keys, where he enjoys fishing.   The former oil industry executive, while claiming Texas as hisadopted home, does not back away from his New England roots or hisgood fortune at birth, once joking that his forefathers had come onthe Mayflower _ you could tell them because they all were holdingBloomingdale's shopping bags, he said.   But at the same time, he's a man who enjoys country music,watching rented video tapes and who sometimes drives around theNaval Observatory grounds, where the vice presidential residence islocated, because he's chauffeured everywhere else.   Then there's the Bush family enthusiasm for sports _ from tennisto horseshoes. When Bush talks about a ``six pack,'' he's nottalking beer _ although he's been known to enjoy one on occasion _but about wrapping successive horseshoes around the pole.   Bush once even suggested that horseshoes was ``the nationalsport,'' and has hinted he plans to install a horseshoe pit on theWhite House grounds.   Bush, trim at six-foot-two, runs several times a week, usuallydoing about two miles at a time.   And, while he is known to enjoy fine meals in good restaurants,he also has a fondness for junk food _ downing pork rinds andsmothering nearly everything in hot sauce, even tuna fish sandwiches.   The diet doesn't seem to have hurt his health. Bush has anenviable cholesterol count of 192.   Bush is being sworn in as president after serving as Reagan'svice president since 1981. It will be the first time Bush has servedin elective office, in his own right, since he represented Texas inthe House in the late 1960s.   In the years since, he served in a string of high-levelappointive posts, including ambassador to the United Nations, envoyto the People's Republic of China, chairman of the RepublicanNational Committee and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
