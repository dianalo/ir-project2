Poindexter to eliminate obstacles posed byusing government secrets in a trial.   In a motion filed a week after he announced plans to abandon thecharges, independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh asked for dismissialof wire fraud and theft of government property charges stemming fromthe diversion of U.S.-Iran arms sales to finance the Nicaraguanrebels.   Walsh also asked U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to narrow thescope of conspiracy charge against Poindexter to eliminate allreferences to the arms-sale diversion and clandestine efforts tohelp the Contras.   Poindexter would still be charged with conspiring to obstructcongressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair, two counts ofobstruction and two counts of making false statements tocongressional investigators in 1986.   ``Experience in the recently-completed trial of Oliver North hasmade clear that certain broad-reaching allegations... concerningdefendant's interaction with intelligence agencies andhighly-classified covert programs _ create the potential fordifficult problems in dealing with classified information,'' themotion said.   Prosecutors dropped the major Iran-Contra conspiracy chargesagainst North because intelligence agencies refused to allow publicdisclosure of government secrets the trial judge had ruled wereneeded by the defense.   Walsh said his decision to seek dismissal of the charges againstPoindexter was based discussions with intelligence agencies aboutthe former national security adviser's request for secret documents.   ``Although it might be possible to resolve those problems throughlimitations on the scope of discovery and proceedings udner CIPA(Classified Information Procedures Act), independent counselbelieves that the cost of such efforts, in terms of both delay andconsumption of resources of the court and the parties, would beexcessive,'' Walsh said.   No date has been set for Poindexter's trial.   North, a former National Security Council aide, is awaitingsentencing on three felony convictions arising from his involvementin the Iran-Contra affair.  </TEXT></DOC>
