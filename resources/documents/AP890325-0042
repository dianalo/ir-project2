Ilo Marie Grundberg says she was suffering a severe case of``Halcion intoxication'' when she shot and killed Mildred Coats onJune 19, 1988, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. DistrictCourt on Friday.   Grundberg, who once shared a home with her mother in thesouthern Utah city of Hurricane, faced a second-degree murdercharge until a judge dismissed the case, ruling the killing was theresult of her addiction to the prescription drug used in treatinginsomnia.   Grundberg is joined in the lawsuit by her daughter, Janice Gray,who both now live in Yucaipa, Calif. Gray represents Coats' estate.   The lawsuit contends that Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Mich., knew orshould have known that Halcion, known generically as triazolam,could cause intoxication in the user even when properly prescribedand used ``according to the advice and directions supplied by thedefendant.''   Among the possible reactions, the lawsuit claims, are ``severedepression, hallucinations, psychosis, organic brain damage,bizarre and profoundly disturbed behavior, amnesia'' and other sideeffects which, ``if not promptly discovered and treated, can leadto personal injury and death to the user and others in contact withthe user.''   Upjohn spokeswoman Nancy Heitzman declined to discuss thelawsuit Friday, saying company policy prohibited comment on pendinglitigation.   Grundberg, 57, admitted that on the night of her mother's death,she slipped a birthday card into the sleeping woman's hand _ thenext day was her 83rd birthday _ then shot her with a .22-caliberrevolver.   She then wrote a confession saying she loved her mother, butkilled her to spare her from what she described as troubledfinancial times ahead. She then called police.   An investigation, however, revealed the women were well offfinancially and that Coats had signed over all her assets toGrundberg. Police said they had no motive for the shooting.</TEXT></DOC>
