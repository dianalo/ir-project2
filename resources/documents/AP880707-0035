(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawsuit accusing a top defensecontractor of charging the government for everything from buildinga private plane to typing the Bible into a computer could open theway for fraud investigations into top-secret projects, a watchdoggroup says.   ``What we have is a little wedge into the `black' world,''projects so secret they often don't appear on the defense budget,said Dina Rasor, head of the Washington-based Project on MilitaryProcurement.   ``(It shows) you can expose fraud and waste in a black program''without divulging sensitive information, she said.   Rasor spoke at a news conference Wednesday to unseal the lawsuitalleging fraud and overcharging against Lockheed Missiles andamp; SpaceCo., the leading defense contractor in California's high-techSilicon Valley.   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by a former and acurrent employee, claims Lockheed workers, while waiting months forsecurity clearances, goofed off, ran profitable businesses, ran afootball pool and even built a private plane _ all at governmentexpense.   If proved, the charges could result in suspension of defensecontracts.   The alleged violations at one California plant cost thegovernment more than $10 million, but that figure could go higher,the plaintiffs' attorney said.   ``We expect additional people are going to step forward anddescribe additional examples of fraud at Lockheed,'' said Oaklandlawyer Guy T. Saperstein.   Lockheed, the plaintiffs also charged, told employees to billvarious government contracts for 40 hours even if they worked lessand to charge their time to contracts on which they had not worked.   Lockheed denied the accusations.   ``We very vigorously deny that false claims have been or aremade or condoned by the company,'' said company spokesman GeorgeMulhern. ``In fact, we've had a very strong program over the pastseveral years to make sure all employees know any form ofmischarging is wrong and can lead to disciplinary action, includingdismissal, if warranted.''   Mulhern said the company would wait until it receives a copy ofthe suit before responding to specific allegations.   ``(But) we are also very confident the suit, if it goes totrial, will show the company has not engaged in any improperpractices,'' he said.   Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space, with 23,700 employees in Sunnyvale,develops spacecraft, satellite systems and submarine-launchedmissiles. It is a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp.   The suit was filed under a federal whistle-blower law byMargaret T. Newsham, 45, a former Lockheed analyst, and MartinOverbeek Bloem, 34, an engineer who works for the company. TheUnited States also is a plaintiff.   The law protects whistle-blowers from retaliation and allowsthem to keep some of the judgments against companies convicted ofcheating the government.   The complaint, which seeks damages and a jury trial, is one ofthe first false claims suits involving a classified ``black''project for the National Security Agency, a surveillance branch ofthe Defense Department.   Newsham and Bloem, who both held security clearances from theNSA, worked at Lockheed on the project from 1981 to 1984.   They allege that ``a huge amount'' of time was wasted atLockheed in the ``ice box,'' a period ranging from a year to 18months during which employees could not work on sensitive projectsuntil they received security clearance.   ``Rather than being given non-classified work, their time waswasted,'' Saperstein said. ``When the end of the week rolledaround, they billed the United States government for 40 hours forno work, essentially.''   Employees allegedly found ways to keep busy, including sellingreal estate, honey and belt buckles or working on their cars orplaying computer games.   One senior manager, the suit says, had Lockheed machinists buildhim an airplane and was allowed to retire and take the plane withhim when the project was discovered.   ``One Lockheed employee wrote out the entire Bible onto aLockheed computer, charging government contracts for his time,''the suit says.   Newsham was fired in 1984. She said the company refused to givea reason.   The Defense Contract Audit Agency substantiated the allegationsafter Newsham called a Defense Department ``hot line'' in 1984,Saperstein said. Reports from the agency, which has no enforcementpower, were filed with the suit.</TEXT></DOC>
