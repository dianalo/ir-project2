Dewhurst is one of many AgricultureDepartment employees who were notified this week that they would betaking an unpaid furlough later this year.   In all, some 2.4 million federal workers are being told of thelayoffs that will come if Congress and the White House fail tosolve the government's budget problems.   Dewhurst is USDA's budget director and feels closer to thetechnical aspect of the problem than most.   But a report Tuesday by his office showed the plan to save moneyunder a ``sequester'' plan to cut spending would have far-reachingeffects.   There would be lower subsidies for major commodities, and needyfarmers would have less of a chance to get housing and operatingloans, the report said.   Perhaps as many as 90,000 USDA employees, roughly 90 percent ofthe department's permanent work force, would be affected one way oranother by the layoffs.   It would affect chicken inspectors and economists, scientistsand file clerks, highly paid executives and those at the bottom ofthe scale, the report warned.   The layoff notices and other measures are in the works just incase Congress and the Bush administration don't come up with an11th-hour rescue for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.   Citing the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, the White Househas ordered an across-the-board cut of federal spending to beginOct. 15 if no budget agreement is reached.   About $22.9 billion of USDA's projected outlays would beaffected. Food stamps and child nutrition programs generally areexempt from the cuts.   The USDA study anticipates cuts of 31.9 percent, or $7.3 billionfrom affected programs.   ``Farm price support payments and many other USDA loan and grantprograms would be severely reduced,'' the report said.   The report added: ``The necessity to lay off employees woulddisrupt USDA services throughout the world and especially at USDAcounty offices throughout rural America. Producers and industriesdependent on the availability of USDA programs and services wouldbe severely affected.''   For example, so-called deficiency payments to farmers for nextyear have been projected at about $3 billion; a 31.9 percent cutwould be more than $900 million.   Dairy farmers would be assessed approximately 8.7 percent per100 pounds of milk marketed, which would reduce cash receipts bynearly $130 million.   In state and county offices of the department's AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, where the programs areadministered, salaries and expenses would be reduced by the samepercentage. More than 20,300 employees of the county offices wouldbe furloughed. Offices would be closed Mondays and Fridays.   Dewhurst said he and others in the USDA budget office hadreceived letters that they would be furloughed three days out ofevery 10.   ``You can get a 50-50 bet, I suppose, from people who think itwon't happen at all and those who think (cuts) will be 40percent,'' he said.   The Office of Management and Budget has already boosted itsestimate of spending cuts to 32.4 percent, and Dewhurst said thatcould balloon further.   Only about $600 million of the $23 billion in food programswould be subject to the cuts.   Food stamps alone account for around $16 billion or so. But thecurrent food stamp law runs out in 1991.   ``If, as everybody expects, the food stamp program isreauthorized, it will drive federal spending up,'' Dewhurst said.``You'd see the (cuts) go to somewhere between 38 and 40 percent.''   That would put a further bite on commodity price supportoperations, the Farmers Home Administration, food aid to foreigncountries, conservation, research and the other eligible programs.   According to the report, using the ``planning'' cut of 31.9percent, farmers also would see their government checks for pricesupport loans reduced by that amount.   The loans are commonly made at harvest time so farmers haveoperating money to tide them over. If market prices rise later,farmers usually pay off the loans and then sell their products forcash.   If the cuts are carried out, it will mean about $1.8 billionless for farmers taking out crop loans next year, according to 1991budget projections.   ``A 31.9 percent sequester would greatly complicate programadministration and would introduce instability into commoditymarkets,'' the report said.   In the case of meat and poultry inspection, where most USDAspending is vested in the salaries of employees, a 31.9 percentspending cut was said to ``result in the absence of inspectionservices during a furlough of about 137 days,'' effectivelyshutting down the slaughtering and processing industries for thatamount of time.   ``The economic loss from a shutdown would result in the loss ofbillions of dollars to the American economy,'' the report said.   Further, it said, the limited inspection that would be availablewould not be sufficient to prevent an erosion of ``the high levelof safety'' in the nation's meat and poultry products and ``wouldfocus public criticism on the federal government.''</TEXT></DOC>
