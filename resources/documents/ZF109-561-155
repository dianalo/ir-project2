revenues of $2.47 billion.andM;Earnings per share increased 5.9 percent compared to the third quarter ofl989, or 72 cents to 68 cents in l989.andM;The third quarter net income was up 2.5 percent compared to the like periodin l989, or $285 million versus $278 million in l989.andP;  Total revenuesincreased to $2.47 billion from $2.37 billion in the third quarter in l989.andM;However, as described last year, third quarter 1989 results included threerevenue reductions without which earnings per share would have been 73 centsand net income would have been $298 million.andM;Third quarter, l990 earnings continue to recover from levels experiencedearlier in the year due to the adverse effects of the annual $391 millionPacific Bell rate reduction that accompanied a major restructuring oftelecommunications regulation in California.andP;  The $391 million rate reductionis offset in part by $72 million in lower settlement payments for intrastatepooling.andM;&quot;Our core business continues to produce strong earnings through growth inaccess lines, customer usage and cellular customer growth.andP;  Expenses arewell-managed and their increases are under the rate of inflation,&quot; said SamGinn, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacific Telesis Group.andM;&quot;California's diversity and size should help insulate the state frompotentially severe economic downturns and help maintain its level of growthabove the other regions in the nation,&quot; Ginn added.andM;PacTel Cellular's net income for the quarter was $21.3 million compared to$15.9 million for the third quarter of l989, a 34.0 percent increase.andM;Revenues rose 28.3 percent to $149.5 million.andP;  Cellular now serves 472,000customers, up 38.4 percent over the like period a year ago.andM;Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell now have 14.1 million lines in service, anincrease of 3.8 percent from a year ago.andM;Toll messages for the two local exchange companies grew 8.3 percent comparedto the third quarter in l989 to 874 million and minutes of use increased 9.0percent to approximately 10.6 billion.andM;Expenses in the third quarter rose $78 million over the like period last yearand were primarily due to increases for depreciation, improvements in thetelephone network and internal operating systems and union contract-relatedlabor costs.andP;  Somewhat offsetting these expenses, the work force hasdecreased by 1,744 employees since the first of the year.andM;&quot;While we have great faith in the 90's, we must be diligent in preparing thecorporation to meet the future, which includes more competition and a moredemanding consumer body, with new technologies and employees that assume evergreater responsibility for improving the quality of our services,&quot;
