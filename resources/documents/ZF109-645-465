Box 7210,1901 Landings Dr., Mountain View, CA 94039; (415) 962-8910.andM;List Price: $249.andM;Requires: 512K RAM, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: One of the simplest to use of all word processors, ProfessionalWrite comes with n address book built in and, for apersonal/professional-class program, provides strong printer support,including automatic envelope printing.andP;  Its functions aren't in the league ofcorporate-class programs, and reefs of inconvenience intrude on its sea ofsimplicity, but Professional Write offers surprisingly easy sailing.andM;Sometimes a ten-speed bicycle gets you there faster than a ten-wheel truck.andO;If you use a word processor mostly to write memos, letters, and reports, andyou want a quick and efficient system for form letters built in, ProfessionalWrite will give you almost everything you need.andP;  Software Publishing Corp.'s$249 executive word processor performs all its functions with clarity andelegance and combines simplicity and efficiency in a way unmatched by anyother program.andM;If you can read a menu, you can probably use Professional Write withoutopening the manual.andP;  The program leaves out many of the advanced functionsthat no professional word processor should be without, but it includes asurprising number of features that users of those professional programs mightenvy.andM;REASSURING REALISMandM;Professional Write is designed for users who learned to write on atypewriter.andP;  The ruler on the bottom line resembles the margin and tab ruleron your old Remington, and the editing screen displays the white spacesurrounding the text on the printed page, complete with headers and footers.andO;When you type near the head or foot of a page, the bottom margin of the firstpage and the top margin of the next page fill much of the editing screen, butthe reassuring realism may be a compensation for the waste of space.andM;Even the Tab key works the way it does on a typewriter: It moves the cursorover existing text instead of pushing text forward as in virtually all otherword processors.andP;  If you want to push a column of text from one tab stop tothe next, you can cut the rectangular block containing the text, move thecursor to the tab stop you want, and paste the block.andM;Block operations are especially elegant.andP;  When you finish defining the block,a menu pops up with a list of things you can do with it, ranging fromstandard cut-and-paste to changing the font, text attribute, or margin andtab settings.andP;  You can also save the block as a file, optionally encryptedlike any Professional Write file.andP;  Or if the block contains numbers, you cantransfer them to a pop-up calculator that lets you paste the result ofarithmetic operations (including averaging) back into the text.andP;  If the blockconsists simply of a series of numbers without arithmetic operators, thecalculator is smart enough to put plus signs between them.andP;  You can changethese to other operators in the pop-up screen.andM;WELL-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONSandM;Professional Write keeps a list of function keys at the top of the screen toindicate how to access a set of well-designed menus.andP;  Clear,context-sensitive help is always available by pressing F1, and the helpwindow lets you see much of the screen beneath.andP;  Most of the menu items haveCtrl-key equivalents, and virtually every option in the program (except someobscure commands that you can insert directly in a document for overridingautomatic formatting) is available from the menus.andP;  The obscure commands aredescribed in the help screens.andM;Among the well-implemented functions that you may not expect to find in aprogram of this class are a spell-checker, a thesaurus, and cursorline-drawing.andP;  (The diagonals don't look every smooth because they're madewith line-draw characters unless you specify something different.)andP;  You canimport standard spreadsheet files or named ranges from them.andP;  Like MultiMate,Professional Write incorporates the grammar-checker Grammatik IV, but in amuch more sleek and sensible way.andP;  MultiMate slowly loads the Grammatikmodule, then gives you options to insert placemarks in your file or pause andedit.andP;  However, it doesn't let you move very far around the file until youexit grammar checking.andM;Professional Write, in contrast, instantly starts checking, pops up a screenwith suggestions, and allows you to edit the text.andP;  It doesn't offer theoption to litter your file with placemarks that you don't need.andP;  You caneasily record macros with built-in pauses for input, and all your macros arelisted on a menu.andP;  You are able to import graphs, but only from HarvardGraphics or other Software Publishing programs.andM;Professional Write includes an ingenious page preview that lets you changefonts and immediately see the result.andP;  Because the program's editing screenassumes that you are printing in a fixed-pitched font, you have to go to thepreview screen to see where line and page breaks will occur if you areproportional fonts and want them spaced properly.andP;  If you don't like the lookof the parts of your file that are in times Roman 10, you can switch one ormore of those areas into Helvetica 12.andM;You can use any standard LaserJet cartridge and the most common soft fonts,and you can use buil-in PostScript fonts.andP;  Scalable PostScript and LaserJetIII fonts are supported, but only in few preselected point sizes.andO;Unfortunately, the program supports only single or double line spacing at sixlines per inch, so most proportional fonts will print with awkward leading.andM;One of the function keys on Professional Write's menu takes you to a built-inaddress database with present fields.andP;  You can transfer an address directlyto a file, and the program can automatically lift the address from the fileand print it on an envelope.andP;  You can also merge-print envelopes from theaddress database, or use the database for any other merge-printing.andO;Professional Write can also use data from dBASE or Professional File anddisplay a meny that lists the field names from the database.andP;  Here you canenter codes fro selecting or sorting records and even tell the program toinsert a field from the database to an unmatched field identifier in yourmerge document.andM;ODD LIMITATIONSandM;Not everything in Prefessional Write is convenient.andP;  You can't simply turn onunderlining or italics but must mark a block of already entered text andchoose the new text attribute from a menu.andP;  You can underline or boldindividual words with a Ctrl-key combination, but the spaces between thewords won't be underlined unless you underline a whole block of words atonce.andP;  Oddly, you can't close up the space between the word at the end of aline and the word at the start of the next with the Backspace or Del key; youmust insert or delete enough text to move the two words to the same line,where you can delete the space between them.andM;Yoo can't change default margins or tabs, but you can save a blank formattedfile as a template for other files.andP;  You can only print in the foreground, soprepare to get a cup of coffee instead of going back to work when you print along file.andM;When you retrieve a file created by another word processor--most majorformats are supported--Professional Write tends to leave hard returns inplace of the soft returns in the original file.andP;  You'll have to fix the filemanually because the search function can't find or replace a returncharacter.andM;Professional Srite doesn't support footnotes, nonprinting, comments, columns,or other advanced format features.andP;  More surprisingly, it doesn't come withan installation program.andP;  If you use it on a hard disk, you have to create adirectory and copy the files manually.andP;  This omission can leave a bad initialtaste in the mouths of the computer novices for whom the program is designed.andO;But once you get started, you'll find very little to complain about in thiscompact and well-designed package</TEXT></DOC>
