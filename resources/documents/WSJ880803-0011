But this month she will be watching fraud investigations from a new perspective. Last week, Ms. Toensing, who supervised major defense procurement probes, left the government for the Wall Street firm of Hughes Hubbard andamp; Reed, where she will specialize in defending government contractors accused of white collar crimes.    Her move, and other recent trips taken by Justice Department officials through Washington's revolving door, have Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), a member of the senate panel, fuming. Several lawyers now defending clients in the Pentagon probe are veterans of the Justice Department's fraud section, which Ms. Toensing supervised.    &quot;The impression taxpayers have is that Justice Department officials like Toensing seemed more interested in future employment prospects than with prosecuting defense fraud,&quot; Sen. Grassley said through a spokesman. &quot;Whether true or not, that's what can be so harmful about the revolving door.&quot;    Ms. Toensing, however, notes that federal conflict-of-interest laws bar her from directly representing any clients targeted in the current probe for at least two years. She intends to specialize in conducting internal compliance audits and internal investigations for defense contractors -- before they get on the wrong side of the law.    &quot;Sen. Grassley should be delighted that I'll be in there keeping these companies out of trouble,&quot; says Ms. Toensing. Also, Ms. Toensing emphasizes that her political appointment as deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division was only guaranteed through the end of the Reagan administration. &quot;It's a special calling, but you can't stay forever,&quot; she says.    Although she has had no time in private practice, Hughes Hubbard hired Ms. Toensing, who has 13 years of experience as a prosecutor, to launch its white collar practice in Washington. Wall Street law firms have traditionally eschewed criminal defense work.    &quot;I'll be doing the kind of dirty stuff Wall Street used to avoid,&quot; Ms. Toensing observes. Last year, another Wall Street firm, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, hired a high-profile criminal defense lawyer, Thomas Puccio, to spearhead its white-collar practice. </TEXT></DOC>
