Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   When Michael Dukakis met with a group of hawkish Democratic defense specialists last year, he impressed them -- though perhaps not quite the way he had hoped. &quot;I was very favorably impressed,&quot; says Robert Komer, a veteran of several Democratic administrations and a founder of Democrats for Defense. &quot;He's quick. He's alert. He's forceful. He also was not terribly knowledgeable.&quot;    With Mr. Dukakis now the Democrats' candidate-apparent, the Bush campaign is already attacking him as a callow liberal on defense and foreign policy. So far, Mr. Dukakis is handing Mr. Bush plenty of ammo. Anyone who spends a few hours reading his speeches and talking to Democrats familiar with his views learns quickly that Mr. Dukakis has absorbed many of the dovish obsessions of his party's left. Some sober-minded Democrats nonetheless argue that Mr. Dukakis is smart, tough and educable, not unlike another governor inexperienced in foreign affairs a decade ago. But if Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) is going to take on that educating job as vice president, he should at least know what he's up against.    Mr. Dukakis reflects, for example, his party's post-Vietnam confusion about when the U.S. should use military force. He acknowledges the rare need for force &quot;as a last resort,&quot; but he nearly always opposes it when it's resorted to. He criticized the Grenada invasion. He would use force against terrorists, says adviser Madeleine Albright, but he opposed the strike against Libya because &quot;we don't know if it was an attempt to assassinate a head of state {Gadhafi}, and that's illegal.&quot; Last week he did a pirouette around the issue of U.S. retaliation in the Persian Gulf, saying he had &quot;insufficient information.&quot;    Rather than have the U.S. act like a superpower, Mr. Dukakis prefers &quot;multilateral&quot; diplomacy. He has a faith that only a liberal could have in international due process. &quot;There's nothing strong about wandering around the Persian Gulf without a mine sweeper,&quot; he says. &quot;But there's strength in demanding tough multilateral sanctions to stop the war between Iran and Iraq&quot; -- demands, of course, that have been routinely ignored. Napoleon said about war that if you decide to take Vienna -- take Vienna. Mr. Dukakis would ask the Organization of American States to take Vienna.    Albert Gore attacked this mindset as &quot;naive legalism,&quot; but it may be something worse, a basic loss of faith in America's moral purposes. Liberals like Mr. Dukakis used to believe in Wilsonian internationalism; now they save their moral outrage for American intervention. The Reagan administration, Mr. Dukakis says, &quot;has tried to manipulate nations, when it should have tried to understand them.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis is also obsessed with nuclear weapons, even those that defend us. He says he believes in nuclear deterrence, but he opposes programs crucial to modernizing U.S. nuclear forces. He dislikes both the MX and Midgetman missiles, though other Democrats are the Midgetman's biggest supporters. He'd put off deploying the Trident D-5 missile and the Stealth bomber, waiting to see how arms control turned out. SDI, he says, is a &quot;fantasy.&quot; If President Reagan's strategy has been to deploy weapons and then negotiate from strength, Mr. Dukakis favors not deploying and then urging the Soviets to match our show of goodwill.    The governor even favors a ban on missile flight tests, an idea that is a cousin of the 1984 &quot;nuclear freeze&quot; and one that was marketed around the Iowa caucuses by deep thinkers from the Stop the Arms Race Political Action Committee. A flight-test ban eventually would strip us of confidence that our nuclear deterrent would work if the U.S. were attacked. Sophisticates call this strategy &quot;minimal deterrence,&quot; which is at least truth-in-advertising.    Moderate Democrats have tried to make these points to Mr. Dukakis, but to little effect. &quot;The thing that struck several of us,&quot; says a member of a group that has met with him, &quot;was his total belief in the flight test ban . . . that we don't need to do much about strategic weapons, even for survivability. . . . I didn't think he even had an open mind on the subject.&quot; Mr. Dukakis implies that nuclear weapons are a more frightening enemy than the Soviets who aim them at us.    It's possible, of course, that Mr. Dukakis will move to the center now that he needs to appeal less to his party's peaceniks. And he does say sensible things about conventional arms, NATO and negotiating with terrorists. One other good sign, surprisingly, is his advisers. My hawkish sources say good things about Ms. Albright, a Georgetown professor and once an aide to Zbigniew Brzezinski at the National Security Council; Albert Carnesale, a SALT negotiator now at Harvard's Kennedy School; and Robert Murray, a former navy undersecretary also at Harvard. Mr. Dukakis is also said to be talking regularly with New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, another rare voice of Democratic reason.    If Mr. Dukakis wanted to, of course, it's even possible he could run to the right of George Bush on foreign policy. With Mr. Bush's passion for arms treaties and President Reagan's discovery of a new kind of Soviet leader, an opening like Jack Kennedy's 1960 &quot;missile gap&quot; might just exist. But then again, on the evidence of Mr. Dukakis's positions so far, that kind of re-education is probably too much to expect even from a Vice President Nunn. </TEXT></DOC>
