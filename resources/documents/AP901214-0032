The president was joined at Thursday's celebration around the35-foot blue spruce by his wife Barbara and several Bushgrandchildren. Five of the seven newly released hostages who metwith Bush earlier in the day also attended.   ``As we gather here, we're doing what generations before us havedone, watching our national Christmas tree become a brilliantsymbol of hope, of peace and of compassion for all the world,'' thepresident said as he illuminated the tree.   The National Park Service estimated that about 15,000 peoplewatched the ceremony on an unusually warm evening in the capital.   The national Christmas tree is a living tree transplanted to itspermanent spot in the Ellipse in 1978.   The theme for this year's ``Pageant of Peace'' nationalChristmas tree celebration is discovery. Four thousand lightsdecorate the tree and a white star shines from the top.   Surrounding the tree are 57 smaller trees representing eachstate and territory, a tradition since 1981. For the first timethis year, the trees were grown on land from a reclaimed mine in aneffort by the Park Service to demonstrate the use of recycled land.   Presidents have been lighting the nation's tree in the Ellipsejust south of the White House every year except two since CalvinCoolidge first threw the switch in 1923.   In 1979, President Carter ordered that the tree remain dark tohonor Americans hostages being held in Iran. In 1980, the tree waslighted for only 417 seconds - one second for each day the hostageshad been in captivity.</TEXT></DOC>
