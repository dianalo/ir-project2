<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0572 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experimental method for measuring the thermal conductivity and convectioncoefficient of borosilicate glass cylinders, containing a simulated highlevel radioactive waste, is described. A simulation of the thermal behaviourof matrices of solidified waste during the cooling in air, water anda geological repository has been done. The experimental values of thethermal conductivity are ranging from 0.267 to 0.591 w/m K, for matriceswith simulated waste contents of 10 to 40% (the waste is simulated byno radioactive isotopes). The convection coefficient for air/cylidersunder the operating conditions used is 116 w/m{sup 2} K. The simulatedoperation of cooling in air shows that about 1-2 days are enough to coola solidified waste cylinder 0.6 m diameter from 900 to 400{omega}C. Thecooling under water from 400 to near 80{omega}C is faster than in air,but sharp temperastujre gradients within the matrices could be expected.The simulation of geological repositories lead to some criteria of arrangingthe matrices for avoiding undesirable high temperature points.
