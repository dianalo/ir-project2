Thu trading bloc opened two days of discussions with a Sovietdelegation led by Ivan Ivanov, vice president of the Soviet statecommission for foreign economic affairs.   The meetings, described as exploratory talks, are designed to geta feeling for what each side would like to see in any agreementlater worked out in negotiations.   During previous contacts, the Soviets indicated they would beinterested in an agreement with the wealthier European countriescovering a wide variety of areas, including high technology. Thetransfer of such sensitive technology to Moscow is tightlycontrolled.   ``They asked for everything,'' De Clercq said in an interviewbefore the talks. ``It is a question if the community can accept orwill accept .. so broad a cooperation that is very likely going tobe asked.''   De Clercq said an agreement with the Soviet Union could covercooperation in the environment, energy, transportation and exchangeof information and statistics.   West European businessmen are interested in gaining greateraccess to the Soviet marketplace, he said.   The trading bloc, also known as the Common Market, generallyworks out agreements with other countries that lead to greatertrade. But the Soviet Union has limited products that West Europeancountries would be interested in buying.   De Clercq said any serious negotiations on such a pact likelywould not take place until next year at the earliest.   The Common Market nations imported $15.2 billion in goods fromthe Soviet Union in 1987 and had exports totaling $10.7 billion,according to EEC figures.   The improved East-West relationship has raised some concern thatMoscow will gain access to high technology that could improve itsmilitary might.   ``There is this concern about transfer of technology,'' saidAlfred H. Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the European Economic Community.   ``We all feel strongly that whatever is happening in EasternEurope could be used to our mutual advantage,'' he said.   The export of sensitive Western technology such as supercomputersis controlled by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee forMultilateral Export Controls, which maintains a list of itemsembargoed for export to the Soviet bloc.   The discussions with the Soviets are the latest in a seriesrecent trade talks the community has held with the East.   In June, the Common Market signed a declaration establishingofficial relations with the 10-nation Soviet-led socialist economicbloc, called the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.   In September, the Common Market signed a trade and economiccooperation agreement with Hungary and recently finishednegotiations on a trade accord with Czechoslovakia.   Common Market members are Britain, Ireland, Denmark, France,Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Portugal,Italy and Greece.</TEXT></DOC>
