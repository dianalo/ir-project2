(``Amex'') filed withthe Commission a proposed rule change under the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 (``Act''). As discussed below, the proposal provides for the acceleratedcomparison of securities transactions. Notice of the proposal was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 26, 1989, to solicit comments from interestedpersons.\1\<NOTE/> No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26741 (April 18, 1989),54 FR 18058.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>The rule change consists of proposed Amex Rule 719, which, in essence,would require that each regular way trade in stocks, rights, and warrantsbe compared or otherwise closed out by the close of business on the businessday following the trade date (<T3>i.e.,</T3> T+1). Under existing Amex rules, such trades must be comparedor closed out by T+5. Thus, the proposal, when implemented, would shortena transaction's comparison cycle by four business days. The proposal, however,would have no effect on the settlement of transactions, the majority ofwhich would continue to settle on T+5.Amex states in its filing that it has been working for more than a yearwith the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''),\2\<NOTE/> the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''),\3\<NOTE/> and the member firm community to establish the systems andrules necessary to implement T+1 comparison. Amex's proposed Rule 719 (whichis an enabling rule, not a rule of implementation) directs Amex membersand member organizations to comply with such other rules and proceduresas may be adopted by Amex or NSCC for: (1) The comparison or settlementof transactions, (2) the resolution of uncompared or questioned trades,and (3) the collection and submission of audit trail data.\4\<NOTE/> Amex also notes in its filing that its Rule 719, like NYSERule 130 (<T3>i.e.</T3>, NYSE's compare or close out rule), will require up to 18months to implement fully, as measured from the date that the Commissionapproved the rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Commission already has approved a parallel NYSE rulefiling. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989),54 FR 11470 (File No. SR-NYSE-88-36).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For the NSCC's companion rule filing to NYSE Rule 130and proposed Amex Rule 719, a filing recently approved by the Commission,<T3>see</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27074 (July 28, 1989),54 FR 32405 (File No. SR-NSCC-89-04). <T3>See also,</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26783 (May 4, 1989),54 FR 20221 [File No. SR-NSCC-89-02].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Amex has advised the Commission that it plans to adopta series of procedures within the general framework of Rule 719 wherebythe implementation of Rule 719 would be carried forward. Telephone conversationbetween Paul G. Stevens, Executive Vice President for Operations, Amex,and Thomas C. Etter, Attorney, SEC (June 16, 1989).Amex has informed the Commission that it desires to commence a phase-inof accelerated trade comparison operations on Saturday, August 19, 1989.This would be in conjunction with an industry-wide effort, including NYSEand NSCC, to begin accelerated comparison on that date. Specifically, Amexintends to shorten by 24 hours (from T+3 to T+2) its trade comparison cycleand its trade correction cycle (primarily affecting trades executed twodays previously on Thursday, August 17, 1989).\5\<NOTE/> Amex states, however, that its automated trade correctionsystem will not be operational by August 19, 1989, and that, consequently,Amex will use an improved version of its existing manual correction system,which has been modified to shorten its cycle by the necessary 24 hours.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Telephone conversation between George Stokes, AssistantVice President, Amex, and Thomas C. Etter, Attorney, SEC (August 16, 1989).<T3>See</T3> Amex Information Circular, No. 89-131, dated August 15, 1989;NSCC Important Notice, No. A3218, dated July 18, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Telephone conversation between George Stokes, AssistantVice President, Amex, and Thomas C. Etter, Attorney, SEC (August 16, 1989).<T3>See</T3> NSCC Important Notice, No. A3218, dated July 18, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale for the Proposal</ITAG>Amex believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Actin that it would facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlementof securities transactions. Moreover, Amex states in its filing that shorteningthe comparison cycle for regular-way equity trades to T+1 would improvethe marketplace because it would increase the efficiency of the post-tradecomparison process and reduce the time span its member organizations areexposed to the risk of market fluctuations on uncompared trades.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act. TheCommission believes that the proposal, by shortening the comparison cyclefor Amex equity trades, would benefit the marketplace by reducing the riskexposure to investors and to Amex members and by contributing to the promptand efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission reiterates that the proposed rule change is similar to anNYSE proposed rule change already approved by the Commission.\7\<NOTE/> For the reasons discussed in the order approving that NYSEproposal, the Commission believes that the instant proposal, upon implementation,would reduce the length of the processing cycle for Amex trades and, morespecifically, make Amex's trades: (1) Safer with regard to the risks ofmarket price volatility, and (2) more efficient in terms of the time andexpense involved in trade processing. Further, the proposal would helpprotect investors and other persons that safeguard investors' funds andfacilitate their transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See, supra, </T3>note 2. The Commission, nevertheless, is concerned that: (1) Amex has no automatedtrade correction system yet in operation; \8\<NOTE/> and (2) Amex has not yet filed a rule proposal with the Commissionregarding the implementation of accelerated comparison and an automatedcorrection system. The Commission expects that Amex will file such implementingrules soon. The Commission is approving this proposed rule change now toenable Amex to take part in the industry-wide phase-in on August 19, 1989,and expects that, as a result of these operations, Amex will have the necessaryknowledge to develop the implementing rules and procedures concerning T+1comparison and automated trade correction. Accordingly, this approval orderis effective on a temporary basis through December 31, 1989.\9\<NOTE/> Permanent approval of this proposal (<T3>i.e., </T3>Amex Rule 719) will be conditioned on the filing and approvalof implementing rules and procedures for accelerated comparison and automatedtrade correction as discussed above. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Section 17A(a)(1) of the Act expressly contemplates thegoal of prompt and efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions(including the comparison of securities transactions) and the use of automatedsystems to achieve that goal. The Commission regards T+1 automated tradecomparison as an important interim step toward the longer-term goal ofsame-day trade comparison and views automated trade resolution as a necessarycomponent of accelerated trade comparison. Moreover, this is not a matterof first impression. NASDAQ, Inc., with Commission approval, has been usingits automated Trade Acceptance and Resolution System (``TARS'') since 1986.TARS, like the NYSE's On-Line Correction System, is an electronic facilitythat permits subscribers, using terminal screens, to resolve uncomparedtrades. <T3>See </T3>NASD Market Services, Inc., <T3>Trade Acceptance and Reconciliation Service User Guide </T3>(May 20,1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Amex has agreed to submit monthly reports to the Commissionconcerning the operations of Amex Rule 719. Also, Amex has agreed to providewritten notice to the Commission upon the implementation of an automatedtrade correction system.

Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposedrule change is consistent with the Act, particularly sections 6(b)(5) and17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. <T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b) of the Actthat the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-89-05)be, and hereby is, approved on a temporary basis.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
