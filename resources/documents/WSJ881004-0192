He described the talks so far as &quot;very preliminary.&quot;    The official refused to disclose what types of cooperation are being proposed, except to say the consultations are touching on potential technology-sharing and technology-production agreements. He rejected published reports that Sanyo is on the verge of agreeing to certain technology transfers that would enable Samsung to produce and export copiers and facsimile machines to Japan's domestic market. </TEXT></DOC>
