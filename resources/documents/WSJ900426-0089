Budget analysts have estimated that as much as $28 billionin capital could be needed by the RTC in the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1, and the Congressional Budget Office hascounted this borrowing as part of its projections for thefiscal 1991 deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed amendment, which was approved by the SenateAppropriations Committee without public discussion Tuesdaynight, would sidestep the problem by changing Gramm-Rudman'sscore-keeping conventions to exclude the ebb and flow of RTCworking capital from calculations of the budget shortage. TheRTC, created by last year's big thrift-industry law, needsworking capital to manage the assets of failed savings andloans before they are sold or merged.   Politically, the change would help the White House andCongress past an election-year headache. But the change isdefended too as a serious attempt to avoid what could be ascoring nightmare beyond fiscal 1991, when revenues willpresumably begin returning to the government as assets aresold and the White House Office of Management and Budgetwould have immense leverage in saying how much the deficitcould be reduced.   As attached to the spending bill, the measure is subjectto parliamentary challenge on the floor, but the Bushadministration and the Congressional Budget Office apparentlyhave joined with the bipartisan Senate budget leadership inbacking the move.   Within the current fiscal year, the underlying billprovides for nearly $3.3 billion in new spending, which wouldbe largely offset by $2.86 billion in reductions or transfersfrom various defense accounts.   The administration's top priority has been securingincreased aid for Central America, but as the bill has movedthrough Congress, the measure has grown to where nearlythree-quarters of the new spending would go to a variety ofdomestic accounts. Among these is $185 million for a newfingerprint-identification facility for the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, expected now to be located in West Virginia,the home state of Appropriations Committee Chairman RobertByrd.</TEXT></DOC>
