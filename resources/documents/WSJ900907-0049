The quickened pace of discussions yesterday was the firstsign in months that the negotiators were serious aboutdevising a significant budget plan. Another indication willcome today, when President Bush opens the latest round oftalks at Andrews Air Force Base near here.</LP><TEXT>   In separate press conferences yesterday, the negotiatorsof both parties said they would act in good faith to reachagreement. Both also reiterated their support for thepreviously agreed to goal of cutting the deficit by $50billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and $500 billionover five years, even though the economy has weakened furtherand the Persian Gulf crisis has spurred energy prices sincethey last met a month ago.   Despite the promises of $50 billion packages, however,both sides indicated that any final plan probably would fallshort of that. &quot;It's a negotiating position and we're notgoing to die for any part of it,&quot; Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,Minn.) said of the GOP plan. &quot;We'll see where we go fromthere.&quot;   Both sides labored throughout the day to complete theirplans, amid continuing divisions within party ranks. Thoughlawmakers and aides gave few details, both the Democratic andRepublican plans appeared likely to be split about evenlybetween spending cuts and tax increases.   Late yesterday, congressional Republicans endorsed astheir opening shot a $53 billion fiscal 1991 plan that waslittle changed from a proposal prepared by White House BudgetDirector Richard Darman in July. Roughly half of the proposedsavings would come from higher revenues and user fees, about$15 billion from cuts in entitlement programs, notablyMedicare, and a net of about $4 billion from other domesticprograms.   Both sides appear to support some kind of increases on&quot;sin&quot; taxes. Democrats were talking about raising excisetaxes on liquor and tobacco, while Republicans will proposehigher taxes on beer and wine only. By omitting tobacco, theGOP reflected a recent campaign pledge by President Bush inNorth Carolina.   In addition, Democrats were moving toward proposing abroad tax on energy consumption and adopting their long-heldposition to lift the top tax rate on the richest Americans to33% from 28%.   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) indicatedRepublicans were considering tax incentives for oilproduction, a move that would lose revenue. At least someDemocrats also were suggesting a fee on imported oil as a wayof helping domestic production.   The Republican plan also will apparently propose to expandtax breaks for individual retirement accounts and limit thededuction for state and local income tax payments. It alsowill propose cutting the capital-gains tax rate, which wouldboost revenue in the first year. The Democrats don't intendto support the capital gains tax, at least initially.   For defense spending, Republicans will propose about $5billion in cuts, while Democrats, at least initially,supported cuts of more than twice that size. Still inquestion was the accounting for the costs of stationing U.S.troops in Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Darman has estimated at $3billion over the next six months.   Given the Mideast crisis, Republicans feel confident thatdefense cuts won't be so great as Democrats would like. Butin turn, Democrats would demand fewer domestic cuts thanRepublicans. Since both sides have tentatively agreed tobalance spending cuts and tax increases, any erosion inspending cuts would reduce proposed new revenues. The resultcould be a deficit-trimming package as small as $25 billion.   Serious questions remain whether any package will emergefrom the weekend meetings, and yesterday's news conferencesseemed designed in part for each side to try to establish itsown good faith should talks collapse.   &quot;We can't guarantee for you that something's going tohappen,&quot; said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.), who chairs the bipartisan negotiations. But, he added,the across-the-board spending cuts that threaten after Oct. 1if Congress and the Bush administration don't reach agreement&quot;would be a very bad and poor outcome.&quot;   One negotiator, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R.,Ga.), said the greater pressure for a solution was onDemocrats, who control Congress. &quot;How would you like thepresident to announce that he's able to work with Mubarak,he's able to work with Gorbachev, he's able to work with all22 of our allies in the Persian Gulf, but the Congress andSaddam Hussein are the two groups he doesn't seem to be ableto work with?&quot; Mr. Gingrich asked.   The difficulties ahead for negotiators were underscoredwhen Mr. Gingrich used a luncheon speech to restate hisintention to push a package of tax cuts. Though he put therevenue loss at $18 billion over five years, other estimatesput a cost at $85 billion over that period.   Mr. Gingrich reiterated his criticism of congressionalDemocrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, and his opposition to tax increases. Mr. Mitchelldismissed the remarks. Alluding to the president'sacknowledgement that revenue increases will be necessary, theSenate leader said &quot;President Bush has one view and Rep.Gingrich appears to have another.&quot;   Campaigning in Topeka, Kan., for Republican candidatesyesterday, President Bush avoided the Democrat-bashing thatmarked campaign appearances earlier this summer. &quot;The timefor partisanship, in my view, is past, and the time foravoiding the tough decisions is gone,&quot; Mr. Bush said.Referring to congressional leaders of both parties, he added,&quot;They're not going to do it {reduce the deficit} exactly theway I want, and I understand that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
