Some people think the major securities firms should swallow their own medicine.    In the past year, the firms' shares have been a disaster. While the Sandamp;P 500 has gained about 20% since several brokerage stocks peaked last April, Salomon has lost 40%. First Boston has fallen 25% and Morgan Stanley, about 10%. Only takeover speculation has sustained Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton shares, money managers say.    &quot;The whole industry is just way behind the market,&quot; says David Dreman of Dreman Value Management, even though many securities firms are very profitable. The stocks' future doesn't look bright either.    Insider trading scandals, bad news and rumors keep driving the stocks down. Salomon hit a 12-month low of 36 yesterday, after selling off on rumors that the firm recently took big bond-trading losses. Merrill fell 3/4 to 40 5/8 yesterday, although it reported that first-quarter profit rose to $1 from 85 cents a share.    If the stocks keep falling, some firms might be more vulnerable to a takeover. Others might be forced by restive shareholders to restructure, money managers say. They don't see how else they'll make money on their shares; some analysts predict flat or lower 1987 profit for the industry.    Securities firms aren't ideal restructuring candidates. They're highly leveraged and have little excess cash to buy back stock. Salomon, most notably, has been spending heavily on overseas and U.S. expansion.    But most securities firms have assets that aren't reflected in their stock prices and might be sold or spun off. Salomon has commodities-trading and refining businesses. First Boston has real estate, equity stakes in companies and a European jointventure, Credit Suisse First Boston.    Merrill, Hutton, and Morgan have big money management units. Merrill, partly because of shareholder pressure in 1986, started the ball rolling. It will soon sell the public a stake in its real estate operations.    Money managers say publicly traded securities firms might also help their stocks by taking in foreign partners. Shearson Lehman Brothers -- soon to go public again -- has agreed to sell a 13% stake to Japan's Nippon Life Insurance at three times its 1986 book value. Salomon trades at half that valuation, or about 1.5 times book, although it's a leader in many securities businesses.    John Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman, says such a steep discount in a stock &quot;doesn't usually last&quot; more than a few months. While &quot;I never say never,&quot; Salomon has &quot;no present intention&quot; of spinning off assets or taking in another foreign partner. Minerals andamp; Resources Corp., controlled by South Africa's Harry Oppenheimer, currently owns about 13% of Salomon.    Some portfolio managers say Salomon's problem is pressing. Much of management's wealth is in Salomon stock options. A low stock price is embarrassing and makes it harder to issue new equity. &quot;I'm sure they're working to do&quot; something about the stock, says Jay Pearlstein of Loomis Sayles.    Disappointing fourth-quarter profit, defections and other problems have battered Salomon shares, sparking rumors it might even go private. Robert Salomon, a managing director, says that's &quot;idle speculation.&quot; Salomon hasn't lost money trading, he adds, although traders say it took about a $30 million hit in late March on seven-year Treasury notes and maybe lost more money last week when bonds tumbled.    Even better-than-expected first-quarter profit might not help Salomon's stock much. People are disenchanted with brokerage shares, says Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Securities.    If Salomon could sell a 13% stake to a Japanese investor at three times book, it would get $1.3 billion. While the firm isn't short of capital, the alliance might help its Tokyo business and support its stock, money managers say.    Salomon's commodity units probably aren't worth even $300 million, or $2 a share, analysts say. But a spinoff might be popular, because commodity markets are back in favor.    First Boston's hidden assets are worth a lot, says Mr. Dreman. In 1986, it sold one of its New York office buildings at a big premium. Its stake in Credit Suisse First Boston, on the books at about $175 million, or at $5 a share, might be worth $10 a share if a part were taken public, says Sam Liss, a Salomon analyst -- although he doubts it will be. First Boston won't comment.    As for money management, John Keefe, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst, values Hutton's and Morgan's actively managed assets at about $12 a share each.    Nobody thinks securities firms are eager to sell a stake in their assets. But if their stocks tumble in a bull market, they're unlikely to fare well when the boom ends. In 1981, when brokerage stocks were very cheap, several firms were acquired, including Salomon by Phibro.    Institutional concerns now seem unlikely takeover targets. Salomon might cost $7 billion or more. Credit Suisse owns a big chunk of First Boston. Morgan is 80%-owned by insiders.    But if the stocks fall too far, the companies might come under heavy shareholder pressure. Giant Salomon might even attract a takeover offer, speculates a portfolio manager. &quot;They have to close the gap between the stock&quot; and its real value. </TEXT></DOC>
