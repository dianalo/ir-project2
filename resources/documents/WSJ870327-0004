Proposes to Pay $7.4 BillionFor the 45% of Standard Oil It Doesn't Already Own---Tender Offer, if Successful,Would Clear the WayFor Expansion in U.S.---By Gary Putka and Ralph E. WinterStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BP SRD EUROPTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)PETROLEUM (PET)BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   British Petroleum Co. said it intends to offer $7.4 billion for the 45% of Standard Oil Co. that it doesn't already own, in a move that paves the way for further U.S. expansion by the British company.    BP said it would pay $70 for each of the approximately 105.8 million shares of Standard Oil held by minority holders in a tender offer beginning Wednesday. The bid is the biggest ever by a British company and the largest tender offer in the U.S. since Chevron Corp.'s $13.23 billion acquisition of Gulf Corp. in 1984.    In Cleveland, Standard Oil issued a one-paragraph news release saying that a special committee of the Standard board set up last year to monitor the relationship between Standard and BP is studying the proposed offer. The committee has retained First Boston Corp. as its financial adviser.    Standard representatives refused to comment beyond the news release, and company executives didn't return telephone calls.    If it succeeds, the BP offer would make the company the world's third-largest oil company, behind only Exxon Corp. and Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Consolidated revenue of BP and Standard last year totaled the equivalent of $43.68 billion; Standard's revenue was $10.02 billion.    BP's announcement instantly rekindled bid fever on Wall Street, recently under a cloud from the government's big takeover-trading investigation. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Standard Oil's shares surged $6.50, to $71.375 on volume of 5.5 million shares. The premium over BP's proposed price suggested purchases by merger-speculating risk arbitragers who bet that BP would raise its bid. Other oil companies previously rumored as takeover targets also rose in heavy trading. These included Atlantic Richfield Co., which jumped $3, to $80.375. BP American depositary receipts advanced $2, to $59.375; ADRs represent ownership of shares that are physically deposited abroad.    At a London news conference yesterday, BP's chairman, Sir Peter Walters, said the company wanted to eliminate the minority holding to make expansion easier in the U.S., which he called &quot;an important focal point of our future strategy.&quot; In the past, Sir Peter added, BP has been hampered by a cumbersome dual-board structure and potential competitive conflicts with Standard Oil in mapping out U.S. opportunities.    In New York, David Simon, managing director of BP, who functions as its chief financial officer, said a combination of the two companies &quot;clears the ground for&quot; possible major acquisitions in the U.S., either of oil reserves or downstream operations. &quot;It creates a very, very effective base from which to expand the business within the U.S.,&quot; he said, and it would be BP's intention to expand U.S. operations.    BP said that it wouldn't change Standard Oil's current management and that it would run its entire North American operation from Cleveland, where Standard Oil now is based.    Major U.S. acquisitions by BP could prevent a decline in the company's reserves and production in the next few years. Production in the North Sea, BP's main non-U.S. asset, already is dropping. And the flow from Standard Oil's rich Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska is expected to begin falling sometime in the next two to three years.    &quot;Much of what BP can do, we feel it can do in the U.S.,&quot; Sir Peter said. But in the past, he added, &quot;we were either missing tricks because our joint overheads were too high, or we were pursuing different paths.&quot;    Sir Peter said he went to the U.S. and met with Standard's six nonexecutive directors that don't have BP ties March 9. He said he informed them that BP was considering making an offer &quot;to give them some time to think about it.&quot; No price was discussed, the BP chairman said. Sir Peter similarly canvassed Standard Oil's board last year in advance of replacing the company's top management.    A Standard Oil source said Sir Peter also informed top Standard executives March 9 that an offer was in the works. However, Standard executives didn't know the proposed price until early yesterday, the source said.    The BP offer came only eight days after the British government announced plans to sell its remaining 32% stake in BP, currently valued at the equivalent of $8.51 billion, by March 31, 1988. Sir Peter said yesterday that the government knew of BP's impending offer for the rest of Standard before making its announcement. But the close timing of the two events was coincidental, the BP chairman insisted.    British stockbrokers, however, said BP may have hurried its Standard Oil bid to improve prospects for the government's sale, especially in the U.S., where many of the BP shares will be offered. John Thompson, an analyst with County Securities in London, said BP &quot;wants to avoid confusing&quot; U.S. investors with two major decisions involving BP at once. The company also wants to familiarize American investors with BP before the government sale, the analyst said.    BP will fund about one-third of the cost of the stock purchase from its own cash, said Mr. Simon. Another third will be financed with commercial paper, he said, and the remaining third from bank borrowings. The company has $5 billion of four-year bank credit lines, Mr. Simon said.    &quot;We would intend to (repay the bank loans) from the joint cash flow of the combined companies,&quot; Mr. Simon said. &quot;We're looking to get the balance sheet back in shape as soon as possible.&quot; He said there were no plans to sell Standard assets that hadn't already been targeted for divestiture by Standard's management.    Mr. Simon said BP's debt-to-equity ratio would &quot;blow up,&quot; but quickly added, &quot;We will have that under control in a very short time.&quot; Asked to elaborate, Rodney Chase, BP group treasurer, said in New York that BP's debt to total capital would increase to about 44% from 33% currently as a result of the transaction, and would stay that way for about three to four months. But within 12 months, he added, &quot;We will be back down into the (high) 30s.&quot; He explained that, as a hedge against falling oil prices, for two years BP's operating companies have been building up liquidity. He said this cash would be drawn in -- especially from European units -- and would be used to acquire the Standard stock.    BP's bid only completes its efforts to run the company that practically started the American oil industry but spent billions in profitless exploration and mining expansion in recent years. Upset with that investment record, BP ousted Standard Oil's independent management a year ago and installed its own man, Robert B. Horton, as chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Horton has slashed expenditures and non-oil activities and generally tightened operations.    But Standard Oil's half-interest in Prudhoe Bay remains a prized asset. Standard's share of production, 680,700 barrels a day last year, was about 10% of total U.S. oil production.    The BP bid &quot;is an affirmation of the highly positive outlook for the oil industry, especially for politically secure crude oil,&quot; said Sanford L. Margoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;They, like the rest of us, have a growing awareness that oil is finite, and that it costs more to get it.&quot;    Until recently, both BP and Standard management had been relatively pessimistic about oil prices. Sir Peter and Mr. Horton now say they expect oil's price to remain stable at about $18 a barrel, largely because of the new determination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb production. At his news conference, Sir Peter said BP priced its offer by assuming an inflation-adjusted, $18 price through the end of the century. A year ago, both BP and Standard were using a price of $15 a barrel for planning purposes, Mr. Simon said.    Sir Peter also said that BP considered buying out the Standard Oil minority stake at the time it installed Mr. Horton in March 1986. &quot;It would have been rather different then because we would have been landing a bid on a rather hostile management,&quot; Sir Peter said. &quot;It would have had a demoralizing effect.&quot;    BP also was dissuaded from buying the stake when oil prices began to plummet. Sir Peter was asked whether it wouldn't have been smarter to buy the stake then, when Standard Oil's shares were trading about 30% less than they are now. The BP chairman replied, &quot;I wouldn't have slept too well in that case last June, July and August,&quot; while oil prices were sliding.    Mr. Horton in a recent interview emphasized the significance of the decline in U.S. oil production, and said there is no likelihood that the trend will be reversed. BP apparently assumes that decline makes Standard's reserves all the more valuable.    BP reported production outside Standard Oil last year of 718,000 barrels a day, up slightly from 1985. Mr. Thompson, of County, said BP has told analysts that production will fall to 620,000 barrels a day by 1990. Last year, production from BP's main Forties Field in the North Sea fell to 294,000 barrels a day from 327,000 in 1985. Mr. Thompson and other London analysts expect sharper drops in North Sea production in the future.    Jack N. Aydin, an oil analyst with McDonald andamp; Co., Cleveland, believes BP's timing is well chosen. &quot;They get a double benefit right now. Crude oil is cheap and the dollar is weak,&quot; he said. &quot;They are probably buying very cheap reserves. If I had the money (in pounds), I would buy it too.&quot;    But Mr. Thompson, the London analyst, disagreed, saying, &quot;In general terms, the bid is uninspiring.&quot; He said BP is increasing its dependence on Prudhoe Bay, and isn't diversifying its assets. &quot;What this company really needed was an expanding production, not production which is in decline,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. BP has had its own exploration disappointments during the 1980s in offshore China and Brazil, he noted.    Analysts also were split on whether BP's proposed price represented a bargain for the company. Mr. Aydin values Standard Oil's breakup value at about $75 to $80 a share. But John S. Herold andamp; Co., the U.S. oil research firm, figures it at no more than $45.30 a share.    Alan Gaines, a New York money manager who specializes in oil shares, said U.S. companies that are comparable to Standard, such as Amerada Hess Corp., are trading at discounts to their breakup value and lower multiples of their cash flow. &quot;I'd take the $70 (a share) and run to the bank,&quot; Mr. Gaines said.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed long-term debt and commercial-paper ratings of both BP and Standard under review for possible downgrade as a result of the proposed tender offer. About $3.5 billion of BP debt and $3.8 billion of Standard debt are affected. The rating concern said the purchase would &quot;seriously impact BP's liquidity, leverage and interest coverage.&quot;    ---   Bill Paul contributed to this article.    ---          Ten Years of Major Oil Acquisitions    Excludes transactions valued at less than $3.5 billion                                                 VALUE                                             (In billions YEAR        TRANSACTION                      of dollars) 1977        Getty acquires Skelly                $3.57 1979        Shell acquires Belridge               3.65 1981        Du Pont acquires Conoco               7.80 1982        Occidental acquires              Cities Service                       4.09 1982        U.S. Steel (USX)             acquires Marathon                     5.93 1984        Mobil acquires Superior               5.70 1984        Texaco acquires Getty                10.13 1984        California Standard             (Chevron) acquires Gulf              13.23 1985        Royal Dutch/Shell acquires             remainder of 64.9%-owned             Shell Oil                             5.67 1987        BP tender offer for             remaining shares of 55%-             owned Standard Oil                    7.40</TEXT></DOC>
