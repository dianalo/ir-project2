Alcohol-related highway deaths seem to be declining slightly,the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. Butstatistics show a higher rate of highway deaths _ and a higher rateof drunken-driving wrecks _ during the year-end holiday period.   ``This is not to say don't travel,'' said Dr. Terence L. Chorba,a CDC researcher. ``This is to say don't travel drunk, particularlyif you're the one behind the wheel.''   The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration projectsthat 1,770 highway deaths and 48,000 injuries will occur on theroads over the Hanukkah-Christmas-New Year's holiday travel season,which began Thursday and extends to Jan. 2.   Statisticians at the National Safety Council in Chicago came upwith a lower projection of as many as 770 lives deaths over thelong Christmas and New Year's weekends. The estimate was based ondata compiled during the holidays in previous years, seasonalweather factors and national driving safety trends.   The worst day of the season is expected to be Saturday, when thehighway administration predicts 235 traffic deaths. Friday issecond, with 197, followed by Sunday _ Christmas Eve _ with 176 andNew Year's Day with 165.   ``Over the holidays we see more ... miles traveled, and you havean increase in the number of fatalities _ but you also have anincrease in the number involving drunk driving,'' Chorba said.   Last year, 50 percent of the deaths on Christmas involveddrunken driving, compared to 39 percent on non-holiday days. Forthe day of New Year's Eve, it was 36 percent, but for New Year'sDay, including the hours after midnight, it was 58 percent.   In 1988 overall, 47,093 deaths were reported in U.S.motor-vehicle crashes; 18,503, or 39 percent, involved drunkendriving _ someone with a blood-alcohol count of 0.10 or more,legally drunk in most states.   That percentage is down somewhat from 1987, when 18,529 drunkendriving crashes were reported, 40 percent of the 46,386 trafficdeaths. The figure was 46 percent in 1982.   Chorba noted, however, that fully half of the fatal crashesstill involve someone who has been drinking, even if the person isnot legally drunk.   ``Fifty percent of the fatalities on the roads have some alcoholcomponent to them, whether it's a driver or a bicyclist or apedestrian,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
