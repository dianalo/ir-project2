Manyscientists believe that the buildup of these gasses threatensto cause a disastrous warming of the Earth's climate. TheU.S. is the only major industrial nation that hasn't pledgedsuch a step, which is a major impediment to agreement on atreaty.   The money will go to the core fund of the GlobalEnvironmental Facility, which will be affiliated with theWorld Bank.
