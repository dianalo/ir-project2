Telephone Co has agreed to reveal information on the use of itsservices to enhance competition in the telecommunications market: up to now,NTT has treated key traffic information on the use of telephones and othertelecommunications systems, such as the number of calls that are made betweeneach administrative district and the revenues it derives from each districtas a closely-guarded corporate secret; it now says details such as the numberof subscribers in each district, the number and volume of calls from eachdistrict, an hourly breakdown of use in each district and traffic betweenprefectures will be released by June.andM;n i pandM;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co has developed an educational operatingsystem based on the B-TRON specifications and featuring animation on thepersonal computer screen: the hardware consists of MNatsushita's 16-bit M500micro, a video cassette recorder, and a video processor which links theanimation signals from an optical disk to the screen, keyboard and display:the video signal is processed at the operating system level and output to thescreen when required as animation; the operating system is designed tosupport Japanese language processing and Matsushita plans to market thesystem in due course - not surprisingly mainly to educational institutions.andM;p o nandM;Mitsubishi Electric Corp has begun to develop a machine using RISC technology- but hasn't yet decided which processor to use: currently still at thespecification stage, the machine is being developed with a view to reachingmarket within three years, but on the software front it will definitelysupport Unix System V.3 or higher, and Berkeley 4.2 BSD extensions; thecompany is expected to opt for either the Sun Microsystems Sparc or the MIPSComputer Systems Inc R series because the Motorola Inc 88000 and the IntelCorp 80486 are seen as still relatively immature.andM;n i pandM;The Japan Communications Satellite Co joint venture between the C Itoh andamp; Coand Mitsui andamp; Co trading houses will start satellite commun-ications servicesin early April following the launch of its commercial satellite by theEuropean Ariane rocket on March 1: the company has sold a total of 22transponders, of which 14 will be available for use at the start of services;the Mitsubishi group company Space Communications Corp will also startservices at the end of May following launch of its satellite, due at end ofApril.andM;p o nandM;Sony Corp has Hangulised its News Berkeley Unix workstation and will sell itinto the South Korean market through the major electronics manufacturerDaewoo Electronics: since last July when Sony appointed Daewoo as itsdistributor, the two have been working together on conversion of theoperating system to handle Hangul or Korean script, and Sony looks to ship1,000 in Korea this year; Sun Microsystems is there - but without Hangul.andM;Telecomet International, formed in Tokyo in 1984 as a joint venture betweenKokusai Denshin Denwa Co, Japan Airlines and Telecomet Japan, has developedand begun marketing an information and analysis system that providesreal-time share and bond price data, data from the international futuresmarket of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and bond dealing information from JapanSogo Securities: the $120,000 system can be operated from one keyboard -using hardware developed by Telecomet - and can provide various analyses suchas spread of bond futures and predicted return, plus charting on the basis ofreal-time data: Telecomet has been the distributor for Control Data'sMicrognosys and its Trade system, selling it around 30 financialinstitutions.andM;n i pandM;Despite saying in the US that it would be looking for sales primarily toJapan's Ministery of Defence, ATandamp;T Co and its partner Sumitomo Corp are verydefinitely saying that they are going after civil markets as well with theAN/UYS-2 supercomputer: Sumitomo says it hopes to sell 150 of the things tothe automobile, shipbuilding and construction, industries for design andscientific processing applications over five years; there are currently onlyabout 100 supercomputers installed in Japan, from the likes of Fujitsu Ltd,Hitachi Ltd and NEC Corp, plus Cray Research Inc and ETA Systems, but thepricing on the ATandamp;T machine, starting at $2m or aobut a third the price ofdomestic machines, leads observers to forecast big business for it.andM;p o nandM;Sharp Corp is expected to come out with a lap-top personal computer with acolour liquid crystal diode display this year: the machine will be to the AXstandard, which means an AT-compatible 80286- or 80386-based processor, withJapanese language processing support: Seiko Epson Co has already announcedthat it will have a colour laptop next year, so a proliferation seems to beon the way.andM;n i pandM;The three main shareholders in International Digital Communications - Cable andamp;Wireless Plc, C Itoh andamp; Co and Toyota Motor Corp - are to meet in the nearfuture to decide on the fate of their fourth prospective member PacificTelesis International Inc, whose attempt to join the new group has beenstymied by the US Justice Department in the same way that Nynex Corp'sinvolvement in the PTAT-1 transatlantic cable is on hold: the periodoriginally granted to the San Francisco phone company to ratify itscommitment ran out at the end of December, and the other three have to decidewhether to try and find another US partner or grant PacTel a furtherextension.andM;p o nandM;Fujitsu Ltd says it has developed a programmable read-only memory incombination BiCMOS technology with a racey 25nS access time, and has begunsampling the part as the MB71C44, with volume promised for the spring at aninitial 30,000 per month: the key selling point is that power consumption isjust 315mW, a third of that for comparable bi-polar PROMs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
