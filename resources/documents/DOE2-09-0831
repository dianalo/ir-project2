The report presentsthe results of investigations into the long-term performance of water-heatingheat pumps (WHHPs) and their potential contribution towards the savingof energy. The investigations included an analysis of typical heat-pumpsystems, long-term monitoring of two heat-pump installations, the developmentof a performance model, simulation of performance in different regionsof South Africa, as well as case studies of two industrial systems. Economicfactors affecting the application of heat pumps are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
