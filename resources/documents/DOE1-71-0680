After reviewing thetechnical accomplishments of the Office, the report describes some ofthe barriers that inhibit commercialization of these accomplishments.Primary, secondary, and spin-off audiences for OTS R and D are then characterized.An inventory of recent OTS technology transfer activities follows andis supplemented by nine detailed case studies of technology transfer.These case studies represent five distinct approaches to technology transferand a wide array of mechanisms including: contracting to industry, licensing,demonstration projects, user facilities, and financial incentives. Thereport ends with a list of recommended future technology transfer activities.</TEXT></DOC>
