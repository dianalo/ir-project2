Shamir, in a speech in Jerusalem, said, ``There is no reason forIsrael to surrender and accept the intefadeh (uprising) asvictorious and the PLO as landlord over part of the land of Israel.   ``What has been proposed to us today is to go to Cairo to talkto the intefadeh leaders and the heads of the PLO about theshortest path toward a Palestinian state,'' Shamir added.   It was one of Shamir's harshest criticisms of Egypt's 10-pointpeace plan, which has caused tension in Israel's coalition Cabinetbetween Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning LaborParty after Labor accepted it in principle.   Labor head and Finance Minister Shimon Peres said Tuesday hisparty ``thinks we now have a most important chance for advancingthe peace process. ... We should not miss this opportunity justbecause some people think party considerations prevail over thoseof state.''   Meanwhile, Ehud Olmert, the Cabinet minister responsible forArab affairs, said Tuesday that Israel should consider imposing thedeath penalty for security offenses in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip.   Olmert told reporters in Jerusalem that he believed thePalestinian uprising was continuing because ``the punishmentsapplied until now are not deterrent enough ... and therefore maybewe should consider perhaps somewhat harsher punishment.''   Asked what he would recommend, he said, ``Capital punishment.''   Olmert also described Israeli prisons as ``too comfortable'' andsaid ``hard labor might be one of the harsher conditions thatshould be considered.''   Also Tuesday, the body of a 30-year-old Palestinian was found inthe West Bank town of Nablus a day after he was kidnapped by maskedArab youths, Palestinian reporters said.   They said Hani Emil Salfiti, an ambulance driver, was apparentlystrangled after being accused of being an informer for the Shin Betsecret service, reporters said.   The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating.   Salfiti's death raised to 121 the number of Palestinians killedby fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators with Israel since thestart of the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip.   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 574 Palestinians inthe revolt, and 40 Israelis have died in the violence.   Meanwhile, four Arabs were reported shot and wounded Tuesday instone-throwing clashes with troops in Gaza, Arab hospitals reported.   The army had no immediate reports of casualties in Gaza.   A district court in the southern town of Beersheva on Tuesdaysentenced Shimon Efrakh, a Jewish settler from Neve Dekalim inGaza, to seven months in suspended sentence for shooting to deathan Arab girl.   Intissar Atar, 17, was killed on Nov. 10, 1987 by an accidentalshot from Efrakh's pistol fired after Palestinian girls in the GazaStrip stoned a car in which Efrakh and other settlers traveled,Israel radio said.   The verdict pointed out that Efrakh had no intention of causingdeath and that ``regular criminal punishment considerations couldnot apply in this case.''   The court also sentenced 22-year-old Ezad Mahmud Shabban of Gazato life in prison Tuesday for the Aug. 4 slayings of two fellowPalestinian prisoners for allegedly collaborating with Israel.   The Egyptian initiative advocates trading occupied territory forpeace and calls for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.The Palestinian delegation would include two Arabs deported byIsrael to represent Palestinians in the diaspora.   The United States has welcomed Egypt's initiative, designed tosidestep Israeli objections to PLO participation in the talks.Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist organization.   Shamir has rejected any modification of Israel's own initiative,which calls for Palestinian elections to select representatives fortalks on limited autonomy.   Shamir's aide Avi Pazner denied that Shamir's rejection of theproposed Cairo meeting contradicted earlier statements that he waswilling to meet with Palestinians to arrange elections.   ``The prime minister has no problem meeting Palestinians,''Pazner said. ``The issue is that Egypt's initiative wants us tomeet with PLO people.''   The Polish-born Shamir, whose family died in the Holocaust,compared suggestions that Israel talk with the PLO to Europe'sattempted appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.   ``They made great efforts to prevent a war with Germany and itsNazi leadership,'' said Shamir. ``But the results were far worsethen the First World War. It seems that to us the lesson is clear.''</TEXT></DOC>
