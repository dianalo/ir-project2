The OTA said the current stable of space shuttles and expendable rockets is adequate to launch the space station and routine communications and weather satellites for the military. But to do much more, such as testing or deploying space-based missile defense systems or launching manned missions to Mars, expensive new vehicles are necessary, according to the OTA, an arm of Congress that evaluates science and technology questions.    The report, called a &quot;Buyer's Guide,&quot; is designed to help lawmakers evaluate which launch vehicles are necessary to fulfill different space missions.    Space activity in the U.S. is at a watershed. Both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force have embarked on ambitious new space-based missions, for which spending is expected to climb substantially over the next few decades. But Congress has yet to decide whether to continue funding such programs as Star Wars and the space station.    Richard DalBello, who directed the report, said the OTA's message to Congress is: &quot;Don't pick your vehicle first, pick your goals in space.&quot;    But the thrust of the report supports the development of new launch systems. For instance, it estimates that a new shuttle cargo system could pay for itself in seven launches because it could carry much more cargo than the current shuttle. However, the cost-savings estimates came from NASA, which has repeatedly underestimated shuttle development costs.    If Congress and the next president decide to continue testing and later deploy a vast Star Wars system, OTA recommends building one of two new Air Force unmanned vehicles. One, called the advanced launch system, is a huge booster designed to slash the cost of launching cargo into space early in the next century. The other, called the transition vehicle, would use current technology and could be deployed in about seven years.    The Air Force has proposed building both vehicles, but Congress has blocked funds for the transition vehicle, fearing it might lead to early deployment of Star Wars.    For NASA's pet project, a manned mission to Mars, the OTA report concludes that the U.S. might have to build a shuttle-cargo system, plus the advanced launch system and, perhaps, one of two manned space ships. One is a new space shuttle; the other is the so-called national aerospace plane, which would use air-breathing jets instead of rockets to reach orbit.    None of these options come cheap. Simply improving and flying the current shuttle and expendable rockets, the OTA estimated, would cost about $150 billion, in 1988 dollars, over 21 years. </TEXT></DOC>
