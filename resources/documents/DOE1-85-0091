The concentrationsof radioactive cesium and other gamma-emitting nuclides were determinedon meat of moose and other cervids and also on small game in variousparts of the country before or in the beginning of the hunting season.The most important radionuclides found in the samples were {sup 134}Csand {sup 137}Cs. In addition to these, {sup 131}I was detected in thefirst moose meat samples in the spring. None of them was significantas far as the dietary intake of radionuclides is concerned. The transferof fallout radiocesium to game meat was most efficient in the case ofthe arctic hare and inland waterfowl; terrestrial game birds and thebrown hare belonged to the same category as moose. In 1986 the mean dietaryintake via game meat was for {sup 131}Cs 47 Bq per person and for {sup137}Cs 106 Bq per person. In 1987 the corresponding values were 69 Bqper person for {sup 134}Cs and 180 Bq per person for {sup 137}Cs. Thecontribution of cervids to the total dietary intake of radiocesium viagame meat was 3/4, which was slightly less than their contribution tothe annual game bag. On the basis of the preliminary results of thisstudy it was concluded in autumn 1986 that there was no need to restricthunting in the year 1986/1987. The radiocesium found in the meat of terrestrialgame animals did not necessitate any recommendations on their use. Asregards the meat of waterfowl caught in the main inland fallout area,it was recommended not to eat more than 20 kg per person.</TEXT></DOC>
