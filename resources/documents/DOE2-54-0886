In yearswith global dust storms, dust is raised in the Southern Hemisphere andspread over much of the planet by an intensified Hadley circulation.In years without global dust storms, dust is raised in the Northern Hemisphereby relatively active midlatitude storm systems, but does not spread globally.In both cases the dusty season is winter in the north. It is shown fromnumerical simulations that a Northern Hemisphere dust haze weakens theintensity of the cross equatorial Hadley circulation and the contributionit makes to the surface stress in the Southern Hemisphere. This, in turn,reduces the possibility of global dust storm development. The interannualvariability is the result either of a competition between circulationin opposite hemispheres, in which case the variability has a random component;or it is the result of the cycling of dust between hemispheres, in whichcase the variability is related to the characteristics of global duststorms themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
