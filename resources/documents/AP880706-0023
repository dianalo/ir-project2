Several congressional leaders, including House Speaker JimWright, have suggested that families of the 290 victims of Sunday'sattack be offered compensation as a gesture of conciliation andregret by the United States.   ``It is a matter that has to be discussed,'' Reagan saidTuesday. ``I'm waiting for the results of the investigation.''   A team of Navy investigators arrived in the Gulf region to siftthrough information, and is expected to issue a report in two tothree weeks, including the extent of ``potential claims.''   Legal offices at the State Department, the Pentagon and theWhite House have the idea of compensation under activeconsideration, according to sources who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``I think it would be a wise idea,'' said Sen. John Warner,R-Va., the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee. ``There's a clear admission by our president that thiswas an unfortunate accident,'' and Congress likely would providethe money for such payments, he said.   Warner said such an offer, perhaps negotiated through a thirdparty, would demonstrate good faith on the side of the UnitedStates and could help turn a tragic circumstance into somethingthat could bring peace and stability to the volatile region.   ``That's something that deserves consideration,'' said Rep.Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``Any tragedy, accidental or otherwise, deservesconsideration.''   Others on Capitol Hill suggested such talk was premature. Rep.Tom Downey, D-N.Y., said any compensatory payments should beconditioned on the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon bypro-Iranian groups.   One congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said administration officials are recommending that Reagan quicklyoffer compensation. A principal argument for that course of actionis that it would mute comparisons to the destruction of a KoreanAir Lines jet in 1983 by the Soviet Union, which rejected allrequests for reparations for families of the 269 people aboard.   Such a decision by the president would be weighted with foreignpolicy implications and he would want to consult thoroughly withCongress before making any compensation offer, administrationofficials said.   ``You've got a basic policy choice, with a very high profile,''said one administration legal expert, who spoke only on conditionof anonymity.   But according to administration and congressional officials, adecision to offer compensation would by no means ensure that itwould ultimately be received by the families of victims.   Perhaps the most difficult barrier is the lack of diplomaticrelations between the United States and Iran. The only formaldirect contact between the two countries is at a tribunal in TheHague, the Netherlands, where commercial claims from before the1979 Islamic revolution are still being negotiated. Any newcompensation issue would be outside the scope of that tribunal.   Iranians could file a claim in the International Court ofJustice, but the United States has in the past rejected claims ofjurisdiction by the world court. Other communications between thetwo countries now are handled by Switzerland.   In addition, there is no assurance that the Iranian government,which has used the incident as an anti-American rallying point,would agree to accept payments. And if money were sent to victims'relatives through the government, there are no guarantees that itwould be properly distributed, officials said.   There also is the question of legal authority for making thepayments. Under international law, no nation has to compensate fordamages that result from legitimate military operations. But thePentagon does have authority to make payments of up to $100,000 perperson in accidents.   Most recently, the United States denied liability for damages toneutral embassies in Tripoli, Libya, in a 1986 bombing raid. Andsimilar requests were turned down when neutral shipping was struckduring the bombing of Haiphong harbor during the Vietnam war.   But if the damage resulted from a clear mistake, such as themissile attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi warplane last year thatkilled 37 sailors, compensation may be paid. Iraq admitted erroralmost immediately, and negotiations are continuing on the properamount of damages.   The United States has compensated individuals for damage done bytroops on maneuvers in Central America, and is paying owners of afishing boat shot up by mistake in the Persian Gulf.   In another incident, Israel paid reparations to the UnitedStates following what Israel said was a mistaken attack on the USSLiberty in 1967 during the Arab-Israeli war.   In that case, the payment was what lawyers term ``ex gratia'' _made out of professed sympathy, but without admitting fault orliability. That could well be the form of any U.S. payment toIranian families, one official said.</TEXT></DOC>
