Angrist</HL><DATE>06/18/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A9</SO><LP>   All of us, from time to time, think nostalgically aboutreliving at least part of our childhood. But then we rememberour introduction to algebra and &quot;word problems.&quot; If youhaven't quit reading yet, stick with me -- it might beimportant to your financial well-being.   For example, here are a couple of word problems anyonecontemplating retirement ought to learn how to solve. Youestimate that you must accumulate $600,000 of investablefunds by age 65, just seven years from now. How much must youdeposit at the end of each year in an account that pays 8%tax-free to reach that goal?</LP><TEXT>   You also have decided that you do not wish to leave anestate and you believe you will live 13 years after youretire. (That is one actuarial estimate for a 65-year-oldmale.) If you want a monthly income of $7,000 over yourretired lifetime, at what annual rate of return must yournest egg be invested?   Such are the tense relationships between money andinvesting that Michael Thomsett considers ever so gently inhis new book, &quot;The Mathematics of Investing&quot; (John Wiley, 244pages, $29.95). Mr. Thomsett starts by reviewing the basicideas of the time value of money, illustrating them withsimple examples. He then moves on to more complicatedproblems so that within an hour you could easily manage theanswers to the two questions posed above (and if you can't,keep reading).   Two forces are certain to play an important role foranyone considering retirement-taxes and inflation. Mr.Thomsett has a brief chapter on how to include the effects ofthose facts of life on any investment. The material presentedis not detailed, but should encourage you to include them inyour planning. Another chapter gives the math that should beknown by anyone who buys bonds. With the junk-bond market inthe tank many savvy investors now are trying to pick up a fewbonds that bark like Dalmatians.   On the surface, investing in the bond market looks simple.And it is, if you only compute the current yield -- thestated interest rate for the bond divided by its cost.(That's the calculation this newspaper makes in its New Yorkand American bond listings.) But Mr. Thomsett shows how tofigure out approximately a bond's yield-to-maturity thattakes into account if it is purchased at a premium or adiscount to its face value. That approximation should be goodenough for most people who have not been convicted ofshenanigans in the junk-bond market. This book is elementaryand so it won't turn you into a financial wizard, but it willhelp you find answers to some key questions involving money.   ---   But suppose you already understand how to use the simplermathematical relationships that govern money and investing.Then you might be ready for the book by Stephen Brown andMark Kritzman, &quot;Quantitative Methods for Financial Analysis&quot;(Dow Jones-Irwin, 266 pages, $42.50). This is the secondedition of this book and is required reading for candidatesfor chartered financial analyst certification. However, thatdoesn't mean others shouldn't consider owning it.   Besides covering nearly all the techniques described inMr. Thomsett's book, &quot;Methods&quot; goes considerably further. Forexample, it applies mathematical techniques to real estateinvestments, option and futures instruments and assetallocation. It even has a section on &quot;closet indexing&quot; thatcan be cheerfully discussed without embarrassment in mixedcompany. And for those of you who have forgotten what youlearned in Statistics 101 and/or managed to avoidsuccessfully finding out whether your roommate was a standarddeviation, the book has an appendix on the principles ofstatistics.   ---   But suppose you have no interest in learning about themathematics of finance but just want to reduce the amount ofmoney you are going to have to pay back on your mortgage. Foryou Marc Eisenson has written &quot;The Banker's Secret&quot; (VillardBooks, 256 pages, $14.95). He has managed to put his own timeto good use, generating an entire book out of a simpleapplication of time value of money principles. This bookmakes a big deal out of how a homeowner who pays anadditional $25 a month on his mortgage would save more than$34,000 in interest and shorten a 30-year loan by more thanfive years. It includes copious mortgage tables and schedulesto guide you through the calculations required to find yoursavings. A homeowner interested in reducing his totalfinancial outlay on his house might be better off: (1)applying the cost of this book to the principal he owes onhis house, and (2) then learning to solve all kinds of timevalue of money problems by purchasing either of the first twobooks reviewed in this column.   ---   And now for the envelope, please. The way I figure, youmust deposit $67,243 in the account annually to accumulate$600,000 and your nest egg must be invested at 10.3% for youto receive a monthly income of $7,000.   ---   Mr. Angrist writes about the commodities and optionsmarkets for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
