But first they mustsettle some longstanding, emotionally charged issues thathave kept the two nations at arm's length.   That's exactly what South Korean President Roh Tae Woosays he wants to accomplish when he makes his first officialvisit to Japan next week. Specifically, Mr. Roh says hispeople want a clear apology from Emperor Akihito for thebrutality Japan inflicted during its colonial rule of theKorean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The Korean people aren't really sure of the depth of thesincerity on the part of the Japanese,&quot; says Lee Hong Kee, aspecial adviser to Mr. Roh. &quot;To build a future, you have tosever at least some of the old issues.&quot;   But wounds as old and deep as these may take longer toheal. In Japan, the Korean demand for an apology has stirreda political and constitutional debate about the emperor'srole in foreign policy. It shows how uncomfortable Japan isabout confronting its militaristic past.   Leading political figures, such as the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party's secretary-general, Ichiro Ozawa, arguethat it is unconstitutional for the emperor, who is anational symbol, to get involved in political or diplomaticscuffles. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has put himself in thehot seat, maintaining that he, not the emperor, shouldrespond to the Koreans. Yesterday, Mr. Kaifu said he wouldoffer a heartfelt apology on Japan's behalf.   The apology may top the agenda, but government officialson both sides hope to discuss other pressing bilateral issuesduring Mr. Roh's visit, which begins Thursday. The mainpoints are expected to be trade and technology transfer. Tokeep its exports booming, South Korea imports parts and othergoods from Japan. But selling finished products back to theJapanese market isn't easy. In the first quarter, SouthKorea's trade deficit with Japan shot up 27% from a yearearlier, to $1.3 billion. (In the same period, Korea's tradesurplus with the U.S. fell nearly 82%, to $200 million.)   &quot;Japan has to find a way to buy more Korean products,&quot;says Satoru Okuda, a researcher at the Institute ofDeveloping Economies in Tokyo.   On technology transfer, rising labor costs and a strongerwon are forcing the Koreans to continue upgrading theirtechnology if they want to remain competitive. As othercountries have complained, however, Japan isn't eager toshare technology, especially with potential rivals.   It isn't clear what Mr. Roh will hear during his three-dayvisit, which will include a banquet hosted by EmperorAkihito, meetings with Mr. Kaifu and a speech before theDiet, Japan's parliament. But on the apology question,political observers say the consensus-minded Japaneseprobably will go down to the wire carefully debating thewording of any statement.   At the very least, observers expect that Mr. Roh will heara message similar to the one expressed by the late EmperorHirohito to President Chun Doo Hwan, the first South Koreanhead of state to visit Japan, in 1984. The emperor said at abanquet for Mr. Chun: &quot;It is indeed regrettable that therewas an unfortunate past between us for a period in thiscentury, and I believe that it should not be repeated again.&quot;But Koreans say those remarks were hard to understand anddidn't go far enough.   It also isn't clear just what it will take to satisfy theKoreans. At the moment, many seem intent on using theopportunity of the state visit to stir up the bad bloodbetween the two neighbors. South Korean newspapers are filledthese days with stories about the treatment of Koreans inJapan. One story told of how Koreans were forced to build abomb shelter for the emperor during World War II. Theyrecorded their suffering in Korean script on the walls of theshelter.   Then there is the thorny problem of the current status ofthe 750,000 Korean residents in Japan, an issue that a fewweeks ago threatened to derail Mr. Roh's travel plans.Although an agreement was reached that gives thegrandchildren of the original immigrants the right topermanent residence in Japan, South Korea isn't satisfiedwith how Japan is treating the first and second generationresidents who make up Japan's largest ethnic minority.   The Japanese, meanwhile, are decidedly uncomfortable withthe Koreans airing these issues. In an editorial, theMainichi newspaper said this week that the root of theproblem lies in the fact that Japan hasn't come to terms withcertain aspects of the past.   And some question if an apology will make much difference.&quot;No matter what the emperor says, it won't really changethings between us,&quot; says Mr. Okuda.</TEXT></DOC>
