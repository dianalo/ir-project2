The Teamsters, which last year rejoined the AFL-CIO 30 years after being ousted, went against the labor federation's endorsement of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for president.    The endorsement of Mr. Bush by the union's general executive board, meeting in Grenelefe, Fla., was taken after 21,207 of the union's 1.4 million members returned ballots giving Mr. Bush a 50% to 46% margin over Mr. Dukakis, Teamsters President William McCarthy said.    Mr. McCarthy, who became the union's president this past July after the death of his predecessor, Jackie Presser, was personally opposed to Mr. Dukakis. But he said the board would have backed Mr. Dukakis if the membership poll had gone the other way. &quot;We feel we can get a fair shake&quot; from Mr. Bush, he said.    The Teamsters endorsed Richard Nixon in 1972 and no candidate in 1976. The union also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, but has suffered a recent administration push for further trucking deregulation and a Justice Department lawsuit seeking to oust the union's leaders and impose a court-named trustee over its affairs. Until Mr. McCarthy was elected Teamsters president, the union was thought likely to endorse the Democratic nominee. </TEXT></DOC>
