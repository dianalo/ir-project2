Nearly a year after Congress overrode a presidential veto and imposed economic penalties on the minority-white regime, South Africa's economic growth is accelerating. A white backlash has prompted Pretoria to tighten repression and become even less responsive to U.S. influence. And blacks are suffering the most as U.S. companies pull out of South Africa.    Yet some signs of long-term dividends are emerging. Economists say the sanctions are inhibiting what would have been more-robust growth, creating long-range pressures for Pretoria. And blacks in South Africa and the rest of the continent who once interpreted President Reagan's resistance to sanctions as American support for apartheid are developing new confidence in the U.S.    &quot;Sanctions aren't a quick fix for apartheid. There is a long, protracted struggle in process, and they {sanctions} are part of a pattern of developments that will shorten this time frame and accelerate the onset of negotiations&quot; between the government and majority blacks, says Rep. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.    The sanctions debate, which was quelled by last year's legislation, will begin again next month. The law requires President Reagan to report to Congress on Pretoria's progress in dismantling apartheid and recommend further sanctions if advances haven't been made.    The sanctions already in place include bans on new U.S. loans to the South African government or new investment by American companies, prohibit U.S. exports of petroleum and computers to South Africa and bar imports from South Africa of gold coins, coal, textiles and certain agricultural products.    In the short-run, South Africa's economy hasn't been hit hard by these measures. About 60% of South Africa's export earnings come from gold bullion and strategic metals, which aren't covered by the ban, and Pretoria has found substitute markets for much of its other exports, U.S. analysts say. As a result, the economy is expected to grow an inflation-adjusted 2.5% to 3% this year, up from 1.5% in 1986.    Meanwhile, the sanctions have sent a ripple of anger throughout the white regime. State Department officials say they now have less access to their South African counterparts. For instance, U.S. protests over cases of detention or alleged human-rights abuses, which once prompted responses, now entail long delays or go unanswered.    And, in a clear sign of white backlash, last May's elections increased the ruling National Party's majority in parliament, and the pro-apartheid Conservative Party replaced the moderate Progressive Federal Party as the official opposition.    But advocates of sanctions say the penalties help increase Pretoria's isolation and ultimately will sap the power of the white regime. A State Department analyst calculates that the economy would have grown about one percentage point faster in the absense of sanctions, making it more difficult for South Africa to reach the 5% to 6% annual growth rate needed to keep up with population growth and to cut unemployment.    And from the U.S. point of view, sanctions send a clear signal that the U.S. is on the side of the downtrodden majority, reenforcing blacks' determination. South Africa's state-controlled television carried last year's Senate debate, most likely to show how the country was being attacked from the outside. But the debate also heartened black South Africans by showing the strength of U.S. opposition to the Reagan administration's stand on sanctions.    In the end, there is little the U.S. can do to control events in South Africa. The administration's six-year &quot;constructive engagement&quot; policy, designed to coax Pretoria toward dismantling apartheid, didn't succeed. And sanctions, in the short run won't damage South Africa's self-reliant economy. But the perception of inaction has diplomatic costs for the U.S., and so, for the time being, sanctions seem to be the best bet. </TEXT></DOC>
