Through Sept. 30, daily trading this year has averaged 167 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, down 11% from last year's pace. If that pattern holds for the full year, it will be the first double-digit percentage drop since 1974, when trading sank 14%. And it is shattering Wall Street's customary view that regardless of whether markets go up or down, investors will want to trade ever more briskly.    &quot;A downtrend in volume isn't bullish for the market,&quot; says Robert Colby, a market analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Other market analysts say they aren't so worried. But all are struck by the wide range of investors who have made lasting cutbacks in their trading.    Small investors have generally shied away from the market since last October. Equity mutual funds, meanwhile, have much smaller cash inflows to invest. Frank Mullin, head equity trader at the Putnam mutual funds complex, recalls days last year when Putnam would generate 10 or more orders for 50,000 shares of a major stock. These days, he says, business is half that size or less.    As for other big institutions, John Phelan, chairman of the Big Board, wonders if he's seeing a &quot;fundamental shift&quot; in the way they trade. Their annual portfolio turnover has fallen to 50% this year from 73% last year, he observes. So pension funds and other institutions may be thinking that &quot;less trading produces more results,&quot; Mr. Phelan says.    &quot;We're doing less trading this year,&quot; acknowledges Ed Powell, a portfolio manager at Provident Capital Management, Philadelphia. Mr. Powell ascribes this to his firm's disciplined investment approach. But he adds: &quot;In a rapidly rising market, we rotate out of stocks we think are too expensive. With the market stuck in a trading range the past 10 months, we've tended to stay with our holdings for a longer time.&quot;    It comes down to psychology, says Tom Ryan, head equity trader at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;People are more prone to sell their winners than their losers,&quot; he observes. Until last October, winning stocks abounded. Lately, they've been a lot scarcer.    For much of this year, volume figures have been pumped up 11% to 18% by Japanese investors who traded in and out of high-yield stocks to capture dividend income. In one spectacular case last June, such trading accounted for more than 100 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Such dividend trading was far smaller in 1987, and hardly existed before then.    But now even the Japanese dividend players are pulling out. &quot;It's been quiet since the middle of August,&quot; says Shigenobu Kawata, head U.S. equities trader at Daiwa Securities Co.'s New York office. Local Japanese factors may be changing to the point that Japanese insurers needn't go through such contortions to get dividend income, he explains.    It's harder to gauge the role of program trading -- computerized methods for trading broad baskets of stocks. Recent reports from the Big Board have placed program trading at 8% to 10.5% of daily volume. Statistics for previous years aren't available. But market participants say program trading was at least as prominent last year, though less of a factor in previous years.    For Wall Street, the overall volume slowdown means less revenue and more mischief. Brokers' commissions on New York and American Stock Exchange issues declined 6% to $177.3 million in the second quarter, according to a recent survey reported in Investment Dealers' Digest. Some traders at Wall Street firms privately admit they're passing the day by tossing around footballs and cricket balls.    Some traders believe the slowdown may be pushing up transaction costs, as individual buy and sell orders have more of an impact on market prices. And that illiquidity can feed on itself.    &quot;We're still as eager as ever to trade, but we aren't finding merchandise as readily or as attractively as we used to,&quot; says Barr Rosenberg, head of Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management. Mr. Rosenberg estimates his firm's trading has dwindled 30% this year.    The Big Board's Mr. Phelan, a 33-year veteran of the securities business, says: &quot;We've had droughts that last two to three years, although I'm not predicting that this time. You periodically go through these things. You always worry about them, but we're treating this as a normal course of events.&quot;    While slow volume recently has correlated with bear markets, that hasn't always been the case, observes Laszlo Birinyi Jr., a Salomon Brothers Inc. director and market analyst. But he says one trend appears clear over the years: &quot;The most dangerous scenario appears to be substantially rising volume during a bear market. This usually precedes sharp price drops.&quot;    ---   Steve Swartz contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
