Gas markets have becomenational rather than regional, and the decline in the market has beenregionally and sectorially uneven. This new situation has serious implicationsfor the Canadian gas industry, not only because of decreased exportsto the USA. The gas recently discovered off Canada's Atlantic coast,when commercially developed, will likely be linked to the North Americanpipeline grid for delivery to northeastern USA markets. However, althoughthis appears to be in the classic mode of expansion whereby a new gassource is connected to a nearby market, the new market situation meansthat this new gas cannot escape the new national patterns of competition.In this context, prices are of prime interest; in the deregulated pricingenvironment in the USA, prices in the northeast could be expected toreflect market pricing for cheap southwestern gas (plus transport costs).Other factors affecting the market are the price of gas relative to oil,the short-run demand as affected by the large body of dual-fuel boilerload found in the USA, and gas price competition at the wellhead. Implicationsof these market trends for eastern Canadian gas supply are complex, butthe gradual disappearance of the gas surplus in the USA should raisethe value which Canadian supply can expect to see in northeast markets.5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
