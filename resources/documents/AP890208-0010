Scores of men, heavily armed and dressed in everything fromtribal clothing to captured Soviet helmets and battle jackets,busied themselves with various tasks around the post.   One commander, a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle slung overhis shoulder, shouted orders through a bullhorn.   The commanders said they were trying to set up a rudimentaryadministration at Torkham to handle basic government tasks.Guerrillas were organizing shelters and offices in theadministration block, immigration building and customs.   ``This place is now under Islamic government,'' commander NabibMohammed said.   It appeared to be a relaxed government, at least for the moment.Men at the posts paid little attention to steady streams ofmerchants, fellow guerrillas and local residents crossing the borderin both directions.   A signpost pointed the way to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistanabout 140 miles to the west.   Loudspeakers strung along the road blared Moslem services fromthe town mosque. The wailing incantations echoed in the barren brownhills around Torkham.   Inside administration buildings pocked by gunfire, small groupsof guerrillas drank tea and talked. Torkham changed hands severaltimes before government forces abandoned the area last month.   ``There was much fighting, but now this place is ours,'' Mohammedsaid.   Captured field guns, armored personnel carriers and trucks wereparked near the buildings. Green Islamic flags fluttered from armytrucks that roared up the road from time to time, full of fightingmen.   A partially burned painting of a Soviet soldier and an Afghancomrade clasping hands in friendship had been used to patch a holein a damaged building. Soviet grain sacks were nailed over holes inthe immigration office.   Guerrillas who captured Torkham had scrawled their names on thecaptured walls.   Littering the roadside were charred remains of governmentdocuments they burned. Books, documents and newspapers in Russianwere scattered among the ashes, a last reminder of the Red Armysoldiers who aided the Soviet-supported regime for nine years.   Members of the seven main insurgent groups based in Pakistan helddifferent buildings in the administration complex. Commanders saidthey were taking turns with border duties but many of their men wereilliterate, with little idea of bureaucratic routine.   Large steel shipping containers bearing the names of U.S.,Japanese and West European shipping companies dotted the customscompound.   Torkham was the main entry point for cars, electronic items andother Western good shipped through Pakistan to landlockedAfghanistan. Guerrillas said it might be a long time before importsresumed.   Abdul Zaher, another commander, said the guerrillas must defeatthe Marxist government before starting to rebuild a nation shatteredby 11 years of civil war.   Until that victory, he said, ``about the future we say nothing.''</TEXT></DOC>
