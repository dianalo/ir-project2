The breakthrough is the bio-bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradableprojectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. Ithas been used for three years to immunize animals ranging fromwarthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped outspecies in the park, a 7,800-square-mile reserve.   Anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park, an areawhere 200 rare roan antelope roam. Before 1970, when the park beganan inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animalsfrom the air, severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals.   ``If we have another major outbreak, we have a method now ofcontrolling the epidemic,'' said Valerius de Vos, head of researchat Kruger. ``I consider this a major breakthrough. ... It will beused widely in the future.''   How widely depends to some extent on politics. While SouthAfrica's wildlife management program is regarded as the best on thecontinent, its experts seldom visit other African countries wheresimilar problems exist. Black African governments restrict contactwith South Africa because of apartheid, its system of racialseparation.   ``It's a pity,'' de Vos said. ``The rest of Africa needs us andwe need them. We've got expertise and we need interaction.''   For instance, the numbers of endangered black rhinos areincreasing in South Africa but declining elsewhere. Due to SouthAfrican conservation efforts, the white rhino was removed from theendangered category worldwide.   Representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come toSouth Africa, and exchanges take place by mail, but many Westernuniversities won't send copies of research papers to Kruger'sscientists.   Gus Mills, the chief predator researcher, made a tape recordingof hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night.   ``All the hyena in the area come around to listen and we cancount them,'' he said. ``I've sent my tape to Kenya and now Kenyanhyenas are listening to South African hyenas.''   De Vos said the air-rifle that fires the bio-bullet can belocally produced, but not the bullet itself. He worries whatsanctions could disrupt the immunization program.   There has been talk of banning shipments of four-wheel drivevehicles to South Africa from Japan, because they have militarypotential.   ``That's going to affect us,'' de Vos said. ``I don't know whatwe're going to do, but I guess we can keep going with two-wheeldrive vehicles.''   In 1973 de Vos and his team began inoculating large mammals byfiring dart-syringes from the air. Disadvantages included largenumbers of plastic darts left on the ground, and the time and costof manufacturing the syringes.   De Vos found Fred Paul, an inventor from White Bear Lake, Minn.,who had developed the bio-bullet and used it to vaccinate domesticlivestock and wild bighorn sheep. Paul came to Kruger Park to assistthe research, which includingfiring different-sized bullets atvarying velocities until the right size and shape were determined.   The bullet can be fired rapidly, allowing marksmen to inoculateabout 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy. The material, acellulose polymer, dissolves inside the animal, releasing thevaccine.   Vaccinating 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is``impressive, to say the least. ... That's a lot of animals,'' saidMaurice LeFranc, director of the Institute for Wildlife Research, abranch of National Wildlife Federation in the United States.   The South African park lends itself to such an effort because ithas wide open spaces and concentrations of animals, LeFranc said inVienna, Va.   The project illustrates the place that South African wildliferesearchers have in the forefront of species preservation and theNational Park Board's philosophy about when to let nature take itscourse and when man should intervene.   ``South Africa has taken a real strong leadership in thepreservation and conservation of their wildlife,'' said Dr. WernerHeuschele, an endangered species specialist at the San Diego Zoo inCalifornia. ``Some of their game parks are among the best managed inthe world.''   One researcher at Kruger is capturing impala to find a cure for ahuman-caused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased forlong distances and caught in a net. In the wild, predators chaseimpalas only for short distances.   The main form of research at Kruger is surveillance _ takingaerial photos of vegetation, counting animals, taking blood levelsof elephants to see if car exhaust affects them. The data is fedinto computers to help determine what projects are needed in thepark, a fenced area the size of Massachusetts.   Roads affect the natural spread of fire, so controlled fires areset deliberately. Fenced animals cannot migrate during drought, sodams are built.   In the early 1970s, wildebeest rapidly diminished. A new fencearound the park had cut off one herd's traditional migration route,and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass, rather than the shortgrass the wildebeest like.   Managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass.Instead, they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on thewildebeest.   To prevent the need for such action in the future, Mills and histeam spend two weeks at a time following lions, cheetah andleopards, to monitor their eating habits.   ``Are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living inharmony with their environment?'' Mills says researchers want toknow.   Although anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease are natural Africandiseases, they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 yearsfor the herds to recover after an endemic.   ``Drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature,but we can't afford that,'' said de Vos.   ``We cull (shoot) buffalo and elephant, and sometimes hippo.These are species that can outgrow the system. The rest of theanimals are controlled by the system. Drought, predation, diseaseall act as controls. For the buffalo and elephant the main predatorin the past was man. We have taken man out of it, so now we'rebringing man back in, in a controlled way.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 12</NOTE></DOC>
