(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Richard MarchandM;The battle to determine the next generation of desktop processors is movinginto the marketplace after more than a year of skirmishes among American chipcompanies to gain the support of Asian firms.andM;On one side of the processor-architecture fight are $8.2 billion MotorolaInc. and $2.9 billion Intel Corp., the major manufacturers of ComplexInstruction Set Computer (CISC) chips, which dominate desktop computers.andP;  Onthe other side are $1.8 billion workstation maker Sun Microsystems Inc. and ahost of other companies manufacturing Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)chips.andM;A number of Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese PC makers have signed up with onecamp or the other and are preparing to ship workstations based on either CISCor RISC processors in the next 12 months.andP;  For now CISC proponents have theupper hand, but RISC makers are coming on strong, and it may be only a matterof time before the match is too close to call.andM;At stake is the $2.7 billion in revenues that market researcher DataquestInc., of San Jose, Calif., estimates will be spent by computer makers in 1992on 32-bit microprocessors.andM;Sun, of Mountain View, Calif., began courting Taiwanese computer makers ayear ago to manufacture systems based on Sun's proprietary RISC chip, calledScalable Processor Architecture (SPARC).andP;  Although executives for theTaiwanese companies said they were initially interested in Sun's offer,negotiations bogged down.andM;&quot;Sun was presenting it as now or never,&quot; said Shawn Leuthold, a marketingspecialist with the San Jose-based U.S.andP;  subsidiary of Mitac Group, a $350million Taiwanese firm.andP;  &quot;People realized that wasn't the case.&quot;andM;Soon after introducing its powerful 486 CISC chip earlier this year, IntelCorp., of Santa Clara, Calif., also began wooing Taiwanese computer makers.andO;Major Taiwanese manufacturers such as Mitac and $550 million Acer Group havenow walked away from Sun and are considering Intel.andP;  Sun, however, hascommitments from multibillion-dollar Korean conglomerate Daewoo Group andJapanese giant Fujitsu Ltd., which are expected to ship clones based on Sun'sSPARC chip within a year.andM;Sun, according to industry analysts, is attempting to create a large enoughbase of SPARC computers to attract applications from software developers.andO;Sun expects more than 1,000 applications by the end of this year, about fourtimes last year's level.andP;  Intel, on the other hand, enjoys a huge lead insoftware applications, which it is trying to protect, analysts said.andM;Supporters of SPARC and other RISC microprocessors contend that the speed ofthose chips will eventually bring software developers and systems makers totheir side.andP;  &quot;The CISC machines are not going to close the performance gap,&quot;said John Hennessy, co-founder of MIPS Computer Systems Inc., in Sunnyvale,Calif.andM;But CISC supporters counter that RISC lacks enough software applications toovertake the hardware market.andP;  &quot;RISC boils down to how fast you can runnothing,&quot; quipped Morris Jones, vice president of chip manufacturer Chips andamp;Technologies Inc., also of San Jose.andM;Cost is another key issue, added Jones.andP;  RISC machines may be faster thanCISC-based PCs, but they can cost three to four times more.andP;  RISC proponentsacknowledge the cost of their machines will have to come down for them to becompetitive.andP;  &quot;There's no reason that RISC technology can't be as inexpensiveas a PC,&quot; said Andy Bechtolsheim, the primary designer of Sun's SPARCstation1 workstation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
