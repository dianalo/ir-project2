(computerized monitoringsystems in process plant production)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Blatnica, Leonard J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Computerized monitoring systems, also called data acquisitionnetworks, help prevent hazards and production glitches bymonitoring all types of plant conditions and providing managerswith data gathered and interpreted from remote locations.andO;Hardware and software enhancements make computerized monitoringsystems useful for production facilities of all sizes, includingrefineries, off-shore drilling platforms, ocean-going oil tankers,mines and sewage treatment facilities.andP;  Linking remote sensors,analyzers and relays in diverse environments provides importantinformation in a timely manner, allowing a single operator tomonitor a plant's entire operation.andP;  The structure of a typicalmonitoring system is compared to the human central nervous system:the computer is the brain, the RTUs are the spinal cord and thesensors are the nerve endings.andP;  Use of the systems is described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Remote ControlSensorsProcess ControlControl SystemsSystem DesignProduction ControlData Acquisition SystemsComputer-Aided EngineeringIndustrial Engineering.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
