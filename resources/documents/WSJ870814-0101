Sceptre said it will exchange 13,540,000 treasury shares for all the assets of Soquip Alberta Inc., a unit of the Quebec government's oil and gas agency, Societe Quebecoise d'Initiatives Petrolieres, or Soquip. It said Sceptre also will assume 159.8 million Canadian dollars ($120 million) of Soquip Alberta debt. The transaction has an indicated value of about 236 million dollars and requires regulatory and shareholder approval.    In a related transaction, Sceptre said Noverco Inc. and the Quebec government's pension-fund manager, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, each have tentatively agreed to buy 37.5 million dollars of a 160 million-dollar issue of new Sceptre securities. Noverco is a Montreal-based gas distribution company in which Caisse and Soquip each hold a 15% stake. Sceptre said the purchases are subject to approval by the boards of Caisse and Noverco.    The transactions will leave Soquip with a 22% stake in Sceptre, Caisse with 17% and Noverco with 6%.    Richard Gusella, president and chief executive officer of Sceptre, said the acquisition will increase his company's proven and probable reserves to 600 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 34 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. Sceptre's reserves were 345 billion cubic feet and 23 million barrels at the end of last year.    Mr. Gusella said proceeds from the 160 million dollars of new securities will be used to repay the debts assumed from Soquip Alberta. He said the securities have been sold to investment dealers headed by Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Toronto, a unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York. They consist of 80,000 units, each exchangeable into 200 common shares of Sceptre and a 1,000-dollar, 8% debenture convertible into common at the rate of six dollars ($4.51) of debentures for each share. Sceptre closed at $4, up 12.5 cents, when it last traded on the American Stock Exchange Aug. 6.    Soquip acquired its Alberta oil and gas properties in 1984 through the acquisition of Denver-based Sundance Oil Co. for $95 million. Most of Sundance's assets were in Canada. Soquip subsequently sold 50% of Sundance's producing properties in Alberta to Westmin Resources Ltd. of Calgary.    Quebec's energy minister, John Ciaccia, said in a statement that the swap of Soquip's Alberta assets for a stake in Sceptre was a way of involving Soquip more closely with the private sector. Quebec recently has been selling many of its provincially owned companies.    A spokeswoman for Caisse de Depot declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
