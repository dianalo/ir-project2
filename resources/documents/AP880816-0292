Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the exodus reflects increasedrepresssion by the leftist Sandinista government and the direcondition of Contra units that have been left without any means ofresupply inside Nicaragua.   ``The blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the Sandinistaregime has resulted in severe hunger, disease and injury to someresistance fighters,'' she said.   According to reports from the border area, more than 1,000soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a centralNicaraguan combat zone. Another group, estimated at about 2,500, issaid to be en route to the area.   The Contra leadership said the new arrivals joined about 8,000combatants and 5,000 civilians.   The assistance, part of $17 million in humanitarian aid approvedfor the rebels by Congress last March, is intended to help sustainthe Contras through September.   Last week, the Senate approved by a 49-47 vote a Democratic planto provide $27 million in humanitarian assistance to the Contras inthe new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Senate Republicans, who hadsought military as well as humanitarian assistance, voted againstthe proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
