Under the agreement with the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Bath Iron Works, a unit of Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd., New York, also agreed to pay fines of $650,000, substantially less than the record $4.2 million in penalties that OSHA proposed last November.    But the company also agreed to provide &quot;substantial and meaningful financial support&quot; for operation of a new state Occupational Health and Safety Training Resource Center in Auburn, Maine, OSHA said.    In addition, Bath Iron Works agreed to eliminate hazards cited by OSHA, by April 1, 1989; to begin a corporate-wide safety and health program; and to bring its policies and practices into compliance with OSHA standards by next April 1.    The company also agreed to take other corrective actions by Oct. 15, 1989; give OSHA a compliance plan for major electrical projects by next Jan. 1; keep adequate compliance records, and permit reasonable OSHA inspections and entry for monitoring compliance with the agreement. Bath Iron Works agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying guilt as to the OSHA allegations.    OSHA had cited the company's shipyard in Bath, Maine, for unsafe practices, including exposing workers to asbestos-laden dust, radiation and raw sewage in some work areas. The agency also listed 641 record-keeping violations. The agency contended there was &quot;a complete breakdown in the shipbuilder's safety and health program.&quot;    OSHA agreed that assuming the company carries out the agreement in good faith, the regulatory agency won't conduct a general inspection of the areas covered by a Bath Iron Works audit program, before Oct. 15, 1989. Nor will OSHA cite Bath Iron Works prior to that date for any of the violations identified in the agreement, if they are being &quot;reasonably addressed&quot; by the company.    But OSHA will continue to conduct inspections based on complaints, deaths or other specific reasons.    The new state training center will provide education for a two-year associate's degree in occupational health and safety, and preparatory courses for certification programs in safety and industrial hygiene, and will train Maine companies' employers and workers, OSHA said. The center is being developed by the Central Maine Vocational Technical Institute.    Under its agreement with OSHA, Bath Iron Works will provide financial support for the center and assistance in developing its curriculum. The company will also provide teaching help and aid for internship programs for students. </TEXT></DOC>
