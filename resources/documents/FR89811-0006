Writtencomments were solicited by the Board, with the comment period ending March28, 1989. The Board invited commenters to address all aspects of the proposal, includingthe conditions that should apply to automatically approved applications.Specifically, the Board solicited comment on whether such conditions shouldbe included at all, whether the proposed rules should be expanded, modified,or deleted in part, and whether any requirements should be promulgatedin the form of supervisory guidance. The Board received a total of 3 comments in response to the proposal, allof which expressed support for the proposal. Of the comments received,two came from law firms that represent thrift institutions and one camefrom a national thrift trade organization. While each of the comments expressedsupport for the proposal, several suggested certain modifications in theconditions that should apply to automatically approved applications. Aftercarefully considering the issues raised by the commenters, the Board hasdetermined to adopt the proposal with certain modifications and clarifications.The final regulations provide for automatic approval of applications byinsured institutions for approval of routine reorganizations involvingthe creation of savings and loan holding companies, subject to specifiedrequirements. Such applications will be automatically approved 45 calendardays after the filing of the application unless the Board or its delegatehas either requested additional information from the applicant in writing,notified the applicant that the application is materially deficient andwill not be processed, or denied the application. Given the types of transactionsand other conditions established for the availability of the automaticapproval process, it is the Board's expectation that any requests for additionalinformation that would prolong the 45 day decision period would be extremelyrare. The new regulations also provide for a corresponding streamlinedapproval for permission to organize and insurance of accounts, and forthe merger of a disappearing interim institution that is used as a componentof the reorganization transaction. While the proposal published in January 1989 envisioned automatic approvalof holding company reorganization applications 30 calendar days after filing,the Board notes that applications filed under 12 CFR 574.3(a) require publicnotice and are subject to a public comment period that may be extendedto 40 calendar days after filing pursuant to 12 CFR 574.6(e). Thus, holdingcompany reorganization applications, in order to be automatically approved30 calendar days after filing, would need to be exempted from the publicnotice requirement, or, alternatively, the automatic approval date wouldhave to be tied to the end of the public comment period. After consideringthis issue, the Board, in an effort to maximize public participation inthe application process consistent with existing regulations and to maintaincertainty with respect to the automatic approval date, has determined toextend the automatic approval date to 45 calendar days after filing. TheBoard wishes to emphasize, however, that, notwithstanding the automaticapproval mechanism in the new regulations, the Board's staff will processholding company reorganization applications expeditiously and, where appropriate,will notify applicants in writing that the application has been approvedprior to the expiration of the 45 day period for automatic approval.In order to qualify for automatic approval under the new regulations, anapplication must involve only the creation of a holding company by an insuredinstitution and no other transaction incident thereto (other than the creationof an interim institution that will disappear upon consummation of thereorganization and the merger of the insured institution with such interiminstitution), and the applicant company must not be seeking any regulatorywaivers, regulatory forbearances, or resolution of legal or supervisoryissues. In addition, the application must not present any significant policyissues pursuant to applicable Board policies. One comment letter asked for further clarification as to what would constitutean ``other transaction'' within the meaning of the rule and thus renderthe automatic approval mechanism unavailable. It is the Board's intentthat any transaction that is not a direct component of the reorganizationtransaction or would otherwise normally require another approval from theBoard or its delegate, would generally cause the automatic approval mechanismto become unavailable. Examples of transactions that would have such aneffect, if intended to be accomplished as part of the reorganization orshortly after consummation, would include the payment of management feesto the holding company by the insured institution, the incurrence of debtby the holding company, transactions involving the purchase, sale, or leaseof property or assets between the holding company and the insured institution,and other affiliate transactions that may be prohibited or restricted.Any inquiries relating to specific transactions and whether engaging insuch transactions as part of a reorganization would render the automaticapproval mechanism unavailable should be directed to the Corporate andSecurities Division of the Board's Office of General Counsel in Washington,DC.The Board wishes to point out, however, that the automatic approval mechanismwould be available to an institution whose reorganization is part of astandard conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organization.In this regard, a converting institution also is required to file a FormAC to obtain approval to convert. The Form AC, among other things, is requiredto describe the complete transaction in detail and must include as exhibitsall of the documents prepared in connection with the conversion. Accordingly,many of the issues presented in a holding company, application requiredfor a holding company conversion will be reviewed and passed upon by theBoard in its review of the Form AC. Accordingly, the Board believes thatexpedited processing of a holding company application filed as part ofa holding company conversion is appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing,the Board urges converting institutions that are contemporaneously reorganizinginto the holding company form to file their holding company applicationsand their Forms AC concurrently, or file their holding company applicationsbefore their Forms AC. In several instances in the past, converting institutionshave filed required holding company applications well after the Forms AChave been filed, resulting in a delay in the conversion process while theprocessing of the holding company application was completed. To avoid sucha possibility, converting institutions are urged to file holding companyapplications as early as possible, even in cases where the automatic approvalprocess is available.Another condition of qualifying for automatic approval under the new regulationsis that the initial capitalization of the holding company (to the extentthat the capital is provided by the insured institution itself) must notexceed the amount that the insured institution could pay in dividends toits holding company as of the date of the reorganization pursuant to applicableregulations, or, in the absence of such regulations, pursuant to the thencurrent Board policy guidelines issued by the Board's  Office of RegulatoryActivities (``ORA'') (<T3>See e.g., </T3>Office of Regulatory Activities, Thrift Bulletin No.5 (October 19, 1988)). While the proposal published in January 1989 envisionedan initial capitalization standard based on the lesser of the amount thatthe insured institution could pay in dividends or the amount that the institutioncould invest in a service corporation, the Board, after considering severalcomments on this issue, has determined to adopt  an initial capitalizationstandard based on the ability of an institution to pay dividends sincethis standard is more directly relevant to the holding company transactionthat is occurring. The Board, among other things, does not wish to precludehealthy, well-capitalized institutions from reorganizing into holding companyform pursuant to the automatic approval mechanism simply because such institutionsmay have fully utilized their service corporation investment authority.Such a result could occur under the initial capitalization standard setforth in the original proposal. Accordingly, the Board believes a dividend-basedinitial capitalization standard is appropriate.In addition to the foregoing, to qualify for automatic approval under thenew regulations, the board of directors and executive officers of the newholding company must be composed of persons who are, at the time of thereorganization, executive officers and directors of the insured institution,although they need not hold the same positions, and all executive officersand directors of the institution need not also be executive officers anddirectors of the holding company.In a policy statement dated August 2, 1988 (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 31761 (August 19, 1988)), the Board provided guidanceon the extent to which savings and loan holding companies should be requiredto contribute financial assistance to their subsidiary insured institutionsand, in particular, whether a proposed acquiror of an insured institutionwould be required to execute a regulatory capital maintenance agreementas a condition to receiving approval of a proposed acquisition. For thereasons set forth in the policy statement, a proposed acquiror has theoption of executing either (i) a regulatory capital maintenance agreementproviding for a specified dollar cap on the amount of the acquiror's maintenanceobligation, or (ii) a so-called ``prenuptial'' agreement, which providesfor the transfer to the Board of the right to vote the securities of theinstitution, remove the board of directors of the institution, cause additionalsecurities of the institution to be issued to the Board, or dispose ofany or all of the securities of the institution owned by the acquiror,in the event the institution's capital level declines below a specifiedlevel. At the direction of the Board, the Board's Office of RegulatoryActivities, in Thrift Bulletin No. 5, dated October 19, 1988, issued policyguidelines on, among other things, the amount of the dollar cap that willgenerally be required in a regulatory capital maintenance agreement and,with respect to prenuptial agreements, the minimum capital level that mustbe maintained by the institution in order to avoid triggering the transferto the Board of the various powers described above. Agreements that exceedthe scope of these guidelines are considered to present significant policyissues that warrant consideration by the Board itself. Accordingly, inorder to qualify for automatic approval under the new regulations, thereorganization transaction must not raise a significant policy issue asdescribed in the Board's August 12, 1988 policy statement or the ORA Guidelinesof October 19, 1988. The proposed holding company in the reorganizationwould, therefore, generally be required to submit, prior to consummationof the reorganization, either a ``dollar capped'' regulatory capital maintenanceagreement or a ``prenuptial'' agreement that, in either case, is consistentwith the Board's policy statement and the ORA guidelines. We note in thisregard, however, that, pursuant to the ORA Guidelines, if an institutionwould meet its fully-phased in capital requirement following consummationof the reorganization transaction, neither the regulatory capital maintenanceagreement nor the prenuptial agreement would be required. The proposedholding company would be required, however, to enter into a dividend limitationagreement described in the ORA Guidelines prior to consummation of thereorganization transaction in all cases and would, in the future, be subjectto any general regulations adopted by the Board to set standards for paymentof dividends and other ``capital distributions'' by insured institutions.In addition to the foregoing requirements, the new regulations requirethe holding company to file certain certifications and opinions with theinsured institution's Supervisory Agent within a specified time beforeor after the consummation of the acquisition. These certifications andopinions are customarily required to be filed by holding companies completingthe prior approval process under current Board regulations. These requirementsare as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) On the business day prior to the date of consummation of the acquisition,the chief financial officers of the holding company and the insured institutionshall certify to the Supervisory Agent in writing that no material adverseevents or material adverse changes have occurred with respect to the financialcondition or operations of the holding company or the insured institutionsince the date of the financial statements submitted with the application;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of theacquisition, the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agenta certification by legal counsel stating the effective date of the acquisition,the exact number of shares of stock of the insured institution acquiredby the holding company, and that the acquisition has been consummated inaccordance with the provisions of all applicable laws and regulations andthe application; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of theacquisition, the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agentan opinion from its independent auditors certifying that the transactionwas consummated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) No later than thirty days from the date of consummation of theacquisition, the holding company shall file with the Supervisory Agenta certification stating that the holding company will not cause the insuredinstitution to deviate materially from the business plan submitted in connectionwith the application, unless prior written approval from the SupervisoryAgent is obtained.</ITAG>Similar standard certifications are required to be furnished by the resultinginstitution in the event an interim institution is organized to facilitatethe reorganization transaction. The new regulations also require that the proposed acquisition be consummatedwithin 120 days after the application is automatically approved. Finally, the Board notes that the new regulations provide that in caseswhere the insured institution has converted from mutual to stock form,the institution's newly formed holding company will become subject to certainpost-conversion requirements that are applicable to the institution itselfpursuant to various sections of the Board's mutual to stock conversionregulations. This treatment of the holding company simply insures thatcreation of a holding company will not be used as a route to evade suchpost-conversion safeguards. These safeguards, which pertain to post- conversionacquisitions of an institution's stock, purchases and sale of conversionstock by the institution's officers and directors, registration of thestock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the existence of market-makersin the institution's stock, and restrictions on certain stock repurchases,have customarily been imposed as conditions of approval of holding companyapplications where converted institutions reorganize into holding companystructure. Treatment of this area in the regulation avoids the need forsuch a cumbersome conditioning process. The Board believes that the new regulations further expedite and streamlinethe application process under Part 574 by reducing substantially the processingperiod for routine holding company reorganization applications.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.605, the Board certifies that these changes will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly,a final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 574 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Savings and loan associations, Securities,Holding companies.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends part 574, Subchapter D, Charter V,Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">PART 574_ACQUISITION OF CONTROL OF INSURED INSTITUTIONS </ITAG>The authority citation for Part 574 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 407, 48 Stat. 1260, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1730);sec. 408, 82 Stat. 5, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1730a).</ITAG>(2) Amend andSection;
