(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Protection at a PremiumandM;The silent pledge of the new PC owner, taken as he removes the preciousmachine from its snug molded cushions and welcomes it to a new home, runssomething like this: &quot;I will protect this computer from harm.andP;  It will remainpristine, carefully shieleded from dust, grime, and hazard.&quot;andM;Promises, promises.andM;New owners mean well.andP;  One Florida writer, who found that the muse sangloudest when he sat by his backyard swimming pool, always took great pains toensure that his landlubbing PC had a solid poolside perch.andP;  A New Yorkbusinessman accustomed to taking his PC along on trips would check the carbefore leaving to make sure the computer was secure in the back seat, in casehe had to brake suddenly.andM;But even the best intentions go awry.andP;  The Floridian's computer sank to awatery grave when his enthusiastic dog knocked over the PC's stand.andP;  And theNew Yorker?andP;  Thieves stole his computer when he walked to the rear of the carto change a flat tire.andM;Even more unfortunate than these losses is discovering too late thathomeowners' policies, which people often believe are their protection of lastresort, don't insure personal computers against mishaps and accidents.andM;Basic homeowners' packages come up woefully short in their coverage of PCs.andO;Not only do they fail to protect against breakage, upended coffee cups, andpower surges that can fry circuit  boards faster than a two-minute egg; theyalso drastically curtail coverage for misfortunes that occur away from home.andO;Such policies make no allowances for custom software or files stored on disk.andO;Worst of all, most reimburse policy-holders only for the system's worth atthe time of the loss--not for the cost of replacing it.andM;Unfazed by danger until it strikes, however, PC owners often continue toupgrade their systems without checking into upgrading their insurance aswell.andP;  Members of the Boston Computer Society, for example, have estimatedthat they spend a collective $57 million per year on computer-relatedhardware, software, and services.andM;Insurers are beginning to write policies that protect home PCs, partlybecause of the increase in the value of home computing systems, but mainlybecause of their growing numbers (a 1988 Gallup poll found PCs in 18 percentof households surveyed).andM;No Place Like HomeandM;Homeowners' coverage typically guards against a standard list of perilsincluding fire, wind damage, and theft.andP;  But home computers remaindefenseless against calamities not usually covered by insurance: chidlren,pets, and adults who balance a plate of left-overs in one hand while theyupdate household finances with the other.andM;Some of the offbeat claims filed by computer owners underscore the theorythat the home is anything but a haven for PCs.andP;  Such claims have been amainstay of SafeWare since the Columbus, Ohio, computer insurer opened itsdoors in 1981.andP;  Claimants include a Californian whose ten-gallon fish tanktipped over on his IBM PC-XT, and a family that lost all its software whenits cat, upset by the commotion of moving to a new home, crawled into a crateand mistook disks for kitty litter.andM;During nearly eight years of business, SafeWare founder David Johnston hasalso witnessed a rise in the PC's popularity among burglars.andP;  Computers aretougher to steal than jewelry, and they lack the known street value of VCRsor stereo components, but they're still attractive targets.andM;&quot;When we first started, computers were stolen in pieces,&quot; says Johnston,whose interest in computer insurance began in 1980 when he purchased an Atari800 and discovered that his homeowners' policy wouldn't cover it.andP;  &quot;A monitormight be stolen because the thief confused it with the TV.andP;  Now, we see wholesystems being taken.andP;  They take everything, including the software and backupdiskettes.&quot;andM;Sifting through the OptionsandM;To get the protection their PCs need, consumers must investigate abewildering array of policies, stipulations, and costs.andM;Some insurers limit homeowners' PC coverage to a specific dollar amount, justas they do with jewelry.andP;  State Farm, for instance, insures PCs for up to$3,000 and lets policyholders buy an additional $5,000 of coverage for $20.andM;Other companies insure all of a home's contents for a fixed amount andinclude the home PC under that umbrella.andP;  Metropolitan Life's homeowners'policy insures the contents of a residence for 50 percent of their value.andO;The contents of a dwelling with $100,000 worth of goods would be insured to$50,000, and the policy would roll PC coverage into that figure.andM;A number of insurers are moving to cover home PCs through attachments to thehomeowners' policy, known as riders, endorsements, declarations, or floaters.andO;This year, in fact, PC riders will be available in 42 states.andP;  These allowmore complete protection and involve several variables; generally, you canselect your own terms and coverage limits.andP;  The cost of the additionalprotection averages about $1 for each $100 of coverage.andM;Another option is to take out a separate policy for your PC; people withelaborate home computing systems often take this approach.andP;  Such policies aretypically scheduled, meaning that consumers must document the hardware,software, and peripherals they want covered and prove ownership through salesreceipts or written appraisals.andP;  This type of coverage entails more work onthe consumer's part, but it offers a financial advantage--there's often nodeductble.andP;  (Deductibles on homeowners' policies range from $100 to $500.)andM;Coming to TermsandM;Consumers should check into the terms of coverage that apply to PCs.andO;Homeowners frequently take out all-risk policies to safeguard expensivebelongings such as jewelry and fur coats.andP;  all-risk protection applies to anysort of mishap; one insurer refers to it as &quot;klutz coverage.&quot;andP;  It's an optionthat's available--and encourage--for PC owners.andP;  This expanded coverage costsmore and is usually available through an endorsement to a homeowner's policyor through a separate policy.andM;Replacement-value coverage is equally important, since a PC's value starts todepreciate as soon as it comes out of the box.andP;  Policies commonly reimburseconsumers only for the amount of money their system was worth at the time ofthe disaster, not what it costs to replace it.andM;On problem in obtaining better home PC coverage is that these computers defycategorization.andP;  Pressed into family service for purposes of education,entertainment, and record-keeping, home PCs also take occasional turns asbusiness machines.andP;  That multivariate identity presents dilemmas for insurersand consumers alike.andP;  Most homeowners' policies apply only to domesticpossessions; they specifically exclude business or office equipment, even ifit's located in the home.andM;Insurers respond in various ways to multipurpose PCs.andP;  Some take a firmstance against business use and slash PC coverage to as little as $250 if thesystem is used even occasionally for work.andP;  Mindful that home PCs oftenstraddle the fence as both personal and business machines, however, moreinsurers are abandoning their business exclusions and covering home PCsregardless of how they're used.andP;  Liberty Mutual underwrites a named-perilsendorsement to its homeowners' policy that provides protection whether theequipment is used for commercial or family purposes.andP;  And this spring,Metropolitan Life plans to roll out a new line of PC coverage that containsno business exclusions.andM;Insurance companies that retain the exclusion often continue to cover whatthey call &quot;incidental business use&quot;--which means you're covered if youoccasionally bring work home from the office and run it on the computer inyour family's den.andP;  &quot;I would assume that's happening quite often,&quot; says KenNigohosian, area underwriting manager for Safeco in Fountain Valley,California.andP;  &quot;Even our insurance agents may have a PC at home for thatreason.&quot;andM;Despite the recent loosening of insurance guidelines on using home PCs forbusiness, other situations that can confront PC owners remain largelyuncovered.andP;  Little protection is available for stored data, includingrecords, charts, graphics, and text.andP;  Insurers point to the difficulty ofplacing a dollar value on information.andP;  In insurance lingo, such protectionis called &quot;re-creation of data&quot; or &quot;reproduction&quot; coverage.andP;  Companies thatdo offer this kind of coverage generally figure the loss as a percentage ofthe consumer's total coverage.andP;  For example, a $10,000 policy might pay 10percent, or $1,000, for data that has been destroyed.andM;Software authors have even fewer places to turn.andP;  Major carriers insure onlyretail programs; they cover no software that's written by you or for you.andO;Data Security Insurance, a small agency in Boulder, Colorado, is one companythat does insure custom software, paying for the rekeying of lost programs.andM;Specialists in PC InsuranceandM;Specialty insurers such as SafeWare and Data Security offer consumers analternative to the coverage provided by conventional carriers.andP;  SafeWare is amail order insurer that writes all-risk policies to cover the replacementcosts of PCs that are damaged or lost while in the home or office or intransit.andP;  Premiums start at $39 for $2,000 coverage, and all policies have a$50 deductible.andP;  Proof of ownership is required only when a claim is filed.andO;SafeWare's policies number in the tens of thousands, says founder Johnston,and its corporate clients include Business Week magazine, ColumbiaUniversity, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology.andM;Data Security specializes in filling in where other policies leave off.andP;  Inaddition to covering custom software, the company insures against accidentalloss of data.andP;  It also covers the theft of a computer from an unattendedautomobile, something few other insurers will do.andP;  And it pays for rental ofa computer while the insured's equipment is being repaired or replaced.andP;  DataSecurity's rates for home and business PCs begin at $35 for $2,000 worth ofcoverage.andM;Both SafeWare and Data Security Insurance are among the only insurers thatoffer protection for hardware in the event of a power surge.andP;  Traditionalinsurers--except for Aetna Life andamp; Casualty--exclude coverage for electricaldisturbances that do not originate on the policyholder's premises.andP;  Thatincludes power surges and lightning.andM;Even though PCs have built-in power protectors, many users equip theirsystems with surge protectors, and these devices help to some degree.andP;  Butmany PC owners fail to buy the model that's most appropriate for their powerneeds, or don't realize that surge protectors wear out and must be replaced.andO;Ordinarily, an unregulated surge of power will destroy the power supplyfirst, then the motherboard.andP;  Modems, however, give the electrical charge anadditional route to travel, which can result in even more damage.andM;The lesson remains the same, whether it's lighning, a power surge, yourmorning java, or a near-sighted cat.andP;  If computer equipment is worth havingin your home, it's worth insuring properly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
