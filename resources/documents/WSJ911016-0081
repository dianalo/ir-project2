The generally better-than-expected results, along withsigns that loan problems may be stabilizing, helped to sparka rally in bank stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Even Security Pacific, which posted an unexpectedly big$513.9 million loss, gained $1.375 a share to $32.50 on theNew York Stock Exchange.   Chemical Banking Corp. posted a profit compared with ayear-earlier loss, reflecting increased revenue fromsecurities trading and lower loan-loss provisions. Its stockrose 75 cents to $26.125.   Manufacturers Hanover Corp., which has agreed to mergewith Chemical, saw its stock rise $1.875 to $29.25. Itsearnings of $77 million were unchanged from the year-earlierperiod.   Even banks that posted a loss or a large decline inearnings benefited from the rally. Candamp;S/Sovran, which incurreda loss, saw its stock rise $1 to $29.75.   In addition, the stocks of Wells Fargo andamp; Co., whoseearnings dropped 47%, and First Chicago Corp., whose profitsdeclined 32%, climbed $3.875 and $1, respectively, to $71.25and $25.   Banc One Corp.'s earnings surpassed Wall Street forecasts,although its share price fell 37.5 cents to $44.375.   &quot;The picture isn't nearly as bleak as people were led tobelieve,&quot; said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyetteandamp; Woods Inc., an investment firm specializing in bank stocks.&quot;Most banks are on target or exceeded our expectations.&quot;                                                                                                          Security Pacific                                                                                                          Huge losses for the bank were caused by a $1.21 billionloan-loss provision. The company had been expected to take acharge of about $1 billion to clear the decks for its plannedmerger with BankAmerica.   But marked deterioration in the California economy seemsto have necessitated an even bigger charge, and the resultswere surprisingly poor in their own right, reflecting a$103.4 million drop in net interest income because ofshrinking assets and a surge in actual loan losses to $392.6million from $204.3 million a year ago.   To shore up its capital position, Security Pacific's boardvoted to suspend its 38-cent quarterly dividend. The companyhad been expected to continue paying the dividend untilcompletion of the acquisition, scheduled to close sometimeearly next year. The suspension will save Security Pacificabout $48.7 million each quarter until it merges withBankAmerica.   Robert Smith, Security Pacific's chairman, said, &quot;While weare disappointed with the results for the quarter,strengthening our reserve is necessary in view of continuedadverse economic conditions in several of our key markets,including California. We expect loan losses in the fourthquarter of the year to remain at high levels.&quot;   He added that &quot;BankAmerica has advised Security Pacific .. . that the results . . . do not alter BankAmerica'sassessment of the overall benefits of the planned merger.Both companies are proceeding with the regulatory filingsnecessary to effectuate the merger.&quot; The company declined tocomment on whether the size of its losses and the state ofits loan portfolio have nonetheless been an ugly surprise toBankAmerica.   A person familiar with Security Pacific's originalnegotiations with BankAmerica said, &quot;The provision isn'tinconsistent with the earlier announcement.&quot; Another sourcesaid, &quot;You have to assume that BankAmerica is living in there{Security Pacific}, going through these loans piece bypiece.&quot;   The provision added $813.9 million to Security Pacific'sreserve against future losses, boosting it to $2.35 billion,or 87% of nonperforming loans, compared with 58% at June 30.&quot;That probably matters more than anything else&quot; in keepingthe merger on track, said Donald Crowley, a bank analyst withKeefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc. The average reserve for the top25 banks in the U.S. is roughly two-thirds of nonperformingloans.   The credit losses indicate that Security Pacific'snonperforming loans jumped $441.6 million in the quarter.After the loan charge-offs, the net increase in nonperformingloans was $49 million, to a total of $2.69 billion. Most ofthe loan losses were related to commercial real-estate loansin the U.S. and the United Kingdom.                                                                                                          Chemical Banking                                                                                                          The New York bank holding company posted a sharpturnaround, aided by strong results from its Texas CommerceBancshares unit, which posted record earnings of $34.7million compared with $22.9 million a year ago.   The bank outperformed Wall Street forecasts as itbenefited from wider spreads between the cost of funds andthe fees it charges its customers. Analysts were expectingthe bank to report earnings of about 66 cents a share.   The improved report also reflected a lower provision forloan losses at $145 million compared to $250 million a yearearlier, and higher profits from securities trading. Profitgains were partly offset, however, by greater expensesrelated to increases in foreclosed property costs, higherinsurance fees, and a rise in employee incentivecompensations.   Net interest income rose 13.3% to $588 million from $519million, primarily reflecting a lower cost of funds and ahigher level of credit card debt outstanding. Meanwhile,nonperforming loans were $2.6 billion as of Sept. 30, adecline of $59 million from June 30 and of $134 million fromDec. 31, 1990. Total nonperforming assets as of Sept. 30 were$3.43 billion.                                                                                                          Manufacturers Hanover                                                                                                          Earnings were unchanged for the New York bank holdingcompany as increases in net interest revenue and profits fromsecurities trading were offset by higher loan-lossprovisions, which increased to $168 million from $115 milliona year ago. The bank blamed the increased provisions on theweak economy, which hurt its loan portfolio.   Net interest revenue rose to $425 million from $381million a year ago, aided by lower interest rates thatincreased the spread between what it paid for funds and whatit charged customers. That spread, or net interest margin,increased to 3.01% from 2.41%.   Noninterest revenue, which includes fees and gains frominvestments, declined to $351 million from $360 million ayear earlier. Huge increases of 138% in trading profits wereoffset by lower foreign exchange revenue and corporatefinance fees, among others.   Total reserves for possible loan losses as of Sept. 30increased to $723 million, up $223 million, or 45%, from $500million in the same period a year ago.                                                                                                          Wells Fargo                                                                                                          Wells Fargo's earnings were depressed by a near-triplingin its loan-loss provision, to $200 million in the thirdquarter from $75 million in the year-ago period. The movereflected a big jump in loan charge-offs, which rose to $123million from $46 million a year ago mostly because of problemreal-estate loans. Nonperforming loans jumped 20%, or $303million, from the previous quarter to $1.82 billion. Thecompany noted, however, that $780 million of itsnonperforming loans were actually current on principal andinterest, indicating that these were classified asnonperforming because of uncertain propects of repayment.   A $47 million increase in net interest income and a $29million rise in noninterest income about offset a $77 millionjump in noninterest expense.   Although the earnings were below the mean estimate ofstock analysts, investors appeared to be relieved that theprovision wasn't larger. Wells Fargo is heavily exposed toboth commercial real-estate and leveraged buy-out loans,although it is also regarded as one of the best underwritersof such credits. Most of Wells Fargo's second-quarterearnings were wiped out by a $350 million provision, mainlyfor leveraged buy-out loans.   Analysts still expect more large provisions forreal-estate loans. Yesterday, the company's statement saidthat &quot;no assurance can be given&quot; that it won't needsignificantly greater provisions, given &quot;economic conditionsand the company's on-going examination process and that ofits regulators.&quot;                                                                                                          Candamp;S/Sovran                                                                                                          The bank's loss was largely expected, following thecompany's disclosure in early October that it continues to behurt by increases in nonperforming assets and its decision tomake a $300 million provision to its allowance for creditlosses.   The company, with dual headquarters in Atlanta andNorfolk, Va., said it suffered &quot;continued deterioration&quot; inits real-estate portfolio, particularly in the Virginia andWashington, D.C., markets. The company is preparing to mergewith NCNB Corp of Charlotte, N.C. The two companies have setshareholder meetings Nov. 1 in Charlotte and Atlanta to voteon the proposal.   Candamp;S/Sovran said nonperforming assets totaled $1.6 billion,up 26% from $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter.Included in the new total were increases in nonperformingreal-estate assets of $140 million in metropolitanWashington, D.C., and Virginia and $44 million in Florida.   The final provision for credit losses totaled $304.7million, compared with $169.5 million in the second quarterand $85.4 million in the 1990 third quarter.                                                                                                          First Chicago                                                                                                          Excluding the $35 million pretax restructuring charge, theChicago bank would have reported earnings of 52 cents ashare. Although the operating earnings were still belowanalysts' estimates of about 58 cents a share, investors werepleased with the decline in the bank's nonperforming assets,which dropped 8% to $1.44 billion at the end of the thirdquarter from $1.56 billion at June 30.   Net interest income declined to $280.9 million from $298.3million as interest earnings from deposits fell sharply to$404.2 million from $587.4 million. As well, noninterestincome decreased slightly to $312.2 million from $312.6million a year ago, as increases in trading profits wereoffset by lower gains from investments.   Expenses rose 8% to $445.3 million from $410.9 millionreflecting increased costs associated with foreclosing realestate properties. Provisions for possible loan losses in thequarter declined to $105 million from $155 million.                                                                                                          Banc One                                                                                                          The bank, based in Columbus, Ohio, benefited from strongretail loan growth, which helped boost its net interestmargin to 6.13% from 5.28%. The company also reported thatits annualized return on average assets reached 1.73%, upfrom 1.55% a year.   But for the sixth consecutive quarter, Banc One increasedits reserve for possible loan losses, which now totals $401million, or 1.73% of total loans, compared with $292 million,or 1.47% of loans, a year ago. The company's loan-lossprovision was raised by $85.5 million from $76.2 million ayear ago. Total nonperforming assets rose to $513 million, or2.21% of loans at the end of the quarter. Last year, totalnonperforming assets were $405 million, or 2.04% of loans.   ---                               1991           1990                           in      per      in    per    %                        millions   share millions share chg.
