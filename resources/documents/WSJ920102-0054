In Asia, the region's economies are the world's strongest,the quickest to adjust in times of crisis, and are pegged tooutpace others for years to come. Therefore, its volatilestock markets are terrific bets -- even amid global crisessuch as the Persian Gulf War, the Soviet Union'sdisintegration and the U.S. recession.</LP><TEXT>   In Europe, most markets ended the year creeping sidewaysor slipping slightly. In 1992, the former Soviet Union islikely to dominate trading, along with questions of a U.S.economic recovery and German interest rate cuts. For Britishstocks, add the election for the prime minister's post to thehost of uncertainties.   In Canada, stocks underperformed their U.S. counterpartsin 1991 and economists say any gains this year probably willbe modest.   Here is a market-by-market summary:                                                                                                          LONDON                                                                                                          A tenacious recession and uncertainty over whether PrimeMinister John Major's Conservative Party can remain in powerwere hobbling the market at year end, just as earlieroptimism on both counts had help to push shares higher.   One of the few bright spots was a reduction in inflation,to around 4.3% from 9.3% a year ago. But that was at the costof a sharp increase in unemployment and an evaporation ofhopes for an economic recovery in the second half of 1991.   Peter Roe, head of European equity research at NikkoEurope PLC, says it is probably too early to buy stocks inanticipation of economic recovery. In the short term, withrecession likely to continue, Nikko recommends defensivestocks such as BT and Cable andamp; Wireless in the communicationssector, and Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham in pharmaceuticals.   Share prices of construction, building materials andproperty investment companies were particularly hard hitduring 1991, as the recession translated into a drastic realestate slump. Helped by demand from Eastern Europe, buildingmaterials firms staged an early rally but then fell back.   Some highly publicized corporate failures, such as theInternational Leisure Group in March and Robert Maxwell'smedia empire in November, and the continuing problems ofbetting and hotels group Brent Walker PLC also took theirtoll, particularly on bank stocks.   Hanson PLC's purchase in May of a 2.8% stake in ImperialChemical Industries PLC briefly sparked a flurry ofexpectation of a takeover battle, pushing ICI stock higher.In general, however, shares of companies subject to cyclicalswings in the economy, such as chemicals, were weak. ICI fellback once it became clear that Hanson didn't intend, at leastin the near future, to pursue a takeover.   In the early spring, a flood of rights issues began toweigh heavily on the market. In September, premature signsthat Britain was finally fighting its way out of recessiondrove the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index toits peak for the year of 2683.7 on Sept. 3.   But an ill-fated rights issue from British Aerospace and aseries of Labor Party by-elections sent share prices on adownward slide for the remainder of the year.   Looking ahead, analysts see a mixed picture hinging on Mr.Major. Under British electoral rules, Mr. Major has to callan election at the latest by July.   Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New CourtSecurities PLC, says, &quot;We think the Conservatives will justabout win with a small overall majority, but it's going to bea very close call.&quot; With business failures expected to riseand unemployment continuing to grow, the economy, he says,&quot;isn't going to give them any help at all.&quot;   In the event of a Conservative victory, Morgan Stanley'sRichard Davidson says he expects the U.K. market could end1992 about 15% to 20% above current levels. If Labor wins, heexpects the gain to be about half as big, at 8% to 10%.                                                                                                          TOKYO                                                                                                          This year could be a record breaker on the Tokyo stockmarket. And that won't be a good thing.   The Nikkei average of 225 stocks ended 1991 at 22983.77.That's below the 23848.71 level on the last trading day of1990, just as 1990 was below the 1989 finish of 38915.87, therecord high. Only once before in its postwar history has theNikkei finished under its year-earlier level twice in a row,and that was in the oil price-shock recession years of 1974and 1975.   If the 1992 market also sags, Japan will have itself astock downturn in a class of its own. And many, though by nomeans all, of Tokyo's leading market analysts think that'spossible.   As most see it, the key is whether money again flows intothe market from Japanese corporations. For that to happen,they say, Japanese interest rates will have to fall further,and the government must increase spending on infrastructure.   Japan is less export-driven than in the past, and domesticdemand is now key to economic health. Stock investors grewbearish last year when Japanese companies reported a pooroutlook caused by a drop in domestic consumer demand.   Analysts also say tight money policies by the Bank ofJapan, designed to curb domestic asset inflation, and theburst of the easy money bubble, kept investors out of stocks.   Even after the central bank lowered the official discountrate by half a point July 1, and again Nov. 14 to 5%,government and private sector officials called for furthereasing of monetary policy as bankruptcies soared.   On Dec. 30, the last day the Tokyo market was open for theyear, the Bank of Japan again cut the discount rate half apercentage point, to 4.5%. Nonetheless, economists say therate will need to fall further to provide sufficient stimulusto the low-growth Japanese economy.   Domestic demand and the discount rate will continue to befactors in the direction of 1992's market. So will lastsummer's stock-market scandal, which had no parallel inJapanese financial history.                                                                                                          HONG KONG                                                                                                          Share prices roared ahead last year on falling interestrates, China's strong economy and optimism over HongKong-China relations. Further gains are anticipated thisyear.   The Hang Seng Index climbed 42.1% to finish at 4297.33.Many analysts predict the index will top 5000 in 1992. &quot;Itcould easily well exceed 5000 if the U.S. economy picks upand there are no hiccups in China,&quot; says Howard Gorges, adirector at South China Brokerage Co.   But Hong Kong's projected economic growth for 1992 is amodest 4.5% to 5.5%, and inflation remains high at about 10%.China's economy may be headed for a slowdown after a periodof robust expansion, and any U.S. trade retaliation againstChina could translate into difficulties for Hong Kong.   On the positive side, export growth is seen climbing intothe double-digit level. Corporate earnings growth isprojected to expand this year to around 20%, according toHoare Govett Asia Ltd. The stock market also is likely toreceive a boost from funds flowing out of the overheatedproperty sector in the wake of efforts to cool speculation.                                                                                                          PARIS                                                                                                          For the French stock market, &quot;1991 has been a catalog ofgreat expectations followed by disillusionment,&quot; says DavidHarrington, French equities analyst with James Capel inParis.   In June, French inflation dropped to a year-to-year rateof 3.4%, falling below German inflation for the first time in18 years. That gave the French market a new lease on life,helping to push it to a September high. But the economy'soverall sluggish performance hurt the market, adverselyaffecting consumer confidence, corporate earnings and evensome government spending plans. The economy only grew anestimated 1.4% in 1991, compared with initial governmentforecasts of 2.7% growth in gross domestic product for theyear.   The stock market is expected to do moderately well in 1992after the traditional New Year's rally, analysts say,provided that the U.S. economy chugs back into growth andGermany pulls out of its current inflationary trend.   &quot;If interest rates fall in the third quarter and theeconomy ticks up in the second half, it's quite reasonable tothink the CAC 40 will reach 2000,&quot; according to Mr.Harrington at James Capel. In 1991, the CAC 40 index rose 16%to 1765.66.                                                                                                          FRANKFURT                                                                                                          In the early run-up for German stocks, the DAX index rose24% to 1728.32 by June 6 from the beginning of the year.   And that's about when the bad news began. July taxincreases, steadily rising interest rates, a slowing Germaneconomy and global recession drained the optimism from theGerman market, erasing much of the gains made in the firsthalf of the year. Stock analysts are for the most partoptimistic that the market will improve in 1992, but theydon't expect the turnaround until late next year.   Firm German rates have caused a gravitation of fundstoward the money markets rather than equities. When ratesbegin to soften, that stockpile of funds could provide aready source of liquidity to flow back into shares.   &quot;As soon as the market senses even a mild change ofcourse&quot; from the Bundesbank, enthusiasm will be revitalized,notes Barbara Schumacher, institutional investment adviser atMerck, Finck andamp; Co.   For now, cyclical stocks such as the chemical, steel, andmachine building sectors continue to suffer from the anemicglobal economy, especially in the U.S. Certain sectors had abumpy year as Germany's post-unity boom ebbed. Auto sales,for example, surged in the first half, but dropped laterafter pent-up demand in eastern Germany was sated.   The DAX index ended at 1577.98, up 13%.                                                                                                          TORONTO                                                                                                          Canadian stocks underperformed their U.S. counterparts andeconomists say any gains in 1992 probably will be modest.   The economists cite a slow economic recovery in Canada andonly slight improvements in corporate earnings, which werehurt by the recession, a strong national currency, and weakprices for such commodities as oil and newsprint.   The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-stock Composite Indexended up 8% at 3512.36. The index jumped in February andmaintained fairly even levels throughout the year beforepeaking at 3604 on Nov. 12.   Canada's two other important stock exchanges also turnedin lackluster performances. The Montreal Exchange's MarketPortfolio Index rose 8% to 1860.43, while the Vancouver StockExchange Composite Index ended up 4% at 547.90.                                                                                                          SYDNEY                                                                                                          The stock market turned in a strong performance despite aweak domestic economy. The primary causes, lower inflationand interest rates, are expected to provide support for shareprices in 1992.   The All Ordinaries index ended at 1651.4, up 29%. Intechnical terms, the market merely made up for its 22.4%decline in 1990.   Although Australia's economic growth is expected to beamong the lowest in the Asian-Pacific region in 1992,analysts are fairly upbeat about the market's prospects. MarkNewman, senior investment manager at Wardley InvestmentServices (Hong Kong) Ltd., predicts that the index couldtouch 2050 this year, largely because of the easing monetarypolicy. In addition, Australia's corporate shakeout duringthe past decade has strengthened the market's foundation.                                                                                                          ZURICH                                                                                                          The Zurich stock market, which accounts for roughly 70% ofall Swiss stock volume, was sluggish in 1991, with pricesdown about 3%.   The outlook for 1992 is brighter. &quot;On the positive sidethere is quite a wide exposure in the Swiss market to anupturn in international trade,&quot; says Tony Aylward, aneconomist at Williams de Broe in London. Swiss companies withdollar-denominated earnings are also likely to benefit fromany rally in the U.S. currency, he adds.                                                                                                          MADRID                                                                                                          Hurt by slower economic growth, per-share earnings of thecompanies listed on the Madrid stock exchange dropped about3% in 1991, analysts say. Stronger economic growth in 1992,however, is likely to boost per-share growth to almost 7% in1992, they forecast.   The breakdown in July of talks among the government,employers and unions on a pact aimed at boostingcompetitiveness, followed by a cut in the 1991 budget, sentprices tumbling for the rest of the year.   Inflation in the first 11 months of the year fell to arate of 5.7%, compared with 6.3% in 1990, paving the way fora two-point fall in the Bank of Spain's benchmarkintervention rate to 12.5%.   Fueled by an increase in gasoline, tobacco and value addedtaxes on Jan. 1, inflation may reach 6% in 1992, analystssay. That will keep interest rates high and may hurt stocks.Depending on market conditions, the government may floatshares in 1992 in Repsol, the state-owned oil giant, andBanco Exterior, the state bank. The flotations may stirinvestor interest in the stock market.                                                                                                          TAIPEI                                                                                                          After its stunning collapse in 1990, Taipei took a neededrest in 1991. Analysts believe the nap has strengthened themarket for a mild rejuvenation this year.   The weighted price index finished the year at 4600.67, up1.6%. Analysts were pleased that the usually volatile markettraded in a fairly narrow range, fluctuating only about 3000points, compared with about 10000 points the year before.   While predicting a modest recovery, analysts caution thatany market improvement will be limited by competing demandsfor funds. A primary drain on liquidity will be the more than300 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$11.7 billion) ofconstruction bonds the government is selling to finance ahuge six-year public-works project.   Nonetheless, with Taiwan's economy steadily improving,Salomon Brothers International Ltd. is predicting that thestock market will produce 15% to 20% annual gains for thenext few years.                                                                                                          SEOUL                                                                                                          The stock market has flagged for several years as theonce-soaring South Korean economy has fallen prey to steepwage increases, high inflation and a deteriorating tradepicture.   The market's 1991 performance further disappointedinvestors as the composite index shed 12.2% to close at610.92.   Yet the foundation for a rebound is emerging: Wageincreases are slowing, inflation is easing, and the marketopens to foreign investors this year. But many analysts aredoubtful of any strong recovery. &quot;There's the temptation tobe optimistic,&quot; says Melissa Brown, senior analyst atBarclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. in Seoul. &quot;But withthe economy decelerating, fundamentals for the stock marketare still relatively weak for 1992.&quot;   Many analysts agree that the market opening will giveshare prices a boost, although attention is likely to focuson smaller stocks because foreign ownership limits havenearly been reached in many conglomerates. The drawback isthat the small shares may be difficult to sell because ofilliquidity.   Among the more upbeat projections is one from SalomonBrothers International, which predicts the index may top itsrecord of 1007 in late 1992 or sometime in 1993.                                                                                                          MILAN                                                                                                          The Italian market had one of its most depressing years onrecord as prices slumped because of poor company earnings andcontinuing political paralysis. Milan's Stock Index fell 2%to 981 in the year. The year ended with the failure byPirelli S.p.A. to woo Continental AG into a merger.   Business volume also shrank sharply as investors reactednegatively to the clumsy introduction of a capital gains taxearly in 1991, a stock fraud scandal in the summer, and aspate of broker bankruptcies in the year's last four months.   &quot;It's certainly been a very difficult year . . . butindustrial stocks are now undervalued, and even a smallupturn in the economy could lead to a big recovery inprices,&quot; says Massimo Verducci of Milan brokerage firm StudioPastorino.   Prospects for a recovery in stocks hinge partly on theoutcome of general elections in the spring, and partly on anupturn in the economy. The government is forecasting real GDPgrowth of 2.5% in 1992 after 1.4% in 1991, althoughindependent analysts such as the economic research groupPrometeia expect growth in a more modest 1.5% to 2% range.                                                                                                          BRUSSELS                                                                                                          Belgium's export-oriented economy has had such a boostfrom German demand in the past few years that it was able toshrug off high interest rates. Now, however, the German boomis slowing and interest rates remain high.   Investors cashed in on their gains from the roaring 1980sand scuttled for the safety of government bonds, offeringannual interest of around 9%. Meanwhile, analysts keptcutting their forecasts for economic growth and corporateearnings.   Kredietbank N.V. estimates that 1991 earnings for theBel-20 shares fell 8% or 9%, after dropping nearly 13% in1990. For 1992, Kredietbank sees earnings rebounding a modest7%. Alain Fonck, a fund manager at Generale de Banque S.A.,hopes for an upturn but sees no sign of it yet. &quot;You can'tcount on any miracles, at least not for the early part of theyear,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          AMSTERDAM                                                                                                          After surging in the first half, the Dutch market headedgenerally lower in choppy trading as economic growth ebbedand inflation heated up.   Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland says its weighted averageof Dutch company earnings (excluding Royal Dutch/Shell Group)fell 2% for 1991, the same drop seen a year earlier. But BZWforecasts earnings growth of 9% in 1992 and 12% in 1993. Thatforecast assumes lower interest rates by mid-1992. BZWexpects rates on long-term government bonds to fall to 7.9%by the end of 1992 from about 9% now.   Sam Van Doorn, managing director of Van Doorn Trust, saysinstitutional investors have lots of cash and may soon be inthe mood to start spending it on stocks again. &quot;We arecertainly not bearish for the new year,&quot; says Mr. Van Doorn.</TEXT></DOC>
