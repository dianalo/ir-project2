State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley complained that thedeportation move``appears to make expulsion the norm rather thanthe exception.''   ``We are shocked by the government of Israel's decision,'' Mrs.Oakley said. She stressed the numbers involved distressed the U.S.government most.   ``As a strong friend of Israel we are deeply concerned over thewidening use of expulusions,'' she said.   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press, meanwhile, thatthe United States notified Israel it would be obliged to take thisposition in conflict with Israel's if the deportation issue reachedthe United Nations.   The two governments have differed only infrequently before theworld body, where U.S. support for Israel has often rescued Israelfrom condemnation over various policies and actions.   But the sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, saidthe United States had informed Israel the dispute was harmful toU.S.-Israeli relations.   Mrs. Oakley said she was not ``speculating on the strength ofwhat we all consider to be a very strong relationship.''   The U.S. spokesman added: ``Our friendship and close associationwith Israel continues. But what we are saying is that this is anissue of concern and we've expressed these concerns to thegovernment of Israel.''   Mrs. Oakley said enforcement of the expulsion orders would meana total of 60 Palestinian Arabs were deported this year.   The statement did not specifically condemn all expulsions orquestion Israel's attempt to maintain order on the West Bank and inGaza in the face of rising unrest among the 1.5 million Palestinianinhabitants.   However, the State Department on several occasions has publiclyurged Israel not to use expulsions as a punishment for criminalacts but rather to apply the regular process of charging and tryingsuspects based on evidence.   The last such U.S. statement was made by Mrs. Oakley last Fridayeven as Israel was in the midst of moving against the Palestinians.   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead on Monday summonedDeputy Israeli Ambassador Oded Eran to the State Department toconvey U.S. unhappiness with the deportations.   Yossi Gal, the Israeli embassy spokesman, defended the policy onTuesday as a ``measure of last resort'' in dealing with agitation.   He said the expulsions were carried out ``in conformity with thelaw of the land and subject to review by the Israeli high court.''   The Israeli spokesman said the purpose was ``to try to ensurepublic safety'' and that expulsions were ordered ``only when we areconvinced it is the best way to handle the instigators andinciters'' of violence in the territories.   Despite the disagreement, Gal said on Wednesday there was ``nocrisis'' in U.S.-Israeli relations.   At least 252 Palestinian Arabs and 4 Israeli have died in thedisorders that broke out last December. Meanwhile, Secretary ofState George P. Shultz has made four trips to the region this yearto try to promote Arab-Israeli negotiations over the Palestinians.   His missions foundered over Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanianresistance to hold talks on a Middle East settlement under theterms proposed by the United States.   With Shultz on vacation, Whitehead is in charge of the StateDepartment. In his session with Eran, he ``was speaking for theU.S. government as he does in any situation like this,'' Mrs.Oakley said.</TEXT></DOC>
