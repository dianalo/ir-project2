Why does 'Eating for A's&quot; require a 12-week nutrition plan? Whyspend &quot;Twelve Days on the Road&quot; with the Sex Pistols?;   &quot;It seemed all theimportant things to say could be said in 12 chapters,&quot; says William Proctor,who wrote &quot;Twelve Keys to a Better Marriage.&quot;;   &quot;It's the hormones in thehuman body,&quot; says Alexander Schauss, the &quot;Eating for A's&quot; author. &quot;Researchshows it takes 12 weeks before the pancreas is not hyper-secreting insulin.&quot;;  &quot;I've been trying to figure out why I'm so fascinated with the number 12,&quot;says Terry Harrison, who wrote about the &quot;12 Priorities for Interdependenceand Joyful Living.&quot; &quot;I did a co-dependency program based on 12 weeks. I'mdoing a series of four books, with 36 suggestions each, 144 total, so it's a12 by 12 thing. Then last week I did a presentation on the 12 principles offamily systems. It's scary. I don't know, I was 12 when I got hair under myarms; maybe puberty has something to do with it.&quot;;   There are plenty of waysthe number pops up in daily life: The 12 months of the year, 12 days ofChristmas, 12-hour clock, 12 people on a jury, the 12 grades at school, 12inches in a foot. Not to mention a dozen eggs or doughnuts.;   &quot;You couldwrite a book on the number 12,&quot; says Brad Pethoud, a San Francisconumerologist who calls the number very significant, then launches into anintricate explanation.;   &quot;You have 1 -- the active first cause of creation,oneness, beginning,&quot; says Pethoud, &quot;and 2 -- its reverse, receptive, yielding,passive. And together they produce the offspring, 3 -- a very creative,expressive, expansive number.;   &quot;So when you see the number 12, you think ofcompletion that involves a journey, a pilgrimage, a sense of time elapsing tobring something into being. Fundamentally, 12 indicates a creative plan,program or goal that implies a duration of time, and so an earnestness. Aseriousness of intent.&quot;;   But seriously.;   &quot;Twelve says, 'This must beaccurate,' &quot; says David Snively, manager of Printers Inc. bookstore in PaloAlto, which has a whole section devoted to 12-step books. &quot;If you have a jarof beans and someone says there are 250 in it, it sounds like a guess. But ifthey say there are 253, it sounds like wow, they know something.&quot;;   RoseCarrano, of HarperCollins publishers in New York, says putting 12 on a bookcover means more people are going to pick up the book.;   &quot;It's measurable.Doable,&quot; she says. &quot;The concepts are graspable, and you're not wasting yourmoney.&quot;;   Division by 12 assures a reader that a project can be completed. Italso says it won't be too complex -- it's been cut up into 12 little bits. Andit promises fast results.;   &quot;If you can grasp the concept in a short time,you can apply it to your life right away,&quot; Carrano says. &quot;I think that's whatpeople want more than anything. People are really searching.&quot;;   All of whichstarts to explain why so many 12 books are aimed at self-improvement: A bookof brain exercises that'll make you smarter in 12 weeks. A 12-day nutritionprogram that will help you eke every last bit of vigor out of your body.Twelve rules for getting rich.;   Still not convinced?

Then cameco-dependency groups for those who love those addicts. And now here's Beattie,combining the two and hitting on practically every self-help trend of the pastdecade.
