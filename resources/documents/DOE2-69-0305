<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-69-0305 </DOCNO><TEXT>The atmosphere, biosphere and ocean surface layers contain approximatelyequal amounts of carbon (the deep ocean contains over 50 times as much).The flux of carbon between these pools is dominated by the process ofphotosynthesis which is itself influenced by the CO{sub 2} concentrationof the atmosphere. Over the last 200 years deforestation and now fossilfuel combustion have added CO{sub 2} to the atmosphere to increase theconcentration by 27% - half the increase occurred over the last 30 years.The resulting greenhouse effect has been accomanied by an increase inthe global average temperature of about 0.5 degrees; other greenhousegases (N{sub 2}O, O{sub 3}, CFCs, CH{sub 4}) are also contributing tothe warming. Present uncertainties with estimating carbon flows resultfrom the disputed contribution of deforestation, the level of increasedplant productivity and carbon storage due to CO{sub 2} fertilization,and problems with estimating net primary production. Uncertainties inestimating future carbon balances arise from the extent of fossil fueluse especially by USA, USSR and China, the degree of control of greenhousegas emissions, the CO{sub 2} fertilization effect on plant productivityand vegetation responses (including moisture availability) and the rateof change of the climatic factors resulting from changing carbon fluxes.46 refs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
