O'BoyleStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROPMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> BONN, West Germany </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year ago, economists were predicting a West German boom that would propel West Europe to its best economic performance since the 1970s. It never materialized and today, Europe's economic engine is running out of steam.    No one is forecasting a recession in Germany. But it is likely that its economy won't expand this year at even the modest 2% rate forecast only a few months ago -- and that it will actually decline in the current quarter.    The slowdown is casting a shadow over the globe. Germany accounts for one-fourth of the output of the 12-nation European Community, so its weakness is sapping the continent of economic vitality.    Despite strength in Britain and Italy, Common Market growth is expected to sag to 2% this year from the 3.5% annual rate in 1986's second half. The sluggishness is depriving the U.S. of the surge in European imports it needs to narrow its trade deficit, and is dimming hopes for an easing of the world debt crisis.    The Reagan administration is still urging Bonn to revive its economy. It argues that because Germany has the smallest budget deficits, the lowest inflation and the largest economy in Europe, it is in the best position to stimulate growth.    The Germans have agreed to add about $3 billion to an existing $5 billion tax-cut package, which takes effect next January. But so far they haven't shown any inclination to take the stronger action demanded by Washington and some European trading partners.    Yet evidence is mounting that Europe's economic motor has fallen out of the car. The Bundesbank recently reported, for example, that domestic manufacturing orders fell an unusually sharp 4% in January from the previous month.    &quot;The latest signs are quite disturbing,&quot; says Klaus Friedrich, an economist specializing in German affairs at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. He adds that the &quot;weakness is from a base that was already meager.&quot;    Economist J. Paul Horne of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in Paris, finds the evidence equally troubling. &quot;The West German economy is very vulnerable,&quot; he says. If the Germans &quot;let things go as they are, then a further weakening of the dollar could move them dangerously toward zero growth.&quot;    Instead of &quot;dithering,&quot; Mr. Horne adds, &quot;the German government would be well advised to step on the gas a little bit.&quot;    Germany's inflation-adjusted growth of 2.4% last year was its worst showing since the economy climbed out of recession in 1983. Experts project a slack 1%-to-2% gain for all of 1987 -- and a contraction of as much as 1% in the first quarter.    Initially, they had figured that domestic demand, benefiting from lower oil prices, would fill the economic void left by diminishing exports. That happened, to some extent. But what the economists didn't foresee was the precipitous decline in the dollar and the dramatic impact that would have on the German economy. Because Germany depends on exports for one-third of its economy, the impact of a slowdown in trade is profound. Export volume grew less than 1% last year, compared with a 6% increase in 1985.    As exports shrivel, German businesses are becoming pessimistic and cautious, lowering production and inventories.    German business is also scaling back investment, which until recently had reached record levels. Capital spending by German firms this year is expected to run only slightly ahead of 1986 levels, after gains of 9% in 1985 and 5% last year. &quot;German exporters have stopped buying capital goods,&quot; says the Fed's Mr. Friedrich.    Some big companies anticipate outright declines. Siemens AG, the electronics giant that makes half of its $25 billion annual sales outside Germany, says it intends to cut capital outlays about 3% this year. The decision follows three years in which annual spending more than tripled to $3.4 billion.    &quot;Things are slowing down,&quot; says one Siemens official. &quot;The business climate just isn't as favorable as it was.&quot;    His sentiment is widespread. Last month IFO, the Munich-based economic research institute, recorded its steepest decline in German business confidence in more than three years.    Germany's manufacturing sector also faces possible labor unrest. Bargaining with IG Metall, the powerful union that represents more than three million workers in the automobile and metal-working industries, is expected to be contentious as negotiators work to reach a new contract in the next few months. The union's walkout in 1984 crippled the West German economy.    But the biggest potential shock could come from further weakness in the dollar. The U.S. currency has firmed since the meeting of finance ministers in Paris last month and is trading in a narrow range of about 1.85 marks. The threat of central bank intervention could prevent sharp deviation from that level.    If the dollar doesn't remain stable -- if it weakens to 1.75 marks or even lower -- trade would contract even further and a recession might then become imminent, economists fear.    The strong mark, meanwhile, is a double-edged detriment to the German economy: Not only does it make German exports more expensive, it also forces some businesses to expand activities outside Germany, where costs are lower.    Ford of Europe Inc., for instance, is building new engines at its plant in Britain rather than sticking with plans to make them at a factory in Germany. The 26% appreciation of the mark against the British pound in the past two years means that British production offers a $50, or 10%, cost advantage on each engine.    &quot;Britain is definitely more competitive,&quot; says William Hayden, Ford's vice president of manufacturing, who expects the current relationship between the pound and the mark to hold for a few years. </TEXT></DOC>
