City leaders,who set up a panel to investigate the shooting blamed for two nightsof racial rioting, expressed hope that the worst was over.   ``It's really quiet,'' police spokesman David Rivero said today.``We still have a perimeter around Overtown, about a two-square milearea. We're just letting in residents or people who belong there.Liberty City is completely open _ nothing happened there lastnight.''   He said police made about 30 arrests Wednesday night and earlytoday, making it a night of marked contrast to Tuesday, when 325youths were taken into custody, most for looting.   ``There's nothing left to loot in there, and they've already shotout most of the street lights,'' said Coral Gables police Sgt. WayneHarris. He was part of a 26-man force assembled to sweep theadjacent Coconut Grove neighborhood on Miami's south side afterseven or eight gunshots were heard and two Molotov cocktails weretossed into roadways.   The sweep was called off, however, because the area quieted.   A few highway exit ramps remained blocked, and parts of Miamiwere still cordoned off at night.   In the Liberty City area on the city's north side, policereceived reports of car fires, smashed store windows, a minor fireat a fast-food restaurant and some rock- and bottle-throwing.   And in the Overtown section just north of downtown, where theriots began Monday night, a police ``field force'' took time for boxlunches and television viewing on the hoods of squad cars.   City commissioners, meeting in emergency session Wednesday,appointed a panel with subpoena power to investigate the fatalshooting of an unarmed, 23-year-old black motorcyclist by a Hispanicpoliceman. And the sister of the motorcyclist's passenger, who diedafter the vehicle crashed, made a televised appeal for an end to theviolence.   ``Put down your weapons _ I do not want my brother to beremembered with the riots,'' Claudia Lubrin said on local television.   The rioting that followed the killing has left one person dead,eight shot, 13 buildings burned and numerous others looted in theblack neighborhoods. In addition about 10-15 cars were burned.   Fire investigators have found the damage in the riot areas to beless than first expected, said Christy LeMay, a Miami firedepartment spokeswoman. Seven of the burned buildings were abandonedand in some cases already destroyed.   The rioting also has left image-conscious city officialsscrambling to minimize the impact on Sunday's Super Bowl. TheCincinnati Bengals remained at their downtown hotel, just blocksfrom the Overtown disturbances.   ``What has happened the last two days has certainly taken theglitter off the Super Bowl,'' said Dick Anderson, a former MiamiDolphin player and chairman of a host city committee spending $2million this week to enhance Miami's image.   ``That's really what life is over there,'' said Bengalsquarterback Boomer Esiason. ``It really puts this game inperspective.''   Police deployed about 450 officers, and worked to meet sporadicoutbreaks of violence with shows of force. ``Field forces'' ofofficers clad in bullet-proof vests and riot gear were stationed onthe edge of the riot-torn neighborhoods. Caravans of squad carsraced through the areas, and SWAT teams searched for troublemakers.   ``We hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling,''said Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez. ``We don't like being outhere 12 hours and being shot at.''   Speaking at the city commission meeting, Mayor Xavier Suarezapologized to police ``for actions that may have endangered theirlives unduly.''   Suarez didn't elaborate at the meeting, but he told The New YorkTimes that he may have erred when he allowed the sister of the deadmotorcyclist to view her brother's body shortly after he was shotMonday night, the Times reported today. He said her reactionappeared to incite a group of nearby youths, who showered policewith bottles.   ``I took the sister over to the deceased,'' Suarez said. ``Ishould have done that under more controlled circumstances. All thekids followed me. Things got out of hand. I don't believe what I didwas the trigger. In fact, I may have helped for a while by goingthere and talking to people. But I would have done it differently ifI had it to do all over again.''   The Times said Suarez later called to say that he had notintended those comments for publication.   Black leaders warned Suarez before the commission meetingWednesday that their community would no longer accept empty promisesand business as usual.   ``The word is out that there will be more disturbance,'' said theRev. William Washington. ``Now we've got to act and act quick.''   Commissioners unanimously approved the special panel toinvestigate the shooting of Clement Lloyd, who was speeding with afriend, Allen Blanchard, through Overtown. Blanchard died in ahospital Tuesday of injuries from the motorcycle crash.   After discussions, the commissioners approved a suggestion byMiller Dawkins, the lone black on the five-member commission, whowanted a board consisting of five policemen and five Overtownresidents, with the mayor as chairman.   Dawkins said the board will not satisfy the young people throwingrocks and bottles, and he appealed to them for time.   ``I'd like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out, andto work on all our other ills, such as poor housing, poor education,joblessness,'' he said. ``And they have to work with us instead ofcreating other problems like they are doing now.''   The FBI, the State Attorney's Office and the police internalreview board are also investigating the police shooting. WilliamLozano, 29, the Colombian-born police officer who shot themotorcyclist in the head, was relieved of duty with pay pending theinvestigation.   Police Chief Perry Anderson said in an interview on ABC's``Nightline'' that his department had ``major concerns'' about theshooting.   ``There seem to be some unusual circumstances,'' the police chiefsaid.   Most schools that closed Tuesday reopened, although attendancewas down.   Liberty City was the site of a 1980 race riot also linked to thedeath of a black motorcylist at the hands of white police officers.The 1980 uprising left 18 people dead. In 1982, a riot in Overtownsparked by a police shooting caused millions of dollars of damage tobusinesses and buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
