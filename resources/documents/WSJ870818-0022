He said he told his law clerk late yesterday afternoon to inform interested parties of his decision.    The unusual action would appear to be a major setback for financier Victor Posner, Miami-based Sharon's chairman and chief executive officer. Herbert P. Minkel Jr., an attorney for the creditors committee, said that the creditors will file a plan that would wipe out Mr. Posner's equity in Sharon. &quot;Posner won't have anything,&quot; he said.    Citing labor problems and efforts to raise money to construct a new blast furnace, Sharon, which has the bulk of its operations in Farrell, Pa., had asked the court for an additional six months in which to file an exclusive bankruptcy-reorganization plan. For a limited period of time after filing for protection from creditors, the debtor company enjoys the sole right to file a reorganization plan; Sharon's time period expired Saturday.    The creditors committee had opposed the extension of time on the grounds that resolution of those two situations wouldn't substantially alter whatever plan Sharon eventually filed. Judge Bentz declined to discuss his reasons for deciding against Sharon.    A representative of Mr. Posner lashed out at the decision. Charles Nolan, vice president of Sharon and several other Posner-controlled concerns, said the action &quot;can only damage Sharon Steel, its work force, the community, (and) the overwhelming majority of creditors and stockholders.&quot; Ultimately, he said, it would even hurt &quot;the few creditors who would obstruct Sharon's reorganization.&quot;    Mr. Nolan said Sharon was &quot;forced&quot; into Chapter 11 by &quot;the impulsiveness of a small number of the creditors.&quot; Despite the current situation, he added, Sharon has received &quot;commitments of approximately $100 million for capital infusions that would ensure the survival and ultimately the profitability&quot; of the company.    Sharon, the nation's 12th-largest steelmaker, sought bankruptcy-law protection from creditors in April, filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, in which a company continues to operate while it works out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
