ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once again Democrats are out in the cold onInauguration Day, spectators as a Republican takes office aspresident. But like George Bush, the Democrats are developing aspecial fondness for Martin Van Buren.   In his first news conference as president-elect, Bush expressedhis gratitude to President Reagan and then said, ``I also want tothank Martin Van Buren for paving the way. It's been a long time,Marty.''   Not since Van Buren's election in 1836 had an incumbent vicepresident succeeded in winning the White House.   But the Democrats like the second half of the Van Buren story: hewas a one-term president, defeated when he ran for re-election in1840.   As usual, there is a bumper crop of politicians hoping to be thestar at a Democratic celebration next Inauguration Day.   Start with familiar names from the 1988 campaign _ MichaelDukakis, Jesse Jackson, Lloyd Bentsen, Albert Gore Jr., RichardGephardt. All are regarded as likely contenders when the 1992campaign gets rolling.   Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia refusedto run in 1988, but may not be so reticent the next time around. Thesame goes for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York is a name sure to come up inconnection with 1992. And would the early stages of presidentialspeculation be complete without mention of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy?   What about a woman? Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado was tempted tojoin the 1988 field, but decided against it. She has a book comingout in February and plans to do a lot of traveling to promote it.   Long shots? The Senate is filled with them. Sen. George Mitchellof Maine was no sooner elected majority leader than whispers begansuggesting he'd be an impressive presidential candidate. Newlyelected Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska also was being mentioned evenbefore moving to Washington. The same was true of Sen. Charles Robbof Virginia.   And somewhere out there in America is a senator, congressman,governor or businessman whose name will come up a year or two fromnow, touted as the candidate who could break the Republican hold onthe White House.   Trips to Iowa, site of the first Democratic presidentialcaucuses, are a good sign of whether a politician has White Housefever.   Former professional basketball star Bradley made a guestappearance early this year at a college basketball tournament inIowa.   It's a good bet that Democratic legislative candidates in Iowawill have all the big-name help they want in the 1990 campaign.   Several of the most prominent prospects for 1992 have re-electioncampaigns in 1990. They include Bradley, Gore, Nunn, Cuomo, Clinton,Gephardt and Schroeder.   Dukakis, the defeated 1988 presidential nominee, recentlyannounced he would not seek another term as governor ofMassachusetts in 1990, a decision he said ``has nothing to do withnational office.''   But, Dukakis also said one of the lessons he had learned in 1988was that ``it is very difficult to run for the presidency as anincumbent governor.''   Texas Sen. Bentsen impressed many voters with his performance asthe Democratic vice presidential nominee and that seems likely tomerit him mention for 1992. But Bentsen will turn 71 on Feb. 11,1992.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donald M. Rothberg is the chief political writerfor The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
