The dissident group, the Midwest Stock Exchange Members Association, claims that procedural and other steps taken by the exchange leading up to the election discriminate against a slate of board nominees the members association is backing.    The members group filed a motion Friday in Cook County circuit court seeking a preliminary injunction to delay the election. Jerome H. Torshen, an attorney for the members, said a hearing on the motion has been set for Thursday.    The dissidents include about 50 exchange floor brokers and market-makers, known as specialists. They are backing their eight board nominees, and they oppose the slate nominated by exchange management, to protest exchange practices that they claim hurt their business. The exchange has 444 members.    Even if the group's nominees are elected, they will hold only eight out of 24 board seats. Cary Grant, an exchange specialist and dissident board nominee, said, &quot;We're not trying to unseat management. But they certainly need some input.&quot;    The dissident group's grievances, according to court filings, include: fees higher than those charged by other exchanges; the exchange's decision to give the right to trade over-the-counter stocks to only three specialists; reassignment of stocks among specialists for non-disciplinary reasons; a rate structure that charges higher fees for small orders than large ones; undisclosed salaries for officers; and inadequate marketing.    Alton B. Harris, an attorney for the exchange, said that its election procedures have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and are in accordance with Illinois and Delaware state law. The exchange is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation.    The group's complaint maintains that election materials sent to members were &quot;unfair and biased&quot; against their nominees. It also says that by not holding an annual meeting at the time of the election, the exchange deprives members of an open forum to discuss the nominees. </TEXT></DOC>
