(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, wrapping up afour-day island vacation today, will travel to Washington onWednesday to discuss with Senate Democrats his selection of a vicepresidential candidate and other issues.   Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan said the Massachusettsgovernor had decided to delay by one day a scheduled campaign tripthrough the Midwest in order to spend Wednesday in private meetingson Capitol Hill.   The meetings were announced as the Dukakis campaign signaled itsintention to unveil the running mate choice before the DemocraticNational Convention begins on July 18.   A report in today's Boston Herald quoted a campaign source assaying the decision may be announced by July 4.   Gearan said no decision had been made on when a selection wouldbe made or announced.   ``I think it's much too early in the process to make anydetermination like that,'' Gearan said.   He said Dukakis would meet privately with 20 to 30 or perhapsmore Senate Democrats, individually or in groups, and would arrangea meeting with House members at a later time. He said the vicepresidency would be among the topics.   Dukakis was winding down a four-day holiday in Nantucket andfinding out that likely presidential nominees don't really get away_ even on a getaway.   Dukakis was accompanied on the trip by only a few aides but alarge group of Secret Service bodyguards and a large contingent ofreporters, photographers and television crews.   Speaking with the journalists Friday in the yard of his borrowedvacation home, Dukakis noted the presence of the hefty entourage.   ``These days, strolling around isn't what it used to be,'' hesaid a bit wistfully.   The Massachusetts governor and his wife were leaving thisNantucket Island resort off Cape Cod tonight.   The weather was too cool for the Dukakises to visit the beachduring their break from the presidential campaign. Rain andthunderstorms moved inSunday and kept them inside the house, wherepress secretary Mark Gearan said Dukakis ate seafood, read andrelaxed.   ``He's just been relaxing this afternoon,'' Gearan said Sundayat a briefing for journalists accompanying the candidate to theisland.   Gearan said Dukakis steered clear of major work on his next bigdecision, selecting a running mate.   He said the Massachusetts governor did not even talk bytelephone with aides in Denver, where the Dukakis campaignsucceeded in winning a proposed platform document free of calls forhigher taxes and a defense budget freeze sought by rival JesseJackson.   While the party platform action was taken amid signals of partyunity, and displayed Dukakis' strength in controlling the platformissue, Gearan made no claim that the Democratic National Conventionin Atlanta next month would be free of floor battles over theplatform.   ``We have a good working relationship with Jackson's campaign,and things are going well,'' Gearan said.   But he added, ``I think he's said all along there could verywell be some floor fights at the convention.''   Gearan responded to comments by Vice President George Bush, thecertain Republican nominee, who has criticized Massachusetts'prison furlough program and stepped up his charges last week bysaying drug dealers were being released on weekend passes.   Gearan said a 1983 state law signed by Dukakis imposed mandatorysentences for drug dealers that prohibits furlough releases.   Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, who is wearing a neck brace whileshe recovers from spinal surgery, took walks around the area beforethe rain came and they slipped into the village of Nantucket fordinner at a fashionable restaurant Saturday night.   Dukakis and his wife are staying at the Colonial-style home oflongtime friends Bernard and Grace Grossman, situated on awell-manicured hillside overlooking the water.   They took most of their meals at their hosts' table, where Mrs.Grossman served shrimp and prepared homemade apple pie and peachmuffins.   The Dukakis' daughter Kara joined them with a college friend forbreakfast Sunday morning. Mrs. Dukakis went into town shopping withher daughter and Grace Grossman while Dukakis read the Sundaynewspapers.   Dukakis, known for being budget-conscious in his personalhabits, said on arriving he had no plans for shopping, ``Not a bitof it.'' Mrs. Dukakis, who likes to shop while on campaign trips,leaned over and said, ``We haven't discussed it.''   Dukakis was returning to Boston on a commercial commuter flightMonday night and planned to be back in his Statehouse officesTuesday. Mrs. Dukakis was traveling to nearby Martha's Vineyard,another island off Cape Cod, for several days of relaxing, whileDukakis plans a three-day campaign trip through six Midwesternstates.</TEXT></DOC>
