Tl-201 myocardial imaging and cardiacX-ray CT were performed nearly simultaneously about one month postoperatively.Cardiac imaging using IADSA was performed at a rate of 30 frames/secwith matrix size of 512 x 256. Time density curves of each pixel in theregion of the myocardium of the left ventricle were post-processed toobtain functional images. The maximal concentration (Cmax), integrationof the time-density curve (Cinteg), mean transit time (MTT), Cmax/MTTand Cinteg/MTT were computed for each pixel. Cmax and Cinteg are parametersrelated to the volume of the coronary vascular bed. Cmax/MTT and Cinteg/MTTare parameters related to the regional myocardial blood flow. These functionalimages showed hypoperfusion areas in 35 of 37 ischemic segments confirmedby wall motion in digital subtraction left ventriculography, Tl-201 myocardialimaging and ECG. Normal perfusion areas of the functional images wereobserved in 18 of 54 infarcted segments. These results show the complexitiesof myocardial perfusion in old myocardial infarction.</TEXT></DOC>
