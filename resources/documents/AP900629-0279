On other commodity markets, silver futures also advanced;soybeans surged while grain futures were mixed; livestock and meatfutures were mostly lower; and energy futures slipped.   Gold futures rose $5.80 to $5.90 in New York with the contractfor delivery in August settling at $359.90 a troy ounce. The thinlytraded July contract ended at $357.90.   It was gold's most muscular rally since April 6, when futuresprices jumped $5.90 across the board.   Silver futures settled 7.1 cents to 7.8 cents higher Friday onthe Commodity Exchange with July at $4.887 a troy ounce.   Analysts said the rally partly reflected trade buying to securesupplies ahead of a threatened general strike next week in SouthAfrica and a threatened Soviet miners strike a week later.   Further buying interest was stirred when the August topped $356,triggering a wave of technically inspired buy orders.   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,said South African gold miners were unlikely to join the threatenedgeneral strike in large numbers because union participation is notstrong among mine worker there.   He also saw the Soviet strike threat as weak but said goldprices could advance another $5 on technical factors, especially ifthe dollar continues to weaken against other major currencies.   Soybean futures climbed sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade inthe wake of a report in which the Agriculture Departmentunexpectedly reduced its estimate of planted soybean acreage.   Corn futures ended narrowly mixed while most wheat futuresretreated.   In a report released after Thursday's close, the USDA peggedsoybean plantings at 58 million acres, about 1.4 million acresbelow the agency's March projection and 1.6 million below tradeexpectations.   The USDA also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200,000 acresto a higher-than-expected 74.6 million, reflecting planting delayscaused by heavy spring rains in the Midwest.   Many analysts had expected the USDA to report a correspondingincrease in soybean acres, confirming trade perceptions thatfarmers unable to plant corn had switched to soybeans.   The soybean rally also reflected some private forecasters'predictions that hot, dry weather will move into the Corn Belt latenext week.   But in a six-to-10-day forecast released late Friday, theNational Weather Service predicted normal to above-normal rainfallin the Midwest July 5-9.   Wheat futures settled 4{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher withJuly at $3.25} a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to } centhigher with July at $2.95{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to { centlower with July at $1.35{ a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 19cents higher with July at $6.23{ a bushel.   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower ahead of theUSDA's quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory, which was released afterthe close.   The report showed 54.4 million hogs and pigs in the UnitedStates as of June 1, 3 percent less than on the same date a yearago. The number was near expectations and was expected to havelittle effect on futures prices Monday.   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent lower to .13 cent higherwith August at 73.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to.35 cent lower with August at 84.02 cents a pound; live hogs were.37 cent lower to .20 cent higher with July at 60.40 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .97 cent to 1.55 cents lower with July at58.20 cents a pound.   Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York MercantileExchange after an attempted rally failed to gather momentum in thintrading.   The July gasoline contract bucked the trend, though, and closedsharply higher.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 8 cents to 23 centslower with August at $17.07 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to.79 cent lower with July at 48.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .60 cent lower to 1.65 cents higher with July at 62.58 cents agallon.</TEXT></DOC>
