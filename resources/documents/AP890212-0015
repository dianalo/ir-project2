Jerry Brown began what he saidcould be a political comeback Saturday night by winning thepreviously obscure California Democratic Party chair.   Brown defeated Steve Westly, a party official unknown to thegeneral public, 1,554-762, in voting by some 2,300 delegates at theparty's annual convention.   Brown's bid to return to the public arena overshadowed otherevents at the convention, including speeches by most of the majorcontenders for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1990 andthe addresses of 1988 presidential hopefuls Richard Gephardt andJesse Jackson.   The two-time candidate for president picked the race as thevehicle to end the six-year, self-imposed political exile whichbegan after he concluded his two terms as governor with a losingcampaign for the U.S. Senate.   Brown, 50, once dubbed ``Gov. Moonbeam'' by his critics, spentpart of that exile in seclusion writing in Mexico and Japan, partworking Mother Teresa's hospital in Calcutta, India, and part on aCARE hunger project in Bangladesh.   Brown readily confirmed Friday that if he won the chair's office,he would probably seek higher offices in the future. But if he lostit would be the most embarrassing, and possibly the final, loss ofhis public career.   Brown said he was confident of victory in Saturday's vote. Buthis opponent, current vice chair Westly of Menlo Park, said hesurveyed more than half of the voting delegates and found Brownleading by only 556 to 525 with 585 undecided.   In speeches to the delegates Saturday, Brown promised ``tomobilize the millions and millions of non-voters'' to rejoin thepolitical process.   ``You will not see my face on the cover of Time magazine,''Westly, 33, an investment banker and longtime party volunteer, toldthe delegates. ``But I have a different strength. I get the jobdone.''   Brown wrapped up a three-month campaign for the post withendorsements from most of the state's most prominent Democraticpoliticians, including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, Assembly SpeakerWillie Brown and state Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti.   But at least two dozen Democratic officeholders and countychairmen publicly opposed Brown, contending that his presence asofficial head of the party would breathe new life into Republicanattacks against the most controversial events of his governship from1975 through 1982 and be a liability for Democratic candidates in1990.   The bid for the obscure post of party chair by a former governorwas unprecedented in California politics, and it overshadowed allother business of the three-day Democratic State Convention thatstarted Friday.   In an appearance Friday before the Sacramento Press Club, Browndescribed his $150,000 campaign as his re-entry into politics and apossible stepping stone back to higher office. But he repeated hispledge that if elected he wouldn't seek any higher office until histerm as chair is completed.   ``I'm not running for anything in the next four years,'' Brownsaid, adding that ``obviously, I don't intend it to be my terminalposition (in politics). But where I go next, or where I'm invited togo next, will depend completely on the success of what I've embarkedupon here.''   Brown said that as chairman he would devote his full attention toparty fund-raising, building local committees and clubs and partyregistration and get-out-the-the vote drives.   He conceded that he often ignored the party while governor, andthat the ``nuts-and-bolts'' administrative duties of state chair areexactly the things he tended to neglect as governor. But he said hispriorities are different now.   ``There has been a lot of discussion about my administrativeability. I've thought a lot about that over the last six years, andit's true ... a good manager (requires) doing things in a verystructured manner, which is certainly not my natural inclination.''   He said changes in state laws giving the party more influence andthe need to reverse declining voter participation trends torevitalize the Democratic Party all make the chair's job moreimportant and challenging.  </TEXT></DOC>
