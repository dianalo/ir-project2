Founded in 1910 as the Indian Protection Service, it changed toFUNAI in 1967 after allegations that federal agents deliberatelyinfected Indians with measles, smallpox and influenza. Indismantling the original agency, the attorney general charged itwas ``a den of corruption and indiscriminate killings.''   Early this year, Juca was convicted in one Amazon state and isunder investigation in three others for signing illegal contractswith about 50 lumber companies last September and allowing them tocut wood in Indian reserves. He faces only a fine, to be set later.   Juca did not respond when asked about the investigation. He saidthat under his administration, ``We have recuperated the image ofFUNAI.''   ``It wasn't that the agency had a policy to kill. It wascarelessness and ignorance,'' he says.   Juca claims that under him, 74 million acres were demarcated forIndian reservations _ more than double the 30 million acresreserved from 1910 to 1985.   But critics say FUNAI is counting land that merely has beenidentified as having Indians on it or was already in the process ofbeing demarcated when Juca took over.   ``He's just lying. But even when FUNAI demarcates land, theIndians don't know anything about it,'' says Osvaldo da Cunha, aformer FUNAI physician who coordinated the agency's health programsfor 10 years. ``Basically it's a way to reserve an area so it canlater be commercially developed by whoever pays the most. I quitlast year in utter frustration, anger and anguish.''   Reports of violent clashes between isolated Indians and farmersand miners are common. When word surfaced last year that itinerantgold miners shot to death five Yanomami Indians, it created aninternational furor.   The Yanomamis are the largest primitive tribe in existence,numbering about 10,000 in the remote northern territory of Roraimawhich borders Venezuela.   Backed by the military, FUNAI sent helicopters to remove thegold miners and in the process yanked out a group of doctors,anthropologists and missionaries who were working with theYanomamis.   The Commission to Create the Yanomami Park, as the group iscalled, has not been allowed back in the area. But some 60,000 goldexplorers remain and the government hasn't taken any action tothrow them out.   The government charged that the commission, funded byinternational organizations such as the Denmark-based InternationalWork Group for Indigenous Affairs, was a front for a foreign plotto create another nation. Even Roraima's Bishop Aldo Mongiano wasejected and accused of panning for gold to send to his native Italy.   A reporter who asked repeatedly to visit the region was told byFUNAI it was ``unsafe.''   ``It's unbelievable. We had a good health program and theYanomamis were slowly becoming aware of the reality around them,''said the group's coordinator, Carlos Zacquini. ``Now, the Indiansare living in a concentration camp and they're dying of malaria,tuberculosis. But we can't do anything because only FUNAI and themilitary are allowed in.''   Last month, Juca said FUNAI demarcated 5 million acres for theYanomamis by naming the zone a ``national forest.'' In reality, theYanomamis' habitat was reduced by 75 percent, the tribe's four maingroups were divided into 19, and under the national forest categorytheir land can be commercially exploited.   In September, Juca was named as the new governor of Roraima andthat has some anthropologists worried.   ``Well, that will take care of the Yanomamis,'' saidanthropologist Alcida Ramos, a professor at the University ofBrasilia whom FUNAI denied permission to re-enter the region tocontinue work started 10 years ago.   For now, Indians look to the new constitution as their hope forretaining their cultures.   The charter includes some of the most generous Indian laws inBrazil's history.   ``It's very nice on paper, but the question is how _ or if _ thelaw will be applied and by whom,'' Krenak says. ``We have a lot ofwork ahead because up to now the government lacked interest.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 6</NOTE></DOC>
