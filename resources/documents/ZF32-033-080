OskiandM;AppleTalk Remote Access, the upcoming Apple software that will let users dialinto AppleTalk networks, will meet a long-standing need for individual users,but it is also a tool whose impact no network manager will be able to ignore.andM;We examined a prerelease copy of the software, which will be announced atNetWorld '91 in Dallas this week.andP;  The software will be included with Apple'sforthcoming PowerBook notebook computers and will be available separately for$199.andM;What it does.andP;  AppleTalk Remote Access allows one Mac to call another andaccess its files and services.andP;  Connections can be restricted to just the&quot;host&quot; Mac -- the one you are calling -- or to the AppleTalk network on whichit resides.andM;Unlike similar products from both Farallon Computing Inc. and Shiva Corp.andO;(see story, Page 24), AppleTalk Remote Access does not allow users to linktwo entire networks together.andP;  Services on the remote network are accessibleonly to the Mac that initiates the Remote Access connection.andM;System 7.0 integration.andP;  AppleTalk Remote Access will require System 7.0.andO;Apple also recommends 4 Mbytes of RAM, although 2 Mbytes should work.andM;Once installed, configuration through a control panel is easy.andP;  The RemoteAccess application, used to initiate a connection, also can be used toconfigure the product.andM;Using the control panel, you can turn call answering on or off, specify themaximum length of any connection, set access to just the host or the entirenetwork, and specify the type of modem attached to your modem or printerport.andM;Apple will support an extensive list of both 2,400-bps/V.22bis and9,600-bps/V.32 modems in the software.andP;  Users also will be able to writeinitialization and control scripts for other modems in CCL (Command ControlLanguage), described in separate documents that will be available throughAPDA.andM;Access control.andP;  In some ways, AppleTalk Remote Access operates as a naturalextension to current system software.andP;  Client access is controlled with thesame User andamp; Groups control panel used in System 7.0's file sharing.andO;Installing AppleTalk Remote Access adds options to users' configurationpanels.andP;  Each user, except Guest, can be allowed to call in, and, optionally,can have a call-back number assigned.andP;  The call-back option offers bettersecurity and allows the host side to absorb most of the costs of theconnection.andP;  It will be great for workers at home but not as useful forportable users on the road.andM;To help managers maintain control over access to their networks, Apple hascreated a utility that requires a password before allowing users to set uptheir Macs for dial-in callers.andP;  This utility should be available separatelythrough APDA.andM;Users can check a connection activity log on each host Mac to monitor access,including caller's name and connection duration.andP;  The log also can be set torecord unauthorized log-in attempts.andM;Just like being there?andP;  Remote connections are based on connection documents.andO;The document specifies your user name, password and the phone number you wantto dial.andP;  You can save your password to simplify connections if you wish.andO;Remote Access also can be configured to periodically remind you that you areconnected.andM;Connections also can be initiated in three other ways: You can drag and dropa connection document on the Remote Access application icon; hold down theOption key and double-click on a connection document; or double-click on analias of a file, folder or volume from the remote host Mac.andM;Unlike some competing products, AppleTalk Remote Access is designed to letusers access both local and remote resources.andP;  But to resolve networkconflicts when calling from one network-based Mac to another, users have toturn that capability off.andP;  Apple provides an object in the Network controlpanel that allows you to set your network to Remote Only.andM;Preliminary tests using a prerelease version of AppleTalk Remote Accessdemonstrated equal or better performance than other products, but there's aprice: The Chooser is not updated after you make the initial connection.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Managers may find it hard to justify the cost of a modem onevery desk, not to mention the security risks.andP;  Still, AppleTalk RemoteAccess promises to be a popular product with users.andM;Shiva and Cayman Systems Inc. this week will announce stand-alone, multilinededicated AppleTalk Remote Access servers designed to address both securityand cost concerns.andM;As an extension of system software and as a personal productivity tool,Remote Access dovetails nicely with the file-sharing features offered inSystem 7.0, and allows you to access network services, especially file printand mail servers, from remote locations.andM;Users who need to dial into an AppleTalk network from home or from the roadcan choose from a number of third-party products that usually offer dial-inas a bonus to other services.andM;andgt;PhoneNET PhoPhoLiaison  from Farallon Computing Inc. of Emeryville, Calif.,andO;is a $395 software router that lets users dial into a Mac and thereby accessa node, zone or entire network.andP;  Each user can be given a different passwordand call-back identification, similar to Apple's implementation in RemoteAccess.andM;But Farallon's product is mainly a network router.andP;  Liaison allows you tointernetwork up to five different AppleTalk LANs whether they are LocalTalk,token-ring or Ethernet.andP;  Using Liaison you also can connect remote networksasynchronously or allow stand-alone users to dial in and access services onthe network.andM;andgt;NetModem/E from Cambridge, Mass.-based Shiva Corp. is one of a series ofShiva devices that lets Mac users dial into AppleTalk networks without hostMacs.andP;  The $2,249 NetModem/E won't recognize different dial-in users so itcan't offer dial-back.andP;  Access can be protected with a general password.andM;NetModem offers modem services to the network and can be used to link remotenetworks as well.andM;andgt;Timbuktu/Remote from Farallon offers a different sort of access.andP;  The $195program lets users access remote networks by remotely controlling the Mac itdials into.andP;  Although it is primarily designed for users who need to share ascreen, such as a manager who is troubleshooting problems, the program alsooffers file transfer.andM;Timbuktu/Remote can be password protected.andP;
