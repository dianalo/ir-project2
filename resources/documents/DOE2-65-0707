The rates of production of CO/sub 2/ and NO/sub x/ have beenmeasured over the first 4 ms. It proved possible to model the productionof CO/sub 2/ by considering the burning of volatiles from individualparticles. Also, the ratio of the concentrations of NO/sub x/ and CO/sub2/ was found to be independent of flame composition and temperature,as well as coal rank and size. In fact, around 43% of the nitrogen inthe volatiles always appears to end up as N/sub 2/ and the remaining57% as NO/sub x/.</TEXT></DOC>
