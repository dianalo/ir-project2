The Republican, Mr. Bush, had this to say: &quot;The American-Israeli strategic partnership is going to be even stronger tomorrow.&quot;    The Democrat, Mr. Dukakis, declared: &quot;I will strengthen our strategic partnership.&quot;    The words were so similar that the two presidential candidates could have been reading from the same text. And that's about how deep the campaign discussion of the Middle East's explosive problems has gotten. Beyond election-year bromides about loyalty to Israel-aimed more at Jewish voters in New York and California than at the complexities of the region -- the candidates have chosen to dodge most Middle East issues.    As a result, except for occasional arguments over the location of the U.S. Embassy in Israel and the chances for a Palestinian state, voters haven't heard the candidates discuss this vital region. &quot;We ought to get a little bit of a sense of how important they think regions like the Mideast are,&quot; says William Quandt, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. &quot;Will {they} rely primarily on diplomatic strategy? Are they inclined to cooperate with the Soviet Union? It would be nice to know these things. I don't expect to get those answers.&quot;    Though the campaign rhetoric doesn't show it, some vexing Middle East problems will face the next president as soon as he enters the Oval Office. Israel is holding its own Nov. 1 parliamentary election, which may well produce another paralyzing coalition between the left-wing Labor bloc and the right-wing Likud bloc. If that happens, the new U.S. president will inherit the task of convincing a divided Israel to agree on a path to Arab-Israeli peace.    Sporadic rioting persists among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Jordan's King Hussein, who recently upset American peace strategies by washing his hands of the problem of Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, will have to be coaxed back into the peace game.    If the king remains on the sideline, the new U.S. president will have to handle mounting pressure to deal instead with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Meanwhile, American hostages could well remain in captivity in Lebanon, so a new president may have to decide both how to get them out and how far to go to improve relations with Iran in the wake of its war with Iraq.    The candidates' reluctance to delve into such issues is understandable, for the Middle East is in even more political ferment than usual right now. &quot;There are just too many uncertainties there,&quot; says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the House Middle East subcommittee and an adviser to Gov. Dukakis.    Yet despite this high level of ferment, U.S. voters see no immediate prospect of war or threat of disrupted oil supplies, which have galvanized attention on the Middle East in past campaigns. So Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis aren't compelled to be more forthcoming.    Some analysts think the sparse debate actually might be a good thing, because the candidates aren't being prodded into taking positions that later would limit their diplomatic flexibility. &quot;The problems facing either candidate after the election are going to be so overwhelming that I wouldn't want to overload them with campaign promises,&quot; says Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council staff member now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.    In any case, it's impossible to discern big distinctions between the Bush and Dukakis approaches to the Middle East. &quot;Frankly, there's not a great deal of difference between them,&quot; says Mr. Quandt. &quot;There's a marginal difference at best.&quot;    Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis pledge to continue looking to Israel as a &quot;strategic&quot; partner, implying a continuation of the close military, as well as political, ties that grew during the Reagan administration. Both promise to pursue a peace process that is based on direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, while also saying that Palestinians must be included in the process.    Neither says what kind of Palestinian negotiating partners would be sought. But both endorse the conditions the U.S. has long demanded that the PLO meet before it can participate in talks: renunciation of terrorism, recognition of Israel's right to exist and acceptance of United Nations peace resolutions. And both candidates have added a new condition to the list: They insist that the PLO also explicitly renounce its 1964 charter calling for the destruction of Israel.    The two most significant differences that have cropped up involve Mr. Bush's flat opposition to a Palestinian state, and Mr. Dukakis's suggestions that he might move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.    Mr. Bush flatly declares his opposition to any Palestinian state, arguing that such a state would be dangerous to both Jordan and Israel. Mr. Dukakis says the question of Palestinian government is an issue to be decided in the course of negotiations among Israel, Arab states and Palestinians.    &quot;When one talks about a Palestinian state today, that's really a euphemism for a PLO-run state, and that would be dangerous to Israel and Jordan,&quot; maintains Dennis Ross, the Bush campaign's director of foreign-policy issues. But the Dukakis camp, while acknowledging that a Palestinian state isn't likely to emerge from peace negotiations, argues that flatly ruling out one now undermines America's chances of playing honest broker in negotiations. &quot;If you're serious about letting Israel make its own peace, then you don't dictate the contours of that peace,&quot; says James Steinberg, the Dukakis campaign's director of national-security issues.    Some Middle East analysts are more critical of Mr. Dukakis's statements about Jerusalem, asserting that they show insensitivity about the politics of the region. He has said the U.S. should recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and that the U.S. should move its embassy there if Israel asks. But the status of Jerusalem, which was divided between Israel and Jordan before the 1967 Mideast war, remains a hot international issue, and Republican and Democratic administrations alike have resisted pressure to move the embassy.    Beyond those disputes, Mr. Dukakis charges that the Reagan administration has been too willing to make arms sales to Arab states, declaring that he will &quot;say no to Arab shopping lists that endanger the security of Israel.&quot; Some analysts worry, though, that Mr. Dukakis is displaying too much disdain for arms sales to Arab states, which have been useful diplomatic tools for the U.S.    For his part, Mr. Bush argues that he would be better able to strengthen Israel because his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative will produce technologies that Israel can use to defend itself against ballistic missiles being acquired by Arab states. In fact, though, Mr. Dukakis supports the Arrow project, a joint U.S.-Israeli project to develop an anti-tactical ballistic missile.    In the end, campaign posturing over the Middle East is designed mostly to secure Jewish votes. The sensitivity of the Jewish vote is illustrated by the fact that the Bush campaign dissolved an early advisory group on the Middle East in part because it was seen as too pro-Arab. At the same time, James Zogby, executive director of the Arab American Institute, complains that Mr. Dukakis has declined to meet with Arab-American community leaders because such meetings would be too controversial with Jewish voters. (His campaign insists that Mr. Dukakis has met with groups that include Arab-Americans.)    The big issue among Jewish voters this year is &quot;each side's anti-Semites,&quot; says Steven Cohen, a professor of sociology at Queens College who studies Jewish political attitudes. Jewish voters are suspicious of the Dukakis campaign's ties to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the former Democratic presidential candidate who has been critical of Israel and accused of insensitivity to Jews. The Bush campaign, in turn, accepted the resignations of a handful of supporters from a campaign advisory committee on ethnic issues after they were accused of anti-Semitic activity.    Middle East issues probably will remain so sensitive, and campaign pressures so stifling, that a more-sophisticated discussion won't emerge. To illustrate the point, a prominent Middle East analyst in Washington recounts a call from one campaign asking for some guidance. The guidance couldn't be more than four sentences long, the campaign cautioned; the campaign staff wouldn't have time to read any more than that.    ---              Bush and Dukakis on the Middle East   Similarities . . .   Bush: &quot;Peace will be achieved through direct negotiations by the parties.&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;Peace must come through direct negotiations.&quot;   Bush: &quot;As for the PLO, I will insist that it accept U.N. Resolution 242, recognize Israel's existence, abandon terrorism, and change its covenant calling for Israel's destruction . . .&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;My friends, there can never be a role in negotiations for the PLO unless it renounces terrorism in word and deed, unless it accepts U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, and unless it clearly and explicitly renounces its own covenant . . .&quot;   Bush: &quot;I am proud that we are working with Israel today on . . . an anti-tactical ballistic missile. . .&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;We're going to do all we can to protect Israel from the growing threat of tactical ballistic missiles.&quot;   And Differences . . .   Bush: &quot;I have made very clear that I am opposed to an independent Palestinian state . . .&quot;   Dukakis: &quot;The Republican ticket doesn't acknowledge Israel's sovereignty over its capital -- an undivided Jerusalem. We do.&quot;   Source: Candidates' speeches to B'nai B'rith</TEXT></DOC>
