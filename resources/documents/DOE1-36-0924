The nature of these gaps will be covered briefly inthe body of this paper. The need to ensure that the benefits of biotechnologyproducts are safely realized and that their environmental applicationsdo not result in new sources of environmental degradation provides thefundamental rationale for systematic assessments of risk before fieldtesting or commercial use.</TEXT></DOC>
