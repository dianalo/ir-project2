This divergence is not an accident. With fiscal policy in most industrial countries moving in a restrictive direction and capital flows to developing countries having slowed to a trickle, rising financial-asset prices are one of the few mechanisms left to central bankers for transforming surplus liquidity and falling interest rates into potential economic growth.    The problem with this adjustment process is that the world financial system is not a &quot;level playing field.&quot; There is a tremendous asymmetry in the responsiveness of different national economies to falling interest rates.    The Anglo-Saxon nations, such as the U.S. and Britain, have highly competitive financial systems that expand credit rapidly when monetary policy is eased. The Japanese financial system, by contrast, is very regulated and does not easily recycle surplus liquidity from savers to spenders. As a result, the Japanese corporate sector is currently using its excess liquidity to engage in aggressive stock market speculation. This has pushed share-price multiples to such high levels that the recently privatized Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. now boasts a price-earnings ratio of 250 and a capitalization in excess of the entire West German stock market. In Germany, falling interest rates are a less potent stimulant to growth than in the past because the population is shrinking at the rate of 3,000 a week and there is an increasing stock of vacant housing.    In the 1970s, this asymmetry was less of a barrier to stimulating demand because expansionary monetary policy in the industrial countries helped boost exports, not just domestic consumption, by encouraging a large increase in bank lending to developing countries. This, in turn, generated powerful effects on global consumption of capital goods, which itself reinforced economic growth in developing nations by increasing demand in the industrial countries for raw materials to produce the goods. Since 1982, though, there has been a sharp decline in the world-wide level of interest rates without any major revival of capital flows to developing countries. Instead, they have exported nearly $90 billion to the industrial countries through interest payments on existing loans.    The inability of most developing countries to tap the surplus liquidity of the industrial countries poses a potential dilemma for central banks. It could require the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to tolerate further rapid growth in domestic borrowing and stock market speculation simply to sustain modest growth in the world economy. Under such circumstances, financial-asset inflation could become so excessive that the central banks might ultimately feel compelled to tighten again even if economic growth remains slow.    Ironically, the most effective way to reduce the danger of financial excesses occurring in New York and Tokyo would not be to raise interest rates and depress equity markets. Rather, it would be to correct the uneven distribution of liquidity in the world financial system by expanding the capitalization of stock markets in developing countries in order to help them become capital importers again.    Bond and stock markets have not been important conduits for international capital transfers in recent decades, but during the half century before 1914 they were the primary mechanism for recycling excess savings from the industrial countries to newly developing regions. During this period, Britain and France embarked upon a global securitized lending and equity investment boom so large that by 1913 both countries' external assets were equal to between 150% and 200% of their gross national product. (This compares with a peak of only 8% for the U.S. five years ago and less than 15% for Japan today.)    British investors turned to foreign securities during the late 19th century because of the low yield then available on domestic debt. The large decline in interest rates in industrialized countries since 1984, coupled with today's excess capacity in global investment banking, suggests that now could be an opportune time to revive the role of stock markets as intermediaries for recycling more of the world's surplus savings to the developing countries.    During the past 12 months, Wall Street has successfully launched several new mutual funds targeted on Australian bonds as well as the equity markets of Taiwan, South Korea, India and other developing countries. These funds have raised only a few hundred million dollars compared with the $25 billion to $35 billion banks lent annually to the Third World during the late 1970s, but the premiums being paid by investors for them in the secondary market suggest that demand for developing-country equity products today exceeds supply.    Governments in developing countries must now pursue policies to accelerate the growth of foreign investment in their equity markets by (a) encouraging more private companies to go public through improved tax treatment of dividends and capital gains; (b) privatizing nationalized industries; (c) creating effective stock market regulatory agencies as well as more reliable public accounting standards; and (d) relaxing restrictions on foreign investment in domestic companies.    At present, the 15 largest stock markets in the developing countries have an aggregate capitalization of just under $145 billion, which is equal to about 14% of their GNP. If they could expand this percentage to 25% over the next six years against a background of only 6% growth in their nominal dollar GNP, the total value of their market capitalizations would exceed $400 billion by 1993.    If this sounds ambitious, consider that the stock market capitalization of the world's 14 largest industrial countries has grown from $2.2 trillion in 1980 to almost $6 trillion today. Since developing countries have higher potential growth rates than mature industrial economies, the value of their stock market capitalizations should increase even more rapidly if they pursue policies designed to encourage equity ownership.    Although the development of equity markets is a theoretically attractive way to increase capital flows, some developing countries resist using them as vehicles for attracting foreign savings. Nationalized industries are often a source of patronage and hence political power. Also, many governments associate foreign ownership with loss of control over the economy.    Although fear of foreign control is a natural legacy of the colonial era, governments could liberalize investment guidelines without losing control of their economies. Instead of permitting completely open access to their stock markets, developing countries could permit gradual liberalization through the creation of mutual funds specially targeted at foreign investors while introducing official ceilings on foreign ownership of strategic industries. Japan permitted the creation of such mutual funds in the 1960s before opening its market to direct foreign purchases of local shares. A similar process is under way in Korea and Taiwan. Singapore, meanwhile, permits foreign investors to purchase any of its equities, but has a 20% foreign ownership ceiling on several important companies.    If we apply an across-the-board 20% ownership restriction on the $400 billion of equity capitalization that could be available in the early 1990s under policies designed to achieve a 25% stock market/GNP ratio, the equity markets of developing countries would be able to absorb up to $80 billion of foreign investment without jeopardizing official ceilings.    In addition to the creation of more mutual funds, there would probably also be a good market for hybrid instruments, such as convertible debt or bonds with equity warrants. Because of restrictions on foreign purchases of Korean stock, there has been strong demand for Korean Eurobonds, which can be converted into equity later. Other obvious candidates for such hybrid instruments would include countries sensitive to the question of foreign ownership, such as Brazil, India and Mexico. Developing-country mutual funds also could tap into the growing secondary market for Third World bank loans in order to obtain foreign exchange at a discount, as is now happening with multinational companies operating in Mexico, Chile and the Philippines.    It is possible that investors diversifying into developing-country financial markets will repeat the mistakes of U.S. bankers in the 1970s. During America's emergence as a major capital exporter in the 1920s, U.S. investors bought more than $6 billion in bonds from issuers in Latin America and Central Europe; almost 40% were defaulted on in the Depression. In fact, the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted partly because of public outrage at First National City Co. of New York for securitizing its bad Peruvian loans and selling them to unsophisticated retail investors.    But except for the 1920s, history suggests that bond and stock investors have done a better of job of screening risks than commercial banks. In the early 1970s, the Philippines had one of the largest stock markets in Asia, but it shrank steadily during the final years of the Marcos regime because of economic mismanagement and theft of company assets by Marcos cronies. If bankers had monitored the Manila stock market more carefully, they might have made fewer bad loans to the Philippines.    Last year, a slump in foreign demand for Australian bonds forced the Hawke government to introduce policies more favorable for attracting investment and reducing the country's external deficit. Had commercial banks been financing the country's payments imbalance, it might have remained on a policy course akin to Latin America's in the late 1970s.    The next time the Brazilian finance minister, Dilson Funaro, travels north in search of financial assistance, he should not bother to stop in Washington. Instead, Mr. Funaro should fly directly to Tokyo and unveil the prospectus for a new trillion yen Nippon-Brazil Fund. Not only would such a fund give a boost to his country's beleaguered capital account, it also would provide an alternative outlet for Japan's excess savings and help to prevent Tokyo's liquidity-crazed stockbrokers from pushing the price-earnings multiple of NTandamp;T to such lofty levels that the company's capitalization would exceed all of Latin America's $350 billion of foreign debt.    ---   Mr. Hale is chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.    ---                 Equity Markets 1986                       Market Size                      (In billions        As Percent                  of U.S. dollars)            Of GDP U.S.              $2.2 (trillion)            52.3% Asia South Korea             14.0                 16.5 Taiwan                  13.2                 22.3 Philippines              2.0                  6.2 Thailand                 2.9                  7.5 Malaysia and Singapore           32.6                 68.6 Indonesia                0.5                  0.6 India                   20.0                 12.2 Latin America Brazil                  44.0                 21.5 Mexico                   6.0                  3.9 Argentina                1.6                  2.4 Chile                    2.7                 13.5 Africa and Midest Nigeria                  2.5                  3.0 Zimbabwe                 0.4                  7.4 Jordan                   2.6                 57.8</TEXT></DOC>
