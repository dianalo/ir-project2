Fuels futures escaped the late sell-off, with heating oilfor December delivery rising one cent a gallon on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   Both heating oil and gas oil, its European counterpart,drew support from the cold wave that swept much of the U.S.,pushing temperatures down to record lows for the fall in manyareas. In the heavy trading that resulted on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, December heating oil settled at 71.68cents a gallon after reaching an intraday high of 72.05cents.   January heating oil settled 0.76 cent a gallon higher at71.94 cents. On London's International Petroleum Exchange,gas oil futures closed as much as $4.75 a metric ton higheron the day.   John Hill, a vice president of the Merrill Lynch energytrading desk in New York, said the extraordinary cold was achief reason for the run-up of heating oil, or No. 2 fuel asit is known in the industry. He also cited technical factorsand a problem at a Mobil Corp. refinery in Texas, where aweekend fire resulted in the closing of a 100,000barrels-a-day crude-processing unit.   &quot;I think at some point we will see 75 cents a gallon onNo. 2 oil, but the bottom line is what the weather does,&quot;said Mr. Hill.   Futures prices of crude oil for December deliveryinitially rose in both New York and London on the reports ofnew supply hitches, some of them due to the weather.According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, stormyweather halted loading of oil tankers at the U.K.'s mainterminal at Sullom Voe in the North Sea. In Nigeria,meanwhile, the Forcados oil terminal off the Niger Riverdelta continued to operate at reduced levels yesterdaybecause of civil unrest that closed some onshore oil fields.   In U.S. futures trading, the December crude contract brokethrough the important level of $24 a barrel before fallingback. It settled at $23.80, down two cents a barrel for theday.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK andamp; MEAT: Prices of cattle futures contracts sanksharply amid continuing concern about the rising supply ofbeef, pork and poultry that American farmers are expected toproduce next year. Traders are worried that beef prices willfall because it is the highest-priced meat and is vulnerableto consumer concerns about fat. In trading at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange yesterday, the cattle contract forDecember delivery dropped 1.25 cents a pound to settle at72.32 cents a pound. Despite the weak economy, some livestockanalysts are predicting that the hog slaughter will increaseby roughly 7% next year while poultry production increasesabout 4%. U.S. beef production might climb about 2% nextyear. &quot;Some meat has got to sell at a lower price,&quot; said JohnNalivka, executive vice president of Sterling Marketing Inc.of Lenexa, Kan. Prices of some hog futures contracts dropped.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Rumors of a Brazilian price rise and worriesabout cold weather reaching Florida orange crops pushedprices higher. After trading as high as $1.715 a pound, juicefor November delivery retreated on profit-taking to end at$1.6825, up 1.25 cents. The actively traded January contractgained 1.85 cents to finish at $1.7305. Talk circulated thatBrazil had raised its prices to between $1.70 and $1.75 apound from $1.55, analysts said. Although the rumor wasunconfirmed, it triggered a flurry of buying, which in turnsparked additional buying based on technical factors to pushprices to life-of-contract highs. Stephen Platt, vicepresident at Dean Witter in Chicago, said both Brazil andFlorida are thought to have been slow to raise cash pricesfor fear of reducing demand. Also affecting prices wereconcerns that below-freezing temperatures in northern Floridawould reach the orange crop farther south. But Peter Leavitt,executive vice president of Weather Services Corp. inBedford, Mass., said that while it might have remindedtraders about the approaching winter, this particular coldspell won't affect Florida's oranges.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices continued to fall. December coffeelost 0.25 cent a pound to end at 78.55 cents. More rain thanexpected fell in coffee-growing areas of Brazil over theweekend, said Mike Palmerino, senior meteorologist at WeatherServices Corp. The precipitation should have been verybeneficial to the flowering coffee trees, he said, but addedthere doesn't appear to be any additional rains coming thisweek. Mike Crawford, a broker with J.C. Bradford andamp; Co. inNashville, Tenn., added that prices have tended to declinebefore the last four or five contract expirations. Traderswho had bet the price would rise but don't want to meet theobligation to accept coffee deliveries close out theirpositions by selling offsetting contracts before first noticeday, when contract holders begin to make their deliveryintentions known. Prices tend to rise after first notice dayas traders who had bet prices would fall cover theirpositions by buying offsetting contracts to avoid having todeliver coffee. Mr. Crawford predicted prices would fall to76 cents by first notice day for the December contract in twoweeks. He added that anticipated problems with the Braziliancrop are apparently prompting merchants to ship Ivory Coastcoffee from Europe to the U.S. Although the Ivory Coastcoffee isn't deliverable against the futures contracts, itdoes add to supplies, he noted.</TEXT></DOC>
