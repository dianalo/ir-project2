A lawsuit filed by five residents as a class action had sought$300 million.   The settlement underscores the government's intensified effort toregain public confidence in its nuclear weapons program, which isrun from 17 major plants in 12 states. Many of the sites are badlypolluted from four decades of bomb making.   The government has acknowledged that at least 383,000 pounds ofradioactive uranium oxide dust had been released through faultyfilters at the Fernald facility since the plant opened in 1951. Thefull extent of environmental damage has not been determined.   Louise Roselle, one of the attorneys for the 14,000 people livingwithin five miles of the plant who are represented in the classaction, said the settlement allows for an additional $5 millionpayment to nearby businesses if they can show lost property value.   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said the terms wereapproved by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins late Friday and wouldbe presented to U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnatinext week.   Watkins has said he would step up department efforts to resolvepast environmental damage from nuclear weapons plants and limitfuture harm.   ``It's a major concern to us,' said Moore. ``This whole idea ofthis lawsuit, with people being upset, diminution of property values_ all these kinds of things would not have occurred if we had doneit right in the past.''   Watkins earlier this week blamed his own department for disarrayin the weapons program, saying key managers and supervisors lackedtechnical skills and some lacked the necessary discipline for safeoperation of nuclear reactors.   The congressman whose district includes the plant predicted morelawsuits by people who live near contaminated bomb factories. ``It'sa tragedy that the taxpayers are bearing the brunt of 35 years ofcontamination and concealment,'' said Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio.   In the Ohio lawsuit, residents near the Feed Materials ProductionCenter at Fernald, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, saidradioactive contamination from the uranium plant polluted soil, airand water in their area. They claimed this caused them mental stressand reduced the value of their property.   Moore said he sympathized with the public's concerns aboutpossible illegal pollution from nuclear weapons plants, but heexpressed doubt about the Fernald claims.   ``A lot of that is hysteria,'' he said. ``There really wasn't,judging by what I heard ... a lot of hard evidence of anybody losinganything _ as a matter of fact, almost none.''   He said he believed the settlement, if made final, would be thefirst of its kind.   Judge Spiegel scheduled an Aug. 23 hearing on the agreement. Ifthe judge approves the settlement, the government must deposit themoney into four Cincinnati banks no later than Oct. 15, said Roselle.   A U.S. District Court jury in Cincinnati earlier this monthrecommended in a mock trial that the Fernald residents be awarded$136 million. The recommendation was issued as a non-bindingverdict, a procedure used in Ohio to encourage settlement of alawsuit before it goes to trial.   The plant was run for the Energy Department by National Lead ofOhio Inc., until 1986.   The residents' group filed suit against National Lead and itsparent company, but the Department of Energy has acceptedresponsibility for its contractor because of an indemnificationclause in its contract, and the government has provided defensecounsel to its contractor.</TEXT></DOC>
