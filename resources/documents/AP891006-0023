On a 333-91 vote, the House approved the legislation Thursdayafter nearly two weeks of clamorous debate that saw the leaders ofthe majority Democrats take a series of embarrassing tumbles.   Chief among them was the adoption of a capital gains reductioncoveted by President Bush, and rejection of a Democratic plan toraise taxes on the wealthy while restoring some IndividualRetirement Account benefits.   ``My gosh, how many more wins can we have in a one-week ortwo-week period of time?'' House Republican Leader Robert Michel ofIllinois asked reporters.   On final passage, 187 Democrats and 146 Republicans voted forapproval while 63 Democrats and 28 Republicans were opposed.   Senate leaders hoped to finish their own version of the bill bySunday night.   The measure is the keystone of congressional efforts to reducethe projected deficit for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday, to nomore than $110 billion. Current projections for this year'sshortfall are about $116 billion, not counting thedeficit-reduction bill.   The measure has been criticized for containing phony savings,such as not counting next year's anticipated Postal Service lossesof nearly $2 billion for budget purposes.   If the legislation isn't enacted by Oct. 16, the Gramm-Rudmanbalanced budget law will trigger automatic spending cuts on defenseand many domestic programs, averaging about 5 percent of theirbudgets.</TEXT><BYLINE>CAPITAL GAINS</BYLINE><TEXT>   The bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits fromselling capital assets such as real estate and stocks.

The change is expected to bring the Treasury $2.9 billion infiscal 1990, $3.8 billion in fiscal 1991 and $2.7 billion in fiscal1992 as people take advantage of the lower rate and increase theircapital activity.

The bill would require companies to move quickly to give thegovernment the payroll taxes they withhold from employees, andrepeal a 1986 tax law provision, known as Section 89, aimed atensuring that employer-financed health plans don't discriminate infavor of higher-paid employees.
