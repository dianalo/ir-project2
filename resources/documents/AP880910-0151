Ms. Chinn was appointed last month by Mayor W. Wilson Goode tohis new Leadership Anti-Drug Council. Goode ordered a fullinvestigation of Friday's fire that heavily damaged Ms. Chinn'shome.   Ms. Chinn, 47, organized and led three anti-drug marches in herneighborhood in June. She has stood with neighbors in front of drughouses and demanded that the dealers leave.   If the arson was in retaliation for her anti-drug work, Goodesaid, then ``it is one more tragic example of the recklessness ofdrug dealers in the city, and reaffirms the resolve of thisadministration to push even harder to drive the pushers out of thecity.''   Arsonists used a five-gallon plastic container to carryflammable liquid to the second floor of Ms. Chinn's home,investigators said. The fluid was poured in a rear bedroom and downa back staircase.   Earlier in the week, District Attorney Ronald Castille and twocity council members rallied with tenants of a public housingcomplex, Abbottsford Homes, where some tenants reported threats.   Dorothy and Betty, who spoke on condition their last names notbe used, said they received death threats after five people werearrested on drug charges last month in the complex. In June, thetwo had helped lead tenants through the complex, chanting sloganssuch as ``Drug dealers got to go.''   That slogan was mimicked by the death threat displayed by Betty:``Newsy neighbors got to go before you land on death row!!'' Themessage was accompanied by a stick figure drawing of a person witha noose around the neck, and beside it the words ``This is you.''   Gregory Kern, executive director of the Philadelphia HousingAuthority, said he was negotiating with police to open amini-police station at Abbottsford.   Castille said he and Kern would try to enforce new federallegislation that enables district attorneys to facilitate theeviction of alleged drug-dealing tenants from public housing units.While the housing authority already has the power to evict thosewho sell drugs from their apartments, those evictions come slowly.</TEXT></DOC>
