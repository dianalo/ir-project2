The bid substantially exceeds the most recent proposal of $50 a share, or $220 million, from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., an Orlando, Fla.-based publisher. Analysts had predicted that other bidders might emerge because Harper andamp; Row is one of the few publicly held publishers remaining after a spate of mergers in the industry last year.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Harper andamp; Row jumped $8.375 to close at $64.125, as 244,900 shares changed hands.    The interest in Harper andamp; Row, a 170-year-old publisher of educational, medical and professional books, began earlier this month when Princeton, N.J., publisher Theodore Cross bid $34 a share, or about $141 million, for the company. A few days later, Harcourt Brace made its bid.    &quot;In view of Mr. Murdoch's offer, we don't have anything to say, except we're no longer involved,&quot; a spokesman for Harcourt Brace said yesterday.    Mr. Murdoch and Winthrop Knowlton, chairman of a special committee of Harper andamp; Row directors, said the two companies agreed to merge Harper andamp; Row with Harper Acquisition Inc., a subsidiary of News America Holdings Inc. News America is the principle U.S. subsidiary of News Corp., Mr. Murdoch's Australian-based publishing empire.    The bid will be financed with cash and existing lines of credit, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch said.    Mr. Murdoch's empire extends around the world and includes interests in newspapers, magazines, television stations and a major motion picture studio in the U.S. But until now, he hasn't been a major player in the book publishing industry. His only holding has been 41.7% of the voting stock in William Collins PLC, a book publishing company based in the United Kingdom. He bought that stake in 1981, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch said.    News Corp. said discussions have begun on the possibility of Collins acquiring an equity interest in Harper andamp; Row. News Corp. also said it is discussing with Collins the possibility of that company participating substantially in the management of Harper andamp; Row. If an agreement is reached, News Corp. said, Collins's senior executives, including Ian Chapman, its chairman and chief executive officer, would &quot;become directly involved in the management and strategic direction of Harper andamp; Row.&quot;    The Murdoch bid took many Wall Street analysts by surprise. After Harcourt's bid, Harper andamp; Row said its board named a committee of outside directors to consider the company's alternatives, and hired Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. as its financial adviser. Last week Harper andamp; Row said it was holding &quot;active discussions&quot; with &quot;a considerable number of domestic and foreign firms,&quot; but it declined to identify any of them. Industry sources named several companies as possible acquirers, but News Corp. wasn't among them.    J. Kendrick Noble, a publishing analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc., said the News Corp. bid seemed &quot;pre-emptive,&quot; adding that he doubted it would be topped by another bidder.    In its year ended April 30, Harper andamp; Row earned $7.6 million, or $1.76 a share, including earnings from continuing operations of $5.9 million, or $1.35 a share. Revenue totaled $201.4 million.    Under the agreement between Mr. Murdoch and Harper andamp; Row, Harper Acquisition will begin a tender offer for all Harper andamp; Row shares outstanding Friday or earlier. Harper andamp; Row's directors have unanimously recommended that stockholders accept the offer and approve the agreement. Harper employees control about 29% of the company's about 4.4 million common shares outstanding; directors and managers own an additional 17% and Mr. Cross controls close to 6%.    Mr. Cross couldn't be reached for comment.    News America also has been issued an option, exercisable under certain circumstances, to buy as much as 800,000 Harper andamp; Row shares at $65 each; such steps are taken to discourage other bidders. If the transaction isn't completed, Harper andamp; Row will pay $16 million to News America.    Brooks Thomas, Harper andamp; Row's chairman and chief executive officer, called the transaction &quot;in the best interests of not only the shareholders but also the employees, authors and other Harper andamp; Row constituencies.&quot;    The spokesman for News Corp. said he couldn't &quot;say anything definitive&quot; about whether the company is planning to restructure Harper andamp; Row. &quot;They're just beginning to review the options,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
