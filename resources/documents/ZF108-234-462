(standards for transmitting large rasterimages) (technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Shepherd, Barry J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>An addendum to part 7 of ISO 8613 is intended to provide astandard for transmitting large raster images, such as mechanicaldrawings, over communications lines via provision of tilingfunctions.andP;  Tiling is the partitioning of a large raster imageinto a set of smaller images, or tiles, to improve communicationsperformance and to assist 'windowed' viewing of large drawings.andO;ISO 8613 is intended to allow the description of a document withtext, images and/or vector graphic pictures for transmissionbetween computer systems.andP;  Part 7 describes raster graphic contentarchitecture, and part 8 describes geometric graphics contentarchitecture based on the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)standard.andP;  Several terms are defined to allow description of theraster graphics architecture: pel path, line progression, pelspacing and line spacing.andP;  Development of the standard isdescribed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer GraphicsStandardsData CommunicationsImage ProcessingStandardizationNew TechniqueRaster ScanCommunications TechnologyInternational Organization for Standardization.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
