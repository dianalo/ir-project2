<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0465 </DOCNO><TEXT>Comparisons have been made between data obtained from dynamometer testsof various electric vehicles and computer simulations of the same vehicle-batterycombinations for several driving cycles. The vehicles included in thestudy were the ETV-1, Bedford Van, Unique Mobility, ETX-1 and DSEP(TB-1).The batteries studied were the ALCO 2200, Gel/cel 3, EV5T, ETX-100(CHL12),and the NIF-170. The comparisons indicated that the energy consumptionvalues obtained using ELVEC agree within 10% with test data for bothconstant speed and variable power driving schedules. The range comparisonswere less consistent, but the predictions agreed with the data to within10% if the vehicle battery was in good condition and the controller didnot limit battery power at low states-of-charge. Second-by-second comparisonsof measured and calculated values of battery power and current duringtransient vehicle operation showed the agreement worse than would havebeen expected based on the good agreement found for cycle energy consumption.Further development of ELVEC is needed to complete its validation asan electric vehicle simulation code. 12 refs., 6 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
