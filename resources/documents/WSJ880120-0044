Manville, a building and forest-products concern, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in August 1982, when it was faced with a flood of asbestos-related lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from exposure to Manville products containing asbestos, a mineral that was once widely used in piping and insulation.    The court's rejection of the appeal moves Manville a step closer to emerging from bankrupty-law protection. Its reorganization plan was approved last December by most classes of its creditors and a U.S. bankruptcy judge, but the plan hasn't been implemented pending appeals by the building-materials distributor and a group of asbestos health claimants.    Manville said the appeal filed by a group of 400 asbestos claimants in the New York federal appeals court is still pending, and it doesn't know when the court will issue a ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
