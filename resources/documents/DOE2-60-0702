The Tenzan power station usesa high head machine having dynamic head of exceeding 600 m. The equipmenthas a very high reliability. Outline of the power stations, performanceof the pump turbines, model tests, features in structure and strength,and the results of field tests are reported. At the Tenzan power station,many items were studied and tested, for the sake of improved overalleconomy and performance, such as optimum speed, performance, mechanicalstrength and structural features. Major items examined for the Matanogawapower station were the water channel system, performance check, strengthand structural features, etc. (10 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
