Security forces raided at least seven churches or church schoolsSunday and Monday in a backlash to the offensive that paralyzed thecapital for a week.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker blamed the raids on ``overlyaggressive security forces'' and suggested President AlfredoCristiani was having ``management control problems'' with extremistelements of his government.   ``I really think President Cristiani is under a barrage from allsides. I think some things are happening that he would prefer notto happen,'' said Walker.   Church workers and war refugees they sheltered were questionedand the buildings were searched for arms, ammunition and medicine,said church officials, workers and witnesses.   Salvadoran churches, especially those that work with the poor,are considered hotbeds of leftist subversion by the right andauthorities suspect them of aiding or harboring guerrillas.   In Washington, President Bush said he opposed cutting off aid inresponse to the slayings Thursday of six Jesuit priests, whichArchbishop Arturo Rivera Damas of San Salvador said appeared to bethe work of the military.   The House of Representatives rejected an attempt to restrict theaid, voting 215-194 to keep the restriction from being added to aforeign aid bill.   Combat between guerrillas and the army was largely confined tothe working class neighborhood of Soyapango. There was heavyfighting in Apopa, a town 12 miles to the north and about halfwayalong the retreat route for rebels returning to their strongholdson Guazapa mountain.   Although thousands were homeless, the capital appeared to bereturning to normal. Stores, shops and other businesses were openand service stations were selling gasoline for the first time sincelast week.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front high command saidMonday the offensive had dealt the government serious blows.   ``The fascist beast is defeated politically and militarily, itis mortally wounded,'' the guerrillas said on their clandestineradio, Venceremos.   National Guard troops raided the Episcopal church just after thedusk-to-dawn curfew ended, a guard officer said privately.   The church, in one of San Salvador's most affluentneighborhoods, has sheltered about 200 refugees.   Nine Salvadorans and seven foreigners were arrested and taken toTreasury Police headquarters, said a church worker who would notlet his name be used.   The Treasury Police refused to confirm they had anyone from thechurch in custody. Treasury Police used to investigate fiscalcrimes, but since the civil war began they have been in charge ofpolitical cases.   All those detained worked in the church's social servicesprogram, the church worker said.   He said the director of the program, his wife and a lay workerwere arrested Sunday in their homes.   The foreigners included Josephine Beecher of Lopez Island,Wash., a Canadian woman, a Colombian, a Guatemalan and three peoplefrom Spain. The Canadian, Karen Ridd, 28, of Winnipeg, was releasedlate Monday with a Colombian collegue, a Canadian Embassy officialin Costa Rica said.   The church worker said they probably would be deported. Otherforeign workers, including a dozen Lutheran missionaries, have beenarrested and expelled from the country in recent days.   The Rev. Luis Serrano, the Episcopal pastor, went into hiding,the church worker said.   The office of the archbishop of San Salvador said there alsowere raids on the Emmanuel Baptist Church and five Roman Catholicchurches or schools.   The Lutheran Church was shuttered. Its bishop, Medardo Gomez, isan outspoken member of the national coalition seeking peace talksbetween the U.S.-backed government and the rebels.   Like many clerics, including Rivera Damas and the slain Jesuits,Gomez says nothing has been done to address the poverty, ignoranceand misery that led to the decade-old conflict in thisMassachusetts-sized nation of 5.2 million.   Such opinions are deemed subversive by some on the right.   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado blamed Rivera Damas and theauxiliary bishop for fomenting leftist violence through their``questionable ideology.''   When asked if the raids, Colorado's statements and otherincidents indicated that Cristiani was having trouble maintainingcontrol over the more extreme elements of his government,Ambassador Walker said:   ``Management control problems exist in situations like this, andit's not a management control problem that would lnd itself to aHarvard Business school analysis. I mean, this is war. It'sfighting, it's death, it's events such as the killings of theJesuits that explode upon a president, and he's got to payattention.''   Cristiani campaigned as the representative of a new, moderatewing in a party long linked to El Salvador's infamous death squads.   Rivera Damas' office said security forces had raided three otherRoman Catholic churches and two schools on Sunday. War refuees werebeing sheltered at each of the sites.   At San Franciso Church, five Salvadoran lay workers were takenaway by soldiers, the parish priest said, refusing to give his name.   He said the soldiers accused the church of running a clandestineclinic for wounded guerrillas. The clinic is in an area held by therebels.   ``We don't make distinctions,'' he said. ``We were taking careof everyone. Our work is humanitarian, Christian. We didn't ask whopeople were. But none of them had weapons.''   Monday evening, the National Police searched the hotel room ofJoseph Gannon, an American reporter who works for Canada's MacLeanmagazine. Police left Gannon's room after 20 minutes, saying theyfound nothing incriminating.   Gannon was picked up Sunday in Soyapango and spent the day underarrest. He was released on orders of Col. Heriberto Hernandez,commander of the Treasury Police.   El Salvador has been under a state-of-emergency since theguerrillas launched an all-out attack Nov. 11. The emergencysuspends individual guarantees and allows police forces to searchpremises without a warrant.</TEXT></DOC>
