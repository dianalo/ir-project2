But analysts are skeptical of major goals, saying theBells have good technology for that business but don't yetknow how they will market such services.</LP><TEXT>   In an address to analysts here, Raymond W. Smith, BellAtlantic's chairman and chief executive officer, said therecent federal appeals court lifting of the ban oninformation businesses will result in $200 million to $300million in additional annual revenue within four to fiveyears. &quot;We have only begun to scratch the surface of whatwill be a major source of growth for us in the future,&quot; hesaid.   One of the ways the Philadelphia-based telecommunicationsconcern expects to achieve that growth is through strategicpartnerships with information services concerns, Mr. Smithsaid.   Ever since the regional Bell telephone companies won theruling allowing them to enter the lucrative business, therehas been growing speculation that they will seek to formalliances with information providers such as newspaperpublishers, who have been fighting to block the Bells' entry.   This week, Southwestern Bell Corp. said it is in talkswith several major publishers, including Pulitzer PublishingCo., about joint ventures to transmit informationelectronically.   But Joel Gross, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp., said he is skeptical that the phonecompanies will find it easy to succeed in this area. He saidmany regional Bells are looking at information services withan unrealistic &quot;field of dreams&quot; type of approach. The Bellsare &quot;engineering-driven,&quot; he said, and don't have themarketing systems in place to effectively compete ininformation services.</TEXT></DOC>
