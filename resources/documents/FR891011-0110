This order approves the proposalon a temporary basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27199 (August 30, 1989),54 FR 37395.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>The rule change would amend NSCC's Rule 52, section 17 (captioned ``Networking'').\3\<NOTE/> Rule 17 currently authroizes NSCC's broker-dealer and Fundmembers to use Networking for the transmission between themselves of mutualfund customer account data. NSCC notes that Networking's initial phasehas provided NSCC members with a centralized data communications systemfor the exchange of customer information and securities positions.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ``Networking'' is an NSCC service, provided on a subscriptionbasis, that permits automated transmission of mutual fund data betweenNSCC members and Fund/Serv. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26376 (December 20, 1988),53 FR 52544 [File No. SR-NSCC-88-08].<ITAG tagnum="28">``Fund/Serv''is a more basic NSCC mutual fund service. Participatingmutual funds are known as ``Fund members.'' The service is available toall NSCC broker-dealer members for subscription and service fees. The acronym``Serv'' of Fund/Serv refers to the services of mutual fund ``settlement,entry, and registration verification,'' services which, among others, areprovided by NSCC to the Subscribing members. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26377 (December20, 1988, 53 FR 52546; 24088 (December 20, 1988, 53 FR 52546; 24088 (February10, 1988), 52 FR 5228 [File Nos. SR-NSCC-87-12, SR-NSCC-86-05]<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>NSCC Important Notice No. A3232, dated August 15, 1989.The proposed amendments to Rule 17 (which NSCC terms Networking's ``secondphase'') will provide for the automated settlement of cash dividends paidby mutual funds for share positions maintained in Networking accounts.While dividend information on mutual funds currently is passed throughNetworking, the actual payment of the mutual fund distributions still occursdirectly between the Fund member and each broker that holds units of themutual fund. The proposed rule change will enable a Fund member to makeonly one distribution payment to NSCC, which then will be distributed viaNetworking to the brokers.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ NSCC states in its filing that a valid payable date forthis purpose will be defined as a date on which New York banks are openfor business.Under the proposal, NSCC will provide broker-dealer and Fund members usingNetworking a new file termed the Networking Settlement Summary File (``SummaryFile''). The Summary File will consist of two sub-files: (1) The NetworkingSettlement Summary Detail Output Record (``Output Record''), and (2) theNetworking Settlement Summary Trailer Record (``Trailer Record'').The Output Record will detail on a daily basis for each Fund member andeach broker as of the day before a distribution's payable date (``Payable-1''):(1) The payable and settlement dates,\6\<NOTE/> (2) the settlement amounts, and (3) all dividend updates(<T3>i.e.</T3>, additions and corrections) up to and including Payable-1.The Trailer Record will detail the identical information on a daily basisas of settlement date. NSCC will make the Summary File available at approxiamtely11:00 a.m. (EST) daily.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Under the proposal, payable dates and settlement datesordinarily will be the same. But a Fund member could report its dividendpayable information after the payable date. In that case, the settlementdate would be the date on which the information was reported. <T3>See </T3>NSCC's Important Notice No. A3232, dated August 10, 1989.Fund members must pay their cash dividend settlement figures in same-dayfunds, via Fedwire,\7\<NOTE/> no later that 1:00 p.m. (EST) on the payable date. NSCC willpay its broker members in next-day funds at approximately 3:00 p.m. Inasmuchas NSCC will be paid in same-day funds but will pay its members in next-dayfunds, it will credit its broker members with interest earned on thosefunds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ ``Fedwire'' is an acronym for the Federal Reserve Systemwire facility which provides a system for transferring funds among all12 Federal Reserve Banks, their 24 branches, the Federal Reserve officesin Washington, D.C. and Chicago, and the Commercial Credit Corporation.<T3>See </T3>Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,<T3>The October 1987 Market Break,</T3> at 1-12 (1988).The Fund members' dividend payments will constitute independent obligations.Accordingly, they ordinarily will not be netted with the Fund members'other settlement balances. If, however, as a result of Networking dividendcorrections and reversals, a Fund member's settlement figure results ina credit balance, NSCC will repay the balance in next-day funds.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ NSCC notes in its filing that the dividend payments willnot be a guaranteed service. If NSCC were to credit a broker with a dividendand not receive the corresponding debit from the Fund member, the creditwould be subject to reversal.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. NSCC's Rationale for the Proposal</ITAG>NSCC states that the proposed rule change would be consistent with section17A of the Act inasmuch as automating the settlement of mutual fund dividendswould promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act. TheCommission notes, moreover, that section 17A(a)(1) of the Act expresslyencourages the use of automated systems to make the processing of securitiestransactions more prompt and more efficient.The Commission understands that the implementation of this proposal willpermit the automated settlement of mutual fund distributions. That is,for a mutual fund participating in NSCC's Fund/Serv, dividend paymentsto many broker-dealers can be reduced to only one dividend payment to aclearing agency, NSCC, and NSCC would then distribute the dividends tothe brokers via its Networking system in next-day funds.In order to assess the benefits, costs and risks associated with this service,the Commission is approving the proposal on a temporary basis for threemonths. Within 60 days from the date of this order, NSCC has representedthat it will provide a report setting forth: (1) The number of dividendspaid through the service, (2) the dollar amounts paid, (3) the number andvalue of payments that are not received by 1:00 p.m.; and (4) the timeand date when such payments are received.The Commission finds good cause under section 19(b)(2) of the Act for approvingthis proposal on a temporary accelerated basis prior to the statutory thirtiethday after the notice of the filing in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This is because NSCC has represented to theCommission that its Fund members have equipment in place, have administeredtraining, and are scheduled to commence operations with the new systemon Friday, September 29, 1989, and that, accordingly, it would be burdensometo require them to stand down and renew their phase-in operations at alater time.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (SR-NSCC-89-13) be, and herebyis, approved on a temporary basis through December 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
