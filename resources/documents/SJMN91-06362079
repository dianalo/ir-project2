Yes, it's the Gangster Thing. And if you're sick of all those phonyItalian accents and gripes about how this or that town doesn't do justice topasta primavera, you'll love the enjoyable &quot;Bugsy&quot; -- with any luck the lastsign of Hollywood's quickly aging gangster fascination.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BREAKING UP THAT OLD GANG OF HIS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  MOVIES; Julie Maxson, 17, of Los Gatos, is a freshman at UC Berkeley.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In &quot;Bugsy,&quot; Warren Beatty goes from playing good guy Dick Tracy to playingreal guy hit-man Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel. The movie centers around two of thehighlights of Bugsy's life -- his intense love affair with Virginia Hill(Annette Bening) and his equally intense vision of building a gambling empirein then-virgin Nevada.;   Bugsy's passion for Hill is risky; not only doesBugsy have a wife and children, but also the relationship puts him at oddswith other members of the gang. Besides stealing Hill from someone else in thegang, his fixation on her makes the rest of the gang wonder how much he'sconcentrating on business.;   But the gang backs him nonetheless. When theimpulsive Hill insists that Bugsy close an eyesore gambling hall in Nevada,Bugsy comes up with a notion to create a luxurious casino that would featurepopular entertainers and become the Monte Carlo of the United States. Hepersuades the gang to put up the bucks, and then unwittingly ends up investinghis life making the project work.;   Bugsy's always on the edge, always soclose to letting his life destroy him. You're never sure if his relationshipwith Hill will break up his family or ruin his standing in the gang. Even therelationship itself stands on shaky ground, with Hill always ready to leavehim, with Bugsy so suspicious of her fidelity that he asks a friend to keep aneye on her.;   In addition, his plans for the gambling palace keep gettingstalled, thanks to lack of planning or lack of money or both. Nothing inBugsy's life has certainty except his passion for Hill and his persistentdream of building an oasis in Nevada's desert.;   Beatty gives us a Bugsy withmore complex problems than the movie gangsters we're used to (like, &quot;Should Irat on my friends, should I not rat on my friends?&quot;). We see a many-facetedindividual who shoots in cold blood, who loves his two little girls, whocheats on his wife regularly, who pioneers an empire. Beatty plays the perfectbalance of charisma and manic compulsion that makes Bugsy's life believable.;  Most Mafia movies have dramatic scenes in which the crime boss demonstrateshis power with some violent act that is quickly covered up by his underlings.But Bugsy makes his point with his own persuasive style. After accusingsomeone of stealing money from him, Bugsy launches on a psychotic,reprimanding tirade, during which he loads a gun with a single bullet, spinsthe barrel and points it at his own head. Shouting &quot;You want to kill me? Ican't even kill me,&quot; Bugsy pulls the trigger and smiles.;   If you thinkyou've see all there is to see in a mob movie, &quot;Bugsy&quot; offers surprises. It'sa different take on the crime world and a portrait of one powerful andintriguing individual -- a man whose life story leaves you with a certainamount of respect and admiration. Even if he is a gangster.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Julie Maxson eye teen Review  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  639  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 27, 199100362079,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
