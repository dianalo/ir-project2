Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is generally related to insulation panels, and more      specifically to vacuum insulation panels that have a high degree of      resistance to heat transfer and are thin and bendable to form curved      insulation panels, applications of such panels, and methods of making      same. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  There is nothing new about insulation or in the use of vacuum panels for      insulation. There is, however, a rapidly emerging need for much improved      insulation in terms of a combination of better insulation effectiveness,      lighter weight, thinner, more durable, and more bendable or formable      insulation products. The needs for such better insulation products emanate      from such diverse areas as space-related vehicles and equipment, extremely      low-temperature cryogenic vessels and pipes in scientific and industrial      applications, and even common household appliances. For example, space      vehicles and equipment to be launched into space need a very high quality      of insulation to protect humans and equipment, yet there is no room for      typically bulky insulated walls and panels. </PAR><PAR>  State-of-the-art insulation for cryogenic applications is complex and      expensive and still has significant shortcomings. For example, an      insulation structure known as &quot;cryopumped insulation&quot; is often used for      insulating cryogenic vessels and pipes. Such cryopumped insulation      comprises many laminated layers of impervious material sealed at the edges      and positioned adjacent the cryogenic material; e.g., liquid nitrogen. The      liquid nitrogen is so cold that it causes the air in adjacent sealed      spaces between the laminated sheets to liquify, thus leaving a partial      vacuum in the spaces. This air-liquifying phenomenon occurs through      adjacent layers a sufficient depth into the laminated insulation structure      such that heat transfer is inhibited by the adjacent vacuum layers created      or &quot;cryopumped&quot; in the insulation structures. </PAR><PAR>  While such &quot;cryopumped&quot; insulation works quite well at the extremely low      temperatures of cryogenic materials, like liquid nitrogen, which are cold      enough to liquify air, it does not insulate at all in normal temperature      ranges. Also, such &quot;cryopumped&quot; insulation is relatively thick and bulky,      typically requiring several inches of thickness to be effective, and it is      expensive and difficult to form into desired shapes or contours. Yet,      prior to this invention, there really were no thin, non-bulky, formable,      yet equally effective alternatives. </PAR><PAR>  On the domestic scene, both consumers and governments are demanding that      manufacturer of home appliances, such as refrigerators, water heaters,      dishwashers, washing machines, clothes dryers, and the like, make these      appliances much more energy efficient. For example, the California Energy      Commission has mandated a 50% reduction in the energy use of      refrigerator/freezers to be sold in that state in 1992. That mandated      reduction in energy usage, while maintaining current dimensions, is not      achievable without significant improvement in side-wall thermal      efficiencies. Current technology could accommodate the reduction in heat      transfer through the side walls of appliances by making insulated wall      panels three times as thick. However, people do not want refrigerators      with walls a foot thick. Architectural designs of homes and apartments,      door widths, and the like practically prohibit increasing external      dimensions of home appliances, and decreasing useable interior space will      meet with much consumer dissatisfaction and resistance. </PAR><PAR>  Thinner insulation panels that improve insulating effectiveness would solve      these problems, but ultra-thin, highly effective, and long-lasting      insulation panels are not easy to make. In fact, prior to this invention,      each of these criteria, i.e., ultra-thin, highly effective, and      long-lasting, has been mutually exclusive of at least one of the others. </PAR><PAR>  There have been some notable attempts prior to this invention to improve      insulation effectiveness with somewhat thinner panels. For example, U.S.      Pat. No. 2,989,156, issued to F. Brooks et al., discloses an insulation      panel comprising an evacuated space between metal sheets, which evacuated      space is filled with perlite powder. U.S. Pat. No. 3,151,365, issued to P.      Glaser et. al., shows the use of a mixture of fine carbon black particles      and other fine particles filling an evacuated, enclosed structure,      intermediate foil radiation shields, and an emissivity-reducing coating of      silver. The H. Strong et al., patent, U.S. Pat. No. 3,179,549, uses a mat      of very fine, oriented glass fibers sealed inside an evacuated, welded      metal envelope. The vacuum used is only about 10.sup.-4 atmospheres      (10.sup.-2 Torr), and it requires a fiber mat of sufficient density and      thickness to be opaque to thermal infrared radiation. U.S. Pat. No.      4,444,821, issued to J. Young et al., also discloses an evacuated panel      filled with a glass fiber mat with plastic edge seal strips and a      gettering material positioned in the evacuated chamber. This panel also      specifies only a low-grade vacuum of about 10.sup.-2 Torr. The N.      Kobayashi patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,482, also uses a glass fiber mat      inside a vacuum envelope made of welded stainless steel sheets. This glass      mat is stitched with glass fibers that run perpendicular to the plane of      the mat and are supposed to support the external atmospheric pressure load      on the panel walls to keep them from collapsing. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described prior art vacuum panels are no doubt more effective      than conventional foam and fiberglass insulation panels. However,      constructing a truly effective and long-lasting insulation panel is not      easy and is not achieved by these prior art structures to the extent      necessary to meet the needs described above. For example, the low-grade      vacuums used in the prior art patents cannot achieve insulation      efficiencies high enough for use in ultra-thin panels. Plastic edge seals      cannot maintain a vacuum over an extended period of time, and they really      cannot withstand high-temperature exposure or solar radiation exposure      without serious degradation and outgassing. Metal envelopes with welded      seams will hold the required vacuum, but it is virtually impossible to      achieve the perfectly leak-free welds required for maintaining very      high-grade vacuums over many years, when such welds have to be made in the      presence of the billions of microscopically fine glass fibers and perlite      particles used in prior art panels. A single particle or fiber intruding      into the weld area could create a microscopic leak that would be very      difficult to detect, but would nevertheless seriously compromise the      lifetime of the vacuum inside the sealed insulation panel, thus      compromising the usefulness of the panel. </PAR><PAR>  The use of a vacuum results in the need for a sufficient structure inside      the panel to hold the opposite panel walls from collapsing together. The      glass fiber mats and perlite powders used in the prior art panels      described above can serve that function. However, in high-order vacuums      the inwardly directed sidewall pressures become very great so that such      fiber mats and powders become more tightly compacted, thus offering more      direct heat conduction paths through the insulation panel than desired.      Also, to be really adaptable for a wide variety of uses, the insulation      panel should be bendable around curves. However, bending the prior art      panels would almost certainly crimp one wall sheet of the panel into the      other, thereby forming a &quot;cold short&quot; where one wall or sheet touches the      other. Even if the glass fiber mats of the prior art would physically hold      the two opposite sheets apart, the mat itself would be so compressed at      the crimp or bend that it would virtually form the cold short itself. </PAR><PAR>  The laser-sealed vacuum insulating window invented by David K. Benson, one      of the joint inventors of this invention, and C. Edwin Tracy, now U.S.      Pat. No. 4,683,154, solved the problem of long-term sealing and structural      support against collapse or cold short by laser-welding glass spacer beads      between two glass sheets. However, that structure is quite thick, heavy,      and fragile, being made with glass, and it is rigid, so it cannot be bent      around curves. Therefore, while it is a highly efficient insulation panel,      its utility is limited. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, a general object of the present invention is to provide a      highly effective, ultra-thin insulation panel. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the this invention is to provide a highly effective,      ultra-thin insulation panel that is durable, resistant to degradation,      e.g., by high temperatures, corrosive fluids, and sunlight, and that is      long-lasting and bendable without damage or significant loss of insulating      capability. </PAR><PAR>  A more specific object of this invention is to provide a highly effective,      ultra-thin insulation panel that has superior manufacturability, thus more      consistent, dependable quality at a reasonable cost. </PAR><PAR>  A more specific object of this invention is to provide a monolithic, yet      very effective glass or ceramic spacer for use alone or in combination      with additional similar glass or ceramic spacers in a high-grade evacuated      chamber between two rigid, yet bendable metal sheets forming an insulation      panel, which is easy to manufacture and use. </PAR><PAR>  Another specific object of this invention is to provide a plurality of      discrete glass or ceramic spacers between side sheets that form a vacuum      chamber at predetermined spatial relationships to each other and a method      of positioning such discrete spacers during assembly. </PAR><PAR>  Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention are set      forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will become      apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following      specification or may be learned by the practice of the invention. The      objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by      means of the instrumentalities, combinations, and methods particularly      pointed out in the appended claims. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve the foregoing and other objects and in accordance with the      purposes of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described      herein, the article and apparatus of this invention may comprise two      adjacent metal sheets spaced closely together with a plurality of      spherical glass or ceramic beads or other discrete shapes optimally      positioned between the sheets to provide mechanical support to maintain      the spacing therebetween while minimizing thermal conductance and sealed      with a metal weld around the edges. The glass beads or other shapes can,      according to this invention, be formed in one or more monolithic sheets      and positioned between the metal sheets. One preferred form of such      monolithic sheets includes a sheet of glass web with a plurality of      spherical nodules protruding in opposite directions from the web. Another      preferred form includes a sheet of glass web with a plurality of elongated      ribs protruding in opposite directions from each side. A plurality of such      glass sheets can be laminated between the two outside metal sheets to      further reduce linear heat conductance paths across the panel. A similar      effect can be obtained by providing the two outside metal sheets textured      with ribs or convex protrusions with the two outside sheets separated one      from the other by a flat sheet of glass webbing. Other specific      embodiments of the invention include the insulation panels configured in      particular structures that enhance strength and flexibility, as well as      useful configurations for particular purposes. Another structural      embodiment includes a helical wound glass or ceramic spacer bead that can      be used to separate two concentric, cylindrical metallic sheets in the      shape of a tubular conduit or pipe. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the method of this invention includes using polystyrene-coated      beads positioned in a jig, contacting the beads with one outer metal sheet      heated enough to melt the polystyrene to adhere the beads to the one outer      sheet and lifting them out of the jig, clamping the beads between two      outer metal sheets, heating to break down and outgas the polystyrene and      evacuating to the range of 10.sup.-6 Torr (10.sup.-8 atmosphere), and      sealing by welding the seams around the edges of the outer metal sheets.      One or more low-emissivity surface coatings can be used to minimize      thermal infrared radiation, and a reactive metal getter is installed in      the vacuum insulation to help maintain the vacuum. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and form a part of the      specifications, illustrate the preferred embodiments of the present      invention, and together with the description serve to explain the      principles of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  IN THE DRAWINGS: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a segment of an insulation panel      constructed according to the present invention with a portion of the edge      seam and one side wall cut away to reveal the spacer beads positioned      therein;

The seams around the edges of      the panel where the two outer sheets or walls 12, 14 meet are sealed,      preferably by welding, as shown at 18. The interior chamber 15 enclosed by      the outer sheets or walls 12, 14 is evacuated to a high-grade vacuum in      the range of at least 10.sup.-5 Torr, and preferably to the range of      10.sup.-6 Torr. To hold this high-grade vacuum for many years, the edge      seams 18 have to be sealed with almost perfectly leak-proof quality. </PAR><PAR>  When the chamber 15 is evacuated as described above, the atmospheric      pressure on the outsides of the wall sheets 12, 14 would normally collapse      the wall sheets 12, 14 together, thereby causing a cold short or direct      thermal conduction path from one wall to the other across the panel. To      avoid such collapse, a plurality of discrete glass spacers, which can be      in the form of spherical beads 16, are positioned optimally to provide      mechanical support to hold the two wall sheets 12, 14 apart, while      minimizing thermal conductance. It is preferred that the metal wall sheets      12, 14 be formed of a low thermal conductivity metal such as stainless      steel or titanium, both of which are easily weldable in a vacuum and are      sufficiently hard or rigid so that they do not form around the spherical      spacers, yet are bendable enough so the panel can be formed in curves.      Therefore, a near &quot;point&quot; contact is maintained between each spherical      glass bead spacer 16 and the metal wall sheets 12, 14. For      high-temperature applications, the beads 16 can be ceramic beads instead      of glass, so that they maintain their structural integrity, spherical      shape, and near &quot;point&quot;  contact with the metal walls 12, 14. Therefore,      while this discussion, specification, and claims refer most often to the      monolithic spacers as being glass, it is to be understood that ceramic      spacer materials are also appropriate equivalents and are included within      the scope of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  Once the spacer beads 16 are properly positioned and the chamber 15 is      evacuated, the atmospheric pressure on the outside surfaces of the wall      sheets 12, 14 tightly squeezes or clamps the sheets 12, 14 against the      bead spacers 16, thereby holding them in position. With proper spacing of      the spacer beads 16, the insulation panel 10 can even be bent or formed      around a curve, as shown in FIG. 1, and the spacer beads 16 maintain the      spacing between the wall sheets 12, 14 in the bend without crimping or      allowing a cold short between the two wall sheets 12, 14. </PAR><PAR>  While there may be a number of ways to affix the spacer beads 16 in optimum      spaced relation to each other in the chamber 15, one preferred method of      doing so is illustrated in FIGS. 3 through 5. Specifically, the spacer      beads 16 are initially coated with a polystyrene or similar adhesive      material. These polystyrene-coated beads 16 are then poured onto the      surface of a bead jig 52, which has a plurality of pockets 54 formed in      its surface with the proper spacing as desired for holding the spacer      beads 16. One wall sheet 12 is heated and lowered into position on top of      the spacer beads 16 as shown in FIG. 4. The heat from the wall sheet 12      melts the polystyrene on the surface of the spacer beads 16 to adhere the      beads 16 to the wall sheet 12 as shown at 20 in FIG. 4. The wall sheet 12      is then allowed to cool, thereby allowing the polystyrene to cool and      adhere the spacer beads 20 to the interior surface of the wall sheet 12.      Once adhered, the wall sheet 12 can be lifted off the jig 52, as shown in      FIG. 5, with the beads 16 retained in proper position. Then, the other      wall sheet 14 can be joined as shown in FIG. 2. With the two wall sheets      12, 14 clamped together and with the beads 16 in proper position, the      assembly is then heated to a sufficient temperature to break down the      polystyrene into more volatile styrene monomers, which vaporize at such      temperatures. The temperature should not be so high as to break down the      polystyrene into its carbon elements, because the carbon is higher in      conductivity, and it has a higher infrared emissivity than desired. Under      those temperature conditions, the chamber 15 can be evacuated, and, while      held under the vacuum, the edges 18 can be welded to seal the vacuum in      the chamber 15. </PAR><PAR>  As mentioned above, other methods may also be used to secure the beads in      place while the clamping evacuation and weld sealing operations take      place. For example, with ceramic beads 16 and titanium sheets 12, 14, the      beads 16 may be positioned and maintained with proper spacing      electrostatically. Also, the beads may be held in proper position by a      metal mesh until the outer wall sheets 12, 14 clamp them in place, or they      may be strung on wires or glass fibers. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment 40 shown in FIG. 6 is similar to that shown in FIGS. 1 and 2      above, with the exception that the large spacer beads 16 are positioned on      the bottom wall sheet 14 and held in proper spacing by a plurality of      smaller diameter beads 42. Again, once the top sheet 12 is clamped in      position, the chamber 15 evacuated, and edges 18 welded shut, the spacer      beads 16 will be held in position by the atmospheric pressure on the      outside of the panel. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment 60, as shown in FIG. 7, has the spacer beads 64 formed      as an integral part of a monolithic spacer sheet 62. This monolithic      spacer sheet 62, which is also illustrated in FIG. 8, is one unitary sheet      of glass web 66 with a plurality of spherical nodules 64 extending      outwardly in both directions from the web 66. This monolithic spacer sheet      62 can merely be positioned on the bottom wall sheet 14, and then the top      wall sheet 12 can be placed in position. Once the chamber 15 is evacuated      and the edges 18 sealed, the spacer nodules or spheres 64 will be clamped      into position by the atmospheric pressure. Therefore, it will not make any      difference if the webbing breaks after the panel has been assembled.      Consequently, after assembly, if it is desired to bend the panel 60 around      a curve, which would break the glass web 66, the insulating quality and      structural integrity and spacing between walls 12, 14 of the panel 60      itself will be maintained by the nodules 64. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment 68 shown in FIG. 9 is similar to that shown in FIGS. 7 and      8, with the exception that two of the monolithic spacer sheets 62 are      utilized. The spacer sheets are positioned such that the nodules 64 of one      sheet 62 touch one outside wall sheet 12 and one side of the web 66 of the      adjacent panel on the other side. This embodiment defines a more tortuous      path through a series of &quot;point&quot; contacts in which heat must be conducted      to make it from one side of the panel 68 to the other, thus further      increasing the thermal efficiency thereof. </PAR><PAR>  A similar effect of not having any straight heat conducting paths      transversely through the insulation panel is incorporated in yet another      embodiment 55 as shown in FIG. 10. A single spacer sheet 62 is used, but      hemispherically shaped nodules 57 are spaced so that no nodule 57 touching      outside wall sheet 12 is directly opposite a nodule 57 that touches inside      wall sheet 14. Once again a tortuous path through a series of &quot;point&quot;      contacts, that is, from wall 12 to a nodule 57, through web 66 of sheet 62      to another nodule 57, then to wall 14, is provided. With chamber 15      between walls 12, 14 highly evacuated, this tortuous path once again      provides high thermal efficiency. </PAR><PAR>  Another highly effective insulation panel embodiment 70 according to this      invention is shown in FIGS. 11 through 13. In this embodiment 70, two      monolithic spacer sheets 72, 73 are used, each of which has a plurality of      elongated ribs 75, 74 separated by webs 77, 76, respectively. These      monolithic spacer panels 72, 73 are positioned next to each other so that      the ribs 74 of sheet 72 run perpendicular to the ribs 75 of sheet 73. In      this manner, the ribs 74 of sheet 72 have line contacts with outer wall      sheet 12. Likewise, the ribs 75 of sheet 75 have line contacts with the      other outer wall sheet 14. Such line contacts do make it somewhat more      difficult for heat to flow by conduction. Further, the contacts between      the ribs 74 on sheet 72 and ribs 75 on sheet 73 are essentially &quot;point&quot;      contacts, thus almost negligible heat conductors. </PAR><PAR>  For even higher insulation effectiveness, a plurality of smaller panels      made as described above, such as any of the embodiments 10, 40, 60, 68,      70, can be stacked or laminated together. For example, as shown in FIG.      15, a plurality of panels 10 are stacked or laminated together in a      composite panel 80 by embedding them in, or adhering them to, a more      conventional insulation material 82, such as either rigid or flexible foam      insulation or even a consolidated powder insulation material. The panels      10 are preferably staggered with a layer of the conventional material 82      positioned between each panel 10. This arrangement requires any heat that      traverses the conventional insulation material 82 in the composite panel      80 shown in FIG. 15 to travel a tortuous path as indicated by the arrow      94. An R50 or greater insulation value can be provided with a composite      panel 80 only one inch thick. Composite panels 80 built with this      structure can be easily formed around curves or used in any shape desired. </PAR><PAR>  A number of means are available for increasing the strength and utility of      panels that are fabricated with the principles of embodiment 10 as shown      in FIG. 2. FIGS. 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 illustrate some of these means. </PAR><PAR>  An embodiment 85 in FIG. 16 is based on the principles of embodiment 10 and      provides for corrugations in a direction parallel to the X-axis, as      illustrated in FIG. 16. Spherical nodules 16 or other glass spacers as      described above separate walls 12 and 14, and chamber 15 is highly      evacuated. Welded seal 18 maintains the vacuum. The corrugations keep the      panel 85 rigid in one direction while permitting it to bend in another      direction, as shown in FIG. 17. According to FIG. 16, if embodiment 85 is      generally oriented with the plane formed by the X-Y axes, then the      embodiment is rigid with respect to movement in the X to andplus;Z or X to -Z      directions; and flexible with respect to movement in the Y to andplus;Z and Y to      -Z directions. </PAR><PAR>  An embodiment 87 according to FIG. 18 is also constructed in accordance      with the general principles of embodiment 10 of FIG. 2 or of other      insulated panel embodiments as described above. However, in embodiment 87,      the insulated panel is bent into a cylinder or other enclosing      configuration in which walls 12, 14 overlap at ends 88, 89, thereby      reducing thermal energy loss through welded seams 18. Such ability to bend      the panel and overlap ends provides a thermally efficient means of joining      of ends 88, 89 of embodiment 87 for such uses as wrapping hot water      heaters and other vessels that need to be insulated. </PAR><PAR>  An insulation panel according to the present invention can also be formed      in a rippled tube or conduit embodiment 125, as shown in cross-section in      FIG. 19. The ripples or accordian folds 126 allow this tube or conduit 125      to be curved or bent, as illustrated in FIG. 20, or longitudinally      expanded or contracted, such as to join two immovable rigid conduits 110,      as shown in FIG. 21. </PAR><PAR>  A less flexible insulated tube or pipe embodiment 110 shown in FIG. 22 has      smooth interior and exterior walls 12, 14. Wall 12 forms the outer surface      of the insulated pipe, while wall 14 forms the inner conduit 113.      Separation between walls 12, 14, forming evacuated space 15, is shown in      FIG. 22 maintained by helical glass or ceramic spirals 111, 112, although      other aggregate or monolithic spacer embodiments as described above can      also be used to maintain the vacuum space. A very high thermal insulation      efficiency in thin-wall tubes or pipes can be provided for fluids or      gasses, including cryogenics, flowing or contained within conduit 113 with      this pipe embodiment 110. The ends of lengths of these insulated pipes 110      can be joined together or to conventional pipes by the rippled connector      125, as described above. When the ends 126, 127 of connector 125 overlap      the ends of pipe 110, as shown in FIG. 21, insulation effectiveness is      maintained at these joints, even if they are welded. </PAR><PAR>  Embodiment 115 according to FIG. 23 comprises two corrugated walls, 12, 14,      having elongated ribs or protrusions 122 forming valleys 118 and peaks      119, and a monolithic glass spacer 120, placed between walls 12, 14. Walls      12, 14 are joined by welded seam 18. Wall 12 is oriented so that its ribs      122 form right angles to the ribs of wall 14. Spacer 120 separates the      valleys 118 of wall 12 and wall 14. The right-angle orientation of the      ribs 122 of the respective walls 12, 14 forms essentially very small      dimensional (almost point) direct transverse contacts or heat transfer      paths through the glass spacer 120 where the valleys 118 of the respective      walls 12, 14 cross each other. In this sense, this embodiment is      effectively a structural inverse of the embodiment 70 of FIGS. 11-13 and      described above. The chamber 121 formed under peaks 119 of walls 12, 14 is      evacuated. Such an arrangement provides an insulation panel structure that      is very rigid and possesses great strength in relation to its weight,      while also providing a high degree of thermal insulation. </PAR><PAR>  Embodiment 130 according to FIG. 25 is similar in concept to embodiment 55      of FIG. 10, except that hemispherical nodules 133 are formed on walls 12,      14 of embodiment 130. Spacer 134 is a flat plate of monolithic glass or      ceramic. Welded seam 18 provides a seal to maintain the vacuum of      evacuated chamber 15. Therefore, the panel 130 is generally the structural      inverse of panel 55 and provides similar advantages and insulation      effectiveness. </PAR><PAR>  Still another embodiment 140 is shown in FIG. 26. Embodiment 140 may be      used for thermal-break construction of structural windows. For example, an      I-beam or C-channel 141 may provide the basic structural member.      Surrounding beam 141 and conforming to its shape are two insulated panel      structures 142, 242, for example, constructed similar to that shown in      embodiment 10 of FIG. 2 or according to any of the other suitable panel      structures described above. Thermal break spaces 143, 243 separate      structures 142, 242. Cushion pieces 144, 244 fit snugly against structures      142, providing a seal and providing for differential expansion of glass      panes 145, 147, 148. Glass pane 145 is illustrated as an evacuated, fused      thermal pane window. Such a typical window can also be composed of a      plurality of glass panes 147, 148 edge-sealed by a sealing structure 146,      which may be plastic, metal, or any other suitable material. Compressible      seals 149, 249 assist in preventing air or water leakage. Embodiment 140      thus provides a strong window structure with a frame structure having      highly efficient thermal break properties because of very long thermal      conductance paths. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 26 illustrates a variation of the insulated window mounting structure      of FIG. 25, wherein thermal pane windows 145 are retained in an I-beam      structure 241 by rubber seals 344, 444 between the windows 145 and the      flanges 451 and 452. The insulation panels 342, 442 of this embodiment are      formed into C-shaped cross-sections that mount onto and cover the exposed      surfaces of the respective flanges 451, 452. Each insulation panel 342,      442 can be only 0.1 inch (2.5 mm) thick, yet can have an R15 insulation      value. Therefore, both panels 451, 452 together can provide very neat      appearing--almost imperceptible--R30 insulation on window frames 141 and      other similar structures that otherwise are virtually cold shorts across      building windows. </PAR><PAR>  The beads 16, spirals 101, or monolithic sheets 62, 72, 73, 120, 134 are      preferably fabricated of glass for applications where temperatures are      less than 400.degree. C. for a number of reasons, the most important of      which is the very low outgassing characteristic of glass. Glass also has a      high compressive strength, mechanical rigidity, low thermal conductivity,      and low cost, and it is easy to use in fabrication. Also, glass is      essentially opaque to thermal infrared radiation, which, of course,      minimizes radiation heat transfer across insulation panels 10, 100, 115,      130, particularly where the monolithic spacer sheets 62, 72, 73, 120, 134      are used. In applications where temperatures exceed 400.degree. C., the      beads 16, spirals 101 or monolithic sheets 62, 72, 73, 120, 134 can be      fabricated with a ceramic material. </PAR><PAR>  Optical rejection of heat can also be enhanced by including low-emissivity      coatings 17, 19 of copper, silver, or other low emissivity material,      preferably on the interior surfaces of wall sheets 12, 14, 131, 132. Such      low emissivity materials can also be coated on the surfaces of the      monolithic spacer sheets themselves, particularly where it is not      anticipated that the web 66, 76, 77 or spacers 120, 134 will be broken in      a particular application. A metal getter 21, illustrated in FIG. 2, can      also be placed in the chamber 15 of any of the panel insulation      embodiments described above (although not illustrated in all the figures)      prior to evacuating and sealing the chamber 15. The metal getter traps any      small amount of reactive gas desorbed from glass beads or metal walls that      may occur during the lifetime of many years duration. </PAR><PAR>  The magnitude of the vacuum and its coordination with the width of the      vacuum chamber 15 in all the embodiments described above are important.      Low-grade vacuums in the range of 10.sup.-7 atmospheres (10.sup.-4 Torr)      are inadequate to contribute much to the thermal transfer resistance or      insulating quality of a panel. The flat line 90 in the graph in FIG. 14      illustrates the point that a vacuum does not contribute to any decrease in      the rate of thermal transfer across the panel at all until enough of the      air (or other gases) has been withdrawn to the extent that the mean free      path between collisions of molecules in random motion is at least equal to      the spacing or distance between the hot and cold surface. For ultra-thin,      high-grade insulation panels as contemplated by this invention, at a      vacuum of about 10.sup.-4 Torr, the mean free path is equal to the      distance between the two wall surfaces, as indicated by the bend 92 of the      graph in FIG. 14. At that point, thermal conductivity of the panel 10      decreases, i.e., insulating effectiveness increases, on a fairly linear      basis in direct relation to a decrease in gas pressure in chamber 15, as      indicated by line 94 in FIG. 14. Then, at about 10.sup.-6 Torr, a further      decrease in pressure does not significantly decrease thermal transfer,      because almost all the thermal transfer in that range, indicated by line      96 in FIG. 14, is due to radiation. Accordingly, it is clear from the      description above and from the graph in FIG. 14 that an effective      insulation panel according to this invention may have two hard, but      bendable metal sheets as sidewalls 12, 14 that are spaced a small distance      apart from each other to form a vacuum chamber 15, as shown in FIGS. 1 and      2. The vacuum chamber 15 has the remaining molecules of air or another gas      therein after it has been evacuated, and glass or ceramic spacers 16 are      positioned between the sidewalls 12, 14, as also shown in FIGS. 1 and 2,      to hold the spacing or distance between the sidewall sheets 12, 14.      Further, as described above, there is a relationship between the extent of      the vacuum in the space or chamber 15 between the sidewall sheets 12, 14.      Specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 14, evacuating space 15 between the      sidewall sheets 12, 14 does not enhance insulation effect until the mean      free path between collisions of molecules therein is at least equal to the      distance between sidewall sheets 12, 14. Therefore, in order to not only      take advantage of a vacuum but also maximize the beneficial use of a      vacuum in this kind of insulation application, it is necessary to maintain      a high-grade vacuum with a pressure in the range of 10.sup.-6 Torr or      lower. </PAR><PAR>  For purposes of illustration, the ultra-thin insulation panels according to      this invention can be fabricated very effectively and used very      beneficially in overall thickness in the range of about 0.1 inch (2.5 mm).      The metal wall sheets can be 0.005 to 0.010 inch (0.2 to 0.3 mm) thick,      and the inserts 62, 72, 73 can be thin, rolled glass sheets with regularly      spaced spherical nodules 64 or ribs 74, 75. Gas-phase conduction is nearly      eliminated by sealing the chamber 15 under a high-grade vacuum with a      pressure of only 10.sup.-5 Torr and preferably 10.sup.-6 Torr or less, as      illustrated by FIG. 14 and discussed above. Solid-phase conduction is      minimized by the use of low thermal conductivity material, such as glass,      for mechanical side wall supports or spacers and by the use of nearly      &quot;point&quot; contacts between the supports and the wall sheets, as described      above in relation to the specific structures and embodiments illustrated.      A 0.1-inch (2.5 mm) thick insulation panel, as described above, can have      an insulation value as high as R15, i.e., Randequals;15.degree. F.-hr. ft.sup.2      /BTU, which resists thermal transfer as well as a 21/2-inch thick section      of polymer foam or nearly seven inches of standard-density fiberglass. </PAR><PAR>  By way of illustration, and not of limitation, the following is provided to      illustrate the advantages of the ultra-thin Compact Vacuum Insulation      (CVI) embodiments of the present invention due to such items as its      compactness, effective working temperatures, light weight, and reduction      in the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). </PAR><PAR>  In many applications a premium is paid for volume, and a high-performance      insulation material occupying less volume is therefore more valuable. An      indicator of these applications is provided by the growing substitution of      more-expensive expanded foam products with R-values of 5 to 10 per inch,      or such as fiberglass, rockwool and cellulose, with R-values of 2 to 4 per      inch. Such applications include: refrigerators, freezers; display case      shells for chilled products such as meat, produce, flowers, and liquor;      refrigerated intermodal transport containers; refrigerated truck trailers,      tank, and rail cars; steam and hot and cold water piping; district heating      and cooling piping, industrial process hot and cold storage tanks or      containers; industrial hot and cold process equipment; automobile, train,      plane and ship body shells; building HVAC equipment and ducts; roofs,      walls, and floors of buildings; chilled computer circuits and components;      diurnal and annual cycle storage tanks; portable hot and cold storage and      transport containers; thermal isolation of heat-producing computer      components and other operations; and temperature maintenance of high      temperature processes such as sodium-sulfur batteries and heat-retention      diesels. </PAR><PAR>  The ultra-thin CVI insulation panels and conduits according to this      invention as described above are just as effective in cryogenic process,      transport, and storage situations as the thicker, more complex,      state-of-the-art cryopumped insulation, where a layered multifoil      insulation is continuously vacuum-pumped by thermal absorption by the      extremely cold material itself. However, since the ultra-thin CVI      insulation panels and conduits of the present invention do not rely on      such cryopumping to maintain their insulation effectiveness, they do not      require such energy input or waste. In further contrast, this insulation      according to the present invention is also just as effective in ambient      and high-temperature applications as it is in low-temperature      applications, whereas cryopumped insulation works only at extremely low      temperatures, and the ultra-thin CVI of the present invention is much less      bulky and more flexible than cryopumped insulation. </PAR><PAR>  Related to this cryogenic application is the case of high-temperature      superconductors. As long as superconductivity took place only at cryogenic      temperatures, transmission of electricity was through circuits that      cryo-pumped their multifoil insulating jackets. Such energy drain due to      cryopumping the insulation could be substantial when cryopumping great      lengths of superconductor circuit. Such energy drain could be avoided with      the ultra-thin </PAR><PAR>  CVI insulation of the present invention, as discussed above. Equally as      important, however, is the current on-going development of superconductors      that operate above cryogenic temperatures, yet still need effective      insulation. Since cryopumping does not occur at higher temperatures, the      ultra-thin CVI insulation of this invention may be the only currently      available practical alternative. </PAR><PAR>  Benefits of the relatively lighter weight of the embodiments of the present      invention over prior art insulating materials and techniques include:      lighter-weight, less-expensive machinery is required for fabrication and      handling; lighter-weight fasteners are required for attachment to other      structures; lighter-weight structures are required to hold the present      invention; and less fuel and effort is required to transport the      embodiments, fasteners, and accompanying structure, if any, to which it is      attached or upon which it rests. </PAR><PAR>  By way of further example, existing and prospective insulation products are      compared to an embodiment of the present CVI invention in the following      table: </PAR><TBL>  __________________________________________________________________________     APPROXIMATE VALUES FOR PROTOTYPICAL 17 CUBIC FOOT                              REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER                                                           Type of Insulation     Weight (lb) of                                                                         Volume (ft.sup.3) of                            (R per inch) lbs/ft.sup.3                                                                       lbs/R15/ft.sup.2                                                                     R15 Insulation                                                                         R15 Insulation                                  __________________________________________________________________________     Loose-fill fiberlgass (R3)                                                                   2  0.83  35.3    17.50                                           Polyurethane foam (R7)                                                                       2  0.35  14.9    7.70                                            Perlite powder                                                                              14  7.00  297.5   21.30                                           (in atm.

The CFC      used to &quot;blow&quot; (or expand) the foam escapes from the foam over time,      gradually rising to the stratosphere where, over a 50-year life, it acts      as a catalyst in the destruction of 50,000 times its weight of ozone. </PAR><PAR>  Besides the present invention being a direct substitute in many      applications for CFC-blown insulating foam, its other attributes of light      weight, compactness, non-flammability, non-toxicity, low-cost, etc., make      it beneficial to increase the R-values presently utilized in appliances      and other applications, as well as those now being proposed. In the many      cases where the thermal envelope is enclosing spaces of products chilled      by standard vapor-compression equipment with CFC working fluid, or      refrigerant, the present invention allows for a down-sizing of the vapor      compression equipment, and a resulting reduction in the amount of CFC      refrigerant, as well as energy, needed to achieve and maintain the desired      cool or chilled temperatures in the enclosed spaces. With the reduction of      CFCs in compression equipment combined with replacement of CFC-emitting      materials with CVI as insulation, refrigeration equipment and other CFC      insulation methods can be eliminated as a major source of CFC pollution. </PAR><PAR>  A further advantage of the embodiments of this invention having corrugated      designs is to enhance the ability to bend the CVI in the direction normal      to the direction of the corrugated ribs as shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 and      described above. This corrugated configuration allows easy forming of the      insulation panel around cylindrical tanks. The corrugation also reduces      contact with a rigid, non-corrugated exterior or interior surface to      essentially a number of line contacts, which further thermally isolates      the object being insulated. In the case of insulated piping or ducting,      such corrugated insulation panels will allow bending of the piping or      ducting while maintaining a very strong &quot;hoop strength&quot; design against      collapse. </PAR><PAR>  Another application for the ultra-thin compact vacuum insulation is related      to the recent improvements in glazings. From an R-value of about 1 for      single glazing, and about 2 for standard double glazing, designs and      prototypes have appeared within the last 5 years for advanced glazings      with R-values of 3 to 10. One result of these advances is that more      attention has been focused on the window frame itself, which can account      for as much as 30% of the total fenestration &quot;rough opening&quot; in a building      envelope, yet is often essentially a cold short between the interior and      the exterior of the building. Wood and vinyl-clad wood frames are modest      improvements, with maximum total R-values approaching 5. However,      considering the effect of the window frames on R-value integrated over the      entire fenestration area, much more improvement would be beneficial. The      ultra-thin compact vacuum insulation panel window frame coverings or caps      142, 242 shown in FIG. 25 and 342, 442 shown in FIG. 26 and described      above can achieve R30 insulation values when installed on both the      interior and exterior sides of the window frame, and R15 when installed on      only one side with as little as 0.1 inch (2.5 mm) panel thickness. </PAR><PAR>  The table below compares the effects of frames of different R-values on the      integrated R-value of the fenestration opening. </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         Integrated R-values for 10 ft.sup.2 Window                                                 Frame R-value                                                      Glazing R-Value                                                                            (30% Coverage)                                                     (70% Coverage)                                                                             1      2      4    8     16    32                                  ______________________________________                                         1           1.0    1.2    1.3  1.4   1.4   1.4                                 2           1.5    2.0    2.4  2.6   2.7   2.8                                 4           2.1    3.1    4.0  4.7   5.2   5.4                                 8           2.6    4.3    6.3  8.0   9.7   10.6                                16          2.9    5.2    8.5  12.5  16.0  19.6                                ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  The foregoing description is considered as illustrative only of the      principles of the invention.
