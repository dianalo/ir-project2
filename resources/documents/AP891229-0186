The small rise in the department's Index of Leading EconomicIndicators for November followed a revised 0.3 percent decline inOctober.   In all, the index, which is designed to forecast economicactivity six to nine months in the future, has exhibited a sawtoothpattern this year, rising in six of the past 11 months and fallingin the other five months.   Through November, the index was down by 0.3 percent for theyear, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent for all of 1988.   To economists, this provided evidence that economic activity in1990 will be more sluggish than in 1989.   Many analysts are predicting that the economy, as measured bythe gross national product, will expand at a modest annual rate of2 percent or less in 1990, compared with expected growth of 3percent this year.   However, analysts generally expect the economy will be able toescape a recession. That belief based in part on the fact that theleading index has not yet declined for three consecutive months,the traditional _ though not infallible _ sign of a downturn.   The 0.1 percent rise in November, which was right in line withexpectations, was led by a strong jump in orders for consumergoods. The other four indicators providing strength were a drop inweekly unemployment claims, an increase in plant and equipmentorders, a rise in the money supply and an increase in the backlogof manufacturers' unfilled orders.   Six other indicators acted as a drag on the index last month,with the biggest negative coming from a drop in the price of rawmaterials. While such a decrease is considered good news forinflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the indexbecause it also can reflect declining demand.   Other negative factors were a decline in stock prices, a drop inconsumer confidence, a decline in the average manufacturing workweek, a decline in building permits and a speedup in businessdelivery times.   The various changes left the index at 144.7 percent of its 1982base of 100.   The gross national product grew at an annual rate of 3 percentin the July-September quarter, but economists believe the growthrate slowed dramatically in the current October-December quarter.   Frank McCormick, senior economist at the Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said the GNP probably expanded at an annual rate of just1.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The government will not releaseits own estimate of this growth rate until next month.   Some analysts are even more pessimistic, fearing that the GNPmay not have expanded at all and instead registered a smallnegative number. The most pessimistic say the economy may suffer asmall recession with negative growth in both the fourth quarter andthe first quarter of next year.   But McCormick discounted this minority view, contending that theFed's easing efforts have come in time to keep alive the expansionfollowing the 1981-82 recession, a recovery which already haslasted a peacetime record of seven years.   ``We think we have gone through the slowest growth already thisquarter and the economy will be gradually picking up through nextyear,'' he said.   That forecast would be good news for the Bush administration,which is counting on continued growth to boost government revenuesand help reduce the federal deficit without a tax increase.</TEXT></DOC>
