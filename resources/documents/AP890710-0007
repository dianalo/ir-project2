Humes High Schoolprom in Memphis, Tenn.   ``So we sat and talked and drank Cokes all night.''   Elvis, then an 18-year-old senior and still a few years frompelvis-swinging stardom, lived in the same housing project asVaughn, then 14. They dated for about four months.   Now 50, Vaughn is married and lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Shetalked about her dream dates with Elvis in this week's Peoplemagazine.   ``I kissed Elvis every night from the second date on,'' she said.``But the nuns at my school told us we shouldn't allow boys to kissus with their mouths open.   ``So I'll just say Elvis gave me long kisses prom night. Youcould say we made out. But he never tried to go farther. He wasn'tlike that.''   Vaughn said she and her family moved from Memphis a few weeksafter the prom and she never saw Presley again.   Presley died in 1977.</TEXT><DATELINE>RACINE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Medieval history buffs donned armor andbrandished bamboo swords in a midsummer's escape into the past.   About 225 members of the Society for Creative Anachronismgathered this weekend at Bong Recreational Area for archery,leatherworking, shield bending and seminars in the history of theMiddle Ages.   Assuming ersatz medieval names like Lord Aeddan ab Rhys, M'LadyBrigit, and Anna-Maria Taubeneck, the fighters crossed swords andmatched jousting skills in battles whose only prize was honor.   Patricia Craig, a computer programmer, was one of the organizers.   As its name suggests, the group does not take itself tooseriously, she said.   ``We learn to overlook non-Middle Ages stuff in our midst, likelights and plumbing,'' she said. And ``we are much more into honor,chivalry and courtesy than they were.''   Ms. Craig said close to 30,000 people nationally are involved inthe movement to remember and recreate the Middle Ages.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ellie Mae, who as the mascot of the 1988Republican National Convention rubbed noses with the powerful, isgiving the cold shoulder to her fellow pachyderms.   ``Ellie Mae's wary around other elephants,'' said James Holston,the elephant supervisor at the Audubon zoo. ``She's kind ofstand-offish and shy because she's not used to them.   ``She's more used to people than elephants,'' Holston said.   The African elephant, captured in 1986 and sent from Zimbabwe toNew Orleans before August's convention, was trained to get along incrowds of people.   ``We started by taking her out when the zoo wasn't open,''Holston said. ``Then we took her around to be with people.''   By the end of August, she'd been on three television networks'morning shows, had been presented to then-President Reagan and VicePresident Bush and invited to countless soirees.   Ellie Mae, a 3-year-old, 1,200-pound youngster when she arrivedin New Orleans, has gained 400 pounds and stands nearly 5 feet tallat the shoulder.   She's still a hit on the party circuit and is part of the zoo'scampaign to educate people about the poaching of elephants for ivoryand the danger they may become extinct.   Ellie Mae has her own quarters but soon may be penned with theother elephants.   The transition from star to one of the herd is a gradual one,Holston said.</TEXT></DOC>
