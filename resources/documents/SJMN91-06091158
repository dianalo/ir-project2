It does so by basically acting as an interpreter that reads theimages aloud.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TEACHING ICONS TO TALKBLIND USERS AWAIT GRAPHICS ADVANCES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO><TEXT>     The prototype program for the blind at International Business MachinesCorp. is called Screen Reader for Presentation Manager.;    It is beingdeveloped by James W. Thatcher, a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. WatsonResearch Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.;    Thatcher is one of a handful ofU.S. researchers seeking innovative ways to keep advances in computersavailable to the blind.;    &quot;Blind people are concerned that they will lookback at the 1980s as the zenith of their access to computers,&quot; Thatcher said.&quot;There is a real fear that they will be cut off.&quot;;    Existing softwareprograms and reading devices can convert words and numbers typed on a computerscreen into synthesized speech.;    But the new program is designed to handlethe especially complex task of recognizing the internal coding used to formpictures and then convert that data into digital information that allows thespeech-reader to recite what it &quot;sees.&quot;;    By doing so, the program givesblind people access to a kind of software, the graphic user interface, that isfast becoming the operating system of choice for personal-computer users.;   The most popular program is Windows, from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.,which is expected to sell 7 million packages this year.;    That would easilymake it one of the best-selling programs ever produced.;    Graphic softwarevirtually eliminates the need to type in lines of letters and other charactersto find and run programs or change files.;    Instead, computer users choosefrom lists and symbols.;    Such programs typically use images like a filecabinet to represent stored files, a trash can as a symbol for deleting oldfiles, a typewriter as a symbol for a writing program, and so on.;    TheMacintosh computers from Cupertino-based Apple Computer Inc. have longdisplayed commands this way, but it took recent technical refinements to makesuch programs work smoothly with computers made by IBM, Compaq Computer Corp.of Houston and others.;    Thatcher's program is still in the developmentstage, and commercial sales could be a long way off.;    But for ChristopherChaltain, a blind programmer at IBM's East Fishkill, N.Y., plant, theprototype arrived none too soon.;    A move is under way inside IBM to shiftthe company's personal computer users from MS-DOS computing standards to OS/2,IBM's next-generation operating system.;    For PC users who can see, programslike IBM's OS/2-based Presentation Manager, Microsoft's Windows 3.0 and XWindows for Unix represent the next wave of computing.;    But for blindcomputer users like Chaltain, the use of graphics and pictures -- instead of akeyboard -- is a formidable barrier.;    It threatens to shut out thousands ofvisually impaired users who cannot navigate screens of pull-down menus,multiple windows and colorful graphics.;    &quot;My department is moving to OS/2,and without being able to move that way as well, I eventually won't be able tocontinue in my current job,&quot; Chaltain said.;    His problem is shared by anestimated 123,000 working-age blind or severely visually impaired personalcomputer users, according to the American Foundation for the Blind.;    Fueledby the success of programs like Microsoft's Windows 3.0, which has spentmonths on the software best-seller lists since its May 1990 introduction,software based on the graphic user interface is gaining in popularity.;   Analysts foresee a time within this decade when such software will completelyreplace today's popular programs.;    &quot;This is a serious issue for blindusers,&quot; says Gregg C. Vanderheiden, director of the Trace Research andDevelopment Center at the University of Wisconsin.;    &quot;By the year 2000, 100percent of software will be graphics-based.&quot;;    &quot;I'm a consultant, and Idon't know enough about Windows 3.0,&quot; says Bob Gildea, a computer con-sultantin Arlington, Mass., who is legally blind.;    &quot;How can I advise clients ifI'm precluded from using it myself?&quot; he asks. &quot;It's very frustrating.&quot;;    Forthe 3.5 million blind or visually impaired Americans, innovative on-lineservices like Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Prodigy are inaccessible because theyrely on a graphic user interface.;    To gain access to programs like Windows,developers face a host of technological barriers.;    Foremost is how totranslate the data on the screen into speech.;    Character- or text-basedsystems depend fundamentally on a text-display buffer, a part of computermemory that stores a number for each position on the screen.;    Aspeech-reader program for the blind can direct the computer to send thatnumber from the text-display buffer to a voice synthesizer to be spoken to theblind user.;    So the computer can read back letters, words and sentences andprovide spoken directions.;    Such systems have allowed blind users to workin a variety of jobs that were once cut off from them, like programming, dataentry and word processing.;    But graphics-based systems do not have atext-display buffer.;    Characters and graphics are represented in memory bydots, called pixels.;    To form a letter, a block of pixels is essentiallypainted on the screen.;    It may look like an &quot;A,&quot; but there is no way totell a voice synthesizer to read that letter, because it has no numericrepresentation.;    So the question for developers is: How can an accesssoftware program interpret what is on the screen and convey that informationto the voice synthesizer?;    Both Thatcher and Wesley L. Boyd, president andlead programmer for Berkeley Systems Inc. in Berkeley, have adopted a similarmodel to accomplish the task.;    The approach is to intercept the commandsthat draw and erase text before these commands reach the screen, and tomaintain a special text buffer called the &quot;off-screen model.&quot;;    From thisoff-screen model, the information can be translated and sent to a voicesynthesizer.;    Boyd's work has already resulted in a product calledOutspoken, which allows blind users to work with Apple's Macintosh.;   Outspoken was introduced in late 1989 and last year received aComputerworld-Smithsonian award for innovative technology.;    Vanderheiden,working with Berkeley Systems, is also developing a graphic interface for theMacintosh at the Trace Research and Development Center.;    His work is themost ambitious, because he is incorporating a device that allows blind usersto feel representations of screen images.;    The device, which he calls a&quot;virtual tactile mouse,&quot; converts optical images to tactile ones usingvibrating pins that let the user move around the screen and feel the edge of awindow or the height of a chart.;    With this device, blind users will haveaccess to graphs, charts and other pictorial data that they have never beforebeen able to use.;    Vanderheiden is also adding three-dimensional sound,using the stereo speakers of the Macintosh.;    Spoken words and tones willcome from right or left, or from up or down, so the blind user will be able tonavigate the screen more easily.;    But among the blind and visuallyimpaired, the IBM personal computers and their &quot;clones&quot; have been theoverwhelming choice and have spawned a vast network of programs for theblind.;    Those eagerly awaiting Thatcher's Screen Reader might have quite await.;    The system, only in the prototype stage, is being tested by blindusers within IBM.;    It needs to be refined and then shifted to IBM's SpecialNeeds Systems Group to become a marketable product.;    &quot;There's no commitmentto it as a product yet,&quot; Thatcher said, while insisting that the prototype wasvery advanced.;    &quot;Right now, it's just a research project,&quot; he added. &quot;Butmy commitment is very strong, and the blind community really wants it.&quot;;   Thatcher is already thinking beyond the product stage.;    He is hopeful thathis off-screen model will become a standard so that developers can easilyconvert their software programs to systems for the blind.;    He is in contactwith Microsoft, for example, to explore the possibility of adapting hisprototype program to Windows 3.0.;    Greg Lowney, program manager for Windowsat Microsoft, said that company was eager to provide access to Windows butcould not make a commitment until IBM formally announced a program.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN RIFKIN, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910331  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,453  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 31, 199100091158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
