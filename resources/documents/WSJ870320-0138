He's more no-frills 1950s than Yuppified 1980s, more meat-and-potatoes than &quot;cuisine minceur&quot;, more comfortable in blue suit, white shirt and red tie than in the fashions of the times.    If he were a movie star, he'd be Spencer Tracy -- not Cary Grant and certainly not one of the casually dressed and startlingly young-looking box-office biggies of today. Like Tracy, he carries extra weight around his waist, and like Tracy, he owns up to it.    He's a man for the long haul. Almost one-third of the 351 respondents to a Wall Street Journal survey on executive style said they have never worked for a company other than the one they now lead. And 43% of them were with their company for more than 16 years before becoming CEO.    The survey -- which targeted the CEOs of the Fortune 500 industrial companies and 350 of the Fortune 500 service companies -- found that in their personal lives as well as their business careers, these men go against the grain of the evanescent 1980s.    In a time when it seems that all sorts of things from automobiles to relationships don't last as long as they used to, more than 80% of the CEOs have been married only once, and roughly the same percentage have been married longer than 20 years. Just over a third have four or more children -- a plurality over those who have two or three. (A tiny 4% have only one child, and 2% have none.)    All of the survey respondents were male; so few women lead large U.S. corporations that many survey questions were written with a male respondent in mind, angering some women who read them. Not only has the women's movement not put women at the top of the nation's largest corporations, it also hasn't had much impact on chief executives' spouses. More than 90% of respondents' spouses in the survey don't work outside the home.    The fathers of today's CEOs had a wide range of careers -- policemen, doctors, lawyers, journalists, engineers. But more had business executives for fathers than anything else.    They come from all regions of the U.S., but none of the respondents grew up in Maine, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska or Hawaii. New York produced 15% of the chief executives, the highest single-state total. Just under 3% of them grew up abroad.    Their personal habits wouldn't surprise a Rip Van Winkle waking up after snoozing through the upheavals of the '60s and '70s -- except, perhaps, for the lack of cigarette smoke in the executive suite. Only 7% smoke cigarettes.    But they like to have a drink. Only 8% are teetotalers. For the rest, the most popular drinks are wine and Scotch. A martini is the drink of choice for only 7%.    These clearly are affluent men. They like expensive cars, and for all their Main Street traits, almost half of them are deserting Detroit for foreign car makes. Overwhelmingly, the first cars they ever bought were Fords and Chevys. But now, only half of them prefer U.S.-built autos. On their wrists, you're most likely to find a Seiko watch.    When they buy the blue suits, white shirts and red ties they favor, they're most likely to get them at Brooks Brothers. Still, a quarter of them have suits and shirts custom made, and a good sprinkling favor tailors in London or Hong Kong. Another sprinkling have stuck to less glamorous haberdasheries such as Wallach's.    But a few break away from the pattern of their peers to indulge an offbeat hobby. There's a bagpiper and a couple of banjo players. Two men list curling among their favorite sports. A handful relax by cooking. Two raise orchids, and one carves duck decoys.    ---   City Life   If you could live in any city, where would it be?     1. San Francisco    2. (tie) London       New York    4.
