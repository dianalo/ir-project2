Prosecutors said they had opened a criminal investigation of aDuesseldorf company that allegedly contracted to deliver more than250 tons of a mustard gas component to Iran.   Officials have said that the Rheineisen Chemical Productscompany, run by an Iranian family, was contracted to arrange theshipment by Iran's state-owned industrial organization Vezarate Defa.   A company official, Mojtar Ashtari, said Thursday night in aninterview with the West German TV network ZDF that the company hadcomplied with export regulations before making the deal final.   ``We were given the green light by the export licensingauthorities for this shipment,'' said Ashtari, a buyer forRheineisen who helped arange the deal.   He said Rheineisen had no indication the chemical would be usedto produce poison gas, adding that the shipment was halted and wouldbe returned to Bombay, India, were it originated.   Six months ago, an international furor arose over involvement byWest German firms in building a plant in Libya the United Statessaid was designed to produce chemical weapons. Libya said it was apharmaceuticals factory.   After disclosure of the Libyan project, Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sgovernment said it it would take legal steps to prevent a recurrence.   On Thursday, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said he wouldmake sure there are no ``loopholes'' in the new measures.   ``Such corrections are completely possible as a result of furtherdiscussions of the law,'' he said in an interview with Saarlandstate radio.   The government has expanding the list of weapons-related productsthat require a special export permit, and also is trying to cut downon transactions conducted by West German companies outside thecountry.   In addition to the chemical deals, West German firms also aresaid to be involved in illegal shipments of arms to several foreigncountries.   Parliament will consider more regulations, including larger finesand longer prison terms for violators, when it returns from summerrecess.   ``In the future we will be able to catch and punish such cases,and eliminate them from West Germany,'' Haussmann said.   Federal authorities have arrested Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen,whose company Imhausen-Chemie allegedly played a centrol in buildingthe Libyan plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli.   As in the case of the Libyan plant, the United States gave Bonnthe first tip about the scheduled shipment of the mustard gaschemicals to Iran.   Rheineisen is run by an Iranian family, company attorney GeorgGreeven told reporters.   Rolf Chanteaux, chief state prosecutor in Duesseldorf, told TheAssociated Press on Thursday he had begun a criminal investigationof the company.   ``The facts show that the Rheineisen firm agreed on a deliverycontract for the chemical, rather than just a broker's contract,''he said. ``A special permit is needed for a delivery contract.''   Chanteaux said the company had not obtained a permit for thechemical, which was to be delivered to Iran from a company in India.   Rheineisen says it canceled the contract for arranging deliveryof 257 tons of thionyl chloride to Iran from a company in Indiacalled Transpec, and there would be no shipment.   Under an agreement reached on June 1, Rheineisen was to receive$360,000 from Iran. Rheineisen has said West German customsofficials assured the company there was nothing wrong with shippingthionyl chloride to Iran.   Both Iran and Iraq used poison gas in their eight-year war, whichbegan in September 1980. A cease-fire was reached in August.</TEXT></DOC>
