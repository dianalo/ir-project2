(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL bankruptcy trustee David Clarkannounced his resignation Friday after a ``gallant'' butunsuccessful attempt to keep the scandal-tainted organizationintact.   ``I came here in November to do all in my power to preserve andreorganize the PTL ministry and Christian retreat,'' Clark said ina letter Friday to U.S. Trustee John Waites, a justice departmentofficial in Columbia who presides over bankruptcy cases.   ``It is now clear that much of PTL must be sold to paycreditors,'' Clark, 47, said. ``Although I have no desire topreside over the sale of PTL assets, I maintain a strong commitmentto the survival of the ministry and I hope to be of assistance tothat end.''   Clark's resignation was provided for in a revised reorganizationplan filed with the federal bankruptcy court Monday, but no timewas specified. The filing outlined plans to sell the Heritage USAtheme park in Fort Mill and lease the property required to carry onits church and television ministry to a separate corporation.   In the court filing, Clark had blamed the financial failure on adrop in contributions after the ``various scandals'' and warned,``Because of past scandals and credibility problems, PTL and othertelevision ministries are facing extinction.''   If the new reorganization terms are approved by the bankruptcycourt, Clark would stay on as initial president of the non-profitcorporation, Heritage Ministries Inc., that would run the churchand cable television network. Later, a board of directors woulddetermine who would serve as permanent president.   Clark had previously served as vice president of marketing atthe Christian Broadcasting Network.   In addition to sending the letter to Waites, Clark announced hisresignation on the ``PTL Club'' TV show Friday and told viewers heis taking a week's vacation. He did not indicate whether he wouldcontinue as host of the show.   Clark could not be reached for comment later Friday. His officesaid he had gone for the day.   He is the third television evangelist to resign as head of PTLin 14 months. Jim Bakker, who founded PTL in 1974, resigned inMarch 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal and turned the ministryover to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority.Falwell resigned in October 1987 amid disenchantment with hisleadership.   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds approved Clark'sresignation and the appointment of M.C. Benton to succeed Clark astrustee to manage the day-to-day operations of PTL, Waites said.   Benton, former mayor of Winston-Salem, N.C., has served as PTL'sexecutive vice president for accounting and operational affairssince Feb. 1.   PTL, approximately $130 million in debt, filed forreorganization and protection from creditors in bankruptcy court inJune 1987. The ministry's assets are valued at $160 million.   ``Dr. Clark made a gallant effort to ensure the successfulreorganization of PTL,'' Waites said. ``Considering the problemswhich preceded him at PTL, and the troubled times for televisionministries generally, the financial support of PTL during Clark'stenure was impressive.''   However, PTL failed to raise enough money to make the initialpayment of its debt as required under a reorganization plan filedin December. A modified reorganization plan filed Monday called forthe trustee to liquidate the assets of PTL to the extent necessaryto pay creditors.   Two parties interested in buying PTL are George Shinn, a sportsentrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C., who wants to build aprofessional baseball and basketball complex; and FamilyEntertainment America, a California-based corporation with links toBakker.   FEA will make a bid by the end of next week to take over theassets of PTL, according to various officials with the firm.   Bakker told the Los Angeles Times, in a story publishedThursday, that FEA offers ``the best hope on the table at thismoment'' for him and his wife, Tammy, to return to PTL.   However, FEA spokesman Kerry Moody said the organization has notinvited Bakker ``to come back in any capacity.''</TEXT></DOC>
