One of the factors it cited was the increased anti-unionactivity of employers. The National Labor Relations Actfrowns on managers who fire union supporters or otherwiseopenly display their hatred for labor organizations. But freespeech is still free speech, and company supervisors stillcan explain why they think a union might be bad for thecompany.</LP><TEXT>   Increasing competition, particularly from imports, hasmade companies anxious to keep out unions and thus have afree hand in fighting the competition -- or so a number ofeconomists claim. But Leo Troy, a Rutgers Universityeconomist, claims that picture is at best incomplete.   Mr. Troy, writing in the Harvard Journal of Law and PublicPolicy, agrees that competition has increased substantiallyin the past two decades. But the most important result ofthis increase has not been to turn employers intounion-haters. It has been, instead, to force major changes inthe structure of business and industry. According to aWashington Post poll published in late 1987 and a 1984 LouHarris poll, a large majority of nonunion workers feel theydon't need unions and that unions don't make sense for theirjobs. The Post survey said 62% of the nonunion workerssurveyed did not think they would be fired if they supportedforming a union.   Structural shifts have changed the occupational mix of anenterprise or an industry by moving employment fromproduction to white-collar jobs. Furthermore, such shiftshave expanded employment in firms or industries relyingprimarily on white-collar, nonunion occupations; engineers,lawyers and architects are samples. The structural shiftssharply reduce the numbers of employees who are likely to beeager for union membership. Such workers are likely to feelthat unions are irrelevant -- that they can do betterbargaining for themselves.   What should the unions do about this? Some analysts,convinced that employers are the villains in the uniondecline, argue for increased government intervention in labormarkets. Most of the proposals would change the procedure forholding elections to determine whether a nonunion group ofemployees should be unionized. The process, overseen by theNational Labor Relations Board, can be lengthy, like anythingthat makes its way through government bureaucracy. Someanalysts argue that this process should be bypassed with&quot;instant elections.&quot; But if workers think unions areirrelevant, they won't change their minds merely because theyare given the chance to say so more quickly.   None of the critics of the National Labor Relations Act goso far as to suggest that it should be replaced by somethinglike the Railway Labor Act. Yet the railway unions wouldappear to have a few advantages. For one thing, the SupremeCourt in 1956 exempted them from state laws banning the unionshop. As a result, more than 90% of the railway workers areunionized.   There's a major catch, however. Neither the Supreme Courtnor any other governmental entity can exempt railway unionsfrom the structural changes that have swept through therailroad industry, as private cars, buses, airplanes andtrucks have replaced trains. Sure, more than 90% of railwayworkers are unionized, but in the past 40 years the number ofworkers has fallen by about 60%.   Change hasn't been so drastic in most industries, butchange is continuing. Mr. Troy suggests that fresh governmentintervention in labor relations would probably be quickly&quot;repealed&quot; by structural economic change or competition.   Mr. Troy, however, does think the unions have a future.They will have no particular appeal to workers earning$15,000 a year or more. But polls indicate that a majority ofworkers earning less than $15,000 still support unions. Theseworkers are still mainly in production jobs demanding onlylimited skills and offering few chances for advancement.   Although Mr. Troy thinks unions still have some shrinkingto do, he believes they can remain an important factor in theeconomy. For all of its troubles, Mr. Troy notes, the U.S.union movement is still the largest and wealthiest in theFree World.   Union aspirations to become even bigger and wealthier,however, focus on recruiting -- and retaining -- workers whohave gained from technological change. Although idealistsmight claim that unions exist to help the downtrodden, theyhave made their past gains primarily by recruiting from themiddle and upper echelons of labor, and they are likely tosee no reason to proceed differently now.   Private-sector union density (percentage of workers inunions) now is about 12%, and Mr. Troy thinks it will fall toabout 8% at the beginning of the next century, about where itwas a century earlier. If unions don't aim their recruiting abit lower, their future may be even bleaker.</TEXT></DOC>
