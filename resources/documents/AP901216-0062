(AP) - There is sex galore in thismagazine.   There is homosexuality and bisexuality and bestiality andmiscegenation and just about every other permutation of sexualconduct known to men and women.   But don't contact the authorities. The treatment thesesensational topics receive in the gray pages of the Journal of theHistory of Sexuality is more likely to send the average reader to athesaurus than a cold shower.   ``It's scholars talking to other scholars about research andimportant scholarly studies using all of the methodology andapproaches that are used in social science research,'' said RobertShirrell of the University of Chicago Press, publisher of thejournal. ``It's not going to be, nor would it serve its function ifit were, a publication for a general audience.''   Articles in the first two issues covered such subjects as ``HolyHarlots,'' a study of prostitute saints in medieval Europe; thehomosexual habits of actors on the 18th century London stage; andearly writings and research on syphilis in 15th and 16th centuryEngland.   Studies of Old Norse sexuality and marriage rituals inmodern-day Morocco have been lined up for future issues.   The quarterly journal is edited by John Fout, 53, a professor ofmodern European history at Bard College, a small liberal artsschool 100 miles north of New York City.   While researching sexual politics topics such as the forcedsterilization policies of Nazi Germany, Fout said he discovered nojournal on sex was devoted to the works of scholar-authors likehimself.   Studies in the field were dominated instead by sexologists -researchers like Masters and Johnson doing medically based studiesof sexual behavior - or by pyschologists working on the mentalaspects of sexuality, Fout said.   He said he decided to start a new journal that would ``publishthe best and the newest and the most critical theoreticalscholarship from scholars around the world.''   The journal, which debuted in July, is the 51st scholarlypublication produced by the University of Chicago Press.   Fout said the works in his journal represent a largely new andunconventional way of looking at the sexual history of mankind.   Most of the study of human sexuality during the past generationhas centered on ``how the body works,'' he said. The studies in hisjournal examine instead the way sexual behavior has been molded bythe influences within society and culture, such as religion,politics and government.   For instance, an article in the second issue of the journalexplores the condom's struggle for legal and social acceptance in20th century America. Author Joshua Gamson said his research only``peripherally'' deals with sex, and that it might have beendifficult to get his piece published in a science-based sexualjournal.   ``There aren't many places where I could have placed an articleon condoms,'' said Gamson, 27, a doctoral student at the Universityof California, Berkeley.   The journal does not pay contributors. Scholars whose articlesor book reviews are published are offered 10 free copies of theissue or a year's free subscription, an arrangement that Fout saidis standard for such publications.   So far, the journal has about 1,000 paid subscribers,respectable for a first-year publication, Shirrell said. Mostcopies can be found in college libraries. Fout said a fewbookstores have agreed to sell the journal.   ``We undertake publications with the expectation that they willcontinue indefinitely,'' Shirrell said. ``This is going to be animportant area for academic research for a number of years.''</TEXT></DOC>
