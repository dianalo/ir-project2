 There are several reasons: using a camera is often less expensive andjust as fast as digitally processing a photo, and there is no qualityimprovement in using a scanner rather than an art camera.andP;  In the past, thebenefits of processing halftones digitally have been realized in retouching,reusing photos and merging halftones with text to output complete pages--noneof which typically is done electronically in the daily newspaper setting.andM;In the 1980s, newspapers made increasing use of computers for graphics, suchas charts and graphs.andP;  The Apple Macintosh became a staple of many an artdepartment, particularly since the Associated Press began distributingweather maps and graphics as Macintosh graphics files.andP;  The surge innewspaper color has spurred the adoption of color prepress systems forprocessing color photos.andP;  Most papers rely on the established high-endvendors for their color systems, but a growing number are experimenting withdo-it-yourself systems built by piecing together off-the-shelf software andhardware.andM;Traditional black-and-white photos, which account for the bulk of photos inmost daily newspapers, have remained the last holdout.andP;  It has appeared asthough the papers were waiting for an event to spark the digital revolutionof their camera departments.andP;  That event has just happened, and it now looksas though the 1990s will be the decade in which newspapers computerize theirblack-and-white photography and art departments.andM;The event is the Associated Press decision to replace its analog wirereceivers with an electronic darkroom as the basic wire photo receiver at allof its 950 U.S.andP;  subscribers.andP;  This means that every AP member paper willhave the facility for receiving and processing its photos in digital form.andO;With this facility in place, there will be a natural migration toward digitalprocessing of local photos--whether through still video photography orscanners--which will in turn spur demand for full pagination systems throughwhich complete pages can be output ready for making plates.andM;Total newspaper pagination has loomed like a barbed-wire-topped fence forover a decade.andP;  But the adoption of PostScript for full-page imaging hasresolved the output issue for many users.andP;  Once papers begin processing theirphotographs digitally, they will have a strong incentive for quicklyimplementing total pagination.andM;Because AP's decision marks a milestone in the newspaper industry, we dedidedto present an overview of its system, including the recent additionsintroduced at the Digital Photography Conference held last month inWashington, DC.andP;  The new AP system is still at least half a year away fromdelivery, so we will have to revisit it to examine how well it performs inlive production and how well it stacks up against the competition.andP;  Here wewill focus on the overall features, including the Leaf Picture Desk softwrae,which we saw in greater detail last month.andM;AP picks Leaf as basic receiverandM;The Associated Press announced on January 26 that it is switching toelectronic darkrooms as its basic photo receivers in an effort to accelerateconversion among its 950 U.S.andP;  subscribers to PhotoStream, AP's digital wireservice.andP;  The decision, announced the week before the Digital PhotographyConference, marks the turning point for the use of digital photography innewspapers and, as such, its repercussions will be felt for years to come.andM;In the third quarter of this year, AP said, it will begin replacingLaserPhoto receivers with the AP Leaf Picture Desk, an electronic darkroomdeveloped by Leaf Systems of Natick, MA.andP;  In the U.S., AP will essentiallyprovide the picture desk free to all of its wire photo members, much as itdid with its LaserPhoto receivers.andP;  AP said it expects the conversionprocess, which will be done region-by-region, to take about two years tocomplete.andP;  AP will also market the Leaf Picture Desk to nonmembers,international subscribers and agencies worldwide, and it will offeradditional units as an option to its members in the U.S.andM;PhotoStream--the digital wire service.andP;  AP is nearly ready to begin offeringits new satellite-based digital wire photo service, PhotoStream.andP;  PhotoStreamwas announced in 1987, but it wasn't until late last year that AP begantesting it with several papers.andP;  The first testing was done in 1988 duringthe Seoul Olympics.andP;  It was used at the World Series and the Malta summit in1989, followed by the Super Bowl last January.andP;  AP expects it to beoperational this summer.andM;Unlike AP's current ground-based system (the LaserPhoto terrestrial wirephoto network), PhotoStream uses a satellite transmitter and all-digitaltechnology.andP;  The bandwidth and speed of the network cuts transmission time ofblack-and-white photos from 9 minutes to less than 1 minute and reduces thetime to transmit color images from 30 minutes to less than 3 minutes.andM;Though PhotoStream is brand-new, AP would like to migrate its entire customerbase onto the new service as quickly as possible to avoid having to servicethe two networks.andP;  Eventually, the land-based LaserPhoto service will bephased out altogether.andM;AP's original plans called for papers to upgrade to AP's new two-minuteLaserPhoto receiver.andP;  AP saw the benefit of the digital network and newreceiver as one of speed.andP;  But in the two years that it has been developingthe satellite net, AP's philosophy has changed.andP;  It now believes that papersneed to have an electronic darkroom in order to make the best use of newservices AP will be offering.andM;&quot;The price was right.&quot;andP;  The Leaf electronic darkroom was introduced at ANPAlast June (Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  19/20).andP;  The demo unit was an early prototype, butinterest was so keen that by November Leaf had received over $3 million inorders for the desk and 45 scanner before it had installed one unit in thefield.andP;  Meanwhile, AP, which had been developing its own PC-based darkroomfor several yers, recognized the opportunity of going with an inexpensive,nearly finished product.andP;  Last fall we reported from IFRA (Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  5,p. 30) that AP was about to sign an agreement with Leaf giving AP exclusiverights to market the Leaf electronic darkroom to the media market (i.e.,andO;newspapers, magazines, news agencies).andM;AP's original marketing plan was to sell the Leaf Picture Desk as an optionfor wire photo subscribers.andP;  But with the purchase of electronic picturedesks moving at a sluggish pace, despite a precipitous drop in their prices,AP decided to go ahead and make a picture desk the basic receiver, leavingthe purchase of the recorder an option each paper makes for itself.andP;  If acustomer declines on the Leaf Picture Desk offer, it will receive thetwo-minute LaerPhoto unit.andM;The decision to basically give away the Leaf Picture Desk will undoubtedlyspark a surge in digital photography at daily newspapers throughout theUnited States.andP;  Hall Buell, the picture editor at AP and the leader of theLeaf Picture Desk project, estimated that fewer than 5% of AP's 950subscribers have already bought electronic darkrooms of any type.andP;  He expectsthe large majority of the subscribers to accept the Leaf desk, which meansthe number of picture desks installed in the U.S.andP;  will jump 10 to 20 timesits current number in the next two years.andP;  In short, starting in the fall ofthis year, the number of daily papers experimenting with digital photographywill mushroom from a few dozen to literally hundreds.andM;Buell defended AP's choice of the Leaf Picture Desk as the one that offeredthe best price/performance ratio on the market.andP;  &quot;We looked at every systemon the market, including our own, and found this one to be the best unitavailable today.&quot;andP;  Built specifically for processing images, the Leaf PictureDesk offers impressive speed and has all of the functionality photo editorsneed, Buell said, commenting that &quot;We haven't found anything that people wantit to do that it doesn't.&quot;andP;  But the critical factor in deciding to installthem instead of LaserPhoto receivers was that &quot;the price was right,&quot;according to Buell.andP;  The complete picture desk is not that much moreexpensive for AP than the new wire receivers--a dramatic change from thepicture desks of a few years ago.andM;That price, last summer at ANPA, was quoted by Leaf as $10,000 each forediting station and file server--a fraction of the cost of most picturedesks, which often run to six figures.andP;  Although AP and Leaf decline todiscuss the terms of their OEM arrangement, AP will be getting a handsomeprice cut for its volume commitment.andP;  For the end user, the price ofadditional LeafDesk stations and servers has risen from $10,000 each to$25,000 each, reflecting the fact that AP will be providing the first one aspart of its subscription fee and will be providing after-sale support andservice for all units it installs.andM;In the long run, AP expects the return on its investment to come from thepurchase of options such as additional desks and servers, peripherals and newdigital information services.andM;Controversial choice.andP;  Newspaper management is welcoming the Leaf PictureDesk giveaway with open arms.andP;  But the Leaf desk is a controversial systemamong the end users.andP;  It is a proprietary, custom-built image processing unitthat bucks the trend toward off-the-shelf computer technology.andP;  Both desk andfile server use Intel processors, but the operating system is Leaf's, as isthe internal bus and 5 MB/sec.andP;  (40 megabit/sec.)andP;  Token Ring networkstructure.andP;  The speed of the unit is impressive--250 millisecond access timefor any color picture in the system--but the price for accepting a speciallydesigned machine is flexibility: AP customers will be &quot;locked&quot; into Leaf; noother third-party supplier offers compatible parts.andM;Although it will be possible to transmit images between the Leaf Picture Deskand other systems, AP and Leaf will be offering additional Leaf stations,running on a nonstandard Token Ring network, as the route to multiple photostations.andP;  There is a GPIB interface on the file server that can be used tosend files directly to a Macintosh, and the port also has a built-in bridgefor connneting to Vax, Sun or Apple Macintosh Ethernet networks.andP;  Leaf saysthat interfacing with other systems is integral to its strategy, but thatfact remains that it has built a nonstandard system.andM;This is a direct about-face from AP's recent internal picture-deskdevelopments, first with a Vax and more recently with a PC system.andP;  The PCdevelopment effort has now been shelved; the Vax system will continue,although its role will likely diminish.andM;The problem, according to several end users with whom we've talked, is thatthey would prefer to have the picture desk integrated with other photo andart stations.andP;  For example, the Macintoshes that many papers have alreadypurchased for receiving weather maps and for creating graphics would notreside on the same network.andP;  Although it is likely that the Leaf Picture Deskwill be seen as a production-oriented tool, as photographers become moreinvolved with the editorial process, and have more control over the art andphotos that make up a page, they will inevitably want the picture deskintegrated with other image processing and page layout tools.andP;  Such tools arelikely to be off-the-shelf Mac (or PC) software as specially built systems.andM;Right now, Leaf is providing a bridge between its own network and ethernetnets, with the ability to send out several types of files.andP;  What remainsunclear is whether this bridge will provide sufficient connectivity for usersconstructing their own systems or tying Leaf into systems they already have.andM;As a result, some of the users with whom we've talked have mixed feelings.andO;On the one hand, they welcome the prospect of getting an electronic darkroom.andO;On the other hand, they recognize that they might not have chosen the Leafone, had the choice been theirs to make.andP;  With AP supplying the paper with anelectronic darkroom, the management of most papers is likely to balk orbuying something else, just to satisfy end users' concerns.andP;  Thus, these endusers feel as though they're being forced to accept the Leaf system--asis--without their input.andM;The AP Leaf Picture Desk systemandM;The hardware of the Leaf Picture Desk, as we mentioned, is a computer builtspecifically for image processing.andP;  The basic configuration includes oneediting station, which includes a CPU (one Intel 376 processor; three Intel8752 processors), IBM-style keyboard, two-button mouse and 24-bit colordisplay.andP;  The 60-Hz noninterlaced monitor displays 640 X 480 pixels.andP;  Thereis local processing of images within the 3 MB of RAM of the editing station,but no storage within the station itself.andM;The file server has seven processors in its CPU: five Intel 8452s and twoIntel 376 chips, with 4 MB of RAM.andP;  The 350-MB hard disk that is standardstores about 400 compressed images--sufficient to store a day's worth oftransmissions, according to AP.andP;  Up to three additional disks may be attachedto a server, providing up to 1.4 GB of storage.andP;  Using the bridge toEthernet, pictures could be stored outside the Leaf domain on another system.andM;The ratio of file servers to editing stations is customer-specific.andP;  Theremust be at least one of each and not more than 16 of each.andP;  All file serversand editing stations are linked by a 5 MB/sec (40 megabit/sec) token ringnetwork.andP;  Each editing station and server has a built-in network connection.andM;Extensive I/O.andP;  The input and output options for the Leaf stations andservers are extensive, offering the customer a wide array of options.andO;Editing stations and file servers have different I/O possibilities.andP;  We'lldiscuss each in turn.andM;The editing station has four GPIB ports that right now are configured forinput only.andP;  The interface itself is standard, but for it to be used as anoutput port or to accept input from other devices would require additionalsoftware not available from Leaf.andP;  Input is accepted from the followingscanners: Leafscanner 1, Leafscanner 45, AP Leaf Compander, Sharp reflectivescanner and Howtek ScanMaster/35.andM;For output, a Centronics port has a driver for the Hewlett-Packard LaserJetII.andP;  PostScript must be sent out of the file server at this time.andM;The file server has one GPIB interface port that may be used for input oroutput directly to and from a Scitex workstation, Macintosh or IBM-compatiblePC.andP;  The Leaf Picture Desk does file conversions for sending out its picturesin Scitex Handshake, TIFF and EPSF formats through this interface.andM;The GPIB interface may be configured instead as a communications server,which is an Ethernet bridge to Vax, Sun or Macintosh Ethernet networks.andO;Because there is but one of these ports on a file server, connecting a LeafPicture Desk to two or more external computers requires two or more fileservers.andM;In addition to the GPIB interface, each file server has a port dedicated toECRM Autokon 1000 output; it may be configured on the controller board as aCentronics output port for PostScript instead, if the customer wants.andM;Lastly, there are four transmit/receive channels and one RS449 line.andP;  Thefour I/O channels may be configured, by the user using software, to serve asanalog transmitter, analog receiver or RS232 receiver/transmitter.andP;  The RS232line has accompanying software that supports two-way communication with aremote bureau.andM;The RS449 line is intended for use as a T1 satellite receiver dedicated toreceiving photos from PhotoStream.andM;The maximum configuration at this time is 16 editing stations, 16 receivingstations, 64 analog I/O ports, 16 digital I/O ports and storage of 6,400pictures.andM;Softwre takes shape.andP;  At ANPA, Leaf introduced its product, but it couldreally only talk about what its software would contain.andP;  At the DigitalPhotography show, the software was stable enough for AP to set up fourstations, and photographers were welcome to sit down and play with thesoftware.andM;Leaf's software wasn't finished last month (there were several items on themenu not yet implemented at all), but we were able to take it for a firsttest drive.andP;  Leaf claims that it is about a month away from finishing thefirst release.andP;  It is already installed at several beta sites, but they haveyet to receive a level of software sufficient for real production testing.andO;AP's cautious plan of waiting until the third quarter to begin commercialshipments should give Leaf ample time to finish, debug and test in the fieldits first version before AP begins installing them nationwide.andM;The Leaf Picture Desk has dedicated data lines for receiving incoming photos.andO;On the screen, the directory shows the file names as the photos are received.andO;The user may then choose to see low-resolution versions of the photos, insizes ranging from thumbnails (16-up) to full screen size (1 up).andP;  You canalso choose 2- ot 4-up views.andM;In the 1-up view, the user may apply to a range of global image processingfunctions--cropping, sizing, adjustments to contrast, brightness, shadows,midtones and highlights.andP;  A dodging and burning tool enables these functionsto be applied to portions of the image as well.andM;Toning control may be applied to color as well as black-and-white photos.andO;Color balancing may be applied as a global change.andM;Images may be rotated in 90-degree increments.andP;  When sizing an image, thesoftware will retain the aspect ratio of the cropped area.andM;All of the actions update the image on the screen as you make the change.andO;For example, in adjusting the overall brightness, the image is darkened andlightened on the screen as you make your adjustment; you don't have to stopand wait for the image to be repainted to see the effect of a change.andM;The interface is a vertical panel of on-screen function buttons down theright side of the screen.andP;  The panel changes according to the functionsavailable, depending on the action being taken.andP;  The functions are activatedby the mouse, but there is a nice macro facility for recording any sequenceof mouse or keyboard actions and assigning it to one of the 10 function keys.andO;The function key assignments may be grouped into sets, and different usersmay have their own macros.andM;In addition to the file's name, the system records the date and time of eachphoto and lets the users key in the caption, size and source of each picture.andO;Each picture may be given an identification (or slug); eventually AP hopes tosend the slug along with the file name, just as it does with its stories.andO;Any of these fields may be used to create selective photo directories.andM;The speed of the system is excellent.andP;  Because of the speed of its net andthe fact that it works with low-resolution view files on the screen.andP;  LeafPicture Desk displays the photos without delay.andP;  Even when switching from athumbnail directory to a full-screen image, the response time is remarkablyfast.andM;Managing the files.andP;  The first release of the product is geared towardconventional wire-photo processing, i.e., photos are received, routed,processed, output and killed.andP;  Aside from the facilities for seeing a groupof photos from the &quot;pile,&quot; there are no tools for managing a database ofpictures (different piles, for example), and, in fact, the storage capacityis insufficient for creating a database of reusable photos.andP;  As yet, thereare no archiving facilities, although Leaf says this is a high priority forfuture development.andM;Local peripheralsandM;AP is offering several scanning and transmission options for the Leaf PictureDesk.andP;  The two-minute AP Dataphoto receiver is the only output unit AP isoffering at this time.andM;The scanning connection--Leafscanner 45.andP;  In addition to processing incomingwire photos, the Leaf Picture Desk will process photos scanned on theLeafscanner 45, a $20,000 option.andM;We covered the Leaf scanner at its introduction last summer at ANPA (Vol.andO;18, No.andP;  19/20).andP;  It is a high-resolution color scanner that accepts 35mmcolor or black-and-white slides and transparencies as large as 4&quot; X 5&quot;.andP;  Theunit is based on a linear array of 6,000 CCDS, with three filters for makingsuccessive passes over the image.andP;  The speed, Leaf estimates, is about 1minute per separation.andP;  A complete color scan, including setting up theoriginal, previewing to adjust the settings and making the actual scan, takesabout 5-6 minutes.andM;The Leafscanner 45 is the first relatively inexpensive scanner to handle both35mm and transparencies.andP;  The only competing product on the market is the newArray Technology scanner (also $20,000), which uses different technology butoffers similar quality and may be used to digitize three-dimensional objectsas well as slides and transparencies.andM;The importance of the Leafscanner 45 is that it opens the door to digitizinglocal photos.andP;  Most papers already doing color have invested in a drumscanner.andP;  But those new to digital photography, black-and-white or color,will need some sort of device for local images.andP;  The Leafscanner 45 provideshigh enough resolution to do color, but it is still much less expensive thana drum scanner.andM;Leafscan 1.andP;  AP is also offering the original Leaf scanner, Leafscan 1, whichis a 600-dpi flatbed color scanner.andP;  It scans reflective color orblack-and-white images up to 11&quot;x17&quot; in a single pass.andP;  Its price is $8,900.andM;Output.andP;  We discussed the extensive I/O facilities above.andP;  These are combinedwith drivers that Leaf has written specifically for certain interfaces.andP;  Atthis time, the hardcopy options are as follows:andM;* Autokon 1000--The ECRM Autokon camera is driven at the speed that ithalftones and images photos.andP;  This port may be configured instead as aCentronics interface for direct output of PostScript files.andM;* HP LaserJet II--The 300-dpi laser printer is driven from the Centronicsport of an editing station.andM;* Ethernet bridge--Hyphen used the bridge to connect the Leaf server to a Macat the Digital Photography show.andP;  The files were sent out in TIFF; in theMac, the files were converted to PostScript (which could also have been donein Leaf).andP;  The PostScript files were then rasterized by Hyphen for anUltreSetter at 1,200 dpi (see sample).andP;  Hyphen was not sure how, but itindicated that it intends to offer such a merging facility in the future sothat customers can combine the Leaf photos with full pages output inPostScript form.andM;* Kodak XL 7700--A continuous-tone color printer for making hard-copy prints,the Kodak printer may be driven through the GPIB port on the file server.andM;In the fieldandM;AP is also offering Leaf-based products for transmitting photos from thefield.andP;  These products are designed for sending photos taken by aconventional 35mm camera; as yet, AP has no provisions for still photography.andM;AP Leafax 35.andP;  The first product, AP's Leafax 35, is a portable fax machinethat digitizes color and black-and-white 35mm negative film and transmitsnegatives or positives over ordinary phone lines to the paper's receiver.andM;The unit fits inside a briefcase-size case that weighs 26 pounds.andP;  It plugsinto a 110- or 220-volt AC outlet and includes dual RJ-11 telephoneconnectors that permit simultaneous talk and transmission calls.andM;The Leafax scanner digitizes at 2,000x3,000 pixels over the entire image, in8 or 12 bits of color, which is acceptable quality for many magazines andmore than adequate for newspapers.andM;The Leafax is slower than a conventional fax machine because of the higherresolution.andP;  It sends images over a 1,200-baud modem at three speeds--AP AM(144 rpm), UPI AM/FM (120 rpm) and CCITT AM/FM (60 and 120 rpm).andP;  Using theAP format, this translates to about 9 minutes per image.andP;  (Color photos aresent as three files, one each for cyan, yellow and magenta, taking 27 minutesfor the entire color image.)andM;A GBIP digital interface is standard, just in case the photographer happensto be near a digital receiver.andM;In addition to its fax hardware, the Leafax offers a built-in 3.5&quot; colordisplay, 84-key PC-style keyboard and speaker for monitoring the phone line.andO;The display is used for viewing the effects of the software functions:zooming; cropping; adjusting brightness, contrast, shadows, midtones andhighlights; balancing color; and burning and dodging.andP;  The keyboard is usedfor entering captions.andP;  Each photo caption may be up to 600 characters long.andM;AP has been selling the Leafax 35 for about a year and half.andP;  The price is$15,000.andM;AP Leaf Compander.andP;  A new product, just introduced at Digital Photography'90, the AP Leaf Compander is a $7,500 option for the Leafax 35.andP;  The insidesof the Compander are much like a 7-lb.andP;  laptop PC--an 80286 processor, 640Kof RAM and a 20-MB hard disk, with a built-in Trailblazer 19.2 kilobaudmodem.andP;  However, the machine is a dedicated device with Leaf's datacompression software for sending images scanned by the Leafax 35.andM;Because it is meant as a companion to the Leafax, it does not have a keyboardor display, although there is a 16-key keypad and a one-line LCD display forcontrolling the unit and manually dialing.andP;  The unit may be programmed todial automatically as well.andM;Because it is a digital device, the Compander requires a digital receiver atthe other end, whereas the Leafax does not.andM;The AP Leaf Compander was tested at Malta and the Super Bowl in conjunctionwith PhotoStream.andP;  AP planned to test it again from the drug summit inColombia.andP;  The critical advantage of the Compander is speed--papers get morephotos of key events before deadline, which is a return for which many papersare willing to invest.andP;  But because it uses a high-speed data line withautomatic error-detection, the Compander is also ideal in areas where phonelines are poor.andP;  Sending the file over a data line instead of a poortelephone one should result in better quality, as well as fastertransmission.andM;AP Leafspooler.andP;  Another companion unit for the Leafax, the AP Leafspooler isa portable disk for storing up to 30 images from the Leafax.andP;  Images aretransferred in and out of the Leafspooler through a GPIB direct interface or,if it were at the home paper, for example, through its auto-answer modem.andP;  APLeafspooler costs $4,000.andM;Other AP systemsandM;AP has been developing its own Vax-based electronic darkroom for severalyears.andP;  The system is now a commercial product, with a basic unit priced alittle under $50,000.andP;  We have covered it from previous IFRA and ANPA shows(Vol.andP;  18, Nos.andP;  6 and 19/20) and so won't go over it in detail here.andP;  APwill continue to offer its Vax-based system to customers who want it, but itwon't be free.andP;  AP says that some customers, who already run DEC systems,would prefer to buy the Vax system, simply because it will be easier for themto maintain.andM;At this point, there is no plan by AP or Leaf to integrate the two systems,beyond the Ethernet bridge discussed above.andM;PC system is dead.andP;  As we mentioned last fall, AP's decision to market theLeaf Picture Desk left AP's still unfinished PC-based system a discardedproject.andP;  Its functionality and price would have made it a direct competitorto the Leaf system; in speed it would most likely have been slower.andM;What AP needs to do in the meantime.andP;  An electronic picture desk providesunprecedented control for users who currently process their wire photos ashard copy.andP;  But using the digital desk points out quickly a shortcoming ofthe wire service itself--no information other than the photo and its name istransmitted in digital form at this time.andP;  This means that the paper mustassign someone the full-time task of keying in information about the incomingphotos--the caption, author, photographer, location, etc.andM;AP could greatly facilitate the use of its own wire service by sending thistext as a digital ASCII file that accompanies each photo.andP;  That way, thepicture desk operator could focus on tasks such as sorting and routing,rather than repeating work already done by someone at AP.andM;AP said it plans to make such an improvement as part of its PhotoStream/Leafproject.andP;  It claimed that ANPA is developing a standard digital header forphotos, although a spokesperson at ANPA denied that assertion.andM;The lack of digital text is a shortcoming that applies to other wire servicesas well.andP;  It would certainly be beneficial for ANPA to develop one standardheader that all wire services use, but we hope that AP does not cite the lackof an ANPA standard as an excuse for putting off the implementation of one inthe meantime.andM;Competition in electronic darkroomsandM;Before its decision to install the Leaf desks, AP was a weak player in theelectronic darkroom market.andP;  The history of delays with its PC-based systemand digital picture network rubbed off on potential customers, many of whomput off a purchasing decision while they waited to see what products lookedmature.andP;  AP's Vax-based product, although more stable than the PC one, wasnot nearly as exciting: it appealed to conservative papers running on DEChardware.andP;  In the Leaf Picture Desk, AP finally had a hot product, butAnaya's Mac-based picture desk had even more flash appeal, and vendors likeCrosfield, AFP and Monotype had proven products.andP;  Had AP not decided as itdid, it might have gotten significant market share in the U.S., but quitepossibly it might not have been the leading supplier.andM;Now the situation is much different.andP;  Once its installations are in place, APis almost certain to have the largest installed base of electronic darkroomsin the U.S.andP;  Those that have the best chance of competing with AP are thosefrom UPI, Crosfield, Reuters and Anaya (being sold by the Computer Group).andO;To a much lesser extent, the units from Levien, Burkel, Sinclair and AFP alsocompete.andM;In Europe, where AP plays a less prominent role, and it will not be supplyingthe picture desks as part of subscribing, AP will be on more or less equalfooting with Tecnavia, AFP, Hasselblad, Sinclair, Crosfield and Reuters, toname a few of the more prominent suppliers.andM;Europe has a larger installed base of picture desks, but the large majorityare used by agencies to retransmit photos.andP;  Few papers in Europe currentlyhave electronic darkrooms themselves.andM;The domino effect.andP;  Already, AP's decision has prompted UPI to claim that it,too, will install electronic darkrooms at U.S.andP;  newspapers as part of its newsatellite-based photo network.andP;  UPI had not announced a decision as to whichdarkroom it would use when we went to press, but it is expected to make adecision quite soon.andP;  UPI spokesperson Milt Capps said UPI fully expects tobegin installing the picture desks &quot;within two to six months.&quot;andM;The upshot--wheels in motionandM;AP's decision to make the Leaf Picture Desk its basic wire photo receiver isa landmark event in the newspaper industry, one that is sure to spark theadoption of digital photo processing in the U.S.andP;  Without question, it is abold marketing move, one that has its competitors extremely nervous.andP;  UPI hasalready responded; other wire services may be pressured to follow suit in theU.S.andP;  In Europe, there is no dominant supplier of wire services or electronicdarkrooms, making it difficult to gauge what effect AP's decision will haveoutside the U.S.andM;But the adoption of digital technology for photo processing will not comewithout a price.andP;  First, papers will have to subscribe to AP's satellitenetwork--an extra $15-$80 a week, plus or minus some additional options.andO;That cost, AP says, should be more than offset by the savings in processingmaterials and other fees and equipment that will be phased out as papers godigital.andP;  AP is betting that virtually all of its subscribers will be willingto upgrade to the digital darkroom, both for the immediate returns ofhigher-quality photos that arrive sooner and for the long-term benefit ofkeeping up with the inexorable pace of technology.andM;Another cost is the lack of integration between the Leaf darkroom and othersystems.andP;  We've written about how AP was going with the fourth wave andlistening to its users with its darkroom products.andP;  Its decision to bundlethe Leaf Picture Desk with its wire photo service seems a step in theopposite direction.andP;  The price/performance of the Leaf Picture Desk certainlymake it attractive now, but it is uncertain how it will integrate with othersystems in the long run.andP;  It may be a year or more until we can assess whatthe cost of such integration (or lack of it) might be.andM;More important, though, will be the price of change within the organizationof papers as they adopt the new technology.andP;  Just as the adoption ofcomputerized editorial systems wreaked havoc on composition departments, theadoption of electronic picture desks will cause repercussions throughout thepaper's art, composition and editorial departments.andP;  Once papers begin toprocess their photos by computer, the challenge will not be how to make thetechnology work, but how to get people to work together with the newtechnology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
