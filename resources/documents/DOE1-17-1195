Major stratigraphic features are discussed and more detaileddescription is given using outcrops at the Grassi Lakes section nearCanmore. The exposed strata of this area, entirely Late Devonian, isnear the northern margin of the regionally extensive carbonate buildupknown as the Fairhome Complex, and contains a number of interesting reefdeposits in members of the Cairn and Southesk Formations. 3 refs., 14figs.</TEXT></DOC>
