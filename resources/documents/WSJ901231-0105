Customers withaccounts larger than that usually receive at least partpayment on the balance as the FDIC sells off the bank'sassets. The FDIC said it would make immediate advancepayments of 45% of the uninsured deposits. Depositors couldget additional payments on uninsured amounts later.   The bank, which was closed on Friday, had 28,000depositors with deposits of $438.1 million. These amountsinclude $25 million held by 300 depositors with accounts ofmore than $100,000.   Bank liquidations and depositor losses are relativelyrare. In 1990, the FDIC closed 168 banks, and the accountswere fully protected in 148 of those banks.</TEXT></DOC>
