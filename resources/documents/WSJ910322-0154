A growing number of economists and analysts thinkso.   Among them is Susan C. Lakatos, an economist at Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. In a recent analysis of U.S. manufacturing andits profit performance in this recession, Ms. Lakatosconcluded that the much-maligned sector is indeed &quot;leaner andmeaner.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   U.S. manufacturing has always taken it on the chin duringdownturns while the service sector galloped along. But sincethe early 1980s, when industries such as steel operated atless than 50% of capacity, manufacturers have taken big stepsto bolster cash flow and promote efficiency. Now, they arereaping the benefits.   &quot;Manufacturing has done a far better job of cutting costsin response to the economic slowdown than the service sectorhas,&quot; Ms. Lakatos says. And she asserts that U.S.manufacturers face an &quot;unprecedented opportunity to makemoney if volume picks up.&quot;   Adds Joseph J. McAlinden, a portfolio strategist atDillon, Read andamp; Co.: &quot;Profit increases for manufacturingcompanies could be much stronger than generally anticipatedover the next year.&quot; He predicts an overall profit gain forthe sector of as much as 15% by early next year. For thisreason, he recommends that basic industrial stocks make up17% of a portfolio, the single largest group.   Analysts like manufacturing's profit potential more nowbecause it has gotten better control of its costs.Specifically, their leaner condition reflects low inventoriesand labor costs. In the past year, labor costs in U.S.manufacturing have risen just 1%; the increase innon-manufacturing has been 5.3%, according to data from theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Non-manufacturing productivity, meanwhile, has fallen 1%while it has risen 2.7% for manufacturing. Not surprisingly,lower labor costs and better productivity means that profitmargins haven't contracted in manufacturing as sharply as inpast recessions despite slack demand.   In fact, Ms. Lakatos' research suggests that, for thefirst time in U.S. manufacturing history, product pricing hasoutpaced labor cost increases. Last year's fourth quarter,she says, &quot;was the first recession quarter ever that thespread {between product prices and labor costs} was stillpositive.&quot;   Of course, manufacturing isn't without its troubles. TheBig Three auto makers have slashed payrolls and spending toconserve cash. Auto suppliers also are getting hammered. Justlast week, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., which previously hadchopped its dividend 78% to 10 cents, said it would dismiss1,100 office workers; and PPG Industries Inc., which suppliespaint and glass to Detroit, said it expects first-quarter netincome to tumble 50%.   Likewise, International Business Machines Corp. this weekpredicted its earnings may be 50% lower than a year ago. Andjust yesterday, Reynolds Metals Co. Chairman William O.Bourke told analysts in Boston he expects the aluminumcompany's first-quarter results to be a &quot;disappointment.&quot;   But amid the rubble are quite a few success stories.Analysts think that although this quarter may provide manyearnings disappointments in manufacturing, the worst is over.Reynolds Metals suggested as much, predicting a &quot;significant&quot;earnings rebound in the second half as the economy recovers.   And even many companies now struggling have positionedthemselves for a quicker rebound because their actions wereso swift at the first sign of recession. Consider the autoindustry. In past recessions, auto makers didn't throttleback production until recessions were well under way. Thenthe excess inventories took months to work off.   This time, however, the industry took pre-emptive actionshortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August. Auto output isnow 34% lower than the level last September. Production is solean, says auto consultant William Pochiluk, &quot;we think therecould be some good news in May and June. They've cut backharder on production than sales have declined.&quot;   Similar cutbacks elsewhere in manufacturing signal aquicker recovery when demand returns. Economists say thatmanufacturers have been unusually viligant in theirmanagement of inventory in this recession.   &quot;Every month we're in right now is historic lows in dealerinventories,&quot; says James Ziemer, chief financial officer ofHarley-Davidson Inc., the Milwaukee motorcycle manufacturerthat had record sales and earnings last year. The executive,who says current dealer stocks are 30% lower than a year ago,calls the inventory &quot;too tight.&quot; The company intends toexpand production 10% by summer to get more motorcycles toits dealers.   Tight inventories also tend to prop up prices.Manufacturers haven't had to cave in. Their customers,running with less inventory, often can't wait for a betterprice. And the dollar, despite a recent run-up, is still atrelatively low levels, which means that foreign concernshaven't been able to cut their U.S. prices. Overall, Ms.Lakatos' study found that prices of manufactured goods wereup 5% in the 1990 fourth quarter from a year earlier.   Meanwhile, the prices of many commodities, including somemetals, have held relatively firm, with steel being thenotable exception. Aluminum prices, for instance, have beensupported by tight supplies. If there were 10% more metal ininventory world-wide, the price of primary aluminum ingotwould be 10 cents lower a pound than the current 70 cents,estimates Stewart Spector, an independent aluminum analyst.   Because aluminum supplies are tight, &quot;when consumer demandcomes back, there could be a fairly quick response in ourindustry,&quot; says Paul O'Neill, chief executive of Aluminum Co.of America. Alcoa earned $570 million before special chargeslast year, or more than three times its 1983 income, whenaluminum ingot prices equaled last year's. The world's No. 1aluminum maker has benefited from nearly $7 billion incapital spending since 1983 as well as debt reduction and avariety of programs to encourage employee involvement.   &quot;The manufacturing community is in reasonably good shapegiven this stage of a recession,&quot; Mr. O'Neill says. &quot;If itdoesn't get any worse, then this will have been one of ourmilder recessions.&quot;   Unlike the 1981-82 recession, this time metals companiesare among the most resilient. Consider Phelps Dodge Corp.,the copper producer that as recently as 1984 was losing $5million a week. The company took severe steps to rightitself: It slashed more than half of its work force andclosed some mines and smelters for as long as 13 months towork off surplus inventory. The company also endured a bitterand violent strike to oust the United Steelworkers union andget a leaner labor contract.   Today, Phelps Dodge has been resurrected. Employeeproductivity has tripled and net income last year was arecord $456 million. Although this year will be &quot;somewhatsofter than last, we're definitely not looking at anydisaster,&quot; says Chief Executive Douglas C. Yearley. He stillexpects &quot;significant profits&quot; this year.   Even the steel industry, which almost faced extinction inthe early 1980s, has changed its profile. While most if notall steelmakers probably will lose money in the firstquarter, UBS Securities analyst Charles Bradford calls theexpected deficits a &quot;short-term aberration.&quot; He predictsprofits in subsequent quarters, including a &quot;majorbounce-back in the second half.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
