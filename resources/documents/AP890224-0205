Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said thedropping numbers indicate the program is succeeding in discouraging``frivolous'' applications. The agency maintains that mostasylum-seekers are here for economic reasons, and are not fleeingpersecution, a requirement for obtaining refugee status.   Twenty-six asylum examiners will be sent home by Monday, saidAlfonso De Leon, the INS assistant district director forexaminations.   One of the two State Department personnel on hand to issueadvisory opinions returned home Thursday, De Leon added.   ``They are subject to recall, but it's just not cost-effective tohave them here with the numbers that are showing up, or should I saynot showing up,'' said De Leon, who oversees the adjudicationprocess.   A total of 50 examiners have been on duty here since Tuesdayunder a new policy in which asylum-seekers face immediate jailing,detention and deportation proceedings if their cases are denied.   More of the 24 case examiners remaining after Monday and part ofthe clerical staff also may be sent back home if the number ofapplicants remains extremely low, De Leon said.   The INS reported it processed 233 asylum applications Tuesday,the first day of the get-tough procedure. Only two people weregranted asylum that day.   Of 51 applications submitted Wednesday, none was approved. Thenumber of applicants dropped to 10 Thursday, all of whom wererejected and detained.   Of the 19 processed Friday, a 20-year-old Nicaraguan student wasthe only one granted asylum.   ``I understand he is active in a political party and had been inprison for his political beliefs,'' said INS spokeswoman VirginiaKice.   Single adults face detention here at the INS' minimum-securityPort Isabel Service Processing Center. Family groups are sent to anAmerican Red Cross shelter in Brownsville, where they must reportfor daily INS roll calls or face deportation proceedings in absentia.   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson said Monday the program was designedto discourage the tens of thousands of Central Americans pouringacross the Rio Grande illegally in southern Texas over the past year.   More than 40,000 have applied for asylum in the area since lastMay, when the INS noted a dramatic upsurge in immigration from thatregion.   Until recently, the INS was seeing 2,000 or more Central Americanasylum applicants weekly at its Harlingen District at the southerntip of the state.   Immigration advocates opposed to the new program said theimmigrants simply have gone underground, and will take their chancesof apprehension by the Border Patrol. Those apprehended may pursueasylum in immigration courts.   De Leon said it was too early to declare the new program asuccess, but added, ``I have received reports ... that the word isout throughout Central America and even groups in the pipeline haveturned around and gone back.''</TEXT></DOC>
