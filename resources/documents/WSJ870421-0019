And this year, lawmakers -- over Mr. Reagan's veto -- approved a clean-water bill that creates new government authority to curb the dumping of toxic chemicals.    In the twilight of a Reagan presidency that vastly expanded the deregulation begun by his predecessors, ardent decontrol is fading. Congress and even some agencies are renewing government activism on a broad range of issues -- especially those involving safety, the environment and consumer protection.    In areas where the public believes that deregulation went too far, &quot;the pendulum is starting to swing back,&quot; says Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a Tennessee Democrat. Helping push it is what several pollsters say is an emerging anti-business mood fueled by such events as the Wall Street scandals.    The reregulation push ranges from efforts to improve airline safety and cut delays to stiffer action against stock-trading abuses and proposals to curb credit-card interest rates. The move is bipartisan, but Democrats hope to make the need for selected regulation an issue in next year's presidential campaign. The Democrats, using their control of Congress, see regulation as a way to be activists on popular issues without spending a lot of money at a time of huge federal budget deficits.    The change reflects reviving public sentiment for a strong government role in certain areas of concern. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, for example, 61% of those surveyed said there should be more government regulation of the environment, while only 6% said there should be less.    The current public atmosphere leads William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, to conclude: &quot;The anti-government revolt of the 1970s is over.&quot;    That doesn't mean a return to the pervasive federal involvement of past years or an end to most economic decontrol. In areas where there is little public pressure, such as telephone service, deregulation is steaming ahead; like Humpty Dumpty, Ma Bell won't be put back together again. &quot;These are eggs that can't be unscrambled,&quot; says Missouri Sen. John Danforth, the ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee. Economic reregulation, he adds, &quot;is a dead issue.&quot;    Moreover, some areas are buffeted by cross currents. The Federal Communications Commission, for instance, has steadily reduced government involvement in broadcasting, but last week it warned it will crack down on &quot;indecent&quot; programming. And in flying, despite demands for federal action against service problems, few want to do away with the leeway that has led to cheap air fares.    The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 38% of the people still believe there is too much government regulation of the economy, while 32% think there is about the right amount and 23% say there isn't enough. But those results represent a major swing toward regulation from polls taken in 1980, when more than two-thirds believed Washington was overregulating business and damaging the free market.    The moves to reregulate clearly reflect selected responses to public demands. &quot;Some clear, early-stage patterns suggest that partial reregulation will occur to make up for problems that have developed,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a political analyst and columnist.    The turnaround shows up in a variety of areas, with impetus from the new Democratic control of Congress:    --Congressional Democrats are pushing for stronger worker-safety rules. Under Labor Secretary William Brock, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, already has begun reversing a previous easing of enforcement by imposing big fines against such corporate giants as Union Carbide Corp. and Chrysler Corp. for alleged failure to report industrial accidents properly. Union Carbide's case is on appeal, and Chrysler paid a fine without admitting to the charges.    --Congress, angered by Wall Street scandals, is moving ahead on a variety of legislation to curb insider trading and corporate takeovers. And, in a turnabout, the Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking a big increase in its budget.    --Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole is speeding up by four years a requirement that small planes operating at 14 busy airports have altitude-reporting equipment to reduce the chances of deadly collisions with airliners.    --The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is working on a major new rule that would require auto makers to meet a beefed-up passenger protection standard in side crashes. In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 43% of the public supported more regulation of auto safety, 41% wanted about the same amount and only 13% called for less regulation.    Democratic presidential contenders hope to capitalize on the renewed demands for more government protection. What the Democrats &quot;want to be identified with is the public interest,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, the president of the Center for National Policy, a Washington think tank. That means, he says, &quot;the safety of the air traveler, the small investor, the little guy who contends with the big institutions.&quot;    The Democrats, though, are careful not to push regulation too much for fear of being branded in 1988, as they were in 1984, as the party of big government. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, one Democratic hopeful, is pushing action to deal with pollution from ground water, an issue that may not seem sexy but that is of prime concern in Iowa, the site of the first presidential caucus. But when he does so, he urges a strong state role.    Transportation safety is perhaps the biggest focus of regulation as the result of worries about midair collisions and the Amtrak-Conrail train crash that killed 16 people early this year. With the Transportation Department's blessing, the Senate Commerce Committee has approved a drug-test bill proposed by Sen. Danforth and the new committee chairman, Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. It would require random testing of about three million people, including airline pilots, train engineers, and other private and government transportation employees.    The legislation, which sailed through the committee two months after the train crash, partly reflected outrage over the accident; government tests have raised suspicions of drug use by the Conrail engineer and brakeman. Stiffer requirements for rail-safety equipment are expected, too.    The trucking industry faces more-stringent safety rules amid rising concerns that partial deregulation of the industry in 1980 created pressures that may have led to unsafe practices. Both the department and some lawmakers are considering, for example, eliminating an exemption that permits many big trucks operating solely within certain communities to escape federal safety standards.    Public and congressional frustration over airline flight delays and service, created in part by the frantic mergers since decontrol, is promoting a host of proposed laws and rules. Flight delays last year increased to 417,644 from 333,817 in 1985. While they have declined a bit this year, Congress is expected to pass a bill requiring that passengers be given a record of an airline's on-time performance. And some in Congress may push to expand air-traffic limits to more busy airports.    Many lawmakers are angrily demanding action because they, too, have suffered air-travel problems. &quot;It's time to skewer the airlines,&quot; says Republican Rep. Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania. Such talk has airline, railroad and some trucking officials so worried that they have formed a coalition, dubbed the Transportation Reform Alliance, to promote continued deregulation. It will announce its goals tomorrow.    Complaints about three-week holds on checks and credit-card interest rates as high as 21% are prodding Congress to impose rules here, too. Actions taken so far &quot;would have been unimaginable last year,&quot; says Alan Fox, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of America. It is another example of the cross currents flowing, because pressure also is growing to let banks expand into some currently prohibited businesses.    The House is to vote today on legislation limiting how long a bank may hold a check before making the money available for withdrawal. Lawmakers also are likely to approve a bill requiring disclosure of credit-card terms before a person applies for the card. There also are proposals to cap interest rates on credit cards, but these are considered less likely to pass.    Some changes reflect the switches to Democratic chairmen in the Senate. Last year, consumer groups got nowhere pushing for the repeal of the insurance industry's exemption from federal antitrust laws. But this year, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, the new Democratic chairman of an antitrust subcommittee, already has held hearings on such a measure, which supporters contend could save consumers millions of dollars annually.    Some Democrats are even considering trying to curb the regulatory arm of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which, under Mr. Reagan, has become a powerful gatekeeper for proposed agency rules. Sen. Gore calls the office a &quot;regulatory black hole&quot; that hampers agencies in carrying out congressional directives. Supporters say the budget-office review has saved business millions of dollars in unnecessary rules.    Reaganites argue that many regulatory cutbacks are continuing. The Federal Trade Commission still takes few actions on consumer protection, while the Justice and Transportation departments continue to approve almost all merger applications that come their way. The SEC, while getting tougher on Wall Street, still leans toward deregulating certain international transactions, such as by letting some foreign companies sell bonds in the U.S. without meeting agency standards.    Even amid airline complaints, there is virtually no support for re-creating the Civil Aeronautics Board, which regulated airlines' routes and rates. The reason is simple: money. The Brookings Institution estimates that since airline deregulation occurred in 1978, it has saved consumers $6 billion a year.    And many passengers are willing to put up with some inconvenience to keep fares low: When asked in the recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll whether lower fares or fewer delays and cancellations were more important, 55% of the people cited lower fares; 36% said fewer delays and cancellations, and 9% weren't sure.    In the environmental area, however, Congress is responding to public pressure for a crackdown on polluters. The Clean Water Act, for example, requires the progressive tightening of water-pollution controls where toxic &quot;hot spots&quot; persist despite existing rules. The legislation also finances new state programs to protect runoff water from pesticides and solvents.    The law illustrates how far the federal government has come since 1983, when Anne Burford, then the EPA chief, was pushing to ease water-treatment standards to reduce industry's burdens. And it comes on the heels of a flurry of other laws compelling the administration to toughen regulation of hazardous wastes, drinking-water pollution and asbestos.    &quot;In general, the public and the Congress have seen fit to support more economic regulation in the area of environmental controls,&quot; says Leon Billings, an environmental consultant. The Reagan administration is applying the new laws grudgingly, he says, but in the next administration, &quot;I expect to see a real revival of tough legislation.&quot;    ---   'Do you think there should be more government regulation of automobile safety than there is now, less, or about the same amount?'
