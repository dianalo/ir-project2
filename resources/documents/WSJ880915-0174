The Colonists' persistent use of this coin resulted in Queen Anne's Proclamation of 1704 which made its use official by decreeing that henceforth her American Colonists were to use the silver Spanish dollar as their unit of account. So, by the time the Constitution was written, the dollar had become a known thing -- a silver coin recognized by everyone.    The Founding Fathers used the word &quot;dollar&quot; twice when writing the Constitution but they did not define it; they didn't have to because everybody knew what a dollar was -- a silver coin of known weight. It was Alexander Hamilton and his committee who defined the dollar by assaying specimens of the various dollars then circulating and determining the average silver content to be 371.25 grains pure. Hamilton reported his findings to Congress on Jan. 28, 1791, and they were incorporated into the Coinage Act of 1792, signed by President Washington on April 2.    In essence, what the Founders did was to accept an already existing coin and adopt it as the unit of account for the new nation they were creating after assigning it a more precise silver content.    These are historical facts; they can not be changed, not even by Congress. Congress can not say the word &quot;dollar&quot; in the Constitution has a different meaning today than in 1789 any more than they can say: &quot;Henceforth all pigs are horses.&quot;    Thus Edwin Vieira (letter to the editor, Aug. 22) is correct when he states that the dollar is a fixed unit that can be changed only by constitutional amendment.
