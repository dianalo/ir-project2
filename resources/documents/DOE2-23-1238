By the orderedsequence of Ig gene rearrangement it has now become clear that acutelymphoblastic leukemia and the lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenousleukemia are developmental stages of B cell precursors, and that theIg gene rearrangement pattern is unique to each tumor and serves as amarker to follow its course and to search for low levels of residualtumor after therapy. The author in his review, explains the DNA rearrangementof the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes that create specificmarkers capable of establishing the cellular lineage and stage of developmentof a lymphoid malignancy.</TEXT></DOC>
