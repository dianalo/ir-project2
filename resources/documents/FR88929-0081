Although the Privacy Act requires only that the ``routineuses'' portion of the system be published for comment, HCFA invites commentson all portions of this notice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>HCFA filed a new system report with the Speaker of theHouse, the President of the Senate, and the Acting Administrator, Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget(OMB) on September 26, 1988.

We plan tocreate a records system linking individual-level data from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) tumor registry system, operated bythe National Cancer Institute (NCI), with Medicare enrollment and claimsdata. This linked file will greatly enhance HCFA's and NCI's ability tounderstand and evaluate the amount and kinds of services received by Medicarebeneficiaries contracting cancer.The SEER program is a set of population based tumor registries funded byNCI with the goal of collecting information on every case of cancer diagnosedwithin the catchment areas covered by each tumor registry. The NCI hascontracts with local health oriented agencies to collect these data. CurrentlySEER data are available for about ten percent of the U.S. population, includingseveral entire States, several metropolitan areas, and several rural areas.The dataset contains information on each cancer case, such as anatomicsite of the primary cancer, histology, stage of the disease at diagnosis,date of diagnosis, and other items. In addition, demographic informationis also collected, such as residence down to the census tract level, age,race, and sex. The NCI reports on cancer incidence, mortality, and survivalevery year using SEER as the primary source of their data.Merging SEER data with HCFA data on cost and utilization of Medicare serviceson an individual level will make possible studies on treatment costs forMedicare cancer patients from time of diagnosis onward. The dataset canbe used to compare total medical costs of patients diagnosed with differentstages of cancer. The merged dataset will also provide descriptive dataon the costs of hospitalizations for cancer, controlling for site and stageof cancer, and by socio-demographic characteritics. Regional variationsin the costs of treating Medicare cancer patients can also be explored.The merged dataset could also be used to examine issues of access to care.Differences in treatment by age or race could be identified, controllingfor stage at diagnosis, as well as comorbid conditions. Differences insurvival could also be measured, controlling for comorbidities. Outcomesfor beneficiaries treated in different kinds of institutions (e.g. oncologycenters vs. community hospitals) could also be compared.The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 3552a, allows us to disclose information withoutthe consent of the individual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosurefor purposes which are compatible with the purpose for which we collectedthe data. The proposed routine uses in the new system meet the compatibilitycriteria since the SEER information is collected for the purpose of measuringthe incidence and prevalence of cancer nationally and evaluating outcomesin the form of survival. The merged dataset will further this work by refiningthe measurement and comparison of outcomes. Medicare data are collectedin part to evaluate the use of services by beneficiaries. The merged datasetwill enhance our understanding of access to and effectiveness of servicesreceived by beneficiaries suffering from cancer.We anticipate that disclosures under the routine uses will not result inany unwarranted adverse effects on personal privacy. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William L.

Theareas covered by the 11 registries are Iowa, Utah, Hawaii, New Mexico,Connecticut, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, San Francisco-Oakland, Atlanta, Detroit,and Seattle.AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:  Section 1875(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 139511(a)) and Sections301 and 410-416 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 and 281-285a-5).PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM:  To study the use of health care services by Medicare beneficiaries withcancer. Treatment costs by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, and comorbiditieswill be examined. The proposed system will be used for purposes of researchand statistics only.ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIESOF USERS AND THE PURPOSE OF SUCH USES:  Disclosure may be made:  (1) To a Congressional office from the records of an individual in responseto an inquiry from the Congressional office made at the request of thatindividual.
