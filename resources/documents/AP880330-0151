Court sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said warrantsfor the arrest of Chun Kyung-hwan and three of his aides andassociates were issued shortly after midnight.   The warrants were executed later Thursday.   Thursday's arrests brought to nine the number of suspects incustody in the scandal involving the semi-official Saemauldevelopment movement.   Earlier, five suspects, including two of Chun Kyung-hwan'sbrothers-in-law, were jailed Tuesday on charges of embezzlement andfraudulent land sales.   All nine are either Saemaul officials or former leading membersof the nationwide organization.   Prosecutors said the younger Chun, who led Saemaul between 1981and 1987, embezzled at least $9.3 million and built up a fortune inland, stocks and business interest.   Senior Prosecutor Kang Won-il, who has headed the investigation,said Wednesday the younger Chun would initially face six charges,including corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and violation oflaws governing special economic and financial crimes.   If convicted, Chun faces punishments ranging from 10 years inprison to the death sentence.   ``We have enough evidence to incriminate them,'' Kang said afterquestioning the four men for more than 36 hours.   Chun Doo-hwan, who has not been implicated in the scandal, is ona private tour of the United States. He met with President Reaganat the White House last week.   Opposition parties are demanding that he return to Seoulimmediately to explain his role in the scandal. Opposition leadershave charged that the former president was involved in the affair.   Saemaul, founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural development,evolved into a powerful organization involved in activities rangingfrom building model communities to promoting urban clean-upcampaigns.   Prosecutors say the younger Chun, who was appointed to head thegroup by President Chun in 1981, used his position to divertgovernment and private donations, sell influence and pressurebusinesses to make gifts of money, land and stocks.   He resigned as Saemaul chief in 1987 after being linked toorganized crime. He fled to Japan April 18 when news of thegovernment probe surfaced, but returned two days later to facequestioning.   During the inquiry, about 200 government officials and businessleaders have been questioned about corruption and a possiblecoverup to protect former President Chun and his family. None ofthem has been formally implicated.   However, prosecution sources said Wednesday night that morepeople might be charged.   The Chun administration has long been suspected of widespreadcorruption. But during its authoritarian administration, criticismof the president and his family were not tolerated and allegationsof corruption were routinely ignored.   President Roh Tae-woo, who took power Feb. 25, is thought tohave supported the Saemaul investigation to discredit the formerpresident and end his attempts to retain power and influence withinthe government.   Some Chun royalists were purged from the governing DemocraticJustice Party earlier this month, and Roh blocked the formerpresident's attempts to retain substantial power as a governmentadviser.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with militarybacking in 1980, promised during the presidential election campaignlast year to root out and end official corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
