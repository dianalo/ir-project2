 That's because,in the DOS world, all you can see on most screens is a series of characters.andO;And, if most people can't see a graphic while they are composing a document,they will have trouble figuring out how to use it in the final output.andP;  Inthe Macintosh and Windows worlds, most machines can only display a bar chartor simple graphic, but the percentage of reports produced using graphics ishigher because these environments do let the user look at graphics on screen.andO;But the main reason that people don't use graphics in their reports--even ifthey can see it--is that most people don't consider themselves graphicartists, and are unwilling to create their own graphics.andP;  The sources of freeor inexpensive clip art are still relatively sparse, and the truth of thematter is that most clip art isn't worth fighting for.andP;  So the users aren'treally motivated to search out and include graphic material in the documentsthey produce until they can get the best -- full-color, high-resolutiongraphics and photography.andM;So how do you get color stuff like that into your reports and publications?andO;Until now, most people have focused on color scanners (of which the Microtekand Sharp products seem to be preferred) -- relatively inexpensive devicesthat scan photographs or other color material and create uncompressed, 8-bit(256-color) images -- or slide scanners (of which the Howtek and Barneyscanproducts seem to be favored) -- not-so-inexpensive devices that scan 35mmslides and create either 8-or 24-bit (16-million-color) images.andP;  But theactual scanning process is not easy, since how you align the source materialin the scanner and the range of choices in controlling the devices anddetermining the output file format can have enormous effects on the resultsof the scan.andP;  As well, 24-bit images can produce gigantic files, one or twoof which can occupy an entire hard disk in a normal office.andP;  And scanningdoesn't merge well into a network environment, since it requires a humanbeing to operate the scanner and therefore must be done locally.andP;  Finally,the plain fact is that scanning requires physical and mental effort infinding, selecting, and creating the artwork, before you even get to thestage of composing a document or report.andP;  The net result is thatgraphics-oriented scanners have not become a major influence in personalcomputing.andM;Another proposed solution to this problem has been digital cameras, which arecameras that convert the analog light sources usually captured on film intodigital electronics right inside the camera itself (using technology similarto that used in scanners) and then store the image on a tiny magnetic disk,which takes the place of film and requires no processing other than printing.andO;Canon has been the leadership company in this area with its Xapshot productline.andP;  Digital cameras are actually a very sexy approach to solving thisproblem of creating usable source material for color computing -- the imagesare digital from the moment of creation; the system lets the user previewimages on his television screen before printing (or simply to store the disksand use the TVas a sort of virtual photo album); the camera and computingtechnologies are all of the same, digital types; and the technologies areimproving at a rapid pace, promising even better and cheaper products as timegoes by.andM;But digital cameras won't work.andP;  This is a dangerous statements to make,because digital cameras are exclusively being offered by Japanese companiesand Japanese companies have been known in the past to find a way to persuadecustomers to change their habits to adopt a new technology.andP;  But there areseveral underlying problems with digital photography: The first is thatdigital cameras are expensive.andP;  The basic Canon Xapshot camera is a fewhundred dollars, but produces images that are not acceptable for evenbusiness use.andP;  (Ironically, when it comes to photographs, consumers are muchmore demanding than business -- minimum expectation is the same quality as35mm prints or slides, which you can now get from $15 disposable cameras plus$20 in processing costs.)andP;  In order to get acceptable, photographic-qualityimages, you need cameras costing more than $2,000.andP;  In addition, the usergets no control over the digitizing of the image -- which is done by apreprogrammed, embedded processor in the camera -- and therefore no choiceabout the results of his work.andP;  (Some people would argue that choice, as Iobserved above, makes things much more complicated and harder to use, so thatthe digital cameras' lack of controls is actual an advantage.)andP;  Moreimportant, the cost of getting a paper print of the image that comes anywherenear what customers are used to -- namely 35mm prints or slides -- isprohibitive.andP;  Even the best of those prints produces something that isprinted on different, and not necessarily durable, kinds of paper compared tothe paper photographs are printed on today.andP;  The nail in the coffin for therelevance of digital photography to color computing is that, even though thecamera is based on computer technologies, it uses non-standard media and fileformats and therefore requires that the computer user buy a relativelyexpensive disk drive to read the 2-inch media and convert it to a readableform.andM;The solution to this problem of creating, storing and making lots of colormaterial accessible to a large number of users has actually only just beenannounced and, for those people touting digital technologies, has come out ofleft field because it is based on the existing, analog technology ofsilver-nitrate film.andP;  The solution is Kodak's new Photo CD system.andP;  In caseyou have missed the announcement, Photo CD is an end-to-end system thatduplicates all of the advantages of the digital cameras, including being ableto preview images on your television (although you need to buy a viewingdevice, which is not true with the digital camera), but continues to producenegatives and prints (or slides), produces output on a relatively standardcomputer media (CD-ROM), and gives the user many options for controlling thequality of output.andM;To explain, with Photo CD, you don't need to buy anything new to producepictures.andP;  Instead, what Kodak has come up with is a system forphoto-processing houses to scan and convert your photographs into digitalimages that it then stores on a CD-ROM and returns to you along with yourprints and negatives for an extra, but reasonable charge.andP;  (The packaging ofthe CD is cool, because the back of the package contains thumbnails of everyphoto on the disk, giving you a way to organize your photos for storage thatnegatives have never provided.)andP;  So you bring your film in just as you donow, but the processing envelope contains an extra option for producing a CD,which you check if you want one.andP;  When you pick up your film, it includes theCD.andM;If you are a consumer, only interested in archiving your images, you wouldneed to buy a Photo CD-compatible player and attach it to your television.andO;These players, which are not yet available, will be CD-audio and CD-graphicscompatible, so you will still be able to play your audio CDs.andP;  So the idealsituation is that you are planning to acquire or replace your audio CD playerand you say, what the heck, for an extra $150, I can also buy into the PhotoCD system...andP;  That's neat, although it's not entirely compelling.andM;But, if you are a computer user, particularly the user of a real colorcomputer as described later on in this issue, then the notion is compellingbecause a Photo CD is a CD-ROM that can be plunked into any standard CD-ROM.andO;And, as long as your software supports the Photo CD image format, it canbecome an instant resource for merging high-resolution, high quality colorphotographs -- photos that you've taken with any standard 35mm camera attrade shows, company meetings, retail stores, or at a company picnic -- intoyour documents.andP;  Bingo!andP;  The whole system works without requiring you tobecome a color scientist or take a chance on an unproven technology, and itwas all designed by the original photography company, Eastman Kodak.andP;  Nowstretch yourself and think about this system becoming popular.andP;  The CD evenbecomes a distribution format for photographic images both commercially andcorporately, so that you may not even have to take your own photographs --just use the disk that headquarters sent or that you bought from United ColorClipart Company for $59.95.andP;  (This part really belongs in the story aboutoutput, below, but I couldn't contain myself.)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
