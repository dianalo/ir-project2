The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it would provide apromissory note of $238 million and various other forms ofassistance worth an estimated $43 million to Downey Savings andLoan Association of Newport Beach, Calif.   Downey is taking over the insolvent Butterfield Savings and LoanAssociation of Santa Ana, Calif., and investing $40 million in thedeal, from which it is getting tax benefits.   Butterfield, with loans and other assets of $541 million anddeposits and other liabilities of $694 million, has been undergovernment-supervised management since August 1985.   It was one of several thrift institutions in California thatembarked in the early 1980s on programs of rapid growth, investingdeposits solicited through professional brokers intonon-traditional activities, including a chain of fast-foodrestaurants.   Butterfield's two offices, one in Santa Ana and the other inBakersfield, will remain open and all deposits will transfer withthe sale to Downey, which has $3.1 billion in assets and 42branches in California, the bank board said.   The bank board said it has closed or merged 116 institutions sofar this year. Sixty of those deals, requiring a governmentcommitment of nearly $14 billion, have come since mid-August.   Two of those transactions have involved large Californiainstitutions: Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo, whichrequired $565 million in government aid, and American Savings andLoan Association of Stockton, which is getting $2 billion in thelargest-ever rescue of a single thrift institution.   The latest rescue comes amid intense debate over whethertaxpayer money will be needed to bail out the savings industry.Congress' General Accounting Office says as much as $50 billionwill be required to clean up the mess, at least some of it fromtaxpayers.   On Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakisblamed the crisis on Reagan administration policies which permittedSandamp;Ls to move from traditional home mortgage lending to risky newareas. The campaign of Republican George Bush responded that theDemocratic Congress was to blame for cutting back an administrationplan to tap the industry, not the taxpayer, to bolster thegovernment fund insuring Sandamp;L deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
