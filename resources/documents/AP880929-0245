On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 3 centslower at $14.11 a barrel Wednesday after trading between $14.06 and$14.27 during the day.   Other contract months closed lower.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.58cent to settle at 46.17 cents a gallon, while other contract monthsclosed mixed.   October heating oil edged down 0.01 cent to 39.50 cents agallon, with other contract months declining.   API statistics released after the close of trading Tuesdayshowed that although gasoline inventories were up 2.2 millionbarrels on a weekly basis to 219 million barrels, they 10 millionbarrels below the same period a year earlier.   Heating oil stocks were up 3 million barrels from a yearearlier, while crude oil was down 4 million barrels to 319 millionbarrels, below the 337 million barrels of inventory last year,according to API.   Analysts said the lower crude statistics were consideredbullish, but the decline wasn't enough to offset concerns about theoversupply of oil on world markets that has depressed pricesrecently.   Wednesday's gains, they said, stemmed from the combination oflower gasoline stocks and API figures showing a drop in refineryruns, down 550,000 barrels a day to 12.79 million barrels.   ``When refinery runs go down then less gasoline will be comingout,'' said Stephen Smith, research analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Brokers said some seasonal slowdown in refinery runs is expectedat the end of the summer, but the current drop was larger thanusual.</TEXT></DOC>
