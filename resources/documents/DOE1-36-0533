The digitized film offers potentialdiagnostic advantages over the conventional film, because of the contrastmanipulation and many other processing options. The possibility to recoverthe information of overexposed films appears very attractive. The photostimulablephophors allow to get good quality images, with a consistent reductionof dose and costs. These plates offer the possibility, in the next future,to replace the conventional screen-film systems.</TEXT></DOC>
