Fossedal</HL><DATE>04/09/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   Democracy is transforming the globe, yet a curiousconsensus holds that the U.S. -- the oldest, richest andprototypically successful democracy -- is declining. PaulKennedy and the New York Review of Books brigade see apitiful giant awash in deficits and overcommitments. PatBuchanan and many National Review types doubt there can everbe a meaningful reform of communism, or even that democracyis a good thing. And those in the center, such as GeorgeBush, while certainly favoring the tide of freedom, see theU.S. role in its extension as that of a prep-schoolcheerleader: Hooray for Gorbachev and Deng, but don't expectus to do anything serious to influence them.   Joseph Nye's &quot;Bound to Lead&quot; (Basic Books, 307 pages,$19.95) is a potent tonic for this malaise: a briskcounterassertion that the U.S. is, and likely will remain,the most powerful country on Earth. With so many questioningwhether America even has substantial leverage, &quot;Bound toLead&quot; delivers a critical face-slap to the waning-empirehand-wringers.</LP><TEXT>   In the first five chapters, Mr. Nye coolly analyzes thehard numbers on the history of declining powers, the relativeposition of the U.S. today, and the standing of our likelyrivals: the Soviet Union, China, Japan and Europe. By manymacroeconomic measures, such as gross national product, orvarious indices of technical innovation, Mr. Nye notes, theU.S. has held its own and even advanced in the 1980s. Onlywhen compared with the years just after World War II does theU.S. register substantial reduction. And one could hardlyexpect or even want our unusual position in 1945 to remainfrozen.   The U.S. &quot;personal savings rate,&quot; he admits, has dropped-- but it is a hollow statistic that excludes many types ofinvestment in the future, such as spending for education or arise in stock prices. When these are factored in, &quot;U.S.capital formation comes to 30% of GNP,&quot; roughly the average(34%) of 10 other leading industrial countries. Likewise, thetrade deficits that hypnotize decline-mongerers reflect aninflux of foreign investment, most of it counted as&quot;imports,&quot; as well as a reduction in imprudent loans abroad,which showed up as 1970s &quot;exports.&quot;   But no sooner has Mr. Nye debunked some of these bogusaggregates than he, alas, picks up some of their baggage. Heharps on the U.S. budget deficit as a major problem; yet itis not huge compared with that of most countries. He pins theU.S. deficit, in turn, largely on tax-rate cuts that in factbrought in a gush of revenues, particularly from the wealthy.Mr. Nye seems to favor many of the high-tax, special-subsidyschemes that in the '70s really did cause U.S. decline.   A political scientist, Mr. Nye is especially cogent whenhe considers the subtle, indirect uses of power. He arguesthat the U.S. and other countries will have to relyincreasingly on &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;co-optive&quot; power: getting othercountries not so much to do things they don't want, butrather, actually to want the same things we do. In recentyears, he contends, military and covert action, and evenblatant economic coercion, have been rendered less usable forall powers by such forces as the nuclear threat, economicinterdependence, technology's diffusion, and the extension ofdemocratic forms and ideals.   In many ways, the U.S. is uniquely well-situated for thisnew world. Unlike Japan, we have a pluralistic society thatreadily absorbs immigrants, products, new ideas. Unlike theSoviets, we have a basically healthy polity, economy andideology that are envied, not loathed, by most of the world.   Mr. Nye's concluding discussion of options for U.S. policyseems, by contrast, flat and conventional. He seems reluctantto consider dismantling U.S. forces in Europe, though thiswould save about $100 billion a year in an age of resourcepressures. Nor do the final chapters have much to say aboutrebuilding Eastern Europe economically, or the fragiledemocracies of the Third World. Here we are, with severalbillion people balanced on the margin between freedom andslavery -- and Mr. Nye seems more focused on &quot;drug traffic,AIDS, global warming and other problems.&quot;   Indeed, while pleading for &quot;long-run thinking,&quot; &quot;Bound toLead&quot; provides little in the way of a central, animatingvision as to how all this U.S. influence ought to be used. Ifleaders are to execute the consistent diplomacy whose absenceMr. Nye and other intellectuals bemoan, and if voters are tosupport it, then intellectuals must do a better jobpropounding principles and standards.   Mr. Nye makes up for his weak summation, however, with hiswell-documented central message: If power is considered inits broad, ideopolitical manifestations, the U.S. enters the1990s as the world's greatest single player. No, we can'tabsolutely determine that, say, Poland or Brazil will emergeas stable democracies. But we will have much to say about it.In alerting us to this awesome responsibility, &quot;Bound toLead&quot; may help us to discharge it efficaciously.   ---   Mr. Fossedal is a research fellow at the HooverInstitution, Stanford University.</TEXT></DOC>
