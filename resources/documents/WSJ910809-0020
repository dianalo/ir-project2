Under Mr. Vasquez, it seemed that the judiciary had gainedindependence and that corruption -- at least in the highercourts -- had been stopped. But Guatemalans are learning thehard way that putting honest people in charge will not leadto the kind of institutional arrangement we want for ourcountry. Something is fundamentally wrong with our judicialsystem, and recent changes in the legislation, all the way upto the Constitution, are making things worse.</LP><TEXT>   It so happens that, in a certain way, Guatemala has becomethe victim of well-meaning foreign governments andhuman-rights organizations. In order to accommodate theirwishes (a precondition if Guatemala is to retain foreign-aidbenefits), laws were rewritten in a fashion that encouragescrime. Under the 1984 Constitution, the rights of thecriminals are, in practice, better defined and easier toenforce than the rights of law-abiding citizens.   Just one example: Article Six of the Constitution statesthat a person who is arrested must be either taken to courtwithin six hours or set free. Policemen who do not abide bythe six-hour rule are punished severely. Given the country'sdeplorable communications (from roads to telephones to policecars), it is virtually impossible to collect evidence andbuild a solid case in such a short time, especially incomplicated situations such as drug-related crimes. So, mostof those who are arrested -- even arrested &quot;in flagrantedelicto&quot; -- are released within six hours.   Not surprisingly, during the second half of the pastdecade, the U.S.-bound cocaine trail was gradually shiftedwestward away from the Caribbean islands to Guatemala. Looseenforcement of lenient laws makes Guatemala a very convenientstation between South American producers and North Americanconsumers.   According to Guatemalan military sources, every other daya fleet of small aircraft lands on one of the manyclandestine landing strips somewhere in the wilderness,beyond the reach of the country's primitive radar systems.Meanwhile, a steady flow of ground carriers travels acrossthe country, between the southeastern and the Mexicanborders. Officially, they carry all sorts of agriculturalproducts, manufactured goods and raw materials. On closerinspection, however, hidden compartments in the wheels andradiators, or conspicuous packages camouflaged withinotherwise harmless loads, often reveal illegal cargoes.   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and ourlocal counterpart, each week 1,000 kilograms of cocaine --worth $120 million or more on the U.S. market -- change handsin Guatemala. Landing, storage, refueling and reroutingfacilities, provided by half a dozen local organizations,have changed many social climbers into affluent swingers.   In a recent article, Guatemalan journalist CarolinaAlpirez discloses that use of a clandestine landing stripcosts $100,000 a landing, while storage costs $500 akilogram. She vaguely identifies a handful of well-organizedcocaine networks, scattered throughout the country, andestimates that each network collects about $1 million a weekfrom the cocaine cartels, tax-free of course.   All handling and shipping charges taken into account, thelocal markup on cocaine is probably close to 6% of retailvalue, which suggests a fairly competitive service marketalong the cocaine trail. In 1990 alone, some $400 million(15% of Guatemala's foreign debt or 20% of the country'sannual exports) were smuggled into the country along withcocaine, distorting the economy in peculiar althoughpredictable ways: Real-estate prices have rocketed, theCentral Bank has managed to stabilize the exchange rate, andfunny-looking guys have filed applications for theestablishment of new commercial banks.   Is there a link with the world-infamous Bank of Credit andCommerce International? Apparently yes, but, so far, it maybe that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg. TheGuatemalan government plans to sue BCCI in connection withcoffee deals and with the purchase of helicopters during theprevious administration. Given BCCI's reputation, it is hardto believe that its interests in Guatemala do not go beyondcoffee and helicopters.   On and off between 1986 and 1990, the names of severalgovernment officials and congressmen were linked tococaine-trail operations. Alas, Guatemalan courts and jailsare not intended for powerful individuals. The only exceptionso far is Arnoldo Vargas, the charismatic and wealthy mayorof Zacapa, who was re-elected last November but was put injail just two weeks before his inauguration for a secondfive-year term. But even Mr. Vargas, on whose property thepolice seized more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, willprobably be acquitted under Guatemalan law. His extraditionorders, filed through the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, willprobably be aborted too.   The irony of it all is that drug addiction is not a majorproblem in our society. Cocaine tempts a tiny elite ofwell-to-do -- typically sophisticated Guatemalanprofessionals trained in the U.S. If present-generation NorthAmericans crave the white powder, we certainly feel sorry forthem. But there is very little we can do about an alien fadwe really don't understand. And we resent having to bear theextremely painful backlash of a problem we did not helpcreate. After all, were it not for the billions of dollarsthey collect from North American addicts, the South Americancartels would not be so powerful.   Some dramatic but naive moves reported as victories inPresident Bush's war on drugs -- and before that in PresidentReagan's war on drugs -- do not seem to be working in theright direction. They increase the risk associated withcocaine traffic. They preclude marginal suppliers from thecocaine market. Thus, they concentrate yet more power --monopoly power -- in the hands of the mightier cocaineproducers and dealers.   Although I side with Milton Friedman in thedrug-legalization debate, I will not argue that druglegalization in the U.S. would do away with drug abuse. Itwould, however, confine the cocaine problem to the U.S.,without corrupting the rest of the Americas.   ---   Ms. Martinez-Mont, former dean of economics at FranciscoMarroquin University, writes from Guatemala City.</TEXT></DOC>
