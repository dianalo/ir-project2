Western diplomats also reported Thursday that communist forcesfired six missiles at Afghan guerrillas near the border.   The stepped-up activity in the 10-year-old Afghan war followsWednesday's capture by guerrillas of a key Afghan frontier post andthe introduction by Soviet forces of new long-range missiles.   Neither Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government or Pakistanacknowledged the other's claims of border air battles, but bothlodged official protests. It was not clear whether they werereporting on the same attacks.   The Pakistani government said a U.S.-built Pakistani F-16 shotdown a Soviet-made Su-22 fighter-bomber Thursday morning when twoSu-22's penetrated 10 miles into Pakistan's North-West Frontierprovince.   The Pakistani government said an Afghan pilot was captured andwas being questioned. Pakistan television showed film of thewreckage near the village of Thal, about 160 miles west of Islamabad.   However, Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul later said PakistaniF-16s shot down an Afghan reconaissance jet in the morning and atraining jet in the afternoon.   The Afghan report, monitored in Islamabad Thursday night, saidboth attacks came near the city of Khost, about 12 miles insideAfghanistan. It did identify the type of Afghan planes involved.   Khost is about 36 miles southwest of the Pakistani village ofThal.   The Afghan radio said the communist authorities protested toPakistan over the alleged Pakistani downing of the planes insideAfghanistan.   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Afghan charge d'affairesand launched a ``strong protest'' about the Pakistani claims of anair incursion, officials said.   The ministry later summoned Soviet Ambassador V.P. Yakunin toprotest this week's deployment of the new missiles and otheradvanced aircraft and weapons in Afghanistan, Pakistani televisionsaid.   Western diplomats in Islamabad reported that communist forceshave fired at least six new Soviet SS-1 missiles at guerrillapositions close to the boundary.   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that Soviet-Afghanforces fired a ``powerful missile'' Wednesday night at a guerrillabase near the border.   Late Wednesday, the guerrillas claimed they captured the town ofTokram from government forces after two days of fighting. Afghanguerrillas said they gained control of about 24 miles of the roadleading west to the besieged city of Jalalabad in Afghanistan'sNangarhar province.   Despite the raging civil war between the guerrillas andSoviet-Afghan forces, Pakistan had allowed non-military goods topass through its territory to Torkham, at the foot Pakistan's KhyberPass.   However, guerrillas announced Thursday they were closing the roadto commercial traffic, which could cause shortages of basiccommodities in Jalalabad and Kabul, the Afghan capital.   The United States, which backs the guerrillas along withPakistan, has complained over the Soviet introduction of advancedaircraft and weapons in Afghanistan. The State Department called ita dangerous escalation of the war and a violation of a U.N. accordthat provides for a Soviet troop withdrawal.   In April, the Soviet Union agreed to remove its troops fromAfghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989. Moscow met its pledge to withdraw thefirst half of it forces by Aug. 15, according to U.N. observers, butno major units have left since then.   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
