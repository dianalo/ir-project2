HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> F FIN GOVMTTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co.'s big thrift unit, First Nationwide Bank, publicly acknowledged that it will make a bid to acquire Financial Corp. of America, troubled parent of the nation's largest thrift.    Anthony M. Frank, chairman of First Nationwide, who previously had declined to comment on reports by thrift-industry officials of his interest in Financial Corp., said yesterday, &quot;We are making a bid.&quot;    Mr. Frank said the acquisition of Financial Corp. would be &quot;a way for Ford to expand in an activity with which they're pleased and with which we're familiar.&quot;    Mr. Frank declined to discuss the details of First Nationwide's proposal. However, thrift-industry officials previously said the plan called for Ford to inject about $1 billion of new capital into Financial Corp.'s main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association.    Under the plan, the officials said, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. would absorb as much as 80% of future losses associated with the assets of Financial Corp., which include fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities and various troubled loans and real estate.    Ford has owned San Francisco-based First Nationwide since December 1985. Although First Nationwide is the nation's sixth-largest thrift, with assets of $15 billion, most of its assets are outside California and its market share in the state is only 2%.    Acquiring Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. -- which has $34 billion in assets, 178 branches in California and $17.3 billion in deposits -- would expand First Nationwide's presence in California.    Mr. Frank said First Nationwide will present a proposal next week to Roger Martin, one of three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and members of the Bank Board staff. Mr. Frank said First Nationwide previously had submitted a proposal through Salomon Brothers Inc., which has been retained to help the Bank Board find a rescuer for Financial Corp. It isn't clear whether the new proposal will differ significantly from the earlier one, on which no final action was taken.    An acquisition of Financial Corp. is expected to cost the FSLIC more than $1 billion, and could result in a severe dilution of the interests of Financial Corp. shareholders.    Mr. Frank said First Nationwide estimated that its earlier proposal would cost the FSLIC about $1.4 billion on a current-value basis if interest rates are &quot;relatively stable&quot; over a 10-year period. The cost would rise if interest rates rise. Mr. Frank said Salomon Brothers agreed with the estimate.    However, Roger Martin, one of three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said last week that the Bank Board staff estimates the First Nationwide proposal would cost $3 billion to $4.5 billion over 10 years.    Mr. Frank said First Nationwide would be willing to change the form of its bid if asked by the Bank Board, but said: &quot;We have certain things we can't waive. Certainly Ford needs a return on its money, and certainly we can't jeopardize our institution to solve a problem for the FSLIC.&quot;    Ford would also receive substantial tax benefits by acquiring Financial Corp. The benefits were estimated at perhaps $700 million to $1 billion by officials familiar with Ford's earlier bid.    With $9.14 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, Ford has the resources to make a major acquisition, and has been rumored to be considering several possibilities in the financial services and aerospace industries.    Financial Corp. next week also is expected to present to Mr. Martin an outline of a plan to break up the company into four pieces, which Mr. Martin said was estimated to cost the FSLIC between $1.2 billion and $2 billion. Mr. Frank said that &quot;in the unlikely event that this four-part deal is the cheapest way (for the FSLIC), we'd be glad to look at what's been characterized as the healthy piece.&quot;    However, Mr. Frank said that even that piece of Financial Corp., would present &quot;ample problems&quot; because its would contain billions of dollars of fixed-rate mortgages funded by short-term deposits, the cost of which will rise with interest rates.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., said he &quot;is pleased&quot; that Ford is bidding. &quot;They obviously have the economic wherewithal and the tax motivation,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
