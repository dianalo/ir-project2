The unanimous ruling by the nine justices gave Pennzoil the right to begin immediately seizing control of billions of dollars of Texaco assets. Though attorneys for Texaco were shocked by the ruling and uncertain about their next move, the company repeated its warning that it would seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before giving Pennzoil the opportunity to file liens against its assets.    But Pennzoil said yesterday that it would refrain from exercising its right to &quot;secure&quot; the judgment against Texaco, if only for a brief time. Wishing to do everything possible to prevent Texaco from seeking Chapter 11 protection from creditors' lawsuits, Pennzoil said it would give Texaco the opportunity to plead with the Texas state courts for relief from the bond requirement. Pennzoil, as Texaco's largest unsecured creditor, isn't eager to have a bankruptcy court decide how much Pennzoil will ultimately collect in the case.    Though Texaco previously obtained an injunction in the federal court system against the bond-and-lien rules, it has never asked the Texas state courts to suspend them. And it was in the state court system, the Supreme Court ruled, where Texaco should have taken up the entire matter in the first place.    The ruling touched off frantic selling in Texaco's common, which plunged $4, to close at $33.625 a share, on volume of 5.9 million shares, making it the most active issue in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Pennzoil, meanwhile, rose $6.875, to close at $88.50 a share, also in Big Board trading.    The Supreme Court decision, though pertaining only to a side issue in the case, represented the first of what could be several actions by the high court in the dispute, including another review of the bond issue and perhaps a review of the underlying trial judgment. Pennzoil received the award in November 1985, when a state court jury in Houston found that Texaco had improperly interfered with a merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co. Texaco acquired Getty in January 1984.    The decision increases the pressure on White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco and Houston-based Pennzoil alike to settle the entire case soon -- Pennzoil, to keep Texaco out of bankruptcy court, and Texaco, to prevent Pennzoil from taking control of assets. Indeed, there were indications that Texaco officials could seek to resume face-to-face contact with Pennzoil representatives as early as today in an effort to resolve the bond-and-lien issue, and any discussion of that matter could lead to talks on settling the entire case.    &quot;If you're looking for an environment that says, 'Sharpen your pencils and come to some settlement,' this is certainly a catalyst in that direction,&quot; said Frank W. Morgan, a Houston attorney who was formerly associate general counsel of Gulf Corp. Nevertheless, Texaco President and Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear and Pennzoil Chairman and Chief Executive J. Hugh Liedtke have recently indicated that while they remain willing to settle, the two sides remain as far apart as ever.    Moreover, the bond-and-lien issue alone -- much less the entire case -- probably won't be settled easily. Pennzoil's lawyers said the company is willing to waive the mammoth bond requirement. But they also said that Pennzoil wants some form of security from Texaco -- pledges of assets, for example, or promises not to sell or encumber assets, or possibly a combination of both -- for at least the full amount of Pennzoil's judgment, which with interest currently totals $10.3 billion.    &quot;We want to be fully secured -- one way or another,&quot; said John Jeffers of the Houston law firm of Baker andamp; Botts, which represents Pennzoil. Joe Jamail, Pennzoil's lead outside lawyer, said, &quot;We need assurances that Texaco won't sell off their assets to the detriment of Pennzoil.&quot;    Lawyers for Texaco insisted that the company could never pledge $10 billion or more of assets to Pennzoil. In addition, Alfred C. DeCrane, Texaco chairman, pointed out that promises to keep assets in reserve for Pennzoil could be construed as liens, upon which Texaco's other creditors might look with disfavor. Nevertheless, Mr. DeCrane said, &quot;Reasonable people ought to be able to work something out.&quot;    Texaco was spared from an immediate Chapter 11 filing by a promise that Pennzoil secretly made on March 24 in a letter from Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional scholar representing Pennzoil, to David Boies of the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, Texaco's lead outside counsel. In the letter, which Texaco disclosed yesterday, Mr. Tribe assured Texaco that if the Supreme Court dissolved Texaco's protection from the bond-and-lien rule, then Pennzoil would &quot;take no action whatsoever to enforce&quot; the judgment.    But Mr. Tribe's letter attached one major condition to Pennzoil's promise: Texaco, he said, had to &quot;promptly ask the Texas courts for some suitable form of relief&quot; from the bond-and-lien rules.    By yesterday afternoon, attorneys for Texaco, meeting in Houston, were still confused over exactly where -- and how -- Texaco could seek relief from the bond-and-lien rules. Even the Texas attorney general's office, which had argued strongly to have the matter restored to the jurisdiction of the Texas courts, couldn't immediately say how Texaco should go about seeking the relief. &quot;We are off in the ozone in this case,&quot; said Patrick Wiseman, special assistant to the Texas attorney general. &quot;You're not going to find easy answers from anybody at this point, because it's so far afield of the usual.&quot;    Throughout the Pennzoil-Texaco litigation, one lawyer for Texaco said, Texaco has found no procedure available in Texas for obtaining relief from the rules. &quot;If the Supreme Court, in its infinite wisdom, sees some light in Texas procedure, we're certainly more than willing to try,&quot; the lawyer said. &quot;Right now, we don't know what that avenue is.&quot;    &quot;They better hurry up,&quot; Pennzoil's Mr. Jamail said yesterday. Pennzoil's assurance that it won't begin securing the judgment is good only if Texaco promptly begins seeking resolution of the bond-and-lien controversy in the Texas courts. Asked to define &quot;promptly,&quot; Mr. Jamail said, &quot;They've got till tomorrow,&quot; meaning today.    &quot;Personally, I think Texaco is dead in the water,&quot; said a Houston attorney who last week purchased 100 put options on Texaco shares, betting that an adverse ruling was imminent and that Texaco's share price would fall.    Some analysts, however, clung to their recommendations that Texaco stock remains a favorable, if high-risk, investment. &quot;Texaco doesn't face (a Chapter 11 filing) unless Pennzoil wants it that way,&quot; said William Brown III, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    At a hastily called news conference in White Plains, Texaco Chairman DeCrane tried to calm market reaction to the decision. Tense and tight-lipped, he emphasized that Pennzoil had given its word not to demand the huge bond as long as the matter was being argued in the Texas courts. He said that Texaco already had thoroughly explored the option of seeking bankruptcy-court protection, but quickly added, &quot;I expect there are other ways to deal with this.&quot; Mr. DeCrane cut the session short, citing a pressing schedule, and left through a side door before reporters could ask any follow-up questions.    Yesterday's decision, which occurred several weeks earlier than some lawyers had expected, itself dates to a crisis that Texaco faced shortly after the Houston court verdict was entered. A state court rule required Texaco to post a bond equal to the award, plus interest and costs -- an amount estimated to total $12 billion -- to suspend Pennzoil's right to begin filing liens on Texaco assets. Texaco immediately sued Pennzoil in a federal court in its headquarters city of White Plains, where U.S. District Judge Charles Brieant ruled that the Texas rules violated Texaco's federal right to due process. The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that decision, and Pennzoil appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments last January.    Though unanimous in their decision to dissolve the federal court injunction against the Texas rules, the Supreme Court justices were deeply divided as to their reasons, producing six separate, though concurring, opinions.    The principal opinion, written by Justice Lewis Powell, criticized Texaco's decision to seek federal protection from the state rules. &quot;Denigrations of the procedural protections afforded by Texas law hardly come from Texaco with good grace, as it apparently made no effort under Texas law to secure the relief sought&quot; in the federal court, said Justice Powell, writing for five members.    Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens didn't join Justice Powell's opinion, though all four agreed that Judge Brieant was wrong. Among these four, Justices Marshall and Stevens were highly critical of Texaco's approach and of the federal court ruling, suggesting that Texaco received favorable treatment because of its size. &quot;The price of even-handed administration of justice is especially high in some cases,&quot; Justice Stevens wrote, &quot;but our duty to deal equally with the rich and the poor does not admit . . . a special exemption for multibillion-dollar corporations or transactions.&quot;    And Justice Marshall said &quot;the result would surely have been different&quot; if &quot;the sole proprietor of a small Texas grocery sued&quot; in federal court to be relieved of posting a bond to appeal a $10,000 judgment. &quot;The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions,&quot; he wrote.    Only Justices Brennan and Stevens addressed the merits of Texaco's claim, namely that the Texas bond rule would put Texaco out of business before it ever had the chance to appeal the judgment, thereby depriving the company of its constitutional right to due process.    Justice Brennan said that even if posting the bond forced Texaco to file for reorganization under Chapter 11, &quot;Texaco clearly could exercise its right to appeal in order to protect its corporate interests . . . .&quot; Justice Stevens said that this case isn't &quot;one involving an absolute deprivation of the opportunity to appeal.&quot;    Justice Marshall, in a separate opinion, said the federal courts didn't have jurisdiction over Texaco's case. But he said that if jurisdiction existed, he would agree with Justices Brennan and Marshall that Texaco's rights weren't violated.    Justice Blackmun, alone, showed some sympathy for Texaco's plight, criticizing in a footnote the assertion by Justices Brennan and Stevens that Texaco could appeal if it were in Chapter 11. This &quot;strikes me as somewhat at odds with the reality of the corporate reorganization that might occur in bankruptcy,&quot; Justice Blackmun said. He added an &quot;overlooked fact&quot; that &quot;Pennzoil . . . is not a corner grocery store.&quot;    In a somewhat unusual move, the high court ordered that its decision dissolving the federal court injunction against the Texas rules take effect immediately. Normally, Supreme Court orders don't take effect for 25 days, and then the effect can be delayed even longer by filing a request for rehearing, a procedure rarely granted. But Justice Powell's opinion ordered that the court's judgment be issued &quot;forthwith,&quot; and court officials said the order was mailed yesterday morning.    Texaco lawyers said that the bond issue could quickly wind up back in the lap of the Supreme Court. No matter where Texaco begins its quest for relief -- whether in the initial trial court, in a Texas court of civil appeals, or in the Texas Supreme Court -- it eventually could request further Supreme Court review by proving that it finally had &quot;exhausted its remedies&quot; in the Texas state courts.    ---          Pennzoil vs. Texaco: Billion Dollar Battle   Nov. 19, 1985 -- Texas jury awards Pennzoil $10.53billion.
