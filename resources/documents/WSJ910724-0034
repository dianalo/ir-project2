Now for the badnews: It's starting to cool off.   &quot;In a way, it's a shame the heat wave has broken,&quot; saysMark Howard, administrator at Olin Arts Center at BatesCollege in Lewiston, Maine. With the temperature hoveringaround 90 degrees Monday evening, a concert at theair-conditioned center attracted twice the average audience,including plenty who rarely attend.</LP><TEXT>   As the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. finally begins tocool a bit after its hottest period in a decade, some folksare having mixed feelings. Libraries and museums, race tracksand movie theaters -- not to mention makers of fans, airconditioners, dehumidifiers, soft drinks and deodorants --benefited from the record-breaking temperatures that hadmillions of Americans looking for relief.   Not all businesses fared so well. Just about everythingthat required outdoor exertion (and didn't have anything todo with water) was chilled out.   Still, while some relief-seekers headed to the beach,others sought out air-conditioned interiors. Business hasincreased more than 50% over normal at Grand Slam USA, aPittsburgh sports bar, where the customers shoot pinball andplay miniature golf in cool comfort. &quot;I used to fill up theCoke machine once a week,&quot; says sales clerk Dave Burger said.&quot;Now I do it every other day.&quot;   Attendance at the Detroit Institute of Arts shot up 28%last week compared to normal. As Sunday's temperature neared100 degrees, about 600 people crowded into Boston's ComputerMuseum, more than twice the normal attendance.   Atlanta's High Museum of Art, a sleek white building withregulated humidity (50% v. 80% outside) and temperature (70degrees), recently drew 1,700 people to a &quot;Cool Off at theHigh&quot; party -- more than double last year's crowd. The museumserved Perrier, ice cream and frozen margaritas -- and signedon five times the usual number of members for such an event.   Overall, attendance at the High is up 10% over lastsummer. Part of the reason may be the building's design,which one comedian has likened to &quot;a big refrigerator,&quot; saysspokeswoman Ann Wilson. &quot;The fact that they're coming indroves shows the heat is helping,&quot; she adds.   Libraries -- which usually are all but empty on pleasantsummer weekends -- have become hot spots. &quot;Folks are spendinga lot of time in the air-conditioned libraries,&quot; says BobCraneberger, director of the Carnegie Libraries inPittsburgh. He has instructed his staff not to interruptthose who come to cool down. &quot;Dozing is okay, but notsnoring,&quot; he says.   Some places are even using the heat as a marketing tool.At the Waring Theater in Rochester, N.Y., a recordedtelephone message says, &quot;Thanks for calling the WaringTheater -- the air-conditioned Waring Theater.&quot;   Water sells, too. Mountain Streams and Trails has seen a20% increase in its rafting tours on the Youghioghany Riverin Ohio, which cost $24 to $49.   Surprisingly, saunas and hot tubs are selling at the Landof Ahhs spa store in Kansas City, Kan. &quot;People come in forpools and buy a sauna or a hot tub at the same time,&quot; sayssalesman John Rabeler. Pool sales? Triple in recent weeks,Mr. Rabeler says.   Car dealers say the hot weather hasn't kept customersaway. Dan Myers, a new-car salesman at Walt Sweeney WestHills Ford in Cincinnati, says salespeople run the airconditioning in test cars to make sure they're cool beforeconsumers climb in. &quot;Then when customers test drive, it'smore pleasant,&quot; he says.   But businesses that depend on the customers enjoyingoutdoor activities haven't fared so well. The number ofgolfers at Pittsburgh's North Golf Club has dropped to about200 a day from 250. Business has plummeted at Dilly Dally'sGolf andamp; Games in Marietta, Ga., where 25% fewer people come toplay miniature golf. Most players stay for only one game now,compared with four games in normal times. &quot;It's so hoteverybody stands where the air conditioning is or goes to thelake,&quot; says Dale Holcomb, general manager.   Bicycle rentals have been down 20% at Skate Escape, a bikeand skate store near Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and riders stayout only for an hour -- less than half as long as theynormally rent. &quot;For people not used to biking, the heat willbeat them down,&quot; says Robert Orlowski, owner.   Trendy roller-blade rentals, however, have doubled, Mr.Orlowski says, and all 80 pairs usually go out every weekend.The heat is causing a big problem, though: Skaters aresweating up their knee and wrist pads, and the store has torun the heat in the back room to dry them out.   Bryant's Landscaping in Detroit complains that the hightemperatures and blazing sun have kept grass from growing.Bernard Bryant, owner, says people who normally get theirgrass cut once a week now want it cut every two weeks.   At the Fertile Delta garden center in Chicago's LincolnPark neighborhood, a 40%-off sale around the July 4 holiday&quot;helped us get through what would have been a fairly deadtime,&quot; says co-owner Peter MacBride. While the heat wave hascut into business, there are some pluses. The hot weathercaused many perennials and flowering shrubs to bloom and fadeearlier than normal. That sent some people to Fertile Deltato buy annuals &quot;to get more color&quot; in their gardens, says Mr.MacBride.   Still, at Somerville Lumber, a huge hardware emporium inSomerville, Mass., only about half the usual number ofshoppers showed up Saturday -- and many were there for fansand air conditioners rather than garden hoes or hammers andnails. &quot;People just can't be out there working in the garden,fixing the roof, or renovating a room on days like this,&quot;said assistant store manager Mike Carvalho.   Pizzeria Uno also reported less business at its chainrestaurants this past week. &quot;People just don't want to comeout of the house,&quot; said Kevin Linhoff, supervisor of aPizzeria Uno on New York's Upper West Side. &quot;When it's thishot, your appetite is not as strong as it should be.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
