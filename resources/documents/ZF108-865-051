(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Serial I/O Gets GaAs'edandM;Close on the heels of last year's HOT ROD chip set for 1 Gbit/sec serial I/O,Gazelle has introduced boards and development systems incorporating theseparts.andP;  These products represent a new class of building block for systemdesigners: serial I/O with the bandwidth of a 32-bit microprocessor bus.andO;Gazelle suggests using them for connections between processors, eithernetworks of personal computers and workstations or parallel multiprocessorsystems, and for connections between processors and high-bandwidth peripheraldevices, such as graphics displays and disk drives.andM;Gazelle specializes in products made from gallium arsenide (GaAs).andO;Currently, their only other products are GaAs versions of theindustry-standard 22V10 PLD.andP;  The HOT ROD chips are fabricated by TriQuintSemiconductor.andM;The ChipsandM;The HOT ROD chip set consists of two GaAs devices, the GA9011 transmitter andthe GA9012 receiver.andP;  The 1.25 GHz internal clock is generated using PLLs ineach chip; the receiver clock is synchronized to the transmitter clock, andthe transmitter clock is synchronized to either a free-running oscillator (20to 25 MHz, on-chip oscillator with off-chip crystal) or an external clocksignal.andP;  The clock frequency is slightly higher than the information transferrate because of the transmission format.andM;As shown in Figure 1, the transmitter accepts 40 parallel bits of data usinga simple strobe/acknowledge handshake.andP;  The data is converted into the 4B/5Bencoding used by the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard.andP;  The4B/5B encoding maps each group of four bits into five bauds.andP;  (A baud is aserial signalling unit, which contains less than one &quot;bit&quot; of informationbecause of the 4B/5B encoding.)andP;  The bauds are then serialized and convertedto an NRZI representation, in which a zero is a steady signal level, and aone is a change between signal levels.andM;The sixteen 5-baud codes used to represent 4 bits of information wereselected to avoid conditions in which more than three consecutive bauds arezero.andP;  This ensures that signal transitions occur frequently enough for thereceiver's PLL to remain synchronized to the data stream.andP;  The output is adifferential pair, with 4.2 V for a typical logic high and 3.2 V for atypical logic low.andM;The receiver takes in the differential pair and produces 40 bits of paralleloutput.andP;  A strobe signal indicates when valid data is being presented.andM;When no data is available, the transmitter sends a code that maintainssynchronization without causing invalid data to be strobed out of thereceiver.andP;  If synchronization is lost, the receiver asserts an error signalwhile attempting to regain synchronization.andM;The chips consume only two watts each, so heat sinks and exotic packaging arenot required.andP;  For operation at gigahertz speed, however, the packages werecustom-designed by Gazelle for improved power distribution and decoupling.andM;The BoardsandM;Three different transceiver boards using both chips are available, one foroptical fiber and two for coaxial cable.andP;  The HRC-250F uses multimode fiberfor a maximum data rate of 250 Mbits/sec for distances up to one kilometer.andO;(A1 Gbit/sec Fiber-optic interface card is under development.)andP;  The board iscurrently being manufactured using optical receivers and transmitters fromATandamp;T, but the board is also designed to accept modules from Sumitomo and PCO.andO;The board contains no components other than the HOT ROD chips and the fiberoptic receivers and transmitters.andM;For shorter-distance connections, the HRC-400C and HRC-1000C use coaxialcable for maximum data rates of 400 and 1000 Mbit/sec, respectively, fordistances up to 100 feet.andP;  The input can be either a differential paid or asingle-ended signal; an amplifier is included on the board to convert asingle-ended signal to a differential pair.andP;  Except for this amplifier, theboards contain only the HOT ROD chips.andM;The boards all use the same 3.75 x 4 inch card size and 120-pin high-densityconnector, so systems can easily be upgraded to higher speed or opticalfiber.andM;The Development SystemandM;An 8051-based development system is offered for exercising any of the threeinterface cards.andP;  It includes an RS-232 interface and a menu-driven softwaremonitor, so that tests may be run from a terminal or personal computer.andP;  ACentronics-type parallel port is also provided.andM;Two 1K x 40 FIFOs sit between the 8051 and the interface card, one forassembling transmit data and one for use either as a receive buffer or as abuffer between the receiver and transmitter.andP;  The development system allowsindividual transmissions to be sent and received, as well as continuousrecirculation of a test pattern.andP;  In the latter mode, errors can be logged tothe parallel port for long unattended measurements of error rate.andM;ConclusionandM;The HOT ROD chips are a neat, simple solution for high-bandwidth channelsover short and medium distances.andP;  They are most suited to applications nowserved by shielded ribbon cable.andP;  Gazelle's biggest obstacle initially willbe re-educating system designers to the possibility of replacing these cableswith a two-wire interface.andP;  The relatively high price will also be anobstacle for many applications.andM;These chips could have a dramatic effect on system design once the pricecomes down.andP;  At the current price, they have few appropriate applicationsoutside of mainframe computers and high-end workstations.andP;  In the future,however, these chips might become a standard interface layer, replacing (orredefining) standards such as SCSI.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
