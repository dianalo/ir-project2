On Saturday, orders totaled nearly 200,000 contracts valued at about five trillion yen ($36.7 billion). The debut volume exceeded even the most optimistic expectations of officials at the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange, where the two stock index contracts are traded. Even more surprising was the strong performance of the contract traded in Osaka, where trading far surpassed Tokyo's.    &quot;It was an overwhelming success,&quot; said Mark Arimura, a vice president with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd.    Not surprisingly, trading tapered off Monday. The total number of contracts traded dropped to about 37,000, with a total underlying value of about 920 billion yen.    The introduction of cash-settled stock index futures in Japan adds an important dimension to trading in the world's most heavily capitalized equity market. One of the indexes, the Tokyo stock price index, measures the performance of 1,117 stocks listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the contracts are traded. The other, the Nikkei index, is an average of 225 major Japanese stocks and is traded on the Osaka Securities Exchange.    The new contracts provide investors with a chance to hedge their investments and to speculate on trends in the Japanese economy. It also enables them to arbitrage between the two index contracts, as well as between the cash and futures markets.    More significant, the new contracts provide investors with the means to short the market. Until now, the only way institutional investors could protect themselves against declines in equity prices was to buy the the Osaka 50 index contract, a physical delivery contract that started trading last year, or a Nikkei contract traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.    In the long run, some analysts believe that short-selling could alter the behavior of the Tokyo market, which tends to be bullish even when other markets are not. The Tokyo market, for example, did not fall as hard as other markets during the October stock market crash, largely because brokerages persuaded major investors to support the market.    &quot;Futures can trigger a panic decline in the market,&quot; said Toshio Yokoyama, a manager in the investment technology strategy and planning department at Nikko Securities Co. But he added that brokerage firms will be under tremendous pressure not to provoke a repeat of Black Monday. &quot;Brokerage firms here have to say the market will go up,&quot; said Mr. Yokoyama.    Analysts say the ability to sell the market short will make a big difference to foreign investors. Those who find the sky-high price-earnings ratios of Japanese shares frightening will now have a way to protect themselves and thus may be more willing to participate in the Japanese market. &quot;Foreigners will be more active in this market knowing how liquid it is,&quot; said Mr. Arimura of Salomon Brothers.    But most analysts agree that it will take a while for the waves of the opening splash to subside to see just how the futures market will affect the cash market. &quot;It takes at least a month for any new contract to gain its land legs,&quot; said William Grossman, a managing director of the Chicago Board of Trade.    Saturday's volume figures show uncertainty about the longer-term use of futures. On both exchanges, nearly all the volume was in the near-month December contracts. On the Tokyo exchange, 77,443 out of 77,470 contracts traded to settle in December. On the Osaka exchange, 121,359 of 121,378 contracts were for December delivery. No contracts were traded on either exchange for June 1989 settlement, and only a small number for March and September 1989. Similarly, on Monday, nearly all the trading was in the December contracts.    On Monday, the December Topix contract closed down 26 at 2124, while in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading the index closed the day at 2112.82. The December Nikkei contract finished down 210 at 27640, compared with its close of 27341.58 on the stock exchange.    While most of the uncertainty about the new contracts stems from their newness, analysts said another reason is that a bad image of futures lingers in the minds of many institutional investors. No one has forgotten the 1987 incident in which Tateho Chemical Industries Co. sustained huge losses in government bond futures trading. And only last month did the Japanese government decide to allow investors to trade financial futures overseas.    But Nomura Securities Co. was hardly tentative in its support of the new contracts Saturday. Sadao Sudo, deputy general manager at Nomura, said the firm accounted for about 25% of the trading on the two exchanges. Most analysts expect Nomura, the world's largest brokerage, to be as big a mover in the futures market as it is in the cash market.    Some observers are worried that that kind of power, combined with program trading techniques, could be extremely dangerous. But experts say that program trading of the kind that contributed to the volatility of the New York stock market during the October crash is still a long way off. Japanese brokerage firms are yet not allowed to hook up direct computer lines to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
