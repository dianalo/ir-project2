Richard Greenfield, a Haverford, Pa., attorney, notified the thrift last August that he would file a shareholder derivative suit to recover losses pertaining to bad commercial real estate loans unless the thrift acted itself.    The thrift's board ratified the committee's finding.    Mr. Greenfield said he and the six holders he represents would evaluate the report before determining whether to take legal action. The six holders own about 1,000 of Florida Federal's approximately 9.4 million shares outstanding.    For the year ended June 30, Florida Federal had a loss of $65.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
