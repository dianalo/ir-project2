The Boardalso has jurisdiction over appeals authorized by any law, rule, or regulationother than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a). Examples of such otherwise appealable actionsare generally listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(1)-(19).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1209.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Jurisdiction.</ITAG>Subject to 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3), the Board has jurisdiction over appealsby an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment with respectto a personnel action taken, proposed, threatened, or not taken becauseof the individual's whistleblowing activities, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8).Where it is alleged that a personnel action within the Board's jurisdictionwas based on whistleblowing, the Board may also stay the personnel action.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1209.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope.</ITAG>This part governs any appeal where the appellant alleges that a personnelaction defined in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2) was threatened, proposed, taken,or not taken because of the individual's whistleblowing activities. Includedare Individual Right of Action appeals authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) andother appealable actions where a law, rule, or regulation authorizes adirect appeal to the Board and the appellant alleges that the agency actionwas based on his or her whistleblowing activities. Subpart C of this partgoverns any request for a stay of a personnel action allegedly based onthe appellant's whistleblowing activities.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1209.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application of 5 CFR Part 1201.</ITAG>Where appropriate and unless provided otherwise, the Board shall applySubparts A, B, C, E, F, and G of 5 CFR Part 1201 to appeals and stay requestsgoverned by this Part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1209.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>(a) ``Personnel action'' means, as to individuals and agencies coveredby 5 U.S.C. 2302:(1) An appointment;(2) A promotion;(3) An adverse action under Chapter 75 of Title 5, United States Code orother disciplinary or corrective action;(4) A detail, transfer, or reassignment;(5) A reinstatement;(6) A restoration;(7) A reemployment;(8) A performance evaluation under Chapter 43 of Title 5, United StatesCode;(9) A decision concerning pay, benefits, or awards, or concerning educationor training if the education or training may reasonably be expected tolead to an appointment, promotion, performance evaluation, or other personnelaction; or(10) Any other significant change in duties or responsibilities which isinconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level.(b) ``Whistleblowing'' includes: (1) Any disclosure of information by anemployee, former employee, or applicant that the individual reasonablybelieves evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or grossmismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantialand specific danger to public health or safety, if such disclosure is notspecifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specificallyrequired by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of nationaldefense or the conduct of foreign affairs; or(2) Any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the Inspector Generalof an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency toreceive such disclosures, of information which the individual reasonablybelieves evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or grossmismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantialand specific danger to public health or safety.(c) An ``Individual Right of Action'' is an appeal, authorized by 5 U.S.C.1221, of a personnel action that the appellant alleges was threatened,proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowingactivities. Before filing an Individual Right of Action with the Board,the appellant must have sought corrective action from the Special Counsel,and, as required by 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3), exhausted those proceedings. IndividualRight of Action appeals are governed by Part 1209.(d) An ``otherwise appealable action'' means an agency action that is directlyappealable to the Board under a law, rule, or regulation which does notrequire the individual to first seek corrective action from the SpecialCounsel and which was allegedly taken because of the appellant's whistleblowingactivities. Examples of the types of personnel actions which may be appealeddirectly to the Board without the requirement that the individual firstseek corrective action from the Special Counsel are generally listed in5 CFR 1201.3(a)(1)-(19). If an individual is authorized under a law, rule,or regulation to file an appeal directly with the Board, but elects toseek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to theBoard, the appeal to the Board is still an otherwise appealable actionwhich is governed by this Part if the individual alleges that the actionwas taken because of whistleblowing.(e) The following examples illustrate some of the differences between anIndividual Right of Action and an otherwise appealable action.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>Agency A gives Mr. X a performance evaluation under5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 which rates him as ``minimally satisfactory.'' Mr.X believes that the agency has rated him ``minimally satisfactory'' becauseof his whistleblowing activities. Because a performance evaluation is not,standing alone, an action which is directly appealable to the Board undera law, rule, or regulation, Mr. X must first seek corrective action fromthe Special Counsel concerning the evaluation before appealing to the Boardor before seeking a stay of the evaluation from the Board. If Mr. X appealsthe evaluation to the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminatedor exhausted, his appeal is an Individual Right of Action appeal that isgoverned by Part 1209 of the Board's regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>Agency B removes Ms. Y for alleged misconduct under5 U.S.C. 7513. Ms. Y believes that the agency removed her because of herwhistleblowing activities. Because the removal action is directly appealableto the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7513, Ms. Y may elect to file an appeal withthe Board without first seeking corrective action from the Special Counselor she may seek corrective action from the Special Counsel and then appealto the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminated or exhausted,as provided in 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3). In either case, her appeal to the Boardis governed by Part 1209 if she alleges that the removal action was takenbecause of her whistleblowing activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Appeals of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on Whistleblowing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1209.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Filing of petitions for appeal and responses.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Requirement for termination or exhaustion of Special Counsel proceedingin Individual Right of Action appeals. </T3>Except in a case in which anemployee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right toappeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation, the individualshall first seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealingto the Board concerning a personnel action allegedly based on whistleblowing.(b) <T3>Place of filing. </T3>Petitions for appeal shall be filed at the appropriateBoard regional office as set forth in 5 CFR 1201.4(d).(c) <T3>Time of filing. </T3>(1) Direct appeals to the Board: Where an individualseeks corrective action directly from the Board concerning an otherwiseappealable action allegedly based on whistleblowing without first seekingcorrective action from the Special Counsel, the time for filing the appealis governed by 5 CFR 1201.22(b).
