Panamanian Ambassador Jorge Eduardo Ritter, speaking before theU.N. General Assembly's special session on disarmament, cited a``gigantic campaign of aggression unleashed by the government of theUnited States against Panama.''   Ritter claimed the U.S. National Security Council prepared a planto destabilize the Panamanian government and thus open a way to``legally abrogate the (Canal) treaties.''   Ritter said the alleged plan was drafted April 8, 1986, but hedid not reveal any details on how the Panamanian goverment wasinformed about its existence.   The U.S. government has used economic sanctions to try to forcePanamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega from power. Noriega, who is indictedin Florida on cocaine trafficking charges, is head of the15,000-member Defense Forces and de facto ruler of the country.   Max L. Friedersdorf, a U.S. representative, protested thePanamanian statement in the General Assembly.   ``My delegation must protest the attempt by the representative ofPanama to confuse this session and waste this body's valuable timewith inaccurate and unnecessary attacks against the United States,''said Friedersdorf, alternate representative to the disarmamentsession and representative to arms control talks.   ``The people of Panama and the United States have long enjoyed aclose friendship and working relationship,'' he said. ``Thegovernment and people of the United States sympathize with thosePanamanians who are attempting to restore genuine civilian democracyto Panama.''   ``The United States recognizes, however, that it will not be easyfor them to reverse two decades of military control in Panama. TheUnited States government, of course, remains fully committed tofulfilling its agreement under the Panama Canal Treaty.''   The 1977 treaties between the United States and Panama obligesWashington to hand over to Panama complete control of the waterwayand U.S. military installations by midday Dec. 31, 1999.</TEXT></DOC>
