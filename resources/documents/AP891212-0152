Ex-Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez, also a former armycolonel, was flown to Miami on Monday with the approval ofPresident Jaime Paz Zamora.   Paz Zamora, who arrived in Argentina Tuesday for a two-dayvisit, told reporters there, ``It was a political decision that Iadopted personally.'' He said Arce Gomez faces numerous charges inBolivia and the government reserved the right to request his return``when it believes that necessary.''   Paz Zamora had said in La Paz that because of corruption inBolivia's judicial system there was no assurance Arce Gomez wouldstand trial here.   Last week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of Juan CarlosLisboa Melgar, considered one of the country's top drugtraffickers, ``for lack of evidence.'' And a Colombian chemist andtwo other suspects accused of cocaine trafficking escaped fromdetention over the weekend.   Edgar Oblitas Fernandez, president of the Supreme Court, saidArce Gomez should have been tried by Bolivian courts and he expects``a convincing explanation from the government.''   A citizens' committee pressing for trials in Bolivia of ArceGomez and ex-President Luis Garcia Meza issued a statement saying,``We believe the judicial norms of the country have been violatedsince an extradition treaty with the U.S. does not exist.''   The Rev. Julio Tumiri, president of the Bolivian Human RightsAssembly, said, ``The government's decision represents an affrontto our sovereignty and a violation of Bolivian law whichestablishes that crimes committed on Bolivian soil must be tried inthe country.''   Supreme Court charges against Arce Gomez range from theft togenocide, involving the killings of critics.   Arce Gomez appeared Tuesday in Miami before U.S. MagistrateWilliam Turnoff and was ordered held without bond ondrug-trafficking charges that could send him to prison for 30years. An arraignment and formal bond hearing was set for Dec. 26.   Gen. Garcia Meza came to power in a military coup in July 1980and appointed Arce Gomez interior minister _ the top lawenforcement post.   Garcia Meza resigned in August 1981 and both he and Arce Gomezfled Bolivia before an elected government was installed in 1982.   Arce Gomez, known as the ``cocaine minister,'' went toArgentina. He was arrested there under the Miami indictment, issuedin 1983 on two counts of drug trafficking, but was freed inDecember 1983 by Argentina's outgoing military regime before acivilian government came to power.   He was arrested Sunday night at a ranch near Santa Cruz, 350miles east of La Paz.   Garcia Meza returned to Bolivia in 1988 and his lawyers said hewas ready to reply to charges against him. But he fled again whenthe Congress early in 1989 accused him of theft and corruption. Heis sought by police but it is believed he has left Bolivia.   Paz Zamora said in Buenos Aires that Arce Gomez and Garcia Mesatried to ``set up a Bolivian government on the base of narcoticstrafficking, and unite the economic power of narcotics traffickingwith the political power of the state, which is what (some) want todo today in Colombia.''</TEXT></DOC>
