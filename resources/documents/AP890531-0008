Others dart in during daylight, often as shells and rocketsexplode around them and knots of people stand on shore and cheer.   The ships' cargoes have become the lifeline for the estimated 1million Christians trapped in their enclave north of Beirut.   ``This is why there are no serious shortages,'' said a policespokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.``The ships bring in vegetables, canned fruit and cattle as well asammunition.''   Not all the provisions are essentials. An east Beirutbusinessman said one company recently received 11 containers ofwhisky.   The police spokesman said at least 12 ships a day make itthrough the Syrian blockade. They dock mainly at Jounieh, 12 milesnorth of Beirut, and the ancient port of Byblos, 10 miles farthernorth, and at smaller harbors in between.   Christian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said twoor three ships out of every 15 carry weapons and ammunition fromIraq, Syria's main Arab rival and the Christians' only ally in theMiddle East.   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil warbegan on March 8 when Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun ordered histroops, most of whom are Christians, to blockade ports run byMoslem militias. Fierce artillery battles followed and the Syriansblockaded Christian ports.   Despite a cease-fire called by the Arab League on May 11, theSyrians shell the Christians' coastal strip daily to try to preventsupplies from reaching Aoun's forces.   In recent days, the Syrians have deployed navy gunboats totighten the blockade, and some cargo ships have been turned back.   Yet some Christians believe the Syrians are not tightening thenoose as much as they might.   ``With the firepower the Syrians have they could be doing a lotmore,'' one source said. ``We don't know why there is thisrestraint, except possibly because they're not yet prepared to goall the way.''   The danger zone is about six miles off the coast.   Boutros Sassine, 23, was a crewman aboard the 1,000-ton Lebanesefreighter Paula, which took several hits on May 18 as it approachedOqaibeh, five miles north of Jounieh, with a cargo of food.   He and three other crewmen were wounded when a Syrian 130mmshell hit the mast.   Lying in St. George's Hospital in east Beirut, his head heavilybandaged, Boutros said the freighter was about five miles offOqaibeh ``when the shells started falling all around us.''   ``Some of them were hitting only a few feet away, sendingcascades of water over us. Then we were hit. I saw my brotherBoulos and the others fall,'' he said.   ``A fishing boat which was in the vicinity came through theshelling and took us ashore,'' Boutros said.   A Christian source said that most of the ship captains come fromthe Oqaibeh area.   ``Their agency pays them about $5,000 a trip,'' he said. ``Theseamen who used to earn $200 a month now get $200 a trip, whichusually lasts between 24 and 48 hours.''   The ships sail mainly between the Christian enclave and Cyprus,100 miles to the northeast. But Christian sources reported thatsome also pick up cargoes of fruit and vegetables from the southernports of Sidon and Tyre, both run by Moslem militias.   A police spokesman in Sidon said merchants charter boats to takeproduce to the Christian enclave.   ``They don't want to waste their produce,'' he said. ``They'reready to sell to the devil.''   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia, which controls Tyre, tried tostop merchants there from sending goods to east Beirut.   But sources said the businessmen, who pay hefty fees to Amal,told the militia they would stop only if the militia bought alltheir produce.   The traffic is not all one-way. About 15,000 Christians havefled the enclave aboard ferries from Cyprus. The vessels anchoroffshore, and passengers must take a nerve-jangling ride in smallboats in darkness _ and often under shellfre _ to reach the ferries.   Hundreds more have evacuated aboard a Norwegian Hovercraft, theSanta Maria, which slips into Jounieh and other ports at night.</TEXT></DOC>
