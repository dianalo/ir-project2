Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, acknowledging that ``we're hanging by ourfingernails,'' announced Friday he has purchased 30 minutes oftelevision time tonight and he challenged Bush to join him ``todiscuss the issues.''   The vice president rejected a one-on-one debate with Dole.   ``That ploy has been used before,'' he said during an appearancebefore the Illinois Farm Bureau. ``I may have used it before whenthings weren't going too well. But debates are cruel and unusualpunishment. We've already had seven of them.''   During an appearance at the University of Illinois, Dukakis toldreporters that if he can beat Sen. Paul Simon on the senator's homeground ``it would be a turning point'' in the Democraticpresidential race.   A smiling Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, took time out from heavycampaigning to feast on flaming saganaki, or fried cheese, andsquid at the Greek Islands restaurant in Chicago's ``Greektown''section. The candidate scheduled no speech there but stopped oftento shake hands with others dining at the restaurant.   Dukakis, whose parents were natives of Greece, said he is nottrying to build an ethnic coalition.   ``We want to put together a coalition of people all over thiscountry, whether they're first-generation or second-generationAmericans,'' he said.   The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board announced it would endorseBush and Dukakis in Sunday's editions. The board praised Bush's``variety and texture of public experience'' and said Dukakis ishis party's strongest contender to regain th White House.   The rival Chicago Tribune on Friday endorsed Dole, saying he hasoften been ``the lone Republican voice of reason and good sense onmatters of budget and foreign affairs.'' The Tribune had made noendorsement in the Democratic race.   As expected, Gary Hart announced his departure from theDemocratic race on Friday. ``I got a fair hearing and the peopledecided,'' said the former Colorado senator.   Jesse Jackson was the winner of a non-binding straw vote takenThursday night during Alaska's Democratic caucuses. Jacksonreceived 35 percent of the vote to 30 percent for Dukakis, thestate party announced Friday.   Jackson campaigned Friday in South Carolina which holdsDemocratic caucuses today and he was given a strong chance ofwinning a majority of the delegates in his native state. Hisprincipal competition in the state came from Sen. Albert Gore Jr.of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.   Simon insisted he would carry Illinois in Tuesday's presidentialprimary and that no candidate would have a first-ballot nominationat the Democratic National Convention next July.   ``I think I have as good a chance as anyone,'' said Simon, as hecampaigned in the Chicago area.   Simon said he believed that New York Gov. Mario Cuomo'sstatement that he would endorse a Democratic presidential candidatebefore his state's presidential primary on April 19 meant thatCuomo is waiting for the results of the Illinois primary.   However, Simon could take less encouragement from a Cuomostatement on Friday when the governor said he thought the Democratsought to unite behind whichever candidate has the most delegates atthe end of the primary season.   ``If Mike Dukakis has 41 percent, get everybody together in aroom and say, `Jesse, Gore, Gephardt, you came close, but Mike'sthe candidate,''' said Cuomo. ``Let's pick the guy who's aheadafter California.''   Campaigning around the state, Dole conceded that ``we're hangingby our fingernails. We shouldn't be but we are. We need to somehowcapture the attention of the Illinois voters.''   In an effort to accomplish that, the Dole campaign has spent$100,000 to buy 30 minutes on Chicago television station WGN for alive broadcast from Knox College in Galesburg which was the site ofone of the debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas.   Dole refused to discuss the format for the broadcast except tosay, ``I'll be there.''   ``I know he's ahead,'' Dole said of Bush. ``He knows he'sahead.''   He said, ``The voters of Illinois can make history Tuesday bedemanding that we discuss the issues.''   Bush also will be in Galesburg and Dole was asked if he mightpersonally confront the vice president in an effort to engage himin debate.   ``I doubt it,'' he said. ``No gimmicks, no games.''</TEXT></DOC>
