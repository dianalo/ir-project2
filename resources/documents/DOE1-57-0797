However, heavy metals are toxic to cells once their levelsexceed their low physiological values. The toxicity of heavy metals onmicroorganisms, and on animals has been well-documented. These interactionsmay induce the alteration of the primary as well as secondary structuresof the DNA and result in mutation(s). The present communication reportsthe results in determining the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of tenheavy metals commonly found in polluted areas by using the Salmonella/mammalian-microsomemutagenicity test.</TEXT></DOC>
