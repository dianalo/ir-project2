The fiscal 1992 authorization measure, for example, wouldbuck the White House's top two priorities by suspendingpurchases of B-2 Stealth bombers and slashing research onspace-based missile defenses. At the same time, lawmakersprovided some $1.3 billion to resurrect a pair ofconventional weapons -- the F-117 Stealth fighter and theMarine Corps' V-22 tilt-rotor troop transport -- that thePentagon doesn't want.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would set aside as much as $1 billion to aid theSoviet Union; that fund could be tapped to airlifthumanitarian supplies, provide assistance to destroy nuclearweapons or even help the Kremlin convert military plants tocivilian uses.   But the final version of the package, announced Fridayafter six weeks of negotiations and a last-minute dust-upover the humanitarian aid section, offered Mr. Bush animportant victory. Lawmakers for the first time agreed on aspecific plan, and even set a tentative timetable, fordeployment of super-sophisticated ground-based interceptorsintended to protect the U.S. from accidental Soviet or ThirdWorld missile attacks.   A total of $4.15 billion would be authorized for theso-called Strategic Defense Initiative, which is intended todevelop defenses against short-range and long-range missiles.The final language in the bill would envision placing theinterceptors around a single site at Grand Forks, N.D.,around 1996 -- a plan designed to allow their deploymentwithout requiring that the U.S. renegotiate or renounce thecurrent Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. At the same time, thebill would relegate development of space-based interceptors,dubbed Brilliant Pebbles, to the back burner.   Both the House and Senate soon are expected to approve thebill without much debate. Despite previous White Housewarnings about a possible veto, Pentagon officials on Fridayindicated that, barring unexpected problems in working outfinal details, they expect Mr. Bush will agree to sign thebill. Sen. John Warner (R., Va.), the Pentagon's point manfor the bill, indicated he expects it to be signed.   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D.,Wis.) said the measure reflects &quot;a basic realignment in theway we think about defense.&quot; He added that &quot;the oldcategories&quot; dividing conservatives from liberals &quot;don't workwell anymore.&quot; Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, Rep. Aspin'scounterpart in the Senate, said the measure &quot;continues anorderly, prudent build-down&quot; of the U.S. military withoutsacrificing the nation's capability to &quot;effectively meet thethreats of the future.&quot;   But in shaping the package -- the first major defense billsince the unsuccessful Kremlin coup and subsequent politicaldisintegration of the Soviet Union -- domestic politicalconsiderations seemed to figure just as prominently aschanges in the international landscape. Many lawmakers, infact, talked about the bill as the opening of the partisanelection-year debate over defense spending that is expectedto preoccupy Congress for much of 1992.   Lawmakers broke new ground by authorizing female Air Forceand Navy pilots to begin flying combat missions. And, as inprevious years, both House and Senate members balked atapproving deep personnel cuts that Defense Secretary DickCheney claims are needed in politically popular NationalGuard and reserve units. The bill embraces theadministration's goal of shrinking the number of active-dutypersonnel by about 100,000 to below 1.9 million by nextSeptember. However, lawmakers approved only about one-thirdof the 100,000-plus reduction in reserve forces requested bythe Pentagon, and they barred Secretary Cheney from relyingon involuntary reductions and forced retirements to meetlower manpower limits.   Other portions of the bill would:   -- Override administration recommendations and continuedevelopment of a mobile version of the Midgetmannuclear-tipped missile.   -- Authorize more than $1.65 billion for the C-17 cargoplane, but restrict expenditures pending resolution ofmanufacturing problems and cost overruns.   -- Make further B-2 purchases contingent on test resultsand on separate House and Senate votes next year to spend themoney. Echoing the sentiments of B-2 critics, Rep. RonDellums (D., Calif.) said the new hurdles &quot;sound the deathknell for the bomber.&quot;   -- Terminate all funding to modify Navy F-14 fighters,while authorizing more than $2.5 billion to upgrade andpurchase additional F/A-18s.</TEXT></DOC>
