The telephone solicitation campaign came at a disturbing momentfor many Jews in this country. They have watched with increasingdistress and horror as Palestinians rioted in Israel's occupiedterritories, and Israeli soldiers retaliated with beatings andbullets.   Half of the money collected on ``Super Sunday'' would go toIsrael. Are American Jews so pained by Israel's actions that theyhave become disaffected with the Jewish state, and unwilling tomake their customary donations?   The answer is no. After the last pledge was counted, fundraisers found they had collected $2.5 million, up $400,000 over the1986 total.   ``Israel is the Jewish homeland, the Jewish heart. No one canlive without a heart. They are rallying around the flag,'' saidLeonard Barrack, general chairman of the Philadelphia AJA.   In city after city, fund raisers have reached the sameconclusion. In Miami, the total collected Jan. 24 was $2.6 million,up $1 million from last year's figures; in Cincinnati it was$360,000, up about $50,000; in Rhode Island it was $187,167, upabout $25,000.   ``Wanting to see your kids work on a kibbutz, wanting to planttrees in Israel, wanting a Jewish state _ these things are notaffected by political events,'' said Steven M. Cohen, a professorof sociology at Queens College and leading Jewish demographer.   But there is no question that many American Jews are anguishedby reports of Israeli soldiers beating Palestinians, burying themalive, shooting them in street warfare reminiscent of Beirut. Andsome have spoken out.   ``As a supporter of Israel ... I am appalled beyond measure bythe treatment of the rioting Palestinians by the Jews,'' wrotefilmmaker Woody Allen, in a recent op-ed piece in The New YorkTimes.   ``I mean, fellas, are you kidding? Beatings of people bysoldiers to make examples of them? Breaking the hands of men andwomen so they can't throw stones? Dragging civilians out of theirhouses at random to smash them with sticks in an effort toterrorize a population into quiet?''   Since early December, stone-throwing Palestinian protesters havechallenged Israel's army, demanding an end to its occupation of theGaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River, territoriesseized by Israel in its wars with the Arabs. More than 50 Arabshave been killed by Israelis in the rioting.   Time magazine polled American Jews last month and found that 57percent opposed the use of force and beatings on Arabs. APalestinian homeland was opposed only by a small margin _ 39percent in favor, 42 percent opposed.   Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun magazine, a self-styled leftistalternative to Commentary that is based in Oakland, Calif.,describes the Israeli occupation as ``immoral and stupid.''   ``We did not survive the gas chambers of Europe in order tobecome the oppressors of Gaza,'' Lerner writes in an upcomingeditorial.   Tikkun has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by calls and lettersfrom American Jews who are outraged by what is happening in theMiddle East, Lerner said. ``There has been unbelievable change,''he says.   ``It used to be that the rule was, `There is no room forcriticism.' Now, the only issue is where do you say it. Do you sayit to the press, or do you say it to your friends?'' the editorsays.   That has been a major issue. Jewish leadership has been divided;some leaders denounce others who have gone public with theircriticism _ those like Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the leader of theReform movement who described the beatings as an ``offense to theJewish spirit.''   ``The criticism by American Jews of Israel _ I've termed itdespicable,'' said Rabbi Avi Weiss, a leader of Americans for aSafe Israel. He deplores those who criticize from ``plush livingrooms in Manhattan.''   ``These are not protesters. These are rioters who are out therewith the intent to maim, to wound and to murder,'' Weiss says.   A Newsday poll of New York Jews found that 47 percent thoughtAmerican Jews should speak out to influence Israel _ and 47 percentfelt they should keep their views to themselves.   Congregants say Rabbi Jehiel Orenstein of Congregation Beth Elof South Orange and Maplewood, N.J., recently took the pulpit todiscuss the creation of a Palestinian state. But when a reporterasked Orenstein to confirm his remarks, the rabbi was evasive.   ``American Jews should not be the critics of Israel becausethey're standing on the front lines and we're at a distance,''Orenstein said.   But Orenstein indicated that he was uneasy with the growinginfluence of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the American-born member of theKnesset who proposes expelling the Arabs from Israel and itsoccupied territories.   And he recounted that when news of the beatings spread, he toldhis congregation, ``It cannot be the policy of Israel to break armsand legs and pull people from their beds and terrorize them.''   Some say Israel does not deserve the infamy that is coming itsway.   ``We cannot give the impression that we're satisfied to havehands broken,'' says Arnold Lasker, a retired rabbi living inMargate, Fla. ``But the breaking of bone, which is a horriblething, has to be seen in context'' _ as a tiny aspect of a decent,democratic Israel.   Many agree that the context is missing _ that the news mediahave distorted events in Israel, either by exaggerating the forceapplied by the Israelis or by neglecting to focus on Arabprovocations.   And there is the question of whether Israel should be held to ahigher standard than other nations. Even Orenstein asks, ``Isanybody asking the United States to give back Texas?''   Elaine W. Charny, a 52-year-old former teacher who lives in thePhiladelphia suburb of Jenkintown, Pa., feels that a higherstandard is justified. ``Israel represents a certain bright hopeand ideal,'' she says.   She says it is the ``moral responsibility'' of Jews around theworld to speak out on Israeli issues; she cringes when she readsthe headlines these days. ``We're all hoping and praying that theycan find a better way of solving this problem,'' she says.   Mrs. Charny and her husband buy Israeli Bonds; they have visitedIsrael three times. However saddened by recent events, Mrs. Charnydoes not envision a day when Israel will lose its appeal.   ``It's an idea,'' she says. ``The idea that it's there for allof us, kind of like a little utopia. It's just a vision.''</TEXT></DOC>
