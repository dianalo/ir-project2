The state news agency Rompres said 10 of the injured were incritical condition after Sunday's accident. It said the accidentapparently was caused by overcrowding due to ``careless merchants''selling their wares on the bridge, which leads to the flea marketin the Transylvanian city of Tirgu Mures.   The crowd reportedly pressed against a railing, causing it tocollapse. In the melee that ensued, the other railing also gaveway, and dozens of people fell into the river Mures 18 feet below.   Rompress said two women died. The report said 26 of the injuredrequired hospitalization. Most suffered broken bones and chestinjuries.   Some newspapers in recent weeks had criticized private tradersin the city, who reportedly acquire goods from state-run shopsillegally and resell them at much higher prices on the black market.   Romania for years has been plagued by widespread consumer andfood shortages.   Tirgu Mures is in central Romania. It was the site of violentclashes between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians that left atleast six dead and hundreds injured in mid-March.</TEXT></DOC>
