Foley today calledPresident Bush's plan to cut the capital gains tax ``a positive harmto the economy'' and vowed to pass a Democratic alternative despitea veto threat.   Bush, meanwhile, denied his policies were designed to help therich and declared: ``This should not be a partisan issue.''   ``I think we're doing very well'' in enlisting support for theDemocratic plan that would raise taxes for the richest 600,000couples and individuals to pay for new tax deductions for IndividualRetirement Accounts, Foley told reporters. ``We have a pretty goodpopular constituency.''   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll seemed to back that up,showing that 49 percent of voters prefer expansion of IRAs, while 38percent favor Bush's capital gains tax reduction idea. The pollnoted that the preference for IRAs was even greater amongmiddle-income voters: 53 percent to 35 percent.   The Democrats' proposal also includes a scaled-down version ofthe capital gains tax cut sought by Bush. Bush's version, Foleysaid, ``is a positive harm to the economy, an inequitable taxreduction favoring the least financially deserving of the incomegroups in the country.''   The president, interviewed live Thursday night on the ABC-TVprogram ``Prime Time Live,'' was asked what he would do if Democratson Capitol Hill succeeded in passing their own tax bill.   ``I will veto a rate increase,'' Bush said. ``You heard it forthe first time here, but I have sent that signal up to the Hill.''   Responding to that, Foley said: ``Well, then, we'll try to sendit to him and let him veto it.''   Bush also defended his proposal for a cut in the capital gainsrate, saying, ``It is not a tax break for the rich.'' The House Waysand Means Committee approved a version of the president's plan.   Taking questions from farm broadcasters today on an AgricultureDepartment radio program, Bush said the capital gains tax cut he isseeking ``would put money in the little guy's pocket.''   ``I've heard some on the hill deride this as just another tax cutfor the rich, but that simply is not the case,'' Bush told his radioaudience.   He claimed that under existing law, only one-third ofsole-proprietor farmers could qualify for a 100 percent exclusionfrom the capital gains tax. Under his measure, he said, half wouldqualify for this exclusion.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Thursday thatDemocrats were ready to tackle the tax hike accusations.   ``I like how the lines are drawn,'' Gephardt said. ``The Bushproposal gives a tax break for the rich, paid for by the middleclass. Our proposal gives Individual Retirement Accounts to themiddle class paid for by the super-wealthy.''   The Democratic proposal, which House leadership plans to bringbefore the full House next week, would:   _Eliminate restrictions passed in 1986 so that all workers,regardless of income, could have a deductible IRA plan. The moneycould be withdrawn before retirement without paying a penalty ifused to finance the down payment on a first home or for collegeeducation.   _Pay for the IRAs and reduce the deficit by raising taxes on thenation's wealthiest 600,000 couples and individuals.   Under current law, the tax rate for upper-middle-income Americansis 33 percent, but it drops back to 28 percent for those at theuppermost income levels. The Democrats would raise that top rate to33 percent.   For example, a single person with $75,000 taxable income now paysa top rate of 33 percent on a $10,000 pay raise or investmentwindfall. But a $250,000-a-year earner pays only 28 percent tax on asimilar increase in income.   _Eliminate the 33 percent rate bracket for capital gains, so itwould never climb above 28 percent. That would be a tax break forthose upper-middle-income people who now pay 33 percent on capitalgains just as they do on earned income.   The Democratic plan would be offered as an alternative to thecapital gains tax cut approved by the House Ways and Means Committeewith the president's support. That plan would cut the effectivecapital gains rate to 19.6 percent for the next two years and thenprotect such income from taxes caused by inflationary increases inthe property's value.</TEXT></DOC>
