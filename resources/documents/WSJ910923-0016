Mr.Derr forecasts only $1.50 for 1992 and $1.70 for thefollowing two years. &quot;Frankly, the only word I can think ofis `lousy,'&quot; Mr. Derr said.   Excessive supplies combined with weak demand havedepressed gas prices since the mid-1980s. Gas demand-andpricesnormally surge in the winter because of cold weather.The rallying cry of gas producers for years has been that oneespecially frigid winter would send prices higher for good.But recent winters have been warmer than normal, depressingdemand and prices in the peak season and leaving lots ofextra gas in storage.   The result is that many companies have stopped banking ongas in the short run. &quot;Our exploration program has shiftedover the last 18 months to focus more on crude oil,&quot; saidJames Dunlap, president of Texaco Inc.'s domestic subsidiary.&quot;Twenty-four months ago it would have been natural gas,&quot; hesaid. Mr. Derr noted that Chevron is producing gas at onlytwo-thirds of capacity.   At this meeting of major oil companies and smaller ones,the talk at times made it seem more like a weatherman'sconvention than an oil to-do. &quot;We just went through thewarmest weather in 60 years,&quot; complained Robert Allison,chairman of Anadarko Petroleum Co.   Punching the air and smiling, C.J. Silas, chairman ofPhillips Petroleum Co., trotted out the old refrain, &quot;We needa really cold winter.&quot; But he isn't counting on it. Mr. Silassaid the weak economy and the not-so-evident recovery couldcurb gas prices for some time.   To withstand continued weak prices, Phillips has targeted$500 million of asset sales. Anadarko has cut back capitalspending in line with its reduced cash flow and isn'tproducing 60% of its gas because it doesn't want to sell attoday's prices. Atlantic Richfield Co. and the Shell Oil Co.unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group have announced large layoffsbecause of weak gas prices, and a host of oil-servicecompanies have also reduced staff.   Major oil companies can weather the slump better becausethey have so many other businesses than the smaller concerns,which tend to rely almost exclusively on gas prices. Whilegas has been depressed, oil prices have hovered above $20 abarrel since the end of the Gulf War, a level of stabilityunseen in years.   Not all small companies are suffering, but usually that'sbecause they've got more oil than gas. Clyde Pomeroy, head ofa small concern with about 300 barrels a day of West Texasoil production, is looking to grow. Mr. Pomeroy said helocked in high prices on the futures market during the GulfWar and wants to funnel the proceeds into more wells. Hesays, &quot;We're looking to expand.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
