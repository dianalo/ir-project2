(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery's astronauts packed todayfor the end of their 1.9 million-mile voyage and prepared theshuttle for a fiery plunge toward a dawn landing Saturday on aCalifornia desert.   Discovery commander Michael L. Coats and pilot John E. Blahaplanned to run through a series of tests today to make sure theshuttle's computers and control jets were ready for the return toEarth.   The other astronauts made final runs on a group of experimentsand followed a script to shoot the last 4,000 feet of film in apowerful 70mm IMAX camera used principally to study the Earth'senvironmental trouble spots. Then they were to stow their equipmentfor the trip home.   All of the crewmen stopped their work for an interview arrangedwith the ``Today'' show on NBC, but then found they had to wait morethan three minutes while the network completed a feature on Texasdove hunting and ran four commercials.   Asked about environmental damage viewed from space, James F.Buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution ``is much moredramatic'' as seen from orbit.   ``What we're trying to do is get some evidence and documentationto bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into theatmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in futuregenerations,'' the astronaut said. ``You can see (it) very, verywell from here.''   Coats said that early in the mission, when an electrical problemforced the astronauts to reduce power usage, ``it wasn't really agreat deal to us.''   ``We powered down a lot of our computer displays. We powered downour lighting as much as possible,'' he said. ``It was a little bitof an inconvenience, but not a real impact on our work.''   Discovery's early bird crew pre-empted the traditional morningmusic from Mission Control in Houston for a third day in a row.   A few minutes before they were to be awakened, the astronautsbeamed to Earth a tape of ``Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It's Off To Work We Go,''the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated movie classic``Snow White.''   Mission Control capsule communicator David Low, referring to theseven dwarfs, responded, ``We can account for Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy,Sneezy and Doc up there. Who wants to sign up to be Bashful andDopey.''   ``I'm not gonna touch that,'' said Coats with a laugh.   The other Discovery astronauts are James F. Buchli, Robert C.Springer, and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.   Early on Saturday, Coats and Blaha will fire two powerful rocketson the back of Discovery to slow the craft and allow it to drop intothe Earth's atmosphere. The shuttle will then make a powerless glidehalfway around the world and land at 6:36 a.m. PST at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif., in the Mojave Desert.   The landing will complete a flight of four days, 23 hours and 38minutes that circled the Earth 79{ times.   If the shuttle lands at the time now scheduled, the mission willhave been about 1{ hours shorter than planned. Discovery waslaunched almost two hours late on Monday, because of weatherconsiderations, and this put the craft in position to land inCalifornia one orbit early.   NASA officials said the forecasts call for good weather atEdwards for the shuttle landing.   Discovery will return to Earth with almost three miles of filmshot with the IMAX camera. The crew captured views of urban sprawl,of pollution patterns in the oceans, and of vast areas in SouthAmerica where the tropical rain forest is being cleared and burned.   The camera also photographed floods in Africa, burned areas ofthe Florida Everglades and western United States, and eruptingvolcanoes in South America and Southeast Asia.   Film from the IMAX will be edited to create a study of theenvironmental wounds inflicted on the Earth by industrial man. It isa joint probject of NASA and the Smithsonian Institution.   The end of Discovery's mission also will be the end for four ratscarried in cages aboard the shuttle. The rats will be killed sotheir skeletons can be studied in an experiment on howweightlessness affects the healing of injured bones. Before launch,small chips were cut from one bone on each rat.   Other experiments on Discovery include comparing the developmentof chicken embryos in space vs. those on Earth; a group of plantsgrown in space to test the effects of weightlessness on root growth;a protein crystal growth study using 19 different proteins; and adevice called the heat pipe, which is a type of cooling system beingtested for use on the space station.   Discovery's primary mission goal was to release the $100 millionTracking and Data Relay Satellite. This was accomplished smoothly onMonday and the satellite later rocketed itself to a stationary orbit22,300 miles over the Atlantic. The satellite completes an orbitingcommunications network for NASA that includes two working TDRS and aspare.   The mission is 28th in the space shuttle and the first of sevenmissions planned this year by NASA. It is also the third shuttlemission since flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger disasterthat killed seven astronauts.</TEXT></DOC>
