These outdoor heat exchangers transfer heat from theenvironment without the use of fans. Heat transfer is multimode and isdue to (a) convection (b) condensation (c) longwave radiation and (d)solar radiation. The development of a mathematical model that predictsthe wind convector heat transfer when there is no frost or rainfall onthe convector surfaces is described. The model is incorporated in a generalsimulation program and validated against experimental tests.</TEXT></DOC>
