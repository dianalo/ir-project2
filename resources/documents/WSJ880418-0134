The statement follows a formal approach made by GEC to join the venture, a Racal spokesman said.    A Racal statement said GEC's inclusion &quot;wouldn't have materially enhanced Orbitel's capabilities&quot; in its primary objective of developing a Pan-European mobile telephone cellular system.    Orbitel was formed in May to design and produce digital radio communications equipment to supply the Pan-European cellular network planned for 1991. Racal and Plessey each hold 50% of Orbitel.    In late trading on London's stock exchange Friday, Racal shares were down two pence (3.8 cents) at 221; Plessey fell two pence to 153; and GEC gained five pence to 155. </TEXT></DOC>
