BussStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a year that has seen Ford Motor Co. enter General Motors Corp.'s league in areas ranging from profits to product appeal, the No. 2 auto maker now measures up to giant GM in yet another category: executive bonuses.    Ford said this week that it set aside a record $167 million for executive bonuses for 1986; in February, GM said it set aside $169 million in bonus funds for last year. The average bonus for each eligible employee at the two companies also will be comparable: about $30,000 at Ford vs. about $34,000 at GM.    However, because Ford outearned GM last year, it is paying out a smaller percentage of its net income in executive bonuses -- 5.1% compared with GM's 5.7%. What's more, while GM's $169 million payout is the maximum its bonus formula allows, Ford said its formula would have allowed a payout of as much as $241.9 million.    The 1986 bonus pool at Ford is 36% larger than the 1985 set-aside of $123 million; GM's bonus set-aside for 1986 declined 23% from the $219 million awarded for 1985. Average individual bonuses at each company will be comparable because, despite being about half GM's size by many measures, Ford has roughly 5,500 employees who are eligible for 1986 bonuses, while GM has about 5,000.    The convergence by the two companies in the area of bonuses is a result of the huge change in their relative profit positions for 1986. As previously reported, Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford earned a record $3.28 billion, or $12.32 a share, up 31% from $2.51 billion, or $9.09 a share, for 1985, while GM's 1986 profit plummeted 26%, to $2.95 billion, or $8.21 a share, from $4 billion, or $12.28 a share, in 1985.    Ford's blue-collar workers earlier this month benefited from that improvement, receiving profit-sharing checks that averaged more than $2,100 each, while GM's hourly workers didn't receive a profit-sharing payout for 1986.    David Scott, Ford's vice president for public affairs, said the Ford board's decision on bonus amounts &quot;was on its own merits. It wasn't relative to anyone else's&quot; bonus awards.    Still, the size of Ford's bonuses for last year drew some criticism. The action is &quot;motivated by greed, not need,&quot; charged Stephen Yokich, a United Auto Workers union vice president, asserting that it isn't justified because Ford is pushing hard for efficiencies and cost savings throughout the corporation.    &quot;Ford's profitability is no excuse for dipping into the till in this fashion,&quot; said Mr. Yokich, who is preparing to negotiate a new, national labor contract with Ford this fall. &quot;For every brilliant decision the executives made in 1986, they made another dumb decision, and this one tops the list.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
