The show began with an interesting theatrical twist. Although Mr. Funaro's departure Sunday from the Finance Ministry had long been expected, it transpired that the president had no idea who to replace him with. Enter a host of characters, mostly from the dominant Brazilian Democratic Movement, or PMDB, headed by party leader Ulysses Guimaraes. They all had pretentions either to be the new minister or to dictate who should have the job.    As the drama unfolded earlier this week, Mr. Guimaraes, a bald and fiery-eyed hero of the long fight to end military rule, came up with a list of at least four names, including his own favorite, Minister for Social Security Raphael de Almeida Magalhaes. But President Sarney was hiding a surprise character behind the arras: a wealthy 37-year-old businessman and state governor named Tasso Jereissati whose chief qualification appeared to be that he came, like the president, from the northeast of Brazil.    Mr. Guimaraes, aged 70, wasn't amused. Given to vehement and unpredictable outbursts, the PMDB leader declared that those who want to know about Mr. Jereissati &quot;should go and ask citizen Jose Sarney. The responsibility is his.&quot; The citizen-president, however, wasn't available for comment and, as night fell, he left the presidential offices and retired to his residence to reflect.    The backdrop to this action is a vast South American nation newly returned to democracy after two decades of military rule, headed by a president who wasn't elected by the people and who came to power only because the designated president died. The country is debating its new constitution -- should it opt for a presidential or parliamentary system? -- and living with 400% annual inflation and a debt moratorium.    It is effectively dominated by a huge and amorphous party -- the PMDB -- that is strong on nationalist and reformist rhetoric but short on government experience and the resources to do anything. The PMDB leader, Mr. Guimaraes, wants to become president, and the president, Mr. Sarney, is widely mistrusted within the party.    Clearly, the two men are wary of each other, but they decided to meet for breakfast. Mr. Guimaraes still had his list, and President Sarney, a man given to wavering, particularly when confronted by the PMDB, had second thoughts about the youthful entrepreneur whom he was championing. The list, which somehow became public knowledge, was reviewed over coffee, and in the end there was agreement, or rather absence of conflict, over an economist from Sao Paulo named Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira.    Mr. Bresser Pereira became finance minister. His appointment, however, was announced to Brazilians not by the president, but by Mr. Guimaraes. The PMDB leader reminded everyone that economic policy, anyway, is the not the business of a minister, but of the party.    Meanwhile, President Sarney summoned the new finance minister to a brief meeting during which he said nothing about policy but made a single request: The new secretary-general of the Finance Ministry should be a man from the northeast.    The cast shambled onward into the gathering gloom with much sniping and carping audible from the back of the stage. Mr. Jereissati, the snubbed candidate, reminded Mr. Guimaraes that choosing a minister should be &quot;the business of the president&quot; and that &quot;the PMDB should not be confused with the personality of Ulysses Guimaraes.&quot; Mr. Magalhaes, the social security minister, muttered that he would have quite liked the finance job, and Mr. Funaro warned everyone he intends to continue &quot;in public life.&quot; Some jesters -- but could they be serious? -- mentioned him as a potential foreign minister.    Amid this confusion, the show continues and the finale remains unpredictable.    But to many, the humiliation of President Sarney that resulted from seeing his choice for finance minister effectively vetoed makes it inevitable that his six-year term, set to end in 1991, will be curtailed.    He has emerged as an indecisive leader casting around desperately -- and mainly in the less-developed northeast -- for support, but without the clout to impose his will or respond effectively to the explosive outbursts of Mr. Guimaraes.    Already, the second-largest political party in the action, the conservative Liberal Front Party, has called this week for direct presidential elections next year. And a leading deputy, Guilherme Afif Domingues, commented that &quot;this week will be remembered in the history of the country as the beginning of the fall of President Jose Sarney.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
