Malfada DiTommaso, accompanied by her daughter VirginiaContanelli and a television news crew, arrived Wednesday fromBuffalo, N.Y., after being told her son's remains had beenrepatriated from Vietnam.   But upon arrival at Honolulu International Airport, the militaryofficials who greeted her said there had been a mistake: her son'smilitary identification card had been returned, but not his remains.   ``This really boggles my mind,'' Mrs. DiTommaso, 75, said. ``TheAir Force blames Hanoi, but I don't see how a mistake like thiscould happen.   ``I wasn't coming here expecting a happy ending, but I wasexpecting my son to finally be home. This is almost too much tohandle.''   Maj. Robert J. DiTommaso was 24 when he and seven fellowcrewmembers were shot down on July 29, 1966, over North Vietnamnear the Laos border. He was declared missing in action for 12years before being classified as ``killed in action, body notfound'' in 1978. The Defense Department said there are still 2,404Americans listed missing in Indochina, 13 years after the UnitedStates pulled out.   For the past 22 years, Mrs. DiTommaso said, she has beensearching for information about her son. She has traveled to Laos,obtained information through the Freedom of Information Act andjoined veterans groups.   ``I'm in limbo. It's a nightmare only a mother couldunderstand,'' she said.   ``It's been a day to day trauma for my mother,'' her daughteradded. ``She's changed from a quiet little housewife to one who'sfighting for her son.''   A thaw in U.S.-Vietnamese relations brought new hope, and Mrs.DiTommaso said she was relieved when she got a call from theCasualty Division of Randolph Air Force Base in Texas that herson's remains were to be returned by Hanoi.   The Pentagon announced last week that the remains of 20 Americanserviceman killed during the Vietnam War were to be repatriated,but that before they were released to the next of kin they would bebrought to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory here forpositive identification.   ``What happened is that Hanoi sent only 17 remains plusinformation on three others,'' said Maj. Virginia Pribyla, mediaofficer for the U.S. Pacific Command. ``They also had a list of 10name associations, which just means the Vietnamese think they knowwho they (the remains) are, but they're not positive.''   DiTommaso was mentioned on that list, Pribyla said, and thatinformation was forwarded to his family, but Mrs. DiTommaso wasclearly told that no positive identification had been completed.   ``We forward all the information we get, but we certainly don'tencourage families to come out here unless identification isabsolute,'' Pribyla said. ``But Mrs. DiTommaso came out when shefirst got word, unfortunately it was just premature.''   ``It was an administrative error. Unfortunately, the informationHanoi forwarded to us turned out not to be right,'' she said.``That's why we wait until getting positive identification from thelab here before officially releasing the names.''   Mrs. DiTommaso said she was especially shocked by the newsbecause a news crew had traveled with her to film her receiving herson's remains.   Her trip was paid for by United Airlines and Buffalo's ABCaffliate, KBW-TV.   ``This isn't the story we were hoping to get, but we'll justwait a while and see what Mrs. DiTommaso wants to do now. I can'tbelieve it ended up this way,'' said reporter Dan Hausley, whoaccompanied her.   Mrs. DiTommaso said she would attend a memorial ceremony todayat Hickam Air Force Base when the remains are flown in.   ``They're still our boys, and I know how their families mustfeel,'' she said.   She said she still holds hope her son is alive, and that somedaythey will be reunited.   ``This is terrible because it leaves me in limbo, but it alsoleaves me with hope,'' she said. ``I know there must be Americansin there that are still alive, maybe Bobby is one of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
