Langdon.</ITAG>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is making two technicalcorrections in part 294 of the Commission's regulations. The Commissionis correcting the title for Part 294 to reflect that these regulationsare final and not interim. The Commission is also deleting the note atthe end of andSection; 294.101 of the regulations which states that the section'sreporting requirements are not subject to OMB approval. The reporting requirementsin the regulations are subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork ReductionAct, and the note therefore is incorrect.On October 5, 1984, the Commission issued a final rule in Order No. 401making these reporting procedures permanent (49 FR 39,536 (Oct. 9, 1984)).The order was submitted to OMB at that time for approval of the reportingrequirements and assignment of an OMB control number. However, the regulatorytext in Order No. 401 failed to either change the title from interim tofinal or delete the note at the end of andSection; 294.101 of the Commission'sregulations. The note was applicable to the interim rule only, and notto the final rule.The technical amendment clarifies that these reporting procedures are permanentand that OMB has reviewed and approved them.These technical corrections are effective September 28, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 18 CFR Part 294</ITAG>Electric utilities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, part 294, chapter I, title 18 of theCode of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
