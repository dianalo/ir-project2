Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from December 30, 1988 through January 12, 1989. The lastbiweekly notice was published on January 11, 1989 (54 FR 1018). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By March 3, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>July 11, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed changes revisethe titles listed in the index section of the Technical Specificationsto be consistent with the titles shown in the text. The changes also revisetwo titles provided in the text for consistency with Technical Specificationsbetween the two units. All changes are considered administrative changesand are described in Enclosure 4 of the request letter. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and has determined the requestedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration for thefollowing reasons: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment is purely administrative in nature and doesnot change the functions or design of any equipment. Its sole purpose isto provide consistency between the text and the indices of the TechnicalSpecifications. Therefore, it does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not change the design or function ofany equipment and has no impact on any accident analyses. The changes arebeing made for consistency only and can clearly be classified as administrative.Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not impact any safety analyses becauseit is purely administrative in nature. No modification or change to equipmentis involved. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's determination and is in agreementwith them. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that thesechanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>August 23, 1988 <T3>Description of amendments: </T3>The proposed amendment would reviseTechnical Specification Table 3.3.5.7-1 to change the type of fire detectioninstruments required for the diesel generator building. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L or the licensee) providedthe following analysis to support the finding that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The fire detection system is designed for detection and mitigationof accidents involving fires but does not affect the probability of thoseaccidents. The proposed change involves the use of a more effective firedetection instrument arrangement based on the fire hazards associated withthe diesel generator cells. The new heat and flame detectors will providean enhanced means of detecting the major fire hazard (a fuel oil fire)expected to result in significant damage to the diesel generators. Thisenhancement will provide equivalent limitations on the consequences ofthis type of fire. Based on this reasoning, CPandamp;L has determined thatthe proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The accidents analyzed in Chapter 15 of the Updated FSAR are notaffected by the proposed change in detector types. The change in detectorswill not affect the fire detection system's ability to perform its intendedfunction. The new flame and heat detectors are more suited for the firehazard involved than the present smoke detectors. Since the fire detectionsystem, including the detection instruments, affect [SIC] only the detectionand subsequent mitigation of a fire, CPandamp;L has determined that the proposedamendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change provides an enhanced capability of detectinga severe fuel oil fire in the diesel generator cells. This type of firehazard was evaluated to have the greatest impact on the continued availabilityof the diesel generators. The new flame and heat detectors are more suitedfor the rapid detection of this type of fire. The present smoke detectorsare better suited for detecting a fire with a long incipient or smolderingstage, which generally involves burning of ordinary combustible materials.It has been determined that this type of fire will not likely result indamage to safety related equipment located in the diesel generator cells.Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG>Based on the above, the licensee has determined that the proposed amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff hasreviewed the licensee's analysis and agrees with the determination. Accordingly,the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington,North Carolina 28403-3297. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R. E. Jones, General Counsel, CarolinaPower andamp; Light Company, P. O.

RobinsonSteam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, Darlington County, South Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>November 30, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The request would amend theTechnical Specifications (TS) to increase the minimum inventory of dieselgenerator fuel at the H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (HBR-2),site. The existing diesel fuel storage capacity is sufficient to meet therequirements of the proposed TS amendment. The proposed TS would correctan inconsistency between the TS and the HBR-2 updated Final Safety AnalysisReport. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the TechnicalSpecifications change request in accordance with the standards set forthin 10 CFR 50.92 and concluded that this change does not constitute a significanthazards consideration based upon the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Operation of the facility, in accordance with the proposed amendment,would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed because increasing the required fueloil inventory increases the length of time the diesels can function beforeresupply is necessary. The change to administratively maintain an increasedminimum fuel oil inventory in the Unit 1 tank does not impact the combustibleloading for the Unit 2 Fire Hazard Analysis. Since no change in plant system'sconfiguration is required to achieve the inventory increases, nor doesany fuel oil storage system contribute to any previously analyzed accidentsequence, the proposed change cannot increase the probability or consequencesof previously analyzed accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated because this change places administrativecontrols on fuel oil inventory. No unanalyzed accidents can result fromthis change. No change in plant system's configuration is required, therefore,no new accident or different kind of accident than previously evaluatedcan be introduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Operation of the facility, in accordance with the proposed amendment,would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety becausethis increase in minimum diesel fuel inventory improves margins of safetyby assuring seven days operation of one diesel at its rated design capacity.Additional fuel oil inventory adds to the margin of safety. This resultsfrom providing sufficient fuel oil to allow the diesels to be operatedto their rated design capacity without limiting operation to only minimumrequired safety features. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed CPandamp;L's evaluation and agrees with its analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposed changedoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Hartsville Memorial Library,Home and Fifth Avenues, Hartsville, South Carolina 29535. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R.

However,the NRC will continue to be notified of licensee organization changes throughother regulatory controls. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.34(b)(6)(i), theapplicant's organizational structure is required to be included in theFinal Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Chapter 13 of the FSAR provides adescription of the station organization and detailed organization chart.Updates to the FSAR are required by 10 CFR 50.71(e) to be submitted annuallyto the NRC. Even though Figures 6.1-1 and 6.1-2 would be deleted from TS,Section 6 of the TS would be revised to require inclusion of these organizationcharts in the CECo QA Topical. Whereupon, Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50,and 10 CFR 50.4(b)(7), will govern any changes made to the organizationas it is described in the Quality Assurance (QA) Program. Finally, it isCECo's normal practice to inform the NRC of organization changes affectingtheir nuclear facilities prior to implementation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) involve a significantincrease in the probability of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. CECo evaluated the proposed TS changes and determined,and the NRC staff agrees that: (1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausedeletion of the organization charts from the TS does not affect plant operation,nor does it involve any physical modification of the plant. Furthermore,the aforementioned administrative and regulatory controls remain in forceto ensure that organizational changes are reviewed by the NRC. (2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposedchange is administrative in nature; and does not physically alter any systemsor components, or the way they are operated. (3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety because CECo through its Quality Assurance programs,and its commitment to maintain only qualified personnel in positions ofresponsibility, and other required controls, assures that safety-relatedoperations will be performed at a high level of competence. Furthermore,this amendment does not change any setpoints or operating parameters. Consequently,removal of organization charts from the Technical Specifications will notaffect the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee'sevaluation related to the proposed changes and concurs with their conclusions.In addition, the associated editorial TS changes proposed by CECo are consideredrepresentative of example (i) in the Commission's guidance (51 FR 7751)for examples of no significant hazards, which is defined as ``purely administrativechange to TS; for example a change to achieve consistency throughout theTechnical Specifications, correction of an error, or change in nomenclature.''Therefore the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendment requestdoes not involve significant hazards considerations based upon a preliminaryreview of the application, the licensee's evaluation of no significanthazards, and NRC guidance. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Public Library of IllinoisValley Community College, Rural Route No. 1, Ogelsby, Illinois 61348. <T3>Attorney to licensee: </T3>Michael I.

(2) TS 3.1.F.1.b.(6) would be modified to require grab sample analysisupon inoperability of either (rather than both) of the radioactivity monitoringsystems required by TS 3.1.F.1.a.(6). (3) The TS 3.1.F Basis, TS page 3.1.F-4, paragraph a, would be revisedto state that the containment air particulate monitor would meet ``therecommended sensitivity guidelines of Regulatory Guide 1.45.'' Paragraph``b'' would be revised to remove the activity levels stated (1E-2 uc/ccand 1E-7 uc/cc). (4) The associated Technical Specification 3.1.F Basis would remove statementsthat the containment air particulate monitor is sensitive to 0.025 gpmto greater than 10 gpm so that an increase in reactor coolant system leakageof 1 gpm would be detectable within one minute after it occurs and thecontainment radiogas monitor is less sensitive than the air particulatemonitor. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposedTechnical Specification change is deemed to involve no significant hazardsconsiderations because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordancewith this change would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a Significant Increase In The Probability of Consequencesof An Accident Previously Evaluated: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to TS 3.1.F (Reactor Coolant System Leakage andLeakage into Containment Free Volume) merely make the Indian Point Unit2 leakage detection system requirements for the containment radioactivitymonitors consistent with those of Regulatory Guide 1.45. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Regulatory Guide has been endorsed by the staff on a genericbasis, and it is now applied to IP-2. The analysis supporting the applicationof Regulatory Guide 1.45 to IP-2 has been provided to the staff in the[Leak Before Break] LBB application submittal on May 23, 1988. It is apparent,therefore, that this change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated,but applies an accepted standard (Regulatory Guide 1.45) to substantiatethe basis of this TS. This TS as written is unnecessarily restrictive anddoes not provide any additional safety benefits. The proposed change tothe LCO action statement, 3.1.F.1.b.(6), imposes additional requirementson containment radioactivity monitors and does not increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The additional changes requested are purely administrative in natureand only change typographical errors, make minor editorial changes forconsistency, repaginate the document and delete pertinent portions of theIP-2 Technical Specification that are no longer effective or have beenpreviously approved for deletion, therefore these changes do not increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident FromAny Accident Previously Evaluated: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The request to amend the TS merely allows conformance to RegulatoryGuide 1.45 and imposes more restrictive requirements on the containmentradioactivity monitors; it does not affect the reliability or the adequacyof the leakage detection system currently at IP-2, nor does it affect thedesign basis as described in the FSAR, in and of itself. The related submittal,which requests authorization for the use of the LBB methodology as specifiedin the final rule, also does not alter the existing plant design, but merelyeliminates the necessity of considering the dynamic effects of Double EndedGuillotine Break (DEGB) on the primary system. Neither [these] TS changesnor the basis for these changes (LBB/Regulatory Guide 1.45) creates thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident, because the designitself is not being changed by this TS. The TS is merely being updatedto include current accepted standards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The additional changes requested are purely administrative in natureand only change typographical errors, make minor editorial changes forconsistency, repaginate the document and delete pertinent portions of theIP-2 Technical Specification that are no longer effective or have beenpreviously approved for deletion, therefore these changes do not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a Significant Reduction in Margin of Safety: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Revising the LCO action and basis for the radioactivity monitors hasa negligible effect on the margins of safety. The purpose of the containmentair particulate monitors is to detect sufficiently small amounts of reactorcoolant leakage to indicate an unacceptable plant condition, e.g., pipecracks or excessive valve or seal leakage. The accepted level of sensitivitysought by the staff is as set forth in Regulatory Guide 1.45, and thisTS change will allow IP-2 to conform to this accepted guidance. The IP-2TS basis as set forth at present is based on optimum instrument function,not safety requirements, and thus is far too restrictive. Changing theTS to conform with Regulatory Guide 1.45 will not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The additional changes requested are purely administrative in natureand only change typographical errors, make minor editorial changes forconsistency, repaginate the document and delete pertinent portions of theIP-2 Technical Specification that are no longer effective or have beenpreviously approved for deletion, therefore these changes do not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis.

These examples include ``(i). A purely administrativechange to technical specifications: for example... correction of an error...''.The proposed change is directly related to this example in that the TechnicalSpecifications currently reference a recirculation mode for the toxic gasevent and recirculation means pressurizing the control room with outsideair. In the toxic gas event, outside air is not permitted in the controlroom and the proper reference should be isolation. In making the changeto the Technical Specification, nothing will change and only the TechnicalSpecification word is corrected. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the change involvesno significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W. Churchill, Esq., Shaw, Pittman,Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N St., NW., Washington, DC 20037 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Jose A. Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Louisiana Power and Light Company, Docket No. 50-382, Waterford SteamElectric Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 23, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldchange the Technical Specifications to incorporate the correct operatingrange for the Containment Area Radiation Monitors and clarify the radiationbackground setpoint for containment purge and exhaust isolation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Technical Specifications list the operating range for the four containmentradiation monitors for isolation of purge and exhaust in the unlikely eventof an accident inside containment. These ranges were derived from the CombustionEngineering Standard Technical Specifications and from Generic Letter 82-16which used counts per minute. The original numbers were proposed for themonitors and the licensee has determined that at the lower end of the rangerequirements (per the Technical Specification), the monitors are not accurateor reliable and would be called inoperable. This places the plant in anunwarranted position in some modes and penalizes operation. The setpointis set at twice background for isolation of purge and exhaust but backgroundat the low end of the range may be below the monitor capability to measure.The monitor reliability and accuracy begins at 20 mR/hr and goes up to5x105 mR/hr. The licensee proposes to incorporate this accurate range inthe Technical Specifications and to isolate purge and exhaust at readingstwice the lowest accurate reading or twice background whichever is thehighest. Exceeding the setpoint will initiate the logic for the ContainmentPurge Isolation Signal (CPIS). CPIS is also initiated by monitors in theexhaust stack which is the referenced operation in the Off-Site Dose CalculationManual (ODCM). The exhaust stack monitors and the ODCM are not changedby the proposed amendment. The licensee has provided an analysis of the hazards consideration of theproposed change. <ITAG tagnum="21">CPIS guards against fuel handling accidents because the inside-the-containmentaccident ranks highest in off-site dose consequences, excepting LOCAs.Large radioactive releases into containment from LOCAs cause a Safety InjectionActuation Signal (SIAS) and Containment Isolation Actuation Signal (CIAS)to protect the public. The maximum differential pressure expected duringaccident conditions dictates the minimum time to isolate the purge butterfly-valves.Raising the operating range of the containment area radiation monitors...does not change the ability of the area radiation monitors (i.e., CPIS)to protect against fuel handling accidents in containment. Further, thechange does not affect the plant stack monitors which also cause CPIS.The probability and consequences of a fuel handling accident remain ascurrently analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The containment radiation area monitoring machines do not change becauseof this request. The ability for them to measure the operating range remainsunchanged. The alarm/trip setpoint still happens at twice the backgroundlevel the machine can detect (i.e., 40 mR/h or higher). The analysis ofthe fuel handling accident without containment isolation meets 10 CFR 100criteria while using an assumed containment air dose rate much larger thanthe new 20 mR/h low range number. The new setpoint does not affect theSIAS and CIAS logics protecting the public during a LOCA. The area radiationmonitor machines remain unchanged by this request so no new or differentfailure modes exist. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Operability of the radiation monitoring channels ensure that:(1) the radiation levels are continually measured in the areas served bythe individual channels; (2) the alarm or automatic action is initiatedwhen the radiation level trip setpoint is exceeded; (3) sufficient informationis available on selected plant parameters to monitor and assess these variablesfollowing an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The new operating range for the containment area monitors retainsthe bases of its specification. The area radiation monitors measure radiationlevels in their locations within the capability of the machines. The monitorsstill ``trip'' upon reaching the licensee determined setpoint. Action Statementsfor Table 3.3-6 ensure sufficient radiation field information exists afteran accident. Regulatory Guide 1.97 requires the lowest containment arearadiation monitor reading to be 0.1 R/h (100 mR/h). Therefore, the newoperability range provides personnel protection no different than beforebecause Waterford used the same machines, plus fulfilling regulatory requirementsfor containment area radiation monitoring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

Since both of these tests involve power reductions,Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee) is proposing to performthese tests at the same interval to minimize power reductions. First, the proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification 4.6,``Periodic Testing'' by extending the specified surveillance testing intervalfor Main Steam Excess Flow Check Valves from once every six weeks to onceevery three months. Main Steam Excess Flow Check Valves (EFCVs), designed to limit an excessivereactor coolant system cooldown rate and resultant reactivity insertionfollowing a main steam break incident, are tested to ensure that the valvesare not mechanically prevented from closing when needed. Second, the proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification 4.2,``Equipment and Sampling Tests,'' by extending the surveillance requirementsfor turbine stop, governor, reheater and intercept valves, from once permonth to once per three months, consistent with the proposed interval forthe EFCVs. Turbine valves are periodically tested to ensure they are operable andare designed to protect the turbine from excessive overspeed. An evaluationof turbine overspeed and missile generation probability considering turbinevalve test interval has been performed by the licensee. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration: </T3>The proposedchanges to the Technical Specifications have been evaluated by the licenseeto determine whether they constitute a significant hazards considerationas required by 10 CFR Part 50, Section 50.91 using standards provided inSection 50.92. That analysis is provided below: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change is expected to have an insignificant impact onplant and public safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After 15 years of operation and approximately 225 Main Steam ExcessFlow Check Valve partial stroke tests, the licensee has never had a valvefail to stroke as required. Furthermore, the mechanical binding checkedfor in this test is one potential failure mechanism of the valve. Changingfrom a six week to a three month test interval is expected to have littleor no impact on the probability of finding a mechanically stuck EFCV duringa test and will have no effect at all on any of the other potential failuremechanisms. In other words, this change is expected to have a small effecton a fraction of the valves' total failure probability. Therefore, theproposed amendment to increase the Main Steam Excess Flow Check Valve partialstroke test interval does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An analysis as reported in the Westinghouse report, WCAP-11525 providesan evaluation of the probability of turbine missile ejection for the purposeof justifying a reduction in the frequency of turbine valve testing. Ina letter to Westinghouse Electric Corporation dated February 2, 1987 (C.E. Rossi, USNRC to J. A. Martin, Westinghouse), the Commission establishedacceptable criteria for the probability of generating a turbine missilefrom the unfavorably oriented turbine (acceptable probability of missilegeneration is less than 1.0 x 10-5). The licensee's evaluation in WCAP-11525shows that the probability of a missile ejection incident for turbine valvetest intervals of up to one year is significantly less than the establishedacceptance criteria. The small change in the probability of generatinga turbine missile with longer turbine valve testing intervals does notrepresent a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment changes the frequency at which Turbine Valvesand Main Steam Excess Flow Check Valves are tested. Changing the frequencyof testing does not result in a change in the failure modes of the TurbineValves or Excess Flow Check Valves. Therefore, the proposed amendment doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted in 1 above, this change to the Maine Yankee Technical Specificationwill not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety forMain Steam Excess Flow Check Valve failure. The increased test intervalwill have a small impact on just one contributor to the overall ExcessFlow Check Valve failure probability. Furthermore, the overall effect willbe an increase in the plant's margin of safety due to fewer test-inducedplant transients and reduced valve unavailability due to testing. The probabilityof Maine Steam Excess Flow Check Valve failure remains acceptably smalland the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction inthe margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted above, and as shown in WCAP-11525, this change to the MaineYankee Technical Specification will not result in a significant reductionin the margin of safety for missile ejection. The probability of missileejection remains acceptably small and within guidelines established bythe NRC Staff. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standard in 10 CFR 50.92 for determining whether a significant hazardsconsideration exists by providing certain examples of amendments that willlikely be found to involve no significant hazards considerations. The changesto the Maine Yankee Technical Specifications proposed in this amendmentrequest are similar to NRC examples (iv) and (vi). Example (iv) relatesto the granting of a relief from an operating restriction upon demonstrationof acceptable means of operation. This assumes that acceptable operatingcriteria have been established and that it is satisfactorily shown thatthe criteria have been met. Example (vi) relates to a change which eithermay result in some increase to the probability or consequences of a previouslyanalyzed accident or may reduce in some way a margin of safety, but wherethe results of the change are clearly within all transient analysis acceptancecriteria and within the limits of 10 CFR Part 50.46 and Appendix K to Part50. The Commission has established an acceptance criteria for the turbinemissile ejection accident of 1.0E-5. The probability of a turbine missileejection incident presented in WCAP-11525 ranges from 3.98E-6 with a turbinevalve inspection interval of one month to 9.21E-6 with a turbine valveinspection interval of one year. This demonstrates that the probabilityof a turbine missile ejection accident for the Maine Yankee plant is wellwithin accepted NRC criteria. </ITAG>Based on this guidance and the reasons discussed above, the licensee hasconcluded that the proposed change does not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. The Commission agrees with this conclusion. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Wiscasset Public Library,High Street, P. O.

Of the 217 assembliescurrently residing in the Maine Yankee core, 208 are fabricated by CombustionEngineering and nine (9) are fabricated by Advanced Nuclear Fuels (Exxon).All fuel assemblies used in the Cycle 11 core are not significantly differentfrom those previously used at Maine Yankee. As in previous reload coresat Maine Yankee and other facilities, the NRC found the fuel design tobe acceptable. The Control Element Assembly (CEA) pattern for Cycle 11operation at 2700 MWth is identical to that used in both Cycle 10 and the2630 MWth operation of Cycle 11. Also, the thermal, thermal-hydraulic,and physics characteristics for Cycle 11 2700 MWth operation are not significantlydifferent from those of Cycle 11 at 2630 MWth operation. Therefore, theseproposed changes which support the operation of Maine Yankee for Cycle11 at a power level of 2700 MWth do not increase the probability of anaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Cycle 11 design at 2700 MWth operation has been evaluated to demonstratethe acceptability of events previously evaluated in the Maine Yankee FinalSafety Analysis Report (FSAR).

These new TS are proposed for an alternate decay heat removalsystem (ADHRS) to be installed for use during refueling outages when theresidual heat removal (RHR) system is out of service for maintenance orinspection. The proposed ADHRS would use plant service water (PSW) in theADHRS heat exchangers to remove decay heat from reactor cooling water.The service water radiation monitor would detect heat exchanger tube leakage.The ADHRS would consist of two pumps and two heat exchangers in parallelwith a common suction line connected to the existing RHR suction line anda common discharge line connected to one of the low pressure coolant injection(LPCI) lines. The two valves added to TS 3/4.8.4.2 would be used to isolatethe ADHRS from the RHR and the LPCI lines during plant operation. The ADHRSwould not be a safety related system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee's analysis of the proposed amendment against the three standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 is reproduced below. <ITAG tagnum="21">I. These changes would not significantly increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The ADHRS (including operating requirements) has been found notto significantly increase the probability of previously evaluated accidentsand events as discussed below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nature of the ADHRS and its interconnections with existing plantsystems results in specific consideration of the following events for possibleincreases in probability: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Pipe break or leak </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Loss of coolant accident (LOCA)/inadvertent reactor vessel drainage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Internally generated missiles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) overpressure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Fire </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Loss of electrical power </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Offsite radioactive release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other events/accidents are excluded from detailed consideration becausethere are not identified functional (physical connections or controls interface)relationships and because the ADHRS has been designed to preclude any adversespatial or environmental interactions. Examples of such events includesecondary plant transients, loss of instrument air, reactivity controlfailures, and fuel handling accidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pipe Break or Leak </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS will not significantly increase the probability of a pipebreak or leak in existing systems, and the probability of failure of theADHRS fluid components is no greater than existing systems, as presentlyanalysed [SIC] in UFSAR Section 3.6. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The design of the ADHRS is such that stress loadings due to the attachmentof ADHRS piping equipment to existing plant fluid systems does not causeapplicable stress allowables on existing components to be exceeded. Thisis documented by calculations that employed methodologies, assumptions,loading combinations, and other criteria the same or equivalent to thosecontained in UFSAR Section 3.9. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Evaluated were mechanical loadings imposed by the ADHRS, changes inthe design pressure and temperature of existing piping, and fatigue considerations.Attachment loadings were evaluated at the suction and discharge connectionsof the ADHRS to the RHR and PSW systems, at valves E12F066A and B due tothe addition of motor operators to these valves, loads imposed by the newvalve added to the vertical leg of the RHR suction line from the spentfuel pool, and at locations where lead wrap pipe shielding was added. Existingpiping and supports were verified to be adequate or supports are to bemodified and/or new supports added as applicable to achieve acceptableconditions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The added ADHRS piping handling reactor coolant is designated as safety-related,ASME Section III, Class 2 and Class 3, and Seismic Category I. In addition,PSW piping inside the RHR ``C'' pump room and up to the isolation valvesat the existing supply and return headers and air handling unit is designatedas safety-related, ASME Section III, Class 3, and Seismic Category I. Otherpiping is B31.1 and designed for SSE loads. The design and analysis ofthis piping is to the same standards, criteria, and methodology as existingplant piping. Damage to the ADHRS piping and components due to over-pressureis prevented by design of the system for the highest pressure possiblefrom ADHRS operation (pump shutoff head plus maximum static head at thepump suction), and providing for system isolation from higher pressuresources (i.e., RHR ``C'' pump discharge). The portion of the system thatcannot be isolated from RHR ``C'' (downstream of the ADHRS isolation valves)is designed for RHR ``C'' design pressure. Thermal relief valves are providedin the ADHRS for overpressure protection when the system is isolated andfor minor leakage that may occur across the boundary valves. Adequate ventsand drains are included in the design to provide for complete filling andventing prior to pump start. This provision will preclude the possibilityof a waterhammer event during startup of the system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Materials (mostly carbon steel) used in the ADHRS pressure boundaryare compatible with those used in connected systems and will not inducea degradation of existing piping. The ADHRS does not employ any stainlesssteel pressure boundary components other than instrument connections. Reactorcoolant chemistry is controlled to prevent failure of stainless steel componentsdue to intergranular stress corrosion cracking. On the reactor coolantside of the ADHRS, no features are provided that would alter reactor coolantchemistry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Erosion of existing and new piping is not expected to occur basedon flow velocities and expected usage times. Specified nominal corrosionallowances for new piping are the same as for existing piping, and excessivecorrosion during lengthy inactive periods is to be precluded by wet layupof the reactor water side (the same as currently performed for the existingRHR system), and layup of the PSW side. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Adequate protection from overpressurization of piping is providedby the inclusion of appropriate isolation capability at system interfaces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consequently, the ADHRS modification does not significantly increasethe probability of a break in existing piping and the probability of abreak in the new piping is no higher than in existing piping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">LOCA/Inadvertent Vessel Drainage </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such events as a consequence of the presence or use of the ADHRS canonly occur during operational conditions 4 or 5 (cold shutdown or refueling),since in all other operational conditions the ADHRS is required to be physicallyisolated from other systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The probability of a pipe break outside containment is not significantlyincreased by the addition of the ADHRS. Per UFSAR Section 3.6, postulatinga pipe failure when the ADHRS is aligned or operating is not required.Specifically, UFSAR Section 3.6A.1.1c states that ``Pipe breaks or crackswere postulated to occur during normal plant operation (i.e., reactor startup,operation at power, hot standby or reactor cooldown to cold shutdown).''These conditions do not apply to operational conditions 4 or 5 when theADHRS would be in operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To the extent that the criteria cited in Section 3.6 implicitly assumeadequate piping design, the ADHRS satisfies this assumption. As for a pipebreak inside containment, the only piping involved is the RHR ``C'' LPCIinjection line to the reactor vessel. This line was evaluated for an increasedfatigue usage factor arising from a longer operating time for this pipe(albeit at a lower flow rate) due to ADHRS operation and determined toremain within code limits. Therefore, addition of the ADHRS will not significantlyincrease the probability of failure of this pipe. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Relative to a LOCA caused by inadvertent drainage of the reactor vessel(i.e., a system alignment that allows either gravity or pumped flow fromthe vessel via an existing isolation point), the ADHRS design and its accompanyingprocedural requirements make this a no more probable event than that associatedwith existing plant systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The probability of a LOCA type event is not significantly increasedby the addition of the ADHRS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Internally Generated Missiles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS does not pose any additional hazards in this regard as asource of missiles. The ADHRS is not postulated to be a source of pressurizedcomponent missiles, and potential rotating component missiles (from thepumps and air handling unit fan) are also not required to be postulated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary Overpressure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When in operation, the ADHRS pumps reactor coolant to the reactorvessel. The only time when ADHRS could be operated that reactor pressurecould potentially increase is in operational condition 4 with the reactorvessel head installed. However, the maximum discharge pressure of the ADHRSis well below reactor vessel design pressure. The ADHRS otherwise willnot interfere with vessel overpressure protection functions so that theprobability of an event of this kind is not increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fire </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS does not involve the addition of any combustible loadingin excess of that assumed in the FHA to the areas in which it is locatedas contained in the GGNS Fire Hazards Analysis Report and thus does notcontribute to the increased probability of a fire. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Loss of Electrical Power </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The only Class 1E electrical loads involved with the ADHRS designare the motor operators for valves E12F066A and B. These power suppliesare designed in accordance with the various Class 1E criteria describedin UFSAR Section 8. The power supplies to these motors are adequate forthe additional loading. Thus, there is no additional potential for lossof Class 1E power. The added non-Class 1E loads have been designed to standardsconsistent with the existing design for the type of load. Therefore, tothe extent that loss of non-Class 1E power might initiate a plant transient,no greater probability is indicated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Offsite Radioactive Release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS design provides a boundary, within the ADHRS heat exchangers,between radioactively contaminated reactor coolant and the PSW system whichcan discharge to the environment. The boundary (heat exchanger tubes) isdesigned and constructed to ASME Section III, Class 3 standards and toSeismic Category I criteria. As such the probability of its failure isno greater than other plant systems containing radioactive fluids. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inadvertent Operation of RHR Shutdown Cooling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This event is discussed in UFSAR Section 15.1.6 and relates to a slowdecrease in moderator temperature leading to an increase in reactor power,when the reactor is critical or near critical. The only cause for thisevent cited in the UFSAR is misoperation of the cooling water controlsfor the RHR heat exchanger. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inasmuch as the cooling water controls for the ADHRS are no more proneto failure than those of the RHR (both are manually operated with no automaticactivation or automatic control), and there would be no reason for greateroperator error, the ADHRS would not significantly increase the probabilityof this event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The ADHRS design (including operating requirements) does not significantlyincrease the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the UFSARas discussed below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The assessment relative to consequences results in specific considerationof the following events for significant increases in consequences. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o External high wind/tornado, tornado missile, and flooding events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Seismic events </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Pipe break or leak </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Internally generated missiles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o LOCA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Hydrodynamic events </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Loss of electrical power or instrument air </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Fire </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Offsite radioactive release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other events/accidents are excluded from detailed consideration sincethere are no identified functional interactions or spatial/environmentalinteractions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">External high wind/tornado missile and flooding </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Components added and employed by the ADHRS are completely housed withinexisting safety-related portions of the plant (Auxiliary Building) andas such are not subject to damage or other consequences of these extremeenvironmental effects which are discussed in UFSAR Sections 3.3, 3.4 and3.5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Seismic Events </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS and its components (including existing plant equipment usedfor the ADHRS) are designed or analyzed for safe shutdown earthquake (SSE)design basis loads in order to preserve the pressure integrity of safety-relatedcomponents, the operability of the motor operators and conduit for valvesE12F066A and B, and to ensure that non-safety related components of theADHRS do not pose a hazard to safety-related plant components during aseismic event. Existing components connected to the ADHRS have been re-evaluatedfor the new attachment loadings. This re-evaluation also includes assuranceof continued operability of any affected active safety-related components(e.g., motor operated valves) during or after the seismic event as maybe required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The structural integrity of the Auxiliary Building due to loads imposedby the ADHRS is adequate. The major ADHRS components are located on thebuilding basement at El. 93', and there is no appreciable effect on structuralseismic response. Loads imposed on walls, beams, or other structural elementsin the ADHRS design are acceptable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pipe Break/Leak </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS does not present hazards (pipe whip, jet impingement, etc.)from high energy line breaks (HELB) and is not subject to damage from HELBsin other plant systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS safety functions are not impacted by spray or flooding frommoderate energy pipe cracks in other plant systems (no such events arerequired to be postulated during operational conditions 4 and 5 when theADHRS is in operation). The ADHRS also does not pose a hazard to othersafety-related plant components due to spray effects of a pipe crack. Existingdrainage and detection capabilities are adequate for any flooding thatmay be involved in the event of an ADHRS line crack or break. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the addition of the ADHRS does not significantly increasethe consequences of pipe break as discussed in UFSAR Section 3.6. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Internally Generated Missiles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The potential for damage to the ADHRS, and therefore increased accidentconsequences due to internally generated missiles (valve stems, rotatingequipment, etc.) or turbine missiles has been assessed in accordance withUFSAR Sections 3.5.1.3 and 3.5.1.4. No additional consequences were determinedto occur. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">LOCA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Postulations concerning a LOCA in reactor operational conditions 4and 5 are not contained in the UFSAR, and such an event is not analyzed(UFSAR Sections 6.2 and 15.6 deal with the design basis LOCA occurringduring reactor operation). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, to the extent that the ADHRS could either interfere withthe mitigation of such an event or be the cause of the event, no increasedconsequences have been identified. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The controls interaction and system interaction evaluation completedfor the ADHRS indicate that no interference by the ADHRS in emergency corecooling system (ECCS) functions or vessel level detection functions wouldoccur. Protection against inadvertent drainage during operation of ADHRSis equivalent to that provided for existing plant systems through the useof interlocks and restricting operating procedures. Additionally, a failureof the ADHRS (i.e., a moderate energy pipe crack) is not required to bepostulated during times when it is conveying reactor coolant (UFSAR Section3.6A.1.1.C). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the above basis, the ADHRS modification would not significantlyincrease the consequences of a LOCA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrodynamic Load Events </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such events include LOCAs (UFSAR Section 15.6), inadvertent SRV opening(UFSAR 15.1.4), and safety-relief valve operation incident to other transientsor accidents. While the ADHRS would not be in operation during such events(as there is no reactor pressure source in operational conditions 4 or5), it is nevertheless designed for such loads. Also connecting equipmentwas reanalyzed to the extend that these loads may be transmitted to theADHRS, to ensure that the ADHRS would not be a hazard and thereby increasethe consequences of such events. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Loss of Electrical Power or Instrument Air </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS has no safety-related function relevant to the loss of ACpower as discussed in UFSAR Section 15.2.6 or instrument air as discussedin UFSAR Section 15.2.10 and no reliance on electrical power or instrumentair is made by ADHRS for other plant events or accidents to ensure thatconsequences are not increased beyond those already evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fire </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The existing fire detection and suppression equipment is adequatefor any potential fire originating within the ADHRS or incident to itspresence. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other than the motor-operators for valves E12F066A and B, and associatedpower and control cable, the interlock for valve E12F004C, and the pumpstart permissive bypass switches for valves E12F066A and B no other safety-relatedcomponents are susceptible to damage by fire. To the extent that the functionalcapability of the E12F066A or B operators may be lost due to a fire, noincrease in accident consequences is indicated. This is because the eventsfor which they are provided (e.g., LOCAs) are not postulated to occur coincidentwith a fire, as indicated in the GGNS Fire Hazards Analysis Report and10 CFR Part 50 Appendix R. The isolation function of the valves is onlyrequired during operational conditions 4 and 5. As such the ability tobring the plant to a cold shutdown condition in the event of a fire isunaffected by their operability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fire-induced failure of the added interlock between valve E12F004Cand RHR ``C'' pump may prevent the RHR ``C'' pump from starting. This isnot a concern, however, as the RHR ``C'' train is not required for safeshutdown of the plant incident to a fire (it provides a LPCI function onlyin mitigation of a LOCA). Failure of the added RHR ``A'' and/or ``B'' pumpstart permissive bypass switches for valves E12F066A and B due to a firemay prevent the RHR ``A'' and/or ``B'' pump from operating with suctionfrom the spent fuel pool. This is also not a concern since the associatedspent fuel pool cooling assist mode of operation of the RHR system is notrequired for safe shutdown of the plant incident to a fire. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The installation requirements for the ADHRS preserve the integrityof fire barriers and penetration seals so existing plant fire containmentfeatures are unaffected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the basis of the above, no significantly increased consequencesof a fire are indicated by installation of the ADHRS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Offsite Radioactive Release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The potential consequences of an offsite release of radioactivelycontaminated water due to an ADHRS heat exchanger tube failure have beenshown to be within regulatory guidelines and limits and less than comparableevents evaluated in the UFSAR, Section 15.7.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inadvertent Operation of RHR Shutdown Cooling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed in UFSAR Section 15.1.6, the effect of inadvertent operationof RHR is to slowly decrease reactor coolant temperature. Since the heatremoval capacity of the RHR system is greater than that of ADHRS, the ADHRScannot produce a greater effect. The mitigation of the event is a highneutron flux reactor scram, which would be unaffected by the installationor use of the ADHRS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The function of the PSW discharge line radiation monitor is todetect substantial intersystem leakage of reactor coolant into the PSWsystem. This monitor and its associated alarm performs no automatic accidentmitigation function or safety-related function. The PSW radiation monitoris not required to function in order to prevent accidental offsite dosesfrom being exceeded. The design and installation of the PSW radiation monitorwill be done in accordance with appropriate codes and standards to ensurethat interfacing system requirements are not compromised. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Currently, valves E12F066A and B perform no accident mitigationfunction and are not required to open or close in order to bring the plantto cold shutdown conditions. The function of the two new motor operatedvalve thermal overload protection devices is to protect the motor operatorsunder overload conditions. These motor operators perform no automatic orremote-manual accident mitigation function. The failure of the motor operatorswill have no functional effect on ECCS system operation. The ECCS systemis capable of delivering required system flow rates with E12F066A and Bfailed in the open position. The failure of the motor operator to closeor to be closed would prevent the establishment of an ASME Section IIIClass 2 pressure boundary for ECCS. However, the ECCS system has been evaluatedwith the failure of these valves in the open position and was found tobe capable of continuing to deliver the required ECCS system flow rates.In addition, the piping beyond valves E12F066A and B is designed for processconditions that would occur in the LPCI mode. The only function of themotor operators is to allow remote-manual operation of the valves fromthe control room. The addition of the motor operators and the thermal overloaddevices will not change or affect the valves' present function or performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the addition of the ADHRS and its associated PSW radiationmonitor and thermal overload devices for valves E12F066A and B would notsignificantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">II. These changes would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Based on the functional interactions of the ADHRS, the followingpotential events have been evaluated with respect to the creation of anew or different type of accident from any previously evaluated: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Loss of fuel pool cooling/fuel pool water inventory </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">o Offsite radioactive release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Loss of Fuel Pool Cooling/Fuel Pool Water Inventory </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS can be connected to the spent fuel pool either in a flush/fillmode or as a suction source for cooling when the reactor cavity/upper containmentpool is filled. The ADHRS is not specifically designed for or otherwiseexpected to assume heat loads imposed by the spent fuel pool. Additionally,the loss or failure of the ADHRS cannot prevent the RHR system from operatingin the fuel pool cooling mode. Thus, loss of the ADHRS cannot involve aloss of spent fuel pool cooling. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The operation of the ADHRS with suction on the spent fuel pool willnot cause a loss of spent fuel pool cooling system, as described in UFSARSection 9.1. There are no mechanical, controls, or electrical interconnectionsbetween the two systems and hydraulic-type effects have been evaluatedand concluded to be non-interfering. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When connected to the spent fuel pool there is potential for leakagefrom the pool due to a failure in ADHRS piping. This piping is designedand qualified per the applicable criteria including new operating conditionsfor existing piping and is no more susceptible to a break or leak thanexisting piping. The potential for inadvertently draining the spent fuelpool when the ADHRS is taking suction from it has been evaluated. The ADHRSuses an existing suction point on the spent fuel pool. As explained inUFSAR Section 9.1, all connections to the pool are designed to precludedrainage below a level sufficient for adequate shielding. The ADHRS useof this existing line would not interfere with this feature. Hydraulicoperation effects that could lower the spent fuel pool level have beenevaluated and found not to present a potential hazard relative to the shieldingfunction of the fuel pool inventory. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The drainage potential and hydraulic effects of ADHRS operation onthe spent fuel pool are consistent with those existing when operating theRHR system in the fuel pool cooling assist mode. Since the ADHRS configurationoffers no less protection in this regard, it is concluded that a new ordifferent accident type is not created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Offsite Radioactive Release </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADHRS design provides a boundary, within the ADHRS heat exchangers,between radioactively contaminated reactor coolant and the PSW system whichcan discharge to the environment. The boundary (heat exchanger tubes) isdesigned and constructed to ASME Section III and Seismic Category I requirements.As such the probability of an ADHRS boundary failure is no greater thanother plant systems containing radioactive fluids (e.g. FPCCU, RWCU, orradwaste tanks). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The GGNS UFSAR Section 15.7.2 addresses a postulated unexpected anduncontrolled release of radioactivity due to a radioactive liquid wastesystem failure. The postulated gross failure of the ADHRS pressure boundaryand the UFSAR Section 15.7.2 event are considered similar kinds of accidentsin that both are unexpected and uncontrolled releases of radioactive materialto the offsite boundary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The PSW radiation monitor will perform no automatic accident mitigationfunction and will initiate no safety-related or nonsafety-related systems.The function of the radiation monitor is to detect substantial intersystemleakage of reactor coolant into the PSW system. The design and installationof the PSW radiation monitor will be done in accordance with appropriatecodes and standards to ensure interfacing system requirements are not compromised.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The addition of the motor operators and the thermal overload protectiondevices on valves E12F066A and B does not change the valves [SIC] originalfunction. These valves will continue to perform no safety-related functionother than serving as system code boundary classification break. The failureof E12F066A or B to close or to be closed by the operator defeats the establishmentof an ASME Section III Class 2 pressure boundary for ECCS as recommendedin Regulatory Guide 1.29 and committed to in UFSAR Section 3.2. However,this failure has no functional effect on the operation of ECCS. The ECCSsystems have been evaluated with the failure of these valves in the openposition and was [SIC] found to be capable of continuing to deliver therequired ECCS flow rates. In addition, the piping beyond these valves issafety-related (Class 3), Seismic Category I and designed for the processconditions that would occur in the LPCI mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the addition of the ADHRS and its associated PSW radiationmonitor and thermal overload devices for valves E12F066A and B would notcreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">III. These changes would not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The ADHRS provides an improved alternate method of decay heatremoval and coolant mixing as required by the bases for Technical Specification3/4.4.9. Since the ADHRS is specifically designed to maintain the averagereactor coolant temperature less than or equal to 200anddegrees; F in coldshutdown and less than or equal to 140anddegrees; F in refueling, the marginof safety to fulfill the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.4.9and Table 1.2 is maintained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The ADHRS is designed and constructed to ASME Section III, Class2 and Class 3 standards and to Seismic Category I criteria. As such, themargin of safety this system provides is equal to or greater than othercomparable plant systems containing radioactive fluids (e.g. FPCCU, RWCU,etc.). The ADHRS and its associated PSW radiation monitor will have nodirect or indirect impact on existing safety-related or nonsafety-relatedsystems and thus will not affect operation of any equipment required tomitigate an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The addition of the motor operators and associated thermal overloadprotection devices to valves E12F066A and B will not affect the operationor intended function of these valves. As previously noted, these valvesperform no accident mitigation function. The current function of thesevalves is to align RHR ``A'' or ``B'' loops in the spent fuel pool coolingassist modes and to serve as code boundary classification breaks betweenASME Section III Class 2 and Class 3 piping. The failure of these valveactuators will have no functional effect on the ECCS system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the addition of the ADHRS and its associated PSW radiationmonitor and thermal overload devices for valves E12F066A and B would notinvolve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The licensee's analysis of theproposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. No significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated results from this change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The accident previously evaluated is a Fuel Handling Accident.The probability of a Fuel Handling Accident is not significantly increasedbecause the components being lifted would be lifted by the monorail auxiliaryhoist if there were not an auxiliary hoist. The auxiliary hoist is designed,manufactured and installed with the same appropriate criteria as the monorailauxiliary hoist. Additionally the auxiliary hoist for the FHP [fuel handlingplatform] is the same design, manufacture and installation as the auxiliaryhoist on the [refueling platform] RP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The consequences of a fuel handling accident are not increaseddue to the fact that no new loads or lifting heights are introduced withthe addition of the auxiliary hoist on the FHP. Additionally the Fuel HandlingAccident fuel damage bounds the scenario of a load dropping from the auxiliaryhoist on the FHP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The proposed changes in the Surveillance Requirements provide clarificationto allow performance of the appropriate surveillance on the correct hoist.Thus there is not a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated involved in this change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously, evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The fuel handling accident is the only accident possible. The fuelhandling accident has been previously evaluated and bounds the fuel damageresulting from a load drop from the auxiliary hoist on the FHP. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The RP currently has an auxiliary hoist of the same manufacture,design and installation. The FHP auxiliary hoist will not move spent fuelor new fuel. The RP and FHP auxiliary hoist load is limited to less thanthe load used in the fuel handling accident and the load lift height islimited to the height of the lift allowed for the RP auxiliary hoist. Theload drop from the auxiliary hoist of the FHP is bounded in fuel damageby the Fuel Handling Accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The proposed changes in the Surveillance Requirements will ensurethat the correct hoist has the appropriate surveillance performed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d.

The design, manufacture, installation, load limits, up travel hoistlimit, fuel handling exclusion and applicable interlocks define the marginof safety for the auxiliary hoist on the Fuel Handling platform. Sincethe FHP auxiliary hoist and the RP auxiliary hoist are not significantlydifferent in these respects this change does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The proposed change ensures that the appropriate surveillance isperformed on the correct hoist. This will verify that the redundant loadlimits for both the auxiliary hoists on the FHP and the load override switchon the monorail auxiliary hoist are operable and are in the correct position.</ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The licensee has determined and the NRC staff agrees that the proposedamendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofany accident previously evaluated. The impact of the change on design basisaccidents (DBAs) which assume loss of off-site power has been reviewedby the licensee and has been determined to be unaffected by the change.The proposed changes, in general, provide for more conservatism in thatthe operability requirements for the on-site emergency buses and theirassociated control circuits are more restrictive than the existing requirements.These changes to the Technical Specifications do not impact the failureprobability of the associated electrical system, rather they increase theprobability that a train of emergency electrical power is available followingan accident. The probability of occurrence or the consequences of the DBAsare unchanged. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. There are no new failure modes associated with theproposed changes since they involve more restrictive requirements on theoperability of the electrical power systems. No new accident is createdbecause the same equipment is assumed to perform in the same manner asbefore. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The protectiveboundaries are not impacted because the consequences of the DBA are notaffected. Since the protective boundaries are not affected, the safetylimits are also not affected. The proposed change maintains the basis ofthe Technical Specifications in assuring electrical power operability.The existing 345 KV loss of normal power (LNP) sensing inputs are not inthe Technical Specifications. Technical Specification for the new 4160volt bus undervoltage/timing relay input circuits will be added. The existingTechnical Specification for the bus voltage permissive and the LNP actuationcircuits are being modified to provide additional detail and clarification.Accordingly, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationfor amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Waterford Public Library,49 Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseeaddressed the above three standards in the amendment application. With regard to the three standards, the licensee states that operationof the facility in accordance with this amendment would not: (a) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. This change decreases the consequencesof a loss of coolant accident or main steam line break event with concurrentloss of off-site power and failure of a diesel generator by ensuring thatthe closed cooling water heat exchangers have sufficient heat removal capacityto maintain the containment below the design basis maximum pressure. (b) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. This change does not propose new ordifferent modes of operation for the plant. The continued use of the sameTechnical Specification administrative controls prevents the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident. (c) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This changeincreases the minimum operability requirements of the raw water and containmentcooling system and, therefore, will not cause any reduction in the marginof safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the analysis. In addition, the Commissionhas provided guidance concerning the application of the standards for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists by providing examples(51 FR 7751) of amendments that are considered not likely to involve significanthazards consideration. The proposed change to minimum operating requirementsfor the raw water pumps is an additional restriction to the allowable minimumrequirements presently in the Technical Specifications and is, thus, similarto the example of changes which constitute an additional limitation, restriction,or control not presently included in the technical specifications.

The proposed changes represent the recommendations ofthe diesel generator manufacturer and are consistent with the appropriaterecommendations provided in the Commission's Generic Letter 84-15, ``ProposedStaff Actions to Improve and Maintain Diesel Generator Reliability'', datedJuly 2, 1984. The proposed changes will improve the reliability of theEDGs and reduce the risk from possible station blackout. Generic Letter 84-15 discussed the need to assure that the reliabilityof the EDGs is maintained at an acceptable level. This would be accomplishedin part by reducing the number of ``cold fast starts'' or demonstratingstarting capabilities from ambient conditions with full electrical loadswithout the considerations of prelubrication or prewarming prior to thetest. The staff concluded that cold fast starts cause unnecessary prematurediesel engine degradation and that some testing techniques for EDGs didnot take into consideration their manufacturers recommended preparatoryactions such as prelubrication of moving parts and warm-up procedures priorto starting. Specifically the licensee proposes to change the TS to: (A) Specify prelubrication and prewarming of EDGs prior to preplanned EDGstarts. Prelubrication/prewarming would decrease the wear and stress onthe EDGs and would increase reliability and availability. (B) Provide for gradual acceleration and gradual electrical load increasesto an indicated load range during EDG testing in accordance with manufacturersrecommendations in order to decrease the stresses inherent with rapid acceleration,sudden large electrical load changes and routine overloading. (C) Revise the surveillance starting/testing frequency in order to limitthe incremental wear and stress on the EDGs. (D) Revise the accelerated starting test frequency program. The programwill be based upon the number of failures in the last 20 demands in lieuof the failures in the last 100 valid tests in order to maintain increasedEDG reliability without excessive and damaging surveillance cold fast starts.(E) Allow EDG maintenance inspections (18 month tear down) while at power,rather than ``during shutdown'', in order to decrease outage time usedfor maintenance tear down and allow more time for inspection in lieu ofthe requirement for tear down inspections only under a limited outage schedule.(F) Incorporate the 184 day starting surveillance into Surveillance 4.8.1.1.2.h,allowing this new paragraph for prelubrication and prewarming of the EDGswith electrical loading to an indicated range within 200 seconds.

Control rod movement is restricted through the useof rod select, insert, and withdrawal blocks. The Rod Sequence ControlSystem is a hardwired (as opposed to a computer controlled), redundantbackup to the Rod Worth Minimizer. It is independent of the Rod Worth Minimizerin terms of inputs and outputs but the two systems are compatible. TheRSCS is designed to monitor and block when necessary operator control rodselection, withdrawal and insertion actions, and thus assist in preventingsignificant control rod pattern errors which could lead to a control rodwith a high reactivity worth (if dropped). A significant pattern erroris one of several abnormal events all of which must occur to have a RDAwhich might exceed fuel energy density limit criteria for the event. Itwas designed only for possible mitigation of the RDA and is active onlyduring low power operation (currently generally less than 20 percent power)when a RDA might be significant. It provides rod blocks on detection ofa significant pattern error. It does not prevent a RDA. A similar patterncontrol function is also performed by the RWM, a computer controlled system.All reactors having a RSCS also have a RWM. In response to a topical report submitted by the BWR Owner's Group, onDecember 27, 1987 we issued a letter with a supporting safety evaluationapproving (1) elimination of the RSCS while retaining the RWM to providebackup to the operator for control rod pattern control and (2) loweringthe setpoint for turnoff of RWM to 10% of rated thermal power from itscurrent 20% level. (Letter, A. C. Thadani, NRC to J. S. Charnley, GE, Subject:Acceptance for Referencing of Licensing Topical Report NEDE-24011-P-A,``General Electric Standard Application for Reactor Fuel,'' Revision 8,Amendment 17.) The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: 1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; 2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's analysis contained in their December 14, 1988 letter statesthe following in response to the three NRC criteria referenced above: <ITAG tagnum="21">Deletion of the RSCS and reduction of the RWMS low power set pointfrom 20% to 10% does not involve a significant hazards consideration becauseit does not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Significantly increase the probability of occurrence or the consequencesof an accident or malfunction of equipment related to safety as previouslyevaluated in the FSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nonsafety-related RSCS and RWM are not required for nor do theysupport the proper operation of other systems. Hence, deleting the RSCSand changing the low power set point on the RWM has no effect one way orthe other on the probability of equipment malfunction in other systemsor within the RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The probability of occurrence of an accident is not affected by thischange. These changes impact only the rod drop accident (RDA) analyses.The probability of an RDA is dependent only on the control rod drive systemand mechanisms themselves, and not in any way on the RSCS or RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The consequence of an RDA as evaluated in the LGS FSAR will not beaffected by this modification. An extensive probabilistic study was performedby the NRC staff (letter and enclosure from B. C. Rusche, NRR, to R. Fraley,ACRS, dated June 1, 1976, ``Generic Item II A-2 Control Rod Drop Accident(BWRs)''). This study indicated that there was not a need for the RSCS.Furthermore, improved methodologies in the RDA analysis methods (e.g. BNL-NUREG28109, ``Thermal Hydraulic Effects on Center Rod Drop Accident in a BWR,''October 1980) indicated that the peak fuel enthalpies resulting from anRDA are significantly lower than previously determined by less refinedmethodologies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The RSCS duplicates the function of the RWM. So long as the RWM isoperable, the RSCS is not needed since the RWM prevents control rod patternerror. In the event the RWM is out of service, after the withdrawal ofthe first 12 control rods, the proposed Technical Specifications requirethat control rod movement and compliance with the prescribed control rodpattern be verified by a second licensed operator or technically qualifiedmember of the technical staff. The verification process is controlled procedurallyto ensure a high quality, independent review of control rod movement. Inaddition, to further minimize control rod movement at low power with theRWM out of service, the proposed Technical Specifications will permit onlyone plant start-up per calendar year with the RWM out of service priorto or during the withdrawal of the first twelve control rods. All the abovetaken together demonstrates consistency and applicability to those conclusionsreached in the referenced SER, and substantiate the conclusion that therewill be no increase in the consequences of an RDA as evaluated in the FSARas a result of eliminating the RSCS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There will also be no increase in the consequences of an RDA as evaluatedin the FSAR due to lowering the RWM set point from 20% to 10%. The effectsof an RDA are more severe at low power levels and are less severe as powerlevel increases. Although the original calculations for the RDA were performedat 10% power, the NRC required that the generic BWR Technical Specificationsbe written to require operation of the RWM below 20% power in order toensure conservatism. However, GE continued to perform the RDA analysesat and below 10% power because these produced more conservative analyticalresults. Recently, more refined calculations by BNL have shown that evenwith the maximum single control rod position error, and most multiple controlrod error patterns, the peak fuel rod enthalpy reached during an RDA fromthese control rod patterns would not exceed the NRC limit of 280 cal/gmfor RDAs above 10% power, confirming the original GE analyses. Hence, loweringthe RWM set point from 20% to 10% will not result in an increase in theconsequences of an RDA as evaluated in the FSAR. The previously referencedNRC SER has concluded this RWM set point reduction to be acceptable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility for an accident or malfunction of a differenttype than any evaluated in the FSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operation of the RSCS and RWM cannot cause or prevent an accident.They function to minimize the consequences of an RDA. The RDA is alreadyevaluated in the FSAR, and the effect of this proposed change on the analysesis discussed in Item 1 above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Elimination of the RSCS and lowering the RWM set point will have noimpact on the operation of any other systems, and hence would not contributeto a malfunction in any other equipment nor create the possibility foran accident to occur which has not already been evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Elimination of the RSCS will not lower the margin of safety for thereasons discussed in Item 1 above and summarized below: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) An extensive NRC study has determined that the possibility ofan RDA resulting in unacceptable consequences is so low as to negate therequirement for the RSCS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Recent calculations have determined that the consequences of anRDA are acceptable above 10% power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The RSCS is redundant in function to the RWM. Eliminating theRSCS does not eliminate the control rod pattern monitoring function performedby the RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) To ensure that the RWM will be in service when required, the proposedRWM Technical Specification will be revised to allow only one startup percalendar year with the RWM out of service prior to or during the withdrawalof the first twelve control rods. If the RWM is out of service below 10%power, control rod movement and compliance with prescribed control rodpatterns will be verified by a second licensed operator or technicallyqualified member of the technical staff. This situation is controlled bya station procedure which specifically requires the following: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; Plant Management approval is required in order for the operatorto bypass the inoperable RWM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; A second operator or technically qualified staff member,with no other duties, is required to verify the first operator's actionswhile the first operator performs rod movements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; The startup and the shutdown sequences with their respectivesignoff sheets are provided for verification by the second operator foreach step and rod movement made by the first operator. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; The operators are provided with shutdown instructions thatwould allow a shutdown sequence that would result in a control rod patternwhich would agree with RWM pattern if that system were not bypassed andwas controlling. These instructions identify, for the operator, the RWMshutdown step to be initiated for further rod insertion below the RWM lowpower setpoint (i.e. 10% reactor power). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no significant reduction in the margin of safety resultingfrom lowering the RWM set point from 20% to 10% because calculations byGE and BNL have shown that even with the maximum single control rod positionerror, and most multiple error patterns, the peak fuel rod enthalpy duringan RDA from these patterns would not exceed the NRC limit (280cal/gm) above10% power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary GE has provided technical justification for the proposedchanges in the Topical Report NEDE-24011-P-A and associated referenceswhich justify the acceptability of the proposed changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NRC has reviewed and accepted the GE analysis and provided guidelinesfor licensees wanting to make the changes proposed in NEDE-24011-P-A andapproved in the NRC SER issued December 27, 1987 to J.

The error resulted in generating nonconservativebuilding temperatures for a variety of smaller high energy line break (HELB)sizes. Reanalyses of the HELB scenarios confirmed that a number of smallerHELB sizes resulted in higher delayed building temperature peaks than previouslyanalyzed. To reduce those peaks, a modification to the Steamline RuptureDetection/Isolation Setpoint was required. The new Fixed High TemperatureTrip Setpoint is based on an Analysis Value of 180 degrees fahrenheit.This trip will allow automatic isolation of those HELBs which do not producea building temperature rate-of-rise rapid enough to cause a trip of SLRDIS.The Fixed High Temperature Trip Setpoint enhances equipment qualificationby reducing the magnitude of the delayed building temperature peaks forsmaller HELBs and permits timely operator access to perform any manualactions which may be required. The final EQ composite temperature profileused for future equipment qualification incorporates the new Fixed HighTemperature Trip Setpoint in addition to the existing Rate-of-Rise TripSetpoint as submitted in P-88344 dated September 28, 1988. This change to the Technical Specifications implements this Fixed HighTemperature Trip Setpoint by modifying LCO 4.41 and SR 5.4.1. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensee submitted the following evaluation of significant hazardsconsiderations for this amendment request: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Amendment does not involve a significant hazards considerationbecause operation of the Fort St. Vrain Nuclear Generating Station in accordancewith this proposed modification would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recent reanalyses determined that certain postulated HELBs could resultin temperatures in excess of the original composite temperature profileused in the Environmental Qualification Program. While the initial peaktemperatures were reduced, a variety of smaller breaks resulted in higherdelayed temperatures. The addition of a new Fixed High Temperature TripSetpoint will enable SLRDIS to automatically detect and isolate a numberof the smaller HELBs which do not produce a temperature rate-of-rise rapidenough to cause a SLRDIS Rate-of-Rise Trip. This trip would significantlymitigate the delayed temperature peaks, thus enhancing equipment qualificationand ensuring that the resultant temperatures will not prevent timely buildingaccess. The electrical equipment per 10 CFR 50.49 remains qualified withthe new composite profile. The consequences of a SLRDIS actuation are addressedin FSAR Section 7.3.10.4. The consequences of SLRDIS actuations are nodifferent than previously analyzed for the Rate-of-Rise Trip Setpoint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The required function of SLRDIS is to isolate both primary and secondarycoolant loops in the event of a HELB, resulting in an interruption of forcedcirculation cooling (IOFC). The consequences of a SLRDIS actuation havebeen evaluated in the FSAR. The added Fixed High Temperature Trip Setpointadds a new point in the elevation of bulk building average temperatureat which SLRDIS will trip. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the new trip results only in changing the programming, all previousfailure modes and malfunctions remain unchanged. Recovery following a SLRDISactuation may be accomplished by one of three methods: (1) normal keyboardcommands provided that the ambient temperature sensed by at least 3 ofthe 4 sensors has returned below the trip setpoint; or (2) manipulatingthe SLRDIS detection rack bypass key switch; or (3) removal of the SLRDISXCR's (control relays) in control board 93-I-10. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The basis for SLRDIS in LCO 4.4.1 states that detection of steam leaksis required for environmental qualification of safe shutdown cooling systems.The detection system utilizes a pre-trip fixed temperature alarm to initiatemanual operator actions to isolate the steam leak and a Rate-of-Rise TripSetpoints to initiate an automatic isolation. Both detection points ensurethat the resultant harsh environment from a postulated steam leak is limitedsuch that the safe shutdown systems will be capable of performing theirsafety function under the environmental conditions and permit timely buildingaccess. Adding a new Fixed High Temperature Trip Setpoint enhances therequired detection and resultant protective actions to limit the harshenvironment. The same system accuracy and setpoint uncertainty methodologywere applied to calculate the new Fixed High Temperature Allowable Valueand Trip Setpoint. The added trip setpoint neither causes any new singlefailure points nor compromises the system detection. The operability requirementsas defined in the Technical Specifications remain unchanged for the newHELB analyses and SLRDIS Fixed High Temperature Trip Setpoint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No single failure can result in the actuation of the SLRDIS safetyfunction or preclude the safety function from occurring. EE-EQ-0033, Rev.C has been updated to conservatively reflect the impact of a prolongedloss of HVAC condition on SLRDIS actuation with the new Fixed High TemperatureTrip Setpoint. The temperature in either the reactor building or turbinebuilding will not cause a SLRDIS actuation for a loss of HVAC conditionof less than or equal to 6 hours. Prior to 6 hours, corrective action,if required, could be implemented to reduce building temperatures. Thenew trip setpoint is slightly higher than the existing reactor buildinghigh temperature scram setpoint of 161 degrees F, which has not actuatedin the past and would not be expected to actuate except during a HELB orDesign Basis Accident No. 2. Therefore, it is concluded that the probabilityfor inadvertent actuation of SLRDIS is not increased by the 171 degreesF.

The proposedsurveillance requirements relate to these modifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A modification was made to install redundant class 1E circuit protectiondevices between the non-class 1E RPS power supplies and the class 1E RPSpower supplies. These circuit protective devices consist of a contractorwhich will open by (1) an overvoltage relay with a trip level setting ofless than or equal to 126.5 Vac, (2) an undervoltage relay with a triplevel setting of greater than or equal to 113.4 Vac for the MG sets, (3)an undervoltage relay with a trip level setting of greater than or equalto 111.8 Vac for alternate supply, and (4) an underfrequency relay triplevel setting of greater than or equal to 57 Hz on all devices. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The cabinets and conduits for each RPS power monitoring system arelocated in the control building, which is a seismic category 1 structure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This structure will provide protection from effects of tornadoes,tornado missiles, and external floods. The components of each monitoringsystem are also seismically qualified for class 1E application as requiredby GDC 2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to comply to GDC 21, there are two physically independentand fully redundant circuit interrupters provided for each RPS bus, includingalternate supply. This redundancy provides single failure protection incase one circuit does not function properly. This also provides sufficientreliability to ensure the RPS performs its intended safety function. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The BFN Final Safety Analysis (FSAR) Section 7.2.3.2 states that thepower to each of the two reactor protection trip systems is supplied, viaa separate bus, by its own high-inertia, a-c motor generator set. The highinertia is provided by a flywheel. The inertia is sufficient to maintainvoltage and frequency within 275% of rates values for at least 1.0 secondfollowing total loss of power to the MG set. In applying this to Section14.5.4.4.b of the FSAR accident analysis, loss of auxiliary power assumesthe RPS MG set coastdown time until loss of MG generator output voltageto be 5.0 seconds. Thus the upper and lower bounds for voltage output andtime delay are identified as significant performance parameters expectedfrom the MG set design. The RPS power monitoring system installed is designedby the MG sets to provide no time delay. Consequently, the trip level settingsfor the RPS power monitor must be outside the expected operating rangeof the MG set. For a nominal 120 Vac MG output voltage, the 5% regulationband (114 to 126 volts) is within the technical specification trip levelsetting of 113.4 to 126.5 Vac. This will allow the MG set to function withinits intended and designed time and voltage range before the RPS power monitoringsystem trips. These settings support the design and function of the high-inertiaMG sets, and therefore, support the assumptions made in the BFN FSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the design, trip level settings, and intended functionof the RPS power monitoring system are both bounded and support the currentBFN FSAR accident analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not affect the operation or intended functionof any currently installed safety related equipment. If all the protectivecircuits in one MG fail to open, the redundant train of RPS systems isstill available to mitigate any design basis accident. The RPS power monitoringsystem does not perform any specific safety function therefore, failurewould, at worst case, be bounded by the current BFN Final Safety Analysis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The additional surveillance requirements resulting from the subjectmodification, enhance to overall dependability of the RPS system. By specifyingovervoltage, undervoltage, and underfrequency values ensures that the RPSpower monitoring system will protect the RPS components so they performtheir intended function. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This system provides no direct safety function. It provides isolationbetween the non-class 1E RPS power supplies and the class 1E power distributionbuses. It functions to isolate the RPS power distribution buses upon detectionof overvoltage, undervoltage, and underfrequency on the RPS power suppliesthereby preventing possible adverse operation of the class 1E RPS componentsoutside their designed voltage and current ranges. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Therefore, the staffproposes to determine that the application for amendments involves no significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Athens Public Library, SouthStreet, Athens, Alabama 35611. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority,400 West Summit Hill Drive, E11 B33, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. <T3>NRC Assistant Director: </T3>Suzanne Black <ITAG tagnum="84">The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Duquesne Light Company,Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, Toledo Edison Company,Docket No. 50-440, Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, Lake County,Ohio </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>November 28, 1988 as amended December29, 1988. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldincrease the minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) in the Technical Specifications(TS) from 1.06 to 1.07 to account for additional uncertainties which normallyoccur in the second and subsequent operating cycles. It also would addtwo limiting lattice MAPLHGR (most-limiting average planar linear heatgeneration rate) curves to the TS to account for two new GE8X8EB fuel typesbeing used this cycle and delete the MAPLHGR curve for the natural uraniumbundles which are being totally removed during the refueling outage. Thelimiting conditions for operation and action statements for the APLHGRwould be revised to reflect the lattice-dependent MAPLHGR limits in theGESTAR analysis and the default limits in TS figures for hand calculations.The TS would be reworded to clarify how power-dependent MAPLHGR factors(MAPFAC<T2>p</T2>) are applied to the lattice MAPLHGR's and reflect NRC guidancein the GESTAR safety evaluation report. Figures and pages would also berenumbered and reordered. The extrapolated value for MCPR<T2>f</T2> (figure 3.2.2-1 of the TS) (the calculated MCPR at a given pointof core flow) is being corrected by the factor of [1.0 +0.0032 (40-F)]where F = percent of rated core flow, to provide additional conservatismat lower core flows (below 40% of rated flow). Additionally, the flow dependentMAPLHGR factor (MAPFAC<T2>f</T2>) curve (figure 3.2.1-4) is being extended down to the 20% ratedcore flow line to account for core flow shortfalls which were demonstratedduring the startup testing program. (This figure is also being renumbered,the new number will be 3.2.1-1). The proposed amendment would also delete two curves (A-A' and B-B') fromthe current set of MCPR parametric (MCPR<T2>p</T2>) curves (those curves which specify the power-dependent MCPRlimit at reduced feedwater temperatures for various core average exposuresand core flows). Thermal margin during the second cycle will be maintainedusing curve C-C' as the limit and the C-C' designation will be removed.Additionally, the TS related to the LHGR (linear heat generation rate orheat-generation-per-unit-length of fuel rod) would be revised to reflectthe higher LHGR associated with the new fuel. The definition of criticalpower ratio would be generalized by changing GEXL to a GE critical powercorrelation. The associated bases would also be changed. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The standards used to arrive at a determination that a request foramendment requires no significant hazards consideration are included inthe Commission's Regulations, 10 CFR 50.92(c), which states that the operationof the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1)involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensees have providedthe following analysis concerning the above three factors: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed changes would not involve a significant increase inthe consequences of an accident previously evaluated because MCPR, MCPR<T2>f</T2>, LHGR, MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> and MAPLHGR core operating limits are provided to establishbounds on normal reactor operations which ensure core conditions are maintainedwithin the assumptions and scope of accident analyses. New MAPLHGR andMAPFAC<T2>f</T2> curves and LHGR, MCPR and MCPR<T2>f</T2> limits are provided to reflect changes in the reactor fuel configurationand design assumptions. Operation within these limits will assure the consequencesof affected transients and accidents will remain within the results andbounds of the safety analyses. MAPLHGR, MAPFAC<T2>f</T2>, MCPR<T2>f</T2> and MCPR curves/limits were generated using analytical methodspreviously approved by the NRC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Safety Limit MCPR is determined using a statistical model thatcombines uncertainties in operating parameters with uncertainties usedto calculate the critical power. For reload cores, some of the uncertaintiesused in the determination of the Safety Limit MCPR are larger than forinitial cores. The higher Safety Limit MCPR for reload cores accounts forthese increased uncertainties. The Safety Limit MCPR for reload cores hasreceived previous NRC approval and is documented within the Updated SafetyAnalysis Report (USAR) and in GESTAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The critical power ratios in the transient analyses were calculatedusing the improved critical power correlation, GEXL-Plus. This correlationhas been approved by the NRC (SER to Amendment 15 of GESTAR). Its predecessorGEXL was used for the initial core analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LHGR limit for GE8X8EB fuel was calculated using the GESTR-MECHANICALcode (a fuel rod thermal-mechanical performance model accepted by the NRCin GESTAR). Results from GESTR-MECHANICAL demonstrate that compliance withthe new LHGR limit (in concert with appropriate MAPLHGR curves) will furtherensure fuel design basis criteria are satisfied for GE8X8EB fuel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Extended operating domains and modes of operation have been analyzedby GE (using NRC-approved methods) to determine applicable operating restrictions.GE demonstrated that the consequences of changes to the allowable operatingregion are bounded by the proposed values for MCPR and MAPLHGR. Furthermore,the probability of an accident is not increased because operation in theexpanded region does not significantly alter the normal operation of theequipment, for which failures have been previously analyzed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becauseproposed MCPR, MCPR<T2>f</T2>, MAPLHGR, MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> and LHGR limits do not directly affect the operation or functionof any system or component but instead set fuel or core thermal limitsso that operation within these limits will maintain the analyzed marginsof safety. </ITAG>The Safety Limit MCPR was adjusted in the conservative direction becauseof calculational uncertainties associated with reload cores to maintainthe margin of safety. MAPLHGR limits are provided for each bundle typeto ensure that the requirements of 10 CFR 50.46 and Appendix K are maintained.The limits are results of the reload transient and Emergency Core CoolingSystem (ECCS) analyses and are designed to maintain the same margins ofsafety. Therefore, this change would not create the possibility of an accidentdifferent than previously evaluated. <ITAG tagnum="21">Expanded operating regions represent changes to the core power andflow distribution, but do not significantly affect the operation or functionof any system or component. Operating limits were established by analysesto bound all combinations of specified expanded operating domains and equipmentout of service within acceptable analyzed conditions to ensure fuel integrityand ECCS criteria. Consequently, there is no significant impact on or additionto any system or equipment whose failure could initiate an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed changes would not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety because all of the proposed changes have been analyzedto the same governing criteria as before and demonstrate that the consequencesof transients or accidents are not increased beyond these already evaluatedby the NRC for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Safety Limit MCPR is set at the point at which no fuel damageis expected to occur as discussed in GESTAR. The Safety Limit MCPR is combinedwith the most limiting transient change to the critical power ratio toestablish the operating limit MCPR. The Safety Limit MCPR and the changeresulting from the most limiting transient have been calculated by methodsdescribed in GESTAR. These methods have received previous NRC approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MAPLHGR's are determined by analysis to ensure the acceptance criteriaof 10 CFR 50.46 are met and establish the margins of safety for fuel andthe ECCS. Calculations using NRC-approved models described in GESTAR yieldresults within these acceptance criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, the fuel used in Cycle 2 is very similar to that usedin the previous cycle and the core will be operated using NRC-approvedmethods. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards considerationdetermination. With respect to operation in the extended operating domains,the staff notes that the licensees have implemented procedures, in responseto NRC Bulletin 88-07 dated June 15, 1988, which require scramming theplant immediately following a dual recirculation pump trip. Further, whilein the maximum extended operating domain region, core flow will be maintainedabove 45%. These measures significantly reduce the possibility of poweroscillations while in the extended operating domain. Given these considerations,the staff concurs with the licensees' no significant hazards determination.Therefore, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Perry Public Library, 3753Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay Silberg, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Pottsandamp; Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John N.
