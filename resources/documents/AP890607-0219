The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 5.07points Tuesday, lost another 15.04 points, or 0.04 percent, tofinish the morning session at 33,436.97.   The dollar was trading at late morning at 142.88 yen, afteropening lower at 142.45 yen, down 0.18 yen from Tuesday's close of142.63 yen. The currency moved in the range of 142.40 to 143.00 yen.   There were two main incentives in the foreign exchange marketWednesday: an incentive to buy due to the turmoil in China, and oneto sell sparked by a prime rate cut by U.S. banks, said MitsuhikoKinugawa, a trader at Daiwa Bank.   He said the buying pressure due to the situation in China wasstronger.   Investors tend to purchase dollars in times of uncertainty orcrisis.   ``Although Japanese investors don't have a feeling of emergency,they are buying because of reactions overseas,'' he said.   Many market players believe the U.S. Federal Reserve Board hasbeen easing its monetary policy since major U.S. banks lowered theirprime lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 11 percent Monday.   The trader said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market byselling the dollar to support the yen. He said the amount of thebank's selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on itsmonetary activities.   On the stock market, the index fell marginally mainly due toselling for profit-taking after earlier gains, while the majority ofmarket players remained on the sidelines.   Other traders said turmoil in China contributed to thewait-and-see mood in the Tokyo market.   Japanese goverment has urged the swift evacuation of Japaneseresidents in China. Many Japanese businesses in China have closedtemporarily and brought employees back to Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
