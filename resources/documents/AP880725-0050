Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader ofHezbollah, or Party of God, made the comments in a sermon Sunday asIran prepared to enter U.N.-sponsored talks to end its 8-year-oldwar with Iraq.   Fadlallah accused the United States and Europe of using thehostage crisis for political purposes. But he also called for aswift resolution to the problem.   ``We call for a just and practical solution to ths problem toachieve a happy ending,'' he said.   ``We are aware that the (hostages) problem has reached such adegree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed upwith its humanitarian aspect.''   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for Shiite factionsholding most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon. NineAmericans are among the captives.   Fadlallah's comments came during a one-hour sermon to Shiitesmarking the major Moslem feast of al-Adha in south Beirut's Birel-Abed mosque.   The hostages are widely believed to be held in Hezbollah's HayMadi barracks building about 10 blocks from the mosque in Beirut'ssouthern suburbs.   Syria has had some 5,000 troops patrolling most of the southernsuburbs since May 27, but they have stayed away from the immediatearea of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontationthat could imperil the hostages.   Syrian soldiers, however, control all approaches to Hay Madi andman high-rise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks.   It was not clear whether Fadlallah's call signaled abreakthrough for the hostages. He has made similar statements inthe past two years with no results.   ``On the occasion of this feast, we call on all sides to beginacting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect ofthis problem could be resolved,'' he said.   ``We feel pain for the detention (of the hostages) because theissue has humanitarian aspects,'' Fadlallah said.   He accused the United States and European nations of``manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons toimpose their dominance on the world.   ``America has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather usedit as a means of political pressure on each country and people thatresist its imperlialist policies,'' he added.   It was Fadlallah's first reference to the hostages issue sinceIran announced July 18 that it was accepting the year-old U.N.Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in its warwith Iraq.   Political observers believe a truce could facilitate efforts forthe release of the hostages.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, appearing on the NBC's``Meet the Press,'' said Sunday that improved U.S.-Iranianrelations could lead to the release of the American hostages.   On the terms of a release, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously notgoing to discuss any quid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talkto us about the hostage situation and how they're going to go aboutinfluencing their release, we'd be delighted to talk to them aboutit. I'm not in the slightest suggesting that there would be anydeal for the hostages. That is contrary to our policy.''   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into adialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do isdesignate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us andwe'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, aboutterrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever isappropriate.''   The longest held hostages is Terry Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEeast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was seized March16, 1985.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, reached by telephone Sunday at herhome in Cadiz, Ky., said, ``I don't see that it (the holding ofhostages) should be a political issue. It's a human issue.   ``Everything I've been hearing out of the Middle East latelygives us reason to hope and it's been a very, very long time sincewe've had occasion to be hopeful.''</TEXT></DOC>
