A team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New Yorkand Cornell University Medical College selected 58 study subjectsfrom patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheriteddisorder characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon thatalmost always will progress to cancer without treatment.   The patients had had the colon _ the large bowel _ removed.   The report appearing Tuesday in the Journal of the NationalCancer Institute used statistics to show that ``the ratio of rectalpolyps to baseline was uniformly negatively correlated with highfiber'' _ that is, the higher the fiber, the fewer the polyps.   Rectal polyps frequently decline spontaneously after removal ofthe large bowel in this disorder.   Members of the high fiber-group consumed an average of 22 gramsof fiber a day, about twice what is contained in an average diet,through the inclusion of special cereals in their diet. Only about10 percent of the population normally includes this much fiber.   Several studies have suggested that high-fiber, low-fat dietsmight protect against cancer of the rectum and the bowel. Studiesthat follow patients on a prescribed diet for a long period _ fouryears for the NCI group _ are rare, however.   ``The results reported by these investigators are encouraging forthe management not only of patients with familial adenomatouspolyposis, but also others at risk of developing colorectal cancer,the second most frequent cause of cancer mortality in the UnitedStates,'' said an editorial in the journal.   The researchers said it was not known whether the protectiveeffect of grain fiber might also work in patients at risk fornon-inherited polyps. ``Enough correspondences exist between the twoconditions to warrant active inquiry,'' their report said.   The pre-cancerous benign tumors that develop in the two forms ofthe disease are indistinguishable, noted the team of researchers ledby Jerome J. DeCosse.</TEXT></DOC>
