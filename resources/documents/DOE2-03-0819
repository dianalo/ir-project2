The nodes in thenetwork represent possible matches between points in each image. Becausethe authors only consider matches between intensity edges, only a fewof these nodes actually represent candidate matches for a give pair ofimages; consequently, only the active part of the network is ever constructedby the simulation. This includes the nodes representing candidate matchesand the connections between these candidate matches as defined by a varietyof constraints. Thus, the simulation involves constructing a list ofmatches and a list of connections, and simulating the iterations of thenetwork. Each of these phases can be partitioned among a number of processorswith very little interference between the processors due to synchronizationor mutual exclusion. The resulting parallel implementation produced nearlylinear speed-ups for up to the nine processors in the system.</TEXT></DOC>
