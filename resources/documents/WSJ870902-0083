SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NSM SLBTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><TEXT>   National Semiconductor Corp. said it reached a definitive agreement to acquire Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. for $122 million in common stock and warrants, a transaction that reflects growing consolidation in the recovering U.S. chip industry.    The transaction would give Santa Clara, Calif.-based National a major presence in the growing market for high-performance semiconductors and boost its military business. For Fairchild, a Silicon Valley pioneer ravaged by huge losses in recent years, analysts see further turmoil ahead, as National pares redundant operations. For Schlumberger Ltd., the New York-based oil services company that has owned Fairchild since 1979, the transaction would conclude a costly diversification, including a $220 million charge against earnings expected for the third quarter.    &quot;There has been nothing happy about it except that Schlumberger has finally found a way of getting out,&quot; said James D. Crandell, a Salomon Brothers Inc. oil service analyst.    Even the exit is going to be painful. The price is far below the estimated $200 million to $250 million that Fujitsu Ltd. agreed to pay for 80% of Fairchild last fall. Fujitsu dropped its plan in March amid Reagan administration concern over possible foreign domination of U.S. chip interests.    Several other bidders had since emerged for Fairchild, including a management-led buy-out. Fairchild officials weren't available for comment yesterday, and National said it was too early to discuss any personnel changes. National employs 29,000 people, and Fairchild has about 9,000.    A Schlumberger spokesman declined comment on the price. &quot;This is much more in line with the fundamentals&quot; than the Fujitsu offer, said Drew Peck, chip analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. &quot;I think National got a bargain,&quot; said Adam Cuhney, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.'s chip analyst.    The stocks of both companies responded positively to the announcement. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, National closed at $15.75, up 87.5 cents, while Schlumberger closed at $47.375, up $1.125.    The companies said Schlumberger will receive stock and warrants with a &quot;guaranteed cash value&quot; of about $122 million. At current prices, a National spokeswoman said, the company will be issuing about four million common shares along with warrants to acquire about six million more. The company currently has about 100 million common shares outstanding. The companies hope to complete the transaction in about a month, following routine federal antitrust review.    &quot;We believe this acquisition provides complementary strengths -- broadening our product offerings, customer base and technology -- and further enhances our competitive position,&quot; Charles E. Sporck, National's president and chief executive officer said.    Fairchild manufactures special highspeed chips that are used in the widening market for sophisticated mainframe computers. It has also been a major government chip supplier. For National, &quot;it fills a hole in their product offering,&quot; according to Mr. Peck, who said it would extend National's reputation as a supplier of standard components to one that is more on the leading edge.    National also thinks it will benefit from the price it is paying. Even at the outset, &quot;we do not see any significant negative impact on our bottom line,&quot; the spokeswoman said, adding, &quot;there are some real positives from buying assets at a fraction of book value.&quot; Other analysts noted that Fairchild itself is finally beginning to feel the effects of the U.S. chip recovery, partly aided by rebounding government orders.    Fairchild's sales run about $500 million annually, or about half the roughly $1 billion in annual chip sales that National generates, National said.    The acquisition excludes several mothballed plants, including major facilities in Japan and West Germany, which industry sources said Schlumberger may be close to selling to others. National will gain 10 plants, half in the U.S. and half overseas.    National had been a rumored suitor, but most analysts thought the company would try to acquire a smaller portion of Fairchild's assets. Analysts said redundancies, particularly among basic chip operations, are likely, and that National will be shedding some properties. A National spokeswoman said there hadn't been any decisions made, but that &quot;any time you merge two companies you're going to find some overlap.&quot; She also said, &quot;We certainly hope some of the management will choose to join us.&quot;    Schlumberger acquired Fairchild in 1979 for $425 million, but the chip slump and other problems hurt it almost from the start. In 1985, Fairchild had a $627 million net loss, including special charges for selling assets or closing facilities. Last year, the loss narrowed to $93 million.    The sale to National comes at a time when Schlumberger's core business is starting to recover, thanks to firming oil prices and a modest increase in drilling. The company had a first-half profit, but analysts said the Fairchild charge would overwhelm third-quarter oil-related profits. In the 1986 third quarter, Schlumberger had a $42 million net loss on revenue of $1.33 billion.    The transaction follows a growing number of mergers and joint ventures among chip makers. In April, for instance, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to acquire Monolithic Memories Inc. in an estimated $425 million stock swap, and several electronics concerns have recently formed joint ventures to share technology or production facilities.    &quot;The industry is maturing,&quot; said Byron Walker, semiconductor analyst for Moody's Investors Service. &quot;Companies are seeing real advantages in combining, and I think you'll see more.&quot;    Some analysts believe the consolidation wave is needed if U.S. chip concerns are to compete long-term with Japanese electronic conglomerates. The irony is that the latest merger was made possible by the U.S. government, which has long railed against Japanese government involvement in industrial policy and trade practices.    In Washington, a Justice Department spokesman said the department currently isn't investigating the antitrust implications of the National-Fairchild accord. He said the department will soon determine if such an investigation is warranted.    The Justice Department previously investigated the proposed Fujitsu acquisition and is likely to examine the agreement with National Semiconductor.    In its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, National had its first profit since 1985, reporting net income of $8.1 million, or six cents a share, compared with a $7.1 million net loss a year earlier. Sales jumped 28% to $511.9 million from $397.8 million.    ---                       The Fairchild Saga   1979: Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services concern,acquires Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. for $425 million.   1985: Schlumberger takes a one-time fourth-quarter chargeof $486 million to reflect the falling value of Fairchild.
