If So, Dingell Says, Congress MustOK It</HEAD><BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration plans to collect $2.45billion from profits of companies making ozone-destroyingchemicals, but a House committee chairman says it looks like a tax_ and that's a job for Congress.   The administration doesn't call it a tax against makers ofenvironmentally damaging chemicals. But, to Rep. John D. Dingell,chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, it appears tobe an attempted end run around the taxing authority of Congress.   The money would be collected either by a fee, favored by theEnvironmental Protection Agency, or by auctioning the rights toproduce the chemicals, a proposal developed by the Office ofManagement and Budget.   Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said he hasn't decided whethersiphoning off the profits is a bad idea but he's making a lot ofnegative comments about it.   He said the administration has ``no specific authority'' tocollect the money, that courts ``view the taxing power ofgovernment narrowly,'' that he's ``not sure'' House Ways and MeansCommittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., would approve, andthat ``I was reading Mr. Bush's lips like everyone else'' when thepresident said he opposed new taxes.   ``Before I come to a conclusion, I want to hear from a unionwhose plant is going to be shut down,'' Dingell said, adding, ``itis contingent on Congress enacting it, the people accepting it andthe courts approving it.''   The manufacturers are not happy, either. ``They'll be sued. Wewill challenge it for sure,'' said Tony Vogelsberg, an officialwith Du Pont, the largest maker of the chemicals.   Targets for the revenue-raising are windfall profits chemicalfirms could make after an international treaty reduces supplies ofchlorofluorocarbons _ known as CFCs _ which poke holes in the ozonelayer and increase the risk of skin cancer. Industry is developingsubstitutes, but those won't be ready for production for anestimated three to five years.   OMB has budgeted $400 million in revenues in fiscal 1990, $1.5billion in 1991 and $550 million in 1992. The first-year revenuefigures survived an overall budget agreement between congressionalnegotiators and the administration.   ``We will get that $400 million somehow, one way or another,''vowed OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay, referring to the first-yearprojected revenues. ``You have to base the argument for windfallprofits on no cheap substitutes being available as supply decreasesand demand remains constant.''   OMB and EPA have been arguing about how to collect the money,but they agree _ and the industry denies _ that there eventuallywill be windfall profits for manufacturers when the nation beginsimplementing the 1987 Montreal Protocol to cut production of CFCs.   The government's theory is that demand will far outstrip supplysome months after July, when production must be frozen at 1986levels. The Montreal Protocol requires that by 1998, production canbe only 50 percent of 1986 figures.   Despite the race to develop substitutes by the fivemanufacturers of CFCs, EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the companiesmay not hurry to produce them if they're making windfall profits oncurrent CFCs.   ``The companies will be making 20 percent less (starting thisyear), and the price could go up 500 to 600 percent,'' Rice said.``They can bring in an incredible amount of money. We're afraid ...they will have the incentive, because of the profit, to stall, todelay ... introduction of the substitutes.''   Vogelsberg said: ``We don't see windfall profits as really beingthere.   ``If I say I have a monopoly position and I'm going to raise theprice, you're going to remember what I did to you. I want tomaintain a long-term business relationship. We will not charge morethan our cost justifies.''   CFCs are used in refrigerators, large air-conditioning units andcar air-conditioners, high energy foam insulation for modernconstruction, solvents for cleaning computer components, andcushions in seats and sofas.</TEXT></DOC>
