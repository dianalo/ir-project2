Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. seemed to softenhis insistence that American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. mustoffer $125 a share in order to negotiate a merger with NCR,according to securities analysts he addressed Friday.   Some of the analysts said Mr. Exley indicated NCR mightconsider less than $125 a share if the economy deterioratesfurther, if NCR can't meet its business plan in the future,if the ATandamp;T siege begins hurting NCR's business or if itsboard members or investment bankers conclude that some lowerprice is fair.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Exley's remarks came at an unusual two-hour meetingwith about a dozen analysts who follow ATandamp;T, not NCR. It washis latest effort to lobby against ATandamp;T's $90-a-share, $6.12billion hostile cash tender offer for the Dayton, Ohio,computer maker. It wasn't clear whether Mr. Exley's comments,in response to numerous questions probing his opposition tothe ATandamp;T bid, constituted much of a change in NCR's position.   &quot;He was standing his ground at $125 and we were attackinghim very hard. He was responding to the constant verbalbarrage of what about this, what about this,&quot; said JoelGross, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities Corp. Asked about a scenario in whichNCR's business weakened, Mr. Gross said, &quot;he didn't concedethat he'd have to accept, but he implied that he would haveto consider ATandamp;T's offer. The phrase he used was, `Then thejig is up.'&quot;   Asked about this account of the meeting, obtained ininterviews with five analysts who attended, an NCR spokesmansaid: &quot;Nothing has changed. The existing offer remainsgrossly inadequate. And Mr. Exley continues to believe NCRshould remain independent.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate. NCR stockrose $1.375 a share to $88 on Friday in composite trading onthe New York Stock Exchange.   NCR is under greater pressure to negotiate since ATandamp;Tannounced last week that 70% of NCR stockholders want toaccept ATandamp;T's bid, and that more than 50% voted to hold aspecial shareholders meeting to oust the NCR board. ATandamp;T hassaid it might raise its bid if NCR would negotiate and showATandamp;T corporate data to justify an increase.   At one point in the meeting, Mr. Exley asked for a show ofhands from analysts who think ATandamp;T's bid for NCR is a goodidea for ATandamp;T. Only about one-third of them raised theirhands. Many ATandamp;T analysts believe the New York-basedtelecommunications giant should cut its losses in computersand invest more in telecommunications instead.   Mr. Exley said that even if ATandamp;T gains four seats on NCR's13-member board at NCR's annual meeting April 17, he believeshis company can &quot;outrun&quot; ATandamp;T by boosting its earnings andstock price before the 1992 annual meeting, when ATandamp;T couldgain a majority of board seats.   The analysts' meeting followed a new exchange of courtpapers. NCR charged that ATandamp;T's offer violates federalregulations. ATandamp;T pressed its demand for an NCR shareholderlist to aid in its proxy challenge against the NCR board toforce NCR to negotiate.   NCR, in an amended complaint in federal court in Dayton,said ATandamp;T's bid violates federal rules barring ATandamp;T fromusing assets and revenues of its regulated businesses tofinance the acquisition of a non-regulated business. NCR alsosaid ATandamp;T shouldn't be allowed to acquire NCR because ATandamp;T'snew credit-card business makes ATandamp;T a &quot;bank holding company.&quot;   Some experts in telecommunications regulation said theybelieve ATandamp;T can easily finance the NCR offer within existingfederal cost-allocation rules. Washington lawyer RichardWiley, former chairman of the Federal CommunicationsCommission, said NCR's argument is &quot;unlikely to besuccessful.&quot; Robert Bruce, a former FCC general counsel nowat the law firm of Debevoise andamp; Plimpton, said FCC rules don'tbar ATandamp;T from reinvesting regulated business profits intounregulated activities.   ATandamp;T itself scoffed at NCR's bank-holding-companyobjection. It said that if NCR's argument were carried to itslogical conclusion, ATandamp;T would have to get out of thetelecommunications industry.</TEXT></DOC>
