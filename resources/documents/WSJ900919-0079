She confronts life as she wouldconfront a mountain, as a challenge to be surmounted.   Fifty-eight years old and a first-term Democraticcongresswoman now, she was already climbing mountains as ateen-ager. She became the first woman to scale Wyoming'sGrand Teton by a direct ascent of its north face. But inmountains she found tragedy. She's confronting that, too.</LP><TEXT>   Family photographs, so personal you have the uneasyfeeling you've intruded into a living room, line her campaignheadquarters here. There is her daughter Devi climbing hernamesake mountain, India's Nanda Devi. Devi died on thatmountain, in her father's arms. There is her husband, Willi-- the legend who climbed Mount Everest by its stark andstunning West Ridge, the philosopher who searched for meaningabove 10,000 feet. In 1979, three years after Devi's death,Willi was killed by an avalanche.   &quot;I've grown so much tougher since then,&quot; the congresswomansays softly. The gray-haired grandmother will need all thetoughness she can muster. For Rep. Unsoeld is climbing adifferent kind of mountain now.   She may well be the most-endangered Democratic incumbentin the House. Two years ago, surviving the nation's closestHouse race, she squeaked into office by only 618 votes. Nowshe's a top-priority Republican target. An environmentalist,she's caught in the cross fire of the Pacific Northwest'sraging timber war, which pits logging jobs against preservingold-growth forest and the endangered northern spotted owl.It's a no-win issue.   &quot;Things are getting better,&quot; she wryly tells a rally here,recounting the day she joined a parade of angry loggers.&quot;There was only one logger who said, `If I had a gun I'dshoot you.'&quot;   Her southwest Washington district, a region of primetimberland between the Pacific Coast and the high Cascades,is traditionally Democratic. But the timber issue alienatesnormally Democratic voters, and Rep. Unsoeld's GOP opponent,former state legislator Bob Williams, has a proven knack forwinning Democratic votes. A conservative, Mr. Williams isattacking her as an environmental &quot;extremist&quot; who &quot;clearlyhas never been on the side of the workingman.&quot;   This race is a barometer of the volatileenvironment-vs.-logging issue that's roiling politicsthroughout Washington, Oregon and California this year. Butwhat gives the race a dimension beyond politics is thepersonal drama of the woman herself.   She's a self-described &quot;meddler&quot; in government, determinedto remain so. In 1971, she became a self-appointed watchdog,tracking the influence of special-interest money in statepolitics. The title of a study she published stripped thepolitical process to a stark core: &quot;Who Gave? Who Got? HowMuch?&quot; She'd pore over campaign-contribution disclosuresuntil five in the morning, then find herself too keyed up tosleep. The effort, she says, &quot;came close to breaking myhealth.&quot; Elected to the legislature in 1984, she championedopenness in government and tougher regulations fortoxic-waste disposal.   In her quiet but relentless way, she is as driven as herlate husband. Willi Unsoeld, who climbed Mount Everest in1963, believed that &quot;life begins at 10,000 feet.&quot; He spenthis life searching for spiritual wholeness -- &quot;closeness withthe ice, brotherhood with the rock,&quot; he once put it -- in thewind and swirling snow beneath summit after summit.   As a young man, Willi Unsoeld was enchanted by the sheerloveliness of Nanda Devi, India's highest peak. As he toldand retold the story, he decided then and there it was timeto find a wife, father a daughter and name her for themountain. He and Jolene announced their engagement to friendsatop Mount St. Helens. They had four children, two boys andtwo girls. In 1976, Willi took his daughter Devi to climb hermountain.   It all went terribly wrong.   The expedition had pushed above 23,000 feet when Devi wasstricken with acute abdominal pains. The pains continuedthroughout the night. In the early morning, Willi and othersin the group prepared to get her to lower altitude. Almostmatter-of-factly, Devi said: &quot;I'm going to die.&quot; She pitchedforward and was gone. Jolene got the telegram: &quot;. . . Bodycommitted to the mountain.&quot; It was like a burial at sea.   Three years later, death claimed Willi. Anoutdoor-education teacher by then, he led a party of collegestudents on a winter climb of Mount Rainier. A savage stormcaught the group as it descended; an avalanche killed bothWilli and a student with him.   &quot;They say it takes a year&quot; to recover from tragedy, Rep.Unsoeld says. &quot;It takes longer than that.&quot;   She dates her own healing to a wave of utter certaintythat swept over her one day while, of all things, she wasdoing the vacuuming. &quot;I hate doing the vacuuming]&quot; she says.&quot;But I was suddenly aware that {the tragedy} was not a totalloss . . . but rather that all the things my husband and Ihad done, separately and together, had coalesced. It could goon with me.&quot;   So now she campaigns for re-election, a woman far morecomfortable with talking public policy than with asking forthe public's votes. Driving down the interstate, talkinglegislation, she becomes so animated that both hands fly offthe steering wheel. The car cruises on, as if on automaticpilot. But later, after asking for help at a rally, sheadmits to the crowd: &quot;You don't know how hard that is to say.Because I am a very independent cuss.&quot;   Too independent, argues Republican opponent Bob Williams,who calls Rep. Unsoeld far beyond the mainstream of thedistrict. &quot;If she were representing Hollywood, it wouldn't beso bad,&quot; he says. &quot;Even within her party she's consideredextremely liberal.&quot; Republican big guns have flown into theNorthwest to reinforce his campaign -- among them PresidentBush, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and Interior SecretaryManuel Lujan.   Overshadowing all else is the jobs-vs.-environment issue.No one can say with certainty how many jobs are threatened bythe federal decision to save the spotted owl and theold-growth forests in which it lives. But fear and anger arein the air -- a Williams radio spot predicts a loss of asmany as 40,000 jobs -- and even Unsoeld supporters concedethe issue can only hurt her.   &quot;Loggers are going to be mad at somebody, and I thinkthey're going to be mad at incumbents,&quot; says Joe King, theDemocratic speaker of the Washington House. Yet Mr. Kingdraws encouragement from a campaign incident last May.   Picketing loggers blocked the congresswoman's entrance toan indoor event. So for three hours the petite congresswomanstayed outside in a chill wind, listening to burly loggers.After most had drifted away, she climbed inside the truck cabof some latecomers and listened some more.   &quot;I think Jolene will win on character,&quot; ventures Mr. King.&quot;Jeez, that woman has guts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
