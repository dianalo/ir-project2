Lowell P. Weicker Jr. today agreed todrop his call for the Republican platform to include a tougheranti-apartheid stand, thereby making a convention floor fightunlikely on any minority plank.   His move came as the Republican Platform Committee moved towardcompletion of the draft document that will be presented to theparty's national convention next Tuesday.   Steve Snider, a Weicker spokesman, said the senator agreed towithdraw his platform amendment seeking tough sanctions againstapartheid after getting support from Bush campaign officials foranother amendment calling for merger of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, co-chairman of the platform committee,said today at a news conference that with Republicans closing ranksaround their draft platform, it is unlikely any minority amendmentswill be offered at next week's Republican National Convention.   Co-chairman Robert Kasten, a senator from Wisconsin, saidearlier on NBC-TV, ``We've built upon a constructive, conservativeplatform we had in 1984 and then expanded it. We're going to dealwith drugs, we're going to deal with AIDS, we're going to deal witheducation in a more detailed way than in 1984.''   On Wednesday, the 106-member committee resisted moderates'efforts to expand an AIDS plank and to tone down the draft's sternstance against abortion, but they endorsed the concept ofcatastrophic health coverage for sick children.   ``The party is coming together. ... We don't have to haveminority planks because the platform process itself has worked sowell,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, another co-chairman.   Orr and other committee leaders acknowledged that thecatastrophic care plank was vague _ like the Democrats' platformthey criticize relentlessly.   ``Lordy, lordy, there are so many loopholes'' in thecatastrophic plank, said Marilyn Thayer of New Orleans. It does notpromise a new government program, she said, adding, ``Under theRepublican party we don't just look toward government to spendpeople's hard-earned tax dollars to do this.''   The committee voted 55-32 after a heated debate on abortion tokeep intact a declaration that ``the unborn child has a fundamentalindividual right to life which cannot be infringed.''   ```Cannot be infringed' says to me that men and fetuses have aright to life at all times, but women lost that right when theybecome pregnant,'' said Marjorie Bell Chambers of Los Alamos, N.M.,who tried to strike the last four words.   They rejected by voice vote an amendment to allow Medicaidfunding of abortions in cases of rape or incest, despite a pleafrom Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut to recognize that ``rape isawful.''   ``Murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime,''replied anti-abortion delegate Pat Elf of Kihei, Hawaii.   They approved 53-30 a Weicker plank saying the GOP will ``worktoward making catasrophic coverage available to our youngestcitizens.''   Weicker assured fellow delegates there was ``no financialcommitment involved ... but rather a commitment of spirit by thisparty.''   Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer from Irvine,Calif., warned that the Republicans who have pilloried theDemocratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the samepath. The GOP platform pledges not to raise taxes, but ``we allknow (catastrophic coverage) is going to be expensive,'' she said.   They refused by voice vote to expand their plank on the deadlyAIDS disease to endorse the recommendations of the president'scommission, especially its main one calling for anti-discriminationlegislation. Vice President George Bush has endorsed the entireWatkins commission report, but President Reagan has not.   ``The time has come to clearly put us on record for what needsto be done,'' said Weicker. ``Never before have we asked anybodywho was hurting how they got hurt.''   James Summers, an apartment builder from Bellevue, Wash., saidAIDS was ``the first legalized communicable disease in the historyof the United States.''   Summers said ``the strength of the homosexual lobby'' hadprevented the country from taking stronger action to contain theepidemic.   The draft platform, which will be presented to the RepublicanNational Convention on Tuesday, calls for a vigorous fight againstAIDS, ``compassion and help'' for victims and steps to ``protectthose who do not have the disease.''   The committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate apro-Equal Rights Amendment sought by Delaware's Lynn Glaze.   The draft platform holds fast to the party's 1980 and 1984pledges not to raise taxes and to seek a constitutional amendmentoutlawing abortion, and calls for ``rapid and certain deployment''of the Strategic Defense Initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
