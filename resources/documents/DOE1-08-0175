For plane geometry withperiodical boundary conditions certain numerical results obtained byone-velocity theory in the assumption of isotropic neutron scatteringare given. The results explain visually transport effects related tothe finite velocity of neutron propagation in space from a local pulsedsources. Balance equations are solved by the expansion into a seriesover eigen functions of the Helmholtz equation in combination with useof the Laplace transformation for time variable. The analytical solutionunder consideration can be used as a model one to study specificity ofspatial transient processes.</TEXT></DOC>
