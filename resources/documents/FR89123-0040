The proposed rules, if adopted,would amend 201.20 (relating to fees) and 201.21 (relating to availabilityof specific records).These proposed fee waiver rules supersede proposed rules published on June5, 1987 (52 FR 21317).The proposed rules with respect to fees under the Freedom of InformationAct (5 U.S.C. 552) reflect the new fee provisions of the Freedom of InformationReform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No 99-570, section 1803) and conform to theUniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines promulgatedby the Office of Management and Budget (52 FR 10011, March 27, 1987). Theseproposed rules also contain procedures and guidelines for determining whensuch fees should be waived or reduced. The proposed rules parallel ruleson fees and waivers of fees promulgated by the U.S. Department of Justice(<T3>see</T3> 28 CFR Part 16). The recommended charges in proposed rule201.20(b)(1)(ii) for document searches follow such guidelines. They reflectdistinctions between lower grade clerical/professional and higher gradeprofessional/managerial staff costs. They are based on projected January1989 salary levels for GS-8, step 1, and GS-12, step 1, respectively, ascalculated by the Commission's Finance Division, which the Commission estimatesare the average staff grades in each of these two categories of personnellikely to be doing such searches. The fees for computer searches (andSection;201.20(b)(1)(iii)) and review (andSection; 201.20(b)(3)) are also based onsalary level GS-12, step 1, which the Commission estimates is the averagestaff grade of personnel likely to be doing such computer searches or review.The proposed rules governing requests for information in cases or mattersto which the Commission is not a party specify the Commission's procedureswith respect to such requests. The proposed rules are intended to preventthe harm that may result from inappropriate disclosure of nonpublic informationor inappropriate allocation of Commission resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received not later than thirty (30) daysfrom the date that this notice appears in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 EStreet SW., Washington, DC 20436.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>William W.

Section 201.20 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 201.20 Fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general.</T3> Fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be assessed accordingto the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for servicesrendered by agency personnel in responding to and processing requests forrecords under this subpart. All fees so assessed shall be charged to therequester, except where the charging of fees is limited under paragraph(c) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted underparagraph (d) of this section. The Secretary will collect all applicablefees. Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made payable tothe Treasury of the United States. (b) <T3>Charges.</T3> In responding to requests under this subpart, the followingfees shall be assessed, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been grantedpursuant to paragraph (d) of this section:(1) <T3>Search.</T3> (i) No search fee shall be assessed with respect to requestsby educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, andrepresentatives of the news media as defined in paragraphs (j) (6), (7),and (8) of this section, respectively. Search fees shall be assessed withrespect to all other requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph(c) of this section. The Secretary may assess fees for time spent searchingeven if agency personnel fail to locate any respective record or whererecords located are subsequently determined to be entirely exempt fromdisclosure. (ii) For each quarter hour spent by agency personnel in salary grades GS-2through GS-10 in searching for and retrieving a requested record, the feeshall be $3.00. When the time of agency personnel in salary grades GS-11and above is required, the fee shall be $5.00 for each quarter hour ofsearch and retrieval time spent by such personnel. (iii) For computer searches of records, which may be undertaken throughthe use of existing programming, requester shall be charged the actualdirect costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (asdefined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be entitled to the costequivalent of two hours on manual search time without charge. These directcosts shall include the cost of operating a central processing unit forthat portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searchingfor records responsive to a request, as well as the costs of operator/programmersalary apportionable to the search (at no more than $5.00 per quarter hourof time so spent). Agency personnel are not required to alter or developprogramming to conduct a search.(2) <T3>Duplication.</T3> Duplication fees shall be assessed with respect toall requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section.For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which needbe supplied), the fee shall be $0.10 per page. For copies produced by computer,such as tapes or printouts, the Secretary shall charge the actual directcosts, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other methodsof duplication, the Secretary shall charge the actual direct costs of duplicatinga record.(3) <T3>Review.</T3> (i) Review fees shall be assessed with respect to onlythose requesters who seek records for a commercial use, as defined in paragraph(j) (5) of this section. For each quarter hour spent by agency personnelin reviewing a requested record for possible disclosure, the fee shallbe $5.00.(ii) Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record review,i.e., all of the review undertaken when a component analyzes the applicabilityof a particular exemption to a particular record or record portion at theinitial request level. No charge shall be assessed for review at the administrativeappeal level of an exemption already applied. However, records or recordportions withheld pursuant to an exemption that is subsequently determinednot to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of otherexemptions not previously considered. The costs of such a subsequent revieware properly assessable, particularly where that review is made necessaryby a change of circumstances.(c) <T3>Limitations on charging fees.</T3> (1) No search or review fee shallbe charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that periodis required for search or review. (2) Except for requesters seeking records for a commerical use (as definedin paragraph (j)(5) of this section), the Secretary shall provide withoutcharge_(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent), and(ii) The first two hours of search (or its cost equivalent). (3) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (b) of this sectionis $25.00 or less, no fee shall be charged.(4) The provisions of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section work together.For requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, nofee shall be charged unless the cost of search is in excess of two hoursplus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages exceeds $25.00. (d) <T3>Waiver or reduction of fees.</T3> (1) Records responsive to a requestunder 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reducedbelow that established under paragraph (b) of this section where the Secretarydetermines, based upon information provided by a requester in support ofa fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Secretary that disclosureof the requested information is in the public interest, because it is likelyto contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations oractivities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interestof the requester. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be consideredon a case-by-case basis.(2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met_i.e.,that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interestbecause it is likely to contributed significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government_the Secretary shall consideredthe following four factors in sequence:(i) <T3>The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested recordsconcerns ``the operations or activities of the government.''</T3> The subjectmatter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specificallyconcern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government_witha connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated. Furthermore,the records must be sought for their informative value with respect tothose government operations or activities; a request for access to recordsfor their intrinsic informational content alone will not satisfy this thresholdconsideration.(ii) <T3>The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether thedisclosure is ``likely to contribute; to an understanding of governmentoperations or activities.</T3> The disclosable portions of the requestedrecords must be meaningfully informative on specific government operationsor activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increasedpublic understanding of those operations and activities. The disclosureof information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicativeor a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute tosuch understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public record.(iii) <T3>The contribution of an understanding of the subject by the public likelyto result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested informationwill contribute to ``public understanding.'' </T3>The disclosure must contributeto the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individualunderstanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons.A requester's identity and qualifications_e.g., expertise in the subjectarea and ability and intention to effectively convey information to thegeneral public_shall be considered. It will be presumed that a representativeof the news media (as defined in paragraph (j)(8) of this section who hasaccess to the means of public dissemination readily will be able to satisfythis consideration. Requests from libraries or other record repositories(or requesters who intend merely to disseminate information to such institutions)shall be analyzed, like those of other requesters, to identify a particularperson who represents that he actually will use the requested informationin scholarly or other analytic work and then disseminate it to the generalpublic.(iv) <T3>The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public understandingof government operations or activities.</T3> The public's understandingof the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understandingexisting prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be enhanced by thedisclosure to a significant extent. The Secretary shall not make separatejudgments as to whether information, even though it in fact would contributesignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities ofthe operations or activities of the government, is ``important'' enoughto be made public.(3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement ismet_i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester_the Secretary shall considerthe following two factors in sequence:(i) <T3>The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requesterhas a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure.</T3>The Secretary shall consider all commercial interests of the requester(with reference to the definition of ``commercial use'' in paragraph (j)(5)of this section), or any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting,but shall consider only those interests which would be furthered by therequested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercialinterests, consideration shall be given to the role that such FOIA-disclosedinformation plays with respect to those commercial interests, as well asto the extent to which FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall.Requesters shall be given a reasonable opportunity in the administrativeprocess to provide information bearing upon this consideration.(ii) <T3>The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identifiedcommercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparisonwith the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester.'' </T3>A fee waiver or reductionis warranted only where, once the ``public interest'' standard set outin paragraph (d)(2) of this section is satisfied, that public interestcan fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude than that of the requester'scommercial interest in disclosure. The Secretary shall ordinarily presumethat, where a news media requester has satisfied the ``public interest''standard, that will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to thatrequester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and marketgovernment information for direct economic return shall not be presumedto primarily serve the ``public interest.''(4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of therequirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, awaiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each ofthe factors listed in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, as theyapply to each record request.(e) <T3>Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. </T3>Where the Secretarydetermines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this sectionmay amount to more than $25.00, he shall notify the requester as soon aspracticable of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requesterhas indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated.(If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Secretary shalladvise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of thetotal fee.) In cases where a requester has been notified that actual orestimated fees may amount to more than $25.00, the request will be deemednot to have been received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipatedtotal fee. A notice to the requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offerhim the opportunity to confer with agency personnel in order to reformulatehis request to meet his needs at the lower cost.(f) <T3>Aggregating requests. </T3>Where the Secretary reasonably believesthat a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attemptingto divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evadingthe assessment of fees, the Secretary may aggregate any such requests andcharge accordingly. The Secretary may presume that multiple requests ofsuch type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to evadefees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, the Secretary shallaggregate them only where there exists a reasonable basis for determiningthat said aggregation is warranted, e.g., where the requests involve clearlyrelated matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall notbe aggregated.(g) <T3>Advance payments. </T3>(1) Where the Secretary estimates that a totalfee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00, theSecretary may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amountup to the entire estimated fee before beginning to process the request,except where the Secretary receives a satisfactory assurance of full paymentfrom a requester with a history of prompt payment.(2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a records access feewithin 30 days of the date of billing, the Secretary may require the requesterto pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest (as providedfor in paragraph (h) of this section), and to make an advance payment ofthe full amount of any estimated fee before he begins to process a newrequest or continues to process a pending request from that requester.(3) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2)of this section, the Secretary shall not require the requester to makean advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is commenced or continuedon a request. Payment owed on work already completed is not an advancepayment.(4) Where the Secretary acts under paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section,the administrative time limits described in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIAfor the processing of an initial request or an appeal, plus permissibleextensions of these time limits, shall be deemed not to begin to run untilthe Secretary has received payment of the assessed fee.(h) <T3>Charging interest. </T3>The Secretary may assess interest charges onan unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which thebill was sent to the requester. Once a fee payment has been received bythe Secretary, even if not processed, the accrual of interest shall bestayed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate prescribed in section3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and shall accrue from the date of the billing.The Secretary shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of1982, Pub. L. 97-265 (Oct. 25, 1982), and its implementing procedures,including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies,and offset.(i) <T3>Other statutes specifically providing for fees. </T3>(1) The fee scheduleof this section does not apply with respect to the charging of fees undera statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particulartypes of records_i.e., any statute that specifically requires a governmententity such as the Government Printing Office or the National TechnicalInformation Service, to set and collect fees for particular types of records_inorder to:(i) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by convenientlymaking available government information;(ii) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications andother services that are for their special use so that these costs are notborne by the general taxpaying public;(iii) Operate an information-dissemination activity on a self-sustainingbasis to the maximum extent possible; or(iv) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriatefunds used to pay the costs of disseminating government information.(3) Where records responsive to requests are maintained for distributionfor agencies operating statutorily based fee schedule programs, the Secretaryshall inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from thosesources.(j) <T3>Definitions. </T3>For the purpose of this section:(1) The term ``direct costs'' means those expenditures which the agencyactually incurs in searching for the duplicating (and, in the case of commercialuse requesters, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Directcosts include, for example the salary of the employee performing the work(the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate tocover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not includedin direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space and heatingor lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.(2) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identificationof material within documents. The Secretary shall ensure, however, thatsearches are undertaken in the most efficient and least expensive mannerreasonably possible; thus, for example, the Secretary shall not engagein line-by-line search where merely duplicating an entire document wouldbe quicker and less expensive.(3) The term ``duplication refers to the process of making a copy of arecord necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take theform of payer copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readabledocumentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy providedshall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.(4) The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining a record locatedin response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of itis permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any record fordisclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise it and otherwiseprepare it for release, although review costs shall be recoverable evenwhere there ultimately is no disclosure of a record. Review time does notinclude time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding theapplication of exemptions.(5) The term ``commercial use'' in the context of a request refers to arequest from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purposethat furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requesteror the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furtheringthose interests through litigation. The Secretary shall determine, as wellas reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the recordsrequested. Where the circumstances of a request suggest that the requesterwill put the records sought to a commercial use, either because of thenature of the request itself or because the Secretary otherwise has reasonablecause to doubt a requester's stated use, the Secretary shall provide therequester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.(6) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduatehigher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, and an institution of vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. To be eligiblefor inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the requestis being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institutionand that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are soughtin furtherance of scholarly research.(7) The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (j)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for thepurpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are notintended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligiblefor inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the requestis being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institutionand that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are soughtin furtherance of scientific research.(8) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means informationthat is about current events or that would be of current interest to thepublic. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (butonly in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of ``news''who make their products available for purchases or subscription by thegeneral public. For ``freelance'' journalists to be regarded as workingfor a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expectingpublication through that organization; a publication contract would bethe clearest proof, but the Secretary shall also look to the past publicationrecord of a requester in making this determination. To be eligible forinclusion in this category, a requester also must not be seeking the requestedrecords for a commercial use. In this regard, a request for records supportingthe news dissemination function of the requester shall not be consideredto be for a commercial use.(k) <T3>Charges for other services and materials</T3>. Apart from the otherprovisions of this section, where the Secretary elects, as a matter ofadministrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special serviceor materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or sendingthem other than by ordinary mail, the actual direct costs of providingthe service or materials shall be charged.3. Section 201.21 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 201.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability of specific records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(c) <T3>Information requested in cases or matters to which the Commission isnot a party</T3>. (1) The procedure specified in this section will applyto all demands directed to Commission employees for the production of documentsor for testimony that relates in any way to the employees' official duties.These procedures will also apply to demands directed to former employeesif the demands seek nonpublic materials or information acquired duringCommission employment. The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this sectionwill also apply to demands directed to the agency. For purposes of thissection, the term ``demand'' means any request, order or subpoena for testimonyor production of documents; the term, ``subpoena'' means any compulsoryprocess in a case or matter to which the Commission is not a party; theterm ``nonpublic'' includes any material or information which, under andSection;201.21(b), is exempt from availability for public inspection and copying;the term ``employee'' means any current or former officer or employee ofthe Commission; the term ``documents'' means all records, papers or officialfiles, including without limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda,reports, studies, calendar and diary entries, graphs, notes, charts, tabulations,data analysis, statistical or information accumulations, records of meetingsand conversations, film impressions, magnetic tapes, and sound or mechanicalreproductions; the term ``case or matter'' means any civil proceeding beforea court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or other body conductinga legal or administrative proceeding in which the Commission is not a namedparty.(2) Prior to or simultaneously with a demand to a Commission employee forthe production of documents or for testimony concerning matters relatingto official duties, the party seeking such production or testimony mustserve upon the General Counsel of the Commission an affidavit, or if thatis not feasible, then a statement which sets forth the title of the case,the forum, the party's interest in the case, the reasons for the request,and a showing that the desired testimony or documents are not reasonablyavailable from any other source. Where testimony is sought, the party mustalso provide a summary of the testimony desired, the intended use of thetestimony, and show that Commission records could not be provided and usedinstead of the requested testimony. A subpoena for testimony from a Commissionemployee concerning official matters or for the production of documentsshall be served in accordance with Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of CivilProcedure and a copy of the subpoena shall be sent to the General Counsel.(3) Any employee or former employee who is served with a subpoena or otherdemand shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the service of thesubpoena or other demand, the nature of the documents or information sought,and all relevant facts and circumstances.(4) Absent written authorization from the Chairman of the Commission (``Chairman''),the employee shall respectfully decline to produce the requested documents,to testify, or to otherwise disclose requested information. If a courtrules that the demand must be complied with despite the absence of suchwritten authorization, the employe upon whom the demand is made shall respectfullyrefuse to comply based upon these regulations and <T3>Touhy </T3>v. <T3>Ragan</T3>, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).(5) The Chairman will consider and act upon subpoena under this sectionwith due regard for statutory restrictions, the Commission's rules andthe public interest, taking into account such factors as the need to conserveemployee's time for conducting official business, the need to prevent theexpenditure of the United States government's time and money for privatepurposes, the need to maintain impartiality between private litigants incases where no substantial governmental interest is involved, and the relevantlegal standards for determining whether justification exits for the disclosureof nonpublic information and documents. If the Chairman determines thatthe subpoena documents or information are protected by a privilege or thatthe Commission has a duty in law or equity to protect such documents orinformation from disclosure, the General Counsel shall move the court toquash the subpoena or for other appropriate action.(6) The General Counsel may consult or negotiate with counsel or the partyseeking testimony or documents to refine and limit the demand so that complianceis less burdensome, or obtain information necessary to make the determinationdescribed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Failure of the counsel orparty seeking the testimony or documents to cooperate in good faith toenable the General Counsel to make an informed recommendation to the Chairmanunder paragraph (c)(5) of this section may serve as the basis for a determinationnot to comply with the demand. (7) Permission to testify will, in all cases, be limited to the informationset forth in the affidavit as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,or to such portions thereof as the Chairman deems proper.(8) If the Chairman authorizes the testimony of an employee, then the GeneralCounsel shall arrange for the taking of the testimony by methods that areleast disruptive of the official duties of the employee. Testimony may,for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, writtendepositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by anyother means allowable by law. Costs of providing testimony, including transcripts,wil be borne by the party requesting the testimony. Such costs shall alsoinclude reimbursing the Commission for the usual and ordinary expensesattendant upon the employee's absence from his or her official duties inconnection with the case or matter, including the employee's salary andapplicable overhead charges and any necessary travel expenses.(9) The Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel is further authorizedto charge reasonable fees to parties demanding documents or information.Such fees, calculated to reimburse the government for the expense of respondingto such demand, may include the costs of time expended by Commission employeesto process and respond to the demand, attorney time for reviewing the demandand for related legal work in connection with the demand, and expensesgenerated by equipment used to search for, produce and copy the responsiveinformation. In general, such fees will be assessed at the rates and inthe manner specified in andSection; 201.20 of this part.(10) This section does not affect the rights and procedures governing thepublic access to official documents pursuant to the Freedom of InformationAct or the Privacy Act.(11) This section is intended to provide instructions to Commission employeesand does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceableby any party against the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued: January 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kenneth R.
