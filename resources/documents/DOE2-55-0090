The recent slowdown in the growthof water demand for agricultural and energy production has provided anopportunity to reassess economic, social and environmental realitiesof such transfers. A symposium was conducted to examine the scientificuncertainties related to interbasin transfer. Objectives of the symposiumwere to compare experiences with different kinds of interbasin transferacross Canada, including hydrological, morphological, engineering, biological,social, legal, economic, and political aspects; to review the adequacyof pre- and post-project monitoring activities in support of more comprehensiveassessment of project impacts; and to identify the data and researchneeded to improve understanding of the implications of water transferin terms of natural processes, social values, and policy alternatives.Papers were presented on the GRAND Canal Project, regional experienceswith interbasin transfer, environmental assessment, quantity modifications,water quality and environmental modifications, biological issues, andinstitutional issues. Separate abstracts have been prepared for ten papersfrom this symposium.</TEXT></DOC>
