The energy concern attributed the increase to &quot;greatlyimproved oil production through exploration and acquisitions,higher oil prices and a lot more wells on stream,&quot; John B.Ashmun, chairman, said in a interview.</LP><TEXT>   Per-share profit for the quarter is expected to be about1.4 cents, compared with less than one cent in the earlierperiod. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled about $16.2 million,up from $10.7 million.   Wainoco said it expects to report a net loss of about $2.8million, or 14 cents a share, for all of 1990, compared withnet income of $1.8 million, or nine cents a share, in theprior year. Results for 1990 include a $7.2 millionfirst-quarter write-down of oil and gas properties. Revenueis estimated to have increased about 25%, to roughly $50million from $39.9 million in 1989.   Wainoco said it increased oil production by about 31% lastyear, to 832,000 barrels of oil, compared with 637,000barrels for all of 1989. Natural gas production remainedabout flat at 20.2 billion cubic feet.   The company said it is gearing up to increase dailyproduction -- specifically oil production -- in anticipationof shortages from a possible Persian Gulf war. It currentlyproduces about 3,500 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feetof natural gas daily. Plans call for the incremental increaseto about 5,000 barrels of oil and possibly 75 million cubicfeet of natural gas daily by 1992, Mr. Ashmun, who is alsochief executive officer, said.   The company said that increased oil production and higherprices will also help counter chronically low natural gasprices. About 78% of the company's total reserves are naturalgas.   &quot;We prefer oil properties and are trying to steer moretoward that,&quot; Mr. Ashmun said of the company's currentacquisition and growth strategy, &quot;but we wouldn't shy awayfrom the purchase of a strategic gas reserve.&quot;   A major portion of Wainoco's planned 1991 capital spendingof about $33 million is earmarked for exploration andproduction primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the AustinChalk formation in Gonzales, Texas. The company recentlycompleted a 2,226 barrel-a-day well in the Austin Chalk.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          WAINOCO OIL Corp. expects to report fourth-quarter netincome of 14 cents a share, compared with 4.5 cents a share ayear earlier.
