SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State James A. Baker III favorssending a special envoy to the Afghan rebels battling theSoviet-backed Kabul regime as a means of broadening U.S. influenceamong the long-feuding rebel factions, administration officials saidSaturday.   ``It is under consideration,'' a White House official said of theproposal.   The official, who spoke on condition his name not be used, saidthe proposal ``is still on Baker's desk'' and has not reachedPresident Bush.   But Baker ``may be close to a decision point'' on the matter, theofficial said.   One State Department official, who also spoke privately, said theproposal has been ``under consideration for a long time,'' but saidhe was uncertain of the potential timing for a decision.   The first official emphasized that the move would not imply U.S.recognition of any interim government established by the rebels,also known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.   He confirmed the move is aimed at limiting Pakistan's influenceamong the Afghan guerrillas, in particular it's backing of radicalMoslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions.   Throughout the war, the United States has funneled aid to therebels through Pakistan.   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help fight aninsurgency that began after a communist coup in 1978. The Red Armywithdrew under an agreement mediated by the United Nations.   In recent weeks, the Soviet-backed Afghan government has beenbattling a renewed offensive by the Moslem rebels in the wake of themid-February withdrawal of the Soviet Union's 115,000 soldiers.   But last week the Soviets renewed arms shipments to Kabul, sayingthey will continue to supply equipment to President Najib's troopsas long as Pakistan and the United States supply the guerrillas.   Civil war has ravaged Afghanistan for more than 11 years anddivisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting. Theseven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based inPakistan, but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle forpower as they attempt to form a transitional regime leading to apostwar Islamic republic of Afghanistan.   Last year, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., pushed a law throughCongress that required the appointment of a special ambassador, butformer Secretary of State George Shultz only named a lower-rankingenvoy to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan to fill the post.   On Friday, the Senate renewed the call for a higher-levelappointment in a bipartisan resolution.   The resolution, which was referred to the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, also said the United States should not cut theamount of military equipment it gives the Afghan guerrillas until itis ``absolutely clear'' that the Soviet Union has ended itsassistance to its proxies.   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., authored the resolution, which wassigned by Senate majority leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, andSenate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., among others.</TEXT></DOC>
