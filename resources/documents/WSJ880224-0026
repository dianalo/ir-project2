Mr. Greenspan, in his semiannual report to Congress, said the Fed eased its grip &quot;a few weeks ago.&quot; The Fed acted, he said, because of signs of weakness in the economy earlier this year as well as the dollar's recent stability.    The bond rally gathered momentum later in the day as commodity prices tumbled. That intensified speculation that inflation will remain subdued and prompted some investment managers to predict even further declines in interest rates over the next few months.    Shortly before Mr. Greenspan began speaking early yesterday, bond prices were down slightly in extremely light activity. The rally began as soon as the first few headlines of Mr. Greenspan's testimony flashed on news wires.    Prices of some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds wound up the day with gains of about three-quarters of a point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought down the yield on the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds to 8.35% from 8.42% Monday and about 9% at the beginning of this year. Last October, as the stock market collapsed, similar bonds yielded more than 10 3/8%.    &quot;What Greenspan said has to be construed favorably over the near term&quot; for the bond market, said Robert Ried of Ried, Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn.-based investment research company. But he and many other analysts say it would be wrong to expect the Fed to take additional credit-easing steps anytime soon. They say Mr. Greenspan's testimony yesterday indicates strongly that the Fed will wait until a clearer picture of the economy's health emerges.    Mr. Greenspan's remarks swept away whatever uncertainty remained about whether a recent drop in the closely watched federal funds rate was a temporary fluke. Earlier this year, the rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, hovered between 6 3/4% and 6 7/8%. In recent weeks, the funds rate, which strongly influences many other rates, has fallen to the 6 1/2% to 6 5/8% range, and that's where traders now assume the Fed wants it to stay.    Sharp declines in commodity prices have calmed fears among many bond traders and consultants about a possible resurgence of inflation. Some even are reversing their recent bearish stance on the bond market.    &quot;Today, I have to say I'm wrong to be short&quot; bonds, said Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services, a Portsmouth, Va.-based financial consultancy. &quot;Concerns about rising inflation have been put to bed.&quot; Mr. Gartman, who became very bearish on bonds just three weeks ago, said &quot;in all probability&quot; bond prices are &quot;going higher.&quot;    The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices dropped yesterday to its lowest level in more than three months. The index fell 2.68 points to 227.18.    Mr. Greenspan yesterday said there are &quot;very few signs we're about to trip over&quot; into recession. But he also expressed concern about the possibility that shock waves from last October's stock market crash still could disrupt the economy. Asked by one congressman whether the possibility of recession or renewed inflation is the greater risk right now, the Fed chairman replied: &quot;At the moment, I would conclude the dangers are roughly equal.&quot;    However, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., contends that recession is a much greater risk. He says the economy will be so weak that some interest rates will fall by about one percentage point by yearend. For example, he predicts that banks will lower their prime, or base, lending rate, which now is 8 1/2%, to 8% by midyear and 7 1/2% by the end of the year.    Investors &quot;are taking all the pieces of the puzzle, putting them together, and they see additional monetary ease because of a soft economy&quot; later this year, Mr. Kellner said.    Mr. Greenspan's remarks early yesterday &quot;really started the ball rolling&quot; in the bond markets, said James R. Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.    But Mr. Capra cautioned against expecting any additional credit-easing moves by the Fed &quot;unless the next series of economic releases are considerably weaker than the market consensus.&quot; He said the most important government statistics will be the February employment report to be released March 4 by the Labor Department and February retail sales to be released in mid-March by the Commerce Department.    &quot;We are not in a recession and the dollar still is under pressure,&quot; Mr. Capra said. Also, &quot;the inflation picture isn't bad, but it's not clear yet.&quot;    Peter P. Kozel, senior vice president at Shawmut Bank in Boston, has lowered his inflation forecast for this year but still doesn't expect further large declines in interest rates. Late last year, he thought inflation would be in the 4.5% to 5% range.    Now, Mr. Kozel expects inflation this year to hover in the 3 1/2% to 4% range. He also expects yields on 10-year Treasury notes, now 8.17%, to drop to as low as 8% and then range between 8% and 9% the rest of the year. He disagrees with those who expect a recession, saying: &quot;I think the economy is doing pretty well.&quot;    In the long-term bond market, the Treasury's 8 7/8% issue due in 2017 rose to a price of 105 23/32 from 104 30/32 Monday. The yield fell to 8.35% from 8.42%. The government's 8 1/8% notes due in 1998 rose to 99 22/32 from 99 10/32 Monday, while the yield fell to 8.17% from 8.23%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., rose 8.97 points to 1320.44. Its high for the day was 1323.15, while the low was 1306.15.    Among short-term rates, the latest three-month Treasury bills were quoted late yesterday at 5.62% bid. That was down slightly from an average rate of 5.64% at Monday's auction by the government. The rate on six-month bills fell to 5.77% from an auction average of 5.83%.    The federal funds rate averaged about 6.65% yesterday. That was down from 6.77% Monday. The unexpectedly high funds rate Monday contributed to whatever lingering doubts there may have been among traders about whether the Fed had eased its credit grip.    The Fed yesterday intervened in the credit markets to inject reserves into the banking system, arranging $1.5 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a &quot;customer.&quot; In a repurchase agreement, the Fed buys securities from dealers, thus injecting additional funds into the banking system, while the dealers agree to buy them back at a later date. The Fed doesn't identify its customers, which usually are foreign central banks. At the time of the Fed intervention, the funds rate was 6 11/16%. </TEXT></DOC>
