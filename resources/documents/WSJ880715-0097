Though most Democrats predict a harmonious conclusion, the Dukakis forces face a dilemma: either spend most of next week trying to placate Jackson or face embarrassing TV coverage. Dukakis is likely to be cool to Jackson's idea of Carter as an intermediary, but Jackson campaign chief Brown nixes party chairman Kirk: &quot;It's hard to be a mediator when you've publicly introduced the ticket.&quot;    Party professionals debate whether the failure to call about Bentsen was due to bumbling or arrogance. Brown says the excuse that Jackson was on an airplane is &quot;lame.&quot; Dukakis adviser Brountas apologized to Jackson yesterday, but he still complains &quot;my constituency has no place on the team.&quot; The slight strengthens firebrands in the Jackson camp.    GOP analyst Kevin Phillips contends the rift with Jackson can be a plus for Dukakis by showing that &quot;Democrats don't cater to minorities.&quot;    PRESSURE GROWS on the Fed to do more to push up interest rates.    Despite Chairman Greenspan's indications this week of more tightening, critics contend it may not be enough. &quot;We have gone past the point of no return&quot; on inflation, says First Boston economist Albert Wojnilower. Even some regional Fed presidents urge a tighter policy. Democratic Sen. Proxmire accuses Greenspan of holding back to help GOP election chances.    But Greenspan says interest-rate rises over the past four months &quot;seemed to improve market confidence that inflationary excesses would be avoided.&quot; And liberal Princeton economist Alan Blinder says the Fed &quot;has done a quite splendid job.&quot; Fed officials hope for signs soon that the economy is slowing, which would cool the need for further rate increases.    AMERICA'S VIEW: No mea culpas on Iran, cynicism on defense procurement.    A new national Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that 48% oppose offering money to families of the Iran Air victims, while only 41% approve. Seven out of 10 Americans think the captain of the Vincennes acted properly, 72% approve of U.S. patrols in the Persian Gulf, and only 25% think the U.S. is as much at fault as the Soviets were for shooting down KAL 007.    The defense-procurement scandal is seen as only the tip of the iceberg: 72% feel the leaking of confidential bidding information is common, rather than an isolated occurrence. And a majority believe offending companies should be barred from future contracts, even if they are best equipped to make the weapons.    But 55% oppose having the government itself operate weapons factories.    JFK WINS: The Journal/NBC News poll finds that 34% of Americans cite John F. Kennedy -- twice as many as for the runnerup, Harry Truman -- as the most effective post-war president. Reagan places third with 14%, but the poll finds him especially strong among young voters, where he runs a close second to Kennedy.    PRIORITIES? Jackson wasn't the only vice presidential possibility not to get timely notification of the Bentsen selection. Glenn heard the news on his car radio, and Hamilton learned from a reporter. But the Dukakis campaign notified some fat contributors shortly after Bentsen was told.    HOLD THE MUSTARD: Colorado Rep. Schroeder gets a telegram from an SBA official in Denver opposing an increased minimum wage with wording identical to telegrams from fast-food operators. In a letter of rebuke to the SBA, she asks: &quot;Is the SBA a fast-food franchise? Will the SBA be laying off french fryers if the minimum wage is increased?&quot;    SLOW GOING: More than a month after announcing an inquiry into Speaker Wright's book royalties and other activities, the House Ethics Committee still hasn't begun questioning key witnesses. Republicans accuse the panel of stalling to avoid embarrassing Wright at the Democratic convention. Others blame bureaucratic plodding.    SOUTHERN EXPOSURE? U.S. officials worry about a leftward tilt in Mexico.    Despite President Salinas's claims to the contrary, he may have to mollify leftist election rival Cardenas. U.S. officials fear Salinas will be forced to compromise on the tough economic-reform program that has won praise from the U.S. but criticism from Cardenas. Cardenas also backs supplying Nicaragua with oil to counter the U.S. effort to wreck Managua's economy.    But instability isn't anticipated in Mexico, even though its government &quot;is going to be very nervous for a while,&quot; says CIA Director Webster. He doesn't see any openings for the Communists. And Mexico isn't expected to halt its economic reforms totally or to default on debt service.    For the long term, some State Department officials call Mexico's newfound political pluralism &quot;a very positive development.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Convention-going show-biz celebrities including Willie Nelson, John Denver and Dukakis's Oscar-winning cousin, Olympia Dukakis, will get a political briefing in Atlanta from heavyweight newspaperman Jack Germond. . . . Wags suggest one reason Dukakis didn't phone Jackson with the Bentsen news: The frugal governor didn't want to pay for the long-distance call. . . . Dry humor: A Minnesota farm official says of the drought, &quot;This is the first time we've had corn knee-high twice -- once on the way up and once going down.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
