(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Old Glory is a source of noisepollution and has to come down at night, health officials say, butThomas ``Ski'' Demski calls that demand unpatriotic and has raisedanother flag to say ``Don't Tread On Me.''   Demski, 57, flies a large American flag from a 132-foot flagpoleoutside his home day and night. But neighbors have been complainingthey can't sleep because of the flapping noise.   Recent noise-meter measurements by city health officials foundthe flag exceeded legal limits for residential areas. They orderedDemski to take his flag down every night at 10 p.m.   But despite his neighbors' objections and the city order, Demskisays he won't strike the colors. Instead, he hoisted theRevolutionary War-era banner that reads ``Don't Tread On Me.''   ``When they start picking on the flag, I'll go to jail over itif necessary,'' said the bumper sticker manufacturer, who hasexpressed interest in becoming mayor of Long Beach, 25 miles southof downtown Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
