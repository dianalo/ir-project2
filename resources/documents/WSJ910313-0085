Chase posteda loss of $334 million, or $3.31 a share, last year and aloss of $665 million, or $7.94 a share, in 1989.Manufacturers Hanover posted a modest profit of $139 million,or $1.27 a share, last year and a loss of $518 million, or$10.21 a share, in 1989. Citicorp had net income of $458million, or 99 cents a share, last year, down from $498million, or $1.16 a share, in 1989.   Chase's other top executives also took pay cuts. Arthur F.Ryan, who was promoted from vice chairman to president lastyear, saw his cash compensation fall 26% to $520,000 from$708,200 in 1989. Cash compensation for Richard J. Boyle andRobert R.

Miller, vice chairman, received bonuses lastyear. Manufacturers, in fact, changed the format of itscompensation table in the proxy statement to make it clearthat the top three executives didn't receive bonuses.   Mr. Johnson, who was paid $500,000 to join Manufacturersfrom Chemical Banking Corp. in December 1989, was paid$666,305 in salary last year. Mr. Miller's salary increasedto $485,089 last year from $394,561 in 1989, but his totalcompensation fell 33% to $533,059 from $799,834, largelyreflecting the elimination of his bonus.</TEXT></DOC>
