He was 94.   Matsushita had been in poor health and was admitted toMatsushita Memorial Hospital in Osaka on April 5 for treatment of acold, a company official said.   Quitting school at age 10 to go to work, Matsushita remainedfaithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest ofnine children in Wakayama in western Japan.   He built his global electronics empire from an electric socketbusiness he began in 1918.   The company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries,with brands including Panasonic, National, Quasar and Technics.Sales totaled $30.3 billion in the fiscal year ending in March.   ``I have many memories of him,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshitasaid today. ``He was like a god.''   ``I have simply done common things commonly well, doing what Ishould do and abstaining from what I should not,'' Matsushita oncewrote. ``In short, I have lived my daily life at the dictates ofcommon sense.''   Later in life, he espoused a philosophy of ``peace and happinessthrough prosperity,'' a kind of benevolent capitalism he preachedthrough his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with acirculation of 1.5 million. His views were criticized, however, asbeing a religion of worldly interests.   Born Nov. 27, 1894, Matsushita grew up in a well-to-doenvironment but was forced to quit school and work after hisfather, a farmer, lost the family fortune speculating in ricefutures.   After apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoal-burning stovesand a bicycle maker, Matsushita began working for the OsakaElectric Light Co. in 1910. He stayed there seven years, until hequit to begin his electric socket business with his wife, Mumeno,and her brother.   As an inventor, Matsushita registered more than 100 patents. Hisfirst was for a successful two-way socket he invented whileconfined to home because of poor health.   Centering around consumer appliances, his Osaka-based company'sproducts ranged from television sets, washing machines andrefrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens.   Matsushita was known in the business world for hisunconventional ideas, such as turning assembly line workers intodoor-to-door salesmen during a 1974 recession, and once advocatingthat Japan bulldoze 20 percent of its mountains to providereclaimed land for the crowded nation.   He received honorary degrees from several of Japan's mostprestigious universities, and, in 1979 started his own school ofgovernment and business.   He wrote more than 50 books, including a 1975 best-seller titled``How to Rescue Crumbling Japan,'' and received one of the Japanesegovernment's highest honors, the Order of the Rising Sun FirstClass, as well as medals and honors from the Netherlands, Belgium,Spain, and Malaysia.   Matsushita is survived by his wife, Mumeno, 93, and daughter,Sachiko, 68. The daughter's husband, Masaharu Matsushita, 76, wasadopted into the family and now is the company chairman.   A Matsushita official said funeral services would be held Sundayat Honganji Tsumura Betsuin Temple in Osaka, western Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
