The method of images is used to calculate the diamagneticbuoyancy force exerted by this interaction on an individual flux rope.The results show that the presence of an external magnetic field enablesthe ambient magnetic stress to give rise to an attractive force betweenthe two legs of a bipolar arch in the lower solar corona. This providesa dynamical explanation for the photospheric observation that two magneticfeatures of opposite polarities can move toward each other. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
