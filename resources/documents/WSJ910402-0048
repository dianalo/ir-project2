The report surprised grain traders because many analystshad expected the government to report that U.S. soybeanacreage would increase by about 400,000 acres.</LP><TEXT>   Amid heavy buying on the part of commodity fund managers,the price of the soybean contract for May delivery jumped23.75 cents a bushel to settle at $5.985.   A department survey found that farmers intend to plant57.1 million acres of soybeans this spring, down about700,000 acres from the spring of 1990. Many crop analysts hadbeen expecting the government to project that soybean farmerswould actually increase their soybean acreage to 58.2 millionacres.   According to Bill Biedermann, vice president of researchat Allendale Inc., Crystal Lake, Ill., the low price ofsoybeans and weak export demand apparently damped farmerinterest in soybeans.   Just months ago, prospects for U.S. soybean productionwere much brighter. Many traders thought that soybeans wouldbe one of the crops that farmers would turn to in the wake ofCongress's decision to give participants in price-supportprograms more flexibility to decide which crops to plant.   During the debate in Washington, some grain analystspredicted that farmers would plant roughly three million moreacres of soybeans. Although the crop replenishes the soilwith nitrogen -- an important fertilizer -- many farmershadn't taken full advantage of it. Other crops such as cornwere financially safer to plant because their prices wereheavily supported by the government.   The report was released late Thursday. Because futuresexchanges were closed on Friday, traders yesterday got theirfirst chance to react to the report.   Many traders still expect farmers to plant more acres.Because of complicated changes in the farm program, theAgriculture Department is allowing farmers until late thismonth to decide whether to participate in its price-supportprograms. Usually the application period ends in March.   As a result, many farmers are studying weather and exportmarkets for as long as possible before deciding whether toplant some of the major crops supported by the government,said Daniel W. Basse, director of market research atAgResource Co., Chicago.   The government is slated to update its planting report inJune.   Corn prices also jumped yesterday because of the plantingreport. The government projected that corn farmers willincrease their acreage to 76.1 million acres from the 74.2million planted last spring. Most traders had expected thegovernment to report that corn farmers would plant 77.1million acres.   If the acreage estimate is accurate, U.S. corn stockpilesmight fall even if yields are normal, according to sometraders. The world supply of corn is already relativelytight.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corncontract for May delivery rose 4.5 cents a bushel to settleat $2.5725.   According to traders, commodity fund managers boughtcontracts for at least 16.5 million bushels of corn and 12million bushels of soybeans.   Prices of wheat futures contracts also rose yesterday amidsigns of strong demand for wheat in livestock rations, amongother things.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum products futures pricesclosed lower in thin trading on the New York MercantileExchange. London's International Petroleum Exchange wasclosed for Easter Monday, so there were no European tradingtrends to give any direction to the U.S. session. Tradersgenerally felt that gasoline prices were lower becauserefiners have adequate supplies for current levels ofrefinery runs. May gasoline settled at 66.1 cents a gallon,off 1.55 cents from last Thursday. The Merc was closed Fridayfor Good Friday and the beginning of Passover. The softnessin gasoline pulled crude prices lower, with crude oil for Maydelivery losing 34 cents a barrel to settle at $19.29. Junecrude fell 28 cents to close at $19.20 a barrel and outermonths were lower as well.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. Gold for Junedelivery ended $3 an ounce higher at $362.40. May silverjumped 9.2 cents an ounce to $3.96. And July platinumfinished $1.50 an ounce higher at $397.10. The encouragingFebruary leading economic indicators report issued on Friday,when the Commodity Exchange was closed, contributed to therise in precious metals prices, said David Sobotka, managerof bullion trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Indicationsof an improving economy is bullish for metals with industrialuses, such as silver and platinum. A Merrill Lynch traderalso noted that the strength of the Commodity Research BureauFutures Index might signal higher inflation. Investors oftenbuy precious-metal investments as a hedge against inflation.The CRB index rose 3.15 points to 221.62. Mr. Sobotka alsopointed out that trading was thin yesterday because theLondon and Hong Kong markets were closed, so there wasn'twidespread participation in metals trading.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices rose sharply, with life-of-contracthighs set for the December-through-May &quot;new crop&quot; contracts.May and July cotton traded &quot;limit up&quot; of two cents a pound,ending at 83.82 cents and 84.11 cents, respectively. ThomasMueller, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, attributed the risein old-crop prices to short-covering. Investors cover shortpositions -- bets that prices will fallby buying offsettingcontracts. Investors took short positions last week inresponse to &quot;a lot of innuendo and rumors in the market&quot;about sales cancellations by China and weak exports, Mr.Mueller said. The Agriculture Department's export report lateThursday did include a cancellation by China, but the 19,000bales involved was a tiny part of China's 1.35-million-baletotal commitment, of which 887,000 bales have already beenshipped, according to Carolyn Whitton, agricultural economistwith the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.Moreover, new sales to Canada, Indonesia, South Korea andTaiwan more than made up for the cancellation, she noted.New-crop prices rose on lower-than-expected acreageprojections in the Agriculture Department's plantingintentions report late Thursday, Mr. Mueller said. Farmersintend to plant 14 million acres of cotton this year; thatwas up substantially from the 12.4 million acres planted lastyear, but less than the 14.7 million that was anticipated byfarmers in a preliminary report in February. Ernest Simon, acotton specialist at Prudential Securities, estimated a totalnew crop of 16.79 million bales, based on the revised acreageprojection. That might mean ending stocks in 1992 will stillbe below the four million bales the government has designatedas normal stock levels, Mr. Simon said.</TEXT></DOC>
