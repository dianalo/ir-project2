Ferguson</HL><DATE>01/16/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11</SO><LP>   A title like &quot;The Rise of Selfishness in America&quot; (OxfordUniversity Press, 308 pages, $24.95) inspires visions ofBeltway analyst Kevin Phillips or a report by a disgruntledpeople's lobby. But this work by jazz historian James LincolnCollier is not primarily about trickle-down economics and themarket process, of which he knows very little. The liberalMr. Collier's focus here is centrally cultural-an ode toVictorianism, whose ideal of self-restraint he findsoverwhelmed today by a quest for self-gratification.   This represents more than simply one intellectual'shistorical case for modesty, family and temperance, however.Mr. Collier's work is the latest in a succession ofreconsiderations of old-time virtues and standards byprogressivist politicians and academics. &quot;Responsibility&quot; and&quot;obligation&quot; are on the lips of the left, just as they remainthe stock of the social right.</LP><TEXT>   Thus is made a communitarian coalition that could alterthe ideologies of American politics. It is possible that byNovember 1992, the countercultural socialists who made suchan easy national target for the Reaganites of the 1980s willhave been transmogrified into faux-traditionalists capable ofappealing to a morally exhausted and financially spentnation. Will the yuppie financier become the San FranciscoDemocrat of the day?   Perhaps, but this budding movement against licentiousnesshas its weaknesses, and they are evident in Mr. Collier'sbook. Although he is chary to acknowledge it, many of thosehe holds accountable for the ultimate collapse of manners andmoresmen like John Dewey -- were always suspect on the right.Yet Mr. Collier, while disapproving of what liberals havewrought, cannot part with their company. He is continuallyquoting sources, such as the Kinsey Reports, that fewconservatives would accept as authority. One weird sidestephas him lending a sympathetic ear to the designers of anearly sex-education program in Anaheim, Calif., in the 1960s.(In the process he wrongly places the headquarters of theJohn Birch Society in Orange County.)   Mr. Collier will admit, on the other hand, that he hasproblems with the Victorians, that he does not wish the wholeera upon us again. Prudery, moral hypocrisy and &quot;theidealization of women&quot; were too much. But in holding up themiddle class of 1830-1912 as model in many ways, he must cometo grips, at least selectively, with the forces of modernismthat brought about the end of that era.   Ideological tensions keep arising because Mr. Collierbelieves in activist government as a check on benightedness.He thinks Americans pay too little in taxes, allowcorporations to escape too easily their duty to employees(time off, e.g.), and foster criminality by not funding asmorgasbord of social programs. Although he accepts thatindividual volition is necessary for change (just as dogovernors who are now imposing behavior checklists on welfarerecipients), he doesn't have much sense of the limits, indeedthe perversities, of state power.   But that is a sidelight on the book, which in the main isa grand exposition of a &quot;seduction&quot; from self-improvement toself-indulgence over two centuries. Mr. Collier sees a riseof rectitude as a response to the (little remembered)&quot;18th-Century Debauch.&quot; He describes resettlement houses,anti-drunkenness campaigns and other progressivist measuresthat sought to keep people on the straight and narrow duringthe 19th century, which brings him dolefully to the undoingof &quot;thrift, sobriety and industry&quot; through amusements (firstvaudeville and avantgarde arts and letters, then radio,movies, TV and sports, with gambling and prostitutionprevalent throughout).   The results: more smoking, drinking, venereal disease,drugs, abuse of all kinds. Even the Depression was littlehelp in stemming the rising tide of carnality. World War IIand the Ike years offered some surcease, but soon the greatprosperity of the 1960s led to the pivotal year 1973. Thatyear, Mr. Collier finds, the dissoluteness of the beats andthe hippies and all the tempters of decades past -- oddlycombined with the institutionalized greed of what he regardsas a right-wing political order -- finally broke through tomainstream America.   &quot;Do your own thing&quot; sounded the knell for the lastVictorian remnants. Divorce is a Collier benchmark for theendless pursuit of something better for one's self. In hisview, fatherless families epitomize the abasement of a goodsociety. Although, again weirdly, he quotes feminist BarbaraEhrenreich, Mr. Collier has profound problems withcontemporary feminism. He dodges the abortion issue, but cutsto the quick of the working-couple ethos: He says householdsdon't need two incomes except to afford niceties theycouldn't have had a generation ago, and (referring mainly towomen) dismisses the notion that most work roles are&quot;careers&quot; that can't simply be dropped to raise kids.   Yet, if coarseness is still too often customary, if partsof society continue their plunge into depravity (to the boomand leer of MTV), there are glimmers of hope that suggest Mr.Collier is too funereal when he concludes, &quot;Liberty weeps tosee what we have done with her gift.&quot; Grudging signs ofself-restraint -- as opposed to ostentation, promiscuity andsloth -- are appearing in the larger population. The authormay not concede them, because he waits for politics tochange, too. Maybe his work suggests, in spite of itself,that other things matter more.   ---   Mr. Ferguson writes the Journal's Business World column.</TEXT></DOC>
