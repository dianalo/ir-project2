Endara, in the 16th day of a hunger strike, was not caught,Willie Cochez said. ``He is now in a safe place.''   Cochez would not say how Endara was able to leave his officebefore the soldiers arrived.   A residents living nearby said two truckloads of soldierssurrounded the block, stopped traffic and then entered thebuilding. The resident, who declined to be identified by name, saidsoldiers had taken Endara out.   Newsmen were kept about 200 yards away from the scene.   ``Keep moving the other way,'' two policemen told AP newsmen atthe scene.   Associated Press photographer John Hopper was hit on the headand his equipment was confiscated. The wound required stitches.   Endara, who was in the 16th day of the hunger strike to promotea boycott of payments to the government, was on the main floor in awide corner room with plate glass inside walls.   Several hours earlier, eight gunmen had fired in the air outsidethe office where Endara was staying, dispersing scores ofsupporters gathered outside. Still earlier in the day, uniformedtroops and civilians had surrounded the building.   Some of the gunmen entered Endara's office and took hissecretary with them, but the secretary was later released.   The former opposition presidential candidate told reportersearlier Thursday he would continue his hunger strike as part of acampaign to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Noriega survived a coup attempt Tuesday, and in a televisedspeech Thursday he said he had evidence the United States plannedto install Endara as president after the coup.   ``This hunger-striking buffoon sneaks out to eat (Tuesday) so hecan be well fed when he takes over the presidency. But he'sscrewed,'' Noriega said.   Noriega said he was going to present his hand-picked provisionalpresident, Francisco Rodriguez, with a package of ``war laws''dealing with security because Panama is living ``in a moment ofemergency.''   Noting that U.S. troops stood by and watched as the rebellionfailed, Noriega said the United States ``left its agents in thelurch.'' He said the bungled coup was another Bay of Pigs for theUnited States, referring to the CIA-supported invasion of Cuba thatfailed in 1961.   ``They mistakenly believed that everyone has a price and thateveryone is a traitor,'' he said the speech from the provincialtown of Santiago.   The civilian opposition and the United States have denied anyrole in the coup attempt.   The United States recognizes Endara as the legitimate presidentbecause of his victory in May 7 elections that were annulled byNoriega.   Endara was drinking only water, taking prescribed medicine andeating only the wafer of Mass, but he appeared healthy whenreporters interviewed him at his office.   Accusations of bungling the coup attempt were flying inWashington, where congressional leaders accused the Bushadministration of botching the coup attempt.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the coup leader, Maj. MoisesGiroldi Vega, had been executed.   ``I have received reports from Panama that Noriega personallyshot the major,'' said Helms.   Noriega didn't mention any executions in his speech, but thePanamanian Defense Forces said nine of the 10 rebels who died inthe aborted coup were officers. The Wednesday night communique saidno loyalist troops died.   ``Here we have a new Bay of Pigs,'' Noriega said. ``They (theUnited States) left its agents in the lurch and nothing wasaccomplished because dignity is superior to brute force.''   Noriega said he had come under heavy fire in Defense Forcesheadquarters during the coup attempt Tuesday and described talkingto the coup leaders. He did not give details of the situationinside the barracks.   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon said Thursday that Noriega had beentaken hostage. Other sources said Noriega had taken refuge in abunker and managed to call for help.   Noriega described the rebel officers as ``confused'' and saidthey were led by members of the general staff ``who were totallysuborned, confused but traitors.''   ``I told them they would have to kill me before I handed overthe national liberation movement of the Panamanian people,'' hesaid.   Noriega maintains he is the victim of a U.S. plot to renege onthe 1977 treaties that turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at theend of the century. Noriega said he had advance knowledge of a coupplot.   More than 35 officers and soldiers, including three members ofNoriega's general staff, were arrested, the Panamanian DefenseForces said. They said five rebels have taken refuge at a U.S.military base.   Southern Command and the U.S. Embassy have refused to commentabout the five who reportedly sought asylum, or about anythingelse, since Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
