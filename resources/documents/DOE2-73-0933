In this study, we examined the mechanismsof vessel destruction by determining the effects of laser irradiationon three types of primary target cells--erythrocytes, endothelial cells,and fibroblasts. Human endothelial cells and fibroblasts in microwellplates were irradiated at various energy densities with the laser, afterwhich several aspects of cellular biology were determined, including1) viability of cells by trypan blue exclusion test; 2) cell proliferationby [3H]thymidine incorporation; and 3) rate of protein synthesis using[3H]leucine incorporation as a marker. In endothelial cell cultures,both [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporations were inhibited at energylevels of 5-12 J/cm2 (P less than 0.01). In fibroblast cultures, cellproliferation was similarly inhibited, while supratherapeutic energydensity (greater than or equal to 12 J/cm2) was required for inhibitionof protein synthesis. The laser energy in the range of 5-8.5 J/cm2 hadno effect on cell viability. Erythrocytes as target cells for laser energydemonstrated rapid, dose-dependent lysis, as determined by release offree hemoglobin into culture medium. Addition of erythrocytes into acoculture with endothelial cells abolished the direct inhibitory effectnoted in cultures when endothelial cells were present alone. The resultsof the latter experiment imply that erythrocytes are the primary targetcell absorbing the laser energy at 577 nm. However, direct laser effectson endothelial cells may also contribute to the mechanisms of ablationof the vascular ectasias by the tunable dye laser at 577 nm.</TEXT></DOC>
