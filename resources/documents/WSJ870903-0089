Gray, the former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was named president and chief operating officer of Chase Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a South Florida mutual thrift with $1.7 billion in assets.    Chase Federal has no connection with Chase Manhattan Corp.    As president, Mr. Gray succeeds Charles L. Clements Jr., who remains Chase's chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Gray's term as chairman of the Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, expired June 30. After his term ended, he used a room at the Bank Board in Washington as a base from which to find a job. As reported, his use of the room is being investigated by the federal Office of Government Ethics. Asked about that inquiry, Mr. Gray said:&quot;I don't put any stock in that. I can't imagine I used it (the room) more than 12 hours in total.&quot;    Mr. Gray declined to disclose his pay at his new job, except to say he will be making &quot;a lot more than I was.&quot;    He said he will maintain homes in Miami and in the San Diego area, where he was employed by a thrift before becoming Bank Board chairman in May 1983. </TEXT></DOC>
