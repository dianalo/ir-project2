Gordon Crovitz's Jan. 2 Rule of Law column,&quot;War Is Too Serious to Be Left to the Judges&quot;: We are not nowin a state of war. The U.S. has not been attacked. Iraq doesnot threaten us. Iraq's troops clearly are in defensivepositions. The Constitution, Article I, section 8, requiresCongress to declare war if our troops are to lawfully attackanother country that has not first attacked us. A vote of theU.N. cannot bypass our Constitution.   Clear evidence of this offensive/defensive distinction isin the congressional reference work &quot;The U.S. ConstitutionRevised and Annotated&quot;: &quot;In the first draft of theConstitution presented to the Convention of 1787 by itsCommittee of Detail, Congress was empowered `to make war.'&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On the floor of the convention, according to Madison'sjournal, &quot;Mr. Madison and Mr. Gerry, moved to insert`declare,' striking out `make' war; leaving to the Executivethe power to repel sudden attacks.&quot; Without Congressdeclaring war, the executive may not lawfully issue an orderto attack. The president may only repel a sudden attack.   Military officers are sworn to defend the Constitution andare briefed that they may not follow unlawful orders. I tookthe same oath and received the same Uniform Code of MilitaryJustice briefing during the Vietnam War. The Lawful/Unlawfulbriefing stems from the Nuremberg trials. If the presidentorders an attack he should be impeached. Generals andadmirals following unlawful orders should be prosecuted.   W. Bruce Charles   Bixby, Okla.</TEXT></DOC>
