It said the board on Wednesday had decided to authorize Air France to start negotiations with Boeing on an eventual order for the planes, which will be delivered starting in 1991.    The Boeing 737-500, made by Seattle-based Boeing Co., is still under development and is expected to enter into commercial service next year. The 108-seat aircraft is designed to replace the Boeing 737-200 and will be the smallest of the company's 737 series.    Air France already operates 16 Boeing 737-200s on its medium-range routes, and its air charter subsidiary owns another three planes.    Air France said one of the advantages of the new Boeing planes is that they will be powered by CFM56 engines of the same type as those used on Airbus Industrie's A320 short-to-medium haul aircraft. Air France has ordered 25 A320 planes from the European consortium.    Airbus doesn't offer a plane as small as the twin-engine 737-500, which is Boeing's smallest jetliner.    In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman said Air France's plans are &quot;very encouraging to us.&quot; He said Boeing already has nine customers for the 737-500, and will begin delivering the first of the 101 planes now on its order books in March 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
