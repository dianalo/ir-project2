Lublin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GLX MTC </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Glaxo Holdings PLC claimed its anti-ulcer drug Zantac also appears to prevent certain ulcers in patients taking anti-arthritis medicines.    The Glaxo study, published in this week's British Medical Journal, could lead to wider usage of Zantac, the world's topselling prescription medicine, by boosting its #1 billion ($1.75 billion) in annual sales another 10% to 20%, some analysts predicted. &quot;This is going to be really major for Zantac,&quot; said Erling Refsum, a pharmaceuticals-industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London. Arthritis painkillers, the most frequently prescribed type of drugs, represent &quot;a $6 billion-a-year market world-wide&quot; he added.    But these popular painkillers, known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, frequently cause stomach upset, stomach bleeding and ulcers. At the moment, there isn't an effective way to prevent such potentially fatal side effects.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering approval of G.D. Searle andamp; Co.'s Cytotec to protect arthritis patients against developing certain ulcers when they take anti-inflammatory drugs. Searle, a Skokie, Ill., unit of St. Louis-based Monsanto Co., has won British marketing clearance for this use of Cytotec, but the FDA has hesitated because Cytotec can cause diarrhea and can induce abortions.    Glaxo's research appears to be an effort to ward off the possible marketing threat posed by Searle's drug.    A spokesman for Glaxo, Britain's biggest drug maker, said &quot;it's too early&quot; to speculate on its research's market potential because &quot;other studies are needed&quot; and &quot;further work is being done.&quot; He declined to speculate on when Glaxo might ask the FDA to clear Zantac's use in preventing arthritis patients' ulcers. But once a drug has been cleared for one use in the U.S., doctors generally are within their rights to use it as they see fit.    Glaxo said its controlled study involved 263 arthritis patients at 18 medical centers in five countries -- France, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Britain.    Because Glaxo's study involved so few patients, some analysts expressed skepticism about how soon the British drug company may be able to promote Zantac's use among arthritis patients. &quot;It might increase the market by 10% over the next five years,&quot; said Eile Gibson, a drug analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in London. But it probably will be &quot;two years down the road&quot; before Glaxo wins FDA approval for the use, she added.    The Glaxo spokesman said additional research has begun involving about 300 patients at several medical centers.    In the just-completed study, participants treated with one of four types of anti-arthritis medications also received either Zantac or a placebo. Zantac appeared to offer significant protection against ulcers found in the duodenum, the portion of the small intestine connected to the stomach. Two of the 137 patients taking Zantac twice a day developed duodenal ulcers after eight weeks compared with 10 of 126 in the control group, the Glaxo report said.    But &quot;there was no signficant difference between the groups in the incidence of gastric ulceration&quot; or stomach ulcers, the report said. Eight patients taking Zantac and seven patients in the control group developed stomach ulcers. Searle has sought U.S. marketing clearance for protection solely against stomach ulcers.    If the FDA approves Zantac's wider use, Glaxo may be able to keep the drug's growth rate from slowing as quickly as expected. Zantac's share of the world market for ulcer medications was 42% in fiscal 1988 ended June 30, up from 40% a year ago. But it is facing increased competition from the introduction of similar drugs by Merck andamp; Co. and Eli Lilly andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
