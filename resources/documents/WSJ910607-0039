But yesterday, Mr. Tribe became an influential forcein the markets.   Traders were busy passing the word that Genetics Institutehad hired the heavy-hitting Harvard lawyer to continue itspatent battle with the biotechnology highflyer Amgen. Thespeculation, which appears to have some basis in fact, waslargely responsible for sending Amgen shares tumblingyesterday while Genetics Institute's stock rose.</LP><TEXT>   Short-sellers swarmed around Amgen and the shares closedat 117, down 4 3/4 in over-the-counter trading. In a marketthat wasn't kind to biotechnology stocks in generalyesterday, Genetics Institute shares ended at 36, up 1 5/8.   There appears to be considerable evidence to support therumors. According to people familiar with the heated patentdispute between the two biotechnology giants, Mr. Tribe onWednesday completed a legal petition that Genetics Instituteis likely to submit for consideration to the U.S. SupremeCourt early next month.   Mr. Tribe, 49 years old, declined to comment yesterday. AGenetics Institute spokeswoman wouldn't confirm that theCambridge, Mass., biotechnology company retained Mr. Tribe.She said Genetics Institute is &quot;continuing to consider itsoptions with regard to the Supreme Court and hasn't made adecision.&quot;   In March, Amgen pulled off an upset victory in along-running patent battle with Genetics Institute overrights to a new drug. A Washington appeals court's decisionblocked Genetics Institute from selling its version of ananti-anemia drug in the U.S.   The drug, erythropoietin, or EPO, has been blocked fromthe U.S. market for nearly two years, largely because of thepatent dispute. Sales of Amgen's version of the drug,launched in June 1989, are expected to reach $350 million inthe current fiscal year.   Lawyers and academic experts noted yesterday that the oddsof the high court accepting a case relating to a patentdispute aren't in Genetics Institute's favor. Many times inthe past, the Supreme Court has shunned such cases.   But these experts said the introduction of Mr. Tribe tothe Genetics Institute legal team may enhance GeneticsInstitute's chances of persuading the Supreme Court to heararguments in the case.   &quot;Once you hire a significant lawyer to represent youbefore the Supreme Court, you alter the odds on thelikelihood of your victory,&quot; says Stephen Gillers, aprofessor of law at New York University. &quot;Just coming in,Tribe upsets the scales.&quot;   Perhaps no constitutional lawyer in the nation has abetter track record with the high court than Mr. Tribe. Thelawyer, who picks his battles carefully, enjoys a 13-to-5win-loss record at the high court. In the last eight years,he has argued -- and won -- five Supreme Court casesinvolving economic issues, including Pennzoil's knockoutvictory over Texaco. That win forced Texaco into bankruptcycourt.   A spokesman for Amgen said he couldn't account foryesterday's decline in the stock. Shares of the ThousandOaks, Calif., company are down 20 points from their high of137 this year. &quot;There are no corporate developments,&quot; theAmgen spokesman said. But &quot;the biotechnology sector ingeneral is down.&quot;   A report issued late Wednesday by Stan Weinstein,publisher of the Professional Tape Reader, may have helpedfuel Amgen's stock drop. Mr. Weinstein issued what are knownas &quot;trading sell&quot; recommendations on Amgen and severalcomputer-related stocks. In the stock market a &quot;trading&quot;opinion is one that recommends a short-term, in-and-outmaneuver.   Mark Simon, a biotechnology analyst at Robertson Stephensandamp; Co., says he doubts the Supreme Court will hear the patentcase. But he says that if it does, and the appeals-courtdecision is reversed, &quot;this would represent a dramatic changein the Street's outlook for EPO and Genetics Institute&quot; --and Genetics Institute would recover the market losses itsustained the day of the ruling. That day, Genetics sharesfell 21 3/4, while Amgen rose 12.   Genetics Institute has several reasons to rue the appealscourt decision. It had hoped to get revenue both fromroyalties on U.S. sales, and from manufacturing the drug inthe U.S. for European sales.   Hiring a hotshot lawyer to submit a petition to theSupreme Court worked in at least one other case whereanalysts believed it wouldn't. In the mid-1970s, Telex hiredMoses Lasky, a well-known antitrust lawyer, after an appealscourt reversed a lower court ruling ordering IBM to pay Telex$259 million in damages. The appeals court instead orderedTelex to pay IBM $18 million. After getting Mr. Lasky'spetition for a Supreme Court hearing, IBM initiatedsettlement talks, and the case was settled without afinancial victory for either side.   It couldn't be immediately learned yesterday whatarguments Genetics Institute's Supreme Court petition wouldmake. But according to individuals familiar with the case,Mr. Tribe has crafted arguments based solely onconstitutional law, his area of expertise, rather than onpatent-law claims. Separate from the body of patent law,Article One of the U.S. Constitution protects patent grants.   Genetics Institute might argue that giving Amgen a lock onthe market for EPO would discourage Amgen from seeking toimprove the medication, and inhibit cost savings forconsumers.</TEXT></DOC>
