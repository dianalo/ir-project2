<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0213 </DOCNO><TEXT>Research was conducted to develop a general test protocol to identifythe possible deterioration of water quality as a result of leaching oftoxicants from distribution/transmission pipes and tanks during distributionand storage of potable water. The developed protocol was tested witha representative coating material normally used for corrosion inhibitionof standard steel pipes and tanks and is known to contain a large numberof compounds, some of which are suspected to be carcinogenic. The leachingapparatus of the test protocol is expected to be applicable in predictingpossible toxicant leaching from other coated and uncoated materials thatcome in contact with potable water.</TEXT></DOC>
