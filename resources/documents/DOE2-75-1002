<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-1002 </DOCNO><TEXT>The state of the art of optical transmitters, low loss fiber waveguidesand receivers in both steady state and pulsed radiation environmentsis reviewed and summarized. Emphasis is placed on the effects of irradiationon the performance of light emitting and laser diodes, optical fiberwaveguides and photodiodes. The influence of radiation-induced attenuationof optical fibers due to total dose, dose rate, time after irradiation,temperature, radiation history, photobleaching, OH and impurity content,dopand type and concentration is described. The performance of candidatecomponents of the transmission system intended for deployment in theSuperconducting Super Collider Detector and primary beam tunnel nuclearenvironment is discussed. 17 refs., 15 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
