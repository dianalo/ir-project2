(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A teacher and a dentist will face eachother in a runoff election for the City Council seat of a civilrights attorney slain by a mail bomb.   A Feb. 20 runoff election was necessary because no candidatereceived a majority of the 2,572 votes cast in Tuesday's election.Robert Robinson, an NAACP attorney, had two years left on hiscouncil term when he was slain by a mail bomb Dec. 18.   Clifford Hardwick III finished first with 920 votes. He willface Dr. Phyllis Mack, who finished second among the eightcandidates with 494 votes.   Meanwhile Tuesday, a man under investigation in the mail bombslayings last month of Robinson and a federal judge in Alabama gavesamples of his blood, saliva and hair to the FBI.   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, a 46-year-old junk dealer in Enterprisein southeast Alabama, was taken by police to a hospital, where hespent 45 minutes providing samples requested in a federal grandjury subpoena issued last week. He was then questioned at City Hallfor more than two hours.   O'Ferrell has been questioned extensively in the FBI'sinvestigation of the slayings of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of AppealsJudge Robert Vance of Birmingham and Robinson.   Similar package bombs were discovered and defused at the 11thCircuit courthouse in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., chapterof the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.   Agents have confiscated typewriters from O'Ferrell. Federalsources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the printingon letters associated with the bombs matched that on a 1988 letterO'Ferrell wrote to the 11th Circuit concerning a case he lostbefore the court.   Agents last week searched O'Ferrell's home and business andpumped out his septic tanks looking for evidence. The FBI hasrefused to say whether it found any clues, but dozens of agentsremain in southeast Alabama.   In another development, a pipe bomb mailed to a church inHouston exploded Tuesday morning, injuring Lisa Osteen, the30-year-old daughter of the pastor, the Rev. John Osteen.   Charles B. Kearney, an FBI spokesman in Houston, said there didnot appear to be any similarities between the Texas bomb and theDecember mail bombs.   However, O'Ferrell and his attorney, Paul Harden, said theHouston bombing should demonstrate that O'Ferrell, who has beenunder close scrutiny in Enterprise, had nothing to do with any ofthe attacks.   ``It's a sad state of affairs, but it does in my mind show WayneO'Ferrell, who has been in Enterprise since day one, is in no way,shape or form involved,'' Harden said.   In Savannah, about 29 percent of the District 5 voters castballots, only slightly above the average for a special election,officials said.   Councilman Willie Brown said he was disappointed by the turnout.   ``I think it's a sad commentary that on the heels of whateverybody has been praising Robbie (Robinson) for, that no one cameout to show their respect and vote for the most worthyreplacement,'' Brown said.   Funeral home operator Horace Hall, who had been endorsed byRobinson's widow, Anne, finished fourth with 201 votes.</TEXT></DOC>
