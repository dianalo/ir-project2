The protesters hurled stones at security personnel as theymarched through the streets before police dispersed them and tookfour Albanians into custody.   The incident was prompted by a change of street names in thetown near the border with Albania. The streets now bear names ofSerbian rather than Albanian notables.   The change was in line with Serbian constitutional amendmentsenacted last spring that effectively curtailed the autonomy ofKosovo, one of two provinces of Serbia, the largest Yugoslavrepublic.   Vlasi, Kosovo's former communist leader, is on trial in TitovaMitrovica on counterrevolutionary charges. He was accused ofinspiring a weeklong miners' strike and riots in the province inwhich at least 25 people died.   Vlasi said his trial was politically motivated.   Sporadic battles with riot police, now regularly posted in thestreets, have become commonplace in the province.</TEXT></DOC>
