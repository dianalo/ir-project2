A company spokesman said it hasn't yet beendetermined whether a charge will be taken in connection withthe reorganization.   The company said the reorganization was undertaken toachieve increased efficiency and to better matchboat-production capacity to reduced demand resulting from thecontinuing recession in the U.S. marine-products marketplace.   Outboard's earnings have been hurt by sharply reduceddealer and consumer demand for marine products in the U.S.,the primary market for its marine engines and boats.
