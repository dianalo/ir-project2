In the office of two pricey consultants who pick names for new products, frustration reigns amid the Latin dictionaries and racing forms they collect for inspiration. Both are bashing my candidates for a Japanese car due in 1990.    &quot;'Awakener' is a terrible name for a car. Put 'wake' in a car name and people will think, at least subconsciously, of a party with a corpse,&quot; says Frank Delano, who charges up to $75,000 for a new-product name.    I argue that &quot;Awakener&quot; suggests stirring styling and an engine responding to the turn of a key. But Larry Goldman, Mr. Delano's partner in their New York firm, also thinks customers will focus on the word &quot;wake.&quot; &quot;This name has a curse for a car,&quot; he says. &quot;It makes me think, 'Hey, I could die in my 'Awakener.'&quot;    At their invitation, I have submitted 85 names for the future car and 30 names for a perfume making its debut next year. The identities of the clients are secret. Previously, Messrs. Delano and Goldman have named hundreds of products as diverse as Honda Motor Co.'s Fourtrax off-road vehicle and Bristol-Myers Co.'s Bran Tabs laxative.    But fresh names are getting harder to find. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office expects manufacturers to register 70,000 new-product names this year, double the number in 1967. Manufacturers, who typically risk at least $20 million introducing a new retail product, are increasingly turning to outside consultants to make sure the item has a catchy name.    &quot;Great new-product names are becoming as scarce as big game,&quot; says Willard Doyle, a Chicago naming consultant. The blizzard of new products overwhelms even the consultants. Most use computers to link word fragments into new combinations. That process helps Mr. Doyle offer a bargain: 5,000 names for $5,000. &quot;But I can't guarantee them,&quot; he says.    A guarantee, among other things, requires a legal search to make sure the name isn't already taken. The courts are tough on copycats. When Parfums International, a unit of Unilever Group, introduced Elizabeth Taylor's Passion perfume last year, it was sued by Annick Goutal Inc., which makes its own Passion fragrance. A New York judge ruled that Ms. Taylor's product can't be sold in 55 &quot;first-tier&quot; stores.    Possible names from nonsense words with high-tech sounds are virtually endless. Mr. Doyle's computer, using just eight letters, can create 209 billion nonsense words, 11 billion of which could be pronounced in English.    The good old days of brainstorming, when flashy names like Mustang and Sting Ray were available, are gone. &quot;In the animal kingdom, you're pretty much down to 'Skunk' and 'Opossum,' if they fit your product,&quot; says Mr. Delano.    Variations of all the astrological signs are taken except one, says Mr. Delano. &quot;You can have 'Cancer' all to yourself.&quot;    Messrs. Delano and Goldman are among the few naming consultants who shun computers. They typically spend about a month researching a name. Mr. Delano walks several miles daily through Manhattan, searching for inspiration at bookstores, perfume counters and museums. &quot;My dream is to discover some god of Greek or Roman mythology that no one has heard of; it would make a great name for a car,&quot; he says.    Other consultants say such brainstorming is old-fashioned. &quot;The computer saves time and money,&quot; says Ira Bachrach, founder of NameLab Inc., a San Francisco consulting firm. &quot;Our way is like engineering, and theirs is more like art. They sit around hoping someone will suddenly say, 'Let's call it Jell-O.'&quot;    Brainstormers are always walking the fine line of faux pas. Laboring with Messrs. Delano and Goldman to name the new Japanese car, I suggest &quot;Sojourn&quot; -- a pleasant-sounding word that connotes travel. But the name is discovered to have unfortunate meanings in at least two foreign languages.    &quot;In French, sojourn translates to sejour, meaning to stop or stay. In German, it means halt,&quot; says Mr. Goldman, sitting with a stack of foreign dictionaries. &quot;So now you're selling a car named for stopping dead in its tracks.&quot;    They shoot down my list of names like so many lexical skeet. I suggest we call the car &quot;Enhancer,&quot; a name that suggests it's an improved model that will increase customers' driving pleasure. &quot;'Enhancer' could be some sort of sexual aid,&quot; says Mr. Goldman.    &quot;Imagine how you'll sound to a parking valet when you ask him to get your 'Enhancer,'&quot; says Mr. Delano. &quot;You might sound like a person who needs enhancement; people don't want that image.&quot;    My suggestion of &quot;Mirth&quot; intrigues them. &quot;That has mystique. I would like to see what a 'Mirth' looks like,&quot; says Mr. Goldman. He quickly sours. &quot;Whatever it is, though, it isn't solid, reliable transportation like our client's car will be. Maybe it would work for a sports car.&quot;    They acknowledge that having a picture of the new car would help -- but the vehicle is still being designed. Brainstormers often work blind. Messrs. Delano and Goldman recently supplied names for a new cigarette planned by RJR Nabisco Inc. They have since learned it will be the industry's first so-called smokeless cigarette. &quot;So we didn't know the most important thing about the product,&quot; says Mr. Delano.    The session in their office turns toward finding a name for the new perfume. To get in the mood, Mr. Delano visits Bloomingdale's perfume department. In the Christmas rush, manufacturers' representatives and store clerks are shoulder to shoulder on both sides of the counter, offering 97 brands at up to $250 an ounce. This is the market Mr. Delano's perfume client hopes to tap.    He asks the woman selling Jean Patou's Joy to describe who buys her perfume -- touted as the most expensive. She gestures as if pulling a coat snug. &quot;The classic woman with furs and jewelry,&quot; she says. &quot;That's the customer our perfume will be for,&quot; says Mr. Delano, walking back to his of fice. &quot;Our woman is elegant, or she sees herself that way. She makes maybe $100,000 a year, or her husband does.&quot;    The brainstormers spend hours clipping photos of young women from magazine advertisements for fragrances and clothing. They cover a wall with the pictures and gaze at them. &quot;Our woman wants to see her self like these women -- although she's probably 10 years older,&quot; says Mr. Goldman. &quot;She wants to brag to her friends that she wears a certain brand.&quot;    The new perfume's name must appeal to the woman, but not necessarily to her husband, says Mr. Delano. &quot;The man won't remember the name anyway. She tells him, and he looks up from his paper to say, 'Oh yeah? What'd it cost?'&quot;    The new perfume must have a name that will look right on the shelves at Neiman-Marcus. &quot;A name that will appeal at $200 an ounce even though it costs maybe $3 to make,&quot; says Mr. Goldman.    My list of 30 candidates contains 18 that are already registered. Messrs. Delano and Goldman pounce on the others:   &quot;Entice&quot; -- The &quot;en&quot; prefix reminds women of engineering, bringing to mind noisy machinery. &quot;Tice&quot; might conjure up lice, mice or ice, all disastrous images.    &quot;Foreglow&quot; -- Sounds too sexual. Also makes the wearer sound a little too easy and may cheapen the product's image.    &quot;Nitespark&quot; -- Limits image to something worn only at night.    &quot;Softspark&quot; -- &quot;Soft&quot; implies weakness. May sound watered down.    &quot;Sashay&quot; -- Too cute. Sounds like it's for a young secretary.    &quot;DeLaseure&quot; -- Too abstract. Too French.    &quot;At Risk&quot; -- Sounds like you're risking $200 an ounce.    &quot;Surfeit&quot; -- &quot;Surf&quot; connotes water and maybe watered-down.    &quot;Relinquish&quot; -- The image is power and seduction -- not surrender.    &quot;Premeditate&quot; -- Might remind the shopper of premenstrual.    &quot;Disclosure&quot; -- Too serious.    &quot;Miore&quot; -- A good possibility for a car.    They're still working on it. </TEXT></DOC>
