On September 2, 1975, and October 15, 1976, the Secretarypublished criteria in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for use in designating and prioritizing MUPs,and as appropriate, the Secretary has published subsequent designationsand dedesignations of MUPs. According to <T4>Federal Register</T4> criteria, a population must have a weighted valuescore of 62 or less to be recommended for addition to the MUP list.Section 330(b)(5), as amended by Pub.

Also, until regulationsare published to define ``local officials,'' this notice provides the vehiclefor ``local officials'' to comment on the proposed MUP designation as providedin section 330(b)(5).The Secretary has determined that it would be inappropriate to delay actingon these designations until the regulations are published.Therefore, the Secretary is seeking comments and recommendations on theseproposed designations from chief executive officers of States, local officialsof States and of the particular populations involved in the proposed designations,and from the organization which represents a majority of the communityhealth centers in each affected State.The populations which have been recommended for designation are:<ITAG tagnum="84">(1) New York</ITAG>NY-Penn Health Systems Agency is requesting that a population the Cityof Binghamton in the State of New York be designated as a Medically UnderservedPopulation (MUP).
