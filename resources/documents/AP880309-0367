(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dart Group Corp.'s decision to drop itshostile $1.03 billion takeover offer for Stop andamp; Shop Cos. marks thelatest of Dart's series of unsuccessful but profitable attempts toacquire a major retailing chain.   Dart said in a brief statement Tuesday that it would let its $37a share tender offer expire at midnight EST tonight return alltendered shares to Stop andamp; Shop stockholders.   Stop andamp; Shop, a supermarket and discount department storeoperator, said Feb. 29 it had agreed to be acquired in a $44 ashare, $1.23 billion leveraged buyout led by the investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   A Dart spokesman, who did not wish to be identified, said theLandover, Md.-based company felt it was ``uneconomic to bidfurther.''   Dart, which owns about 2.7 percent of Stop andamp; Shop's 27.9 millioncommon shares outstanding, nevertheless stands to profit from itsabortive takeover try.   Dart reportedly acquired its 730,000 Stop andamp; Shop shares atprices below $20 a share, giving them a potential pre-tax gain ofat least $17.5 million if it tendered its shares under thecompany's buyout.   Stop andamp; Shop closed at $43.50 a share Tuesday on the New YorkStock Exchange, down 12{ cents from Monday's close.   Dart, which had launched its takeover bid with a $31 a shareoffer on Feb. 1, in recent years has developed a reputation as acorporate raider that launches hostile takeover bids and laterpockets huge profits by selling its stock to another suitor or tothe target company.   Dart since 1985 has been spurned in takeover bids by severalmajor retailers, including Safeway, Beatrice Cos., SupermarketsGeneral Corp. and Dayton Hudson Corp.   The company, which owns the Crown Books and Trak Auto Partsretail chains, has maintained it wanted to acquire a major retailchain as part of its long-term strategy.   In addition to the Kohlberg Kravis buyout agreement, Dart facedanother obstacle in Stop andamp; Shop's federal lawsuit to block thehostile tender offer. Stop andamp; Shop accused Dart of failing todisclose that its purpose in making the bid was to boost the stockprice of the target company in order to make a speculative profit.   Boston-based Stop andamp; Shop owns 113 Stop andamp; Shop supermarkets and169 Bradlees discount department stores. In a leveraged buyout,investors borrow heavily to buy out a company and then pay off thedebt with the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.</TEXT></DOC>
