While wage growth has intensified during the past year, perhapsin response to a tight labor market, few analysts foresee awage-price spiral at all, and certainly not the sort that provedruinous a decade or so ago.   By March of this year, average hourly earnings were up just over4 percent from a year earlier, while the consumer price index, onemeasure of inflation, has been running in a 4 percent to 4.5percent range for about a year.   Benefits add to the total cost of wages and salaries, but evenwith these added the total increase in labor costs last year wasslightly under 5 percent, greater than inflation but only minimally.   It was very different in the 1970s, when wages played a largerole in the double-digit inflation that plagued much of the decade.   Losing faith in government's ability to restrain inflation,organized labor sought and obtained big wage increases, reasoningthat whatever increases they obtained might be erased by inflationin the following year or two.   Much of heavy industry acquiesced. Rather than holding the lineon wages, management often acceded to labor's demands, confidentthe added cost could be passed on to the consumer. Management wascorrect.   Consumers got caught up in the frenzy too. Fearing that existingprices would be higher in months to come, buyers moved up theirpurchase dates for big-ticket items. They were right: Prices werehigher; they helped make them so.   Before the inflation-recession cycle was over, interest rates,prices and unemployment at one time or another all hit double-digitlevels. It was a scene to be avoided, and for most of the timesince then it has been avoided.   In the 1980s, the attitudes of labor and management are vastlydifferent. Labor seeks security and so does management, and bothfeel it can best be obtained through stability _ through avoidanceof strikes and layoffs.   Neither had much choice. The decade began with highunemployment, which hardly is the environment for wage demands.And, faced with greater foreign competition, management wasn't in aposition to grant increases.   Helping to improve labor-management relations was a more stableeconomic environment. Learning from its mistakes of the 1970s,Federal Reserve policy has been directed at avoiding crises andretaining stability.   Unconvinced, some analysts of the economy still are watchingwages for signs of trouble, and many were surprised that wageinflation didn't erupt when unemployment dropped below 5.5 percentof the civilian labor supply.   In theory, the labor supply at that level of unemployment ishardly of the same quality as it would be with, for instance, a 7percent jobless rate. At the higher rate, many experienced workersgenerally are seeking jobs.   Generally, as labor quality deteriorates _ as industry relies onless skilled, less productive workers _ business costs rise. Thistime they didn't, and the reasons why aren't totally clear.   Did business simply swallow the higher costs? Why didn'torganized labor put on a long-delayed push for higher wages? Couldit be that the memories of the 1970s were too painful to riskrepeating?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday, June 5</NOTE></DOC>
