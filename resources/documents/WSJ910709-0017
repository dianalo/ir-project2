Price is being criticized for privately informing BCCI'smanagement of big gaps in the bank's lending and controlswhile publicly giving the bank's financial report arelatively clean bill of health.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It sounds like Price was serving two masters, which is abig contradiction to what an auditor should be doing,&quot; saidLee Seidler, a former professor of accounting at New YorkUniversity's graduate school of business.   Mr. Seidler said auditing standards in England, whereBCCI's auditors are based, are less stringent than in theU.S., which could make it much more difficult forshareholders of BCCI to sue Price Waterhouse for allegednegligance based on Price's public audits.   &quot;The United Kingdom doesn't have a Securities and ExchangeCommission or securities laws similar to the U.S. so Pricewould have to be sued under common law, which is far moredifficult for the plaintiff bar, &quot;Mr. Seidler said. &quot;But itsounds to me like there are ethical issues involved thatPrice may have difficulty explaining.&quot;   Shaun O'Malley, chairman of Price in the U.S., said Pricehas been doing private investigative work for bank regulatorsoverseas and the Bank of England for some time to unearth theproblems that led to the closing of BCCI. &quot;Ourspecial-purpose reports to management last year and recentlyhelped lead to the liquidation,&quot; he adds.   Price has been explaining that a footnote to BCCI's 1989annual report saying that the government of Abu Dhabi wasguaranteeing BCCI's capital enabled the accounting firm togive the 1989 report a clean opinion.   Mr. Seidler said that under U.S. auditing standards Price,after reporting to BCCI's management privately about BCCI'smassive problems, would have had to resign the audit if thebank's management didn't go public with Price's privatereport. &quot;In the U.S., an auditor couldn't serve two masters,&quot;he added.   Gary Previts, an accounting professor at Case WesternReserve University's Weatherhead School of Management inCleveland, said that &quot;on the face of it, Price appears to bein a very sensitive position.&quot; Mr. Previts said that BCCI'sliquidation &quot;could put Price in a `no-win' situation becauseof the permanent expectation gap that will arise&quot; fromPrice's clean opinions of BCCI's financial reports for 1987and 1989. Price's opinion for BCCI's 1988 financial report isqualified but only relating to legal problems in Tampa, Fla.   Price has continually maintained that it followedprofessional standards in issuing auditor's opinions onBCCI's annual reports. And the accounting firm has indicatedthat bank regulators in England and elsewhere had given Pricethe job of sole auditor of BCCI in 1987 with the expectationthat Price would keep the regulators informed of BCCI'sfinancial problems, lack of internal controls and possiblefraud.</TEXT></DOC>
