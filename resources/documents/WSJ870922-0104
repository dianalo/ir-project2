The multibillion dollar research and development project, popularly known as Star Wars, has come under increased pressure from two directions: As the fastest growing item in the Pentagon's budget, it is a conspicuous target for budget cutters; meanwhile, the sense of urgency first associated with the program is diminishing -- especially in light of last week's progress in U.S.-Soviet arms-control talks.    With the Senate expected to take up the issue today, Sens. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) and Bennett Johnston (D., La.) plan to offer an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would provide $3.7 billion for the program in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. That is far below the $5.9 billion sought by the Reagan administration and the $4.6 billion approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee.    Whatever level of spending the Senate approves, the final Star Wars budget almost certainly will be lower after the Senate bill is reconciled with a House-passed measure that would provide only $3.1 billion for the program. This year, Star Wars spending totaled $3.6 billion. These figures include money for related construction jobs and nuclear experiments by the Department of Energy.    Pentagon officials say deep cuts in the administration's proposed budget would limit the program to laboratory research and prevent realistic testing of sensors and weapons.    Just last week, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger decided to advance six Strategic Defense Initiative projects from early research into a later, &quot;demonstration and validation&quot; stage. The Pentagon envisions conducting more live tests of sensors and interceptors in this phase, but officials say the work will remain stuck in the laboratory unless Congress provides the requested funds.    &quot;There's some tough sledding ahead,&quot; said one military officer working on the program. &quot;I don't think anybody who is close to the program is kidding themselves.&quot;    The Reagan administration hasn't fared well recently in its campaign to convince Congress to back its policies on strategic defense. Last week, the Senate adopted two amendments the administration strenuously opposed. One would require the Pentagon to obtain congressional approval before conducting any Star Wars experiments that would exceed what the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty traditionally has been interpreted to allow. The treaty, which the administration contends should be interpreted more expansively, curbs both superpowers' ability to test and develop anti-missile systems.    In a second vote that went against the administration, the Senate approved restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to award Star Wars contracts overseas. The administration has negotiated agreements with five U.S. allies paving the way for overseas research on space-based defenses. The agreements have provided the appearance of broad allied support for the program.    Opponents have seized on the recent momentum on arms control, especially the agreement in principle last week between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.    &quot;The best Star Wars could do by the year 2000 is neutralize half the Soviets' warheads,&quot; argued an aide to Sen. Proxmire. &quot;Why do we need to spend the money on Star Wars if arms control can do it for nothing?&quot;    Military officials concede that the superpowers' agreement to eliminate intermediate-range missiles calls into question work on one aspect of the strategic defense effort-systems to track and intercept tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.    Some supporters of the Star Wars program had hoped such systems could be one of the first strategic defense projects to be deployed. They acknowledge that the pending U.S.-Soviet accord will diminish some of the urgency for deployment. However, they point out that even with the missiles removed, new weapons still would be needed to protect Europe against Russian bombers and cruise missiles.    Meanwhile, supporters are scaling back their earlier hopes for the Star Wars program. Now &quot;it's an effort to keep the program breathing,&quot; said one House Republican aide. &quot;It's a time of limbo.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
