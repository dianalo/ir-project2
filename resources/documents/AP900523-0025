HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a unique assault on leukemia, doctors havefound that a form of vitamin A will turn cancer cells into normalones.   Medicine's usual way of combating cancer is to kill it. Doctorsadminister powerful toxic drugs in the hopes that they will destroymore cancerous cells than healthy ones.   The new approach instead tries to reform cancer cells. Itchanges the cells' genetic program, bypassing the genetic mix upthat makes them kill. In this way, the treatment induces the cancercells to live, to grow and eventually to die by the same rules thatgovern the rest of the body.   The drug, a synthetic form of vitamin A called all-transretinoic acid, was developed in China and tested in France. Thoughit has drawbacks and works in just one rare form of leukemia,doctors hope it will provide clues for short-circuiting the basicerrors that underlie all cancers.   ``The dogma has been to try to kill cancer cells,'' said Dr.Laurent Degos. ``Is it possible to change a cell, and not kill it,so it becomes normal?''   Degos, a researcher at Hopital Saint-Louis in Paris, presentedevidence that this indeed is possible in a report Tuesday at theannual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.   He tested the drug on victims of acute promyelocytic leukemia, arare blood cancer that strikes a few hundred people in the UnitedStates each year. All of them had failed earlier standard therapy.   He achieved complete, though often temporary, elimination of allsigns of the disease in 16 of 17 patients who had relapsed for thefirst time. There was complete remission in one of four patientswho had relapsed a second time.   ``There was no killing of cells, but they change,'' said Degos.``We see more mature cells.''   This form of leukemia is caused by a specific genetic defect,the mislocation of a piece of one string of genes, or chromosome,onto another chromosome. As a result, the cells get stuck in theirjuvenile stage. They fail to mature normally and eventually die.   Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid appears to bump the cellspast this roadblock in their development so they grow old.   ``This is a smashing development,'' commented Dr. CharlesSchiffer of the University of Maryland. ``It has impressed even themost cynical. This is a different approach to anything we have donein this disease in the past.''   Dr. Bruce Chesen of the National Cancer Institute said theinstitute plans soon to sponsor four small safety studies of thedrug. Once those are done, it will begin a larger review of itseffectiveness.   Though the synthetic vitamin wiped out obvious signs of theleukemia, the disease frequently came back, apparently because somecancer cells were resistant to the drug. Degas said it may benecessary to combine the treatment with standard chemotherapy totry to obliterate the few remaining cancer cells.   The drug was developed in China by Wang Zeng Yi, dean ofShanghai University II, a French-speaking medical school. It is nowbeing produced by Hoffman LaRoche, the pharmaceutical firm.   In an earlier report, doctors said they found that the acnemedicine Accutane, another synthetic form of vitamin A, preventsnew tumors from developing in people treated for smoking-relatedthroat cancer.   Among other research presented at the meeting:   _Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Instituteoutlined the first results of his pioneering attempt to insertforeign genes into cancer patients. The initial effort, carried outon seven melanoma patients, was intended to show that gene therapyis possible.   Doctors removed cancer-fighting blood cells from the patients'tumors, inserted a bacteria gene into them and then put them backinto the patients' bodies. The manipulated cells zeroed in on theirtumors. The doctors hope soon to repeat the experiment, this timeinserting a gene that produces a cancer-killing chemical calledtumer necrosis factor.   _A survey of American and Caribbean blacks in central Brooklynshowed that a surprising 4 percent were infected withcancer-causing human T-cell leukemia virus Type 1, or HTLV-I. Dr.Harvey Dosik of Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn said theinfection rate is 200 times higher than that seen nationwide inblood donors.   _Dr. Lode J. Swinnen of Loyola University in Chicago said he hadfound evidence that OKT3, an antibody treatment widely given torecipients of organ transplants, significantly increases their riskof non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer. He reviewed 154 hearttransplant patients and found that 11 percent of those getting OKT3since 1986 had developed the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
