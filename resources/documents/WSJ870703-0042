The permit was issued on March 10 to allow the Treasury to hear claims that the ban would reduce employment at the Energy Department's Paducah, Ky., plant and at other facilities engaged in converting such raw material into nuclear fuel.    Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), who helped manage the South Africa sanctions legislation, took the side of the uranium processors. He claimed that Congress hadn't intended the law, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, to ban these products, which are merely processed in the U.S. and reexported to other countries.    But the Treasury ruled that purchase of the materials is a prohibited &quot;importation&quot; as defined by the act. A department spokesman said he didn't know how much of the uranium is imported from South Africa. </TEXT></DOC>
