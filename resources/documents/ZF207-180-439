 Users connect their PCs tothe spooler via an RJ-45 modular jack and cable, which accepts datatransmitted at 9,600 or 19,200 bits per second.andM;The 256K buffer holds the equivalent of roughly 150 pages of text, accordingto extended Systems.andP;

 PC-XT users can purchase a VRAM Card in 512K($695) or 1MB ($995) versions, which enables PORT Lite to run entirely invirtual memory.andM;The package provides protection against power failures--a temporary outage atthe server does not result in data loss or a need for the rest of thestations to reboot, according to Waterloo.andM;When you've outgrown PORT Lite, Waterloo will provide an upgrade to its PORTPC LAN for $2,000.andM;Pop-up Graphs,andM;Easy StatsandM;From New EnglandandM;SoftwareandM;Since today's business requires more quantitative analysis than ever, NewEngland Software has come to the aid of users with two software packages thathelp uncover the jealously guarded secrets of their data.andM;Graph-in-the-Box Analytic lets you construct 16 types of graphs based on x-yand double-y plotting.andP;

 It also includes a calculation utility for manipulatingdata.andM;For number crunching, GB-STAT provides over 300 statistical procedures.andP;  Inaddition to calculating basic statistics, the menu-driven program performsANOVA; multiple, linear, and polynomial regressions; reliability, factor, anddiscriminant analyses; and time series procedures.andM;The program can import data in .PRN, .DIF, or ASCII format and has thegraphing capabilities of both Graph-in-the-Box programs.andM;Three 16-Level Gray-Scale Scanners fromandM;The Complete PCandM;If you want to incorporate images with 16 levels of gray into your documents,but your bank account dictates otherwise, three scanners from The Complete PCmight economically fill your needs.andM;The $899 Complete Page Scanner scans sheet-fed images up to 8 inches wide and14 inches long at a user-selectable 200 or 300 dots per inch.andP;

 Theyalso come with SmartScan, software that allows viewing of an image as it isscanned and is capable of letting you scan and edit images larger thanavailable RAM.andM;The menu-driven package allows users to rotate images 90, 180, or 270degrees; scale images from 10 to 200 percent of original size; crop and eraseimages; pixel edit; perform page layout; and merge iamges.andP;  SmartScan willedit images in .PCX, .MSP, .CUT, ASCII, and Epson FX graphics formats andconvert them to TIFF and .IMG formats as well.andM;Wang FreestyleandM;Electronic DesktopandM;Accepts Voice,andM;Handwritten InputandM;Wang Laboratories sustains the dream of the paperless office with Freestyle,an icon-based simulated desktop that accepts voice and handwrittenannotations.andP;
