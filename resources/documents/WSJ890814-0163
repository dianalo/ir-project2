The tiny gold fund has mailed shareholders more than $18 million in three distribution checks stemming from a bizarre fraud caper. Nearly $1.5 million more will be on the way, says a recent shareholder letter.    The payouts are from a settlement of a class-action suit filed two years ago by holders in the $40 million asset fund. The suit alleged that Prospector ran afoul of federal and state securities laws by violating its investment restrictions.    But the fund, it seems, also was victimized. The culprits: Prospector's former portfolio manager, who a Canadian court found was bribed by two Canadian stock promoters to buy worthless stock on the Vancouver Stock Exchange that cost the fund about $16 million.    To get the money, the fund itself filed several civil lawsuits; tracking down assets involved detective work from the Bahamas to Britain. Criminal charges by Canadian authorities also ensued.    &quot;It has not been fun,&quot; says Clark Aylsworth, founder and former chairman of United Services Advisors Inc., the fund's adviser, in the shareholder letter.    The current lowdown: The fund's former manager, Carl Lazzell, is out of prison after serving a short sentence in Canada.    &quot;As far as I know, {he} is residing in his home free as the breeze not too far from our offices&quot; in San Antonio, Texas, says Mr. Aylsworth in the letter. Mr. Lazzell, who was fired by the fund in 1985, couldn't be reached for comment.    One of the stock promoters, David Ward, is out on parole after a short jail term. The other promoter, Edward Carter, filed for bankruptcy-law protection from creditors and is facing a separate criminal trial on the charges this fall. Neither man could be reached for comment.    The approximately $18 million received by fund shareholders represents losses and interest, the fund says. An additional $1.5 million in interest will be mailed in increments within three years.    Meanwhile, the fund -- which has been closed to new investors since late 1985 -- is considering reopening soon, United Services officials said. The fund group manages 11 portfolios with a total of about $600 million in assets.    And what does the fund want investors to do with their checks?    &quot;We hope that most of you will reinvest your recovered assets in one or more of the United Services funds,&quot; says the shareholder letter. &quot;We have enclosed a postage-paid envelope for your convenience.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
