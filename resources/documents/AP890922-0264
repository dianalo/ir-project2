In July, the Fed, over the objection of Wall Street investmenthouses, granted banks the power to sell new corporate bond issues tothe public, overturning a restriction contained in theDepression-era Glass-Steagall Act.   That law was designed to segregate the businesses of banking andsecurities. It was prompted by the practice of banks in the 1920s ofselling corporate securities at inflated prices, with the proceedsused to repay bank loans.   Under the change approved by the Fed, banks must sell any bondissues through separately financed subsidiaries in order to ensurethat federally insured bank deposits are not involved in thefinancings. These subsidiaries may not borrow from their parentbanks.   In addition, the Fed imposed rules against the sharing ofinformation between the subsidiaries and the banks' loan officers.   Bankers Trust's proposed bond issue involves $150 million inhigh-yield, or junk, securities for Morningstar Foods Inc. ofDallas, a producer and distributor of dairy products.   The New York-based bank loaned $80 million to help a group ofTexas investors buy Morningstar from Southland Corp., operator ofthe 7-Eleven convenience stores, in 1988.   Some predict the entrance of banks into junk bond financing at atime when the junk-bond market is unsettled could produce a backlash.   ``If this does not scare the Federal Reserve, it will certainlyscare Congress,'' William J. Fitzpatrick, general counsel to theSecurities Industry Association, told The New York Times on today'seditions.   ``Having just rescued the savings and loan industry, I don'tthink Congress wants to see the banking industry involved in suchrisky businesses,'' he said.   The trade association has fought the entrance of banks into thesecurities field.</TEXT></DOC>
