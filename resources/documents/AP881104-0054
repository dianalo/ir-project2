The cities contend in the suit, filed Thursday, that the CensusBureau was prepared to make adjustments to compensate forundercounting, particularly of minority groups, but that it wasoverruled last year by the Commerce Department, its parent body.   Congressional seats and federal grants are allocated on the basisof population. If an area is undercounted, it may have fewerrepresentatives in the House and lose millions of dollars fromWashington.   The census as now structured misses many members of minoritygroups and illegal aliens, the suit contends, because many of themdo not respond to the mailed census forms.   The suit says they could be counted if census takers visitedhomes in selected areas and projected the results.   Also joining in the lawsuit were Chicago and Dade County, Fla.,which includes Miami; as well as the states of California and NewYork; the U.S. Conference of Mayors; the National League of Cities;the League of United Latin American Citizens; and the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People.   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn with theDepartment of Commerce, the Census Bureau and President Reagan amongthe defendants.   The Census Bureau has acknowledged it undercounts the population,although the best estimates suggest that only about 1 percent of thetotal was missed in the last 1980 census. But the bureau estimatesthe undercounting of blacks is 5 or 6 percentage points higher,since it is hard to reach the inner-city neighborhoods where manyshare addresses and distrust the government.   The Commerce Department referred all calls to the JusticeDepartment. Amy Brown, a spokeswoman, said the department had notyet received the complaint and therefore could not comment.   In Los Angeles, according to City Attorney James K. Hahn, thepopulation was undercounted by 4.6 percent in 1980. Blacks living inLos Angeles were undercounted by 9.1 percent, Hispanics by 9.8percent and Asians by 7.3 percent.   ``What makes this problem of undercounting particularlytroublesome _ and even tragic _ is that the people most affected arethe ones in the most dire need of adequate representation andhelp,'' Hahn said.   Zimroth, New York's corporation counsel, said the city wasundercounted by about 500,000 people in 1980 and that he expects the1990 census to be even less accurate.   New York state lost five of its 39 representatives as a result ofthe 1980 census and is expected to lose three more because of the1990 count, according to Election Data Services Inc.   In Chicago, officials said the undercount costs the city morethan $10 million a year in federal aid for social programs, a seatin the state House of Representatives, half a seat in the stateSenate, and one-fourth of a congressional seat.   New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams said an inaccuratecensus violates the principle of one man, one vote.   It would mean that ``states, cities and, in particular, minoritycommunities will be shortchanged on funds for housing, education,health, nutrition, community development, drug enforcement and othervital services,'' he said.   Zimroth said the city based much of its case on an affidavit byBarbara Bailar, the Census Bureau's associate director forstatistical standards, who resigned after 29 years to protest theDepartment of Commerce's decision not to go ahead with plans for anundercount correction.   Ms. Bailar was the federal government's chief witness against thecity in an unsuccessful similar suit New York brought to correct the1980 census. She said then that the technology to make an accuratecount was not available, but later concluded it could be done.   No date has been set for a hearing in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
