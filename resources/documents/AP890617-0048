The seven men and one woman were the first people condemned todie in Beijing for resisting the military in its drive on June 3-4to sweep pro-democracy students from Tiananmen Square.   Earlier this week, three Shanghai men also received the deathsentence for leading anti-government riots in that city.   Also today, more than 100 Chinese accused of joining the protestssurrendered, four Western journalists who were expelled by thegovernment left China, and the government tried to attract foreigninvestors back to China.   Government-run television reported that the eight were sentencedto death by the Beijing Intermediate Court for setting fire topublic buses and army trucks and beating several soldiers.   Estimates differ on how many died in the Beijing crackdown. Thegovernment variously says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, werekilled. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports saytroops fired on unarmed crowds and killed up to 3,000.   Beijing radio said 109 people in the capital had turnedthemselves in since the government started rounding up pro-democracyleaders. The radio also said 16 people gave themselves up inNanjing, one of the many Chinese cities where protests broke outafter the military sweep in Beijing.   Authorities have arrested more than 1,200 people nationwide thelast two weeks, including several student leaders.   Two American journalists left China today under governmentexpulsion orders for their reporting on the protests.   John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S.government-funded Voice of America were followed by plainclothespolice with video cameras as they said goodbye to colleagues at theBeijing airport before boarding a plane for Hong Kong.   The two, accused of violating martial law regulations barringreporters from talking to student leaders, were the firstBeijing-based foreign correspondents expelled during the currentpolitical upheaval.   Two reporters for the London-based Independent Television Newsalso left China today for Hong Kong after being ordered out forreporting on unrest in the southwestern city of Chengdu withoutproper press accreditation. They were in China on tourist visas.   The government, meanwhile, intensified its campaign to wooforeign investment back to China.   China's top trade official criticized foreign countries forhalting loans and aid to protest the government's suppression ofdissent and told foreign governments to ``return to the road ofcooperation with China.''   Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign economic relations and trade,said some nations were taking economic measures against China to``put pressure on China and interfere with Chinese internalaffairs,'' Beijing radio reported today.   He did not single out any countries for criticism. Earlier,however, China rebuked the United States for banning military salesand contracts in the wake of the military assault in Beijing.   Some other countries have taken similar action. France has frozenrelations with China, and Japan has put off new developmentassistance loans.   Thousands of foreign businessmen have fled China. Some are nowtrickling back, although the U.S. and Japanese governments stilladvise their citizens to keep away from China because of the turmoil.   In an interview broadcast today on Chinese television, governmentspokesman Yuan Mu invited foreign businessmen to return, saying: ``Iam sure those people who left hastily will regret it one day, but itis not too late to come back.'' Since China opened to the outsideworld a decade ago, businesses from Japan, Hong Kong, the UnitedStates and other countries have invested about $12 billion inChinese industries and set up nearly 10,000 joint ventures.   In a sign the government will soon announce a new crop ofhard-line rulers, Yuan said ``certain individuals'' in China'sleadership were ``guilty of supporting counterrevolutionaryturmoil.''   ``But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be madepublic,'' he said in the NBC-TV interview broadcast today on Chinesetelevision.   The Communist Party's Central Committee is expected to meet soonto oust party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a leading moderate. Heis believed to have been stripped of power after opposing thedecision by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng todeclare martial law in Beijing on May 20.</TEXT></DOC>
