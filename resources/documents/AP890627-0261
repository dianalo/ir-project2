The requests for a stay had been filed in June by the Puerto RicoTelephone Co. and La Telefonica Larga Distancia, which had said thenew plan to place a ``cap'' on the prices American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. can charge would put the two companies at acompetitive disadvantage. They also said the plan would harm thepublic interest.   But the FCC, in a decision reached Friday and made publicTuesday, said the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for astay and that the public would benefit from the new pricing.   The so-called ``price cap'' plan, which the FCC adopted in Marchafter a two-year study, replaces a 20-year-old ``rate of return''regulatory scheme that had placed limits on what ATandamp;T could earnabove its costs. Most recently that limit was 12.2 percent.   FCC spokeswoman Patricia Chew said the commission also wasreviewing other petitions to suspend the price cap plan, so it wasnot immediately known if the plan would go into effect July 1.   ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company was confident itwould prevail.   ``We expect price caps will go into effect July 1,'' Linnen said.   ATandamp;T last month told the commission it would lower its prices by$140 million on July 1, through reductions is basic long-distancerates and its special Reach Out America calling plan.   In its decision, the FCC said ``Price cap regulation offerssignificant consumer benefits that do not exist under rate of returnregulation. ... In light of the proposed decreases, we believe thatthe public interest weighs strongly in favor of proceeding with theimplementation of our price cap rules.''   The price cap plan allows ATandamp;T, which in 1988 controlled 68percent of the U.S. long-distance market, to raise rates 3percentage points less than the rate of inflation in threecategories of service: residential and small business; 800 calls;and other business services, mainly for large customers.   The FCC has said the plan is intended to give ATandamp;T an incentiveto cut costs and that consumers could save $900 million in chargesover four years.   Under rate-of-return regulation, ATandamp;T's long-distance rates havedropped 38 percent since 1984. Much of that decrease, however, hasresulted from higher prices consumers have been paying to connect tolocal telephone networks.   With consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paidless to the local telephone networks, and the FCC has forced ATandamp;T topass those savings along to its long-distance customers.   Puerto Rican Telephone argued that ATandamp;T will be able to apply the``flow through'' savings to individual services in a way that woulddisadvantage competitors. The company also argued that the FCCshould consider price cap regulations for the local Bell operatingcompanies at the same time it does for ATandamp;T.   The FCC has proposed to impose price caps on the seven Bellcompanies beginning in July 1990.   La Telefonica Larga Distancia, a Puerto Rican long-distancecompany, argued it would be harmed by the access charge provisionsand that the FCC should have imposed tighter limits on ATandamp;T pricechanges.</TEXT></DOC>
