But that oh-so-'80stradition is fading as advertisers hunker down in astill-bleak economy.   For this year, anyway, spirits companies are rediscoveringthe value of old-fashioned print ads, leaving theirinteractive &quot;spectaculars&quot; on ice.</LP><TEXT>   Booze marketers have had a disastrous year, with salesexpected to slide a startling 6.5% compared with annualdeclines of only 2.8% in the late 1980s, according to M.Shanken Communications's Impact Databank. After bravelyraising their ad budgets 7.2% last year, nearly every majorplayer is cutting back. Most distillers question the wisdomof spending a fortune on the clutter of elaborate holiday adsin what one executive calls &quot;the arms race of advertising.&quot;Some see splashy, gimmicky ads as out of step with these hardtimes.   &quot;It's going to be a different kind of Christmas thisyear,&quot; says Janice Grossman, publisher of New York magazine,a favored venue for spectaculars since Absolut's microchip adfirst squeaked out &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; a few years ago.&quot;Somehow, with this economy, they're not appropriate now.&quot;   But taking a lower profile also courts risk. In the 33days from Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve, spirits companiesspend as much as 40% of their annual ad budgets to generateas much as 30% of their annual sales. Many potentialcustomers are giftbuyers who aren't all that familiar withliquor brands. If distillers cut back, they miss a primeopportunity to win new fans.   Most spirits marketers, however, are deciding less ismore. For the first time in years, Jos. E. Seagram andamp; Sonswill use print ads on ordinary stock, instead of heavy-papercut-outs, for its premium Chivas Regal and Crown Royalbrands. Schieffelin andamp; Somerset is rerunning thestraightforward print campaigns it introduced last year forTanqueray and Johnnie Walker Black, distancing itself evenfurther from the evergreen-scented, three-dimensional andsticker-sheet ads of years past.   Cutty Sark will take a tongue-in-cheek view of the usualfold-out, pop-up ads of distillers. The Hiram Walker-ownedbrand of scotch will use a pop-up box with a closed stagecurtain on it and the headline, &quot;A lot of people judge an adby how elaborate the gimmick is this time of year.&quot; Apull-tab opens the curtain and reveals the punchline: &quot;A lotof people are wrong. Merry Christmas from Cutty Sark.&quot;   Cutty Sark is running as No. 4 in the premium scotchsegment, which has been particularly hard-hit. Ron Robillard,Hiram Walker's vice president and director of marketing,says, &quot;We just thought we needed something that says `We'rehere] We're alive and well]'&quot;   Only Absolut vodka, the brand that pioneered the rushtoward holiday &quot;spectaculars,&quot; is bucking the trend in a bigway. &quot;My philosophy is in good times and bad times, you haveto keep fueling your product,&quot; says Michel Roux, chiefexecutive of Carillon Importers, which markets Absolut.   Its past efforts have employed microchips that playedChristmas carols and offered holiday greetings in eightlanguages, as well as a suspension of plastic &quot;snow&quot; fallingon a vodka bottle. This year, Absolut will wrap a silkhandkerchief in cardboard as a &quot;gift.&quot; Carillon, a Teaneck,N.J., unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, increased Absolut's1990 ad budget of $25 million by 10% this year.   Competitors who have opted out of the spectacular game,says senior vice president Richard Lewis of TBWA Advertising,which created the Absolut spot, &quot;got their feet wet and foundout the water was too cold -- or at least their feet were.&quot;But rivals counter they aren't in retreat; they just aren'tin any mood for a fleeting, expensive holiday message.   &quot;This year we want more exposure,&quot; says Leo Greenland,chairman of Smith/Greenland Advertising, of his agency'sconservative plans for Tanqueray and Johnnie Walker. &quot;Thiswill be our straight, great advertising.&quot;   Tom McInerny, executive vice president for marketing atthe House of Seagram, notes &quot;a certain amount offollow-the-leader mentality&quot; on the part of distillersplacing gimmicky ads in past holiday seasons. &quot;We won't do itjust for the sake of doing it.&quot;   For similar reasons, Hennessy cognac is using a moresubtle pitch. Schieffelin andamp; Somerset vice president Ben Stonecalls it an &quot;anti-spectacular.&quot; For this year's holidaycampaign, Schieffelin, a joint venture of LVMH Moet HennessyLouis Vuitton and Guinness PLC, is inserting into magazines asimple, unbranded greeting card. It invites readers tocontact an old friend for the holidays to capture &quot;thefeeling of Hennessy.&quot; The card-ad cost nearly nothing toproduce, but Jonathan Bond, president of Kirshenbaum andamp; Bond,Hennessy's ad agency, expects to spend nearly $1 million toplace three million of them in issues of national magazines.   &quot;If this works, we're going to do it every year and becomeknown for the card,&quot; says Mr. Bond.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          RED MAN: The Federal Trade Commission and PinkertonTobacco settled FTC charges over Pinkerton's Red Man Seriesof televised truck- and tractor-pulling events. The FTC saidthe event, produced and sponsored by the tobacco company,violated a 1986 ban on advertising smokeless tobacco ontelevision, the first enforcement action involving thatstatute. Signs for Red Man adorned vehicles, billboards,flags and uniforms at the event, which were nearly always oncamera, a commission spokesman said. Under the settlement,the FTC limited mentions of the series name duringbroadcasts.                                                                                                          PLAX: Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co.'s world-wide advertising unitis expected to lose European billings for the overseasadvertising of Plax, the anti-plaque mouthwash. Pfizer soldthe brand's overseas business to Colgate-Palmolive yesterday,creating a major conflict at the agency between Saatchiclient Procter andamp; Gamble and arch-rival Colgate. &quot;We knowthere is a potential conflict,&quot; said an agency spokeswoman,&quot;but we don't know how it will be resolved.&quot;   KETCHUM: Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Seiden, 63 years old, chairman ofthe New York office of Pittsburgh-based KetchumCommunications, has resigned to start his own business. Hisdeparture leaves Thom Miller, president of the New Yorkoffice, in charge of its estimated $130 million in billings.Mr. Seiden had been president of Hicks andamp; Greist, the New Yorkagency that Ketchum acquired in 1987.
