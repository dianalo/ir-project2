Tunable lasers based on crystals dopedby the transition metal ion chromium and on organic dyes disolved inliquid solvents are reviewed. The sol-gel technique for preparing oxideglasses is outlined, and the incorporation of organic laser dyes in theglass during gelation is described. Absorption, emission, and quantumyields of laser dyes in various environments are listed. The spectralcharacteristics of the laser dye in the glass depend on the acidity ofthe glass. Means to enhance molecular fluorescence in glass are considered.</TEXT></DOC>
