Schellhardt and Amal Kumar NajStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WX PRABINDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, MACHINE TOOLS (IND) </IN><TEXT>   Westinghouse Electric Corp., exiting from the hydraulic robot manufacturing business, granted Prab Robots Inc. of Kalamazoo, Mich., exclusive rights to make and service Unimate industrial robots.    As a result, Westinghouse plans to close its Danbury, Conn., robot manufacturing plant at the end of the month.    Westinghouse intends to focus its factory automation operations on electric-drive robots, and is discussing a joint venture with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan in the factory automation field, a spokesman said.    The Pittsburgh-based electronic product maker, defense contractor and broadcaster currently makes control systems for its electric robots in the U.S., and manufactures the robot arm assemblies in Britain.    Westinghouse said it doesn't expect any financial impact from its decision involving its Unimate hydraulic robots, of which there are about 3,600 in operation.    Demand for hydraulic robots, used primarily for lifting heavy objects by the auto and other industries, has fallen dramatically in recent years. Electronic robots, on the other hand, are increasingly popular because they're faster, less noisy, easier to install and better suited for automated factory assembly duties.    Still, the decision involving the Unimate robots is significant since they have come to symbolize Westinghouse's travails in the robotics field.    Westinghouse in 1983 paid Condec Corp. $107 million for Unimation, then the nation's No. 1 robot maker with an estimated 35% of the market.    Unimation introduced the first industrial robot to the U.S. 25 years ago.    Westinghouse soon discovered, however, the Unimate robots were practically obsolete. Unimation's sales sagged, top officials left, and the operation began to post losses.    In the past few years, a major portion of Unimation's business has been in remaking of Unimates already installed, an attractive move to customers who wanted to avoid the costs of a new robot but sought the latest enhancements.    The acquisition of Unimation's industrial robot business would make Prab a major manufacturer in the heavy manufacturing segment of the industry. Walter Weisel, Prab's president, declined to disclose the value of the transaction, and would only say Unimation would add substantially to Prab's business.    &quot;We're assuming from Westinghouse better than 3,600 machines and more than 500 new customers,&quot; he said. &quot;For us to acquire the license to build Unimate robots is like Boeing Co. selling rights to 727 to Cessna. It's very attractive for us.&quot;    Westinghouse's move out of the hydraulic-robot field reflects a major and recent retrenchment in that segment.    In 1982, Prab's three largest customers were General Motors Corp., General Electric Corp. and Westinghouse. But GM itself soon got into the robot business through a joint venture with Japan's Fanuc Ltd., GE then started its own robot business, and in 1983, Westinghouse acquired Unimation. Since that time, however, those companies have all scaled down their involvement with robots.    &quot;We have come full circle,&quot; Mr. Weisel said.    Prab said it will relocate the Unimate manufacturing operation from Danbury to Kalamazoo by early August. Prab said it plans to relocate a number of former Unimation employees to Kalamazoo and retain the others in Danbury, where Prab will establish a branch office. </TEXT></DOC>
