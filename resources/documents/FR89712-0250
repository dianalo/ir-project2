Background </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-49, Item VI.</T3> Award of contracts for recurring and continuingservice requirements are often delayed due to circumstances beyond thecontrol of contracting offices. Examples of circumstances causing suchdelays are bid protests and alleged mistakes in bid. Pending resolutionof these circumstances, contracting officers are forced to negotiate shortextensions to existing contracts. Changes are being made to FAR 17.208,37.111, and 52.217-8 to permit contracting offices to include an optionprovision which will enable the Government to require continued performanceof any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.The option provision could be exercised more than once, but the total extensionof performance thereunder could not exceed 6 months. <T3>FAC 84-49, Items IX and X.</T3> The interim rule in FAC 84-6, ItemIII, implemented requirements of sections 2713 and 2741, Pub. L. 98-369,the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, regarding proceduresfor filing protests with the General Accounting Office and the GeneralServices Board of Contract Appeals. The interim rule also implemented JusticeDepartment advice that the GAO ``stay'' provisions in 31 U.S.C. 3553 (c)and (d) and the GAO ``damages'' provision in 31 U.S.C. 3554(c) regardingpayment of costs of filing and pursuing a protest and preparing the bidand proposal, are unconstitutional. The interim rule in FAC 84-9 revised FAC 84-6, Item III, coverage to implementrevised Justice Department advice regarding the ``stay'' and ``damages''provisions of CICA. The final rule also revises the clause at 52.212-13, Stop-Work Order, theclause at 52.212-14, Stop Work Order_Facilities, and the clause at 52.233-3,Protest After Award. The clause revisions are based on a public commentreceived recommending that language concerning equitable adjustments berevised to allow contractors 30 days to assert a right to an adjustmentafter the end of a period of work stoppage. The revised clause languageis consistent with revisions made in FAC 84-29, Item X, ``FAR Changes Clauses'',which was published as a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 12, 1987 (52 FR 30074). <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-49, Items I thru VII, XI and XII.</T3> DoD, GSA, and NASA certifythat the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) does not apply tothese final rules because each revision is not a ``significant revision''as defined in FAR 1.501-1; i.e., it does not alter the substantive meaningof any coverage in the FAR having a significant cost or administrativeimpact on contractors or offerors, or a significant effect beyond the internaloperating procedures of the issuing agencies. <T3>FAC 84-49, Item VIII.</T3> DoD, GSA, and NASA certify that this finalrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, etseq., because the translation inconsistency clause is routinely used inoverseas contracts when prospective vendors require a translation intoa local language. <T3>FAC 84-49, Items IX and X.</T3> A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysispertaining to CICA protest coverage has been prepared in accordance withthe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.
