Conventional chemotherapy seems to have arrested hercancer, says the mother of two in Hanover, Pa. But before thetreatments, the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes in herneck, a sign that it will probably recur in a deadlier,metastatic form within a few years.</LP><TEXT>   Mrs. Lupro, 38 years old, believes a new treatment,involving an &quot;autologous bone marrow transplant,&quot; or ABMT,could kill lingering tumor cells and buy her a lot of time.But her health insurer, Travelers Corp., says the procedureis still experimental, hence not covered. Without aninsurer's promise to pay, hospitals won't begin the costlytreatment, which employs a dangerous, high-dose blast ofconventional anti-cancer drugs.   &quot;I'm not as mad as my husband,&quot; says Mrs. Lupro, who saysshe may sue Travelers to get an ABMT. &quot;It's harder on him.&quot; ATravelers spokeswoman says the Lupro case is &quot;being reviewedwith an outside oncologist.&quot;   The Lupros are caught up in one of the nation's fiercesthealth-care debates. Preliminary studies on ABMT for breastcancer indicate it may work better than conventionalalternatives for some women. A recent report in Tokyo showedthat about one-third of 258 metastatic breast-cancer patientstreated with ABMT after standard chemotherapy showed no signsof the disease in follow-up periods of 12 to 42 months,according to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which sponsored themeeting.   Karen Antman, a researcher at the Dana-Farber CancerInstitute in Boston, told the meeting that the frequency oftumor disappearance in certain patients is &quot;much higher&quot; thanwith standard chemotherapy.   But the treatment, which typically costs $100,000 or more,is risky. About 9% of patients with various stages of breastcancer have died from complications after the therapy,according to Dr. Antman. Most doctors say that more data onABMT is needed to establish whether it's better thanalternative treatments.   &quot;I think the insurance companies are right. ABMT is veryexperimental for breast cancer,&quot; says Subhash Gulati, chiefof the ABMT team at New York's Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center. Still, he adds, early results with it are&quot;encouraging,&quot; warranting further studies.   Some doctors are less optimistic. Based on available data,&quot;I certainly can't conclude that {breast-cancer} patients arebetter off with ABMT,&quot; says David Eddy, a Duke Universityhealth-policy professor and a consultant to the Blue Cross andamp;Blue Shield Association.   The stakes in the ABMT debate are large. The rate ofbreast-cancer incidence in the U.S. has risen sharply in thepast decade, though the mortality rate has held steady. Thisyear, about 150,000 women will be diagnosed with the disease.The metastatic form will develop in about 30% of those women,with most patients dying within two years.   Doctors testing ABMT for breast cancer estimate thatone-fourth to one-half of metastatic cases may be goodcandidates for the procedure -- if it's proved effective.Physicians also are testing ABMT to treat high-risk patientsbefore metastasis, as well as people with testicular cancerand melanoma. For certain other cancers, such as leukemia,ABMT already is an accepted treatment covered by insurers.   &quot;It's too early to say this approach is right for publicconsumption,&quot; says Jacob Bitran, a University of Chicagocancer researcher testing ABMT. &quot;But I've never seenmetastatic breast cancer patients respond as frequently&quot; asthey do with ABMT, he says.   Its promise appears greatest with breast-cancer patientswhose cancers respond to conventional chemotherapy, saysNancy Davidson, a Johns Hopkins University researcher. Ahigher dose of the same drugs is likely to wipe out even morebreast cancer cells in those patients, she says, raising thechances of long-term remission. But at high doses, the drugscripple the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable tofatal infections.   To prevent that, doctors using ABMT extract marrow cellsfrom patients' pelvic bones through needles before givingthem anti-cancer drugs. The extracts contain immune-cellprecursors that, when reinfused after chemotherapy, &quot;rescue&quot;patients' immune systems. Unlike conventional chemotherapy,which requires shots over months or years, anti-cancer drugswith ABMT are administered in intense doses over severaldays.   The procedure typically requires three or more weeks ofhospitalization for immune-system recovery. That's what makesit so expensive. But the advent of &quot;colony stimulatingfactors&quot; -- experimental drugs to speed immune-cell growth --and other recent advances &quot;are knocking four or five daysoff&quot; that period, says Chicago's Dr. Bitran. He estimatesthat the procedure's costs now are &quot;pretty close&quot; to those ofa typical course of conventional chemotherapy for metastaticbreast cancer.   The improvements also are narrowing patients' windows ofvulnerability to fatal infections, such as pneumonia. Deathsfrom the treatment now occur in about 4% to 9% of patientswho are treated by doctors experienced with it, compared with20% in one early study, says Andrew Dorr, a National CancerInstitute researcher.   Dr. Dorr adds that the NCI plans this fall to organize alarge clinical study of the new therapy and breast cancer.But the study, which doctors agree is sorely needed, mayspark controversies of its own. One issue is whether insurersshould help pay for it.   In any case, many women feel they don't have time to waitfor definitive studies. One is Pam Pirozzi, a 35-year-oldmother in Tracy's Landing, Md., diagnosed with breast cancerlast year. She sued her insurer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield ofVirginia, to force it to pay for an ABMT. Last month, afederal judge in Alexandria, Va., ruled in her favor,potentially setting an important precedent.   But during her legal battle, says Mrs. Pirozzi, her cancerspread to her cranium. Now she's undergoing conventionaltherapy, hoping to follow it up with ABMT this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
