BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has ruled that a lesbian couple'sdispute over custody of a child they raised together can proceed totrial, in a case that tests a mostly uncharted area of family law, alawyer said.   ``At the heart of it are fundamental concepts of family, equalityand the right of persons who are lesbian to have access to theirchildren,'' attorney Gloria Allred said Wednesday.   The lawsuit arises at a time when lesbian partners increasinglyare arranging to have children, either by adoption or artificialinsemination.   Allred's client, Terri Sabol, 32, of Long Beach, is seeking legaljoint custody of a 2-year-old girl who was born to Sabol'sthen-partner.   The couple conceived the child through artificial insemination,using sperm donated by a relative of Ms. Sabol's, Ms. Allred said ina telephone interview.   When the couple broke up, the 29-year-old mother, who was notidentified, allegedly began to restrict Ms. Sabol's time with thegirl and refused to permit Ms. Sabol to participate in parentaldecisions.   Ms. Sabol sued on Nov. 29 to establish her rights as a parent.   ``We asked the court to recognize that this was a family,although not a traditional one, and that it would be unfair todeprive our client of contact with the child,'' Ms. Allred said.   The mother's attorney, Mitchell Jacobs, responded by seeking todismiss the case in a legal motion known as a demurrer, which arguesthat the court has no legal authority to consider the claim.   But on Monday, Superior Judge Richard E. Denner overruled thedefendant's motion, allowing the case to proceed to determine if Ms.Sabol has a legal right to joint legal and physical custody. Notrial date has been scheduled.   ``My client has no comment on the case,'' Jacobs said after thedecision.   Ms. Sabol expressed relief at the ruling and said she had not hadcontact with the child for three months.   ``There are literally thousands of people now in my situation ...but there are no laws protecting us,'' she said in a telephoneinterview.   The court has sealed records in the case, according to a bailifffor Denner.   Roberta Achtenberg, directing attorney of the Lesbian RightsProject in San Francisco, said she was aware of a half-dozen similarcases in California in recent years, as well as a few in New York.However, there is ``no controlling legal precedent'' because no casehas ever reached appellate level, she said.   To gain a court hearing, a parental custody claim typically mustcite a recognized legal relationship to the child, usually by adissolution of marriage or paternity claim, Ms. Achtenberg said. Butneither claim is available to a lesbian parent.   Without specific guidance from the legislature, said Ms.Achtenberg, ``The courts have gotten stuck over their authority tohear a claim by a person who is not related to the mother, and whois not related to the child.''</TEXT></DOC>
