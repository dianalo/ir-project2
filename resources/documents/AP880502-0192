Price.   The storm also contributed to weekend wind in SouthernCalifornia that left one boater dead and another missing andbelieved drowned.   The weather system rolled onto the Plains on Monday, spreadinglocally heavy rain and thunderstorms ahead of itself, and it alsokicked out a funnel cloud over southeastern Colorado thatdissipated without causing damage.   Interstate 80 in Wyoming was closed Monday morning from Laramiewest to Walcott Junction, then was reopened about five hours later.But police later closed U.S. 287 south out of Laramie because ofpoor conditions and a series of minor accidents that clogged thehighway.   Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzard conditions aroundCheyenne, parts of which had no power during the morning. The windcombined with temperatures in the 20s across most of Wyoming todrive the wind chill factor to 2 degrees below zero, the weatherservice said.   Schools in Cheyenne were closed and workers in federal officesthere were told to follow their department's bad weather plan.State government workers living in rural areas were told their paywould not be docked if they chose not to drive into Cheyenne, saidDennis Curran, spokesman for Gov. Mike Sullivan.   The Colorado State Patrol closed a 70-mile section of Interstate70 from just east of Aurora to Limon in both directions Mondaymorning because of numerous accidents, heavy snow and poorvisibility.   That section of I-70 was closed for more than two hours Sundaybecause of zero visibility when 50 mph wind caused a dust storm.Two major pileups on the highway killed two people and injured 17,officials said.   A 17-mile stretch of I-70 from Goodland, Kan., to Colorado alsowas closed Monday afternoon at the request of the Kansas StatePatrol, which said stranded motorists had filled every hotel alongthat portion of the highway.   The storm also caused some school closures Monday in easternColorado. At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, flights weredelayed up to 1{ hours because of poor visibility, said airportspokesman Richard Boulware. He said only 33 planes were able toland every hour, down from the usual 75.   Strong northerly wind blew across eastern Colorado with gustsMonday of up to 83 mph at La Junta and 64 mph at Colorado Springs.   The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains andfoothills of south-central Montana, with up to a foot of snow inthe mountains of northern Colorado. Snow also fell in western SouthDakota, with 4 inches on the ground in the Black Hills.   Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern Wyoming, closingYellowstone's eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of thepark, 5 inches of snow was reported in Moose and Jackson, wheredowned power lines caused blackouts.   Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24hours at Alliance, Neb., and 1.86 inches at Rapid City, S.D., theweather service reported. Half-inch hail stones fell at Sidney andAlliance, Neb.   Rain also fell over most of western Kansas and wind gusted above30 mph at Dodge City and Russell.   High wind blew across the northern Plains, with gusts exceeding50 mph reported throughout the Dakotas.   The wind whipped loose topsoil into a dust storm aroundAberdeen, S.D., forcing some drivers to turn on their headlights inthe middle of the day Sunday. Farmer Harry Pharis Jr. of ruralGroton said about 30 acres of newly sprouted barley was cut down bythe wind and blowing grit.   Winds gusting to nearly 40 mph in Tulsa about noon Monday toredown at least five power lines and interrupted electrical serviceto about 1,700 customers, said Public Service Co. of Oklahomaspokeswoman Nancy Harlow.   The difference in pressure between the storm and a high-pressurefront off the West Coast generated 65 mph wind Saturday in southernCalifornia, whipping up waves that destroyed a municipal pier inRedondo Beach and stranded 1,400 tourists overnight on SantaCatalina Island.   The body of a man believed to have jumped from a disabled boatwashed ashore Sunday, said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Sgt. TomHargett. Another man knocked off a boat Saturday near Catalina wasmissing and believed drowned, said Coast Guard Petty OfficerCharles Embleton.</TEXT></DOC>
