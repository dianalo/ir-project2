(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two months of hot, dry weather havedevastated Georgia's peanut crop and could force consumers to payhigher prices for peanut butter.   Don Koehler, executive director of the Georgia PeanutCommission, said the 1990 crop will be the worst in a decade. Hepredicted peanut growers will suffer $150 million in crop losses.He estimated the loss to the state's economy at up to $600 million.   Georgia is the nation's top peanut-producing state, accountingfor nearly half of U.S. production. Peanuts are also Georgia's topcash crop.   Georgia growers are expected to harvest 703,000 tons this year,down 24 percent from last year.   The Alabama and Florida crops, which represent 18 percent ofU.S. production, are down 21 percent. But some of the shortfallwill be made up by producers in Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahomaand Texas, where growing conditions were better.   The U.S. peanut harvest is expected to total 1.7 million tons,down 11 percent from last year, but sufficient for domestic needs.   Koehler said Tuesday offers to farmers have already increased 20percent to $760 per ton and may increase further, depending onweather and crop conditions.   Mitch Head, executive director of the Peanut Advisory Board, anAtlanta-based trade association representing Southeasternproducers, said retail peanut butter prices could increase from 5percent to 10 percent.   Head said the drought will leave fewer peanuts for export, butshould not create a shortage for U.S. consumers. Americans consumed1.55 millions tons of peanut products last year.   Emory Murphy, assistant executive director of the PeanutCommission, said consumers should not see the higher peanut butterprices until January, when manufacturers began turning the 1990crop into peanut butter and other products.   ``The increase will push a peanut butter sandwich cost up 1 centto 16.5 cents - still a nutritional bargain and one of the cheapestprotein sources in the American diet,'' Murphy said.</TEXT></DOC>
