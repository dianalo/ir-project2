However, there areservice life and fouling problems. A gas-to-gas heat exchanger (recuperator)has been developed whose service life should exceed the amortizationperiod. This recuperator was tested to demonstrate its performance anddetermine its fouling characteristics and service life in harsh industrialenvironments. The test furnace was an open hearth reverberatory aluminumremelt furnace, at Roth Brothers Smelting Corp. in East Syracuse, NY.The recuperators' performance was monitored over six months. The furnacewas operated at several firing rates and flue gas temperatures to bracketrecuperator performance. Production and fuel use data were collected.The system was instrumented for flow, pressure, and temperature measurement.Finally, coupon samples of liner material were suspended in flue gasnear the recuperators' exhaust for data on corrosion rates. The recuperatorsperformed well. Combustion air preheat temperatures of 850{sup 0}F wererecorded for the design point firing rate, with a flue gas temperatureof 1900{sup 0}F. The service life was estimated to be 2.9 years. Fuelsavings under normal operation varied from 13 to 40%, depending on thespecific firing schedule. The recuperators required no regular maintenanceafter initial adjustments. Visual examination of the liners after fivemonths of operation revealed no areas of excessive corrosion. Calculatedfuel savings based on the baseline furnace performance were $84,900 forthe first six months, which would easily pay for the recuperator andinstallation costs in under 1.5 years. Both recuperators were still inservice in midyear 1987 after nearly two years of operation. Repair ofthe end seal was required because of excessive leakage.</TEXT></DOC>
