Mauricio Diaz, president of the People's Social Christian Party,said he was leaving the National Opposition Union (UNO) becauseleftist parties in the coalition had too much power.   However, an official of UNO told The Associated Press thathigh-ranking members of Diaz's party had denied there was a splitin ranks.   ``UNO's political council is in session right now ... and theexecutive commission of the People's Social Christian Party is inthe meeting,'' UNO spokesman Luis Sanchez said Thursday eveningafter Diaz announced his decision at a news conference.   ``They insist that the party as such will maintain itself withinUNO and that if Diaz is breaking away, he's doing so on his own,''Sanchez added.   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the oppositionnewspaper La Prensa, and Virgilio Godoy are the UNO presidentialand vice presidential candidates for the Feb. 25 elections.   Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy are running against President DanielOrtega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez of the leftist SandinistaNational Liberation Front, which has been in power for a decade.   Diaz told reporters his party would support Erick Ramirez, thepresidential candidate of the splinter Social Christian Party.Diaz's party has six deputies in the National Assembly, thethird-largest opposition party in the country's single chamberlegislature.   Apparently the split came when UNO was discussing how toapportion candidacies among its 14 parties for the 90 seats in theNational Assembly.   According to the Nicaraguan Constitution, the Assembly has 90seats based on the last census estimate, but defeated presidentialcandidates are guaranteed one seat each. Apart from UNO and theSandinista Front, at least six parties are running presidentialcandidates.   The current National Assembly has 96 deputies, as six partiesapart from the Sandinista Front ran presidential candidates in the1984 elections.   The deadline for registering candidates at all levels is Friday.   Diaz said UNO offered his party two deputies' candidacies whilethe Communist and Socialist parties were offered six seats each. Hesaid this was incongruent, because his party was the fourth largestvote-getter in the 1984 elections, while the Communists were fifthand the Socialists sixth.   ``Leftist parties within UNO have too much influence and greatpower,'' Diaz said at the news conference, sitting next to Ramirez.   The choice of Godoy as the vice presidential candidate fourweeks ago created a crisis in UNO because some parties favored arightist businessman. The crisis was finally resolved and Godoy wasaccepted, but not before some parties had threatened to break away.   The leadership of Godoy's party, the Independent Liberal, alsohas been having internal power struggles.   UNO members _ 12 legally registered parties and two splintergroups _ bickered for weeks over the procedure for apportioning thedeputies' slots, and were still discussing the matter less than 24hours before the deadline for registering them.</TEXT></DOC>
