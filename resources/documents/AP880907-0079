The witness, Peter W. Hill, was one of 39 Americans held hostagefor 17 days aboard TWA Flight 847 in June 1985 after it was seizedon a flight from Athens to Rome and diverted to Beirut. U.S. Navydiver Robert Stethem was shot and killed during the ordeal.   Hill, 60, testified that after Stethem was killed, Hamadistarted talking to him. ``Hamadi, gloating, said, `This is the gunthat killed him (Stethem).' He seemed quite proud of it.''   Hill said that was the only time he saw Hamadi with the gun inhis hand.   Hamadi has admitted he was one of the hijackers but denieskilling Stethem, saying he tried to prevent the slaying.   Hill, who lived in Hoffman Estates, Ill., at the time of thehijacking, was the first American to testify at Hamadi's trial.Hill, who worked for a West German travel agency, was directing aHoly Land tour for Chicago-area residents.   He said passengers were forced to put their heads between theirknees for nearly six hours after the flight was hijacked, and thatsome were abused.   ``I was conscious that some passengers were being abusedphysically. I couldn't see it because my head was between my knees,but I heard the sound of slapping,'' Hill testified.   ``Later when two men were brought back to the economy class Ibecame aware that they had been subjected to a horrible beating,''Hill said, identifying them as passengers Curt Carlson and Stethem.``I could see that Mr. Stethem had been severely beaten.''   Later, Hill said, ``I heard a muffled sound from the forwarddepartment. I am somewhat of an expert on small arms and Idetermined that it was a gunshot. I feared the worst.''   Stethem's body was then thrown onto the Beirut airport runway.   Hill testified that Flight 847 pilot John Testrake, of Richmond,Mo., told him, ``A young man (Stethem) was brutally murdered.''   ``Every time I think of it, even after three years, I am veryaffected.'' Hill said, his voice shaking with emotion.   Stethem's father, Richard, took notes during Hill's testimony,and his mother, Patricia, listened with her head bowed.   Hill said shortly after the murder, 12 men dressed in soldiers'uniforms came aboard the plane. ``There was definite comraderybetween these men, which we later learned were from Amal, and thehijackers.''   He added that the hijackers robbed everyone on the plane, takingmoney and jewelry from the passengers. ``They became commonthieves, common pirates, and they were drooling over their gains.''   During testimony Tuesday, Hamadi repeated his claims ofinnocence involving Stethem's death, but he refused to identify theaccomplice who he says shot the sailor.   ``I already said the other (one of his accomplices) wasresponsible and he was the murderer,'' Hamadi said.   ``Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane,to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,''Hamadi said. He refused to say who issued the orders.   Transcripts of tapped telephone calls introduced in courtsuggested that Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, received help fromIran in covering his tracks after the hijacking.   The court heard transcripts of two calls Hamadi made from Iranto his older brother Abbas, who was living in West Germany. Theyindicated Hamadi was in Iran for at least three months after thehijacking.   In a telephone call from Iran on Oct. 13, 1985, Mohammed Hamaditold his brother he was going back to Beirut the next day but AbbasHamadi warned him he would be arrested because he was wanted byU.S. authorities.   ``We're going on a military plane to Syria and then we're takinga military car to Beirut,'' Mohammed Hamadi said.   When Abbas Hamadi asked him who told him that, Mohammed Hamadireplied: ``The Revolutionary Guards told me,'' referring to Iran'sparamilitary troops.   Prosecutors say Mohammed Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah, aradical Lebanese Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran that isbelieved to be holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. Hamadi hasdenied being a member of the group.   Hamadi was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport, whencustoms inspectors found explosives in his luggage. He went ontrial here after West Germany refused a U.S. extradition request.   In April, a West German court sentenced Abbas Hamadi to 13 yearsin prison for kidnapping two West German businessmen in Beirut inan unsuccessful bid to gain his brother's release from prison.</TEXT></DOC>
