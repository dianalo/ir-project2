The letter, signed by a wide range of lawmakers, expresses concern for employees and policyholders of B.A.T's U.S. units, Batus Inc., and Farmer's Group Inc., the California insurer.    The letter itself doesn't threaten any legislative action against the proposed transaction. But it does underscore the increasing sentiment in Congress against foreign takeovers and highly leveraged takeovers in general.    &quot;Goldsmith and his financial supporters have served notice on American workers, consumers, policyholders and policy makers that the use of debt to finance highly leveraged transactions has no limits,&quot; the letter said.    &quot;Thousands of communities across America will be hurt by this hostile bid,&quot; said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), one of the letter's authors.    The letter's co-author, Sen. Wendell Ford (D., Ky.), called for a General Accounting Office investigation and a determination on whether the Securities and Exchange Commission could &quot;assert jurisdiction&quot; over the bid.    The bid for the British tobacco, retail and insurance concern must win U.S. regulatory approval for the acquisition of Farmer's Group, which Sir James's group plans to sell. Sir James said: &quot;I am shocked that 200 people would sign a letter attacking us without a single one of those people checking with us as to its accuracy or validity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
