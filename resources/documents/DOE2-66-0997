In 1984, staffat Applied Management Sciences began to investigate the use of genericsoftware, such as the electronic spreadsheet, for analyzing complex energyeconomic issues. The use of LOTUS 1-2-3/sup TM/ spreadsheet softwarefor a major modeling application, utilizing a first principles approach,was demonstrated. The Office of Fossil Energy, working with staff fromApplied Management Sciences and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, embarkedupon the development of a planning framework which would allow R andD program decisions to be made in conjunction with data and analyseson long-term energy markets and energy demand for different fuel types.In this way, R and D programs could be targeted toward technologies whichshowed promise of producing fuels which could ultimately compete. TheR and D could also be oriented toward developing these technologies overa suitable timeframe which would allow the mature technology to enterthe market at the appropriate time. To assist in meeting these planningneeds, the R and D Analysis Modeling System (RAMS), and the initial componentof RAMS, a world oil model known as RAMSOIL, was developed.</TEXT></DOC>
