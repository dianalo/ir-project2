Bush also said he had told President Alfredo Cristiani of ElSalvador that a fair trail must be held for Jennifer Casolo, theConnecticut church worker arrested after ammunition and explosiveswere found buried in her yard in San Salvador.   Salvadoran Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas had said on Sundaythat U.S. officials had resorted to ``psychological torment'' andbrainwashing in an effort to induce the woman, Luisa Cerna, toretract her story.   A lawyer for an association of American Jesuits, R. ScottGreathead, said Ms. Cerna withdrew her statement implicating theArmy under pressure from her American and Salvadoran interrogators.   Ms. Cerna, a housekeeper for the Jesuits, first said she sawarmed men dressed in military uniform enter the rectory of theCentral American University on Nov. 16, when the Jesuits werekilled. She was flown to Miami on Nov. 23 at her request and thatof the Spanish and French ambassadors in El Salvador.   During a question-and-answer session with newspaper editors,Bush said he checked into news accounts of the case and was assuredMs. Cerna had not been mistreated.   ``And I don't think that people would tell me something that'snot true there because there would be a price to pay for that,'' hesaid.   ``I have confidence that our Attorney General would not permitthe kind of inquisition process that was alluded to in the paperstoday.''   Some of those accounts said Ms. Cerna had failed lie detectortests.   Bush added that he expects that details of the case will bereleased so long as they do not jeopardize the legal proceedingsnow under way.   On the Casolo case, Bush said, ``So far I have no received anyindictation that she will not receive a fair trial.''   Some presidential spokesmen have suggested that the Salvadorqangovernment had a case against the woman in view of the largequantity of munitions dug up around her house on Nov. 26. Somecongressional Democrats have criticized those comments.   Bush did not mention those exchanges. He said he had spoken toboth Cristiani and the U.S. ambassador, William Walker, ``torepresent to the Salvadorans that it's essential that a fair trialbe granted,'' and be seen to be fair.   Ms. Casolo's associates and family insist she has been framed.She is being held for 90 days during an investigation.   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher deniedthe allegations that Ms. Cerna had been forced to recant``absolutely and unequivocally.'' He said there have been ``manymisinformed and unsubstantiated statements'' that have served tosuggest that the U.S. government wants to discredit the witness'stestimony. ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said.   Boucher said it appears the archbishop had not been given thefacts of the case, adding that the administration has a deepcommitment to uncover the truth.   ``We are doing everything possible to help the Salvadorans findthe killers and bring them to justice,'' he said. ``We expect thiscase to be investigated fully and promptly, and that thoseimplicated by the investigation will be prosecuted. We have madethis entirely clear to President Cristiani and to the armedforces.''   He said a State Department official witnessed all theinterviews, which were carried out by a U.S.-trained Salvadoranspecial investigative unit and by agents of the FBI.   At the conclusion of Ms. Cerna's questioning, she was turnedover to the Jesuits.   During the time she was under U.S. government protection, thechurch was given free access to her and never mentioned to U.S.officials any allegation of mistreatment, he said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a letter toSalvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani expressing concern overreports of systematic mistreatment of American religious workers inEl Salvador.   He asked Cristiani to give his personal attention to the welfareof these workers.   There have been reports that one such worker, Josephine Beecher,was tortured recently by Salvadoran police. A group of religiousleaders said two weeks ago the U.S. government has not beenaggressive enough in preventing Salvadoran officials from engagingin the reported abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
