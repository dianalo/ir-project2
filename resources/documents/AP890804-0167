House leaders scrambled to muster enough Republican votes tocompensate for defecting Democrats unhappy with the pact. Opposingthe deal were three influential committee chairmen, Reps. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., of the Ways and Means Committee; John D.Dingell, D-Mich., of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and LeonPanetta, D-Calif., of the Budget Committee.   The Senate planned to vote on the deal first, with leadersexpecting passage by a wide margin. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash., said despite opposition within his own party he waspushing for enactment in time to allow Congress to leave for itssummer vacation at the end of the day.   ``I think this bill needs to be passed,'' Foley said. ``This isa compromise that we didn't prefer to make, but because thepresident has been adamant ... we had to deal with that.''   Aides said they had collected signatures from 28 of the 55 Housedelegates to a conference committee that worked out the compromiselate Thursday night with help from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman.   That was just enough to move the plan to the House floor, butthere were other procedural hurdles to be overcome before the Housecould act today.   Foley said the compromise plan for financing the bailout willcost more than the method originally proposed by Democrats. But, headded, ``If we delay it or defeat it, that will cost money.''   The compromise would cost each American taxpayer an averagetotal of $1,000 over 30 years.   The administration and Congress long ago agreed on the mostimportant elements of the landmark bill, which will close or mergehundreds of insolvent savings institutions hemorrhaging losses atan estimated $20 million a day.   It also contains a series of what Bush labeled ``never again''provisions designed to prevent the recurrence of what analystsdescribe as the worst financial crisis since the wave of bankfailures in the 1930s.   In the key reform, savings and loan owners will be required toraise billions of dollars of their own capital to discourage riskyinvestments and act as a cushion between future losses andgovernment deposit insurance funds.   Thrift institutions will be channeled back into home mortgagelending and away from speculative commercial real estate venturesand high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.   The bill also gives the Justice Department $75 million a year toroot out fraud at financial institutions, permits banks for thefirst time to buy healthy institutions in the rival thriftindustry, and enacts the most sweeping restructuring of theregulatory bureaucracy in five decades.   The agency overseeing Sandamp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,will be dismantled, with one piece wrapped into the TreasuryDepartment and the other coming under the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures commercial bank deposits.   While taxpayers will bear most of the bailout, the savingsindustry also is contributing through higher deposit insurancepremiums.   A dispute between the White House and congressional Democratsover how to account for the taxpayer funds was the last snag.   Shrugging off a morning veto threat, the House at middayThursday voted 221-199 to approve the legislation with its ownfinancing plan. But by evening, the bill bogged down in the Senate.   Senators voted 54-46 in favor of the House financing proposal,but fell six votes short of the 60-vote majority required under theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.   That sent the bill to a House-Senate conference, which after 2{hours of talks endorsed a compromise offered by four of the fiveSenate delegates.   Thursday night's compromise was a hybrid of two conflictingplans to evade automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.Democrats wanted to avoid the cuts by waiving the law.   The Bush administration would have borrowed rescue money througha private agency, keeping the spending out of the budget.   The compromise calls for raising $20 billion this year along thelines Democrats had suggested, ballooning the 1989 deficit from anestimated $148 billion to $168 billion, the highest in three years.However, spending cuts would not be triggered because the deadlinefor meeting spending targets has passed.   The remaining $30 billion would be borrowed ``off-budget'' in1990 and 1991 as Bush wanted and will not show up in the deficit.   Darman questioned whether regulators could spend $20 billionbefore the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept. 30, but he calledthe compromise ``conceptually sound.''</TEXT></DOC>
