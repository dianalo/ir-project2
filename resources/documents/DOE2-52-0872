<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0872 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study has been conducted to investigate the effect of the heat stresson the lifetime of surface-mount-devices (SMD) under the saturated pressurecooker test (PCT). It is found that the lifetime in the saturated PCTis strongly affected by the heat stress to which the devices are subjectedprior to testing. This phenomenon is described qualitatively by a simplemodel in terms of the formation of a gap between the lead frame and thepolymer resin in the device and the higher moisture absorption rate inthe saturated PCT. It is suggested that unsaturated PCT be used for accuratelyestimating the lifetime of SMDs. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
