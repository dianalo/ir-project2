The failed banks and their assets were: United Mercantile Bank, Shreveport, La., $67.3 million; Northwest Bank, Dallas, $57.1 million; Sam Houston National Bank of Walker County, Huntsville, Texas, $38.2 million; Louisiana Commercial Bank, Madisonville, La., $31.1 million; Williston Basin State Bank, Williston, N.D., $12.3 million; and Cedar Vale State Bank, Cedar Vale, Kan., $11.9 million.    As of last night, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had found other banks to take over the offices and deposits of all of these failed institutions except Sam Houston. Regulators said they were continuing to look for an institution to take over its deposits.    United Mercantile's six offices are to open today as branches of Hibernia National Bank, New Orleans, which assumes its $70.1 million in deposits and will purchase much of its assets.    Northwest Bank's two offices become branches of American Bank of Haltom City, Texas, which takes over its $50.3 million in insured deposits. The FDIC held its assets, saying their value was unclear.    Pontchartrain State Bank, Metairie, La. takes over Louisiana Commercial Bank's two offices, its $28.7 million in deposits and all of its assets.    Cedar Vale's office opens as a branch of Chisholm Trail State Bank, Wichita, Kan., which assumes its $11.5 million in deposits and some of its assets.    Williston Basin's office becomes a branch of First National Bank andamp; Trust Co., also of Williston, which takes over its $12.1 million in deposits. </TEXT></DOC>
