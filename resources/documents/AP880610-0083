A Western television networkreported that the ailing patriarch may be dying.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, saidParliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani conferred Wednesday withAyatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri in the holy city of Qom, 100 milessouth of Tehran. The agency said that President Ali Khamenei alsosaw Montazeri in Qom on Thursday.   In both cases, the agency said the two political leadersdiscussed current issues, but it did not elaborate.   Rafsanjani and Khamenei are political rivals in the powerstruggle that has been taking place in the Tehran hierarchy overwho will run the country when Khomeini dies.   The 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch has been reported infrail health since he suffered a heart attack two years ago. Therehave also been unconfirmed reports that he has cancer.   Iran's official media have made no recent reference toKhomeini's health.   The CBS television network reported Thursday that intelligencereports indicated Khomeini ``may now be very close to death.''   It quoted the reports as saying that ``the Ayatollah's cancerhas spread from his prostate to his liver'' and that he ``may onlyhave two or three months to live.''   It also reported that U.S. intelligence officials say Montazeriwould succeed Khomeini but the real power would be wielded byRafsanjani.   Speculation that the Iranian leader's condition wasdeteriorating heightened when he appointed Rafsanjani, also one ofhis closest aides, as acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armedforces on June 2.   Khomeini had held that title under Iran's revolutionaryconstitution.   His appointment of Rafsanjani followed two recent battlefielddefeats that Iran suffered in its nearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.   Khomeini, who last week declared the war would be won on thebattlefield and not at the negotiating table, ordered Rafsanjani toreorganize Iran's fractious military forces.   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani assaying June 3 that it was no longer possible for Khomeini ``topersonally run the administrative affairs'' of Iran's variousmilitary forces.   He did not elaborate but added: ``We should not have suchexpectations of his Holiness.''   Rafsanjani, a 53-year-old cleric, has long been considered thesecond most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini.   He consolidated his political power with the appointment asmilitary chief and his June 7 reelection as speaker by the Majlis,or Parliament.   He also represents Khomeini on the Supreme Defense Council,which determines Iran's war strategy, maintains close links withthe Revolutionary Guards, and sits on several key committees.   Although Khomeini clearly indicated in 1985 that 65-year-oldMontazeri would succeed him, he drew up a new political testamenton Dec. 10.   Tehran Radio said it contained some changes from an earlierdocument Khomeini had written, to be opened after his death. Thecontents were not disclosed.   Montazeri has been opposed by several Iranian leaders, includingRafsanjani. He also lacks the charisma and authority of Khomeini.   Khomeini was last seen in public May 13 accompanied by his son,Ahmed. The national leader has rarely left his residence in thelast few years.   When the Parliament reconvened May 28, his son read a speech inthe House on behalf of his father. There was no officialexplanation of Khomeini's absence.</TEXT></DOC>
