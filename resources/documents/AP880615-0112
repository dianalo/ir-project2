The army said it wasinvestigating the report.   It was the 208th Palestinian death in the 6-month-old Arabuprising against Israel and came as Arabs shut down the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip in a daylong general strike.   An official from Beit Jalla Hospital identified the victim asNidal Ibrahim Hassan and said Israeli troops shot him in the headduring a confrontation in the village of Battir, five milesnorthwest of Bethlehem.   Arab youths had blocked roads in Battir to prevent workers fromgoing to their jobs, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. They threw stones and bottles at Israeli soldiers whoarrived at the scene, he said.   Today's strike was in solidarity with Arab students held inIsraeli jails and also came in response to a call circulated on anunderground leaflet.   Israel's army responded to the strike by stepping up patrols andclosing 16 Arab bus companies in the West Bank and Arab eastJerusalem for a week.   The army also ordered a two-day closure of West Bank schools,which military officers say are a source of renewed violence.   ``We hope these two days will serve as a hint to those studentswho want to study, to those parents who send their children toschool and to those who are behind the disturbances, so they willlet the students complete the school year,'' Brig. Gen. ShaikeErez, head of the West Bank's military administration, said onIsrael radio.   West Bank schools, a flashpoint for anti-Israeli protests duringthe Palestinian uprising, were shut down in February. Studies haveresumed gradually in the past three weeks, with high schoolstudents the last to return June 6.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, schools have remained open for mostof the uprising.   Israeli authorities closed 14 bus companies in Arab eastJerusalem for a week starting Thursday as punishment for thecompany's participation in commercial strikes, Arab reports said.   Also closed were the Ramallah Bus Company and the BethlehemNational Bus Company, the companies' owners said.   Virtually all shops were closed and most streets empty todayfrom Bethlehem to the northern city of Nablus in the West Bank andin the seaside Gaza Strip.   In Bethlehem, graffiti on walls warned in Arabic: ``Observe TheStrike, Or Else!'' Some roads were blocked by boulders. In Nablus,outlawed Palestinian flags flapped from electrical poles.   ``It is wishful thinking for the Israelis to say the uprising isdying,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, an English teacher at the West Bank'sBir Zeit University. ``To end the occupation, people are willing tosacrifice.''   On Tuesday, the army said 2,500 Arabs had been ordered held forup to six months without charges, up 500 from last month.   Army officials said they could not provide figures on how manyof the about 5,000 Arabs in Israeli jails are students. The armyhas said most administrative detainees are members of Shabibe, ayouth group linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The army also said that dozens of Israeli soldiers have beenconvicted of or charged with use of excessive force and otherviolations of army policy since the uprising began Dec. 8 in theWest Bank and Gaza.   The chief military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov, saidthat since the uprising began, military police have opened 350investigations.   About 230 investigations have been completed and dozens ofsoldiers have been convicted of or charged with violating armyregulations. Strashnov would not elaborate.   Current army policy allows soldiers to club Arabs to break updemonstrations, but prohibits beatings once a suspect is incustody. Soldiers may only open fire in self-defense.   In all, 208 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed sincethe uprising began.</TEXT></DOC>
