The torpedo, one of the Navy's primary weapons systems for the future, is considered a major plum among defense contractors. Honeywell, which has produced the torpedo's predecessor -- the Mark-46 -- for the Navy for years, has characterized the follow-on weapon as one of its largest potential revenue producers.    But should the prototype fail, or cost overruns sink the project, a flap over who's to blame is considered likely. Indeed, Honeywell already has been fighting with the Navy over who will absorb the additional costs.    Pentagon spokesmen wouldn't comment on the project. A Honeywell representative said the contractor was hopeful of resolving the problems.    Honeywell, which with Westinghouse Electric Corp. is developing the Mark-50 weapon for the Navy, said that its engineers are having trouble meeting the Pentagon's specifications and that a prototype is 8 1/2 inches longer and 20 pounds heavier than required.    Over the expected 20-year life of the system the Pentagon could spend $6.9 billion on the sophisticated weapon, which can be launched either from aircraft or ships to seek out deep-diving submarines.    Because of the development problems, the Navy now is asking for twice the number of tests when the Mark-50 is built. Initially it had ordered 38 torpedos to be tested, but now wants about 100 tests. Some will involve retrieving a tested model and refiring it.    The Pentagon estimates that the delays in designing, building and developing software for the weapon could set back testing at least a year. The company blames problems in developing guidance software as well as difficulties in building a sufficiently compact torpedo for the cost increases.    In a quarterly report to Congress, the Pentagon indicated that the Mark-50 was the only major weapons program whose costs rose since the previous report. Overall weapons programs costs increased $418 million, to $790.5 billion from $790.1 billion, the Pentagon said. The Navy recently sought to boost the torpedo's fiscal 1988 budget to $262 million from $222 million, most of which will go to Honeywell. The rest will go to Westinghouse and Navy research efforts.    Despite the design problems, Honeywell said it still expects about $26 million profit initially under its contract with the Navy.    Honeywell said it now will make 90 test torpedos. If the weapon is accepted, Honeywell and Westinghouse are expected to compete for primary production, which now may not begin before 1989. Under the Pentagon's dual-sourcing policy, the low bidder would build most of the torpedos but the loser also would make them.    A Navy spokesman describes the Mark-50 as a submarine-seeking device with superior speed, depth and endurance capabilities, detection range and warhead, compared with current weapons.    The weapon would be launched from anti-submarine helicopters and planes as well as from surface vessels.    Development of the Mark-50 began in 1983, as the Navy recognized it would need a sophisticated successor to its current submarine-seeking torpedo line. Initially the Navy asked Congress for $222 million to continue development work in fiscal 1988, but recently increased its request to $262 million as the project lagged. </TEXT></DOC>
