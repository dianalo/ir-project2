The new strategy, known as &quot;tactical asset allocation,&quot; has been embraced by high-tech practitioners who use computers to decide when to switch in and out of stocks, bonds, cash and other assets. They are betting some $20 billion of institutional customers' money on the approach.    &quot;Market timing has gone from being a dirty word to something everyone wants to buy into,&quot; says Charles DuBois, vice president of Citicorp Investment Management Inc., which manages about $1 billion in tactical asset-allocation portfolios.    Some firms recently have made tactical asset allocation available to individual investors through mutual funds. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo andamp; Co. offers one exclusively to its individual retirement account customers and advises another, distributed by Stephens Inc., Little Rock, Ark., called the Overland Express Asset Allocation Fund. PaineWebber Inc. offers the PaineWebber Asset Allocation Fund, while First Chicago Corp. and Fidelity Investments are considering asset-allocation funds or services for individuals.    These funds differ from other allocation strategies used by mutual funds or in brokerage firms' recommendations in that the process is strictly quantitative, based on valuation models that compare expected returns among various markets. When these numbers get out of whack relative to &quot;normal&quot; historical ranges, the models direct the managers to sell the assets that look expensive and buy the bargains.    This highly automated process eliminates not only stock and bond picking, since investments are made only in market indexes, but also any other judgments by portfolio managers. It follows the numbers even when the psychic pain of going against the crowd is excruciating to the managers. &quot;The discipline is just as important as the insights,&quot; says Mr. DuBois.    What's more, in contrast to other asset-allocation funds and services, which use a more balanced and diversified approach, this strategy can produce extreme asset shifts -- instructing a money manager to put as much as 100% in a single asset as the data warrant. And though it may result in adjustments only a few times a year, the process of evaluating asset mix is continuous rather than sporadic.    Tactical asset allocation has been boosted by recent successes. The handful of managers using the strategy cut clients' stock holdings before the Oct. 19 crash; indeed, some held almost no equities during the booming market of the preceeding 10 months. With the crash, though, the managers' 1987 returns beat the stock market by five to 25 percentage points.    But many market professionals -- even some adherents of tactical asset allocation -- are leery of its popularity and skeptical that the recent successes can be repeated indefinitely. They note that many studies have found that, over the long term, the risks and costs of timing strategies outweigh the rewards.    One early study, done in 1974 by William F. Sharpe, professor of finance at Stanford University, examined market data from 1934 to 1972 and found that a market timer with 2% trading costs choosing once a year between stocks and cash would have to have been right at least 82% of the time to do as well as someone using a buy-and-hold strategy in stocks.    Robert H. Jeffrey, president of Jeffrey Co., an investment firm in Columbus, Ohio, found that, for average investors with no special forecasting ability, the maximum potential losses from quarterly market timing from 1975 to 1982 were twice as large as the potential gains. The reason: &quot;All the action on the upside (in the stock market) tends to take place in a very short time&quot; -- during that period, in just 9% of the quarters. &quot;If you miss those short rallies, you might as well forget about investing in stocks,&quot; he says.    Even so, the tactical asset allocators have led some skeptics to modify their views. Prof. Sharpe, a recent co-founder of Sharpe-Tint Inc., an investment advisory firm in Los Altos, Calif., says that partly because of the crash, there is growing evidence that risk-return relationships among various investment markets can change over time. As a result, he says, buying into a market where investors have lost money can produce above-average results. This &quot;leads us to a contrarian strategy that looks like market timing,&quot; he says.    Still, Prof. Sharpe defends the conclusion of his earlier timing study. &quot;If your market-timing skills really are only average,&quot; he says, &quot;you shouldn't attempt it.&quot; Even in the case of tactical asset-allocation strategies, he says, &quot;my best estimate is that they'll work less well in the future than they have in the past.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
