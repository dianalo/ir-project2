Gigot</HL><DATE>01/10/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8</SO><NS>MANAGEMENT ISSUES (MNT)</NS><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   By towing Chrysler's Lee Iacocca (a.k.a. the $4.65million-a-year man) to Tokyo, Commerce Secretary -- er,President -- Bush has put executive pay on the table for the1992 campaign.   Democratic front-runner Bill Clinton is already firingaway at &quot;self-serving CEOs,&quot; while liberal pundits pile on.Even the Sniper of Albany, Mario Cuomo, rose from his foxholeto take a few cheap shots. So naturally all goodfree-marketeers should rise in response to defend the rightof CEOs to earn whatever . . . hold on a minute.</LP><TEXT>   Grab that jerking knee. There are good reasons other thanclass envy for disliking the runaway salaries of many chiefexecutives. Vice President Dan Quayle may even try to make ita Republican issue (more below).   For one thing, the pay numbers are outrageous enough tomake even a capitalist blush. Steven Ross, the Time Warnerboss, raked in $74.8 million in bonuses in 1990 (on top ofhis $3.3 million salary), even as Time magazine discardsemployees. Good work if you can get it. General Motors'sformer chairman, Roger Smith, receives a $1.2 million annualpension -- presumably his reward for a decade of losingmarket share.   The averages aren't much more reassuring than the horrorstories. A survey by Graef Crystal, the walking encyclopediaof executive pay, shows that, in the mid1970s, CEOs earnedabout 34 times the pay of the average working stiff; by thelate 1980s they earned an eye-popping 109 times that average.   Windfalls might be justified when companies do well; BillGates of wealth-creating Microsoft deserves his billion instock. But the trouble is the bonuses keep coming even forCEOs in sinking companies (Chrysler).   The sole pleasure from Mr. Bush's disastrous Japan triphas been seeing the American CEOs embarrassed by thecomparatively modest incomes of the Japanese. Honda's CEOmakes less than $400,000 and great cars. Americans arelearning that Japan's hierarchical society has produced amore egalitarian corporation than radically egalitarianAmerica; somehow this has to influence corporate esprit,worker morale, and thus performance.   Liberals like to attribute all this to &quot;greed,&quot; lowertaxes and (who else]) Ronald Reagan. And it's never wise todiscount greed in human affairs. But truly free markets havea way of disciplining greed when it doesn't mesh withresults. The real problem is that the &quot;market&quot; in CEO paydoesn't work. Says Mr. Crystal: &quot;A true market is one thatallocates resources efficiently. There is no market incorporate pay.&quot;   Compare, he says, CEOs to baseball players. He cites astudy by a Securities and Exchange Commission economistshowing that 75% of the salary differences in baseball can beexplained by differences in performance -- home runs, earnedrun average and the like. But his own survey of 459 CEOscould explain only about 20% of their salary disparities bycomparing performance (company size and total return toshareholders). &quot;The other 80% is anyone's guess,&quot; he says.   In short, the year Chrysler makes a car as well as RogerClemens throws a fastball is the year Mr. Iacocca willdeserve to make $4.65 million.   The reason for this market failure goes beyond the factthat CEOs choose, and are cosy with, their boards ofdirectors. The more fundamental problem is the lack of CEOaccountability to their shareholders (owners).   The 1980s may have started as the decade of the takeover,but they ended as the decade of entrenched management. TheDelaware Chancery court has ruled that directors aren'tobliged to accept bids for their shares (another Time Warnercontribution). And the pillorying of both junk bonds andMichael Milken didn't make it easier to finance takeovers.Many CEOs are increasingly accountable only to themselves.   What to do? The quick and dirty solution is to slap alimit on CEO salaries. It's especially tempting to do thisfor companies which demand government trade protection --machine tool and car makers -- but want to go on fat andflush in the executive suite. The latter idea was floated(though rejected) during the latest debate over machine-toolprotection in the Bush Administration. But pay limits, whichare really price controls, never work.   More promising reforms may be emerging from SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden. Earlier this year he proposed &quot;a shareholderbill of rights&quot; that would loosen proxy rules to make iteasier to mount shareholder challenges.   This idea sank out of sight, though, following thepredictable howl from the plutocrats at the BusinessRoundtable. The Brady Treasury, which sometimes acts as if itrepresents only the Business Roundtable, was also wary.   But the proposal may now be getting a new life thanks toVice President Quayle. His staff is working with Mr. Breedento come up with ideas for greater corporate accountability.&quot;The vice president is very interested in this and believesthat CEOs, like everyone else, should be accountable in ourcapitalist system, and that means rewarded for goodperformance and punished for failure,&quot; says an administrationsource familiar with the discussions   Such a proposal would also be good politics. PresidentBush needs a populist economic agenda to rebut Democraticcharges that he is indifferent to the middle class.Identifying Mr. Bush with such overpaid whiners as Mr.Iacocca is crazy. Standing up for millions of shareholdersand workers to make Mr. Iacocca more accountable makes moresense.</TEXT></DOC>
