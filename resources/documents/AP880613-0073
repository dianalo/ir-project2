(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists plan to turn a green cornfieldinto a laboratory this month to test a genetically alteredmicroorganism in hopes of killing a caterpillar that costs Americanfarmers about $400 million a year.   Proponents call testing of the microorganism Cxc-Bt a steptoward a new era of chemical-free pest control. Critics worry thatgenetically engineered materials will spread uncontrollably oncereleased into the environment.   The microorganism will be injected into corn stalks to combatthe European corn borer, one of agriculture's most destructivepests.   Although researchers have conducted other experiments ofgenetically altered materials in the environment, the tests will bethe first approved for a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,''said the microbe's creator, Peter Carlson, chief scientist of CropGenetics International Inc.   ``If Crop Genetics is successful, this time or in future tests _and there are similiar developments going on all over the place _this will be a significant step forward in the production offood,'' said Richard D. Godown, a Washington-based lobbyist for theindustry.   Biotechnology industry officials say Cxc-Bt is just the edge ofa ``gene revolution'' that could dramatically boost crop productionand help feed a world population expected to double in the next 40years, while cleaning up the environment.   But the industry's main critic says the field tests, which willbegin June 20, are part of a dangerous trend to unleash hundreds ofsimiliar products without evolutionary defenses against them.   And, said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-basedFoundation on Economic Trends, the pesticide doesn't work.   ``If they develop a niche, you're stuck with them,'' Rifkinsaid. ``They mutate, they migrate, they have mobility _ you can'trecall them.''   Environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society andthe Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited fieldtests approved in May, and officials say if their questions aboutspread are answered with more tests, they may support the finalproduct.   The crucial question for environmental groups is whether therewill be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just thebeginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiarproducts, said Maureen Hinkle, the Audubon Society's director ofagricultural policy.   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' she said. ``If it works, it will be atremendous boon.''   Whether Cxc-Bt will work is another question.   Rifkin said the microbe approved for limited field tests by theEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculturedoesn't kill corn borers outside the petri dish and is being usedby the biotechnical industry to set precedent.   Field tests of Cxc without Bt produced yields that were 17percent below normal, Rifkin said. The Environmental Defense Fundalso said Cxc can lower corn yields. But Carlson said the averagecorn yield at 33 test sites was on par with farmers', and onlyseven showed reduced yield, including one patch with a 17 percentdrop.   The organism being tested did not kill the corn borer outrightbut sickened it, Carlson said. ``It's easier to get approval fortesting a recombinant microbe if it's not a sledgehammer,'' he said.   He hopes his product will weaken the caterpillars and thennatural forces, such as disease, that were not present ingreenhouse tests, will kill the moth larvae. Crop Genetics also isworking on an improved form of Cxc-Bt that could kill the cornborer outright, as well as products to combat cotton, rice andsoybean pests, he said.   Concerned about insect transmission, the EPA is requiring thetest patches in Queen Anne's County and Beltsville be sprayedagainst insects.   Rebecca Goldburg, an Environmental Defense Fund biologist, saidthe New York-based environmental group is not convinced Carlson'sbug will work or is safe enough, but the possibility of analternative to chemical pesticides is heartening and worth pursuing.   ``I believe there is a potential for some genetically engineeredorganisms to cause some ecological problems,'' Ms. Goldburg said.``Lots of genetically engineered organisms won't cause anyproblems. What we have to believe is that we have the ability tosay yes to some and no to others.''   Only one other genetic crop-protector, a microbe altered tofight frost, has been approved for field testing by theEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA spokesman Albert Heier said.   A Montana State University researcher injected a geneticallyaltered bacteria into 14 elm trees in an effort to block Dutch elmdisease, but he cut them down in 1987 after officials learned heconducted the experiment without federal or university approval.</TEXT></DOC>
