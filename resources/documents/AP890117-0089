RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a case of particularinterest to lawyers and civil rights activists, today agreed toreview a $181,000 attorneys' fee award stemming from a 1970 airlinesex bias lawsuit.   The justices said they will decide whether people who intervenein civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ maybe forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those whosuccessfully sue.   The case stems from a 1970 suit that challenged the policy ofTrans World Airlines to fire female flight attendants when theybecame mothers.   The policy was attacked as illegal sex discrimination barred byTitle VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.   A nine-year legal battle was resolved in 1979 when TWA agreed toreinstate fired women with seniority from the date of theirdismissal. The airline, which had abandoned its ``no-motherhood''policy soon after the suit was filed, also created a $3 million fundfor the fired attendants.   The settlement was challenged by the Independent Federation ofFlight Attendants on behalf of TWA flight attendants who couldsuffer from the lawsuit's settlement by being laid off in favor ofthose with the newly won seniority.   The union acted as an intervenor in the suit, interjecting itselfas a concerned third party rather than as either defendant orplaintiff.   The union's challenge to the settlement proved unsuccessful, andlast May the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the union toreimburse the women who won the suit $180,915 in legal fees.   The appeals court noted that the union argued ``that because itintervened solely to assert the rights of its non-discriminatingincumbent members, it should be viewed in practical terms as aplaintiff and hence assessed attorneys' fees only if it itsopposition to the settlement was found to have been groundless.''   But the appeals court said the union's reasoning ``couldsubstantially undermine'' a federal law aimed at giving citizens anincentive to challenge unlawful discrimination by assuring theirlegal costs will be reimbursed if they win.   ``We are not inclined to look favorably upon such a potentiallyinjurious exception to this long-standing legislative scheme,'' theappeals court said.   The fact that the women who sued were awarded more than $1.25million in legal fees from TWA does not let the union off the hook,the appeals court added.   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the union said the 7th Circuitcourt ruling conflicts with decisions by other federal appealscourts.   The union also said that it only was fulfilling itsresponsibility to its members when it challenged the settlement tothe suit.   Hundreds of TWA flight attendants were laid off beginning inOctober 1979 when a recession hit the airline industry, the unionsaid. It said some would have been able to keep their jobs were itnot for the settlement that awarded seniority to the fired women whosued TWA.   The high court's ruling in the case, expected by July, willaffect numerous suits in which violations of civil andconstitutional rights are alleged.   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs.Zipes, 88-608.</TEXT></DOC>
