Moser and Susan FisherandM;The legal cloud hanging over the dBASE database market for three years wasfinally lifted last week as Borland International Inc. dropped theAshton-Tate dBASE copyright lawsuit against Fox Software Inc.andM;In the wake of the Justice Department's approval of Borland's $440 millionacquisition of Ashton-Tate, Borland CEO Philippe Kahn and Fox President DavidFulton agreed to end the legal battle, which began in November 1988.andP;  At thattime, Ashton-Tate sued Fox, alleging that FoxBASE infringed on Ashton-Tate'sdBASE programming language.andP;  Fox claimed that the dBASE language was notcopyrightable.andM;As part of its acquisition of Ashton-Tate, Borland and the Justice Departmentnegotiated a consent decree under which Borland, of Scotts Valley, Calif.,andO;agreed not to assert copyright claims on the dBASE programming language.andM;The agreement reflects the department's desire to keep the database marketcompetitive, rather than addressing any specific concern with the issue ofintellectual property rights, legal experts said.andP;  If Borland had not droppedthe suit against Fox Software, the experts noted, Borland would be takingstands on both sides of the issue.andP;  Borland would have been demandingprotection for on-screen menus in the Fox suit, while attacking LotusDevelopment Corp. for claiming similar rights in Lotus' suit regardingBorland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet.andM;Client/Server Battle LoomsandM;With the all-clear sign from the Justice Department, Borland is set to enterthe client/server fray against such formidable opponents as Oracle Corp.,andO;Informix Software Inc. and Ingres Corp., armed with what Kahn termed &quot;thejewel in the crown,&quot; Ashton-Tate's Interbase (see story, Page 5).andP;  Littleelse remains of Ashton-Tate.andP;  Borland will employ only 800 of the 1,700employees who were with Ashton-Tate in June, and will close its Torrance,Calif., headquarters over the next six months.andP;  The costs associated with theacquisition will be higher than the $80 million previously anticipated, saidKahn, but Borland officials would not say how much more.andM;Meanwhile, Borland officials last week also defended recent statements theymade touting the U.S.andP;  Copyright Office's &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief filedin Lotus' copyright suit against Borland.andM;&quot;We stand by what we said,&quot; said Borland spokesman Dick O'Donnell.andP;  &quot;We areencouraged by what andlsqb;the Copyright Officeandrsqb; said.andP;  We believe they are in syncwith our philosophy on copyrightability.&quot;andM;The Justice Department, which filed the brief on the Copyright Office'sbehalf, has suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &quot;maywish to investigate&quot; Borland's comments.andM;On Oct.andP;  1, after Borland officials made those remarks, Borland's stock rose7.2 percent to $50.25, while Lotus' fell 5.3 percent to $31.50.andP;  As of Oct.andO;16, Borland's stock was at $48.62, Lotus' at $31.50.andM;In a letter to the SEC, the Justice Department noted that the Register ofCopyright did not advocate a particular conclusion to the Lotus-Borland case.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
