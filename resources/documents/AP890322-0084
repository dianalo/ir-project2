SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parliament today opened discussions onconstitutional changes to create a freely elected Senate and toenact other reforms developed at talks between the communistgovernment and the opposition.   ``The model of economy and way of wielding power adopted in the'40s ceased to fulfil its function,'' Jan Kaczmarek, a CommunistParty deputy, told the parliament, or Sejm. ``Our goal is to build agood basis for social democracy.''   The parliament will also consider the creation of laws onelections, independent political organizations and unions.   During the debate, the communist-allied Democratic Party demandeda separate law to regulate political parties. The Constitution doesnot mention the possibility of political parties forming, other thanthose named as part of a communist-controlled ``coalition.''   Several political clubs have sprung up, and they say they wouldlike to act as independent political parties.   Following the first formal readings of the new legislation today,the bills are to be handed over to committees that will considerthem for several weeks and add amendments suggested by thegovernment as a result of the talks.   Because the Sejm is controlled by the Communist Party, anylegislation agreed upon by the party leadership is assured ofpassage.   The constitutional changes are part of an unprecedentedcompromise government and opposition leaders are negotiating at thetalks that began Feb. 6 and are scheduled to end April 3 with thesigning of a new ``social contract'' to set Poland's future course.   In exchange for restoring Solidarity's status as the firstindependent trade union in the East Bloc, the communist governmenthopes for a period of political stability that will improve chancesfor economic recovery _ controls have already been loosened onprivate entrepreneurs _ and make Western lenders sympathetic toPoland's staggering foreign debt and current investment needs.   Under the planned accord, Solidarity and other now-bannedopposition groups would agree to take part in elections to theparliament in which the governing coalition is still guaranteed towin at least 65 percent of the 460 seats.   But a new Senate would be created to which elections would bedemocratic. For the first time in the communist bloc, anyone wouldbe free to run and directly compete against communist candidates.   In turn, an office of the president, with strong powers, would becreated. The president would be elected by the Sejm and the Senate,and the Communist Party could be expected to obtain the office dueto its Sejm majority.   In January, the Communist Party leadership decided in principleto legalize Solidarity, banned since the imposition of martial lawin December 1981.   Solidarity, led by Lech Walesa, then agreed to participate in thetalks with the government, first proposed by authorities during asevere wave of labor unrest in August.</TEXT></DOC>
