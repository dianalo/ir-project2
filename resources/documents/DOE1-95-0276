Less commonly, they cause headaches and transientor progressive focal neurologic deficits. Consecutive autopsy data show,however, that asymptomatic ICVMs are actually many times more commonthan symptomatic ones. Asymptomatic ICVMs are often never detected. Recognitionof ICVMs is further hindered by the fact that cerebral angiography andcomputed tomography are normal in many cases. A review is given of thecerebral angiograms, and the CT and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)scans in a group of patients with ICVM to study the role of NMR in makingthe diagnosis. 5 refs.; 1 figure.
