The current stocks of coal andfuel oil far exceed those prescribed by law and in the interim considerablestockpiles of natural gas have been established. The current favourableprice situation on the oil markets should in the opinion of the FederalGovernment, and of its EEC and IEA partners, be used to improve suppliesin case of breakdowns in supply. Thus the government has decided to increasethe level of the stockpiles held by the oil stockpiling association byat least 10 days. Further increases, such as in the federal crude oilreserve for example, are not envisaged. As a result of the decline inthe consumption of petroleum the scope of these reserves has increasedautomatically from 16 days consumption in 1980 to 24 days. This shouldnot change significantly even in the future. The national coal reservewill however be disposed of by 1993 at the latest. The Federal Governmentis also of the opinion that existing stocks in the petroleum, hard coal,natural gas and electricity areas (including uranium) are sufficientto ensure supplies for an adequate period even in the event of a majorinterruption of supplies. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
