Organizers said the fifth round of the other semifinal betweenJan Timman of the Netherlands and British Grandmaster Jon Speelmanwould be played as scheduled Sunday night.   Each semifinalist is allowed to take one timeout during theeight-game contests. Yusupov, who trails 1.5-2.5, is the first ofthe four candidates' to do so.   A win scores one point and a draw one-half point.   Timman led Speelman 2-1 with an unfinished game from the fourthround Saturday. Play in the adjourned game was scheduled to resumeon Monday.   The winners of the semifinals will face off in the final inMarch. The winner of that series will challenge world championGarri Kasparov in a 24-game match in October 1990.   Yusupov will use the extra time to prepare for the fifth game,in which he will open with the advantage of the white pieces.   But the free days will also permit Karpov, playing below par inLondon despite his lead, time to try to recover his form.</TEXT></DOC>
