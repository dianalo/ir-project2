(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Network Adapter CardsandM;Local area network builders often go to extremes, either buying everythingfrom one vendor or following the roll-your-own technique.andP;  Somewhere betweenthose two extremes lies the Chinese menu approach, which customizes LANchoices by picking one from column A and two from column B.andM;The network adapter card plays a role in all three of these methods ofLAN-building.andP;  However, novices understandably feel bewildered by theconflicting descriptions and confusing trade names of five dozen cardmanufacturers, who produce as many as 15 cards each.andM;To understand the universal role of the adapter card in network design, it isessential to start from the basics: LAN topology, cabling, data rate andplatform.andM;LAN builders also need to understand the number of users, the applicationsthey will run, the dissimilar networks with which they will interface and anyinterconnections to the outside world via wide-area networking.andM;Only after all these considerations have been firmed up is it time to decideon the best adapter card.andP;  Picking a vendor is the very last step.andM;Common network topologies today include Ethernet, star, token-ring, Arcnetand fiber-optic.andP;  A few proprietary bus topologies also exist, but unlessthey are fully compatible with an accepted standard protocol, they cannotcommunicate with dissimilar networks.andM;Each of these topologies has its advantages.andP;  A topology is analogous to aprotocol standard.andP;  Generally speaking, topology selection dictates theprotocol, data rates and cabling type.andM;The Ethernet topology, originally developed by Xerox Corp., is perhaps themost popular standard, available from virtually all network adapter cardvendors.andM;Ethernet uses coaxial cabling.andP;  It works in a bus topology with data rates upto 10 megabits/sec.andP;  Bus topologies resemble parallel electrical circuits:even if one station on the bus fails, the others continue to function.andO;Ethernet cards conform to IEEE standard 802.3.andM;Token-RingandM;The next most popular topology is token-ring, originally developed by IBMCorp.andP;  True token-ring cards must conform to IEEE standard 802.5 at aminimum.andP;  Token-ring works somewhat like a serial electrical circuit.andP;  Unlesseach station on the ring operates, the ring as a whole will fail.andP;  Data rateson token-ring go up to about 4 megabits/sec.andP;  Cabling may be twisted-pair.andM;Star and Arcnet topologies, pioneered by ATandamp;T Co. and Standard MicrosystemsCorp. respectively, use a central hub concept, with each workstationconnected to the hub.andP;  Star configurations can run up to 10 megabits/sec,while Arcnet LANs are slower, running at only 2.5 megabits/sec.andM;The Arcnet protocol also can run in a bus configuration.andP;  Some Arcnets usefiber-optic physical cabling.andM;The fiber-optic topology is the least well-defined of all topologies, exceptfor its cabling, which of course consists of glass fiber.andM;Some fiber-optic vendors such as 10Net Communications use the Carrier SenseMultiple Access Protocol, calling for two fiber cables, one for transmittingand one for receiving.andM;From a physical standpoint, this approach resembles the star topology becauseit requires hubs.andP;  The data rate is 10 megabits/sec.andM;Another vendor, Simplenet Systems, has a fiber-optic adapter card with a datarate of 100 megabits/sec using the emerging Fiber Distributed Data Interfaceprotocol.andP;  Simplenet's topology is token-ring-like without hubs.andM;Of all these topologies, Ethernet is the best defined, best supported andhighest in performance, as well as the most expensive.andP;  Ethernet definesseveral layers for external connection to a variety of dissimilar networkprotocols.andP;  Ethernet is recommended for internetworking environments.andM;Fiber optics excels when security or high electrical noise is aconsideration.andP;  A fiber-optic LAN is virtually noise-immune and impervious toexternal tampering.andM;Also, fiber optics usually costs less to install than copper cabling becauseit needs no expensive shielded conduit.andP;  However, the cost per foot ofoptical fiber differs little from coax.andM;Star or token-ring configurations work well for individual work groups, eachwith its own data, that need to communicate among themselves from time totime.andP;  Token-ring clusters can be interconnected on an Ethernet backbone.andO;Today's networks must be able to access and present information to users asif it resided on their own workstations.andM;Distributed database applications have entirely different requirements.andP;  Inboth cases, however, those who design the network must consider therelationship between servers and workstations.andM;That relationship falls into two basic categories: central server andpeer-to-peer.andP;  In a central server network, all data and program files resideon the server.andP;  Applications loaded into a workstation's memory seek theirdata from the server.andM;Access RightsandM;The main difference between this arrangement and the peer-to-peerconfiguration is that any workstation also can be a server in thepeer-to-peer network.andP;  When a workstation holds an application or data,others on the network can use it if it has shareable access rights.andM;But in a central server configuration, the server is a dedicated machine witha complex system of disk and directory sharing.andM;All users access the server as if it were their own private fixed disk.andP;  Theability to share files must be assigned by the network administrator.andM;In distributed clusters, data stored on servers within individual clustersmay be accessed by one or more users in external but interconnected clusters.andO;This distributed condition demands great sophistication from the network andapplication software.andP;  Network topology affects distributed clusters onlyslightly.andM;Where's the Bottleneck?andM;LAN bottlenecks usually appear first at the fixed disk.andP;  Slowdowns in datatransfer or system response time may result from badly written networkapplications, too many users attempting to access the disk at the same timeor excessive data on the disk.andP;  In any case, the first response is to addanother server and split the data load.andM;A second and less common point of stress in a large LAN lies in the &quot;wire&quot; ornetwork transmission medium.andP;  Although many users believe that very fast datatransfer rates are a must for large networks, that belief may not bejustified.andM;Consider what data rate actually means in terms of overall networkperformance.andP;  The typical AT workstation runs somewhere between 8 MHz and 16MHz, with a megahertz equaling a million cycles per second.andP;  But the typicalfast fixed disk has an average data access time of 28 milliseconds, muchslower than the workstation's bus speed.andP;  So the limiting factor is notnecessarily the data transfer rate on the wire.andM;However, it is true that the faster the data transfer rate, the faster agiven user's data can move between workstation and server, making room foranother user to move data.andM;The benefit of increased data transfer rate shows up in the number ofsimultaneous users, or user accesses in network-intensive applications, notin the individual user/network response.andM;A big, multiuser network may benefit from Ethernet's fast data rates, butexperienced network managers say it is difficult to use up all the2.5-megabit/sec to 5-megabit/sec capacity found in average-sized LANs.andM;Furthermore, network size in this case relates to users on a given server.andO;Because users of a distributed network do not all share each other's serverson a regular basis, only the worst case need be considered.andM;If both LANs share the same network protocol, internetworking is simple, butmaking an Ethernet LAN talk to a token-ring LAN is a bit more difficult.andM;The degree to which a network needs to internetwork, and with what othertopologies, heavily influences the choice of topology and thus the choice ofnetwork adapter card.andM;The open systems approach taken by IBM's OS/2 LAN Manager greatly easesinternetworking.andP;  Some implementations of LAN Manager, for example 3ComCorp.'s 3+ Open, use the Ethernet topology and the transport layer as aninternetworking software device.andM;In most cases, Ethernet's transport layer can facilitate some form ofinternetworking between dissimilar networks.andP;  However, beyond the Ethernettopology, the issue usually becomes software.andM;Complete InternetworkingandM;A few vendors, notably 10Net, offer complete internetworking without Ethernet-- in 10Net's case, through the use of bridges.andM;A bridge is a hardware/software device that interconnects two topologiestransparently to both.andP;  10Net provides a variety of internet bridges as wellas TCP/IP for connection to such diverse environments as Xenix.andM;About a year ago, a report on office automation by Dalton CommunicationsInc., New York, compared the relative costs of several LAN topologies on aper-user basis.andP;  Eight users were assumed.andM;Dalton estimated that single users on AT-class machines would spend $3,402per user.andM;However, an eight-user Novell Inc. network using Ethernet cost $3,240 peruser, while a 3Com Ethernet cost $3,339 per user.andP;  Finally, a 10Netpeer-to-peer network cost $3,008 per user.andM;Little cost difference apparently sprang from the topology choice.andP;  However,with high-performance servers such as the 3Com 3Server386 and OS/2 LANManager-based operating software, large networks begin to get fairlyexpensive.andM;Requirements must be thoroughly evaluated because the cost of fixing theoverload on an inappropriate network usually far exceeds the cost of doing itright the first time.andM;Also, the effectiveness of a particular topology in a small LAN may differgreatly from that in a larger, more stressed LAN.andM;When topology is selected, there usually is some choice of cable type.andO;Ethernet always requires coax; network speeds and length of runs will dictatewhether it must be thin or thick coax.andP;  In most cases thin coax isacceptable.andM;Coax requires special installation.andP;  It cannot be laid along the walls orleft to the elements.andP;  In many newer buildings, network cables can squeezeinto the conduits occupied by telephone cables.andP;  But the fairly large size ofcoax sometimes demands expensive separate conduits.andM;Star and Arcnet usually run on twisted-pair wire, often standard telephonecable that terminates in the familiar wall jack connectors.andP;  Telephonecabling is cheap to buy and usually cheap to install.andP;  It almost always canshare the building's phone conduits.andM;A Spare PairandM;Occasionally, a spare twisted pair on the in-house phone cable will servicethe network, simplifying installation and lowering cost.andP;  Sometimes thetwisted-pair cable must be shielded, but even so, it usually is cheaper thancoax.andM;The third cable alternative, glass fiber, costs more to purchase but often ischeaper to install.andP;  Only physical protection must be provided forfiber-optic cables; no shielding is needed against electrical noise oroutside security violations.andM;Fiber cable lengths can be quite long, often more than a kilometer, without arepeater.andP;  Because of its wide bandwidth, fiber-optic cable works for justabout any speed of LAN.andP;  Because it does not deteriorate like wire cable, afiber-optic installation probably will outlast the building where it is laid.andM;Internetworking to an AppleTalk network calls for special LocalTalk cablingto accommodate the AppleTalk interconnect.andP;  AppleTalk is much slower thanmost LANs to which it might interconnect.andP;  Fortunately, there are a number ofgood Ethernet cards for the Apple Macintosh.andM;Choice of a network hardware platform depends on whether the network needsworkstations or servers.andP;  In the server category, users have the choice of aconverted PC or a dedicated PC.andM;A converted PC, such as the 3Com 3Server, usually is an AT- or 80386-classmachine optimized for use as a network server.andP;  It may come with the networkoperating software and adapter card already installed.andM;The dedicated PC simply is an AT- or 386-class machine used as a server.andP;  Theuser installs the network adapter card, loads the server software and sets upthe fixed disk.andP;  In a peer-to-peer network like 10Net's, the server also maybe a workstation.andM;Workstations come in two types: PC and diskless.andP;  Diskless workstationsalready have their adapter cards installed for the desired topology.andM;PC workstations require installation of a card.andP;  If a Macintosh will become aworkstation on an MS-DOS network, the adapter card is just the first step tointerconnection.andP;  Because of differences between the Mac operating system andMS-DOS, some sort of internetworking software also is necessary.andM;The Cluster ApproachandM;Most of this discussion applies to a large single network.andP;  However, thereare times when a small cluster or subLAN is more appropriate.andM;The driving force behind such smaller installations often is the work group,or what used to be called departmental computing.andP;  However, the work groupdescriptor implies more.andP;  It is possible, for instance, for certainindividuals within an organization to belong to several work groups whilebeing employed within a single department.andM;The organization's department heads automatically belong to at least two workgroups: their individual departments plus the work group of all departmentheads.andM;Often the network needs to emulate such personnel situations.andP;  An easyapproach is to assign each department its own LAN cluster and tie theclusters together into a larger network of subLANs.andP;  One mechanism for thisis called the backbone network.andM;The backbone almost always is Ethernet, although in some large networks itmay be a broadband or T1 backbone instead.andP;  The various departmental clusterscan be Ethernet spurs off the backbone, resembling the nerves that branch outfrom the human spinal cord.andP;  Or they may be token-ring or star clustersconnected to the backbone by bridges.andM;Token-ring or star clusters have their own servers.andP;  The clusters function asindividual subLANs, each with a unique dedicated server, connected to thelarger system and thus to each other.andM;A cluster also can be a small peer-to-peer LAN if that is more appropriate tothe work group's needs.andP;  Again, the cluster must be bridged to the backbone.andO;If the subLAN consists of an Ethernet spur, it usually has its own separateserver.andM;In all cases, the designation of the subLAN's server is a function of thenetwork operating software, not of the network adapter card.andP;  But the typeand configuration of the subLAN strongly influence the choice of adaptercard.andM;A desktop publishing work group, for example, might want to use Macintosheson an MS-DOS network.andP;  Again, the best bet is to connect the Macs as anEthernet spur off the backbone.andP;  With internet software, the Mac users canaccess network data from their workstations and share the other desktoppublishing resources with their work group.andM;Macs also can run in an AppleTalk subLAN, although some would argue thatAppleTalk is not a LAN.andP;  The subLAN would be interconnected to the Ethernetbackbone through an appropriate bridge.andP;  Servers such as the 3Com 3Server386connect directly to AppleTalk networks.andM;Network size, as stated earlier, is a consideration in selecting the LANtopology.andP;  While many network cards sound as if they provide all the featuresof a particular topology, they actually are better suited to networks ofanother size.andM;Network DesignandM;Also important is network design, regardless of topology.andP;  Many experts claimthat a peer-to-peer LAN such as 10Net's is suitable only for a smallernetwork.andP;  However, some 10Net installations have several hundredworkstations.andP;  Large peer-to-peer installations display many small work groupclusters and an Ethernet or broadband backbone.andP;  In general, any networkshould be designed for maximum autonomy of work groups and maximumcommunication between groups when necessary.andP;  That almost always requiresinternetworking of differing topologies, which in turn almost always callsfor different adapter cards.andM;However, the good news is that most adapter cards are available for a widerange of protocols.andP;  The makers realize their products must be interconnectedon occasion, and provide compatibility and bridging capability.andM;A few cards, such as the PB-Link Arcnet from Packard Bell Electronics, limitsize to as few as 50 workstations.andP;  Most have much higher limits or no limitsat all.andP;  Bear in mind that the limit on the number of stations with a givennetwork card usually is based on tests under ideal conditions.andM;Real-world operations tend to impose stresses that effectively lower thenumber of stations.andP;  Even where a manufacturer specifies an upper limit of200 or more workstations per LAN, the limit may turn out to be half thatunder some conditions.andP;  In general, Ethernet cards make for the largest LANs.andM;When a company offers only one type of adapter card, it probably will beappropriate only for a small network, often a simple file or printer-sharingsystem.andP;  That does not imply lack of utility.andP;  Many user groups workautonomously and never expect to internetwork with any other group.andM;Their LANs should be selected for cost, efficiency within the work group andexpandability without internetworking.andP;  Small work groups tend to grow evenif they never need to communicate outside.andM;Special PlatformsandM;Connecting unusual or large platforms to a LAN raises special issues.andO;Examples range from Toshiba America Inc. laptops up to big equipment such asDigital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputers.andM;Toshiba laptops make space available for the addition of a network adaptercard.andP;  At least three vendors furnish such cards: Megahertz Corp. of SaltLake City, Pure Data Inc. in Carrollton, Texas, and Western Digital Corp. inIrvine, Calif.andM;The Megahertz offering is an Ethernet card.andP;  Pure Data supplies cards forboth Ethernet and Arcnet, and Western Digital's product is for a startopology.andM;Several vendors, not included in the accompanying chart, make Ethernet cardsfor the VAX.andP;  Bridging to the VAX also is an option if it runs UNIX.andM;One of the major applications of a LAN-to-VAX interconnect is for a databaseserver.andP;  A few database developers, such as Oracle Corp., put their databaseson the VAX for access by a PC.andM;A network can use the data as well if the LAN can interconnect to the VAX.andO;For maximum efficiency, the interconnect should be as direct as possible, viaan Ethernet direct link.andM;The final step, choosing an adapter card vendor, should start with theorganization's LAN-building preferences.andP;  Is it better to go with a singlevendor who provides the server hardware, the workstation cards and theoperating system software, or to build a custom system from individual ATs,boards and software?andM;Those who choose the turnkey approach favor Novell, 3Com and 10Net.andP;  Thesevendors generally offer a great deal of support with well-trained localdealers.andM;Those who plan to build a central server network themselves should start withthe best and most expandable AT or better machines they can afford, becausethe network probably will expand at intervals.andP;  Finally, the chosen cardvendor should provide not only desired topologies but also good localservice.andP;  A good product is not good enough if the nearest support is 2,000miles away.andM;No organization ever found configuring a new LAN easy.andP;  In fact, concern forsupport should be as great as for the products themselves in a first-timeinstallation.andM;Many network specialists say it is possible to mix one vendor's hardware withanother vendor's operating system in the same installation.andP;  These hardysouls have had a fair amount of experience at network configuration.andM;However, the inexperienced should avoid such practices until they have becomethoroughly familiar with both hardware and software from various suppliers.andM;Most adapter card manufacturers are eager to explain their offerings and,hype aside, prove very knowledgeable.andP;  As a final safeguard, an inexperiencedagency might do well to call in a consultant who has nothing to sell beyondthe consulting service.andM;What about adding to an inherited LAN that was not really well-designed inthe first place?andP;  Such an undertaking can be as much of a headache asstarting from scratch.andP;  The first thing to ponder is that the most immutableaspect is the software, not the hardware.andM;The agency probably has invested a huge amount in time, staff resources,applications, menus, shells and operating systems.andP;  In a large and growingnetwork, merely changing an operating system can bring the network down forweeks or longer.andM;The answer is to match new hardware as closely as possible to the old system.andO;For example, compatible cards probably will be available for an old Ethernetsystem.andM;If the preceding network designer adhered to standards, little difficultyshould arise.andP;  To add new clusters or subLANs, select an appropriateinterconnection to the existing LAN as if starting from scratch.andM;With a very poorly designed existing LAN, it might be a good idea to make allthe additions subLANs or clusters.andP;  That way, the old network can be replacedgradually with a proper configuration, one piece at a time, withoutdisrupting overall network operation.andM;Backup hardware is essential.andP;  LAN hardware fails more often than anysoftware.andP;  However, many failures result from poor configuration.andP;  Sometimeswrongly set configuration switches will show up as network failures when anew procedure or peripheral is tried for the first time.andM;One rule of thumb is not to allow failures to last longer than users canafford to spend catching up on lost work.andP;  If users have a fairly lightworkload, it may be possible to get away with a very few spare cards.andM;The best solution for hardware support is to contract with a reliablemaintenance service that is familiar with the network hardware and respondspromptly to needs.andM;Network adapter cards have advanced enough that users may well have to livewith today's choices for some time.andM;However, unlike hardware, LAN software evolves at a tremendous pace.andP;  No oneshould build a network without the capacity to handle the new generation ofnetwork operating systems and applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
