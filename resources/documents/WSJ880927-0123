An announcement by a company the size of Dow highlights recent efforts to keep plastics, as well as paper and metals, out of landfills that are nearing capacity. But whether the joint venture could become financially significant for Dow remains unclear.    Dow, based in Midland, Mich., said at a Washington news conference that the venture with Domtar would recycle polyethylene teraphthalate, used in soft drink bottles, and high density polyethylene, used in milk jugs and other rigid containers.    Dow would provide the recycling technology. Domtar, a Montreal-based company already involved in recycling paper, would provide the used plastic. They said their initial commercial plant could start operating in 1990 in a state yet to be chosen, after tests in a pilot program.    Plastics, though a relatively small portion of the materials entering landfills, have attracted attention partly because their recycling rate remains low. The Environmental Protection Agency says plastics make up about 7% of all solid waste in the U.S. Only about 1% of plastics are currently recycled. As a growing number of landfills reach their limits, more regulatory pressures are building to ban certain plastic products.    &quot;There are a lot of efforts by a lot of companies to get the monkey off their backs,&quot; said Sidney Rankin, a scientist at the Center for Plastics Recycling Research, an organization supported by industry and government at Rutgers University in New Jersey.    Many of the efforts focus on plastics in bottles, which are relatively easy to recycle. The bottles are essentially chopped up and washed, and then sold for use in such products as bathtubs, carpet backing and fiberfill for clothing and furnishings.    According to industry estimates, about 150 million pounds of plastic soft drink bottles were recycled in 1987, or perhaps one bottle in five. Wellman Inc., based in Clark, N.J., is dominant in this market, claiming about 100 million pounds a year for its plant in South Carolina.    Rutgers's Mr. Rankin cautioned that recycling capacity currently is more than enough to handle the bottles being made available, largely through state bottle laws. He added, though, that he expects bottle collections to increase.    Still, Dow said it is considering a plant with an annual recycling capacity of 50 million pounds. The company didn't estimate the cost, though it apparently will be small in comparison with Dow's resources. For example, the center at Rutgers has estimated that equipment costs of a plant with 10 million pounds of capacity, excluding the building and real estate, would total about $1.4 million.    Dow said it will bring to recycling an improved technology to produce higher-quality plastic. But the company didn't give specifics about the technology. </TEXT></DOC>
