The political appeal of the bid's 75% employee ownership -- which would make UAL the U.S.'s largest worker-owned company -- could counteract regulatory concerns about the bid's financing and the participation of a foreign entity.    Hoped-for cost savings of as much as $370 million in contract concessions from UAL employees, plus tax advantages available to employee stock ownership plans, also give the labor-management group a financial advantage. The concessions and tax advantages would provide the company with increased cash flow, enabling it to reduce debt more quickly.    The group, led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, proposed to acquire UAL for $300 a share, or $6.75 billion, in a leveraged buy-out. Mr. Davis has bid $275 a share, or $6.19 billion. UAL's board decided to study the latest offer.    &quot;I'm a little surprised the board didn't accept this, because I thought the board really wanted a management-employee LBO,&quot; said Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;I would say they still probably have the best chance.&quot;    On Thursday night, Mr. Davis telecopied a letter to the board saying that he might be able to top the $300-a-share proposal after reviewing confidential company data. He also said he might make a &quot;substantially higher&quot; bid if he could obtain significant labor concessions.    Even without the Davis letter, it would have been difficult for the board to approve the Wolf group's bid outright. The group still hasn't lined up financing, although a pilot union leader said several banks have expressed interest in financing the transaction.    Over the weekend, aides to Mr. Davis were negotiating terms with UAL advisers under which he would get access to company data and to members of top management. In exchange, he was prepared to agree not to make a hostile tender offer or seek to oust UAL directors as long as the company is sold to the highest bidder.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, UAL rose $7.25 a share to $287 as word of the buy-out proposal spread. Some traders say the bidding could top $325 a share, or $7.31 billion.    The debt-equity structure of the labor-management proposal mirrors that of the Davis bid. Both include about $1 billion in equity, with the remainder to be financed with debt.    In addition to the 75% stake for employees, the labor-management proposal includes a 15% stake for British Air and 10% for 35 UAL managers, including Mr. Wolf.    British Air is contributing $750 million in return for common and preferred stock. The pilots are investing $200 million from a pilot-directed pension plan to purchase a new class of preferred.    The pilots are also offering wage and work-rule concessions valued at $250 million annually, with as much as $120 million in annual concessions anticipated from other employees.    The contribution of UAL managers is more complex. As envisioned, the executives would acquire at least part of their stake by rolling over proceeds from existing stock options. The total dollar contribution of the managers couldn't be determined.    The terms under which the managers acquire their stake could prove a public-relations liability, depending on how lucrative the transaction is for them. But UAL managers also are expected to take pay cuts of as much as 10%.    Despite the employees' much bigger stake, they won't control the board initially. Management will get three seats, employees three and British Air one. In addition, there will be eight outside directors, whose selection method hasn't been determined yet. The pilots are also pressing for a labor-management governance committee.    The labor-management proposal marks a breakthrough in relations between Mr. Wolf and the pilot union, who have been at loggerheads for the last two years. In a statement announcing the proposal, Mr. Wolf singled out the Air Line Pilots Association for special praise. He said that because labor and management were able to team up in the bid, &quot;it will be the men and women of United who directly reap the benefits of their hard work and competitive success.&quot;    Mr. Wolf also said the employee offer won't include the sale of any assets.    The next round shapes up as a battle of wits between Mr. Davis, a billionaire known for shrewd buying and selling of assets, and the strong-willed and financially savvy Mr. Wolf.    Mr. Davis, who has bowed out of previous bidding wars when outpriced, may be able to recruit a foreign airline partner of his own. But any bid from him would still face two major obstacles. The UAL pilots have said they wouldn't give the same concessions to an outside bidder, and Mr. Davis must battle the board's natural sympathies toward management and employees.    Mr. Wolf must now try to rally all UAL employees to the plan. The initial response has been positive. The flight attendant union said it will explore participating.    The machinists union, which blocked a takeover attempt by the pilots in 1987, said it remains &quot;skeptical&quot; of the current Wolf proposal but might participate if the transaction can be structured to address its concerns about leverage and job security.    The machinists also questioned the amount of control the pilots would have and said they may seek to renegotiate many of the terms. The current proposal is &quot;just a Wolf in pilot's clothing,&quot; said Brian M. Freeman, the machinists' adviser.    Mr. Freeman said it could take a month or more of negotiations before the machinists make a decision.    The UAL board stopped just short of putting the company up for sale. It said it would explore both the Wolf and Davis offers &quot;and any other proposals that may be made, as well as other financial and strategic alternatives available to the company,&quot; with advice from First Boston Corp. and the law firm of Davis Polk andamp; Wardwell.    If the offer is accepted, Sir Colin Marshall, British Air's chief executive officer, would join UAL's board and Mr. Wolf would join British Air's. UAL may also acquire as much as 15% of British Airways' shares on the open market. Neither could acquire more than 15% of the other without regulatory approval. Both the U.S. and the United Kingdom bar foreigners from buying more than 25% of their airlines.    In a telephone interview from London, Sir Colin said the investment is part of British Air's &quot;global strategy&quot; to become a stronger competitor in the planned unified European Community market after 1992. For example, he said, British Air wants a link with United's planned flights from Europe to the U.S.    The British Air chief executive had said he didn't want to invest in U.S. airlines because of laws barring foreign investors from exercising control. But he said he changed his mind after UAL stock started moving on takeover speculation and first approached UAL in July, before the Davis bid.    Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation threatened to crack down on foreign stakes in U.S. carriers in the wake of KLM Royal Dutch Airways' $400 million investment in Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. But Sir Colin said the large employee ownership stake envisioned for UAL &quot;is likely to be quite appealing&quot; to U.S. regulators. &quot;The company will be quite clearly under the control&quot; of U.S. citizens, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
