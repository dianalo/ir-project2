Animal proteins may also eventually help make plants resistdisease or produce higher levels of useful substances, saidresearcher Andrew Hiatt.   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journalNature by Hiatt and colleagues at the Research Institute of ScrippsClinic in La Jolla, Calif.   Another scientist cautioned that ideas about potential uses areonly speculation.   The researchers made tobacco plants produce antibodies, a kindof protein best known for its role in the body's immune system.Antibodies latch on to specific germs as one step in fightingdisease.   The plants produced the antibodies because researchers had giventhem genetic material based on mouse genes.   Researchers experimented with a type of tobacco that is not usedfor smoking, Hiatt said. While it lends itself to laboratory work,other plants such as beans would be better suited for large-scaleproduction of antibodies, he said Wednesday in a telephoneinterview.   Antibodies bind to specific substances while ignoring others,which suggests that antibody-bearing plants might be able to trappollutants, Hiatt said.   For example, a large quantity of such plants might be harvestedand used for filtering river water that carries a low level of asuitable pollutant, he said.   Plant antibodies might also fend off plant diseases, make aplant produce higher levels of useful substances by altering itsbiochemistry, or serve as a relatively inexpensive source ofantibodies for medical use, he said.   But Peter Day, director of the Center for Agricultural MolecularBiology in New Brunswick, N.J., said relatively simple technologiesalready exist for filtering out pollutants.   He also noted that the antibodies had not yet been shown capableof fighting plant diseases by binding to microbes.   The Nature paper is ``quite an interesting piece of work,'' hesaid. ``It hasn't gone far enough to show exactly what thepotentials are, and what are the problems that remain to besolved.'''</TEXT></DOC>
