Speaking to reporters after giving a speech to anuclear-industry group here, Adm. Watkins broke his agency'sofficial silence on the offer, saying it was being considered&quot;very informally&quot; and with the approval of the StateDepartment. &quot;They {the Soviets} have a cash-flow problem andwe're sympathetic,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Nuclear-industry officials estimate that a deal betweenEnergy Department and the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energyand Industry could generate as much as $200 million a yearthat, under one version of the proposal, would be spent bythe Soviet Union on goods and services in the U.S.   In the past, the department has exercised a near-monopolyon uranium-enrichment services, which consists of increasingthe percentage of the unstable U-235 isotope that is found innatural uranium. But the Soviet Union, using more modernequipment, is able to sharply undercut the U.S. price forsuch services, in some cases charging about half of theEnergy Department price.   One result is that the department has begun losing some ofits major customers among U.S. utilities to the spot marketfor uranium-enrichment services, which is dominated by theSoviet marketing agency V/O Techsnabexport, part of theSoviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry.   Although some people in the industry said they expect theannouncement of a deal as early as next week's summit inWashington, Adm. Watkins said he is still studying thepolitical and economic aspects of such a trade. He pointedout that he wouldn't approve it if it turned out to be apolitical obstacle to efforts to develop more modern,privately run enrichment plants in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
