However, there is a much more serious implication in this rule. Consider: In all judicial proceedings every individual is required to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The Supreme Court ignored this fundamental requirement and barred a whole class of truth, that obtained by &quot;illegal means.&quot; Under this condition a trial becomes a charade, a game loaded in favor of the accused. Obviously the correct procedure is to admit the evidence, even if illegally obtained, and evaluate it for what it is worth. Then the offending officer should be prosecuted for his methods. Of course this would place an unwelcome burden on the relationship of the prosecutor to his friends the police. But that is what he is paid to do, like it or not.    P.G. Forsyth   Lake Worth, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
