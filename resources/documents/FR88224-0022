Telephone: (202) 732-3637.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Public Law 81-874, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 236 through 241-1 and 242 through244, commonly referred to as the Impact Aid maintenance and operationsassistance program, authorizes assistance for LEAs that are financiallyburdened due to a reduced local real property tax base resulting from Federalacquisition of real property, an increased student population associatedwith federally owned or leased real property, or both. Section 2 of theAct, 20 U.S.C. 237 (``section 2'') addresses the first type of burden byauthorizing payments to those LEAs that experience financial burdens dueto the Federal acquisition of a certain amount of real property since 1938.While these payments are intended to provide compensation to an LEA fora loss in local real property tax revenue resulting from the Federal acquisitionof certain real property within the school district, the program is basedupon the financial burden (if any) caused by that acquisition, and is notstrictly speaking a ``payment in lieu of taxes'' (PILOT) program.For an LEA to be eligible for section 2 assistance, the assessed valueof federally acquired real property, as of the time it was acquired, mustconstitute an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the assessed value ofall real property in the school district (including the Federal property).In addition, the Secretary must find that (1) the Federal acquisition ofreal property has placed a substantial and continuing financial burdenon the LEA, and (2) the LEA is not being substantially compensated fora loss in real property tax revenue by an increase in revenue resultingfrom Federal activity with respect to the Federal property.In order to provide information and guidance regarding the operation ofsection 2, the Secretary believes that it is desirable to describe in regulationshow the Department determines eligibility and entitlement for all LEAsapplying for section 2 assistance. The provisions of these final regulationsare based upon the eligibility and entitlement requirements in the Act.In addition to establishing a new Subpart J, which relates specificallyto section 2, existing regulatory provisions are amended as follows: InandSection; 222.3, a number of definitions are added, and others are revised;andSection; 222.20 is amended for clarity and to indicate that its provisionsapply to section 2; and technical amendments are proposed to andSection;andSection;222.17, 222.40, and 222.42. These regulations will have prospective effectonly, and will govern all subsequent payments for fiscal years beginningwith fiscal year (FY) 1988. In many instances, however, the regulationsmerely adopt current Departmental policies and procedures. <T3>See</T3> NPRM, 52 FR 16144 (May 1, 1987). Those current policies andprocedures will remain in effect during the interim period until the regulationsbecome effective, and thereafter in accordance with the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Information Contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>On May 1, 1987, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for the Impact Aid maintenance and operations assistance programin the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> 52 FR 16144-16155. Most of the explanatory statementsin the NPRM remain relevant. For the sake of brevity, those statementsare not being reprinted here.Readers are referred to the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 1, 1987 (52 FR 16144-16155). With fourexceptions, all information from the third column of page 16144 throughthe first full paragraph of the first column of page 16149 is pertinent.The first exception relates to the discussion regarding the general definitionof ``Federal property'' in the second full paragraph of the first columnon page 16145. The second and third sentences of that paragraph, whichwere incorrectly printed in the NPRM, should read: ``Second, off-base militaryfamily housing constructed under section 801 of Pub. L. 98-115 (10 U.S.C.2828), the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1984, generally willnot qualify as Federal property. While this property may be tax-exemptin some instances, the tax-exempt status generally will not be due to Federallaw, agreement, or policy.''The second exception relates to the discussion regarding andSection; 222.94in the third sentence of the first full paragraph of the middle columnon page 16147. As discussed in the response to comments on andSection; 222.94in the Appendix to these final regulations, language has been added tothe final regulations to clarify that original records of the assessedvalue of Federal property are required to establish eligibility only fornew section 2 applicants and newly acquired Federal property.The third exception, relating to the discussion concerning andSection; 222.99in the second sentence of the third full paragraph of the first columnon p. 16148, is addressed below under ``Significant Changes.''The fourth exception, relating to the discussion concerning andSection; 222.102in the third sentence of the last paragraph of the third column on page16148, also is addressed below under ``Significant Changes.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Significant Changes</ITAG>Significant changes in the final regulations from the NPRM are describedbelow. The NPRM noted that examples concerning Subpart J would not be shownin the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, those examples are notincluded in the final regulations. Except for minor editorial and technicalrevisions, deletion of the examples, and significant changes describedbelow, there are no other differences between the NPRM and these finalregulations.1. <T3>Section 222.91. </T3>Introductory language is added to clarify that,in addition to the definitions that apply only to the subpart, many ofthe general definitions contained in andSection; 222.3 apply to Subpart J.2. <T3>Section 222.94. </T3>Paragraph (c) states that the Secretary basesthe determination of eligibility regarding Federal acquisition of realproperty in a school district upon original records for new section 2 applicantsand newly acquired Federal property.3. <T3>Section 222.99. </T3>Paragraph (c)(1) no longer provides that, in selectingcomparable property, the Secretary will take into consideration the similarityof that property to the Federal property with respect to proximity to othertaxed real property that is more highly developed than the comparable property.While the Department believes that this provision is valid and would benefitLEAs, the provision is not being applied as a part of current policy. Thepreamble to the NPRM, however, did not indicate that this provision wouldbe a change from current policy. Therefore, although not required to doso as a matter of law, the Secretary is deleting the provision from thefinal regulations and republishing it as a part of the new NPRM (publishedin this issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>upon which further public comment is invited.Paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) describe methods used by the Secretaryto adjust the assessed value of selected property upward or downward inthe two most frequent circumstances in which no taxed real property withinthe same assessment district as the Federal property currently is substantiallysimilar to the Federal property as it was when acquired by the United States.4. <T3>Section 222.102. </T3>Paragraph (b)(1) no longer provides that an LEAformed by consolidation of school districts may establish eligibility undersection 2 on the basis of a former school district only if that formerschool district contained some section 2-eligible Federal property at thetime of the consolidation. While the Department believes that the provisionpublished in the NPRM has sound legal basis under the statute, it appearsthat former school districts currently are not required to contain anysection 2-eligible Federal property at the time of consolidation. The preambleto the NPRM did not indicate that this provision of paragraph (b)(1) inthe proposed regulations was a change from current policy. Therefore, althoughnot required to do so as a matter of law, the Secretary also is deletingthis provision from the final regulations and republishing it as a partof the new NPRM (published in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register) </T4>upon which further public comment is invited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, over one hundredand twenty parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysisof the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publicationof the NPRM is published as an Appendix to these final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order(EO) 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet thecriteria for major regulations established in that order.Several commenters believe that the proposed regulations should be classifiedas ``major'' regulations or rules under EO 12291. However, EO 12291 definesa ``major rule'' as: ``* * * any regulation that is likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) Significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.''These regulations do not fall within any of the above criteria. Althoughthe regulations may result in decreased entitlements to some LEAs, theydo not necessarily result in any increased costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Secretary has determined that these regulations will not have the typeof effect on a sufficient number of small entities that would require analysisunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act.A number of commenters expressed the belief that the regulations wouldhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The primary economic impact of these regulations relates to the section2 provisions, which affect approximately 270 LEAs. Available data for FY1986 indicate that only eleven of those LEAs that were small entities hadsection 2 entitlements comprising more than 5 percent of their total currentexpenditures for that fiscal year.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 222</ITAG>Education, Education of the handicapped, Elementary and secondary education,Federally affected areas, Grant program_education, Public housing, Reportsand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.

(b) The Secretary establishes an estimated current assessed value for Federalproperty as follows:(1) The Secretary determines whether there is taxed real property withinthe same assessment district as the Federal property that is currentlycomparable to the Federal property as it was when acquired by the UnitedStates. In making this determination, the Secretary_(i) Considers as comparable, and selects, taxed real property within thesame assessment district as the Federal property that currently is substantiallysimilar in classification, character, and condition to the Federal propertyas it was when acquired by the United States; and (ii) Does not consider all taxed real property within an assessment districtor assessment classification as comparable unless every parcel of thattaxed real property currently is substantially similar in classification,character, and condition to the Federal property as it was when acquiredby the United States. (2) If the Secretary determines that there is comparable taxed real propertywithin the same assessment district as the Federal property, the Secretaryestablishes an estimated current assessed value for the Federal propertyby_(i) Selecting a number of parcels of that comparable property;(ii) Computing the average current assessed value per assessment unit ofmeasure (<T3>e.g.,</T3> acre, square foot, linear foot, ect.) for the selected comparableproperty by dividing the total current assessed value of the parcels bythe total number of units in those parcels; and (iii) Multiplying the average current assessed value per unit for the selectedcomparable property computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section bythe number of those units in the Federal property. (3) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if the Secretary determinesthat there is no comparable taxed real property within the same assessmentdistrict as the Federal property, the Secretary establishes an estimatedcurrent assessed value for the Federal property as follows: (i) The Secretary selects a number of parcels of taxed real property withinthe same assessment district as the Federal property that currently arethe next most similar in classification, character, and condition to theFederal property as it was when acquired by the United States. (ii)(A) If the selected property differs from the Federal property as itwas when acquired, in that there are improvements on the selected propertybut there were none on the Federal property when it was acquired, and theselected property is assessed separately for land and improvements, theSecretary uses the assessed value for the land of the selected propertyin establishing the estimated current assessed value of the Federal property.(B) If the selected property differs from the Federal property as it waswhen acquired in that the selected property is of a higher or lower taxclassification (<T3>i.e., </T3>a tax classification that represents a greater or lesserdegree of development, respectively) than that of the Federal property,the Secretary maintains the ratio that existed at the time of Federal acquisitionbetween the total assessed value of real property in the same tax classificationas the Federal property and the total assessed value of all real propertyin the same tax classification as the selected property.

The Secretaryconsiders the unequalized portion to be the greater of_(1) The portion of the local real property tax rate for school purposesthat exceeds that part of the rate that an LEA must levy to qualify forState aid guarantees; or (2) The portion of the local real property tax rate for school purposesthat exceeds that part of the rate that will generate for the LEA an amountequal to the State aid guarantee.

A summary of other specific comments receivedon these regulations and the Secretary's responses follows. Major issuesare grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulationsreferenced in parentheses. Other substantive issues are discussed underthe section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and otherminor changes are not addressed. Effective date/non-retroactivity<T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters requested that the changes in policiescontained in these regulations not be made effective until fiscal year(FY) 1988 or 1989, and some commenters wanted implementation phased inover several fiscal years. One school district requested that the Departmentconsider a 7-year phase-in of the new rules to give school districts anopportunity to adjust their present millage at a gradual rate.Commenters objected to implementation for FY 1987, which they felt wouldbe retroactive because the final regulations were proposed to be publishedafter the beginning of school year 1986-87. Most of these commenters wereconcerned about the fiscal impact of earlier implementation; they statedthat school district budgets had been set for over a year, and that theyalready had committed funds that they anticipated receiving. A number ofschool districts indicated that they would not be able to replace lostrevenue through increased tax levies or other means unless implementationwas delayed or phased in. Many commenters were concerned that limited datawere available to them regarding the fiscal effects of the regulatory changeson their specific districts, and some requested public hearings prior toimplementation.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department's original intent was to make the newpolicies, other than those in Subpart J relating to section 2 of Pub. L.81-874, 20 U.S.C. 237 (``section 2''), effective starting with FY 1987.As indicated in a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 29, 1987, 52 FR 24181, the Departmentnow has decided not to implement these regulations until FY 1988. The changesare therefore not retroactive; they will have prospective effect only,and will govern all subsequent payments for fiscal years beginning withFY 1988. In many instances, however, these regulations merely adopt currentDepartmental policies and procedures. <T3>See </T3>NPRM, 52 FR 16144 (May 1, 1987). Those current policies andprocedures will remain in effect during the interim period before the regulationsbecome effective, and thereafter in accordance with the regulations. Any detrimental effects of the new section 2 provisions will not be experiencedby most school districts until FY 1989. Because entitlement computationsdepend upon an applicant's final fiscal data, which generally are not availableuntil after the end of the applicant's current fiscal year, FY 1988 paymentswill not be received by most school districts until the following fiscalyear (FY 1989). This normal lag in receipt of funds will allow school districtstime in which to adjust for any anticipated reduction in Federal fundsdue to changes made by the regulations. The effects of policy changes in these regulations on payments under section3 of Pub. L. 81-874, 20 U.S.C. 238 (``section 3'') are expected to be minimalfor the most part. Small numbers of children are usually associated withthe types of section 3 property that will become ineligible under the regulations.Generally, school districts have, or are able to obtain, data necessaryto analyze the effects of the changes made by these regulations. The Departmenthas responded, and will continue to respond, to specific requests for assistancein estimating the effects of the changes. In addition, Department officialshave participated in a number of meetings for school districts and otherinterested parties, in Washington, DC, and elsewhere, at which these regulationsand their effects have been a specific subject of discussion. The Secretary does not believe that public hearings are necessary, becausethe regulatory comment period provided for these regulations has allowedan adequate forum for the receipt of public opinion. The Department receivedwritten comments, many of which were lengthy, from over 120 parties. Thecomments were from a representative sample of Impact Aid applicants andinterested parties nationwide and covered many aspects of the proposedregulations.<T3>Changes: </T3>All provisions of the regulations will be implementedstarting with FY 1988. Extension of comment period<T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters requested that the Department extendthe 45-day comment period to allow for more thorough analysis of the proposedregulatory changes.<T3>Discussion: </T3>On June 12 and 29, 1987, the Department publishednotices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 22501 and 24181, respectively) extendingthe previously published 45-day comment period for an additional 30 days,to July 15, 1987. The Secretary believes that the resulting 75-day commentperiod provided interested parties sufficient opportunity to analyze andcomment on the proposed regulations. <T3>Changes: </T3>No additional extension of the comment period is beingmade.Hold harmless <T3>Comments: </T3>Three commenters requested that a ``hold harmless''provision be added to the regulations. One of those commenters believedthat school districts that had relied on Department guidance prior to theeffective date of the regulations should be held harmless. Another indicatedthat all school districts presently eligible and receiving Impact Aid fundsshould be held harmless. The third commenter requested that section 2 districtsbe held harmless at FY 1984 or 1985 levels until the fiscal impact of theregulations could be reasonably accommodated.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that a hold harmless provisionwith respect to these regulations is neither necessary nor appropriate.The most significant decrease in entitlements proposed by these regulationsrelates to section 2. The normal schedule for distribution of section 2funds will allow school districts time in which to adjust for any anticipatedreduction in Federal funds. In addition, providing a ``hold harmless''provision with respect to section 2 would continue to compensate schooldistricts doubly from Federal payments and State aid. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Regulations burdensome <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters indicated that the regulations imposean administrative burden on school districts by requiring them to determineproperty ownership and the source of the tax exemption for Federal property.One commenter stated that the regulations were unworkable because schooldistricts could not determine the basis of the tax exemption. Another indicatedthat the regulations would require a more costly data analysis and applicationprocess.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Impact Aid applicants have a fundamental responsibilityto establish the basis of their eligibility for funds under Pub. L. 81-874(``the Act''). The Department knows of no instance in which the currenttax status of real property is not readily available to an applicant schooldistrict from its local tax assessor's office. A number of school districtshave advised the Department that they already have been able to verifythis information.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Definitions (andSection; 222.3)<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believed that the portions of the generaldefinitions that relate mainly to section 2, <T3>i.e., </T3>paragraph 3 of the definition of ``Federal property'' andthe ``local real property tax'' definition, would more appropriately beplaced in Subpart J of the regulations until the Department publishes regulationsgoverning section 3(d)(2)(B) of Pub. L. 81-874, 20 U.S.C. 238(d)(2)(B).<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department believes that it would be confusingto applicants to repeat in Subpart J portions of the definition of ``Federalproperty'' contained in andSection; 222.3. Because the definition of ``localreal property tax for school purposes'' will apply to both sections 2 and3, including subsection 3(d)(2)(B), that definition is more appropriatelyplaced in andSection; 222.3.<T3>Changes: </T3>The Secretary has added language to andSection; 222.91to indicate that, in addition to the definitions in that section, manyof the definitions in andSection; 222.3 also apply to Subpart J.Definitions (andSection; 222.3_``Federal property,'' paragraph (1)(i))<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believed that Congress intended all realproperty described under section 403(1)(A) through (D) of Pub. L. 81-874,20 U.S.C. 244(1)(A) through (D) (Indian lands, property sold or transferred,low-rent housing, and Air Force flight training schools, respectively)be eligible, regardless of whether it is tax-exempt. The commenter feltthat those categories of real property are listed in the statute as specificexceptions to the general tax-exempt requirement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Act requires generally that, to be eligible as``Federal property,'' federally owned or leased real property must notbe subject to State or local taxation. The language of the Act is ambiguous,however, with respect to whether each specifically listed category of Federalproperty is subject to this general tax-exempt requirement. Therefore,it is necessary to refer to the legislative history of the Act (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>H. Rept. 2287, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (June 20, 1950);S. Rept. 2753, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (July 21, 1956); S. Rept. 91-634, 91stCong., 2d Sess. (January 21, 1970); and S. Rept. 95-856, 95th Cong., 2dSess. (May 15, 1978)), and to the general purpose of the Impact Aid program.In particular, the purpose of the Impact Aid program is to compensate schooldistricts for financial burdens imposed by the presence of tax-exempt Federalproperty and children associated with that property. Based upon both thelegislative history and the purpose of the program, the Department believesthat Congress intended the general tax-exempt requirement to apply to allcategories of Federal property, except Federal property described undersection 403(1)(B) of the Act, 20 U.S.C. 240(1)(B) (Federal property soldor transferred that remains eligible for one additional fiscal year).<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters opposed changing the definition of``Federal property'' to require that the tax-exempt status of that propertybe the result of Federal action, because they believed this interpretationis not supported by the statute or the legislative history. These commentersindicated that the regulations reduce payments, shift the responsibilityof funding from the Federal Government to a State or local government level,and are a complete departure from existing practices and policies. Onecommenter noted that the change inhibits the statutory purpose of compensatingfor a burden that exists if property is tax-exempt. Two commenters contendedthat the burden caused by Federal ownership of real property is not changedwhen the property is transferred to State and local ownership and remainstax-exempt, especially if the property is leased back to the Federal Governmentunder a long-term lease.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Congress enacted the Impact Act program to providecompensation if financial burdens are caused by Federal action. <T3>See</T3> section 1 of Pub. L. 81-874, 20 U.S.C. 236. If real propertyis tax-exempt due to State or local law, the real property tax base ofthe school district is not reduced because of any Federal action. The regulationsdo not shift financial responsibility, but rather eliminate Federal paymentsif State and local governments may tax real property but have not chosennot to do so.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comments: </T3>Five commenters specifically opposed excluding ``low-renthousing'' assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of1937 (``section 8 housing'') from ``Federal property'' status because theythought such an interpretation is not supported by the statute of the legislativehistory. One district stated that the regulatory change disqualifying low-renthousing property that is tax-exempt because of State or local action wouldnot result in any cost savings to the Federal Government because the fundssimply would be redistributed, and that the change was unnecessary to furtherany Federal purpose.Some commenters stated that all section 8 housing property should be eligibleunder the statute, and others indicated that only tax-exempt section 8housing should be eligible. These commenters believed that section 8 housingshould be eligible because of the specific statutory inclusion of low-renthousing projects assisted under the U.S. Housin</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
