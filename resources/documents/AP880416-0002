He said the five containers of nuclear waste arrived fordisposal as planned at Sweden's Studsvik plant but they were notproperly registered and were reported missing April 1.   The Atomic Energy Board traced the material through the WestGerman Environmental Ministry and the Transnuklear company thatorganized the transports, according to Ek.   He said a stronger control system, including customs reports onall nuclear waste shipments, will be implemented during the nextbudget year.   ``We will also demand that the nuclear plants and Studsvikinform us of transports within the country beforehand to make itpossible to estimate what security is needed,'' he added.   The new reporting system will enable the board to monitor thewaste transports step-by-step in the same way as shipments ofatomic fuel, Ek said.</TEXT></DOC>
