Eilperin said.   In his 27-page ruling, Eilperin gave Alabama authorities untilMay 1 to pick up the 17-year-old, identified only by the initialsO.M. But he issued an immediate stay of his order until Tuesday togive defense lawyers time to appeal his decision.   O.M. faces Alabama juvenile delinquency charges of arson andmurder in connection with a May 1988 firebombing of a Gadsden,Ala., apartment. In that incident, 14-month old Tamel Jackson waskilled.   Eilperin said the Constitution ``leaves no room for the Districtto interpose its objection to capital punishment between O.M. andAlabama.''   ``Alabama is entitled to have Alabama law govern criminal actscommitted on Alabama soil, by citizens of Alabama, against citizensof Alabama,'' Eliperin said.   Although not the key issue in this case, the age of thedefendant could become more of one in light of arguments in twocases heard Monday by the Supreme Court.   The high court is deliberating whether imposing the deathpenalty on murderers who committed their crimes before the age of18 represents ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the EighthAmendment to the Constitution.   A ruling is expected in July.   The boy's attorney, Gerald Fisher, argued at a hearing Tuesdaythat legislation pased by the district's City Council outlawing thedeath penalty must be applied by district courts to the interstateagreement governing juvenile extraditions.   But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the districtgovernment, said the district's obligation to enforce theinterstate agreement was not changed by the council's ban oncapital punishment.   Alper said the agreement does not give the district thediscretion to approve or reject juvenile extradition requests onthe basis of whether the juvenile might face the death penalty ifextradited.   Eilperin seemed reluctant during Tuesday's hearing to accept thecontention by O.M.'s lawyers that the district's ban on capitalpunishment would be violated if he approved Alabama's extraditionrequest.   He told Fisher a ``major problem'' with the argument was thatO.M. is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried as ajuvenile. And if Alabama decided to try him as an adult, Eilperinsaid, he would be obligated under the Constitution to approve theextradition, regardless of the ban on capital punishment.   But Fisher said Alabama authorities cannot certify O.M. fortrial as an adult, thus subjecting him to a possible deathsentence, unless he first is returned to the state. Extradition, heargued, would violate the district's death penalty ban because itwould enable Alabama authorities to try O.M. as an adult.   O.M. was arrested by district authorities in December and hasbeen fighting extradition ever since. His uncle, Yul Devoe Guice,31, was arrested by Alabama authorities soon after the bombing andcharged with murder and arson.   The boy's grandmother, Alice Guice Thomas, testified at ahearing last month that O.M., who is black, cannot get a fair trialfrom the white authorities of Etowah County, Ala., because thecounty's law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendettaagainst her family.   But Alper, arguing that the fairness of the Alabama judicialsystem was not at issue in the case, said district officials``would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabamaattempted to pass judgment on our system of justice.''   Alper also contended that a refusal by the district to enforcethe interstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this casewould quickly turn the nation's capital into ``a haven for fleeingfugitives.''</TEXT></DOC>
