Despite our high regard for the sponsor ofSection 201, we fear that it can only be described as an example of ``trialby legislature'' that transgresses the Constitution and represents unwisepublic policy. Since Section 201 also risk upsetting a judicially-approvedsettlement entered into by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), it raises serious questions about therelationship between the three branches of the Federal government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some of the provisions of Section 201, such as the requirement thatpurchasers be given certain ATV accident statistics, represent little morethan pointless, though relatively innocuous, Congressional micromanagement.Others, such as the requirement that a rule specifying performance standardsand design characteristics be promulgated within a year, may suffer thefate of all Congressionally-mandated unreasonable time requirements: thecourts end up rewriting the time deadlines. The expansion of the trainingprogram to all past purchasers is not justified by the record, which indicatesthat persons with a year's riding experience are already substantiallyout of any heightened danger. But the refund requirement represents unprecedentedlegislation that deserves a complete discussion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">atv safety and the settlement agreement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the extreme charges made against the safety of ATV's, weshould first consider the findings of a neutral group that systematicallystudied their characteristics: CPSC's ATV Task Force. While the ATV industrynever had an opportunity to rebut the findings of the Task Force, evena cursory reading of the Task Force Report reveals that there was no findingthat ATV's (with either three or four wheels) are even defective, let aloneunreasonably dangerous. The Task Force did not recommend <T3>any </T3>ban on ATV's, either three- or four-wheel models. The TaskForce did make some useful suggestions about how the risks from operatingATV's might be reduced. An Executive Summary of the Task Force's findingsand recommendations, prepared by the Task Force itself, is attached asAppendix A to these dissenting views. As discussed below, all of theserecommendations made their way into the Settlement Agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One other fact about ATV safety the ATV opponents prefer not to discussis that data developed by <T3> both </T3>industry <T3>and </T3>the CPSC shows that ATV's are <T3>not </T3>more dangerous than vehicles like trail bikes and snowmobiles,when the accident rate is adjusted to account for the hours of use thesevehicles receive. Unfortunately, two of the CPSC Commissioners chose notto look at such ``comparative risk'' data. While we agree that comparativerisk is not dispositive on the issue of whether or not to regulate a product,we find it puzzling that two Commissioners deliberately chose to ignoreit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite the fact that the ATV Task Force did not recommend eithera ban or a refund, the CPSC voted to ask the DOJ to pursue both remediesin December 1986. After studying the issues DOJ opened negotiations withthe five ATV manufacturers (and their distributors in the United Statesin the case of the four Japanese manufacturers). These negotiations ledto the filing of a Complaint, along with a proposed Preliminary ConsentDecree, on December 29, 1987. The Federal District Court for the Districtof Columbia (Honorable Gerhard Gesell, Presiding) approved the PreliminaryConsent Decree. After further negotiations, the parties agreed to a FinalConsent Decree and, after a public hearing in which numerous objectionswere raised to the Final Consent Decree, Judge Gesell approved the FinalConsent Decree and made it an Order of the Court on April 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In his Order approving the Final Consent Decree, Judge Gesell observedthat ``No decree designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far inmeeting such a massive national consumer problem.'' If anything, JudgeGesell's characterization represents an understatement. The text of theFinal Consent Decree itself is sixty-two pages long, and appendices addanother approximately eighty-nine pages. The major points of the FinalConsent Decree include:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (1) An immediate halt of all marketing, distribution, and sales ofthree-wheel ATV's and repurchase of all new, unsold three-wheel ATV's fromdealers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (2) Development of a nationwide free training program to all futureATV purchasers and all persons purchasing ATV's since December 30, 1986,including cash incentives to encourage users to take the training;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (3) A comprehensive campaign to warn ATV operators of the hazardsof ATV use, including a multimedia campaign, labels, notices, owners manualstatements, and posters;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (4) Development of advertising guidelines for future ATV marketing;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (5) Numerous reporting requirements to assist CPSC in monitoringcompliance with the Final Consent Decree;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (6) An agreement that CPSC and the industry would work together todevelop voluntary standards to govern ATV design and performance characteristics;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> (7) The government is explicitly given the right to reconsider whethera refund remedy should be pursued after December 31, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A two-page summary of the provisions of the Final Consent Decree isattached to these views as Appendix B. We agree wholeheartedly with thetestimony of Douglas W. Toms, former Administrator of the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration, before the Subcommittee on Commerce, ConsumerProtection, and Competitiveness: ``It [the settlement] represents an unprecedentedeffort to resolve a complicated an emotionally-laden safety problem throughnegotiations and reasoned compromise.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">defects of section 201</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">A. Upsetting the final consent decree</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In light of the comprehensive settlement agreement just described,Section 201 poses one enormous problem: It grants remedies that DOJ, ingood faith negotiations, agreed not to pursue and that a court, after fullreview of the agreement, including consideration of criticisms that thesettlement did not include the very remedies that Section 201 grants, approved.If Section 201 becomes law, how should the court deal with the inevitablemotion to modify or overturn the Final Consent Decree? If the Final ConsentDecree is overturned, what will be the effect on the existing program ofnotice, warning, and training? Will any party in future negotiations withthe government be able to rely on the government's agreement and not worrythat second-guessing Congressional action will change the rules of thegame if Congress finds the outcome not to its liking? For these and otherreasons, DOJ opposed the legislation in a letter dated May 25, 1988, fromActing Assistant Attorney General Thomas M. Boyd to Congressman WilliamE. Dannemeyer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 201 raises an additional difficulty because it requires CPSCto promulgate a number of rules setting forth the procedures and otheraspects of the refund remedy. It does not specify, however, what the scopeof judicial review of those rules will be. Section 11(c) of the existingConsumer Product Safety Act states: ``The consumer product safety ruleshall not be affirmed unless the Commission's findings under Section 9(f)(1)and 9(f)(3) are supported by substantial evidence on the record taken asa whole.'' Section 9(f)(1) requires the Commission to make findings concerningthe risk of injury, the number of products, the need for the product, andany means for achieving the objective while minimizing the disruption ofmanufacturing or other commercial practices. Section 9(f)(3) requires findingsthat the rule is reasonably necessary to eliminate unreasonable risk ofinjury and also requires a cost-benefit analysis. How should a reviewingcourt examine the procedures for refunds, when there has already been ajudicial, CPSC, and DOJ decision that refunds are not necessary? Judicialreview will be a hopeless muddle! Suppose the court decides that the recorddoes not support refunds and strikes down the procedures specified by CPSC?Section 201's failure to deal with the issue of judicial review opens thepossibility for many inconsistent determinations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">B. Constitutional infirmities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The refund portion of Section 201 is best characterized as an awardof damages by the Congress. Congress has decided that the the ATV manufacturerscommitted a tort in their marketing of ATV's and that past purchasers ofthree-wheel ATV's should be eligible for refunds. In making such a determination,however, Congress steps outside the bounds allocated to it by Article Oneof the Constitution and also transgresses other portions of the Constitution.Article One of the Constitution, with the important exception of impeachments,does not grant Congress the power to decide specific cases of controversies.Article Three grants that authority to the ``judicial Power of the UnitedStates.'' Judge Gesell exercised this ``judicial Power'' in approving theFinal Consent Decree. In addition, various plaintiffs are pursuing remedieslike refunds, in class action lawsuits against ATV manufacturers, beforeother representatives of the ``judicial Power'' of the United States. Ifthese claims have merit, an impartial judiciary, acting according to establishedprocedures and rules of evidence, can fashion appropriate relief. Congressneed not, and should not, undertake to try specific claims like this one.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other parts of the Constitution, requiring due process of law fordeprivation of property and equal protection of the law, indicate why Congressmay not, under our constitutional system, adjudicate specific claims. Thatthe ATV manufacturers will be deprived of property in this case is beyonddispute: refunds must be paid to any prior purchaser demanding one, andthe returned item, a three-wheel ATV, cannot be sold either within or outsidethe United States. Yet where was the due process of law that led to thatdeprivation of property? Was there an impartial trier of fact, subjectto appellate review, and obliged to try the claim according to establishedrules of procedure and evidence, including cross-examination of witnesses.No, none of these important guaranties of ``due process'' of law were presentin Congress's decision to award damages against ATV manufacturers. Similarly,has there been any attempt to punish others who may have ``mismarketed''other consumer products and possibly caused injury? No, the remedies ofSection 201 are aimed with the narrowness of a laser beam at five manufacturers,four of whom are large Japanese companies, a nation with which this countryhas a large, and politically embarrassing, trade deficit. It probably doesnot miss the mark by much to say that Section 201 is exactly the reasonthe Founding Fathers did <T3>not</T3> grant to Congress the power to try specific cases or controversies,save in the important and politically sensitive matter of impeachment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">C. Administrative difficulties </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another problem with Section 201 is that it will saddle the CPSC withthe enormous task of administering the refund program, with very littlelegislative guidance. Section 201 states only that CPSC shall promulgatea rule ``prescribing the procedure for the return of [three-wheel ATV's],''that the criteria for determining the value of the ATV shall consider theage, condition and other ``relevant factors'', and that the refund maybe in the form of a merchandise credit or cash payment, at the option ofthe returning purchaser. But how is the CPSC to set the value of a returnedATV? For that matter, what will be the value of a three-wheel ATV <T3>be, </T3>in light of the fact there will be no resale market? Shouldthe values be set high to encourage people to return ATV's? How will depreciation,damage, excessive use, and owner modifications adjust the refund amount?Where must ATV's be returned? How will the inevitable disputes that arisein such a program be arbitrated or adjudicated? What will the role of the500-person CPSC be in a program that has a potential involvement of oneand a half million three-wheel ATV's? Section 201 blithely leaves all thesedifficult questions in the hands of the CPSC, for future tortured resolution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">conclusion </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite our high regard for our colleagues who support Section 201,it remains unwise legislation, unsupported by the record, constitutionallysuspect, and administratively unworkable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74"/>APPENDIX A<ITAG tagnum="74">Report of the CPSC All-Terrain Vehicle </ITAG>(ATV) <T4>Task Force: Regulatory Options for All-Terrain Vehicles</T4><ITAG tagnum="89">executive summary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On April 3, 1985, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in responseto reports of numerous injuries and deaths associated with ATVs, establishedan ATV Task Force made up of Commission staff representing a broad rangeof technical disciplines. The Task Force was directed to carry out (1)technical analyses of ATVs, (2) monitor ATV industry activities to addresspotential hazards, (3) conduct public hearings on ATVs and (4) report tothe Commission by September 30, 1986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The major findings resulting from the ATV Task Force's work are listedbelow:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Typically, children under twelve (12) years of age are unable tooperate any size ATV safely. This is because they lack adequate physicalsize and strength, cognitive abilities, motor shills and perception.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Children under sixteen (16) years of age are at greater risk ofinjury and death than adults when operating adult-size ATVs. This is dueto poor judgment and failure to recognize and operate ATVs within theirskill levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The risk of injury declines significantly with ATV riding experience.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Thirty percent (30%) of all fatal ATV accidents were associatedwith alcohol use. Fourteen percent (14%) of all reported accidents withinjuries referenced alcohol consumption by the operator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Thirty-one percent (31%) of the ATVs involved in accidents werecarrying passengers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Well-constructed, well-fitted helmets could substantially reducethe number of fatal head injuries to ATV operators.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Seventy-four percent (74%) of three-wheeled ATV accidents involvedtipping or overturning compared to fifty-nine percent (59%) for four-wheeledATV accidents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. The dynamic stability of four-wheeled ATVs is better than thatof three-wheeled ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. The handling performance of an ATV is strongly influenced by itssuspension system; a properly turned mechanical suspension for front andrear wheels is better than front-only or tire-only suspended ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. The majority of state governments have no laws regulating theuse of ATVs. Where these laws do exist, they are not uniform from stateto state.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. The current draft industry voluntary standard is inadequate inaddressing the risks of injuries related to ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In repsonse to these findings, the ATV Task Force recommends the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Request the ATV industry to voluntarily cease marketing ATVs intendedfor use by children under the age of twelve (12). If unsuccessful, theCommission should then move to ban All-Terrain Vehicles from the marketplacethat are intended for use by children under the age of twelve (12).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a warning label standardfor the current ATVs intended for use by children under the age of fourteen(14). This standard would require labeling stating that these ATVs arenot recommended for use by children under twelve (12) because of theirlack of maturity and good judgment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a warning label standardfor adult-size ATVs. This standard would require labeling stating thatthese ATVs are not recommended for use by children under sixteen (16) becausethey are at a greater risk of injury and death than adults due to deficienciesin judgment and failure to recognize and operate within their skill levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a warning label standardfor ATVs. This standard would require labeling stating that ATVs have uniquehandling qualities and that ``hands-on'' training of the operator is necessaryto reduce the risk of injury and death.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Disseminate to the public the comparative safety information developedby the ATV Task Force. This information would describe the relative safetyamong ATV models.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Direct the Commission staff to carry out technical work necessaryto support issuance of one or more Notice(s) of Proposed Rulemaking toaddress the performance characteristics of adult-size ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Intervene in the development of the ATV voluntary standard by formallyrequesting that CPSC staff comments be incorporated into the first phaseof the voluntary standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Direct the Commission staff to fully participate in the developmentof performance requirements for the second phase of the voluntary standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. Direct the Commission staff to develop a strong information andeducation campaign in Fiscal Year 1987. The Iandamp;E campaign would focuson the facts that: children should only operate ATVs intended for themand not adult-size ATVs; ATV operator training is a necessity; ATVs areto be ridden by one person only; and wearing a helmet while riding an ATVsaves lives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. Direct the Commission staff to develop point-of-sale informationin cooperation with the ATV industry. Topics included in this informationwould be: minimum ATV operator age recommendations, the need for ATV operatortraining, the need to wear helmets while riding ATVs, the unique handlingqualities of ATVs, and the differences between risks associated with ATVsused for recreation and those for utility purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. Direct the Commission staff to work with the states and otherFederal agencies to encourage the development of practical, technicallysound and uniform state legislation and appropriate Federal regulationsfor operation of ATVs on public lands. Topics to be included are: minimumATV operator age recommendations, developing a licensing or certificationsystem to require hands-on training for ATV operators, helmet requirementsfor ATV operators, prohibitions against riding with passengers on ATVs,limiting ATV operation on paved roads, and prohibiting the use of alcoholand controlled substances while operating ATVs. Appropriate sanctions thatinclude but are not limited to fines, restriction for damages, loss ofoperator's license, impoundment of the vehicle, loss of vehicle registration,referral to perform a community service, and mandatory referral to andsuccessful completion of an alcohol/drug abuse safe-driving program shouldbe considered for inclusion in this legislation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74"/>ATV <T4>Final Consent Decree</T4><ITAG tagnum="21">The final consent decree is an agreement of the ATV manufacturersand the U.S. Department of Justice and Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC) approved by the U.S. District Court on April 28, 1988. It includesthe following major provisions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">three-wheeled atvs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New three-wheeled ATVs are no longer being sold by the manufacturers.The manufacturers are repurchasing any new three-wheeled ATVS from dealerstock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">age limits</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Minimum ages are established for operation of adult and youth sizeATVs. A minimum age of 12 applies to ATVs with engine displacement in the70-90 cc range. A minimum age of 16 applies to ATVs with engine displacementgreater than 90 cc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">training</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The manufacturers will provide free ``hands-on'' training for allfuture and past (after December 30, 1986) ATV purchasers and for membersof their immediate families who meet the minimum age recommendations forthe vehicle purchased. The training will be available to other interestedpersons on a fee basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To provide the training, the manufacturers have established the ATVSafety Institute, with administrative and educational resource personnelin the national headquarters, and with six regional offices, each witha full-time director. Each region will be staffed with part-time, localarea administrators, chief instructors, and instructors as needed to implementthe program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For persons who purchase a new ATV after April 28, 1988, there willbe an incentive payment ($50 cash or a $100 savings bond) if the purchaseror any family member completes the training course.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Training for persons under age 16 must be on appropriate size ATVs,in smaller classes, with exercises at slower speeds, and a parent mustprovide written consent and attend the class with the youth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">warning l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ab<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>els</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Four permanent warning labels will be placed<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on all new ATVs, including those in dealers' stock.The appropriate labels will also be mailed to all known ATV owners withinstructions for placing them on their vehicle. The four labels are asfollows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">General warning label</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This label, which warns of nine specific hazards in operating an ATV,will be located on the left front fender of each ATV.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Age warning label</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This label, with the appropriate minimum age for operating the vehicle,will be located on top of the fuel tank directly in front of the operator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Passenger warning label</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This label warns that a passenger should never be carried on an ATV.It will be located near the rear of the ATV, either on the seat or on thebody of the vehicle near the seat.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Tire inflation and overloading warning label</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This label will be located on the left rear fender. It warns againstoverloading the vehicle or using improper air pressure in the tires.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">other safety warnings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the labels, the consent decree requires the followingwarning messages:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The content of the general warning label will also appear on a hangtagon each ATV at the time of sale, and on the back outside cover of the ATVowner's manual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A safety video will be readily available in dealerships for viewingby actual and prospective ATV purchasers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A supplementary owner's manual with 26 specified ATV hazard warnings,each on a separate page, will be produced and mailed to all current ATVowners. New owner's manuals will contain the same 26 warnings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An ATV Safety Alert which contains extensive warnings, statisticsabout ATV-related injuries and fatalities, and information about the availabilityof safety training is being mailed to all known ATV owners and given toall new purchasers. The same message appears on large signs (approximately4' x 4') prominently displayed in each ATV dealership.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The manufacturers will maintain a toll-free safety hotline to answerconsumer inquires about ATV safety and training availability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The manufacturers will spend $8.5 million on an extensive ATV safetyawareness campaign employing television and print media in fall 1988 andspring 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">advertising guidelines</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All future promotional advertising for ATVs must conform to guidelinesspecified in the decree.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">standards for atv's</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The manufacturers have agreed to attempt in good faith to reach agreementon voluntary standards satisfactory to the CPSC within four months of theapproval of the consent decree.

We believe, however, thatH.R. 3343 will result in less, not more consumer protection. The changesth<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t H.R. 3343 makes to Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC) procedures and structures will make the CPSC less able to protectconsumers from dangerous products. Virtually all of the changes that H.R.3343 makes to present law will result in a highly-politicized Commissionunable to scientifically evaluate and systematically regulate the risksof consumer products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">title i</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">H.R. 3343 makes a number of changes to CPSC structure and proceduresthat will undermine its functioning. The wors<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> change occurs in the structure of the CPSC itself.Rather than having the Chairman appointed by the President, with the adviceand consent of the Senate, the bill requires that the Chairman be electedevery two years by the Commissioners themselves. The advocates of the billclaim that election of the Chairman by the Commissioners would ensure thatthe Chairman works closely with the other Commissioners. This argumentignores human nature: future Chairmen may well work more closely with theCommissioners who voted for them; their attitude will likely be quite differenttowards the Commissioners that opposed them. Such resentments will poisonthe work of a three-member Commission. The Commission will find itselfin the unhappy position of having just finished, yet about ready to begin,a campaign for the Chairmanship. In addition, H.R. 3343 specifically removesChairman Terrence Scanlon from his position and makes him ineligible torun again. This provision represents unseemly vindictiveness against aChairman who, as a sitting Commissioner with a well-established record,was appointed as Chairman by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other changes that Title I of H.R. 3343 makes to present law willhave the effect of preventing CPSC from systematically evaluating risksand deciding which ones to regulate based on an evaluation of the realthreat posed by those risks. Rather, CPSC will be forced to address risksthat have the greatest political ``clout,'' whether that clout is wieldedby Congress, by various consumer organizations, or by State attorney generals.For example, Section 102 of H.R. 3343 requires CPSC to respond within 120days to <T3>any </T3>petition filed by <T3>any </T3>``interested person'' to issue or amend a consumer productsafety rule. If CPSC denies the petition or if it fails to act, the petitionermay sue CPSC and a court will decide, without giving any deference to CPSC'sdecision, whether CPSC should commence a rulemaking procedure. Section102 does not require the court to take into account whether the risk isas serious as other risks or whether regulating the particular risk isa wise use of the resources available to the Commission. The Commissionwill find itself unable to decide on a systematic regulatory program basedon degrees of dangerousness; its entire program will be responding to petitionsand to court orders enforcing petitions. As if subjecting CPSC to petitionsby any ``interested person'' was not enough, Section 105 of H.R. 3343 independentlygives State attorney generals the same right.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several changes that H.R. 3343 makes to present law will be unnecessaryburdens to the business community but it will result in little or no improvementin consumer product safety. In 1981, Congress reformed the Consumer ProductSafety Act to eliminate the pernicious tactic of ``trial by press release.''Section 104 of H.R. 3343 restores that tactic by removing the requirementthat CPSC take reasonable steps to see that non-CPSC developed informationthat it propose to release is accurate, that disclosure is fair in thecircumstances, and that it is reasonably related to effectuating the purposeof the Consumer Product Safety Act. All that CPSC need do under the newsection is stamp such information with a meaningless disclaimer that CPSCis not responsible for the accuracy of the information. Yet it is preciselythe type of non-CPSC developed information that is likely to unfairly slandermanufacturers. Commission staff time spent reviewing such information priorto its release is time well spent, both to protect manufacturers againstunfair accusations, as well as ensuring that consumers are well-informedabout real, as opposed to media-created, product risks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">H.R. 3343 contains a potpourri of provisions that, while purportingto be pro-consumer, will actually hurt consumers by diverting CPSC stafftime from truly hazardous products. Section 106(b) requires notificationof every single product liability action brought in any court for ``seriousinjury'' (undefined) or death. How much CPSC staff time will be lost copingwith this blizzard of paper? Section 101(c) severely limits CPSC's abilityto rely on voluntary standards, by requiring that they be ``in existence''and that ``consumer organizations'' have participated in their development.How much CPSC time will be lost promulgating rules where voluntary standardswould have worked just as well? Section 106 states that <T3>any </T3>mislabelling of a product automatically results in a substantialproduct hazard. How many truly hazardous products will not be looked atbecause CPSC pursues meaningless labelling violations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sections 106 and 107 explicitly forbid CPSC from conducting any sortof cost-benefit analysis in making either substantial product hazard determinationsof in filing imminently hazardous product actions. Both of these sectionsmay result in waste: huge amounts of money spent to improve products resultingin only marginal gains in safety, while much more serious hazards go unaddressed.In addition, explicitly eliminating a cost-benefit analysis may be inconsistentwith other sections of the statute. Sect<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on 15(a)(2) of the existi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g Consumer Product Safety Act <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>equires CPSC to consider the ``pattern of defect,the number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severityof the risk, or otherwise . . .'' in making substantial product hazarddeterminations. In addition, Section 12(a) of the existing Act definesan imminently hazardous consumer product as ``a consumer product whichpresents imminent <T3>and unreasonable</T3> risk of death, serious illness, or severe personalinjury'' (emphasis supplied). The term ``unreasonable risk'' clearly impliesthat CPSC must balance the risk associated with the product with its benefitsand with the costs to improve its safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Title II</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Title II of H.R. 3343 furthers the process begun by Title I of removingfrom the CPSC the decisions on which risks to regu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ate and placing them in a political forum. TitleII contains directions for studies, for rules or for some other actionon the following specific products or activities: (1) all-ter<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ain vehicles (ATV's); (2) adult sleepwear; (3) lawndarts; (4) cigarette lighters; (5) amusement park operators; (6) fixed-siteamusement parks; (7) indoor air pollutants; (8) toy labelling; (9) children'sproducts; and (10) reclining chairs.

In the casesof fixed-site amusement parks and art materials labelling, the bill representedan authenitic compromise and the sections were useful. That leaves <T3>eight other</T3> subjects on which this Committee has directed CPSCto take some kind of action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to 1972, Congress enacted <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>roduct-specific legislation: poison prevention, hazardoussubstances, flammable fabrics, even old refrigerators. Congress formedCPSC, among other reasons, to ``protect the public against unreasonablerisks of injury associated with consumer products'' and to ``develop uniformsafety standards for consumer products'' (Sections 2(b)<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>(1) and (3) of the Act<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>) H.R. 3<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>3<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>43 turns back the clock and directs CPSC to takeaction on certain products, <T3>not</T3> because CPSC has determined that these products representany <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>articularly great threat, but rather because thereexists political pressure to ``do something'' about these products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We do not know whether the hazards posed by reclining chairs are greateror lesser than those posed by indoor air pollution or toys with small parts.There is little or no legislative record to guide us. In the absence ofa complete <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>egislative record that CPCS is <T3>not</T3> addressin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a hazard, we should not usurp CPSC's function andmicro-manage its activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Conclusion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">H.R. 3<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>3<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>43 represents a radical departure from what had beenCongressional policy, at least since 1972: that the risks posed by consumer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>roducts should be syst<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>matically studied and regu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ated by an expert Commission. H.R. 3343 shifts regu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>atory control from that expert Commission to thecourts or the Congress itself. As such, it represents a loss, not a victory,for consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">Carlos J.
