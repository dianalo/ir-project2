Macharski, Roman Catholic archbishop of Krakow, addressed severalthousand people representing various religions who marched more thana half mile from Birkenau along the railroad tracks used by theNazis to the former site of the camp's giant crematories, accordingto the state PAP news agency.   The procession was part of a World Day of Prayer for Peaceorganized by the church to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 1,1939, invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.   Marcharski spoke at a service at the international memorial tothe 4 million people put to death at the sprawlingAuschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex located in and aroundthe southern Polish city of Oswiecim. Among the victims were anestimated 2.5 million Jews.   ``Here the Nazi hatred killed millions of men, women andchildren: Jews destined for the final extermination which is todaycalled `Holocaust' and `Shoah;' Gypsies destined for extermination;despised Slavs, especially Russians and Poles, and many other sonsand daughters of nations mentioned on the tablets at which we arestanding,'' Macharski said.   PAP also quoted him as saying, ``In this terrible place, thecommitment against the evil that reigned here must be strengthened.No! To hostility and hatred towards Judaism. No! To any contempt andracial hatred. No! To the desire to rule and conquer, to contemptfor and struggle against religion.''   Macharski, whose archdiocese includes Oswiecim, has been acentral figure in the controversy over the convent of 14 Carmelitenuns in a building used by the Nazis as a storehouse just outsidethe fence of the Auschwitz camp.   Jews and some other religious leaders have said it is offensiveto have Christian symbols, including a tall wooden cross, at a placethat was the site of death for millions of people massacred solelyfor being Jews.   Poland's one rabbi refused to take part in Day of Prayer forPeace and only four Jews were listed as participating.   Macharski agreed in an accord in 1987 to move the convent to aninterfaith prayer center farther from the camp by Feb. 22, 1989. Buthe announced Aug. 10 that he was suspending the promise because of``aggressive'' protests staged at the convent by some Jewish groupsafter the deadline passed.   People in Oswiecim and elsewhere in predominantly Catholic Polandgenerally support the convent and its nuns, saying they harm no onewhen they pray for the camp's victims, thousands of whom were notJewish.   Oswiecim townspeople also distinguish between the Auschwitz camp,where many Polish political prisoners were slain, and the hugeBirkenau camp a mile away, designed for the mass murder of Jewsbrought by train from throughout Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
