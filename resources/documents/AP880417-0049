(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supporters of Jesse Jackson in Illinoisare warning Sen. Paul Simon that he could face a black voterbacklash two years from now, because his decision to suspend hisWhite House bid is seen as hurting Jackson.   By suspending his Democratic campaign rather than quittingoutright, Simon still stands to pick up 47 Illinois delegates whoare to be chosen next month by state party leaders.   Those delegates would otherwise have gone to Jackson. NowJackson supporters are making it clear they don't think Simon isplaying fair, and hinting he could face the consequences if heseeks Senate re-election in 1990.   ``Out is out. We want him out,'' said state Sen. Howard Brookinsof Chicago, Jackson's Illinois campaign chairman, in urging Simonto quit the presidential race.   Brookins joined other black leaders, including Chicag MayorEugene Sawyer, in urging Simon to formally end his campaign.   Illinois Republicans are already hinting that they see Simon'sliberal presidential platform as grist for the Senate campaignagainst him.   ``He's always been very successful in Illinois in hiding thefact that he's an old-fashioned 1950s liberal,'' said RepublicanGov. James R. Thompson.   ``That may have a more important bearing on the campaign for thesenatorship in 1990 than the fact that he missed some roll callswhile he was out running for president,'' Thompson said.   Some observers say attacks on two fronts _ from black Democratsand Republicans _ could hurt Simon's prospects for Senatere-election.   ``It depends on who runs against him, how he runs and what hedoes between now and then,'' said pollster Richard Day. ``It alsodepends on the mood of the state _ has it become slightly moreliberal, more conservative?''   Others predict the delegate controversy will be old news by then.   ``In this business, two years is a lifetime,'' added Chicagopolitical strategist William Daley, a son of the late Mayor RichardJ. Daley.   Illinois Democratic Chairman Vince Demuzio, a Simon supporter,pointedly compared Simon's delegation to the favorite-son unittaken to the 1984 Democratic convention by the late Chicago MayorHarold Washington.   Demuzio said of the delegate flap: ``It'll blow over.''   With Simon on vacation last week, his aides moved to quiet thegrumbling among Illinois' black Democrats.   The senator's press secretary, David Carle, said Simon's move tokeep a lock on the 47 delegates was intended to ensure a voice inAtlanta for his supporters, not to derail Jackson's candidacy.   In a letter to the Chicago Defender, a black-oriented newspaper,Carle suggested that were Simon to formally drop out of the race,many of his delegates might sign on with Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis, thus hurting Jackson.   Many Democrats say Simon's convincing win over Jackson inIllinois' March 15 presidential primary proves he's still popular.   ``He went a long way in stopping the rumors and the perceptionthat he was in trouble,'' Daley said.   But Jackson supporters point out the primary win was beforeSimon's controversial move to suspend campaigning and keep hisdelegates. They say any perception that Simon is linked to astop-Jackson movement could leave him without the support of manyof the blacks who helped lift him to victory in 1984.   ``They are raising this question with us, and we will have toanswer that as we move into elections, his re-election,'' Brookinssaid. ``I think that in the primary election there will be otherpeople running. There are many, many options.''   Simon's friends say attacks on him might actually strengthen hishand in a 1990 Senate race.   ``For many of us, Paul stands for a particular set ofprinciples,'' said state Sen. Dawn Clark Netsch of Chicago, a Simondelegate. ``I think people can be very proud, not so much of howfar he got but that he never wavered on the kind of things hestands for.''</TEXT></DOC>
