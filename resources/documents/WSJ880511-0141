I am very happy that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the World Wildlife Fund are helping to stop the illegal trade of souvenirs made from the body parts of endangered animals. Tourists need to realize that buying &quot;one-of-a-kind, exotic gifts&quot; for family and friends causes the needless suffering and deaths of endangered animals and encourages poachers to continue their despicable practices of killing.
