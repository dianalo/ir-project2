The F-15 jets, which are expected to arrive in the nextfew days along with tankers, Patriot air-defense missiles andother ground-support units, are intended to provide air cover-- and perhaps even escorts over Iraq -- for helicopters usedby United Nations inspection teams. The move also sends aclear military warning to Saddam Hussein.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bush and senior administration officials said anoffensive strike against Iraq isn't imminent. But if Baghdadcontinues to impede inspection of its remaining facilitiesfor chemical, biological and other weapons, Pentagon andother administration officials said, additional forces arelikely to be sent to the region, giving Mr. Bush the optionof ordering an attack.   Mr. Bush, while declaring that he was &quot;plenty fed up&quot; withSaddam Hussein's refusal to abide by the terms of theceasefire that ended the Persian Gulf War, went out of hisway to emphasize that he hasn't decided on offensive actionand expects the Iraqi leader will back down before there is amilitary confrontation. Asked about the likelihood of renewedfighting, Mr. Bush told reporters during a trip to the GrandCanyon: &quot;I don't think Saddam wants that. I'm confident hedoesn't.&quot;   In fact, some administration officials said the chances ofa strike have decreased slightly since last weekend, whenIraq began giving in to U.N. demands.   &quot;This whole thing is precautionary,&quot; White House NationalSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters travelingwith Mr. Bush. &quot;If he {Saddam Hussein} will comply with theU.N. resolutions, there won't need to be an execute order.&quot;   Mr. Bush last weekend authorized the Pentagon to prepareto move as many as 5,000 U.S. forces back to the Saudidesert. Some of the U.S. units slated to be sent to SaudiArabia won't arrive for some time under any circumstances,but the Pentagon's plans -- dubbed &quot;Operation DeterminedResolve&quot; -- give Mr. Bush great flexibility to adjust thespeed and size of the buildup depending on Baghdad'sreactions.   Administration officials didn't talk about the decision tosend forces back into the desert until yesterday, when NBCNews reported that U.S. combat power was headed to SaudiArabia. There currently are more than 36,000 U.S. forces inthe Persian Gulf region, including nearly 5,000 Air Forcepersonnel.   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Abdul Amiral-Anbari, dismissed the latest tensions as &quot;a tempest in ateacup,&quot; according to the Associated Press. He said Iraq hasbeen cooperating with the U.N., but trying at the same timeto protect its national security. Since the weekend, Iraq hassoftened its absolute refusal to permit U.N. helicopters tofly anywhere in the country and photograph suspectedweapons-making or research facilities.   U.S. officials said the international inspectors intend toignore any Iraqi conditions on helicopter flights that theyfind unacceptable, and that military action is likely only ifIraq tries to enforce all of its conditions.   In addition to the planes and crews already slated to goto Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon placed many more forces --including F-117 Stealth fighters, other frontline jet attacksquadrons and Apache helicopters -- on alert for potentialdeployment on short notice. The U.S. also has startedpreliminary discussions with some allies, including Saudileaders, about possible offensive action if Iraq continues toobstruct inspections.   The decision to send Patriot batteries reflects Saudi andU.S. concern that Iraq still has large numbers of operationalScud missiles, partly because it has been able to salvageparts from some missile launchers damaged during the war.Although top Saudi officials privately are every bit as eagerto get rid of Saddam Hussein as Mr. Bush, diplomatic sourcessaid, a resurgence of the religious right in the kingdom hasmade them ambivalent about serving as a launching pad for amajor attack.   Within the Bush administration, some officials long for anexcuse to strike again at Iraq -- perhaps even to attack theIraqi strongman himself. But officials yesterday cautionedthat the president and Mr. Scowcroft won't take such a stepwithout a clear provocation. &quot;What we're trying to do here isup the ante, . . . trying to force him to blink,&quot; said anadministration official.   If Mr. Bush opts for offensive action, it isn't clear whatthe prime targets would be. Presumably, the White House wouldbe intent on keeping civilian casualties as low as possible.But Pentagon planners and intelligence give the Iraqis highmarks for dismantling and hiding large portions of thesophisticated weapons-making equipment that survived the war.Much of it is believed to be in fortified bunkers nearpopulated areas.   Air Force Gen. Charles Horner, who would be in charge ofany aerial attack on Iraq, acknowledged to reporters earlierthis summer that it would take several days of sustainedbombardment to show significant results. But he cautioned,&quot;I'm not sure we really know&quot; the current location of themost important equipment.   U.S. officials are particularly concerned about Iraqideception involving its nuclear weapons program. Last month,a U.N. team found a factory 12 miles south of Baghdad thatwas manufacturing high-speed centrifuges used to producehighly enriched uranium. The factory's existence previouslywas unknown to Western intelligence agencies.   To avoid detection, the Iraqis also dismantled much of asecond nuclear-related plant, and covered what remained withsheets of styrofoam, dirt and a deep layer of gravel, theinspectors found.   In still another instance, Iraq took much of thesophisticated equipment out of a uranium-processing plant,and removed identification labels and serial numbersidentifying Western suppliers of remaining equipment. Theinspection team concluded that Iraq had substantial outsidehelp &quot;beyond the supply of equipment and materials,&quot; probablyincluding &quot;continuing technical advice.&quot;   ---   John J.
