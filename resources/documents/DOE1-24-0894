A putative radiomimeticmodel system, which uses H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ exposure at ice bath temperatures(0-9{sup 0}C), has been demonstrated to cause DNA strand breaks in cells.However, the spectrum of DNA base damage formed under these conditionshas not been chemically analyzed. Further, DNA exposed to H/sub 2/O/sub2/ has been used as a substrate in DNA repair enzymology studies, whilethe identity of the altered DNA bases is also not known. In this paperthe authors describe initial studies chemically characterizing DNA damagedby H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ in a cell-free aqueous system.</TEXT></DOC>
