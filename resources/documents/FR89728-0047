The PRSs are prepared annuallyin accordance with the Department of Energy (DOE) Order RA 6120.2. Thelast increase was based upon the FY 1982 PRS.The results of the FY 1987 PRS are being compared to a widely distributedFY 1986 PRS. The comparison shows the following differences:1. The projected operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) expenses for the 100-yearrepayment period have increased a total of $533 million.2. The projected replacements in the study period have increased $48 million.3. Other revenue, which is projected from other services provided by thepower system, is reduced in the study period by $103 million. Because ofrecent experience, we have projected higher firm power load factors, whichin turn reduced the surplus sales; and projected reduced transmission servicerevenues.4. Due to the above factors, repayment of the interest-bearing costs isnot as timely in the FY 1987 study as in the FY 1986 study, and the additionalinterest expense accrued over the study period is $373 million.Of the above factors, the one with the most impact is the matter of increasedOandamp;M expenses. Oandamp;M expenses are increasing due to inflation as wellas responses to programmatic requirements. Programmatic requirements haveresulted in increased personnel and equipment expenditures in such areasas: Computer support, financial system management, safety programs, conservationand renewable energy programs, and environmental concerns. Federal full-timeequivalency has remained essentially the same for the past several years.However, support services contracts have increased to accommodate additionalprogram requirements.In keeping with the project legislation, Western's policy for rate adjustmentsand DOE Order RA 6120.2, I am approving on an interim basis this requestfor a rate adjustment for the P-SMBP.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. James D.

Proceedings were initiatedon November 7, 1988, with publication of a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (53 FR 44945), which officially announcedthe proposed rate adjustment and procedures for public participation. Aseries of public information forums were held on December 7 through December9, 1988, in Northglenn, Colorado; Sioux City, Iowa; Fargo, North Dakota;and Billings, Montana. Two public comment forums were held January 10 and11, 1989, at Northglenn, Colorado, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The consultationand comment period extended through February 6, 1989.Various comments were received at the meetings and during the consultationand comment period. Three major issues and several miscellaneous issueswere raised. After reviewing and considering the comments received, andthe records of the meetings, this rate order was assembled to respond tothe comments offered during the public rate adjustment process. Westernhas concluded that the P-SMBP rate adjustment is needed to meet cost-recoverycriteria.Therefore, Rate Order No. WAPA-35, confirming and approving the P-SMBPrate adjustment on an interim basis, is hereby issued, and the new rateschedules will be promptly submitted to the FERC for confirmation and approvalon a final basis.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, June 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">W.

By Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effectiveDecember 14, 1983 (48 FR 55664, December 14, 1983, as amended), the Secretaryof Energy delegated: (1) To the Administrator of the Western Area PowerAdministration (Western), the authority on a nonexclusive basis to developpower and transmission rates; (2) to the Deputy Secretary, the authorityon a nonexclusive basis to confirm, approve, and place in effect on aninterim basis, power and transmission rates; and (3) to the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC), the authority on an exclusive basis to confirm,approve, and place in effect on a final basis, remand, or disapprove ratesdeveloped by the Administrator under the delegation.This rate order is issued pursuant to such delegations to the Administratorand the Deputy Secretary, and the Procedures for Public Participation inPower and Transmission Rate Adjustments and Extensions for the Alaska PowerAdministration, Southeastern Power Administration, Southwestern Power Administration,and Western at 10 CFR 903, published at 50 FR 37835 on September 18, 1985,with corrections published at 50 FR 48075, November 21, 1985.Effective DateThe new rates will become effective on the first day of the October 1989billing period and will be in effect pending the FERC's approval of themor substitute rates on a final basis, or until superseded.Description of RatesAlthough the P-SMBP is considered a single entity for financial and repaymentpurposes, the power generated by the P-SMBP is marketed in two separateand distinct areas. These are known as the Eastern Division and the WesternDivision, and each has its own marketing plan and method for collectingrevenues required from firm power sales.The proposed composite Eastern and Western Division wholesale firm powerrate for the P-SMBP will yield 8.32 mills/kWh versus the current 7.44 mills/kWh,which constitutes a 0.88 mills/kWh increase over the current wholesalefirm power rate.Eastern DivisionThe proposed firm power rate schedule for the Eastern Division only isexpected to yield a composite rate of 8.02 mills/kWh. Current Eastern Divisionrare schedules are designed to yield 7.14 mills/kWh.

Details of thisplan were published on January 31, 1986, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 51 FR 4012 and again on January 23, 1987,in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 52 FR 2597. A major feature of this plan wasthe integration for marketing purposes of the resources of the P-SMBP-WesternDivision with those of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project (Fry-Ark). In addition,a blended rate for P-SMBP-Western Division/Fry-Ark power will be established.Because of the blended rate, there will be no Loveland Area Office powerrate schedules specific to just the P-SMBP or the Fry-Ark; therefore, alldiscussion in this rate order concerning future Western Division revenuewill be expressed in terms of revenue requirements rather than the typicaldiscussion of ``mills/kWh.''Firm Power: Based upon the existing firm composite rate of 8.54 mills/kWh,and the projected energy sales of approximately 2,036 GWh used in the powerrepayment study (PRS), the Western Division's current yield from firm poweris $17,386,082. This is calculated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1>Current Yield:<ITAG tagnum="12">$0.00854 X 2,035,841,000 kWh=</ITAG><D>$17,386,082</D>Proposed increase:<ITAG tagnum="12">$0.00088 X 2,035,841,000 kWh=</ITAG><D>1,791,540</D><R>n,s</R>Proposed firm revenue requirement<D>19,177,622</D></ITAG>Peaking Power: Under the Post-1989 Marketing Criteria, excess capacitypreviously marketed as peaking power will be included as part of the firmpower sales, with an expected return of $1,425,600 per year.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1>$1.65/kW-month X 12 months X 72,000 kW=<D>\1\ $1,425,600</D><R>n,s</R>Proposed total revenue requirements<D>20,603,222</D><F>\1\ Western Division excess capacity marketed as peaking power in theFY 1987 PRS will be included as part of the firm power sales in futurepower repayment studies to be consistent with the Post-89 Marketing Criteria.</F></ITAG>The proposed rate of return for the P-SMBP-Western Division of $20,603,222per year will be recovered as part of the blended rate schedule being developedfor the Loveland Area Projects, which will include the annual revenue requirementsfor Fry-Ark. This rate schedule associated with the Post-1989 MarketingCriteria will be proposed to go into effect with the October 1989 billingperiod and will be the subject of a subsequent and separate formal rateadjustment procedure.Statement of Revenue and Related CostsThe rate adjustment would increase average annual firm power revenues forthe total P-SMBP by about $11.2 million. This is necessary to satisfy thecost-recover criteria as set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. A breakdownof costs by class of service is not available.

Revenues from other sources are estimated and entered into thestudy. The study adjusts this composite firm power rate until sufficientrevenues are generated to meet cost recovery criteria. The actual rateschedules designed to yield these revenues are determined by adjustingboth capacity and energy rates. The actual revenues collected for eachclass of service will vary from those estimated in the published FY 1987PRS as hydrological and market conditions change.Revenues from Western Division's transmission service rate are not shownseparately in the published FY 1987 PRS, but are included in the ``OtherRevenue'' column of that study.Explanation of Rate Development Process and Chronological Discussion ofthe Procedural History of the FilingProceedings on the proposed rate adjustment were initiated on September27, 1988, when a letter announcing preliminary informal customer meetingswas mailed to all firm power customers and other interested persons. Thesemeetings were conducted at four different locations on October 18 and 19,1988. At these preliminary meetings, Western representatives explainedthe need for the increase and answered questions from those attending.On November 7, 1988, a formal 90-day customer consultation and commentperiod was initiated with an announcement of the proposed rate adjustmentpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 44945. This notice also announced fourpublic information forums conducted December 7 through 9, 1988, and twopublic comment forums conducted January 10 and 11, 1989. The informationforums were further advertised with a November 25, 1988, press release.On November 18, 1988, a mailing of a final customer brochure was made toall customers and other interested persons. This mailing also includeda letter announcing the public information and comment forums. At the informationforums, Western representatives again explained the need for the rate increaseand answered questions. The comment forums were conducted to give the publican opportunity to comment for the record. Other comments were receivedthrough February 6, 1989, and have been considered in the preparation ofthis rate order.The notice of proposed power rate adjustment published at 53 FR 44945 onNovember 7, 1988, was for an initial composite Eastern and Western Division,P-SMBP wholesale firm power rate that would yield 8.51 mills/kWh or anincrease of 1.07 mills/kWh. Following the informal meetings, which wereheld on October 18 and 19, 1988, Western reviewed the study data, and foundprojections for Western Division generation had not been properly includedin the study. When these and other refinements were made, the final compositerate was reduced to 8.32 mills/kWh, which is the proposed increase of 0.88mills/kWh.Project History and General PRS DescriptionA complete discussion regarding the project history, and the general historyand description of the PRS, is found in the November 1988 customer brochure.Basis for Rate Development_Eastern DivisionThe Eastern Division firm power rate schedule will be increased so as toyield a net average return of approximately 8.02 mills/kWh. This is anincrease of 0.88 mills/kWh over the average return of 7.14 mills/kWh anticipatedfrom the sale of firm power under the P-SED-F2 rate schedule. The seasonalfirm power rate will be adjusted to be equal to the firm power rate.A customer's individual load characteristics determine the net revenueyield from the sale of power and energy to that customer under any rateschedule that incorporates both a demand and an energy charge. These characteristicsinclude load factor (the relationship between the energy use and peak demandfor any given time period), kW-months per year (the relationship of theoffpeak monthly demands to the annual peak demand), wheeling discounts(under certain circumstances a one mill/kWh discount will be granted ifthe United States is relieved of the cost of delivering power over a thirdparty transmission system), and voltage discounts (under certain circumstancesa discount of 5 percent of the gross power bill will be granted to thecustomers if the United States is relieved of the cost of transformingpower from one voltage to another). The composite of the individual customercharacteristics determines what the proposed P-SMBP Eastern Division rateschedule will yield in net revenue. For example, as load factor increases(energy requirements increase faster than capacity (or demand)), the perunit net yield (mills/kWh) from this type of rate design will decline.The opposite is also true. In addition, as the kW-months per year characteristicincreases, there is more revenue (demand charge), even though the overallkWh sales have not changed. If either of the discount characteristics (inlieu of wheeling and voltage) change, then the net yield under a rate scheduleis altered.Due to the comments received during our 1987 informal public meetings relatingto how system characteristics affect rate design, we have altered the waywe develop the characteristics. Instead of using a 5-year rolling averageof actual data, we have now projected what we estimate these characteristicswill be in about 2 years after this new rate goes into effect. This shouldprovide a rate design that reflects the system characteristics we anticipateduring the time the rate is actually in effect.Basis for Rate Development_Western DivisionThe rate schedules for the P-SMBP-Western Division are associated withthe Post-1989 Marketing Criteria, which are scheduled to go into effecton the first day of the October 1989 billing period, and will be the subjectof a subsequent and separate formal rate adjustment procedure.Discussion of Issues_Public CommentsMost of the comments received at the public meetings, and in correspondencethroughout the 90-day customer consultation and comment period, dealt withthe cost allocations of the Corps joint-use expenses for Oandamp;M, the overallincreases in projected Oandamp;M expenses, and the possible renegotiationof the contract with the State of Wyoming for repayment of the State'sinvestment in Buffalo Bill Dam.<T3>Issue.</T3> The changes in cost allocations of the Corps joint-useexpenses for Oandamp;M work.<T3>Response.</T3> The Corps has recently altered its method of assigningmultipurpose Oandamp;M expense to power for repayment purposes. This beganwith FY 1987 data when the Corps began using the ``current use'' methodof assigning these costs instead of the ``ultimate development'' percentagesused in the past. This was discussed in our public meetings. Western proposedthat the ``current use'' method be utilized for this adjustment. The customersare apparently in agreement with that proposal, but indicated that theissue be carefully reviewed prior to any future PRS. Meetings are now underwayto determine the validity of this change by the Corps.<T3>Issue.</T3> Projections of Oandamp;M expenses.<T3>Response.</T3> Prior to the formal public participation period, customersquestioned the magnitude of the Oandamp;M expenses utilized in the PRS. Accordingly,during the public information forums, Western presented a detailed analysisof the Oandamp;M expenses in one budget year for all three entities involved:Western, the Corps, and Reclamation. Also discussed were the methods usedto project Oandamp;M expenses for the outyears of the PRS. The customersindicated an appreciation for being allowed to examine these costs in detail,and a good general understanding of the budget process.As a result of this analysis, specific questions were raised about thenonrecurring replacement items included in the Western Division Oandamp;Mbudget as well as the assignment of direct and overhead costs among theprojects administered by the Western Division. The amounts shown as nonrecurringreplacement items in the Western Division Oandamp;M budget represent severalsmaller items that are not identified separately, but are combined anda portion of that total is included in Oandamp;M to assure repayment as anannual cost. The matter of the assignment of direct and overhead costsis a reclassification of certain administrative costs that previously wereincluded in the construction accounts, but now are properly shown as Oandamp;Mexpense.<T3>Issue.</T3> The possibility of renegotiating the contract terms onBuffalo Bill Dam modification with the State of Wyoming.<T3>Response.</T3> Western's Office of General Council is of the opinionthat the interest rate which applicable to the Buffalo Bill Dam modificationis established by statute. The contract in question is a three-party agreementamong Reclamation, Western, and the State of Wyoming. Informal contractwas made with the State of Wyoming to advise them as to the power customers'comments about pursuing the possibility of renegotiating the contract.It is possible that some mutually agreeable change in the contract, suchas a change in contract term, could address concerns expressed by the customersand also be beneficial to the State. Western will coordinate with Reclamationand the State to determine if either party has an interest in opening thecontract for discussion.Additional IssuesIn addition to the above, several issues were raised by customers and otherinterested persons, and addressed by Western. These issues were relatedto the following general categories:1. <T3>Status of Investment Repayment.</T3> A customer asked if the $721 millionrepaid so far out of the $1.6 billion of total power investment means thatthe dams are 45 percent repaid. Western explained that the $721 millionis the amount we have applied to repayment of the overall project investment,but that it would not necessarily mean that 45 percent of a particulardam has been repaid.2. <T3>Effects of the Bureau Reorganization.</T3> There were questions aboutwhether the recent Bureau reorganization, which consolidated three RegionalOffices into one office at Billings, was reflected in the study, sinceBureau costs seem to be going up. The answer is that the increased Bureaucosts shown in the study generally are for on-going construction; Oandamp;Mcosts (which include the effects of the consolidation) have not increasedsignificantly.3. <T3>Interest Rate Used.</T3> A customer asked if the interest rate in theFY 1987 PRS was the same as in the FY 1986 PRS. Western responded thatthe interest rate for future investments changed from 8.875 percent inthe 1986 study to 8.5 percent in the 1987 study.4. <T3>Review of Bureau and Corps Oandamp;M Costs.</T3> There was a questionwhether Western has an opportunity to determine the validity of the Bureauand Corps Oandamp;M expenses that are used in the study. Western repliedthe while we basically accept another agency's data, we reserve the rightto ask questions, and in fact, do frequently ask for explanations of majorchanges or of things in the data that we do not understand.5. <T3>Confusion About Replacement Investment.</T3> There was confusion abouttwo amounts given in relation to the replacement investment during thebudget period. Western understands how there could be confusion betweena $48 million and a $43 million amount that had been mentioned in the presentation.The $48 million amount is the total difference in replacements during thebudget periods on the separate FY 1986 and FY 1987 studies. While the restis budgeted in the Eastern Division, $43 million of the $48 million isbudgeted in the Western Division.6. <T3>Clarification of the Term ``Budget Year.''</T3> Someone asked for clarificationof what is meant by ``budget year.'' Western explained that in the contextof the discussion, the budget year was the first year of the 5-year budgetthat we were operating under for the time that the study was done.7. <T3>Firm and Nonfirm Sales as Related to ``Other Revenue.''</T3> Therewas a request to clarify how the relation between firm and nonfirm saleshas contributed to decreased ``other revenue'' projections. Western saidthat ``other revenue'' is composed of income from several items, such astransmission service revenues, etc., as well as from nonfirm sales. Specifically,however, there is only so much energy generation that can be produced inany one year by a hydrosystem; and customer load factors are graduallyincreasing. The higher load factors result in more of the available energybeing dedicated to supply firm contracts, leaving less energy for the nonfirmor surplus sales.A related question had to do with why the trend of increasing customerload factors did not cause an increase in the tip-up rate for those salesabove a 60-percent load factor. The answer was that as load factors goup, we are in effect selling more energy at the existing tip-up rate, whichprovides more income for those purchases we do have to make to supportthe above 60-percent load factor sales. 8. <T3>Factors Causing the Rate Increase. </T3>There was a request to summarizethe factors that were causing the rate increase. Western observed thatincreases in Oandamp;M costs coupled with decreases in ``other revenue''result in higher interest expenses (because the unpaid balance of investmentis higher than it otherwise would have been). Environmental Evaluation In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA),Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 through1508), and DOE Guidelines published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 15, 1987 (52 FR 47662), Western conductedan environmental evaluation of this proposed rate adjustment. Section D of the DOE Guidelines indicates that the level of documentationfor NEPA compliance is based in part on a comparison of the proposed rateadjustment and the rate of inflation since the last adjustment. Becausethis proposed adjustment is less than the rate of inflation since the lastrate adjustment, and because there does not seem to be serious customerobjection to this rate adjustment, Western has prepared a determinationmemorandum that concludes no further environmental analyses are required.Availability of Information All studies, comments, letters, memoranda, and other documents made orkept by Western for the purpose of developing the power rates are and willbe available for inspection and copying at the Billings Area Office, WesternArea Power Administration, 2525 4th Avenue North, Billings, Montana 59101,telephone: (406) 657-6532.Submission to FERCThe rates herein confirmed, approved, and placed in effect on an interimbasis, together with supporting documents, will be submitted to the FERCfor confirmation and approval on a final basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy, I hereby confirm and approve on an interimbasis, effective the first day of the October 1989 billing period, rateSchedules P-SED-F3 and P-SED-FP3.
