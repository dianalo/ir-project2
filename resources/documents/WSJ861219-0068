However, Benjamin L. Lubin, appointed by federal Judge Milton Pollack as part of First Jersey's settlement of Securities and Exchange Commission charges last year, added in his generally positive 91-page report that there has been a &quot;diminishing number&quot; of problems regarding First Jersey's ability to &quot;deal fairly with its customers&quot; since his first report last year.    New York-based First Jersey has been the subject of several federal proceedings examining its sales practices and the pricing of its offerings, which it categorizes as &quot;emerging growth companies.&quot; A pending SEC probe is examining whether some of the firm's 36 offices have in the past recommended that customers purchase the same stock that another office recommended selling at different prices.    Compared with a year ago, &quot;There's a definite improvement&quot; in its practices, Mr. Lubin, president of Securities Industry Management Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., said in an interview yesterday. Nonetheless, in his report Mr. Lubin said he still doesn't &quot;fully understand the methodology or the philosophy by which the management of First Jersey coordinates the activities of its marketing effort&quot; with the production of its research reports.    Specifically, Mr. Lubin said that greater disclosure should be made in the firm's research reports of the stock positions taken by First Jersey. He said First Jersey's frequently large &quot;short&quot; positions in stocks it is recommending &quot;is fundamentally inconsistent&quot; because the firm may profit by buying the stock at a lower price than it sold it for.    A First Jersey spokesman had no immediate comment on the investigator's report. A spokeswoman for the SEC, which is reviewing the consultant's report, also declined to comment.    Mr. Lubin's report was filed with Judge Pollack on Oct. 1, but hadn't been disclosed until the New York Times published an article about it yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
