Those are savings vehicles that used to be soldexclusively by brokers and insurance agents. Now a growingnumber of banks and thrift institutions are selling them,touting the ability of tax-free compounding to boost an 8%return to 13%, or even more.</LP><TEXT>   That can seem like a great deal, especially to someoneearning a feeble 5.5% or so in a passbook savings account.And, after all, it's your old trusty banker who's making thepitch.   But annuities sold in bank lobbies aren't any differentfrom those sold by brokers or insurance agents. Unlikecertificates of deposit, they aren't protected by federaldeposit insurance. Investors buying any annuity have to payattention to the financial soundness of the insurance companythat underwrites it. They also have to beware of terms andconditions that can lock them into low rates for years.   &quot;Don't let the location lull you,&quot; says Geoff Bobroff, asenior vice president at Lipper Analytical Services Inc. whotracks annuity performance. Investors should always check outthe merits of any annuity they consider buying, he says.   Annuities operate much like individual retirementaccounts. Investors fork over a lump sum (typically, $5,000or more) for a &quot;single-premium annuity,&quot; or pay ininstallments for a &quot;flexible-premium annuity.&quot; The money thengrows tax-deferred, until it is withdrawn at retirement. Atthat time, investors can choose to take the money in a lumpsum, roll it over into another annuity or an IRA, or havetheir money paid out to them in installments.   Over half of large banks and thrifts -- those with $750million in assets or more -- now offer annuities, and willsell approximately $9 billion in annuities this year, up from$7 billion in 1989, according to a survey by Kenneth KehrerAssociates of Princeton, N.J.   The banks' biggest selling point is convenience. Customerscan purchase an annuity as easily as they buy a CD. Somebanks, including New York's Citibank, count annuity balancestowards no-fee checking.   The annuities most commonly sold in banks and thrifts are&quot;fixed annuities,&quot; so-called because the interest rate isfixed for the first year or so. Thereafter it is guaranteednot to fall below a certain point, usually 3% to 5%.   Sales brochures for annuities offered by several New Yorkbanks all contain charts showing how an initial cash depositgrows to Mount Everest size over 20 or 30 years, given ahypothetical return of 8% and the magic of tax-freecompounding. A taxable investment, also shown on the charts,grows to only a molehill.   But investors have no assurance they'll actually get thathypothetical 8% a year. Instead, annuities guarantee aninitial interest rate for the first year or so. Thereafter,the rate investors get will be reset periodically, usuallyannually, depending on how successfully the insurer investedthe money and the percentage the insurer keeps for itself.   This makes it important for investors to ask the issuerabout the rates it has paid over the past several years, saysMr. Kehrer. Examining the three-year performance of bank-soldannuities, he finds that &quot;the company with the highestinitial rate doesn't have the highest three-yearperformance.&quot;   How do rates on bank-sold annuities compare with others?The average initial rate of the 30 annuities most frequentlysold by banks and thrifts is 8.41%. That's slightly lowerthan the average rate paid on annuities sold by brokers andslightly higher than the average paid on those sold byinsurance agents, says Mr. Kehrer.   &quot;Broker-sold annuities tend to have higher rates becausethey have lower commissions, or also because the portfolioscontain riskier, high-yield securities,&quot; he says. On theother hand, annuities sold by agents tend to pay lower ratesbecause the agents earn higher commissions, he says.Investors should also compare surrender penalties. Mostannuities impose surrender charges that typically start at 7%of the account balance during the first year, and then phaseout by 1% a year over the next six years.   Some annuities come with &quot;bail-out&quot; provisions that enableinvestors to withdraw their money without surrenderpenalties, if the annual interest rate is lowered below acertain preset minimum. Security Pacific, for example, givesinvestors the option to bail out if the renewal rate fallsmore than one percentage point below the initial rate.Annuities with bail-out provisions usually pay a quarter to athird of a percentage point less than others, says Mr.Kehrer.   Whatever the surrender penalty, annuity investors whowithdraw money before age 59 1/2 are subject to income taxeson the earnings that they take out plus a 10% federalpenalty.   Finally, before investing, investors should ask about thefinancial soundness of the insurance company that issues theannuity. Bank officials say that annuities they sell are fromhigh-quality issuers.   &quot;We do a rigorous amount of due diligence,&quot; says RayLuBien, executive vice president for marketing for SecurityPacific Insurance Group in San Diego. The bank insurancegroup looks at ratings by A.M. Best Co. and Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp., and hires third-party consultants to evaluateinsurers' portfolio quality, he says.   Some others say, however, that investors should be just ascautious with bank-sold annuities as they ought to be withannuities sold by brokers or insurance agents. &quot;What makesthem so smart that they can evaluate an insurer?&quot; saysLipper's Mr. Bobroff. &quot;I don't believe Merrill Lynch would doany more or less due diligence than Bank of America.&quot;   He suggests that investors are safer if they chooseannuities with interest rates that aren't out of line withthe market as a whole. &quot;If the rates are significantlyhigher,&quot; such as 10%, he says, &quot;the investor should be put onnotice,&quot; since the insurer may be making more riskyinvestments in an effort to achieve the hoped-for higherreturn.   ---    How Some Annuities Sold by Banks and Thrifts Compare                                                                                                                                                      PRESENT VALUE NAME OF BANK                  INTEREST RATE      OF $10,000    OR THRIFT     UNDERWRITER     GUARANTEED        INVESTED    (ANNUITY)      (RATING*)  FOR FIRST YEAR     3 YEARS AGO                                                                                                        Bank of America    Great            8.50%         $12,568 (GNA TD-76)       Northern                   Annuity                     (A)                                                                                                        Citibank          Nationwide        8.00            N.A.
