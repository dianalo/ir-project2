<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0755 </DOCNO><TEXT>A composite numerical simulation model developed from a series of MHDmodels was used to compute the solar-flare-generated disturbances ofphysical parameters, such as density, temperature, velocity, and magneticfield from the solar surface (i.e., the photospheric level) to the earth'senvironment. It is shown that the disturbed earth's environment at highlatitudes can be approximated by starting with the knowledge of the occurrenceand the strength of a solar flare, then simulating the evolutionary consequencesof the solar disturbance through interplanetary space up to and throughthe magnetosphere. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
