The book says that in the past 12 months, a Chinese missileknown as the CSS-2, with a range of about 930 miles, has been soldto Middle East countries which also have Soviet technology.   Reports also surfaced that those countries are negotiating toacquire the more advanced ``M family'' of Chinese missiles, thebook says.   ``In some instances, missile acquisitions are combined with aprobable capability to provide nuclear warheads and once thishappens, the whole thrust of denuclearization (within) the existingnuclear powers is blunted,'' the editors said.   They said short-range ballistic missiles are being developed orare owned by at least 16 countries outside NATO and the WarsawPact, including Argentina, Brazil, India, Egypt, North Korea, SouthYemen and Taiwan.   They said it is not clear whether any of the missiles beingdeveloped or sold outside the big five nuclear powers _ the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ are beingarmed with nuclear warheads.   They noted, however, the last report by the International AtomicEnergy Agency suggested that a further eight countries have thecapability to manufacture nuclear warheads: Argentina, Colombia,India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, South Africa and Vietnam.   The book says there also is a further proliferation ofstationing ballistic and cruise missiles on ships and submarines.   ``The dangers and vulnerabilities are obvious: previously safedeployments of ships to trouble spots around the world could in thefuture be threatened by such forces in the hands of smallernations,'' the editors wrote.   ``With the improved accuracies and lethality of someconventional warheads, all nations should be aware of the changingthreat.''   Lennox and Loasby predict that space will be used in any futureconfrontation not only between the superpowers but also smallernations.   ``The scope for intelligence-gathering, monitoring of events,navigation, meteorological data-gathering, global communicationsand, perhaps, the eventual positioning of defensive and offensiveweapons in space, makes it essential for any nation planning todefend itself to be involved in military space research,'' theywrote.</TEXT></DOC>
