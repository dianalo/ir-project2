In the Senate's case, the problem is a 30-year-old subway systemthat links two of the three Senate office buildings to the Capitol.   The senators complain the subway trains just don't move oftenenough and fast enough to get them to the Senate chambers forroll-call votes.   Now, a Senate committee has asked the Capitol architect to comeup with a full report on the costs of modernizing the subwaysystem. An early estimate of the price tag: $10 million.   The Senate made its first stab at making legislating a moreorderly affair in February, when it put itself on a new workschedule.   One of the changes was to limit roll-call votes _ whichsometimes took an hour or more while the Senate waited for anabsent member to arrive _ to a strict 15 minutes each, noexceptions.   Shortly after the new rules were enacted, several memberscomplained that they had arrived at the station at the Hart OfficeBuilding _ some four blocks from the Capitol _ with a minute or twoto spare to make a roll call, but the subway car was jammed withvisitors. They had to wait for the car to return _ a round triptakes about five minutes _ and they missed the vote.   Half of the 100 senators have offices in the Hart building.   After complaints were made, new rules were issued for thesubway: No one but senators can ride during roll-call votes.   The Senate Rules and Administration Committee also called onCapitol Architect George White to study the subway system and seeka long-term solution to the problems facing senators coming fromthe Dirksen and Hart office buildings. The Russell Office Buildinghas its own line with two sets of tracks.   White recommended to the committee last week that the Senatereplace the current two-train shuttle system with a new system offour small trains following one another at one-minute intervalsover what he described as a ``pinched loop.''   The vehicles would stop at each station in Dirksen and Hart. Thecurrent system has one car on the track to Dirksen and one on thetrack to Hart, returning on the same line.   White said the new system could be completed in about 30 monthsand would provide ``a greatly improved, frequent, fast andconvenient service to and from the Capitol.''   White rejected another proposal for a moving sidewalk which hesaid would not be fast enough to handle the Senate's needs.   After White estimated the cost of the new subway at $10 million,Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah asked: ``Now what do you estimate the realcost to be?''   White replied that his estimate was conservative.   Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., then asked White if he thought thecost would be more than $10 million. White replied that he thoughtit would be less.   Garn wasn't convinced.   ``Having been here 14 years, I have yet to see anything thatdidn't cost more than we originally estimated,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
