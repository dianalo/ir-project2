GENERALE D'ELECTRICITE, the recently denationalized French communications and energy group, said it is in advanced talks with state-owned THOMSON S.A. to acquire its copper-wire activities, and is also set to sell its glass-making unit to an Italian group.    Pierre Suard, chairman, said both moves are part of CGE's strategy of reinforcing its position in core activities while shedding peripheral units that don't have the critical size to survive.    Separately, Mr. Suard announced that the group would be listed Sept. 29 on seven European stock markets in four countries. CGE is already traded in London.    Mr. Suard wouldn't give a price for CGE's acquisition of Thomson Cuivre, a unit of Thomson, which should be completed soon. Mr. Suard also said CGE is expected to announce soon the sale of its Ceraver unit, which makes glass insulators, to Societa Fidenza Vetraria, an Italian glass-making group that is owned by the holding company Participazioni Finanzarie e Industriali. A price wasn't given for the transaction.    CGE officials yesterday confirmed predictions that the company would post sales this year of about 130 billion French francs ($21.7 billion) and profit of about 2.1% of sales. </TEXT></DOC>
