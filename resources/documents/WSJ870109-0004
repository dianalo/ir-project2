The accord ends two weeks of jockeying between Stamford, Conn.-based Combustion and Hercules Inc. of Wilmington, Del. for control of AccuRay, a Columbus, Ohio-based maker of industrial process-control systems.    On Dec. 30 Combustion raised its tender offer for AccuRay by $10, to $45 a share, topping a $40-a-share bid by Hercules that had been approved by AccuRay the day before.    On Monday Hercules, a chemical and aerospace concern, dropped its tender offer for AccuRay. Yesterday AccuRay said it paid Hercules $8 million in connection with the termination of their earlier agreement. As part of the termination pact, Hercules agreed not to buy any AccuRay shares before March 7, AccuRay said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, AccuRay closed at $44.75 a share, unchanged.    Combustion Engineering, an industrial technology company, said its tender offer is scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Jan. 15. The industrial process-control systems field has captured the interest of many companies recently, because its products, computers and other technology, designed to boost factory productivity, are in growing demand by the nation's hard-hit industrial sector. </TEXT></DOC>
