The white-collar corruption probes that started with DennisLevine in 1986, led to Ivan Boesky and targeted Michael Milkenyielded their first criminal conviction Wednesday with the guiltyverdict against 26-year-old Lisa Jones.   Less than 30 minutes later in the same courthouse, a federaljudge declared another mistrial in the GAF Corp. stock manipulationcase after the jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days ofdeliberations.   The outcome of the two trials left defense lawyers unimpressedwith the government's trumpeted efforts to bring Wall Streetcriminal charges to court.   In the Jones case, attorneys said, the government may haveoverzealously pursued a defendant who was by all accounts a minorfigure in the alleged scandal. And with GAF, the government wasunable to convince a jury of its case.   ``In a day where you have all this Wall Street bashing, a jurywas unable to decide after two weeks, and that means to me theydidn't have what evidence goes with a criminal case _ harm,malevolence, evil intent,'' securities fraud lawyer Stanley S. Arkinsaid.   Until now, cases derived from the insider trading scandals of themid-1980s were settled through government plea bargains or as civilclaims by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   At least half a dozen criminal trials are scheduled for laterthis year. They will test the confessions of Boesky, thenow-imprisoned arbitrager, and other financial figures who havecooperated with the government in exchange for leniency.   Prosecutors based much of the GAF case, which ended in a Januarymistrial after the government unintentionally withheld evidence, ontestimony by Los Angeles broker and admitted felon Boyd L.Jefferies. He said GAF asked him to illegally manipulate the priceof Union Carbide Corp. stock.   Many attorneys expected the trial to turn simply on whetherjurors believed Jefferies. But during deliberations, the panel askedfor charts and graphs and re-heard testimony involving theoften-confusing intricacies of stock trading.   The GAF case also was seen as problematic because none of theaccused made any money from the alleged deals.   ``What it proves is the jury element is an important distinctionbetween civil and criminal cases,'' said Paul Fischer, a former SEClawyer now in private practice. ``You just never know about a jury _whether they'll understand the case, what they'll focus on in makinga decision.''   Said Arkin: ``I think whenever they try cases where nobody gothurt and they are hypertechnical cases, (prosecutors) ought torethink it.''   Under former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, the governmentbrought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases starting in1983 and made fraud prosecution a priority, increasing thecomplement of investigators to about 20. A handful of earlier,insider trading-related cases did go to trial, including the 1986conviction of former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans,but GAF was the headline case spun off from Boesky.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said after the verdict the governmentintends to bring the case again and attributed the second mistrialto the vagaries of juries.   Some defense lawyers agreed.   ``I don't think that means either the government can or can't winan insider trading case. It means that in this case nobody won sofar,'' said Michael Feldberg, a prosecutor under Giuliani from1981-84.   The GAF jury, which was sequestered March 10, issued a statementthrough U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe saying it would notcomment on deliberations.   In the Lisa Jones trial, defense lawyers harshly criticized thegovernment's tactics, accusing prosecutors of badgering her,misleading the jury and raising red herrings about stock deals thatJones may not have understood.   Jones was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice forlying to a federal grand jury in 1987 during an investigation ofpossibly illegal stock purchases by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. fornow-defunct Princeton-Newport Securities LP.   Jones worked for Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel trader whofaces a June trial on racketeering charges along with fivePrinceton-Newport partners. Newberg reported directly to Milken, whois expected to be indicted for fraud and racketeering.   Lawyers portrayed the prosecution of Jones, a one-time runawaywho rose to a $117,000-a-year position at Drexel, as overzealous.They claim she was treated harshly on the stand _ she broke downrepeatedly _ as a message to potential future witnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
