The scandal strikes an electronic church which has already beenmeasurably diminished by last year's controversies over JimBakker's adultery and high living and Oral Roberts' claim that Godmight ``take me home'' if he failed to raise $8 million by the endof March.   ``My feeling is that there will be more damage, and thecredibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt alittle bit more. How much, I don't know,'' said Jerry Rose,president of National Religious Broadcasters.   Rose, of WCFC-TV in Chicago, noted that Swaggart had been avigorous proponent of the NRB's efforts to improve financialaccountability, as well as an emphatic preacher about sexualmorality.   ``A lot of people saw Jimmy as a pacesetter for doing whatneeded to done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,''Rose said.   As Bakker resigned in shame a year ago, Swaggart thundered:``God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails done,fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel.''   Even before Swaggart's recent problems, the name-calling amongthese men of God and the jokes of late-night comedians had movedPat Robertson, now a Republican presidential contender, to say thathe resented being identified as a ``television evangelist.''   Swaggart _ by some measures, the biggest of them all _ steppeddown from his pulpit Sunday after confessing that he had sinnedagainst God and his family. He didn't explain, but others reportedthat the Louisiana evangelist had been photographed entering amotel room with a prostitute.   ``We're the last surviving ministry, the last one,'' the Rev.Jerry Falwell told students at his Liberty University in Lynchburg,Va., on Sunday. ``Bakker is gone. Robertson is gone ... running forpresident. Swaggart is now gone. We're the last. The credibilitycrisis is unbelievable.''   With that crisis came hard times for the television ministry.Falwell, Swaggart and Roberts all have lost part of their audience,and Robertson laid off nearly 500 employees at his ChristianBroadcasting Network last summer and 145 more in November.   CBN's contribution income dropped by 32.5 percent from April toOctober, said Benton Miller, the ministry's director ofcommunications. Not only did the PTL scandal hurt, Miller said, butfalling oil prices cut into the income of some supporters and thestock market dived in October.   ``There was a real drought for a good bit of last year,'' saidFalwell's spokesman, Mark deMoss, who predicted Monday that theremay be little or no impact this time.   ``Part of that is due to the way Jimmy Swaggart has handled hisadmission of wrongdoing,'' deMoss said. ``I think another reasonfor that is, thanks in great part to the media, the general publicnow has a better understanding of the difference between acharismatic and non-charismatic ministry and now is able to tellthe difference from one ministry to another.   ``I look at the example of a Gary Hart moral failure _ that didnot ruin the Democratic party or other Democratic candidates, butit did ruin Gary Hart,'' deMoss said.   Falwell, Moral Majority's founder, is an independent Baptist anda fundamentalist. Charismatics may share his Biblical literalism,but they emphasize ``gifts of the spirit'' such as speaking intongues and healing.   Bakker and Swaggart were both ordained by the Assemblies of God,a charismatic denomination.   Swaggart had a larger audience, 1,720,000 households per weeklast November, than any other video evangelist, according to theArbitron rating service. The A.C. Nielsen Co. put Swaggart'saudience at 860,000 households, second to Robert Schuller's1,189,000, but Nielsen said Swaggart was seen on the most stations,286.   Arbitron reported that Swaggart's audience had been 2,161,000households in February of last year, before the PTL and OralRoberts controversies. Between February and November last year,Arbitron said, Schuller's audience dropped from 1.7 millionhouseholds to 1.4 million, Roberts from 1.15 million to 900,000,and Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' from 616,000 to 495,000.   Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programsreach additional viewers on cable television.   The negative publicity started last year when Roberts, who hadbuilt an evangelistic empire including a university and a hospitalin Tulsa, Okla., announced that God might ``call me home'' if hedid not raise $8 million by the end of March.   Bakker resigned March 19, 1987, after admitting a sexualencounter with a young woman later identified as Jessica Hahn.Bakker said he had asked Falwell to take over, but later claimedthat Falwell had stolen PTL.   Bakker and his top aide, the Rev. Richard Dortch, weresubsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God.   The story popped up through the year. The Bakkers feuded withFalwell, who finally resigned in frustration in October. JessicaHahn turned up in the pages of Playboy, and in the mansion of HughHefner.   In December, the Internal Revenue Service claimed that theBakkers had been paid $9.36 million in excessive compensationbetween 1981 and 1987.   This month, PTL's new trustee, David Clark, filed suit againstthe Bakkers and former aide David Taggart, seeking $52.8 millionfor mismanagement and unjustified compensation.   Bakker's 81-year-old parents, Raleigh and Furnia Bakker, werelaid off last week from their $500-a-month jobs as greeters at theHeritage USA resort, where they have continued to live.   This month, members of the National Religious Broadcastersadopted a financial code of ethics which will require publicdisclosure of annual, independent audits of all income andexpenditures, except for salaries.</TEXT></DOC>
