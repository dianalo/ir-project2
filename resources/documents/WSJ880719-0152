This is how Sergei Mironenko did it: He painted &quot;The first free candidate for president of the U.S.S.R.&quot; in big black letters on a white background, and beneath that stuck six grinning photographs of himself wearing a medal. At the bottom of the election-campaign-style picture, the bearded Moscow artist added in red letters: &quot;The swine. What have they turned the country into?&quot;    A few years ago in the Soviet Union, anything that challenged Communist Party rule with such cheek would probably have landed its artist in jail or worse -- if anyone had dared paint it at all. Today, Mr. Mironenko's work hangs in a show of Soviet contemporary art in one of Moscow's most prestigious galleries, stopping astonished visitors in their tracks.    Among other pictures exhibited is one by Mr. Mironenko's twin brother, Vladimir, that makes fun of the official Soviet dislike of abstract art, and a drawing by Dmitri Prigov of a drooling monster clasping the word &quot;glasnost&quot; to its hairy chest.    The art show, which ran into trouble with local authorities, could only open thanks to the good timing of its organizers and the unwitting assistance of the British auction house, Sotheby's. But it shows just how far some artists are able to go in testing the limits of new-found freedoms under Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost, or openness, and perestroika, the restructuring of Soviet society.    Standing in his paint-spattered studio, the 28-year-old Mr. Mironenko talks about the Gorbachev reforms and says: &quot;I'm not for perestroika, I'm much further than perestroika.&quot; He is working on a picture of a parquet floor made from the epaulets worn by KGB officers.    &quot;The moral revolution has occurred,&quot; contends Yegor Yakovlev, editor of the reformist weekly Moscow News. &quot;Fear, docility, demagogy, life with your eyes shut in a cat-and-mouse game -- people have started to discard all this.&quot;    Soviet artists started noticing the changes about 18 months ago. Until then, the official style was &quot;socialist realism,&quot; with its cloying depictions of muscular, heroic workers joyfully building socialism. Anything else risked being bulldozed, as literally happened to one impromptu art show in the 1970s.    Gradually, underground artists started heeding the talk of greater openness and grew bolder -- just as journalists, historians and filmmakers were doing. In their tiny studios or apartments, they took the wraps off abstract and political works until then shown only to other artists or occasional foreign collectors.    Both within the official union of artists and outside it, groups with names like Champions of the World or Kindergarten started holding exhibitions. The authorities, who still have final say over what can be shown, grew uneasy but learned to relax their grip.    Less than two years ago, Mr. Prigov, one of the most energetic activist artists, was dragged off a street by the KGB and held for two days for setting up an informal art group. A few months ago, he managed without difficulty to stage a &quot;happening&quot; at the local public baths, where artists, wrapped toga-style in towels, held forth like orators in ancient Rome.    Champions of the World exhibited a picture called &quot;Moscow-Health Spa&quot; that shows palm trees growing out of the Kremlin and a beach behind it. An official of the Young Communist League, which provided rooms for the show, complained that the work &quot;didn't show proper respect for the hero city of Moscow.&quot; But it stayed up.    The successes encouraged Mr. Mironenko. For years he, his brother and a handful of other artists have worked in an informal avant-garde group called Toadstool, also known as Home for the Blind, after the organization with which they share a telephone.    He painted his Mironenko for President picture three months ago, and his timing couldn't have been better. The exhibition at the Kuznetsky Most gallery was due to open only days after a Communist Party conference that resoundingly endorsed Mr. Gorbachev's policies of openness. As it turned out, the Soviet leader outlined reforms at the conference that included having himself elected president -- adding poignancy to Mr. Mironenko's picture.    The artists hung the pictures on a Tuesday, hoping to open the show on Wednesday. Officials from the Moscow city culture department and the artists' union took one look and balked.    They said Mr. Mironenko's picture and two other works had to go: one of Mr. Prigov's drawings, which satirized the celebrated Russian general, Kutuzov, and a chair by Lenya Purygin inviting anyone to sit in it and view his nightmare-like pictures -- unless they happened to be from the culture department.    But the artists refused to remove the offending works, threatening instead to close the show. Their ultimatum put the Soviet authorities in a quandry:   On the one hand, the works clearly stepped beyond the bounds of what was acceptable. &quot;They said it was a political provocation that had nothing to do with art,&quot; recalls Mr. Prigov.    On the other hand, Sotheby's was holding a much-touted auction of Soviet contemporary painting in Moscow the next day, and international art collectors with fancy names and fat wallets were flocking to the city. The Ministry of Culture didn't want to spoil its image as an enlightened patron of the arts, especially as some works at the auction were by artists also showing at Kuznetsky Most.    At a stormy one-hour meeting in the artists' union headquarters the following day, the authorities backed down, the exhibition was allowed to go on, Mironenko and all. It may not be socialist realism, but it was glasnost.    The artists celebrated by taking a drunken cruise on the Moscow River and planning their next daredevil moves.    &quot;This could never have happened two or three years ago,&quot; chortled Mr. Prigov, vodka dribbling through his fingers from a leaky paper cup. &quot;They didn't want a scandal, and we had the stronger nerves.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
