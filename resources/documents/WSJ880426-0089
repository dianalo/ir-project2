Like a platoon of real-life but unsullied Gordon Gekkos, they argue that they make everyone rich and business more efficient.    True, there can be big money in the right portfolio of &quot;deal stocks.&quot; Allegis has gained some $2 billion in value because of the breakup forced by Coniston Group. Some say Texaco might be worth $3 billion less if investor Carl Icahn hadn't pushed it to settle with Pennzoil. And much of the market's sizzle this year has come as stocks like Federated Department Stores and Roper doubled or better.    Now, however, some Wall Street investors, looking at market volatility, are becoming less sanguine about deal stocks and appear less willing to pay high prices for the more speculative ones. Instead, the savvy professional manager who creates wealth over the years is regaining favor among some investors over the raider who hopes to unlock it through quick financial maneuvers.    At the same time, a new wave of unwanted assaults is prompting critics to revive their familiar argument that raiders can actually diminish wealth -- by causing upheaval or by forcing companies to take on huge debt in an uncertain economy. And, in the current takeover frenzy, raiders are being overshadowed by managers making strategic acquisitions.    In terms of consistent wealth creation, some Wall Street professionals come down firmly on the side of managers, not raiders. &quot;There's just no contest,&quot; says Laszlo Birinyi, a Salomon Inc. market analyst who tracks investment returns.    In recent years, Mr. Birinyi says, blue-chip stocks like Ford have contributed two to three times as much to the broad market's gains as stocks involved in takeovers and leveraged buy-outs. That's because deal stocks, though big news, are really only a small part of the total investment picture.    William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc., a New York money-management firm, believes increased market volatility may reduce enthusiasm for trading in &quot;take-out&quot; stocks. His big winners have been long-term holdings in stocks like General Mills and Genentech. Predicts one arbitrager: &quot;A couple of deals will hurt people, and there will be a cooling in the {deal} market.&quot;    After gaining a big following in the bull market, raider stocks took more catastrophic losses in the crash than most shares, putting some traders out of business. A residue of skittishness remains.    Some raider stocks already reflect it. Last Friday, the value of TWA stock shot up $214 million when Mr. Icahn, TWA's chairman, revived an offer to take the company private. But some traders say it might have gone higher if he hadn't pulled such a bid once before, hurting them.    MCA, which spiked up in February after New York developer Donald Trump said he might buy a big stake, now is several points lower. &quot;There seems to be greater confidence in moves by corporate managers than by some raiders,&quot; says Linda Newman, president of Atalanta Capital Corp., a New York money manager who trades deal stocks actively.    Data compiled by Salomon show that in the first quarter, a typical fund indexed to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index would have made 33% of its gain in market value from blue chips and only 15% from announced and completed deals. That measure is important, because maybe 25% of pension funds that buy stocks are indexed to the Sandamp;P; many more buy similar stocks.    &quot;There's a general feeling that raiders are good, but the balance sheet is very uncertain for me,&quot; says Warren Law, a Harvard Business School professor and director of several companies, who has been a critic of raiders. &quot;A corporation is more than its stock,&quot; and shouldn't necessarily be sold or broken up because of a temporarily depressed stock price, he says.    The issue is more than academic, as raiders are currently out in force. There's the battle at Gillette, where Coniston, which as a money manager is a kind of black-tie raider, campaigned for board seats on a platform of selling the company. (The outcome of last week's vote is still unknown.) There's Texaco, which Mr. Icahn, recently joined by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the leveraged buy-out concern, appears to want sold. The Haft family, which has forced buy-outs before, is after F.W. Woolworth. Oil men Cyril Wagner and Jack Brown are mounting a renewed battle for control of USG Corp. And T. Boone Pickens Jr. has recently been tilting at Texas Air, among others.    &quot;As long as these people believe there's a way to make money, they're going to invite themselves into the action,&quot; says Arthur Fleischer, a takeover lawyer at the New York firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson.    Traditionally, though, investors betting on good corporate managers haven't done badly. Conservative investor Warren Buffett, though trading in some takeovers recently, used to call insurance executive John Byrne his &quot;meal ticket.&quot; Mr. Byrne, now chairman of Fireman's Fund, turned around a faltering auto insurer, Geico, taking the stock from $2 a share in 1976 to the high $70s in 1985.    Even raiders admire some corporate types. &quot;The good manager is the real folk hero and builder,&quot; remarks Coniston's Paul Tierney, citing the enormous wealth created by technology entrepreneurs like William Gates of Microsoft Corp.    However, there are far more lesser-known wealth creators who slog it out each day. Walter Raab, chairman of AMP Inc., isn't considered glamorous, but has won respect for steering his Harrisburg, Pa., electronics company through a bad industry slump. He has spent heavily for new products and customer service and managed to restore pretax profit margins to 25%.    &quot;We've always taken a long-term look, even during hard times,&quot; Mr. Raab says. Without a raider in sight, AMP's stock almost quintupled in the five-year bull market to $71.50 a share, while the average stock was tripling. Before the market crash, AMP stockholders had almost $4 billion in 1987 paper profits. Even post-crash, they're about $1.3 billion richer than on Jan. 1, 1987.    Hard times and foreign competition, not raiders, have forced many companies to rethink strategies and overhaul operations, says Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital Corp., a money manager. Caterpillar Inc. lost a bundle in the early 1980s when Third World natural-resource projects petered out. Though it closed plants and laid off workers, it also invested heavily in new lines of equipment. So when the dollar weakened and business turned, Caterpillar was ready. Its profit doubled in 1987. Its stock went from $40 to almost $75 precrash and now trades at around $63.    By comparison, concerns run by some of those most critical of other managers don't show up nearly so well. Robert Holmes a Court's Australian resource empire has fallen prey to other raiders. Dividends from Mr. Pickens's Mesa Limited Partnership may put money in shareholders' pockets, but Mesa needs loans or profits from its stock-market plays to help sustain the current payout. (&quot;Hell, what does it matter where the money comes from?&quot; Mr. Pickens says.)    And Mr. Icahn's TWA, with long-term liabilities nine times greater than common equity, &quot;may find it difficult to carry such a heavy debt load&quot; in the event of industry setbacks, says Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon. Reflecting that view, a recent $300 million issue of unregistered TWA debt carries a 17 3/4% coupon.    Mr. Icahn is often at the forefront in arguing the case for hard-nosed shareholder tactics. Because of bad managers, he says, &quot;our productive machinery is sputtering.&quot; He asks, &quot;How many companies would restructure if they weren't worried about being called to the carpet?&quot;    It isn't always clear, however, who is creating how much wealth. Alfred Kingsley, Mr. Icahn's top lieutenant, says Mr. Icahn's actions since 1980 have added almost $10 billion to the economy. That includes about $2.5 billion of gains in USX shares since Mr. Icahn bought a big stake in 1986 and proposed a restructuring.    However, some people think that USX chairman David Roderick, who has made his own reforms, deserves a lot of the credit. Peter Marcus, a steel analyst at PaineWebber Inc., even gives all the credit to Mr. Roderick. He describes the ex-Marine as &quot;tough-minded, confrontational and a brilliant planner,&quot; who mapped his own restructuring plan in the early 1980s and implemented it at his own pace. &quot;I don't think he was shook up at all when Mr. Icahn came in and said the stock was undervalued,&quot; he says.    These days, Mr. Icahn says Mr. Roderick &quot;is on the right track,&quot; and the old foes dine together regularly in New York. Mr. Roderick, in turn, says Mr. Icahn has &quot;expressed a great satisfaction with our strategies and with the management of the company.&quot;    Sometimes raiders' actions may diminish value. Last year the former Diamond Shamrock Corp. eluded a takeover bid by Mr. Pickens by splitting into a separately traded exploration and production unit and a refining unit. The exploration operation, Maxus Energy Corp., hasn't fared too well without extra cash flow from Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M Inc., the refining business. In January, the major credit-rating agencies downgraded Maxus' total debt of about $750 million. Moody's Investors Service cited &quot;earnings and cash flow pressures that will result in continued weak debt-protection measurements.&quot;    &quot;As an integrated company, Diamond was a better investment,&quot; says one energy analyst and former Diamond holder. Mr. Pickens says the outcome isn't his fault -- Diamond should have accepted his takeover offer. Maxus says it split up to satisfy investors' apparent preference for &quot;pure energy plays.&quot;    Southland, the Dallas-based convenience-store chain, went private last December after unwelcome takeover overtures from Canada's Belzberg family. Having retired its stock at high prices, it now has to pay interest on $5.5 billion of debt. Pre-merger, it had $2.2 billion of debt and $1.7 billion of equity. It's now trying to sell assets to pay debts and has had to cut spending.    Caesars World Inc. in 1987 managed to fend off New York investor Martin Sosnoff's buy-out proposal. &quot;And I gave up eight months of my life,&quot; adds Henry Gluck, chairman of the Los Angeles-based casino operator. Had Caesars gone private, capital spending might have suffered, and &quot;we need capital spending to maintain leadership,&quot; Mr. Gluck says. In recent years, it has spent $150 million to overhaul its Atlantic City, N.J., casino. The effort paid off. Its share of Atlantic City casino winnings went to first from seventh place.    Nobody's denying that some managers need shaking up. But do raiders always know what's needed to put them on track? &quot;Most raiders haven't had the problem of demonstrating what they can do with major companies because they haven't acquired them,&quot; contends Mr. Law of Harvard. If they did, they wouldn't know what to do with them, he says. &quot;It would be like the dog that eventually caught the car.&quot;    ---               Takeover Stocks vs. Blue Chips   Performance of Sandamp;P stocks involved in takeovers vs. performance of top money-making* stocks not involved in takeovers.
