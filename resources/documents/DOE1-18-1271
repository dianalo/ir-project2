<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-1271 </DOCNO><TEXT>The radiolytic degradation of proteins in oxygenated solution is initiatedby the attack of OH radicals at a multiplicity of main-chain and side-chainloci to give a wide variety of oxidized protein sites. A major fractionof these oxidation reactions lead to the introduction of reactive carbonylgroups into the protein co-valent structure. With {gamma}-rays the totalcarbonyl yield correspond to G(andgt;C0)sub(t) approx. 1 for a number of differentproteins. Outlined here is a sensitive chemical-spectrophotometric procedurefor quantitatively monitoring G(andgt;C0)sub(t) over a dose range of interestin radiation biology (1 to 50 Krad). Data obtained with pepsin, {alpha}-chymotrypsinand {beta}lactoglobulin are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
