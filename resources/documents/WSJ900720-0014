It's a good thing the industry's lobbying arm didn't takethat step. At least, it's a good thing for a lot ofcongressmen and senators. For despite the industry'sfinancial straits, the Keating Five scandal and publiccriticism of the league itself as a symbol of excessiveinfluence peddling, incumbents are still eagerly lining upfor campaign contributions from its PAC this campaign season.</LP><TEXT>   Already, it has contributed $233,174 to 1990 congressionalcandidates, a sum it expects to grow to $500,000 by ElectionDay. &quot;We're still being solicited,&quot; says Frederick Webber,the league's president. &quot;People aren't bashful about askingus for money.&quot; At least two or three fund-raisingsolicitations from members of Congress arrive each day at theleague's headquarters near the White House.   Even as lawmakers stampede to distance themselves from thesavings-and-loan crisis, many are still raking in PACcontributions not just from the league but from the entireindustry. Some of those who are filling their campaigncoffers with Sandamp;L-related contributions are incumbents whoseown 1990 re-election drives are being threatened by thepartisan mudslinging over the Sandamp;L issue.   &quot;Basic political sense would tell congressmen to turn offthe Sandamp;L faucet for the duration of scandal,&quot; says LarrySabato, a professor at the University of Virginia who haswritten a book about PACs.   So far in the 1989-90 election cycle, political-actioncommittees associated with thrift interests have contributedmore than $650,000 to congressional candidates, according toFederal Election Commission records and data compiled byCommon Cause. The vast majority has gone to incumbents, bothDemocrats and Republicans. By Election Day, the contributionsare likely to reach $1 million, according to several industrysources.   That's down from previous elections. In the 1987-88election cycle, thrift PACs kicked in a record $1.8 millionto congressional campaigns. (The league accounted for nearlyone-third of this amount.) In 1985-86, they gave $1.6million.   But the decline this time isn't nearly as substantial assome expected, given the number of Sandamp;L failures, the 25%reduction in the league's membership over the past 20 monthsand, most of all, the political taint that now accompaniessuch contributions.   One embattled incumbent still accepting thrift money isRep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.). Late last year, Rep. Neal, asenior member of the House Banking Committee, returned $3,350of campaign contributions that he had received from CharlesKeating Jr., the controversial former owner of LincolnSavings andamp; Loan, and his associates.   Ken Bell, Mr. Neal's GOP opponent, has also hammered thecongressman for taking in $47,100 in thrift PAC contributionsduring the 1980s and for voting with the industry on keylegislation. &quot;It's going to be the major issue in thecampaign,&quot; says Mr. Bell. Mr. Neal's district was alsoblanketed by Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby,with stinging advertisements over the July 4 holiday weekthat linked the Sandamp;L scandal directly to campaigncontributions and highlighted his PAC receipts from specialinterests.   But all that hasn't stopped the congressman from accepting$3,500 from the league's PAC for his 1990 campaign. Rep. Nealcalls the Common Cause ads &quot;scurrilous,&quot; saying thethrift-related contributions he has received over the yearsrepresent &quot;a tiny percent&quot; of his overall fund raising. Headds that several healthy Sandamp;Ls in North Carolina belong tothe league and that to turn down the group's donation forthis campaign &quot;would be saying something was wrong with ourlocal Sandamp;Ls.&quot; He says: &quot;They are decent people. I hate to seethem smeared and tarred with the same brush as some crook outthere.&quot;   Besides Mr. Neal, two other banking-panel members who areperceived as being vulnerable on the Sandamp;L issue have alsoaccepted contributions from the savings league and otherthrift PACs for their 1990 campaigns. Rep. Frank Annunzio(D., Ill.) has received $4,500, and Rep. Doug Barnard (D.,Ga.) has taken in $2,600. In addition, Rep. Charles Pashayan(R., Calif.), whose past contributions from Mr. Keating are ahot issue in his race, has received $1,600 from thrift PACs.   None of the Keating Five, the group of senators in troublefor their contributions from and intervention on behalf ofMr. Keating, are up for re-election this year. Three of them,however, have accepted small contributions from thrift PACsfor their next campaigns. Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.)and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) have each received $2,000from Sandamp;L PACs, while Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) has taken$500.   Murray Flander, Sen. Cranston's press spokesman, says thesenator is deliberately not doing much fund raising from Sandamp;LPACs for his 1992 election, despite having taken heavythrift-related contributions in the past. &quot;It's not anopportune time,&quot; says Mr. Flander, who frets that the senatormight suffer political embarrassment if a thrift contributedto his campaign and subsequently failed.   Like Sen. Cranston, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.)appears to have undergone a sudden conversion. The BankingCommittee member is eschewing thrift PAC contributions forhis 1990 campaign, and earlier this week led a protest marchto the league's office in Chicago. &quot;The league was targetedbecause it represents an industry rife with problems,&quot; saysMr. Kennedy's press spokeswoman, Sue Wood. In 1988, however,Rep. Kennedy took a $1,100 campaign contribution from theleague's PAC. &quot;If we'd known in 1988 what we know now, wewouldn't have taken money from the league,&quot; says Ms. Wood.   While the U.S. League of Savings Institutions is stillmaking money available to those who will take it, at leastone of its components isn't following suit. Earlier thisyear, the Iowa League of Thrift Institutions, the league'sIowa affiliate, decided not to make any PAC contributions tocongressional candidates.   &quot;With the thrift crisis and all the allegations aboutcampaign contributions, we've abandoned our federal PAC andjoined the efforts of Common Cause to achieve PAC reform,&quot;says Kent Klopfenstein, a member of the Iowa group.   ---                 Top Thrift PAC Recipients                                                                                                                                (1989-90)                                                                                                        Rep.
