The draft guidelines, published Wednesday in the FederalRegister, contain elaborate formulas for calculating the fines thatcompanies would be required to pay for a variety of federal crimes.   Only 350 companies, mostly small, are convicted of federalcrimes each year.   But in recent years large frauds committed by big corporationshave increased the average fine paid by companies from $48,000between 1984 and 1987 to $195,000 last year, according to studiesperformed by the commission.   ``There is no question this is a dramatic increase in criminalfines,'' said Mark Cohen, an assistant professor of management atVanderbilt University and former staff member of the sentencingcommission who studied corporate fines.   Cohen said his study of fines ``suggests that currently if youimpose a $1 harm you'll pay 20 cents to a dollar in criminalfines.''   ``But under these guidelines, it looks like the criminal penaltywill be between two and three times the harm. That could be as muchas a tenfold increase over current practice.''   The commision said in a draft policy statement that ``punishmentof a convicted organization will provide a strong incentive forowners and managers of organizations to strengthen internalmechanisms for preventing officers and employees from committingcrimes and for detecting and punishing such crimes that arecommitted.''   The proposed guidelines, which contain two basic options forcalculating fines, will be open for public comment until Feb. 15.The commission, which was created by Congress in 1987, will submitfinal guidelines to lawmakers on May 1, 1990.   The guidelines would become law unless Congress enactslegislation overturning or altering them.   The new guidelines contain a number of factors that must betaken into account when calculating how much money a company wouldbe fined.   Aggravating factors include whether top executives aided orcondoned the crimes or whether these officials tried to block agovernment investigation.   An offense that ``presented a substantial risk to the continuedexistence of a financial or consumer market'' would also expose acompany to additional fines.   Fines would be reduced for mitigating factors such as areasonable lack of knowledge of the crimes by high-level executives.   In the case of companies found to be created solely to performcriminal activity, the fine should be large enough to divest thefirm of its assets, according to the proposal.   Two years ago, the sentencing guidelines for individualdefendants took effect. They require courts to calculate thesentences according to elaborate formulas taking into accountcriminal history and the circumstances of the crime.</TEXT></DOC>
