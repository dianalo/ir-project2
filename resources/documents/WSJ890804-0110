But there would be just one problem: the government claims Mr. Neisler was ripped off in the exchange's soybean pit where 19 traders were indicted Wednesday.    The experience of the El Paso, Ill., farmer and other alleged victims points up a basic truth of commodity trading: it is almost impossible for even experienced investors to find out if they're being cheated hundreds of miles away by traders shouting at each other in a crowded pit.    It is a dilemma highlighted by the indictments Wednesday of 46 traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Although the indictments identify only a handful of the alleged individual victims, they reel off hundreds of order numbers of specific trades in which the government alleges outside customers were cheated.    They also raise many questions yet to be fully answered, such as what, if anything, brokerage firms would do to make customers whole, and whether customers themselves could take any useful action.    Mr. Neisler, 40, has used the futures markets for almost as long as the 20 years he has farmed soybeans, corn and hogs in El Paso, a town of 2,800 people, 30 miles east of Peoria. Asked if he knew much about commodities, he chuckles, pauses, and says: &quot;I thought I did.&quot;    But Mr. Neisler has found that farming 1,500 acres and raising 10,000 hogs doesn't make him an expert on fraud in the commodity business. He was surprised when a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent called him the other day to tell him he'd been cheated. And like others, he wonders, what, if anything, he can do about it.    Charles Plocar Jr. also was surprised by the revelation that he may have been cheated, but for a different reason. The Sarasota, Fla., financial adviser was certain any funny business had to have happened in the Merc's Japanese yen pit. &quot;That's where I've really been burned,&quot; says Mr. Plocar, who trades frequently for his investment purposes.    But, as it turned out, Mr. Plocar, 48, was allegedly defrauded in the futures pit he regards as most reliable: the Board of Trade's Treasury Bond pit. Mr. Plocar said he doesn't recall feeling cheated on any T-bond trades, though he regularly got his orders filled at the more expensive end of the trading range. &quot;The FBI guy said, 'don't you understand, every time that happens, he's scalping a tick off of you.'&quot;    Mr. Plocar was one of many customers of Lind-Waldock andamp; Co. whom the government alleges was defrauded by T-bond pit broker Howard J. Goberstein, who was indicted Wednesday on charges of racketeering, mail fraud, and commodities law violations. Mr. Goberstein, 33, says through his lawyer Royal Martin that he is innocent and will contest the charges.    Most customers mentioned in the indictments had no idea they'd been allegedly defrauded, and that may explain why, in the government's view, futures pit corruption has gone on unchecked for so long. Only by putting undercover agents in the pits to see stealing occur, and then tracing the trades back through brokerage houses to the customers, could wide-scale cheating be proven, prosecutors believe.    &quot;I was totally in the dark,&quot; said Claude Tardiff, a Lowell, Mass., accountant who trades futures regularly. He first heard about the alleged fraud against him in the T-bond pit from reporters who got his name out of Mr. Goberstein's indictment; neither the FBI nor Lind-Waldock called him.    Mr. Tardiff's trade was a five-contract T-bond purchase last November. &quot;It may have cost me a few (extra) bucks, but nothing major,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn't say anything unless the price was way off.&quot;    It may take other individuals longer to find out about alleged cheating. One of the victims of alleged cheating in the Merc's Swiss franc pit was said to be the Corinth Fund LP, of Prairie Village, Kan. Records of the National Futures Association identify Corinth as a commodity pool, a sort of mutual fund for commodity investors.    But John Middleton, president of a firm that the National Futures Association says runs the Corinth Fund, declined to comment. &quot;I don't know anything about it at this point,&quot; he said. He refused to give the value of the fund or the number of investors in it.    Because they can have many investors, the cheating of Corinth or other commodity pools, if it occurred, would greatly multiply the number of victims in the scandal.    For people like Mr. Plocar, the Florida financial adviser, many questions remain. If he was cheated on one trade last November, what about the scores of others he makes each year and doesn't question? And, if the government proves its case against the indicted trader, can Mr. Plocar get some money back?    David Bortman, a Chicago attorney who specializes in cases involving commodities and securities fraud, said the scandal raises some tricky issues. A practical one is whether a trader convicted under the racketeering law would have any money left when the government got through with him. A legal issue is whether brokerage firms could be held responsible for any cheating by independent brokers, who are not on their payroll.    Mr. Bortman said aggrieved customers would probably have a clearer shot at a trader who pleaded guilty to cheating them or who was convicted of such crimes.    The exchanges say customers can also file a complaint with them, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington, or the National Futures Association, the industry's self-regulatory group in Chicago.    Meanwhile, the firms that processed orders that the government alleges were illegally filled sit nervously on the sidelines.    Consider Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which claims the title of world's biggest commodity brokerage firm. According to the indictment of three traders in the Swiss franc pit, independent broker Robert D. Mosky executed more than two dozen trades that cheated Shearson customers.    Jack H. Lehman III, Shearson's director of commodities, said he hadn't seen the indictment yet. But he added: &quot;I would say that if the government proves this is the case, it certainly is a concern and I would hope we could help these customers recover money that would properly be theirs.&quot;    Mr. Lehman said he didn't know if his firm would come up with any money on its own for the customers if they were indeed cheated. He added that his firm tries to pick its independent brokers carefully, but that it can be difficult for brokerage firms to detect abuses by independent brokers. &quot;Heck, why couldn't the exchanges know what was going on?&quot; he asks. &quot;They had the obligation of surveillance&quot; of traders.    Mr. Mosky, who was charged Wednesday with racketeering conspiracy, 26 counts of mail and wire fraud and 37 counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, couldn't be reached for comment.    The exchanges have asked brokers who were indicted not to handle customer orders and to trade only for themselves.    William O'Donnell, president of Lind-Waldock, said in an interview that customers who believe they were cheated in Treasury bond futures trades with his firm should call and it will investigate.    Mr. O'Donnell said that Mr. Goberstein, the indicted Treasury bond trader, filled orders for Lind-Waldock on and off for two years, ending last February when the firm first learned he was under suspicion by the government. &quot;We knew there was a problem at that point.&quot;    Mr. O'Donnell said none of the other 45 traders indicted thus far are major Lind-Waldock brokers, and that if one of the firm's regular brokers becomes a target, the firm would take its business elsewhere. &quot;I would pull the deck,&quot; he said, referring to the broker's stack of orders.    A spokesman for Shearson Lehman, meanwhile, said the firm &quot;couldn't determine&quot; the last time it used Mr. Mosky to fill trades in the Swiss franc pit. </TEXT></DOC>
