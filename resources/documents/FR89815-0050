ADPI pointed out that the proposal to reduce the required minimum lactosecontent (the lactose purity) from 99.0 to 98.0 percent simply reflectsthe AOAC adoption of, and the industry use of, a newer and more precisemethod of analysis for the determination of lactose. For a particular sample,this new AOAC method gives a slightly lower value for lactose content thandoes the method currently prescribed by the standard of identity. The presentmethod in andSection; 168.122(d)(1)(i) is from the ``Official Methods ofAnalysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed.(1980), section 31.061_Lactose in Sugars and Sirups, Lane-Eynon GeneralVolumetric Method. The new, proposed method is from the AOAC 14th Ed. (1984),sections 31.064 to 31.071_Purity of Lactose, Liquid Chromatographic Method(high performance liquid chromatography).In support of the requested amendment, ADPI provided data from a collaborativestudy in which three laboratories participated. Thirty samples were analyzedby each of the two AOAC methods cited. In all cases where the high performanceliquid chromatography method of analysis found a percentage of lactoseof less than 99 percent for a particular sample, the Lane-Eynon generalvolumetric method found a percentage of lactose of 99 percent or greaterfor that sample.ADPI asserted that its proposed change in the standard would not resultin the sanctioning of an inferior or ``less pure'' product. It argued thatinstead, the proposed change merely recognizes that there are slight, butstatistically significant, differences in results, depending upon whichmethod of analysis is utilized.FDA acknowledges that the proposed liquid chromatographic method yieldsslightly lower values than the currently required method. However, collaborativestudies have shown that the proposed liquid chromatographic method is morereliable because it has excellent repeatability and reproducibility (Refs.1 and 2). These studies have demonstrated that this method also has excellentprecision. It was recently adopted by the AOAC as ``Official Final Action''(Ref. 3). Therefore, FDA believes that the proposed change in the methodcited in the standard of identity is appropriate and has included it inthe regulation set forth below.2. ADPI also requested a higher permitted range for the pH of lactose becauseindustry experience, using current good manufacturing practices, demonstratesthat such a higher range is reasonable. The petitioner noted that the wheyused in lactose production often results from commingling wheys of varyingpH levels from multiple sources. ADPI stated that although manufacturingmethods have not changed substantially, the use of safe and suitable pHadjusting agents in whey processing, in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1979,results in a whey with a slightly higher pH. This whey, when used as thebasic constituent in lactose production, in turn results in lactose witha slightly higher pH, thereby necessitating the requested change.FDA believes that the request from ADPI is reasonable. Based on the datapresented in the ADPI petition, FDA tentatively concludes that the higherpermitted pH range will not affect the quality, safety, or functionalityof the product. The requested change in the standard reflects current goodmanufacturing practice and is the result of several years of experiencefor the whey products industry.3. For consistency with the proposed new method for lactose determination,ADPI also suggested that the citation for the determination of loss ondrying at 120 anddegrees;C to be changed to reference the 14th edition ofthe AOAC instead of the U.S. Pharmacopeia. The procedure is the same onboth references.FDA believes that the proposed change to reference the AOAC method hasmerit because it eliminates the need for a second reference text. The agencynotes that the AOAC method in section 31.070 includes the method for thedetermination of loss on drying in the U.S. Pharmacopeia. FDA has renumberedthe paragraphs in andSection; 168.122(d) and incorporated the AOAC methodin andSection; 168.122(d)(4) (formerly andSection; 168.122(d)(2)). For furtherconsistency, FDA is proposing to update the other referenced methods ofanalysis in the standard to reflect the 14th edition of the AOAC and thenew address for the AOAC office.4. The agency believes that the requests from ADPI are reasonable, andthat the proposed changes will promote honesty and fair dealing in theinterest of consumers. The proposed new method for the determination oflactose purity will permit the use of state-of-the-art analytical methodology,leading to more precise analytical results in a more expeditious and confidentmanner. FDA does not believe that this change in procedure, or the shiftin pH of lactose, will in any way affect the quality of the standardizedfood. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to amend the standard of identity forlactose in 21 CFR 168.122 as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG>The following references have been placed on display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) and may be seen by interested persons between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="21">1.

L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C.601), FDA has reviewed this proposed rule to determine the impact on smallbusinesses. The proposed rule provides for a shift in the pH range forconsistency with current good manufacturing practice, provides for a new,more precise method of analysis for lactose content, and changes the productspecifications to accommodate the new methodology. The proposed changesare nonsubstantive and will not affect the production or marketing of lactose.Therefore, FDA certifies that this action will not have a significant economicimpact on small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment.
