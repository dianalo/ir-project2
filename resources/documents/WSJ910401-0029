Several not-for-profit groups are beginning to imitatecorporate LBO financing techniques as they seek to acquirehospitals, nursing homes and other companies that can beoperated as nonprofit ventures.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, PSL Healthcare System sold $217 million intax-exempt bonds in its efforts to acquire three hospitalsand other medical facilities in the Denver area from AmericanMedical International Inc. The board of PSL, a nonprofitcorporation, is composed of community leaders and doctors.   &quot;There are many opportunities out there&quot; for nonprofitorganizations that may want to tap the municipal bond marketto raise cash for acquisitions, said Jack Green, a principalat the Denver merchant banking firm of Green Manning andamp; Bunch,PSL's financial adviser.   LBOs were a hallmark of the 1980s mergers and acquisitionsboom. Using just a small amount of their own money, investorgroups could purchase large billion-dollar corporations byborrowing huge sums from banks and others. They often issuedjunk bonds, which are high yielding, speculative-gradecorporate securities.   The collapse of the junk bond market, rising bankruptciesof heavily indebted companies and tighter bank lendingstandards have severely reduced corporate LBO activity.   The new nonprofit deals aren't nearly as large or asheavily leveraged as the multibillion-dollar corporate LBOs.And they are not as risky; most of the tax-free bonds beingissued have been rated either at the bottom of theinvestment-grade category or the top level of the junk bondcategory.   The yields on the tax-exempt LBO bonds, while low comparedto corporate LBO bonds, are high relative to other municipalbonds with similar credit ratings.   Mr. Green expects LBOs to be used increasingly in thefuture as a way to finance the acquisition of colleges,public utilities and &quot;just about anything&quot; that can beoperated legally as a nonprofit venture.   But so far, most of the nonprofit LBOs have involvedhospitals, nursing homes and other medical-relatedoperations. In the mid-1980s, many corporations wereaggressively buying community hospitals and turning them intofor-profit organizations. But many for-profit hospital chainsare now experiencing financial problems, prompting them tosell assets to raise cash.   The most likely buyers are not-for-profit organizations,which have access to inexpensive capital through thetax-exempt bond market. A top-rated municipal issuer, forexample, currently can sell long-term bonds at yields of lessthan 7%, compared with about 9% for similarly ratedcorporations whose bonds are taxable. Long-term municipalbonds rated triple-B, the lowest investment grade rating, nowyield between 8% and 8.5%, while similarly rated corporatebonds yield 11% of more.   The relatively low cost of financing was a major reasonwhy PSL took the nonprofit route. The PSL offering wasdivided into three classes. PSL sold $140 million oftax-exempt securities that were priced to yield from between5.25% for one-year notes to 7.30% for 25-year bonds. Becausethese securities were insured by Financial SecurityAssurance, they received a triple-A credit rating fromMoody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Without the insurance, the bonds would have received amuch lower credit rating. The $47 million of securities inPSL's second class of bonds were not insured. They receivedMoody's and Sandamp;P's lowest investment-grade credit rating ofBaa and triple-B, respectively, and were priced to yield frombetween 5.75% for one-year notes to 8.88% for 30-year bonds.PSL also sold $30 million of unrated subordinated debt toColorado Trust, a private foundation that contributed $30million in equity to PSL. The bond sale was managed byZiegler Securities Inc. in Chicago.   Analysts expect to see more hospital LBOs. As for-profithospital chains seek to rein in costs, civic groups havegrown increasingly critical of the chains' operations. Somegroups have decided to buy their community health facilities,which they believe can be operated more efficiently asnonprofits.   In the case of PSL, Colorado Trust and other civic groupswere angered that American Medical stopped construction of amedical tower and medical office building that medicalpractitioners felt was needed. A portion of the cash PSLraised last week is earmarked to complete construction of thebuildings.   The motivations behind the nonprofit LBO is very differentfrom that of the corporate takeover artists. &quot;The incentivefor investors who participated in the corporate LBOs was thepotential to receive a large return on investment,&quot; saidThomas C. Sawicki, president and chief executive officer ofPSL. &quot;But our incentive is to provide community service andto gain control over local health centers. And, he adds, &quot;ourdeals are less risky.&quot; Prior to taking the helm at PSL, Mr.Sawicki was a senior vice president for divestitureoperations at American Medical.</TEXT></DOC>
