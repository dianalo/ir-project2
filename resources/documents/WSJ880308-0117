Stephen Glazier suggests on your editorial pages (Dec. 4, Feb. 12) that the president should &quot;delicately veto one item in one bill, and then wait to see what happens.&quot; This strikes me as unwise. The item veto strikes me as a good idea whose time has come, along with others common in our state constitutions.    I have taught the Florida Constitution for 14 years and studied it for many more, and for the past two years have taught the Tennessee Constitution as well. It provides an item-veto provision well adapted to our national need. The governor of Tennessee &quot;may reduce or disapprove the sum of money appropriated by any one or more items or parts of items of any bill appropriating money, while approving other portions of the bill.&quot; The legislative branch may approve a bill or item over the veto by vote of &quot;a majority of the whole number elected&quot; to each house, and a record vote is required. This provision differs from the ordinary veto, in which two-thirds of those present and voting must vote to override. Those who fear that the item veto would put too much power into the president's hands ought not fear being required to stand up and be counted -- and named -- if an indefensible use of funds or wasteful extravagance should be charged by the executive.    Of course, it is difficult to predict what political practices would follow such a constitutional change in the national government. I think it would be healthy to require Congress to go on the record should a majority wish to override a veto, and healthy to allow a majority to govern. If it is the difficulty of mustering two-thirds that inhibits our lawmakers, consider the Tennessee plan.    State constitutions are subjected periodically to popular demand for revision. The federal Constitution is not. Maybe after two centuries a Bill of Responsibilities is as much needed as a Bill of Rights was after two years with the product of the Philadelphia convention. An item veto, perhaps also a general veto that might be overridden by a majority, not just of those voting, but of the entire House and Senate, named in the record, is worth considering. Other common ideas in state constitutions include a single subject requirement, which would prevent tacking special favors onto bills that must be passed. Florida's Constitution and others forbid changing substantive law in appropriations bills. The constitutions of our states commonly forbid lending the credit of the state to private firms, although in recent years tax-abatement and industrial-development incentives have been common exceptions to the general rule. And, of course, American state constitutions compel legislators who vote the appropriations to raise the revenues.    American law schools recently have been paying more attention to the state constitutions, motivated largely by an interest in individual liberties and a perception that the Supreme Court of the United States has, under Chief Justices Burger and Rehnquist, moved away from the decisions of the Warren Court. Those state constitutions also deserve attention for the way in which the states have preserved checks and balances, especially between the legislative and executive branches.    Robert T.
