Ads for Coca-Cola, Maybelline, Snickers and other products runacross the bottom of the billboards, up to 6-by-4{-foot, whichcarry educational messages on topics ranging from physical fitnessto the U.S. Constitution.   ``They brighten up our school, which is overall beige,'' saidJennifer Knight, editor of the student newspaper at Rosemount HighSchool in a St. Paul suburb.   Ms. Knight said she saw nothing wrong with posters bearing acommercial message, but noted that ``there were some posters (inwhich) I thought the advertising was more the focus than what itwas trying to get at.''   But Jeanne M. Anderson, a first-grade teacher in White BearLake, said she and other teachers persuaded their principal to barthem from their elementary school.   ``I don't see any value with these things with the ads displayedso blatantly,'' she said in a recent interview. ``What's next? Dowe start sending coupons home with them?''   The posters have been distributed to secondary schools for threeyears and to elementary schools since last fall by WhittleCommunications, said Donna Cheek, a spokeswoman for the Knoxville,Tenn.-based company.   The posters, accompanied by teaching guides, are displayed inabout 9,000 schools in about 40 states, including more than 70schools in the Minneapolis area, the company estimates. The postersare called ``Connections'' in secondary schools and ``The BigPicture'' in elementary schools.   The ``Big Picture'' posters featuring young celebrities andother children are paid for by the advertisers, said Ed Winter, aWhittle division president and publisher of ``The Big Picture.''The company declined to say how much it earns from distribution ofthe billboards.   The billboards, Winter said, are no different from newspapersand magazines that contain advertising and are available in mostschool libraries.   The posters have won commendations for their educational value,Cheek emphasized. In May, she said, ``Connections'' received anaward from the Educational Press Association of America for anissue last fall focusing on the U.S. Constitution.   Reaction to the program ranges from acceptance to anger.   ``I've never found anything offensive,'' said AssistantPrincipal John Holliday at Rosemount High School. ``The kids inthem are typical of what we have in school here. The role modelsare good.''   At Tartan High School in the St. Paul suburb of Oakdale,Principal Lawrence Hartman said he takes a hard line againstadvertisements in schools.   ``We have categorically rejected it because it always carrieswith it some ad message. This is a captive audience here,'' Hartmansaid. ``I don't think we can utilize the fact they must be inschool...for profit.''   The company says criticisms of the billboards smack ofhypocrisy. ``Many teams have uniforms sponsored by someone in thecommunity,'' Cheek said.   Countered Ms. Anderson: ``Band uniforms don't say Mandamp;M's acrossthem.''   Reproductions of famous paintings or students' artwork would bemore fitting for hallways, said Ms. Anderson. ``I don't think theseposters do anything to boost their self-esteem.''   Lester Knight, a University of Tennessee elementary educationprofessor who is a paid member of ``The Big Picture'' advisoryboard, said the educational value of the billboards value overcomesany disadvantage of the advertising.   ``I can understand why some people might say there is a captiveaudience here,'' Knight said. ``At the same time, the ads are doneso creatively it seems they could be an impetus for some kids to docreative things.''   The American Association of School Administrators has no firmguidelines on educational messages with advertising content, saidGary Marx, the group's associate executive director. He said schoolsuperintendents should weigh the educational value against theprominence of the advertising message.   The National Association of Secondary School Principalspublishes a list of corporate promotions and activities it findsacceptable, but hasn't addressed the billboard issue.</TEXT></DOC>
