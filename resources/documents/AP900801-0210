Transfer payments also include retirement and disabilitybenefits, medical benefits, welfare, food stamps, unemploymentinsurance, veterans' benefits and various other benefits.   ``Such transfers have a stabilizing effect on rural economies,''the report said. ``Recipients continue to receive income from theprograms, even when employment and earnings fall duringrecessions.''   In 1987, when transfer payments made up 18.7 percent or $18.70of every $100 in rural income, the urban rate was only 13.7 percent.   The report was written by Robert A. Hoppe and Linda M. Ghelfi ofthe department's Economic Research Service and was included in arecent issue of Rural Development Perspectives magazine.   Big development programs to boost business and industrialenterprises have had a lot of attention over the years. Federalgrants, loan guarantees and similar aid are staple fare whenCongress talks about rural development.   A financially healthy agricultural sector also is looked upon asone way of enhancing the rural economy.   While all of these are important, the study by Hoppe and Ghelfishows that Social Security and the other transfer payments aremaking a valuable imprint of their own.   Since 1969, the report said, wider eligibility and increasedpayment levels occurred in a number of programs. In 1973, forexample, Medicare began to cover disabled people under the SocialSecurity and railroad retirement programs.   Food stamps existed in less than half the nation's 3,000counties in 1969. By July 1974, all counties were required to offerthem to low-income families.   ``Finally, people 65 and older are a growing proportion of thetotal population, particularly in non-metro areas,'' the reportsaid.   The report said 475 rural counties have a ``high share'' oftheir incomes from transfer payments. Those range from 12.3 percentin Clay County, Ill., to 25.8 percent in McDowell County, W.Va.   High-share counties were said to be concentrated in:   _Appalachia, including West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky andTennessee.   _Ozark-Ouachita area of Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.   _Other scattered areas of the South.   _Upper Great Lakes region of northern Michigan, Wisconsin andMinnesota.   _Various areas scattered throughout the West.   ``These counties are highly dependent upon retirement anddisability income because earnings per job are generally low orbecause elderly residents constitute a high proportion of totalpopulation,'' the report said.   In 1986, for example, earnings per job averaged $13,668 in thehigh-share counties, compared with $15,188 in all the non-metrocounties.   Not only do transfer payments help buffer against the effects ofrecession on local economies, the elderly and welfare recipientstend to spend their money at home.   ``This spending provides local retailers with a stable consumerbase that helps them survive recessions when the newly unemployedreduce their purchases,'' the report said.   ``Some rural development specialists even advocate attractingolder (people) because retirees can bring large amounts of transferincome with them and tend to spend their income locally.''   There are practical limits to all this, however. Building alocal economy on Social Security checks and other benefits can havesome pitfalls.   ``Local business and government leaders in areas heavilydependent on transfers should try to keep abreast of proposedprogram changes that could alter transfer payments,'' the reportsaid. ``Retirement and disability programs, in particular, shouldbe monitored closely.''   The analysis said a continued commitment by society to supportSocial Security will be especially important, since it alone paysabout three-quarters of all retirement and disability benefits.   ``Relying on the transfer income of the elderly, then, can be aviable short-run development strategy,'' the report said. ``But inthe long-run, the transfer income of the elderly may not be a ruraldevelopment panacea.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 5</NOTE></DOC>
