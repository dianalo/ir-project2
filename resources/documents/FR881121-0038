BackgroundOn July 8, 1988, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (53 FR 25910) entitled ``Controlof Drug Use in Mass Transportation Operations.'' The NPRM invited commentfrom the public on the proposed regulation which would require recipientsof Federal transit funding to have a comprehensive anti-drug program. UMTAprovided a 60 day comment period and received over 170 comments on theregulation proposed in the NPRM.In addition to receiving written comments on the regulation proposed inthe NPRM, UMTA held four public hearings across the country. These hearingswere held on July 22, 1988, in Washington, DC, on July 25, 1988, in NewYork City, on August 1, 1988, in Chicago, Illinois, and on August 31, 1988,in Los Angeles, California. Each hearing was recorded by a court reporterand the transcript of each hearing and any statements or other materialsubmitted to the hearing officer during the hearing is in the public docketto this rule. Statements made and any material submitted at the hearingswere considered in developing this final rule.B. Existing ProgramsIn the NPRM for this rulemaking, UMTA noted, at some length, a number ofstatistics regarding drug use in America, the effect of drug use on individualsand on safety, scientific data and epidemiological studies regarding druguse, and the perceived dangers of drugs in transportation generally andtransit in particular. UMTA will not repeat that information in this text,but rather notes that nothing was submitted in the docket to refute thatinformation, and UMTA incorporates that background information into thisdocument by reference.In light of that background information, it is the goal of the Secretaryof Transportation to achieve a drug-free transportation workforce. In orderto ensure that transit safety is not compromised by a failure to detectdrug user in the transit industry, UMTA believes that it is appropriateand necessary to establish a comprehensive anti-drug program at this time.UMTA's commitment to a drug-free workforce also applies to its own employees.In June of 1987, the Secretary of Transportation implemented the Departmentof Transportation's anti-drug program and in September of 1987, the Departmentbegan drug testing of employees performing sensitive safety or security-relatedfunctions.UMTA is aware that a growing number of operators in the transit industryalso are attempting to achieve a drug-free workforce and that the ideaof a comprehensive anti-drug program is not a novel concept in the transitindustry. As part of their comments to the NPRM, many transit operatorsnoted that they have already implemented drug testing and employee assistanceprograms. For example, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has had a comprehensiveanti-drug program since 1976, and an employee assistance program in placesince 1974. CTA employees are given annual physical exams to check theirfitness for duty, including drug testing. The current drug testing andrehabilitation program at CTA is a cooperative effort between CTA managementand unions. The guidelines and procedures for drug control are part ofa union contract and apply to all CTA employees. CTA considers its standardsfor testing and rehabilitation to be among the highest in the transit industry.The York Area Transportation Authority (YATA) is another transit agencywith a well established drug testing program, involving pre-employmenttesting, annual screening, and reasonable cause testing. Although YATAis a small transit agency, it has effectively administered both a drugtesting and an employee assistance program for several years. YATA's drugtesting procedures are governed by labor agreements and the employee assistanceprogram is operated through a local contractor. Currently, YATA does notrandomly test, but is considering the feasibility of instituting such aprocedure.The Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC) shares UMTA'sconcern about drug abuse in the mass transit industry. The MTC implementedan alcohol and substance abuse policy on March 5, 1987, and it includesone of the most comprehensive drug and alcohol testing policies in thetransit industry. All MTC employees and job applicants are subject to drugtesting under this policy. Specifically, MTC's policy prohibits the use,sale or possession of drugs or alcohol during work hours or on MTC property.Employees violating this policy are subject to disciplinary action up toand including discharge. The policy provides for pre-employment drug testingand testing for probable cause. State law requires post-incident testingwhen a fatality has occurred. Additionally, MTC's employee assistance programincludes rehabilitation for first time offenders. Although MTC's alcoholand substance abuse policy does not provide for the random testing of MTCemployees, it is permissible to do random testing of safety sensitive employeesunder State law.The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) efforts to providea drug free work place include an extensive Substance Abuse Policy andEmployee Assistance Program dating back to 1984. WMATA's drug preventionstrategies consist of education, awareness, drug testing, and rehabilitation.The drug testing rules apply to all WMATA employees. Pre-employment drugtests are given to applicants for bus operators and transit police, whilepost-incident testing is heavily oriented towards incidents involving vehicles.WMATA is conducting reasonable cause drug testing. The established employeeassistance program works to identify troubled employees and assist themin seeking rehabilitation.The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) shares the opinionof UMTA that drug abuse has become a major social problem and supportsthe Department of Transportation's goal of providing a drug free transportationenvironment. According to a survey conducted by APTA in 1986, of membertransit systems, more than 75 percent of those responding had written rulesand policies addressing drug and alcohol abuse by employees. Specifically,60 percent of the transit systems (large bus and rail systems) responding,had employee assistance programs in operation that they feel are workingeffectively. These programs have the strong support of labor and management,as well as the communities in which these transit systems operate.UMTA's conclusion that it is justified in requiring all Federally assistedpublic transit operations to implement a comprehensive anti-drug programto ensure the safety of the transit riding public follows from the growingproblem of drugs in society and the transit industry's own recognitionof a problem and its attempts to address the problem.C. Summary of Final RuleThis final rule requires UMTA recipients, as a condition to their reciptof Federal funds, to have an anti-drug program that meets certain requirementsfor sensitive safety employees. An anti-drug program must provide for thefollowing kinds of drug testing: pre-employment, reasonable cause, post-accident,return to duty, and random. All drug testing must be done in accordancewith the Department of Transportation's regulations at 49 CFR Part 40,by a laboratory site certified to do drug testing for Federal agenciesby the Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, an anti-drugprogram must have an employee education and training program which providesinformation about the effects of drug use and the detection of drug use.The final rule does not require any rehabilitation, though UMTA stronglyencourages recipients to provide it.UMTA is preparing detailed implementation guidelines to assist recipientsand their operators in carrying out this final rule. The implementationguidelines will include references to resources available to recipientsregarding employee assistance programs, including rehabilitation.This final rule applies to recipients of Federal financial assistance fromUMTA under section 3, 9, and 18 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of1964, as amended, and to recipients of interstate transfer transit fundsunder 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4). Any such recipient also must apply the regulationto any public or private operator providing mass transportation servicesfor the recipient with UMTA funds.The Office of the Secretary of the Department of Transportation is publishingelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>an Interim Final Rule and request for commentsentitled, ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs.''These Procedures, which will be codified in 49 CFR Part 40, are based onDepartment of Health and Human Service Guidelines for Drug Testing, withappropriate modifications to allow them to apply to private industry andState and local governments. The new 49 CFR Part 40 provides detailed informationfor implementation of the drug testing requirements of this rule, settingforth requirements for such things as specimen collection procedures, laboratoryprocedures, and quality assurance. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. General Overview of Comments</ITAG>UMTA received over 170 comments in response to the NPRM. UMTA consideredall comments filed in a timely manner and all statements and material presentedat the public hearings. During the public hearings, the Administrator andthe Deputy Administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administrationrequested information from several individuals who presented statementsat the hearings. While the comment period for the NPRM closed September6, 1988, in order to accommodate the individuals who submitted supplementalinformation as requested by the Administrator or his Deputy, UMTA consideredcomments that were submitted as late as September 12, 1988. The breakdown among commenter category is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s10,2</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Transit Operators (public and private)<D>82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cities and counties <D>26</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State DOTs <D>18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Local planning bodies/commissions <D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Medical/technical experts <D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Unions <D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trade Associations (APTA, RLEA, NASTA) <D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal agencies (NTSB) <D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Colleges <D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Individual citizens <D>7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Senior citizen organizations <D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other non-profit organizations <D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chamber of Commerce <D>1</D></ITAG></ITAG>In general, the commenters support UMTA's efforts to achieve a drug-freetransit workforce. There were, however, many differences of opinion regardingthe method of achieving that goal and the manner of UMTA's involvementin any program. The primary differences arise regarding the type and scopeof testing used to identify employees who perform sensitive safety functionsand use drugs and the choices offered to those employees who are so identified.The comments received differed by both category of commenter and the issueson which the commenter focused. The issues raised in the comments fall into two broad categories. The firstcategory of issues addressed an entire range of practical issues aroundimplementation of the rule. The second category of issues addressed someof the legal questions surrounding the issuance of the rule. Part E ofthis preamble contains a discussion of each of the issues which fall intothe first category of comments. Part F of this preamble contains a discussionof the legal questions raised by the second category of comments. E. Issues Raised in Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Pre-employment Testing</ITAG>Most commenters do not object to the concept of pre-employment drug testing.VIA Metropolitan Transit in San Antonio, Texas, suggests that the pre-employmentdrug test also should include analysis of the blood sample collected atthe pre-employment physical. However, the small operators are concernedabout the cost and administrative burden of pre-employment drug testing.One small non-profit operator says that it will affect her ability to recruitalready low-paid drivers. Another small operators requests that the pre-employmentdrug test be a condition of employment that the applicant can be askedto bear. Some commenters support giving an applicant a chance to explain a positivedrug test result. Others suggest that it places an additional unnecessaryburden on the operator. One commenter asks that the final rule clarifythat an opportunity to explain a positive result was not the same as theright to invoke an operator's grievance procedures. Most commenters are concerned that they be allowed to keep the resultsof a pre-employment drug test in the event of an EEO complaint. One commenterrequests that the final rule make it clear that refusal to take the testor failing the test is in and of itself grounds for rejection of an applicant.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>UMTA believes that pre-employment drug testingis a necessary part of an anti-drug program. Under the rule, an applicantmust pass a pre-employment drug test before he or she can be hired fora sensitive safety position. The rule does not require an employer to testeach applicant for a sensitive safety position, only the individual selectedfor the position. In keeping with UMTA's desire to provide transit employers the greatestamount of flexibility possible, the final rule is silent about notifyingapplicants of their test results or allowing applicants to explain a testresult. The final rule does however, require a transit employer to putan applicant on notice that the urine sample being collected is for a pre-employmentdrug test. UMTA encourages transit employers to clearly set out their policieswith regard to notifying applicants of their drug test results or allowingapplicants to explain their drug test results. The proposed prohibition from retaining the results of a pre-employmenttest has been removed from the final rule. Transit employers should treatthe results of a pre-employment test as they do other applicant informationin accordance with local, State, and Federal law. If a State or local lawconflicts with this regulation, a recipient may qualify for a temporarywaiver. The conditions for receipt of a temporary waiver are discussedin detail elsewhere in this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Post-Accident Testing</ITAG>One of the few issues on which there was a consensus in the comments wasthe scope of post-accident drug testing. Virtually all of the commenterswho addressed the issue believe post-accident drug testing should not belimited to fatal accidents. Many suggested the rule cover property damageand serious injury. Some suggested the final rule include all accidentsand some felt the definition of accident should be a local decision. Somecommenters noted that many transit operators already do drug testing afteraccidents which do not involve fatalities. The unions that commented seeksome limitation on the post-accident drug testing requirement where itis apparent that the accident was not the fault of the operator. The National Traffic Safety Board (NTSB) and many others believe the potential36-hour delay after an accident before an individual is tested set outin the NPRM is too long. Suggested time frames varied from 4 to 32 hours.The NTSB also recommended that UMTA require the collection of blood specimensas well as urine for all post-accident tests.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>UMTA agrees with the commenters regarding the scopeof post-accident drug testing. Under the final rule, post-accident drugtesting is required if there is a death or injury requiring an individualto be taken to a medical facility, if there is more than $5,000 in propertydamage or the accident must be reported to the Federal Highway Administration,the Federal Railroad Administration or the Coast Guard. However, in responseto employee concerns, the final rule also provides that post-accident drugtesting is not necessary if it is determined that the performance of asensitive safety employee was not a contributing factor in the accident.UMTA agrees with commenters that it is inappropriate to require post-accidentdrug testing of an employee whose performance could not have been a contributingfactor in an accident.In the NPRM, UTMA proposed that urine samples be collected within 12 hoursafter the determination that there was a death within 24 hours of an accident.This time frame was based on the possibility that difficulties may arisein locating an individual after a death which occurred some hours afteran accident or of obtaining a urine sample from the individual, especiallyif the individual was injured or the accident occurred in a remote area.UMTA is aware that extended delays in sample collection after an accidentmay result in deterioration or elimination of a drug or drug metabolitefrom an individual's system. Because the final rule requires testing inthe event a person needs to be taken to a medical facility, the determinationas to whether a post-accident test must be given can be made at the siteof the accident. UMTA encourages transit employers to make this determinationas soon as possible, particularly in cases where there is little or nouncertainty that the employee's performance was a contributing factor inthe accident.UMTA has modified the post-accident provision in the final rule to requiretesting as soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident.While this is longer than some of the time periods suggested by commenters,UMTA believes that a maximum period of 32 hours is a workable and reasonableaccommodation that is appropriate for the transit industry.The NTSB's suggestion that UMTA require an employer to conduct post-accidenttesting within 4 hours after an accident is based on the time-sensitivenature of toxicological testing of blood samples. Testing of urine samplesdoes not involve the extreme time-critical considerations associated withthe collection and testing of blood samples. UMTA believes post-accidenturine testing is sufficient at this time to determine whether an employeehad a prohibited drug or drug metabolite in his or her system.Also, UMTA proposed only urine testing in the NPRM, specifically excludingblood testing as an option for all drug tests that would be conducted underan anti-drug program required by the final rule. Therefore, UMTA considersNTSB's recommendation beyond the scope of the notice. UMTA does not adoptthe NTSB's suggestion to require post-accident testing by collection ofa blood sample.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Testing Based on Reasonable Cause</ITAG>Very few commenters were opposed to drug testing based on reasonable causealthough some commenters note that they prefer the term ``reasonable suspicion.''Many commenters ask for further guidance on what constitutes reasonablecause. Some commenters suggest that the definition should be left to thetransit employer.Many commenters supported the proposed rule's attempt to protect transitemployees from harassemnt as exhibited by the two witness requirement inthe proposed rule. Yet, almost as many commenters note that to have twosupervisors available to make the decision is ``a luxury.'' OATS, Inc.of Columbia, MO, serves 87 counties, which are divided into 7 service areas,and ther is only one supervisor per service area. Metro-Waukesha MetroTransit in Wisconsin has only 14 buses and rarely has two supervisors onduty at the same time.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>The final rule includes testing based on reasonablecause. UMTA's choice not to use the term reasonable suspicion was an editorialone for the sake of consistency within the Department of Transportation.As stated earlier, UMTA wants to afford transit employers the greatestamount of flexibility possible within the framework provided by the ruleso that their individual anti-drug programs may be best tailored to meetthe needs of their community. For this reason, the final rule does notdelineate what constitutes reasonable cause beyond requiring that the circumstancestriggering the decision to test must be articulated and substantiated byspecific contemporaneous physical indicators of probable drug use. Thiswould include observations of behavioral changes and performance indicatorsover a period of time in conjunction with contemporaneous physical evidence.Individual anti-drug programs are free to set out specific circumstancesor events which will trigger reasonable cause testing as long as the circumstancesor event meets this standard. UMTA is aware that many transit employersalready have negotiated such testing with their labor organizations. Theimplementation assistance which UMTA will make available to grantees willhave additional material on the kinds of instances or circumstances whichmeet this standard as well.UMTA is concerned that drug testing does not become a means by which transitemployees are harassed or discriminated against. Because of this concern,the final rule calls for two supervisors to make the determination to testbased on reasonable cause. However, because of the nature of many smalland rural transit operations, the rule sets up a class of ``small operators,''which consists of recipients in areas under 200,000 population or recipientsof assistance under section 18 of the UMTG Act. Under the final rule, asmall operator only needs one supervisor to make the determination to requirea drug test based on reasonable cause. However, UMTA encourages small operatorsto incorporate other protections against harassment and discriminationinto their anti-drug programs. Additionally, under the final rule, thesupervisor or supervisors who will make the reasonable cause determintionmust have received additional training regarding the circumstances andevidence necesesary to make the determination.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Random Testing</ITAG>Most commenters oppose random testing as proposed in the NPRM for a varietyof reasons. Perhaps the primary reason cited is the unsettled constitutionalityof random testing and the high rate of random testing in the NPRM. Thesesame commenters suggest delay of the rule, or at least the random testingrequirement of the rule, until the constitutionality issue is settled.They fear the high cost of litigation and questions whether UMTA wouldprovide any financial support. Many of these commenters were not opposedto the idea of random testing, but were concerned about their own potentiallegal and financial liability.Many commenters addressed the proposed rate of random testing of up to125 percent in the NPRM. One commenter felt the maximum 125 percent ratewas essential as a cornerstone to the program and ``must not be reduced.''Most felt the rate was too high, suggesting in the alternative anywherefrom 10 percent to 100 percent. Of those who commented on the questionin the NPRM regarding more latitude for operators with a high level ofsafety, virtually all favored such flexibility.Many commenters said they felt random testing was unnecessary if reasonablecause testing is authorized. This was particularly true of comments fromsmall and rural operators, who argued that the communities in which theyoperate in are ones where they would know if someone had a problem. Smalland rural operators also noted many logistical problems associated withrandomly testing small numbers of empoyees. Small and rural operators alsonoted confidentiality problems associated with randomly testing small numbersof employees. A few commenters felt the decision to randomly test employeesshould be a local one. The NTSB recommends that UMTA require the implementationof aggressive reasonable cause testing, pre-employment, post-accident andperiodic testing as well as education and treatment before requiring therandom testing.A few commenters were opposed to random testing as unconstitutional. Somecommenters noted State and local laws which prohibit or limit random testingof employees. A few commenters asked for clarification of what was randomtesting, and one suggested it be referreed to as ``unscheduled screening.''<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> The constitutionality of random testing is discussedin the next section on legal concerns. UMTA is convinced, however, thatan anti-drug program required by this final rule will withstand constitutionalchallenge and UMTA continues to believe that unannounced testing basedon random selection is a fundamental component of an effective anti-drugprogram. Unannounced, random testing has proved to be an effective deterrentto drug use and will provide safety benefits to the transit riding publicby reducing drug use by transit employees who perform sensitive safetyfunctions. Unannounced, random testing programs initiated by the military,including the Coast Guard, and private industry, show declining drug use,evidenced by a decrease in the number of individuals who test positivefor drugs, over the course of the drug testing program. A number of witnessesat the public hearings who were asked about the deterrent effect of randomtesting agreed that random testing does deter the use of drugs.In response to comments on the rate that should be required for randomtesting, UMTA has adopted a 50 percent random testing rate in the finalrule. At this time, UMTA believes that a 50 percent testing rate will providean appropriate balance between a higher or lower rate offering a sufficientdeterrent to drug use. UMTA believes the reporting required under the rulefor a 50 percent random testing rate will provide enough data for UMTAto determine if the random testing program should be revised in any manner.The 50 percent random testing rate is consistent with the random testingprogram currently applicable to sensitive safety and security-related employeesof the U.S. Department of Transportation. However, for some employers,particularly those with a large number of employees subject to drug testing,it may be a substantial burden to move from no drug testing directly toa 50 percent random testing rate. If required to have tested 50 percentof all covered employees by the end of the first year, employers mighthave to test at rates far above a 50 percent rate toward the end of theyear, to make up for lower rates at the beginning. Employers should bepermitted to start out at a lower testing rate and work up to 50 percentas experience is gained and the testing procedure becomes administrativelymore routine. We do not want to create a situation which might lead tomistakes by requiring initial testing at too high a rate.The final rule therefore provides an implementation procedure that wouldallow employers to phase in random drug testing during the first 12 monthsin which tests are conducted. Employers would not be required to reachan annualized rate of 50 percent until the last test collection. The testswould have to be spaced reasonably through the year to permit the employerto phase in to the 50 percent rate, and the total number of tests conductedwould have to be equal to at least 25 percent of the covered population.Suppose, for example, that an employer has 1000 sensitive safety employees.At a 50 percent annual rate, 500 tests would have to be conducted duringa year. Under the phase in, however, the employer could conduct only afew drug tests at the beginning of the program and then gradually increasethe number of tests until, by the end of the first year, the annualizedrate of 50 percent was achieved. Thus, if the employer's drug testing plancontemplated administering random tests on 12 occasions during the year,the employer would need to administer at least 42 tests (500 divided by12) on the last occasion, but could administer fewer tests until then.Overall, the employer would have to conduct at least 250 random tests thefirst year. In subsequent years, the 50 percent rate would be maintained.Additionally, UMTA recognizes the logistical problems facing small andrural operators. Reasonable cause testing may indeed be very effectivein small communities, however, UMTA believes that the deterrent effectof random testing will provide even further protection from employee druguse. In order to avoid some of the logistical problems associated withrandom testing, UMTA encourages States and their subrecipients, small andrural operators, to form consortia for the purpose of meeting the requirementsof this rule, but in particular to meet the random testing requirement.UMTA also recognizes that some States and local governments have laws whichprohibit or limit random testing of employees. The final rule providesthat operators that are unable to comply with this requirement becauseof State or local law may request a temporary waiver of the random testingrequirement from UMTA. UMTA may grant a temporary waiver where an operatoris making a good faith effort to eliminate the legal impediment createdby State or local law. The expiration date of a temporary waiver will beno later than December 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Return to duty testing</ITAG>A few commenters addressed this issue and all of them favored return toduty testing. One commenter noted that testing an employee who has missedwork because of time spent in a drug rehabilitation program is of significantvalue in motivating that rehabilitated employee to stay drug free. Anothercommenter noted that there should be a policy that is consistently appliedto all employees in similar circumstances in order to avoid any discrimination.One commenter said the testing should continue for one year and anothersaid it should be authorized for the duration of the employee's employment.One commenter said the number and frequency of the tests should be determinedby the employee's rehabilitation program. There were also comments to theeffect that the decision to test employees returning to duty and whetherto continue the testing for a specified period should be a local one.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>In response to these comments, UMTA is addressingthe issue of return to duty drug testing in the final rule. UMTA is concernedabout the safety of the transit riding public and thus in the final ruleis requiring that, at a minimum, a transit employer must give a returnto duty drug test to any individual who failed a post-accident, reasonablecause, or random drug test before that individual can resume performingsensitive safety duties. By including return to duty drug testing in thisrule, UMTA is not requiring a transit employer to allow an employee whodid not pass a drug test to come back to work, rather UMTA is providingthis protection in the event a transit employer is willing to allow anemployee a second chance. If an employee is given a second chance, thetransit employer also may give unannounced drug tests to the individualfor up to 60 months after the individual returns to duty. This type oftesting is the most effective means of ensuring that an employee remainsdrug free. In addition to passing a return to duty drug test, an employeewho failed a drug test or refused to take one would have to obtain a determinationfrom the medical review officer that he or she could return to duty.UMTA believes that any testing associated with an employee's rehabilitationshould be left to the employee's rehabilitation program.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Rehabilitation</ITAG>Comment was sought in the NPRM regarding four different employee assistanceprogram options with varying rehabilitation requirements.Under the first option, an employee who comes forward voluntarily or testspositive for drugs for the first time would be eligible for rehabilitationrather than be discharged. Once rehabilitated, the employee would be reinstatedinto his or her prior position. The second option would provide rehabilitationrights to an employee who comes forward voluntarily or who is identifiedas a drug user during a random test but would not require that the sameopportunity be afforded to an employee identified as a drug user in a post-accidentor reasonable cause test. In the third option, only an employee who comesforward voluntarily could claim rehabilitation rights, and anyone testingpositive for drugs could be fired immediately. Under these three proposedoptions, recipients would be free to offer more rehabilitation optionsthan proposed; the proposed options only establish minimum rehabilitationrequirements for EAP's.The fourth option would require the recipient to determine, as part ofits anti-drug program, what rehabilitation opportunities to provide. Thisis essentially a ``local option'' approach. The recipient could chooseany of the three other options as its approach or some variation of themor could choose not to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation in anycircumstance.Although many commenters agree in principle on the merit of rehabilitationfor drug abusing employees, most tended to support the fourth option regardingrehabilitation, reemployment and job security opportunities that shouldbe offered to employees. The Memphis Area Transit Authority, for example,argues that Option 4 allows recipients substantial flexibility in designingand enforcing their anti-drug programs. The Commonwealth of Kentucky contendsthat rehabilitation costs should be the sole responsibility of the substanceabuser and that it is unrealistic to expect the recipient to assume sucha financial burden.The States of Idaho and Alaska, with many small and geographically isolatedcommunities without rehabilitation programs and medical facilities, suggestthat the cost of sending an employee to an urban area for rehabilitationwould be prohibitive; Alaska urged that UMTA consider situational exemptionsfrom the rehabilitation requirement. The Southern California Rapid TransitDistrict (SCRTD) advocates that recipients be permitted to decide whatrehabilitation options to provide based on their financial resources, existingprograms (if any) and negotiated agreements. Capital Metro (Austin, Texas)supports management's prerogative to determine the circumstances underwhich an employee might be provided the opportunity for rehabilitationversus automatic termination. The American Public Transit Association (APTA)summarized many comments by stating that no single option seems to be appropriateas a nationwide standard.Labor organizations that submitted comments are strong supporters of broadEAP services and rehabilitation opportunities. The Amalgamated TransitUnion (ATU) urges adoption of Option 1 in the expressed belief that themost critical aspect of dealing with drug abuse is providing an opportunityfor rehabilitation; in addition, they believe that a second opportunityfor rehabilitation may be appropriate. Both the Transport Workers Union(TWU) and the ATU support a requirement for recipients to pay the costof all required rehabilitation; the United Transportation Union (UTU) Nationaladvocates that, because UMTA would be mandating rehabilitation, UMTA shouldshare in the financial burden of the program.Most comments regarding rehabilitation deal with the issue of whether,and under what circumstances, to offer rehabilitation and to provide jobsecurity to an employee and the length of any employee rehabilitation period.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>While UMTA recognizes the significance of the argumentsraised in defense of rehabilitation opportunities and job security foremployees who use drugs, it is important to emphasize that in this rulemakingUMTA is considering the adverse safety consequences surrounding the issueof drug use by sensitive safety transit personnel. On this basis, UMTAhas decided that recipients will not be required by this Federal regulationto offer an opportunity for rehabilitation or to provide job security toemployees who fail a drug test, who use drugs on the job, or who voluntarilycome forward and request rehabilitation. UMTA believes that the comprehensivedrug testing of sensitive safety employees, combined with an employee educationand training program, is the most effective approach to promote transitsafety and will reduce drug use in the transit community. More importantly,in this regard, UMTA is leaving it to each recipient to develop its ownpolicies regarding rehabilitation and job security in its anti-drug program.While it is understood that rehabilitation opportunities and job securityfor employees may help those employees who use drugs, there are a multitudeof managerial and labor relations issues associated with implementing arehabilitation program. In light of the many factors involved, UMTA believesthat issues such as an adequate amount of time for rehabilitation, an appropriateamount of time to receive a recommendation to return to duty in a sensitivesafety position, and job security matters are best addressed in the specificemployment context.Although, a recipient is not required to offer an opportunity for rehabilitationto any employee, to provide job security to any employee, or to providethe resources for rehabilitation, UMTA encourages recipients to considerrehabilitation opportunities and to provide job security to employees enrolledin a rehabilitation program. It should be noted that a recipient may coveran employee's rehabilitation expenses through employee benefit packages,insurance coverage, or as a matter of collective bargaining.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Education and Training Programs</ITAG>As noted in the NPRM, UMTA proposed that recipients would provide anti-drugeducation and training in addition to rehabilitation. The NPRM specifiedthe elements to be contained in the training and educational component,including a minimum time frame for the annual training of sensitive safetyemployees and their supervisors.Capital Metro states that emphasis should be placed on education and awarenessrather than on rehabilitation programs. The Washington, DC MetropolitanArea Transit Authority (WMATA) contends that their supervisors respondpositively to training programs that provide guidelines and support whenthey are faced with an employee who may have a substance abuse problem.Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (Dayton, Ohio) believes that theproposed minimum of 60 minutes of training per year is not adequate; theyrecommend a minimum of two hours per year. The Southern California RapidTransit District (SCRTD) believes that all employees require continuoustraining in brief sessions to understand the effects and consequences ofdrug use, urine sample collection and chain of custody procedures and themechanics of drug testing; in addition, SCRTD advocates that supervisorsreceive a full day of training on substance abuse information and recognition.The Amalgamated Transit Union (National) argues that other industries'experiences support its recommendation of a minimum of ten hours of annualtraining.Recipient and employee organizations differ significantly on the mechanicsand content of an education and training component of an anti-drug program.However, the majority of recipients favor local flexibility in designingthat component to meet the specific needs of the company or transit system.They argue that the scope and contents of any required education and trainingactivities should be dependent on the recipient's available resources,the extent of the drug abuse problem in the local community, the statusof existing educational programs, and the availability of outside providersof assistance for drug abuse such as public health service agencies.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> UMTA believes that a recipient should have theability to design an anti-drug education and training program that wouldbest serve its employees. The ability to tailor the program to local needsis particularly important for small recipients that may not have the financialand administrative resources to support a company-sponsored program. Therefore,although the requirement for an education and training component has beenretained, along with a list of the basic elements it should contain, thefinal rule does not specify a minimum time period (i.e., 60 minutes), exceptthat supervisors must receive at least 60 minutes of training before theyare eligible to make a determination that an employee is subject to reasonablecause drug testing. As in the case of rehabilitation, UMTA has concludedthat the extent and type of anti-drug education and training provided byrecipients to employees is best determined in the specific employment context.UMTA encourages recipients to provide employees with frequent and substantiveinformation, educational materials and training as part of an internalEAP or by contracting with community agencies, private organizations orother recipients, possibly in consortia arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. DHHS Guidelines</ITAG>The NPRM proposed that all drug testing take place in accordance with theMandatory Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs (DHHS Guidelines)of the Department of Health and Human Services (53 FR 11970; April 11,1988). These guidelines describe the collection and testing proceduresapplicable to all drug testing in the Federal Government, and they includesafeguards for the accuracy and privacy of testing.A number of commenters, including several unions, raise important questionsand concerns regarding the testing standards and laboratory selection andreview procedures covered by the DHHS Guidelines. Some commenters suggestthat UMTA allow for the procedures specified in the DHHS Guidelines orothers which are ``at least as effective'' or are ``their equivalent''.Others argued for the flexibility and timeliness that results if screeningand confirmatory tests can be done at different laboratories, the screeningbeing on-site or nearby.One commenter urges that UMTA and DHHS develop and implement a qualitycontrol and monitoring program of laboratories used to perform the drugtests. Another commented that the specimen collection procedures in theDHHS Guidelines were burdensome and, particularly in rural settings, impractical.Yet other commenters supported the unqualified adoption of the DHHS Guidelines.One commenter questioned whether the DHHS Guidelines could be incorporatedby reference in the UMTA Guidelines because they were circulated withinthe Federal Government and not issued for public comment. <T3>UMTA Response.</T3> The Department of Transportation has determinedthat certain modifications of the DHHS Guidelines are appropriate in thecontext of this and other DOT operating administration drug-free workplaceregulations. The result is the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation WorkplaceDrug Testing Programs,'' which will be codified at 49 CFR Part 40. TheseDOT Procedures are intended to preserve, to the greatest extent practicable,the important safeguards provided by the DHHS Guidelines.Some of the modifications of DHHS Guidelines are editorial in nature (forexample, references to responsibilities of ``agencies'' are changed toreferences to ``employers''). Other modifications are intended to takeinto account differences in the situations of Federal agencies and DOTregulated industries. For example, in testing at remote sites, DOT regulatedindustries may find it necessary to conduct some kinds of testing in medicalfacilities or through use of mobile units, rather than the more permanentcollection sites contemplated by the DHHS Guidelines. It may not be practicablefor regulated parties to maintain on-site permanent log books. Consequently,the DOT Procedures permit alternative collection and recordkeeping proceduresin these circumstances. The DOT procedures at 49 CFR Part 40 set the proceduralstandards for urine drug tests in the transportation industry.49 CFR Part 40 limits both the screen test and the confirmation test toa single technology: immunoassay and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS), respectively. Although commenters saw this limitation in the DHHSGuidelines as unduly restrictive, UMTA believes that the established reliabilityof the tests and procedures in 49 CFR Part 40 are necessary to ensure theintegrity of a drug testing program. If better analytical methods are validatedand available at a reasonable cost, UMTA can revise this rule to recognizethe technological advance.The final rule requires recipients to use only laboratory sites which arecertified by DHHS to do drug testing for Federal agencies. The DHHS certificationprogram is the first rigorous certification specifically targeted at urinedrug testing at the Federal level. The DHHS Guidelines provide nationalstandards for recognition and periodic review. UMTA is not prepared toaccept accreditation by voluntary bodies absent DHHS recognition. UMTAbelieves DHHS certification of laboratory sites that do drug testing isan essential element to ensuring quality analysis of drug tests. UMTA hasbeen assured that there will be sufficient capacity at certified laboratorysites to provide quality analysis for the entire transit industry.All comments received during this rulemaking will be incorporated in thedocket for the Office of the Secretary (OST) interim final rule creating49 CFR Part 40. The OST will respond to those comments, as well as commentsreceived during the comment period for Part 40, in its notice followingthe end of that comment period.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Medical Review Officer</ITAG>UMTA received several comments on the qualifications and duties of theproposed Medical Review Office (MRO). Although two commenters mentionedthe cost implications, all of the commenters recognized the necessity ofthe function and the value of the services. Several commenters sought clarificationof those matters which management must decide with medical advice and thosedecisions that could be reserved to the MRO. All but one commenter addressingthe issue urges that the rule provide flexibility to each recipient todecide exactly how to define roles and responsibilities.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> It was apparent from the comments that there wassome confusion regarding the role of the MRO. The final rule incorporatesall aspects of 49 CFR Part 40 pertaining to the qualifications, dutiesand responsibilities of the Medical Review Officer. An MRO must be a licensedphysician. However, the rule does not require a recipient to hire a physician,the recipient only needs to arrange for the services of a physician toact as MRO. The rule allows a recipient to have more than one MRO basedon organizational unit or employee work location, if necessary. Under 49 CFR Part 40, the MRO's responsibility is to receive, review, andinterpret all positive drug test results. The MRO makes the determinationthat the results of a drug test are valid and the determination whethera positive drug test result has a legitimate medical explanation. The MROmakes the determination whether a positive drug test result has a legitimatemedical explanation only after reviewing any medical information submittedin confidence by the employee. If the MRO determines that a confirmed positivedrug test result has a legitimate medical explanation, the MRO reportsto the recipient or operator that the individual passed the drug test.The MRO is also responsible for determining whether an employee who didnot pass a drug test or refused to take one may return to duty.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Confidentiality</ITAG>Commenters raise a number of concerns regarding the issue of confidentiality.A significant number of commenters in particular oppose UMTA's proposalin the NPRM regarding pre-employment testing that, if the applicant isnot hired, no record of the test results shall be maintained by the recipient.A common theme of the comments in this regard is reflected in this statementfrom one submission: ``if a recipient does not retain a record of testresults, on a strictly confidential basis, it could be left defenselessin a later claim under the equal opportunity laws or other legal provisionsgoverning hiring by public agencies.''A number of commenters express concern about the release of confidentialinformation generally. A union, for example, suggests that test resultsshould be kept confidential unless an employee provides written consentto the release of the information.A commenter from California noted the existence of a State statute regardingthe withholding of public employee records and suggests that the UMTA finalrule might be in conflict with this provision.<T3>UMTA Response. </T3>UMTA has included a provision in the final rulethat will govern release of records of an employee's drug testing resultsand any rehabilitation information. UMTA has decided that the legitimateindividual privacy rights of an employee warrant strict limitations onthe availability of an employee's drug testing results. The final ruleprovides that the test results of an individual may be released only withthe written consent of the individual. In addition, the final rule eliminatesthe NPRM requirement that the results of a preemployment test of an applicantnot be maintained. UMTA recognizes the importance of such information inthe event of a lawsuit or complaint about a failure to be hired. Accordingly,the regulation does not preclude the information from being maintainedby the recipient but, as discussed above, any such information may be releasedonly with the applicant's written consent.Regarding the comment about the California statute, UMTA is aware thatthere are other state and local laws which may pose similar problems. However,once this rule becomes final and is implemented by a recipient, to continueto receive Federal transit funds, the recipient must comply with all ofits requirements, including that which allows the release of data onlyupon written consent of the affected individual. The final rule does havea provision for a temporary waiver of certain requirements of the rule,if they are in conflict with state or local law. This waiver provisionis discussed more fully under the heading `Period for implementation'.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Recordkeeping and Reporting</ITAG>Several organizations provided comments to UMTA regarding the reportingrequirements of the proposed rule. The Dayton, Ohio Miami Valley RegionalTransit Authority (RTA) deemed semi-annual and annual reports appropriateand recommended that the reports include summaries such as: the occupationalgroups tested, drugs identified, and disposition of employees; RTA furthersuggested that statistics should be grouped by category of test. The Austin,Texas Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority supported annual reportingthat could provide UMTA with general statistical information such as jobtitle, category of test, number of tests given and a summary of test results.Long Beach (California) Transit did not object to an annual reporting requirementand generally agreed with Capital Metro's expression of support for inclusionof data in summary format to ensure the confidentiality of the information.The Topeka Metropolitan Transit Authority recommends that UMTA providethe necessary reporting forms with proper instructions for completion andsubmission. A few commenters objected to semi-annual or annual reportsas overly burdensome and at least one organization recommended that theTriennial Review process could serve as the proper mechanism to evaluatethe effectiveness of each recipients' anti-drug program.There was a general consensus against the separate reporting post-accidenttest results for fatal accidents immediately after an accident. The Cityof Waukesha (Wisconsin) Transit System Utility suggested that positivepost-accident test results are an issue and a problem to be resolved bythe employer and the employee, and that UMTA's efforts should be focusedon utilizing general statistical trends to assess the effectiveness ofits anti-drug regulation.,In light of its overall support for the compilation and resporting of generalizeddata on a semi-annual and annual basis, Long Beach Transit questioned thebenefit gained by reporting to UMTA after each positive post-accident drugtest result.There was substantial opposition to UMTA's proposed requirement that ifan applicant is not hired, no record of the tests results will be maintainedby the recipient. Both OATS, Inc. (a private, not for profit service providerbased in Columbia, MO) and the Iowa State Department of Transportation(IDOT) point out that destruction of an otherwise qualified applicant'sapplication records (including pre-employment drug test results) preventa recipient from producing evidence that an employment offer was withheldfor a valid and legal reason; further it might not be possible to provethat affirmative action and equal employment opportunity requirements hadbeen met. Clark County, Washington agreed that test records are importantdocuments in defending against claims brought by a applicant subsequentto the recipient's decision to not employ the applicant; premature destructionof the records could expose the recipient to unnecessary liability andhamper any legal defense it may care to develop. A concern was expressedby Waukesha that applicants who previously test positive might reapplyat a later date, and that they view a three year record retention policyas a reasonable management practice that would be very helpful in thateventuality. The Idaho State Department of Transportation (IDOT) arguedin favor of destruction of drug test records of an applicant who testspositive and who is subsequently not hired; they expressed concern thatsuch information could lead to future discrimination of rehabilitated substanceabusers.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> The regulatory provisions that require a recipientto submit summary reports of the recipient's program are critical measuresto provide oversight of the industry's implementation of the comprehensiveanti-drug program. UMTA believes that these minimal requirements are necessaryto properly monitor the effectiveness of the program and to ensure compliancewith the final rule. In addition, evaluation of the industry's implementationof the anti-drug program and of test results will enable UMTA to reviewany demonstrated trends of drug use in the transit industry and to modifythe final rule if warranted by the data.The proposed recordkeeping and reporting provisions have been modifiedin the final rule. UMTA is persuaded that the proposed requirement forimmediate reporting of post-accident test results would be cumbersome andan unnecessary management chore, and has therefore not included it in thefinal rule. UMTA also has clarified the requirements and organization ofmaterial that must be submitted in the recipient's semi-annual report.In order that UMTA may accurately assess information submitted by a recipient,the final rule provides that the recipient must submit:(1) The total number of drug tests administered;(2) The number of drug tests administered in each occupational category(e.g., vehicle operator);(3) The number of drug tests administered in each testing category (i.e.,pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable cause, random, and return toduty);(4) The number of post-accident drug tests administered in each accidentcategory (i.e., fatal, personal injury, or property damage);(5) For each post-accident test, the number of hours between the accidentand the collection of a urine specimen;(6) The total number of individuals who did not pass a drug test;(7) The number of individuals who did not pass a drug test by occupationalcategory (e.g., vehicle operator);(8) The number of individuals who did not pass a drug test by testing category(e.g., reasonable cause);(9) The number of individuals who did not pass a postaccident drug testby accident category (e.g., fatal);(10) The disposition of each individual who did not pass a drug test;(11) The number of drug tests submitted to the laboratory that showed evidenceof one or more prohibited drugs or drug metabolites in the immunoassayscreen in a sufficient quantity to warrant a confirmatory test;(12) The total number of drug tests submitted to the laboratory that showedevidence of one or more prohibited drugs or drug metabolities in the confirmatorytest in a sufficient quantity to be reported as positive to the medicalreview officer; and(13) The number of drug tests submitted to the laboratory that showed evidenceof one or more prohibited drugs or drug metabolite in the confirmatorytest in a sufficient quantity to be reported as positive by category (i.e.,marijuana, cocaine, opiate, PCP, or amphetamine).Because most drug testing laboratories report much of this informationwhen reporting summary drug test results to the recipient, UMTA does notanticipate that the reporting requirements will be overly burdensome. However,in the case of multimodal recipients, the data must be broken down by mode.UMTA believes that the semi-annual reporting requirement is necessary andvital to gain a timely understanding and to evaluate the effectivenessof the anti-drug program. However, UMTA anticipates that the semi-annualreporting requirement will be modified or possibly eliminated within thenext three to four years, if it is incorporated into the annual Section15 reporting process.Additionally, UMTA has withdrawn the proposed requirement that if an applicantis not hired, no record of the test results will be maintained by the recipient.In response to numerous comments, the recipient must retain all recordsrelated to the collection process and the reports of individuals not passinga drug test, regardless of the category of the test, for at least fiveyears. The recipient must retain the reports of individuals passing a drugtest for at least one year. Additionally, the medical review officer mustkeep the reports of individual test results that do not pass a drug testfor at least five years and of individual test results that pass a drugtest for at least one year. These records are subject to limited release,as discussed in Section 653.31.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Small Operators</ITAG>The single issue raised by the NPRM that elicited the most comments wasthe impact of the proposed rule on small agencies and operators. Commentson this issue came from individuals, small entities both public and private,several States and several national organizations. Large operators alsospoke out on behalf of the smaller agencies. The comments requested specialconsideration for groups variously categorized as the recipients of federalfunds under section 18, section 16(b)(2) recipients, and other groupingsdefined by size of vehicle fleet, levels of employment, and numbers ofsafety sensitive positions.Many of the commenters stated, and a number cited evidence that, rural,small, and specialized operators had ``no safety problem'' or a ``better''or ``much better'' safety record than transit as a whole. Several wenton to describe only very small or nonexistent drug problems in that goodsafety record.Comments also emphasized the small size of the administrative staffs inmost small systems. Frequently the manger splits his time between managingand driving and there are no other support personnel.Among the concerns expressed, generally in order of importance, include:andbullet; The cost to administer, cost to test, cost to rehabilitate, costas a percentage of operating budget, as a percentage of Federal grant;andbullet; The high level of personal and institutional development necessaryto create and administer effective programs;andbullet; The time needed to develop the required management capacity andto negotiate labor contracts and other agreements;andbullet; Logistic and operational complexities imposed on small geographicallydispersed systems (e.g., back-up drivers, collection sites, Medical ReviewOfficers);andbullet; The difficulties presented by irregular employment arrangementsincluding part-time and voluntary worker and high employee turnover;andbullet; The potential exposure to legal challenge and the costs associatedwith litigation and damages; andandbullet; The apparent inequities resulting from requiring recipients offunds under section 18 to have an anti-drug program, but not recipientsunder section 16(b)(2).In almost all comments, particular emphasis was placed on the special burdensimposed by the proposed random testing requirement and the proposed maximum125 percent sampling rate. Relief was proposed in a variety of ways: establishnew Federal assistance programs to fund the costs of the required drugprograms; exclude from the rule agencies by funding category, size, orthe demographics of their service area; eliminate one or more of the testcategories from those required of smaller operators; eliminate other programelements from the requirements such as EAPs and/or rehabilitation; extendthe period allowed for implementation of one or more of the program requirements;stagger or phase implementation time-tables; establish State or Nationalprograms to administer the required drug control activities; impose requirementsselectively on those with a demonstrated drug problem; establish a Federalprogram to bear the costs of defending against legal challenges to agencyactions in compliance with the rule; make EAP programs voluntary for smallsystems, also training; allow exemptions and waivers from some DHHS Guidelinerequirements; allow for and promote development of private providers ofall services necessitated by the rule; reduce the sampling rate for therandom testing program to something like 50 percent instead of 125 percent;allow more time to accomplish the post accident test; and allow for entiredrug program or specific aspects to be accomplished by State Governmentand State or local police.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> Upon review of the docket, UMTA found several argumentsmade on behalf of small entities to be persuasive. UMTA has therefore preparedthe final rule to accommodate small entities. UMTA has excluded all recipientsof section 16(b)(2) funds from coverage under the rule, although UMTA willbe studying data on this issue to determine whether some future rulemakingto cover section 16(b)(2) recipients might be warranted. UMTA has increasedthe implementation period for large recipients from 6 to 12 months, UMTAhas increased the implementation period for section 18 recipients and othersmall operators from 6 months to 24 months; and UMTA has selected a rehabilitationoption making all aspects of that program element voluntary.UMTA has excluded volunteer workers from the mandatory coverage of therule.UMTA is requiring the State to certify compliance with the rule for allsensitive safety employees of section 18 recipients. This is consistentwith UMTA's administration of section 18 program, and allows the Statesto establish Statewide requirements or to pass the requirements throughto subrecipients.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Covered Employees</ITAG>In the NPRM, UMTA sought comment on which employees should be subject tothe drug testing rule. The NPRM proposed that all employees in sensitivesafety positions would be covered, including vehicle operators, controllers,and mechanics. The NPRM specifically asked whether this definition wasbroad enough or whether other categories of employees also should be covered.A number of comments were received on this point. Some commenters suggestthat the rule should not be limited in its application to sensitive safetyemployees. Rather, these commenters argue that all of a recipient's employeesshould be covered in order to emphasize the importance of a drug-free workplace,and to assure that all employees are subject to the same requirements.The National Transportation Safety Board, for example, supports the inclusionof all employees who perform sensitive safety functions.On the other hand, other commenters did not specifically recommend thatcertain categories of employees be covered or excluded from coverage ofthe definition. Rather, these commenters suggest that each recipient shouldbe given the flexibility to itself determine which employees perform safetyfunctions sufficient to bring them under the definition. The transit industry'sassociation, the American Public Transit Association (APTA), for example,supports this approach by recommending adding the phase ``as defined specificallyin the local program'' at the end of the last sentence of the definition.``This would permit each transit system to tailor the definition of safetysensitive position to their own needs and circumstances, while still providingadequate guidance.'' (APTA also recommended that UMTA use the term ``safetysensitive position'' rather than ``sensitive safety'' to parallel the usagein the transit industry.) Other commenters suggest that the definitionbe defined as broadly as possible so long as the recipients are able tospecifically decide which employees come under the category.Many small operators suggest that the rule should not apply to their operationsgiven their size, their ability to closely supervise employees, and theadministrative and economic burdens that would result from the applicationof the rule to their operations. Consequently such commenters did not generallydiscuss which employees should be considered sensitive safety, except forthe issue of volunteers, discussed below.A few commenters representing large transit authorities suggest that securitypersonnel should be considered sensitive safety employees under the rule.A New York City transit authority states that ``* * * all security-relatedpositions should be subject to a drug testing program for the same reasonsthat sensitive safety positions are and, in addition, because there isa higher burden placed on these employees to secure property and protectother employees and the riding public. Failure of such employees to performtheir duties effectively could interfere with the safe operation of theauthority and place the public at risk.''Regarding temporary employees, in the NPRM UMTA specifically asked forcomments on whether such employees should be subject to rehabilitation,and thus few comments were received on the question of whether temporaryemployees should be covered by the rule. One State Department of Transportationstates that all safety employees, full-time and temporary, should be subjectto drug testing, especially pre-employment testing.A significant number of small operators ask whether the rule was meantto apply to volunteers in sensitive safety positions. These commentersnote that small systems particularly rely on volunteer drivers, many ofwhom are elderly, and suggest that this very needed and useful voluntaryservice would be seriously affected if such volunteers were to be subjectto the anti-drug regulation.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> UMTA in the final rule will continue to limit therule`s coverage to sensitive safety employees. We believe we have no basisto extend the coverage of the rule to all of the employees of a transitsystem. Moreover, this would significantly increase the cost of the finalrule. Recipients are reminded, however, that the rule establishes minimumrequirements and does not prevent a recipient from establishing on itsown a program that exceeds the rule's requirements.UMTA does not agree with those commenters who suggest that each recipientshould have the flexibility to decide which employees are to be consideredsensitive safety and therefore subject to the rule. The rule should beuniform with respect to applicability to all recipients. In so deciding,however, we recognize that a more specific definition of the term sensitivesafety is necessary and have therefore added a detailed provision in the``Definitions'' section of the rule. It provides that such employees arethose with duties related to the safe operation of transportation serviceby a recipient, including operating a revenue service vehicle; controllingdispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle; maintaining a revenueservice vehicle or equipment used in revenue service; and those who superviseindividuals performing such sensitive safety functions. UMTA recognizesthat even within the context of this more specific definition there maybe questions about whether particular employees are covered, and recognizesthat a recipient will have to make these determinations on a case-by-casebasis, taking into consideration the extent of the employee's potentialimpact on safety.UMTA has not included security personnel in the definition of ``sensitivesafety''. However, UMTA agrees with the commenters who contend that securityworkers are involved in helping to provide safe transportation, and UMTAstrongly encourages recipients to consider including security personnelin an anti-drug program.UMTA has considered carefully the issue of whether volunteers should besubject to the rule. UMTA is persuaded by the comments of small operatorswho contend that coverage of this category under the rule might discourageindividuals from volunteering their services, and have decided to excludevolunteers from the applicability of the rule. UMTA encourage those recipientsthat use volunteers to consider asking them to voluntarily place themselvesunder the recipient's anti-drug program.Finally, part-time and temporary employees are included in the definitionof ``sensitive safety'' employees. UMTA simply finds no basis to excludesuch workers from the drug testing program, and agree with those commentersrecommending their coverage under the rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">14. Private Operators</ITAG>Comments to the docket on this issue were limited. Commentators were concernedwith the cost implication of the requirements, particularly in a competitiveenvironment. They saw the control of drug program costs to be a significantnew management task and one that would have a significant impact on theircompetitiveness. At the same time, both private operators and the publicagencies with which they were under contract saw no alternatives to includingprivate sensitive safety employees under the drug rule if the current growthof competition and private participation in public transit was to continue.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> The rule covers employees of private companiesproviding mass transportation services for a recipient if the employeesperform sensitive safety functions. It is important to emphasize that itis the responsibility of the recipient to ensure, and certify to UMTA thatany private operator with employees in this category complies with thisrule.<ITAG tagnum="81">15. Alcohol</ITAG>Some commenters suggest that while drugs are a problem generally in society,alcohol abuse is an even greater problem. They argue that the rule shouldbe broadened to cover alcohol abuse among sensitive safety transit employeesas well.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> UMTA is concerned about impairment resulting fromthe abuse of other substances, principally alcohol. We believe, however,that this rulemaking will best accomplish a useful purpose by addressingonly controlled substances. Although both alcohol and controlled substancesmay result in impairment in a driver's ability to control his or her vehicle,and although current law and regulations prohibit a person from drivingwhile under the influence of either, certain differences are evident. Thepossession and use of controlled substances is nearly always illegal, whilealcohol consumption is in many circumstances legal. Because of the legalityof alcohol and its widespread use, most people have enough contact withusers to recognize the indicators of its use. The appearance and actionsof a person are often clear evidence of alcohol impairment.Because alcohol is a legal substance, it is necessary to establish violationof existing prohibitions and actual impairment due to use, rather thansimply establishing use, as is done in instances where illegal drugs areused. In instances where chemical testing is used, it would be to determinethe degree of alcohol impairment. Testing will often be of a differenttype than is used to determine the use of drugs. UMTA is not prepared atthis time to mandate blood testing programs. However, this regulation orother UMTA policy in no way prevents a recipient from instituting a programof chemical testing for alcohol use. Such testing could be done eitherin conjunction with an anti-drug program under this rule or separately.Moreover, on October 4, 1988 the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)issued a final rule at 53 FR 39044 regarding the use of alcohol by driversthat will affect many UMTA recipients. Under section 12008(f) of the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570), among other things,the FHWA has established a BAC level of 0.04 percent as the standard forwhen a person is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol whiledriving a commercial motor vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="81">16. Period for Implementation</ITAG>Many commenters present views on this issue. In the NPRM, UMTA proposedthat the rule would have to be implemented within 180 days of its effectivedate. Commenters uniformly contend that this is too short a period of timefor implementation of the anti-drug rule. The American Public Transit Association,for example, states that, ``* * * a deadline of 180 days is too short atime frame to require transit systems to establish and implement a drugprogram in compliance with the UMTA regulations.'' The Association alsolists a number of administrative and legal barriers to implementing therule in 180 days, and recommends that a 12-month period of time be providedfor a recipient to establish and implement its anti-drug program.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> UMTA is persuaded by the many comments on thisissue that 180 days is too brief a time period for implementation. Accordingly,the rule provides that for recipients (other than small operators) thetime period for implementation is 12 months from the effective date ofthe rule (which is 30 days after the date the rule is published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>). Moreover, recognizing that small operatorswill need more time to implement the rule, UMTA is providing such recipientswith 24 months to implement the rule. ``Small operators,'' discussed inmore detail elsewhere, are section 18 recipients, and those recipientsin urbanized areas of less than 200,000 in population. The rule also permitsa recipient to seek a temporary waiver from this implementation periodif the recipient is unable under State or local law to comply with theregulation.A request for a temporary waiver must include a legal opinion regardingthe conflict between the rule and the state or local law, an indicationof how the recipient is addressing the conflict at the State or local level,and an estimate of how long it will take to resolve the conflict. A temporarywaiver will specify which provisions are being waived and a date on whichthe waiver expires. The expiration date of a temporary waiver will be nolater than December 31, 1989. A recipient must certify compliance withall provisions not included in the waiver within the 12 or 24 month requirement.A recipient then must certify compliance with the provisions included inthe waiver within 12 months after the expiration date of the waiver.F. Legal Concerns Raised In Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Constitutionality</ITAG>A number of commenters question the constitutionality of drug testing programsfor transit personnel. UMTA recognizes that there are legitimate and significantconstitutional concerns surrounding drug testing in general and randomtesting in particular. UMTA acknowledges the current widescale litigationand apparent disparate judicial opinions on drug testing programs.<T3>UMTA Response.</T3> Although the state of the case law is evolvingin rapid fashion and the Supreme Court has not resolved many of the relevantand complex issues, UMTA is confident that testing of employees under thisrule will withstand judicial scrutiny on constitutional grounds.Of particular concern to the commenters is the relevance of the FourthAmendment to drug testing. The principles of the Fourth Amendment to theU.S. Constitution are paramount in scrutinizing the fundamental legalityof many drug testing programs. As a threshold matter, the Fourth Amendmentapplies to ``searches'' conducted or mandated by the government and protectsindividuals against ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' A second issue concerns whether urine tests under these programs are ``searches''within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Although most courts to addressthe issue to date have ruled that toxicological testing of employees forthe purpose of determining fitness for duty is a search within the meaningof the Fourth Amendment, the issue is not entirely settled. <T3>See Wyman v. James, </T3>400 U.S. 309, 317-338 (1971) (government welfarecaseworker's ``home visit'' as a precondition for assistance payments isnot a Fourth Amendment search). <T3>See also, Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga, </T3>1988 U.S. App. Lexis6952 (6th Cir. May 23, 1988) (Guy, J., dissenting); <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab, </T3>808 F.2d 10057,1060, 1062 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham, J., concurring). <T3>Cf</T3>. <T3>Mack v. United States, F.B.I., </T3>814 F.2D 120, 125 N.2 (2nd Cir.1987). Also assuming, <T3>arguendo, </T3>that urine tests of transit personnel for prohibitedsubstances are ``searches'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,it is clear that while searches ordinarily must be conducted pursuant toa warrant issued on probable cause grounds, such a requirement is not alwaysnecessary. <T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </T3>413 U.S. 266,277 (1973) (Powell,J., concurring). Where, for example, ``* * * the burden of obtaining awarrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search* * *,'' the Supreme Court has routinely held that a warrant is not requiredby the Fourth Amendment [citing <T3>Camara v. Municipal Court, </T3>387 U.S. 523, 533 (1967)]. <T3>See e.g., Griffin v. Wisconsin, </T3><T2>XXX</T2> S.Ct.<T2>XXX</T2> (1987) (plurality opinion); <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. at 340-342; <T3>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </T3>428 U.S. 543, 560-561 n.<T2>XX</T2> (1976) (while ``* * * some quantum of individualized suspicionis usually a prerequisite to constitutional search or seizure[,] . . .the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion'').Rather, ``[t]he fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searchesand seizures be reasonable * * *.'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. at 340. In determining the reasonablenessof a search, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the importance ofthe facts particular to the search while acknowledging that the test ofreasonableness ``* * * is not capable of precise definition or mechanicalapplication.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish, </T3>441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In analyzing a drugtesting program, ``* * * what is reasonable depends on the context withinwhich a search takes place.'' <T3>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. at 337. In scrutinizing whether a particular search comports with the Fourth Amendment,courts have adopted a balancing test. In general, to support a claim thata search of an individual or the individual's property is reasonable, thegovernment must demonstrate that, on balance, ``the government's need forsupervision, control and the efficient operation of the workplace'' outweighsthe individual's legitimate expectation of privacy. <T3>O'Connor v. Ortega, </T3>480 U.S.<T2>XXX</T2>, 107 S.Ct. 1492, <T2>XXX</T2> (1987). <T3>Also see e.g., United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, </T3>473 U.S.531, 537 (1985); <T3>United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, </T3>462 U.S. 579, 588 (1983);<T3>Delaware v. Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979). Thus, the courtsmust ``* * * consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the mannerin which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and theplace in which it is conducted.'' <T3>Bell v. Wolfish, </T3>441 U.S. at 559. Thus far, a number of courts have held or suggested in <T3>dicta </T3>that testing upon reasonable suspicion alone may be inadequate.Reasonable suspicion testing allows inquiry only after a problem manifestsitself at work. <T3>See, Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1279 v. Cambria County TransitAuthority, 691 F.Supp. 898 </T3>(W.O. Pa. 1988). Furthermore, these courtshave allowed drug and alcohol testing in the context of a pre-employmentphysical or routine health examination. <T3>See, e.g., Cambria County Transit Authority </T3>(drug and alcoholtesting during annual physical examinations does not violate employee rightsunder the fourth amendment; individualized reasonable suspicion not required);<T3>Wrightsell v. City of Chicago, </T3>678 F.Supp. 727 (N.D. Ill. 1988)(drug testing of police officers as part of routine, reasonably required,employment-related medical examination is permissible where there is clearnexus between test and employer's legitimate safety concern); <T3>McDonnell v. Hunter, </T3>612 F.Supp. 1122, 1130 n. 6 (S.D. Iowa 1985)(Fourth Amendment does not preclude taking body fluid specimen as partof pre-employment physical or as part of routine periodic physical examination),<T3>aff'd as modified, </T3>809 F.2d at 1302 (8th Cir. 1987); <T3>Jones v. McKenzie, </T3>833 F.2d 335, 341 (D.C. Cir. 1987) Pet. forcert. filed, No. 87-1706, April 15, 1988), (not unreasonable to requiredrug testing where an employee's duties involve direct contact with youngschool children and other physical safety, where the testing is conductedas part of a rountine employment-related medical examination and wherethere is a clear nexus between the test and the employer's legitimate safetyconcern). Moreover, as the court in <T3>Cambria County Transit Authority </T3>held, such testing serves thelaudable goal of fostering a drug free and sober workforce as well as identifyingthose employees with serious drug problems. Viewed in this light, it is beyond dispute that the public has an overridinginterest in assuring that sensitive safety transit personnel perform theirduties free of prohibited substances. The drug problem in society in generalwas discussed in the NPRM. The impairing effects of drugs and the substantialrisks to public safety posed by sensitive safety- or security-related transitpersonnel who use drugs underlie the compelling governmental interest inpromulgating this rule. In contrast, the drug testing requirements of the final rule involve aminimal invasion of privacy. As the Supreme Court has indicated, wheresearches are undertaken in situations where individualized suspicion islacking, other safeguards must be relied upon to ensure that the discretionof the party conducting the search is properly defined and the scope ofthe search is limited. <T3>See Delaware v. Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. at 654-655 (footnote omitted);<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987). The drug testing requirementsof the final rule place significant constraints on an employer's discretionin conducting drug testing. For example, the requirement for random drugtesting calls for selection of an employee to be tested in a scientifically-acceptablemanner, such as use of a computer-based random number generator. Requirementsfor testing based on reasonable cause or post-accident testing also areseverely circumscribed in order to limit an employer's discretion in administeringthese tests to employees. Moreover, recipients will be required to havean anti-drug program in accordance with the provisions of the final rule,to ensure that discretion is in fact limited in the administration of drugtests under the anti-drug program. <T3>Cf</T3>. <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan, </T3>685 F.Supp. 1346,1352-53 (E.D. La. 1988) (holding that the constitutionality of an ExecutiveOrder requiring Federal agencies to establish drug testing programs forFederal employees was not ripe for review since each agency had not implementeda finalized, particular plan). The actual testing procedures that each employer is required to implementunder this final rule also are narrowly tailored to respect an employee'sreasonable expectations of privacy. The Departmental regulations at 49CFR Part 40 governing collection of urine samples, as referenced in thefinal rule, are based on the DHHS Guidelines which were carefully designedto preserve privacy while protecting the integrity of the sample. The finalrule contains a number of important employee safeguards, including privacyduring collection under most types of tests, stringent laboratory safeguards,and provisions for challenging results. Other employee drug testing programsincorporating the collection and testing procedures of the DHHS guidelineshave been upheld against constitutional attack. <T3>See American Federation of Government Employees v. Dole, </T3>670 F.Supp. 445 (D.D.C. 1987), appeal filed, No. 87-5417 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 11,1987) (upholding the constitutionality of the Department of Transportationprogram for random drug testing of safety- and security-sensitive agencyemployees); <T3>National Association of Air Traffic Specialists v. Dole, </T3>2 Ind.Emp. Rts. Cases (BNA) 68 (D. Alaska 1987) (denying a motion for a preliminaryinjunction against the Federal Aviation Administration's use of urinalysisdrug testing as part of an annual physical examination of the agency'sair traffic specialists). Equally significant is the fact that urine drug testing of sensitive safetyemployees is to be conducted in the ``context'' of the employment relationship.As the Supreme Court has noted, ``[t]he operational realities of the workplace* * * may make <T3>some </T3>employees' expectation of privacy unreasonable.'' <T3>O'Conner v. Ortega, </T3>107 S.Ct. at 1498 (emphasis in original).This is particularly important in circumstances where the employee worksin an industry in which an employee's activities are subject to extensiveregulation. Thus, persons who work in such ``closely regulated'' industrieshave a ``reduced expectation of privacy'' [<T3>New York v. Burger, </T3>107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987)] and, ``in effect consent[] to the restrictions placed upon them'' [<T3>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </T3>413 U.S. at 271]. For thesereasons, two Federal courts of appeals have upheld urinalysis testing,in the absence of particularized suspicion, in industries where pervasiveregulation has reduced an employee's expectation of privacy. <T3>See Rushton v. Nebraska Public Power Dist., </T3>844 F.2d 562, 566(8th Cir. 1988) (nuclear plant operators); <T3>Shoemaker v. Handel, </T3>795 F.2d 1136, 1142 (3rd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>479 U.S. 986 (1986) (horse racing jockeys); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n, Local 318 v. Township of Washington,</T3>850 F.2d 133 (3rd Cir. 1988) (police officers). UMTA recognizes that a number of Federal and State courts have rejectedgovernment-mandated drug testing program on Fourth Amendment grounds. However,even courts striking drug testing programs have recognized that drug testingis appropriate in other contexts. <T3>See e.g., Lovvorn v. City of Chattanooga, </T3>1988 U.S. App. 84 F.2d1539, 1553-54 (6th Cir. 1988) (Martin, J.) panel decision vacated and rehearingen banc (August 3, 1988), (``When determining, then, whether a mandatorydrug search is `reasonable,' we believe that, as the costs to society ofan impaired employee increase, the requisite level of suspicion that adrug problem exists decreases.''); <T3>American Federation of Government Employees v. Meese, </T3>688 F. Supp.547, 548 (N.D. Cal. 1988) (issuing a preliminary injunction against a Bureauof Prison plan to test randomly all agency employees but nonetheless notingthat ``[t]here are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be justifiedin the interest of public safety or security''). Within the mass transportationindustry itself, a number of courts have reviewed service providers' drugtesting programs and, in most cases, have upheld such programs in the faceof constitutional and statutory challenges, even where such programs requireemployee testing in the absence of individualized suspicion. Thus, an earlydrug testing case upheld a drug testing program of the Chicago TransitAuthority requiring, <T3>inter alia, </T3>drug and alcohol testing of operating employees directlyinvolved in a serious accident. <T3>Division 241, Amalgamated Transit Union v. Suscy, </T3>538 F.2d 1264(7th Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>429 U.S. 1029 (1976). The Suscy court reasoned that``the public interest in the safety of mass transit riders outweighs anyindividual interest in refusing to disclose physical evidence of intoxicationor drug abuse.'' 538 F.2d at 1267. <T3>Accord Jones v. McKenzie, </T3>833 F.2d at 340 (``The case law on thispoint is clear that a governmental concern is particularly compelling whenit involves the physical safety of the employees themselves or of others.'')More recent court decisions also provide further support for the testingprograms required by this final rule. See, <T3>e.g., Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 933 v. City of Oklahoma City,</T3>No. CIV-86-2182-A (W.D. Okla. September 6, 1988) (upholding annualphysical, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, pre-employment and returnto duty from-unscheduled-absence testing of transit workers); <T3>Burka v. New York City Transit Authority, </T3>680 F. Supp. 590 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (drug testing as part of routine, periodic physical examinations;pre-employment or incident to a promotion; as a result of an on-duty incident;or based upon reasonable suspicion of impairment found not to violate RehabilitationAct and equal protection; however, disposition of Fourth Amendment issuesnot made on summary judgement); <T3>Dozier v. New York City, </T3>519 N.Y.S.2d 135, 142 (1987) (``testingapplicants for public safety-related jobs is reasonable under the FouthAmendment if the applicant is given reasonable notice of drug testing'');<T3>Transport Workers', Local 234 v. SEPTA, </T3>678 F. Supp. 543 (E.D.Pa. 1988) (upholding constitutionality of random testing of operating employees);<T3>Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1279 v. Cambria County TransitAuthority, supra, </T3>691 F. Supp. 898 (mandatory drug and alcohol testingduring annual physical examination does not violate Fourth Amendment);<T3>Shaw v. Unemployment compensation Board of Review, </T3>539 A.2d 1383(pa. 1988) (taking of bus drivers' blood and urine based on supervisor'sreasonable suspicion comports with Fourth Amendment). Cf. <T3>Sanders </T3>v. <T3>WMATA, </T3>819 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (employees' constitutionaland statutory challenge to compulsory drug test and discharge on basisof test results after on-the-job accidents or incidents were bared by doctrineof sovereign immunity). But see <T3>Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1277 v. Sunline Transit Agency, </T3>663F. Supp. 1560 (C.D. Cal. 1987) (random drug and alcohol testing of busdrivers and maintenance workers constitutes an unreasonable search). UMTA also is aware of the recent Ninth Circuit decision that held thatthe Federal Railroad Administration's mandatory blood and urine testingafter certain accidents, incidents, or rule violations is unconstitutionalbecause the rules do not require a showing of ``particularized suspicion''of drug or alcohol impairment prior to testing. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley, </T3>839 F.2d 575(9th Cir.), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S. Ct. 2033 (1988). The Ninth Circuit basedits views, in part, on the proposition that ``* * * the vast bulk of [railroad]safety regulation is directed at owners and managers of railroads, notemployees.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 585. The Supreme Court has granted a government petition for a <T3>writ of certiorari </T3>in <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Burnley </T3>and has orderedthat this case be argued this term ``in tandem'' with <T3>National Treasury Employees Union v. von Raab, </T3>816 F.2d 170 (5thCir. 1987), <T3>cert. granted, </T3>108 S. Ct. 1072 (1988) (upholding drug testingof applicants for critical safety or security sensitive positions in theU.S. Customs Service). Decisions in these cases may not be forthcominguntil the spring of 1989. However, in the absence of Supreme Court guidance,UMTA is convinced that the need for drug testing by urinalysis in the transitindustry to determine fitness for duty of sensitive safety employees and,thereby, to ensure public safety clearly outweighs the privacy interestof individuals in this class. While not totally free from doubt, it is UMTA's opinion that UMTA's anti-drugprogram, and similar drug testing regimens proposed by other administrationswithin the Department of Transportation, will be determined to be constitutional.The critical need for properly-administered drug testing to ensure thatemployees in the transportation industry do not have drugs or drug metabolitesin their system while performing sensitive safety functions outweighs thereduced privacy interest of these employees. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Statutory Basis for the Rule </ITAG>Some commenters suggest that UMTA does not have sufficient statutory authorityto issue a rulemaking that requires drug testing of employees of recipientsof UMTA funds. One recipient notes that the ``Findings and Purposes'' ofthe UMT Act (section 2) provides no specific safety statutory authority,but rather states that the purposes of the UMT Act are to (1) assist inthe development of improved mass transportation facilities, equipment,techniques and methods; (2) encourage the planning and establishment ofarea wide urban mass transportation systems needed for economical and desirableurban development; and (3) provide assistance to State and local governmentsand their instrumentalities in financing such systems. Another commenterpoints out that section 9 of the UMT Act sets forth specific provisionsof the UMT Act that apply to the section 9 formula program, but that section9(e)(1) provides that no other condition, limitation or UMT Act provisionapplies to the program. Finally, a commenter notes that section 12(d) ofthe UMT Act provides that ``[n]one of the provisions of this Act shallbe construed to authorize the Secretary to regulate in any manner the modeof operation of any mass transportation system with respect to which agrant is made under section 3 * * *,'' and concludes that this preventsUMTA from issuing this drug regulation. <T3>UMTA Response. </T3>As noted in the NPRM, the grant programs underboth section 3 and section 9 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964,as amended (The UMT Act) require a recipient of Federal financial assistanceto have the inherent capacity to carry out the purposes of the transitgrants. Under the section 3 discretionary grants program, section 3(a)(2)(A)(i)provides that ``No grant or loan shall be provided under this section unlessthe Secretary determines that the applicant has or will have_(1) the legal,financial, and technical capacity to carry out the proposed project; ** *.'' Essentially the same requirement is contained in the formula grant programunder section 9, although in the form of a certification. Section 9(e)(3)provides that each recipient of section 9 funding ``* * * should submitto the Secretary annually a certification that such recipient * * * hasor will have the legal, financial, and technical capacity to carry outthe proposed program of projects * * *''. This provision also requires,as does section 3, a certification by the recipient that it has ``satisfactorycontinuing control'' over the use of UMTA-assisted facilities and equipment.The technical capacity to carry out a mass transit project necessarilymust include an ability to provide essentially safe mass transportationservices, and it is within the scope of this requirement for UMTA to requirerecipients of sections 3 and 9 funding to undertake measures that wouldenhance their ability to provide safe operations. ``Satisfactory continuingcontrol'' also necessarily implies the ability to ensure that the safeoperation of UMTA-assisted facilities and equipment is not endangered bydrug use by employees who perform sensitive safety functions. Under the section 3 discretionary program, moreover, the Secretary is authorizedto make grants ``* * * on such terms and conditions as the Secretary mayprescribe * * *,'' providing even broader authority under this programto require a recipient to institute a drug program before a grant willbe awarded. Funds made available under 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4), moreover, essentiallyare subject to the same provisions and requirements applicable to fundsmade available under section 3. For the section 18 transportation program for non-urbanized areas, subsection18(f) provides that ``grants under this section shall be subject to suchterms and conditions (which are appropriate to the special needs of publictransportation in areas other than urbanized areas) as the Secretary mayprescribe.'' The requirements proposed here would be among the terms andconditions imposed under the authority of this section. In addition, Congress has indicated its policy that UMTA have a continuingrole in transit safety in section 22 of the UMT Act. That section providesthe Secretary (and, by delegation, UMTA) with authority to investigatecertain conditions which the Secretary believes create a serious hazardof death or injury. If the Secretary determines that such conditions docreate such a hazard, the Secretary shall require the recipient of UMTAfunding to submit a plan for correcting or eliminating such condition.The Secretary is authorized to withhold funding under the UMT Act untilthe plan is implemented. Regarding the comments raised above, we recognize the general nature ofthe ``Findings and Purposes'' section of the UMT Act as originally enacted,as well as the cited restrictions on UMTA's authority under sections 3and 9. It is important to note, however, that each time the UMT Act hasbeen amended by reauthorization legislation, UMTA generally has been givena broader mandate to administer and regulate the activities of its grantees.For example, under the most recent transit reauthorization law, the 1987Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100-17),UMTA specifically was required to issue no less than seven rulemakings.That same Act, moreover, implicitly recognizes UMTA's authority to provideguidance and oversight with respect to its grantees' activities by requiringat section 12(i) that any UMTA ``* * * statement of general or particularapplicability designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policyin carrying out provisions of this Act'' be issued as a ``rule'' subjectto notice-and-comment rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. UMTA is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the expenditure ofapproximately $3 billion annually. This final rulemaking, consistent withthe underlying statutory authority in sections 3, 9, and 18 of the UMTAct, is in furtherance of that responsibility. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Preemption of state and local law </ITAG>In the NPRM, UMTA noted that the rule would not preempt State or locallaws, and there could be instances in which a State or local agency couldface a conflict between compliance with the proposed regulation and Stateand local requirements. The comments bear this out. For example, the finalrule requires random testing. Some State or local laws apparently prohibitor limit random testing. In this situation, the UMTA rule would not preemptthe application of the State or local law; if compliance with the Stateor local law prevented the grantee from complying with the UMTA rule, however,the grantee's UMTA funding could be jeopardized. Many grantees operateunder ``consent'' statutes that permit them to take all necessary actionsto comply with Federal grant conditions. Such laws, in most cases, couldresolve the potential conflict outlined above. Not all States have such``consent'' statutes, however. In the NPRM, UMTA sought comment on whetherconflicts of this sort therefore are likely to arise and, if so, what stepsshould be taken to avoid or resolve them. A number of comments and concerns were presented on this issue, and UMTArecognizes that because the anti-drug rule does not preempt State law,conflicts may indeed occur. Accordingly, UMTA has decided to permit a recipientto seek a temporary waiver from any particular part of the rule that therecipient believes it is unable to comply with because of State or locallaw. Temporary waivers are discussed in detail elsewhere in this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Effect of rule on other federal regulations</ITAG>Commenters brought to UMTA's attention an issue we did not address in theNPRM, that certain recipients may be subject not only to UMTA's drug rulebut the related rules of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), theCoast Guard, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).More specifically, a number of recipients of UMTA funds provide commuterrail operations and, as such, are subject to FRA regulation, includingthe FRA anti-drug regulation. In addition, certain UMTA recipients operateferry boats in mass transporation service, and ferry boats are subjectto Coast Guard jurisdiction and to its anti-drug regulation.Since both the FRA's and the Coast Guard's anti-drug regulations are generallyconsistent with UMTA's, UMTA has decided to permit a recipient to certifyto UMTA that its sensitive safety employees are covered under the FRA orCoast Guard regulation. Standard certification language to this effectis included in UMTA's final regulation. Such a certification will satisfythe recipient's requirements under the UMTA drug regulation for those operationsthe Coast Guard or FRA cover. A recipient may have to submit two separatecertifications if it is subject, say, to the Coast Guard regulation withrespect to ferry boat operations but otherwise is subject to UMTA's regulationfor its bus operation. That recipient would submit a certification of compliancewith the Coast Guard rule for the ferry boat operations, and the UMTA certificationfor its other operations.The FHWA also is issuing an anti-drug rule. That rule, however, includesa governmental exemption, the effect of which is to exclude all UMTA publicbody recipients from its coverage. It is possible that the FHWA rule maycover certain private operators under contract to an UMTA recipient ifsuch operators are engaged in interstate commerce. UMTA is willing to considera request from a recipient on behalf of a private operator subject to theFHWA rule not to be subject as well to the UMTA rule, but we do not proposea blanket certification to this effect. We believe this will not be a signficantissue and would rather address it on a case-by-case basis, taking intoconsideration the compliance of the private operator with the FHWA ruleand other factors.G. Section by Section AnalysisThis final rule includes three parts: Subpart A covering general matters;Subpart B covering drug testing; and Subpart C addressing administrativeissues. Each of these Subparts is summarized below.Subpart A includes general information about the anti-drug rule. Section653.1, Purpose, describes the rule's requirement that a recipient of fundsfrom UMTA must establish an anti-drug program meeting the minimum criteriaset forth in the rule.Section 653.1(b) of this regulation provides that an employer may testthe sample obtained under this rule only for the drugs required or specificallyauthorized to be tested under this rule. That is, an employer must testthe sample for the five major drugs listed in this regulation. Only if,in the context of reasonable cause testing, UMTA authorizes testing foradditional Drug X under 49 CFR Part 40 (an approval which would be grantedonly after consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services,and only on the basis of an HHS-established testing protocol and positivethreshold) may the employer also test the sample for that drug.Absent such an approval, if the employer wants to test, in addition, forDrug Y, the employer must obtain a second sample from the employee. Theobtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of this regulation.The employer must base its request for the second sample on whatever otherlegal authority is available, since the employer cannot rely on this regulationas the basis for the request.Section 653.3, Scope, indicates that the program applies to a recipientof funds under sections 3, 9, or 18 of the UMT Act, or a recipient of interstatetransfer-transit funds under section 103(e)(4) of 23 U.S.C. In addition,if a recipient uses a public or private operator to provide mass transportationservices, this rule also affects the operator through the recipient's certificationto UMTA.Section 653.5, Definitions, defines key terms as they are used in the regulation.``Accident'' is defined as an occurrence involving a vehicle in revenueservice in which a death occurs or someone must be treated at a medicalfacility. An accident also covers a situation where property damage isestimated to be $5,000 or more or one which must be reported to the FederalHighway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, or the CoastGuard. As andSection; 653.15 makes clear, the fact that an accident has occurreddoes not itself require post-accident drug testing. Rather, the recipientmust first determine that the employee contributed to the accident or cannotcompletely be discounted as a contributing factor to the accident.Moreover, this section defines ``pass a drug test'' and points out thatthe laboratory analysis of a specimen is not the sole criterion for determiningthe presence of drugs. Rather, the medical review officer must independentlyreview those test results before a positive drug test results will be reportedto a recipient or operator.``Prohibited drug'' means marijuana; cocaine, opiates; phencyclidine (PCP),and amphetamines.``Recipient'' is defined as a direct recipient of Federal financial assistancefrom UMTA. Under the section 18 rural program, the States are the recipientsof funds from UMTA. The States generally then make the funds availableto subrecipients throughout the State. For purposes of the anti-drug regulation,the States make the certification of compliance to UMTA and may then administerthe program directly or require subrecipients separately to comply withthe regulation as a condition of receiving Federal funds through the State.In either case, UMTA will deal directly with the States regarding the regulation,not the subrecipients. A parallel approach is used with respect to anyprivate operator providing transit service under contract to a recipient.The recipient would certify its compliance with the drug regulation toUMTA, and the recipient in turn would have to make certain that the privateoperator was in compliance with the regulation.The section defines those employees of a recipient who specifically arecovered by the rule under ``sensitive safety function.'' This definitiondoes not include those who volunteer their services, a fairly common practiceamong small operators. It does cover those employees who perform dutiesrelated to the safe operation of mass transportation service in the operation,control, or maintenance functions of the system, or those who supervisesuch employees.This section defines ``small operator'' as those under the section 18 programand section 3 or section 9 recipients in urbanized areas of less than 200,000in population.Section 653.7 provides that a recipient shows compliance with the regulationby certifying to that effect to UMTA. Section 653.35 provides that thecertification must be made a year after the rule becomes final or, in thecase of small operators, a year and a half after the rule becomes final.Section 653.9 describes the required elements of a drug program. In additionto the five types of drug testing of sensitive safety employees, the programalso must include a policy statement on drug use in the workplace, andan employee education and training program.Subpart B sets out the specific requirements of a drug testing program.Section 653.11 requires a transit employer to give a drug test to an applicantit would like to hire for a sensitive safety position. This section prohibitsthe applicant from being hired for a sensitive safety position if the applicantdoes not pass the drug test. This section also applies to an employee whois being transferred to a sensitive safety position.Section 653.13 requires a transit employer to give a drug test to any sensitivesafety employee it reasonably suspects is using drugs. The section requirestwo supervisors to make the decision to test for most operators, but allowsone supervisor to make the decision for small operators. The supervisoror supervisors making the decision must be able to explain and documentthe reason for their suspicion.Section 653.15 requires a transit employer to give a drug test to any sensitivesafety employee involved in an accident unless it is clear that the employee'sperformance was not a factor in the accident. Under this section, the personmaking the decision to test could be a road supervisor or any other persondesignated by the transit employer to make it. This test must be done,that is the urine specimen must be collected, as soon as possible, butnot later than 32 hours after the accident.Section 653.17 requires a transit employer to give a number of unannounceddrug tests equal to 50 percent of its employees each year. The selectionof who is tested under this section must be made by using a scientificallyvalid random number generation method.Section 653.19 requires that if a transit employer is going to allow anemployee who refuses to take a drug test or did not pass a drug test toreturn to work in a sensitive safety position the employee must pass areturn to duty drug test. The medical review officer also must determinethat the individual may return to duty. This section would apply for example,if an employee's job was held open while the employee took part in a drugrehabilitation program. Under this section the employee also may be givenan unannounced drug test at any time during the first 60 months back onduty in a sensitive safety position.Section 653.21 requires that all drug tests given under this part complywith Department of Transportation regulations at 49 CFR Part 40. Theseregulations include requirements regarding preparation of the collectionsite, verification of the specimen collected, and proper handling of thespecimen.Section 653.23 limits the laboratory sites which may be used to performthe analysis of the specimens collected to those which are certified todo drug testing for the United States government by the Department of Healthand Human Services. Further information on certified laboratory sites maybe obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse at (301) 443-6780.Section 653.25 specifies that drug tests under this part must be evaluatedfor the presence of marijuana metabolites, cocaine metabolites, opiatemetabolites, PCP, and amphetamines. 49 CFR Part 40 sets out the levelsat which each of these drugs or their metabolites are scientifically substantialenough to indicate use of the drug. Under this section the laboratory mustfollow the testing precedures in 49 CFR Part 40, including performing aninitial screen by immunoassay and a confirmation by using gas chromatography/massspectrometry (GC/MS), and properly storing the remains of any specimenthat tests positive both times. Under this section the laboratory notifiesthe medical review officer of the results of its analysis of each specimen.Section 653.27 requires each transit employer to have a licensed physicianavailable to act as medical review officer for its anti-drug program. Themedical review officer does not need to be an employee of the transit employer;such service can be provided on a contractual basis. This section alsosets out the responsibilities of the medical review officer. Most importantly,it is the medical review officer who receives the laboratory results andmakes the determination whether an individual does not pass a drug testas defined in the rule. This determination involves not only analysis ofthe test results but includes reviewing the individual's medical informationas well. The medical review officer also determines when an employee whodid not pass a drug test or refused to take one may return to duty.Section 653.29 allows an employee who does not pass a drug test to requestadditional analysis of the urine sample the employee provided. An employeerequesting this additional analysis may be required to advance the costof the retest, but must be reimbursed if the employee passes the drug testas a result of the retest. This section does not apply to individuals whowere administered a pre-employment drug test. However, nothing in thissection prohibits a transit employer from offering this same benefit toapplicants.Subpart C sets forth a number of administrative requirements under therule, including recordkeeping and reporting requirements under andSection;653.31. A recipient is to submit a semi-annual report to UMTA on such mattersas the total number of drug tests administered by the recipient; the totalnumber of those who did not pass a drug test; and information in generalabout the program.Section 653.33 provides that individual test results may be released toa third party only upon the written consent of the individual involved,and only so long as that consent identifies the particular person to receivethe information.Section 653.35 provides three examples of a certification a recipient providesto UMTA to be in compliance with the rule. One certification relates tothose covered by the UMTA rule, while the other two cover those recipientsthat may also be subject to the Coast Guard or Federal Railroad Administrationanti-drug regulation. Coverage under either of those programs satisfiesthe UMTA regulation as well so long as the recipient certifies to UMTAit is so covered.Finally, andSection; 653.37 allows a recipient to seek a temporary waiverfrom UMTA if it believes it is unable to comply with a portion of the rule,because of State or local law. Among other things, the recipient must includea legal opinion describing the legal impediment to its compliance withthe regulation. Any temporary waiver granted by UMTA will specify whichprovision of the rule is being waived and when the expiration date of thetemporary waiver. The expiration date of a temporary waiver will be nolater than December 31, 1989.H.

Economic Analysis</ITAG>A. SummaryThe Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) has evaluated the industrycost impacts and benefits of this final rule. What follows is a summaryof a detailed economic analysis, the full text of which is available forreview in the docket to this rulemaking.The UMTA has determined that this rulemaking is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because the required anti-drug program is not likelyto have costs of over $100 million in any one year. The assumptions usedin preparing the economic impact estimates for this regulatory evaluationare based on information received from (1) public comments on the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking received during hearings or submitted in writingto the docket, (2) data on the mass transit industry included in the NationalUrban Mass Transportation Statistics Section 15 Annual Reports and otherreports, and (3) data provided by chemical testing laboratories, the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and other agencies and individuals knowledgeableabout drug abuse and chemical testing in the United States.In response to comments on the proposed rulemaking, a number of changeswhich affect the economic impact of the anti-drug program have been madein the final rule. These comments, and the responses to them, are discussedin the comments section of the preamble to the final rule.The rule is applicable to agencies which receive Federal funds from grantprograms under sections 3, 9, and 18 of the Urban Mass Transportation Actof 1964, (The UMTA Act), as amended. It is estimated that the rule initiallywill affect approximately 1,606 transit agencies and 195,500 persons insensitive safety functions.B. CostsUMTA estimates that this rule will cost $13.21 million in the first year,$13.79 million in the second year, and $14.14 million in the third andsucceeding years (in constant dollars). Costs for year one consist of $6.81million for drug testing, $3.21 million for initial program development,$2.66 million for employee/supervisor education and training, and $0.53million for program reporting to UMTA. These costs are detailed in AppendicesA and B of the Regulatory Evaluation. The first year of testing would affecta total population of approximately 195,500 persons. Random drug testingis conducted at an annual rate of 50 percent of the affected populationafter the first year. It is estimated that initial drug screening testswill cost $25.00 each and confirmation tests will cost $35.00 each. Specimencollection for testing is estimated to require 30 minutes of an employee'stime while on pay status, and an administrative cost of $35.00 is estimatedfor each test administered. Although the rule does not require rehabilitationor continued employment of persons who test positive for drugs; therefore,no costs are estimated for return to duty testing.In addition to the direct costs for testing, each transit agency will alsobear the costs for development of a drug control policy, for employee andsupervisor training, and for reporting the results of drug testing to UMTA.It is estimated that the costs for program development and policy formulationwill be $2,000 per transit agency. The final rule does not specify a minimumnumber of hours for employee and supervisor training to be conducted, exceptthat supervisors making the determination to test based on reasonable causemust receive at least 60 minutes of training. However, for purposes ofthis analysis, UMTA has calculated that each employee in a sensitive safetyposition will receive one hour of training and each supervisor will receivetwo hours of training per year. Average hourly wages for employees andsupervisors are estimated at $12.58 and $15.00, respectively. It is estimatedthat preparation of the required semi-annual and annual reports to theUMTA will require a total of 16 hours of labor at $20.00 per hour eachyear.UMTA notes that a number of commenters were concerned about the costs associatedwith labor negotiations, arbitration, litigation, or lost wages which mayresult from implementation of this rule. However, because of the uncertainnature of these actions and the varied costs that might be associated withthem, UMTA did not include any cost associated with them in this analysis.Large transit operations will have twelve months to implement their drugcontrol programs. Small entities (Section 18 funding recipients and otherentities serving urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or less) willhave 24 months for program implementation.C. Benefits UMTA believes that two major benefits will accrue from this rule. First,will be a reduction in potential fatalities, personal injuries and propertylosses resulting from accidents attributed to individuals whose judgmentor motor skills may be adversely affected by the use of illicit drugs.Second, will be the benefits accruing to recipients and operators fromthe potential reduction in absenteeism, lost productivity, medical andinsurance claim costs, and improved general safety in the workplace. Accordingto a 1987 NIDA report on Strategic Planning for Work-place Drug Abuse Programs,abusers of drugs and alcohol, in comparison to other workers, have 3.6times as many accidents, file 1.5 times as many workers' compensation claims,are absent 2.5 times more often for sick leave of 8 days or more, and incur3.0 times the normal medical costs. UMTA has been unable to quantitatively estimate the extent to which thisrule will reduce drug use in the mass transportation industry, and thuswould enhance public safety or promote transit operations as a whole. However,a number of serious transit accidents have been reported in recent yearsin which operating personnel were determined to have drugs in their systemsat the time of the accident. Analysis of the UMTA Section 15 Annual Reportfor 1985 and ``A Directory of Rural and Specialized Transit Operators,''by Rural America for UMTA dated June 1986 (Rural America Report) indicatesthat there were more than 17,300 vehicle related accidents reported involvingfatalities, injuries, or significant property damage as defined in therule. The 1985 NIDA National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports that19.3 percent of all Americans use some illicit drug in the past twelvemonths, 12.0 percent in the past 30 days. Assuming that only 10 percentof mass transit employees (as compared to 19.3 percent of the general population)use illicit drugs and that drug users are 3.6 times more likely to be involvedin accidents, it is possible to estimate that approximately 28 percentof mass transportation accidents may have been caused by persons who useillicit drugs. Thus, as many as 4,844 of the 17,300 accidents occurringin 1985 could be attributed to drug abuse. Another significant benefit of the rule, as it relates to a reduction inaccidents, is the prevention of passenger deaths and injuries. It is difficultto ascribe a dollar value to human life; however, it is obvious that transitagencies face a potential financial liability in the event of death orinjury of a passenger. For purposes of this analysis, it is estimated thatthe financial liability of a transit agency for a death to be $1 million.Because adequate data are not available upon which to base a benefit analysisdirected specifically at mass transportation, a macro approach is takento estimate benefits. A 1984 Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)study estimated the economic cost to American society from drug abuse tobe $66 billion annually. More recent reports by the National Business CrimeInformation Center and the Research Triangle Institute have estimated thiscost to society to be in excess of $100 billion annually. The estimated195,500 employees in the mass transit industry covered by this rule representapproximately eight-hundredths of one percent of the United States populationof 236 million. Thus, if drug use in the industry is assumed to be thesame as in the general population, and if this rule were 100 percent effectivein eliminating illicit drug use, the annual savings to society, based uponthe DHHS estimated national cost of $66 billion annually (the lower oftwo estimates), would be $52.8 million. This yields a benefit to cost ratioof 4.00 for year one, 3.83 for year two and 3.73 for year three. If itis assumed that a random testing rate of 50 percent of the affected populationafter year one produces a proportionate reduction in program effectiveness(i.e., to one-half) the savings to society would be $26.4 million annually.This estimate yields a benefit to cost ratio of 2.00 for year one, 1.91for year two, and 1.87 for year three and subsequent years. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Impacts </ITAG>A. Departmental Significance This rule is a ``significant regulation'' as defined by the Department'sRegulatory Policies and Procedures, because it involves important departmentalpolicy and has generated substantial public interest. This rule is one of a series of rules being issued by the Department toensure a drug free transportation system in this country. B. Executive Order 12291 This action has been reviewed under executive order 12291 and UMTA hasdetermined this is not a major rule. This rule will not result in an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more. C. Executive Order 12612_Federalism Assessment This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, concerning Federalism.UMTA has determined that this rule has sufficient Federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of this Federalism assessment. The Federalism impacts of this rulemaking result from its proposal fornew, uniform UMTA requirements that federally-assisted mass transportationproviders create and implement the drug programs described in this notice.Historically, transportation safety in the mass transit industry has notbeen the subject of specific UMTA regulatory requirements. Unlike otherDOT organizations (e.g., FAA, FHWA, Coast Guard, FRA), UMTA has never directlylicensed or regulated industry employees for safety. These matters havebeen handled locally by transit authorities. Congress has shown increasing concern about UMTA's role in transit safety,for example, in the enactment of section 22 of the UMT Act and in requiringUMTA to establish a bus testing facility by 1989. More importantly, however,the necessity of promoting safe transportation through the use of vigorousanti-drug programs designed to ensure a drug-free mass transit workplaceis national in scope and overriding in importance. This safety imperativeis the primary basis for UMTA's decision to propose a new Federal requirementwhich goes beyond the traditional relationship between UMTA, transit grantees,and their employees. The basis for imposing these requirements is the Federalfinancial assistance provided to the recipients by UMTA. It is also importantthat UMTA ensure the maximum effectiveness of its financial assistance;i.e., it must ensure that the funds are used in a safe, drug-free environment.From a national perspective, safety is important in its own right but alsoto ensure Federal funds are not wasted because of drug-related accidentsor other misuse.In considering the Federalism impacts of this proposal, UMTA has focusedon several key provisions of Executive Order 12612.  andbullet; Necessity for action. As noted above, there is an overriding safetynecessity to insure a drug-free transportation workplace. Passengers onbus, rail, and other mass transportation systems must be ensured that vehicleoperators and others whose actions are important to passenger safety donot use illegal drugs and that recipients have the legal, technical andfinancial capability to provide safe transportation service. In the absenceof an UMTA requirement for an anti-drug program, which will identify drugusers, deter drug use, and may provide opportunities for rehabilitation,this assurance cannot be made.  andbullet; Consultation with State and local governments. UMTA's regulatedparties are primarily State and local government agencies (e.g., Statedepartments of transportation, local transit authorities). Consequently,the views of affected State and local agencies were or particular importanceto UMTA in this rulemaking. To ensure that these State and local governmentswere made aware of this rulemaking, UMTA held four public hearings on it. andbullet; National scope of the problem. As noted elsewhere, the countryhas a nationwide, pervasive drug problem. There is no community in thecountry that is not affected, actually or potentially, by this problem.Mass transit users in every community need the same assurance that theirsafety will not be compromised by drug use by sensitive safety transitemployees. They also need assurance that their tax dollar used in Federalassistance are not wasted because of drug-related accidents.  andbullet; Need for uniform, national standards. Only with uniform minimumnational standards in this area can the safety concerns of passengers andthe privacy and reliability concerns of employees be resolved in a waythat addresses the national drug problems we face. State and local agenciesare free to tailor the basic program requirements to meet their needs.Federal intrusion into local implementation decisions will be minimizedthrough the use of self-certification by grantees of their compliance withUMTA requirements.  andbullet; Authority. The statutory authority for this rule is discussedelsewhere in this preamble. As a statutory and constitutional matter, theauthority of Federal agencies to impose reasonable and necessary conditionson the receipt of Federal financial assistance is well established.  andbullet; Preemption. This final rule does not, as such, preempt State oflocal law. However, there will be a few instances in which a State or localagency faces a conflict between compliance with the regulation and Stateand local requirements. This rule has a provision for a temporary waiverin such cases which is discussed elsewhere in this preamble.  D. Regulatory Flexibility Act  In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as added by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, Pub. L. 96-354, UMTA certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  In this rule, UMTA has defined a small entity to be any transit agencywhich receives funding under Section 18 of the UMT Act, as amended, orwhich serves an urbanized area of 200,000 persons or less. This rule doesnot cover transit operations receiving assistance under section 16(b)(2)of the UMT Act.  The wide range of agency sizes, modes of operation, and geographical locationswithin this classification makes it difficult to determine the actual economicimpact of this rulemaking. However, a number of the smaller transit agenciesthat already have drug testing programs in place commented that implementingthe requirements of the rule, to include random testing, would have minimalfinancial impact. Additionally, a large number of the smaller transit agenciesare those which receive Section 18 funding and some of these use unpaidvolunteers who are not covered by the rule. Considering these factors andthe benefits which accrue to transit entities from increased productivityand potential reductions in medical and insurance costs as a result ofthe implementation of the proposed drug control program. It is believedthat this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on smallagencies.  E. Paperwork Reduction Act  The collection of information requirements in this rule are subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act, Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. Theserequirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review. Information will not be collected under this rule until OMBclearance is received and the OMB clearance number is published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 653  </ITAG>Drug testing, Grant programs_transportation, Mass transportation.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
