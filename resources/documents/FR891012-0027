This revisionto the rule removes the voluntary aspect of metric transition for Federalagencies, as mandated by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988(Pub. L. 100-418, sec. 5164).  The policy set out below was stated in a prior notice: ``Metric ConversionPolicy for Federal Agencies,'' 50 FR 27577, July 5, 1985. The basic statementof policy has been taken directly from the prior notice. However, thisproposed rule amends the earlier policy to bring the references and textup-to-date. The policy clarifies and strengthens Federal program requirements.Implementing agency initiatives are expected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Commments should be submitted on or before November 13,1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments should be sent to the U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Metric Programs Office, Room 4841, Washington, DC 20230.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>G.T.

L. 100-418, 5164)declares the metric system to be the ``preferred measurement system forU.S. trade and commerce.'' Federal agencies are also now required to usethe metric system in procurement, grants and other business-related activities,by a date certain and to the extent economically feasible by the end offiscal year 1992. These vital declarations and the accompanying reportof the Congressional conferees require this updating of the existing Federalpolicy document.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirement  </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291 the Department must judge whether a regulationis major within the meaning of section 1 of the Order and, therefore, subjectto the requirement that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be prepared. Thispolicy statement is not a major rule because it is not likely to resultin (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more; (2) a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or in the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Therefore, a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis will not be prepared.  These proposed guidelines do not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.  This action is exempt from the analysis requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act because notice and opportunity for comment are not requiredfor this policy statement by section 553 of the Administrative ProcedureAct of any other law. Therefore, no initial or final regulatory flexibilityanalysis will be prepared.  This policy statement does not contain a collection of information forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 19  </ITAG>Science and technology; Metric system.

Such criteria should appropriately weigh both agency costsand national economic benefits related to changing to the use of metric;(f) Provide for full public involvement and timely information about significantmetrication policies, programs and actions;(g) Seek out ways to increase understanding of the metric system of measurementthrough educational information and guidance and in agency publications;(h) Consider particularly the effects of agency metric policies and practiceson small business; and(i) Consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations System (48 CFR),accept, without prejudice, metric goods and services when they are offeredat competitive cost and meet the needs of the Government.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 19.24</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Recommendations for agency organization.</ITAG>Each agency shall:(a) Participate, as appropriate, in the Interagency Committee on MetricPolicy (ICMP), and/or its working committee the Metrication Operating Committee(MOC) in coordinating and providing policy guidance for the U.S. Government'stransition to use of the metric system.(b) Designate a senior official to be responsible for agency metric policyand to represent the agency on the ICMP.(c) Designate an appropriate official to represent the agency on the MetricationOperating Committee (MOC), an interagency committee reporting to the ICMP.(d) Maintain liaison with private sector groups (such as the American NationalMetric Council and the U.S. Metric Association) that are involved in planningfor or coordinating National use of the metric system.(e) Provide for internal guidelines, training and documentation to assureemployee awareness and understanding of agency metric policies and programs.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee W.
