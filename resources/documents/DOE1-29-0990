A natural evolutionof these systems, taking advantage of the independent nature of &quot;events&quot;,is to use identical parallel microcomputers in a front end to simultaneouslyanalyze separate events. Such a system has been developed at Argonneto serve the needs of the experimental program of ATLAS, a new superconductingheavy-ion accelerator and other on-going research. Using microcomputersbased on the National Semiconductor 32016 microprocessor housed in aMultibus I cage, CPU power equivalent to several VAXs is obtained ata fraction of the cost of one VAX. The front end interfaces to a VAX11/750 on which an extensive user friendly command language based onDCL resides. The whole system, known as DAPHNE, also provides the meansto replay data using the same command language. Design concepts, datastructures, performance, and experience to date are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
