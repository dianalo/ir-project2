<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0858 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of engine types are continually considered for military vehicleapplication; however, their current engine thrusts are concentrated withinthe advanced diesel and gas turbine areas. In addition, other promisinggovernment and industrial programs which address advanced engine systemswith relevance to military vehicles are closely monitored by the Army.Because of the established thrusts of this conference, emphasis duringthis briefing is applied to advanced diesel engine technology. Havingbeen pioneered by TACOM, low heat rejection adiabatic type engines forma critical building block for future military propulsion systems overa wide range of power levels and vehicle applications. Examples of past,present, and projected work in the adiabatic diesel area by TACOM iscovered. Representative examples of current activities in this area include:(1) a 600 hp engine demonstrator for possible M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicleuse, (2) an early adiabatic technology spinoff for application withinthe M109 Howitzer vehicle, (3) evaluation of low heat rejection technologyfor military truck application, and (4) developments for applicationto future classes of main battle tanks. Technology barriers in the areasof (1) high temperature tribology, (2) insulated materials, with emphasison technology voids in the advanced coating area, and (3) designing withceramic materials from performance and stress limitation standpointsare particularly critical. Future advances in the adiabatic diesel enginearea are directly tied to removing these types of technical barriers.Discussion of goals and current efforts in these areas are covered.</TEXT></DOC>
