That means just one appeal must be reviewed by the court beforeManville can implement the plan.   ``Obviously we're pleased, because it means that we're just onestep closer to emerging from Chapter 11 and being able to operateas a normal company again,'' said Manville spokesman David Samson.   ``It also means we're just one step closer to the point wherethe (Personal Injury Settlement) Trust can be activated andasbestos health claimants can begin to be compensated,'' he said.   Manville filed for bankruptcy protection six years ago, on Aug.26, 1982, when more than 400 asbestos-related lawsuits were beingfiled against the company each month.   A proposed reorganization plan was confirmed by the BankruptcyCourt for the Southern District of New York in December 1986, butit cannot be consummated until all appeals are exhausted.   The plan created the personal injury trust as well as a PropertyDamage Trust to settle asbestos-related claims. It also devised aschedule for paying secured and unsecured creditors.   A group of about 700 asbestos health claimants had challengedparts of the plan that prevent payment of punitive damages toasbestos claimants and that require lawsuits for asbestos injuriesto be filed against the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trustrather than Manville Corp., the company said.   The appeal was turned down by the New York bankruptcy court,U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals. Manvilleofficials said the group failed to petition the Supreme Court for areview of the plan by the deadline at midnight Thursday.   Earlier this summer, MacArthur Co. and Western MacArthur Co., aMinneapolis-based building materials distributor, petitioned theSupreme Court for a review of the bankruptcy court's approval ofmore than $700 million in settlements negotiated between Manvilleand 29 insurance carriers.   The Supreme Court has not acted yet on MacArthur's petition.</TEXT></DOC>
