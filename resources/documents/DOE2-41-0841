Forecasts of regional loadare presented and a series of expansion plans are presented based onthis forecast. These plans assume the use of technologies appropriateto the year in which units are added to the system: circulating fluidizedbed units in the 1990s and coal gasificiation combined cycle units after2000. Capital costs and coal requirements are calculated for cases involvingvarious sulfur dioxide emission targets. A review of these cases indicatesthat, given emission targets that can reasonably be met by the utilities,given an attractive price for coal and a reasonable capital cost forpollution control technologies, the market potential for coal in thisregion for electricity production can reach over 10 million metric tonnes/yby 2012. As for exports, given the projected power deficiencies in NewEngland (even taking into account imports to that region from Quebec),and assuming strong regional cooperation and an attractively priced coalsupply, it is felt that exports to that region of up to 2,000 MW canbe achieved by 2000. In addition, there is the possibility of 500-1,000MW additional needed coal-fired generation capacity in Newfoundland by2000, and a similar amount in the Gaspe area of Quebec. 4 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
