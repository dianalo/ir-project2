The court endorsed a district court ruling in March that rejected claims that the Interior Department had violated federal environmental law in preparing the sale. The lower court had enjoined the effect of its decision, pending the appeal, but the appeals court dissolved the injunction.    The decision frees Interior officials to formally open oil company bids to lease up to 5.6 million acres in a salmon-rich area near the Bering Sea. The government solicited bids for the sale in January 1986 but until now has been barred by court order from opening them. Officials said the bids would be opened in Anchorage, Alaska, Tuesday.    The decision brought predictable praise from government and oil company attorneys and a vow from environmentalists, who sided in the case with the state of Alaska and others, to continue the fight in court. The Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the opponents, said it would ask the appeals court for an emergency order today to block Tuesday's sale.    A government lawyer said he thought it possible that seismic testing in the region could begin before winter. Harsh weather conditions and the need to obtain further government approvals make actual drilling unlikely until at least next year.    The sale could also be complicated by the recent plunge in oil prices. Oil companies are permitted to withdraw their bids until just before they are opened, and some might choose to do so, considering sinking prices. Exxon Corp. has already pulled out of the bidding. The government lawyer, however, predicted a &quot;pretty big sale.&quot;    The sale has been opposed on the ground that it would irreparably harm Bristol Bay's $1 billion-a-year salmon industry and its rich marine estuaries. Opponents had claimed that federal officials hadn't adequately studied the impact of oil drilling on the subsistence hunting and fishing rights of Bristol Bay's Eskimos, as required by federal law.    &quot;This fight is far from over,&quot; said Lisa Speer, a scientist with the natural resources group in New York, who called Bristol Bay the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the government's outer-continental shelf leasing program.    In its decision, the appeals court relied heavily on a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision that frowns on &quot;premature litigation&quot; about the environmental consequences of actual drilling. The court held that proceeding with the lease sale and other preliminary drilling activities would make more data available for evaluating potential environmental risks.    &quot;As no danger to the environment stems from the lease sale stage, the public interest in favor of developing oil and gas reserves also weighs on the side of lifting the injunction,&quot; the court held. </TEXT></DOC>
