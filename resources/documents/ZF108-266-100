 The pressure toachieve those objectives will be felt strongly by managers of informationtechnology, whose systems will carry out the ends needed by corporations,agencies and institutions of all kinds.andM;Information systems executives are responding to such pressure in a varietyof ways, as we've seen in previous reports in Systems and Strategies, acontinuing series in DATAMATION this year.andP;  They are focusing more intentlyon applications.andP;  They are building electronic hierarchies to organise theircompanies.andP;  They are distributing their computer power out to where it can bebest applied via networked client/server systems.andP;  Perhaps the mostinnovative and profound way, however, is to make their own IS organizationsmore efficient by increasing their reliance on outside IS serviceproviders--both for professional needs such as programming and forinformation needs such as databases.andM;Managing these IS resources, external as they may be, will become animportant task for top IS professionals in this decade.andP;  To take advantage ofsuch resources, chief information officers, network managers--virtuallyeveryb ody in IS organizations--must:andM;* Understand when going outside helps.andP;  If IS managers are under pressure toreduce costs, or if they face critical IS talent shortages, they probablyshould be seeking help from service suppliers.andM;* Examine where IS employees are spending their time.andP;  IF they are relyingmore on outside service suppliers, they probably should be spending fewerhours at internal staff meetings and more hours visiting and conferring withthe professional and information services providers.andM;* Focus their internal IS resources on critical projects.andP;  IS employees canfeel threatened when their departments decide to outsource.andP;  Managers canminimize bad feelings by maximizing employees' participation in projectscritical to the way their organizations will compute in the 1990s, such aslocal area networking implementation.andM;* Measure, maintain and improve IS quality and responsiveness.andP;  If ISdepartments want to continue to serve the information needs of theircustomers--i.e., end users--they should ensure that the services rendered endusers do not suffer when the services are shifted to outside suppliers.andO;Issues such as interfaces, quality of data and support are critical.andM;The trend among medium and large user organizations to depend more on outsideIS services is unmistakable and, to a degree, unavoidable.andM;Users worldwide are expected to more than double their already hefty spendingon professional IS services by middecade from $101 billion in 1989 to $242billion in 1994, according to Input Inc., a market research firm in MountainView, Calif.andP;  The firm's definition of such services--which are increasinglycoming under the umbrella term of &quot;outsourcing&quot;--covers processing services,network services, turnkey systems, systems integration and other functions.andM;The need for outside information services stands to grow from $19.7 billionin 1988 to $32.5 billion in 1993, estimates Veronis, Suhler andamp; Associates Inc.andO;The New York City investment banking firm categorizes information servicesinto marketing, economic/financial, credit, payroll/human resource,product/price, legal/regulatory, scientific/technical and general businessdata.andM;What's causing such demand is hardly a secret.andP;  Affecting IS operations arethe same forces shaping every other business decision in this last milebefore the new millennium.andP;  Global competition, shareholder pressure andhuman skills shortages, among other forces, are leading the '90s corporationto seek out expertise of all types.andP;  If a commercial systems integrator cantie corporate systems together better than an in-house systems integrationstaff, so be it.andP;  Outsource!andP;  If a database vendor can collect more accuratemarketing information on a corporation's products, so be it.andP;  Access!andM;The Ins of OutsourcingandM;What really lies behind and beyond such calls for IS action?andP;  Here are thelessons of a few users that have chosen to rely more on outside professionalsto do their computing, as well as the thoughts of some leadin experts as towhat's causing them to behave this way.andP;  Later on, you'll find out why usersare building conduits of information into their organizations from outsidereservoirs of marketing and other vital data.andM;Outsourcing, a term that came into vogue is IS circles in the late 1980s, isgeneral by definition but specific by application.andP;  It describes a variety ofservices, everything from outright facilities management to contractprogramming, from network management to systems integration.andP;  But it alsomust be applied on a case-by-case basis--that is, it's not for everybody.andM;In fact, DATAMATION's own 1989/1990 IS budget survey, which will be detailedin our April 1, 1990 issue, reveals that the average IS executive this yearis budgeting only 12.6% of resources for outside IS services.andM;There is mounting anecdotal evidence, however, showing that users in the '90swill be moving specific pieces of the IS function outside.andP;  Some see a chanceto free up IS resources from central, hadquarter-type functions todistributed line applications.andP;  Dial Corp., for example, six weeks agoannounced its decision to outsource most of its mainframe processing toAndersen Consulting.andP;  The Phoenix-based company, a subsidiary of GreyhoundCorp., gave Andersen the big iron tasks in order to concentrate its ISresources on building a distributed network of midrange systems to supportits personal-care and household-goods operations.andM;David McKay expects to see a lot of companies take this approach in the1990s.andP;  The director of resource operations at Lexington, Mass., consultingfirm Nolan, Norton andamp; Co. says, &quot;The way technology will be used will bedifferent in the future.andP;  Instead of functional organizations, companies willbe more oriented around their business units.&quot;andM;Patrick Gross, vice chairman of American Management Systems Inc., confirmsthis trend among his systems integration customers.andP;  &quot;Bottom-line seniorexecutives who are mor knowledgeable and more involved in business objectivesare driving the outside services trend,&quot; says Gross, whose Arlington, Va.,andO;company has grown to $213 million as a result.andP;  &quot;They are thinking, 'I willtrade total control [of a specific project] for greater impact on mybusiness.'&quot;andM;The Programming PayoffandM;One user organization that's already seen the impact of outsourcing on itsperformance is Great American Bank SSB of San Diego.andP;  Six or seven years ago,the bank's programming staff was struggling to meet the demands of its endusers.andP;  So is shifted responsibility for programming to an outside firm,which went out of its way to seek input from Great American's end users toestablish programming priorities.andM;Great American replaced all of its internally developed software withcommercially available banking packages from Systematics Inc. of Little Rock,Ark.andP;  The bank's contract with Systematics calls for the firm to install,customize and maintain those applications.andP;  As a result, Great American hasbeen able to reduce its programming staff from 85 to 51.andP;  &quot;We just could notafford to develop our own applications,&quot; explains Tom Lester, first vicepresident and manager of Great American's IS division in San Diego.andP;  &quot;When wehad our own systems programming staff, they were always fighting with theusers for staff resources.andP;  Now those choices and decisions are made by theusers themselves.andM;Another San Diego user organization, Foodmaker Inc., has pursued outsourcingnot so much to redistribute resources as to reduce costs.andP;  Consequently ithas pursued a slightly different IS outsourcing path: taking the processingroute rather than the programming road.andP;  The fast-food chain operator isbuying raw computing power from Litton Computer Services--a choice it madesome five years ago.andP;  At the time, recalls Foodmaker IS vice president TerryBabbit, the company was in the midst of a leveraged buyout, limiting what thecompany could spend on internal IS operations.andP;  Nevertheless, it also hadgrown so fast that it needed to develop its own data center.andM;Foodmaker opted to farm out its mainframe operations to Mountain View,Calif-based Litton.andP;  &quot;It required no capital investment and was costeffective,&quot; Babbitt says, revealing that IS costs are down 15% as a result.andO;The deal also entailed little risk that Foodmaker would lose control over itsIS destiny.andP;  To this day, it has complete freedom to manipulate its owndata--even though they reside on Litton's machines.andM;The outsourcing deal has another big benefit.andP;  Foodmaker can spend its ISdollars elsewhere.andP;  For example, it's currently installing 386-based PCs inthe back offices of each of its 600 company-owned Jack-in-the-Boxrestaurants.andP;  The PCs feed data to Foodmaker's own minicomputers, which inturn send information to Litton's mainframes.andM;Like Great American and Foodmaker, most user organizations that rely on ISoutsourcing do not relinquish all of their IS operations to suppliers.andP;  To doso, say some executives, is a big risk--one that's difficult to justifytaking up front.andP;  Not even Eastman Kodak co., the most notable example of acorporation that's decided to outsource much of its IS operations, has handedover all of its IS takes tasks to its chief outsourcing suppliers, IBM andDigital Equipment Corp. IBM will run Kodak's data center operations, whileIBM and Digital share management of its network.andP;  Kodak is going to focus itsIS energies on building distributed applications within its business units.andM;The Right Approach to OutsourcingandM;But visible moves, like the film giant's, put increased pressure on othercorporations to explore the option of outsourcing--if not everything, then atleast pieces of their IS operations.andP;  &quot;Primarily, financial pressures areforcing them [publicly held companies like Kodak] to focus on what they dowell,&quot; says Edward Choate, a consultant for Arthur D. Little Inc. inCambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;In light, of that, companies are taking a look at eachfunction of IS before deciding to outsource piecemeal.&quot;andM;For TRW Inc. the piece of the IS picture that's going to be left out will bemainframes.andP;  TRW has set its sights on moving away from host-based computingon mainframe systems to a client/server model that uses IBM PS/2s and AppleMacintoshes as workstations and Digital MicroVAXs as servers.andP;  &quot;Obviously[our] well-trained technical people see the end of their career ladder as wephase out mainframes,&quot; says Bill Nelson, director of technology managementfor TRW's Corporate Information Resources.andP;  During the phasing out of thosesystems, TRW will need outside sources of maintenance support if itsmainframe technical talent flees or needs to work on other types of systemsat TRW.andM;In TRW's new vision, end users will become much more self-sufficient.andP;  &quot;Ourthrust is to try to change the information technology such that the end userhas control of his own destiny and is the really proactive in the developmentof his [own] applications,&quot; Nelson explains.andP;  At some point, he adds,mainframe applications that cannot migrate to PCs are likely to be outsourceto third parties.andP;  Currently, the Cleveland-based company's automotive andcorporate divivions, under strict order to hold down employee headcounts, aregoing outside for contract programming on special projects.andP;  About 10% of theIs work load in those divisions is now performed by outsiders.andM;Not all of those who are outsourcing are entirely enthusiastic.andP;  Right now,for example, Gillette co. believes most IS functions are best kept inside therazor kingdom.andP;  &quot;The real issue [for Gillette] comes down to whether we cando it better in house,&quot; says Ted Standish, director of information resourcesfor Gillette's North Atlantic Shaving andamp; Personal Care Group Boston.andP;  That'swhere the company's main data-processing center is located.andP;  Nevertheless,Gillette does intend to make greater use of IS outsourcing services, notablycontract programming and facilities management in the United States andEurope.andP;  Most of its outsourcing will occur from its smaller remote sites,where there may not be enough work to keep in-house staff occupied.andM;However, for the most part Gillette is comfortable handling those IS choreson its own.andP;  &quot;We're where we want to be,&quot; Standish says, explaining thatmaintenance will always be an issue in deciding whether to go outside forthings like contract programming.andM;&quot;We have an application that's very important to our operation that waswritten several years ago,&quot; he says, by way of an example.andP;  &quot;The software itwas written with no longer exists, so we have to hunt up the last known guyfamiliar with the application when things go wrong.&quot;andP;  Standish adds thatGillete now buys a lot of applications packages off the shelf instead ofstarting from scratch.andP;  &quot;We develop applications from scratch only for thingsthat are unique to our business or to our company.&quot;andM;Another user, Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., a superregional bankheadquartered in Providence, R.I., seems to be hesitantly testing theoutsourcing waters.andP;  The banking group's use of outsiders is limited tothings like processing credit card applications, although it may expand totrust processing.andM;&quot;Obviously, we must be given assurances that we will have [some] control oflevel of service,&quot; says Michael Zucchini, Fleet/Norstar chief informationofficer.andP;  He doesn't expect outsourcing to be a new wave at Norstar becauseas he puts it, &quot;We believe we can do it as well as anyone else.andP;  Our dataprocessors are good business people.&quot;andM;The one-IS-step-at-a-time approach to IS outsourcing may, however, give wayto an all out rush.andP;  &quot;Systems management is the business of the 1990s,&quot;asserts John Oltman, a managing partner with Andersen Consulting's worldwideintegration services.andP;  The firm's view of systems management extends beyondfacilities management, a term that simply describes the maintenance ofcomputer processing and networks, to include software renewal andenhancement.andM;&quot;We think the best answer [may be] joint ventures for delivering ITsolutions,&quot; Oltman says.andP;  User organizations and integrators such as AndersenConsulting are likely to be entering arrangements in which both share therisks and the rewards of codeveloping systems.andP;  The shared approach will mostlikely be pursued in cases where user organizations are radically changingtheir approaches to particular areas of business.andM;When Sharing Makes SenseandM;Shared development may be the most effective way to win favorable judgment,believes Barry Sullivan, director of corporate marketing for Electronic DataSystems Corp. of Dallas.andP;  &quot;Large from-the-ground-up systems developmentexercises are going to be rarer and rarer,&quot; he predicts.andP;  Instead, he seesusers and integrators collaborating to build systems out of customizablecomponents.andM;Sharing is very much part of the IS culture at Royal Bank of Canada.andP;  TheMontreal-based bank, Canada's largest, is working with a softwareapplications developer to create a program that would allow the bank's endusers to extract information via PCs from any centrally located or remotedatabase.andP;  The application itself belongs to the developer, which the banksays it can't identify yet for contractual reasons.andP;  Part of that contractcalls for the developer to maintain the application for the bank; anotherpart allows the developer to sell the program to other user organizations.andM;Royal Bank's return on the shared project is considerable.andP;  Beyond the costsavings realized by sharing development expenses, the bank requires far fewerIS staffers (if any) to maintain the program.andP;  &quot;The long-term benefit is[that] over 70% of my staff is now freed up to develop new technology and newapplications,&quot; says James Grant, executive vice president of systems andtechnology of Royal Bank.andM;Technology itself will play a key role in accelerating the trend towardoutsourcing IS services.andP;  Advances in networking, for example, alloworganizations to outsource more processing without disruption to end users.andO;Furthermore, the specialized knowledge required to take advantage oftechnology will lead organizations to search for the best economic terms forobtaining such knowledge--a search that frequently leads them outside.andM;The danger, of course, is loss of control, but the reward, flexibility, maybe worth it.andP;  &quot;If the technology issues are really highly strategic to you,you have to be careful,&quot; cautions Nolan, Norton's McKay.andP;  &quot;You could give upa level [degree] of flexibility by using an outside vendor.andP;  It's one of thebig tradeoffs.&quot;andM;The Competitive Value of InformationandM;Although many IS organizations have had no direct experience with outsourcingprofessional aspects of their IS perations, few have escaped the need to lookoutside for information critical to their companies.andP;  More than 4,000commercial databases already exist to provide such information--a numberexpected to grow during this decade as access to reliable information becomesan increasingly important competitive tool.andM;&quot;We see a gradual trend to expanding the external supply of informationrelied on by corporate IS,&quot; says Arthur D. Little's Choate.andP;  &quot;The informationis being used for strategic and planning areas and not as it once was foroperations and control.&quot;andP;  Two things that will enable IS executives todeliver such information, he adds, are better filtering applications andexpert systems.andP;  The former will create manageable amounts of information;the latter will link together abstract relationships among data.andM;A challenge for IS executives, then, is to merge outside information withinside information to create a database of knowledge from which managers candraw to make decisions they otherwise could not make.andM;External database information can be grouped into any of a half dozen or sooverlapping categories.andP;  Those include analytical economic and financialinformation; business information (for credit risk models, financialanalysis, strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions and cash flowmanagement); legal and regulatory information; medical, scientific andtechnical resources; marketing information (analytical data for competitiveanalysis); and business industry news (such as the Dow Jones News/Retrievalservice).andM;Hands down, marketing research constitutes the most popular and sought afterdata.andP;  Veronis, Suhler andamp; Associates predicts that corporations will continueto spend twice as much for marketing information as they do for the nextsingle biggest category, economic and financial data.andP;  The investment bankingfirm estimates that companies bought nearly $7 billion worth of marketingdata in 1988--representing 35% of total corporate outlays for informationservices that year.andP;  Spending for economic and financial data accounted foralmost 18%, or $3.5 billion, of the $19.7 billion allocated to such servicesin 1988.andP;  The total market in 1993 is predicted to reach $32.5 billion.andM;Fueling the sort of growth expected by Veronis, Suhler are structural changestaking place in user organizations.andP;  Kodak, which is striving to become asdecentralized as possible, again provides an excellent example.andO;&quot;Historically, we looked inside for information in planning for the future,&quot;says Roy Holmes, associate director of corporate IS at Kodak.andP;  Holmesestimates that as much as 90% of such information used to come from insidethe Rochester, N.Y., company's various divisions.andM;&quot;As the business units get up to speed, they will find more and more need forinformation about products and competitors.andP;  The bulk of that will come fromexternal sources,&quot; Holmes predicts.andP;  Within 10 years, he says, Kodak could beobtaining 90% of its information outside.andP;  For the moment, its use ofexternal database information is limited mostly to Mead Data Central's Lexis(legal) and Nexis (news and business) services.andM;The Cost of InformationandM;For other users, the cost of information is nearly as important as thequality and timeliness of it.andP;  &quot;At what price can the [external] informationbe obtained is always an issue,&quot; says Mark Barmann, executive vice presidentand chief information officer of Charles Schwab andamp; Co. Inc. of San Francisco.andO;&quot;The economics of obtaining the data are not always easy to see.&quot;andM;The extent of Schwab's use of external data may come into sharper focus asthe firm implements its new distributed-computing plan for the '90s.andP;  Schwabplans to disperse real-time information over an enterprisewide network.andP;  Theplan, dubbed Schwab's Architecture andamp; Migration Strategy, will move the firmaway from a single-node, classified mainframe hierarchy.andM;Like Kodak, Ford Motor Co. is another example of a nonfinancial corporationwith a huge investment in and commitment to both external informationservices and internal data.andP;  Ford combines external data with its owninformation to offer an on-line information service.andP;  The service comprises24 separate databases for some 4,000 of the company's end users.andP;  Most userstoday are Ford product engineers and product planners; fewer than 20% comefrom the manufacturing ranks.andP;  More factory end users are expected to use theservice, however, as Ford adds more manufacturing database information.andM;&quot;We buy data from Europe, U.S.andP;  and Japan.andP;  For data we cannot buy, we do itourselves, working with a vendor,&quot; says Rick Linder, who manages Ford'sCorporate Technical Information System (CTIS).andM;Justifying the cost and quantifying the benefits of information is alwaystough, Linder says.andP;  &quot;We don't sell data by the pound.&quot;andP;  Still, he says,&quot;even though you cannot put a value on it, management recognizes the wisdom ofusing and storing information everyone can use.andP;  Justification comes in theform of the time users say CTIS saves them.&quot;andM;The databases contain gigabytes of information on the automotive industry,including news files, technical files, vehicle specifications.andP;  The bulk ofthe external data is acquired from the Society of Manufacturing Engineers(SME) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).andP;  Linder maintains,however, that one of the major benefits of CTIS, which went on line some fourand one-half years ago, is to avoid overloading workers with information.andM;But, he cautions, &quot;it's like walking into a big library.andP;  You have to knowwhat you're after, organize your search strategy and then execute the search.andO;Having the data on a mainframe requires the same thought process.andP;  Benefitsinclude the ability to do a search and [having] a library that's as close asthe keyboard on your desktop machine.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
