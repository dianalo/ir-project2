(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A cold snap that damaged tender orange andgrapefruit blooms last winter may set back the citrus industry'srecovery from tree-killing freezes in the mid 1980s, agricultureofficials said.   State forecasters Thursday estimated Florida will harvest 130million boxes of oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit thisseason. It would be the smallest orange crop in three years and thesmallest grapefruit crop in five years.   The drop is attributed to a three-day dip in temperatures thathurt blooms last February but did not damage fruit on the trees.   ``The good news is that the trees themselves were not damaged bythe cold,'' said Harry Whittaker, citrus statistician with theFlorida Agricultural Statistics Service in Orlando. ``So if we getthrough this winter, we should have a good crop next year.''   During the season that ended in July, Florida harvested 146.6million boxes of oranges and 54.8 million boxes of grapefruit worthan estimated $1.41 billion. A record $1.44 billion citrus crop washarvested the previous season.   The joint state and federal crop reporting service uses acombination of surveys and computer models to make the cropforecasts.   Major freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed about 200,000 acres oftrees, most in Central Florida.   ``I personally thought it would be a few more boxes, but it's agood estimate on both oranges and grapefruit,'' said BillYoungblood, an Orange County citrus grower and processor. ``It'sgood for prices, particularly on grapefruit.''   Although smaller crops generally increase prices, a recordorange crop in Brazil estimated at 300 million boxes could keepdomestic juice prices down, officials said. More than 90 percent ofFlorida's orange crop is converted to juice.   John Jackson, citrus specialist with the Lake CountyAgricultural Extension Service, said the orange forecast was atleast 20 million boxes smaller than he was anticipating.   ``I wouldn't second-guess them,'' Jackson told The OrlandoSentinel. ``Based on their track record and their computer models,they're generally pretty accurate.''   The smaller orange crop means that the state should produceabout 149.8 million gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice,down from 175 million gallons in 1988-1989, according to estimatesby the Lakeland-based Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largestgrowers' organization.   ``If we escape this season with no serious freezes in the citrusbelt, the 1990-91 crop should be the best we've had in manyyears,'' said Bobby McKown, Mutual's executive vice president.   The Florida Department of Citrus, a state agency that promotesthe industry with money collected from grower fees, also may haveto cut its $72.4 million budget as a result of the smaller crop,said spokeswoman Cathy Clay.   ``We're a little disappointed in the crop sizes, but we haveevery confidence that the industry is still on the road to recoveryfrom the earlier freezes,'' Ms. Clay said.   A box of oranges weighs 90 pounds, and a box of grapefruit is 85pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
