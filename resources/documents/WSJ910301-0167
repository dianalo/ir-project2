The alliedmen and women of the Bush coalition had just defeated one ofthe world's largest armies, while only 126 of their owntroops had died in combat as of yesterday. If the end camequickly for Saddam's huge military machine, it was becausesomething large was leaning on it.   Saddam's men buckled under the weight of a decade's worthof military development and production. They buckled beneath20 years of effort by U.S. military officers to create asuccessful army. They collapsed beneath the burden of ahalf-million troops who both mastered history's mostsophisticated weapons and learned its oldest lessons ofmilitary discipline. Finally, Saddam's army took on anAmerican President who knew what he was doing and an Americanpublic that liked what their country was doing -- and saidso.</LP><TEXT>   It is also important that no currency be given to thenotion that this was an &quot;easy&quot; victory. We are not referringto the arguments one might get on this point from the pilotsand crews who flew nearly 100,000 sorties before the groundwar began, breaking down the enemy's will to fight. What wehave in mind is the sustained effort that brought the U.S.defense structure to this high level: the nonstop politicalbattles fought on Capitol Hill and inside the bureaucracy toprotect worthy weapons systems (such as then-Senator DanQuayle's single-minded effort to save the Patriot); thesuccessful molding of a skilled all-volunteer army that, yes,attracted many black Americans who now come home to glory andhonor; the senior officers, like Colin Powell and NormanSchwarzkopf, who in return for the spit they got afterVietnam, stayed on to rebuild a better army. In short, rumorsto the contrary the past 10 years, we now see that somebodydid something right. That is why it was easy.   Toward the end of his briefing jihad Wednesday, GeneralSchwarzkopf said &quot;nobody will be happier than me&quot; when thecease-fire order arrives. By the end of the day, he got it.The military part of this conflict is over, but the world hasyet to discover if Saddam Hussein himself will acceptPresident Bush's terms and stand down from his aggressions.We confess concerns at letting a creature such as Saddamregain access to the region's diplomatic process. Perhaps ifTariq Aziz is allowed to soil the chambers of the UnitedNations with his smooth words, the walls of the SecurityCouncil should be lined with photographs of his Gestapo'satrocities in Kuwait City.   Still, Mr. Bush and his aides deserve an opportunity tomake their plan work. One of the most reassuring aspects ofthis exercise has been the impression that the President andhis men have thought hard about their strategies. Offeringthe cease-fire as an incentive to surrender, concurrent withthe threat of continued sanctions and a call for reparations,is a plausible plan. We shall see.   In the weeks ahead, many lessons will be drawn from thisenterprise. For now the focus is on the battlefield. We havelearned a few things about the victors:   In Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, the public now hasa new model of the general officer in wartime. Perhaps fromthe perspective of a distant historian, Vietnam will beviewed mainly as the furnace that produced a durable schoolof senior American officers.   To this one must add their style of making battle. Itplaces a new word at the center of the lexicon of warfare:discriminate. The explicit mission of advanced-technologyweaponry displayed in the Gulf is to destroy the enemy'smilitary assets, while minimizing damage to civilians. Theaccuracy and success of the allies' laserguided weaponry areone of the war's notable achievements. However, against theabsolute moral claims routinely made by opponents of force,one may now argue that precision weapons, as used by theseAmerican soldiers, constitute an advance in the morality ofnecessary war.   Ultimately, of course, the war's outcome rests with thetroops. Here they are both the instruments of its remarkablesuccess and its beneficiaries. Some 500,000 Americans and agreat many allies went to war against a huge army led by anincorrigible international outlaw. Now, nearly all of themare returning home. It is an outcome that is as astounding asit is welcome, and for those who made it possible, it shouldbe a moment of great and justifiable pride.</TEXT></DOC>
