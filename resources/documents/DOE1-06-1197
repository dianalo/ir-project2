One regulatory alternativeunder consideration is to put an upper limit on volatility. Volatilityis typically quantified by measurement of Reid vapor pressure. The purposeof the report was to identify and quantify any differences in vapor pressurecaused by the technique used to obtain the sample. The objective of theeffort is identify and document a fast, inexpensive, and reliable methodto obtain enforcement-quality samples at service station-type facilities.The report examines the effect of four sampling techniques and two methodsof analysis on three types of fuels.</TEXT></DOC>
