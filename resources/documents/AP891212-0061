No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coast Guard officials boarded an American fishingboat and questioned the captain today after the vessel collidedwith a Canadian destroyer and drew warning shots from the warshipin a dispute over fishing rights.   The confrontation Monday began after the scalloper Concordiaallegedly was spotted fishing 2.5 miles inside Canadian waters,Coast Guard Petty Officer Ellen Harrington said.   The fishing boat's captain, William Fuery, said this morningthat his charts indicated he was never in Canadian waters. He saidthat the destroyer rammed his vessel and that when the warshipbegan its pursuit, he fled in fear.   ``A plane told me to stop my vessel and wait for a warship,'' hetold a Boston radio station. ``I didn't think it was too good of anidea to wait for a warship. I was out there fishing. I was not atwar.''   He said he headed back toward American waters while dodging theCanadian vessel's warning shots.   ``A couple times I had to change course and get away from himbecause I was afraid he was going to ram me again,'' Fuery said.``When he started shooting at us he was trying to get as close ashe could. At times he was firing shots from a quarter-mile away.''   Canadian officials told a different version. They said thefishing boat rammed the 366-foot destroyer three times, promptingthe warning shots.   The Canadians fired five to 10 rounds with a small,submachine-like gun about 100 yards ahead of the vessel, and whenthat failed to produce any results, they fired a round from a3-inch, .50-caliber gun in front of the Concordia, said Lt. DougMaybee, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy.   An American crewman on deck at the time of the collisionreportedly was hurt and would seek treatment, said Coast Guard Lt.Craig Lloyd.   Coast Guard officials and National Marine Fisheries officersboarded the scalloper in New Bedford, took statements from theboat's master and let it return to its port of Fairhaven, Lloydsaid. The evidence will be used in the Canadian investigation.   There have been several reports this year of American fishingboats crossing the line to work the rich fishing area on theCanadian side.   The destroyer began tracking the Concordia after it was spottedfishing in Canadian waters five times during the weekend, Maybeesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
