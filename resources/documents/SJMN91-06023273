The limitations of the tight Montgomery Theater prevent staging anygrand opera, most French opera, most Rossini and Verdi, and anything withapparitions -- in short, virtually any rep having regular, meaty mezzo parts.;   But McAfee is special, having already appeared with the Pittsburgh Opera.The tall redhead who lights up before crowds bowled over her San Joselisteners by a broad consensus in the recent OSJ Showcase '91, a thinly veiledweekend of auditions for next season. What's more, she bowled over Dalis insinging Dalis' own operatic debut number, &quot;O don fatale.&quot;;    The bad news isthat her triumphal aria is by Verdi. And if she's picked as one of perhaps sixresident artists, OSJ will have to scramble to find enough mainstage works forher.;    Though the opera might offer the ideal role for her, given the rightcolor wig, &quot;Carmen&quot; is out -- unless Dalis finds a new opera house,meanwhile.;    SIGNALS OFF -- The long-awaited San Francisco Symphony recitalseries debut of the Methuselah of pianists, Polish-born Mieczyslaw Horszowski,98, remains just that. On advice of his physicians, he has canceled his Mondayrecital at Davies Hall.;    He was born when Brahms was still alive, and hegave his Warsaw debut in 1901, the year Verdi died.;    Giving sold-outrecitals back East in recent months, he established himself as one of thelongest-lived touring recitalists of all time.;    ON THE GRAPEVINE -- Lookfor George Cleve's wildly successful Midsummer Mozart Festival to stretch evenfarther south next summer, presenting concerts in Cupertino's Flint Center tocelebrate the Mozart bicentennial year.;    Also, European summer touring bycollegiate groups is still on the griddle, war or no war. CharleneArchibeque's San Jose State Choraliers will spend July in England, France, andSwitzerland, leading off with a concert in London's St. Paul's Cathedral.;   Peter Jaffe's 83-member Stanford Symphony will leave June 19 on a tour ofPrague, Leipzig, Berlin, Budapest and Vienna.;    NAMES, NAMES -- Rocker PhilCollins won so many Grammy nominations that you could lose sight of SanFrancisco's Kronos Quartet getting four of their own for their &quot;Black Angels,&quot;which has enjoyed a No. 4 ranking on the Billboard classical record charts.;   Collins is no relation to composer and music critic Phil Collins of SantaCruz New Music Works. It's just one of many name duplications among areamusicians.;    Some others? There's Donald Pippin, impresario of SanFrancisco's Pocket Opera, which is presenting several Mozart operas thissummer, and the conductor namesake who records Cole Porter for Angel Records.;   &quot;He's my age, but from Tennessee,&quot; says the 60-ish San Franciscan. &quot;I'mfrom North Carolina.&quot;;    Close enough!;    Other namesakes and near-missesare San Francisco Symphony cellist Lawrence Granger and Santa Cruz CountySymphony guest conductor John Larry Granger (coming to Aptos Feb. 23-24); JohnWilliams, an Australian concert guitarist who is unrelated to the Boston Popscomposer-conductor of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fame; and the two Ryan Edwards of New York,one a baritone, the other a pianist and composer.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Paul Hertelendy column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910123  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  588  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 23, 199100023273,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
