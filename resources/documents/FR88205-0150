Gauthier, Office ofMarket Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590(202-366-4805).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 21, 1987, the agency publishedcriteria for an Optional NCAP test program for motor vehicle manufacturers(52 FR 31691). The program was instituted to provide manufacturers withan opportunity to retest any of their vehicles that have been tested inthe NCAP program and subsequently modified with production changes to improveoccupant protection. The testing was designed to be conducted at the manufacturers'expense, but under criteria established by NHTSA. These criteria requirethat the testing be conducted at the same test facilities and accordingto the same controls and procedures used for the agency's NCAP testing.The Optional NCAP test results would be published by the agency in itsNCAP press releases.In the November 19, 1986, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice seeking comment on the proposed criteriafor Optional NCAP (51 FR 41888), and in the August 21, 1987, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice announcing the final Optional NCAP criteria,the agency described the rationale for the program. Specifically, ``theagency [has] concluded that it would be helpful to both consumers and thevehicle manufacturers if the information about improved NCAP test resultsfor the modified vehicles were made public as soon as possible.'' The intent of the program was that, as vehicles changed from the ones originallytested in NCAP, manufacturers could request retesting under Optional NCAP.It was assumed that the changes would be made after the NCAP results wereannounced. However, based on information received from Volkswagen of America,Inc., (Volkswagen), it is clear that limiting eligibility for OptionalNCAP to only those vehicles that have had a change made after the NCAPresults are anounced is not consistent with the intent of the program.As previously discussed, Optional NCAP was designed to give informationto consumers on vehicles that have had changes made to improve their NCAPcrash test performance, and, therefore, are different from the vehiclesoriginally tested in NCAP. That is the case with the Volkswagen Fox. VolkswagenFox vehicles currently available in dealer showrooms are different fromthe one tested by NHTSA. Thus, the agency believes that the current NCAPtest data available to the public on some vehicles may not be indicativeof the crash test performance of the vehicle a consumer may actually beconsidering for purchase.In order to correct this type of situation, the agency published a noticeon December 10, 1987, seeking comments on proposed changes to the OptionalNCAP eligibility Criteria Nos. 1.a. and 1.b. (52 FR 46880).The eligibility criteria were proposed to be changed to allow vehiclesto be tested in Optional NCAP as long as the production design changeswere made after the production date of the vehicle tested in NCAP.The agency received comments to the notice from Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler),Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, and Volkswagen of America,Inc. (Volkswagen). All commenters concurred with the agency's proposedchanges to the test vehicle eligibility criteria for Optional NCAP as presented.Chrysler and Volkswagen also provided comments which concerned NCAP ingeneral and the need for several of the Optional NCAP criteria. However,those were unrelated to the proposed amendment to Optional NCAP. Thesecomments are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">The NCAP Program in General</ITAG>Chrysler comented that NCAP is misleading to consumers and that the resultsdo not provide useful, real-world comparative ratings of the crashworthinessof passenger cars and light-duty vehicles. These comments are not relevantto the agency's notice requesting comments on an amendment to OptionalNCAP. However, the agency's position on NCAP and its usefulness to consumerscan be found in the August 21, 1987, notice establishing the criteria forthe Optional NCAP test program for motor vehicle manufacturers (52 FR 31691).<ITAG tagnum="84">Vehicles Eligible To Be Included in the Optional NCAP </ITAG>Volkswagen stated that the agency should allow manufacturers to retestany vehicles they wish under Optional NCAP, without the need to demonstrateto the agency that an improvement has been made. This argument is basedon Volkswagen's belief that a manufacturer is unlikely to underwrite theexpense of Optional NCAP testing unless it is confident that the resultswill demonstrate improvement. The need for Optional NCAP requirements specifyingvehicle eligibility and supporting data criteria (Criteria No. 1 and No.2) were discussed at length in the August 21, 1987, notice establishingthe Optional NCAP test program for motor vehicle manufacturers (52 FR 31691).To briefly reiterate, the agency is not going to use Optional NCAP to disseminateinformation about essentially repetitive testing of unchanged vehicle models.Without the controls established by the Optional NCAP criteria, a manufacturercould use this program to publish different crash test results for unchangedvehicles. Such actions would not benefit consumers or further any purposeof NCAP. Accordingly, the agency is not persuaded by the Volkswagen comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment to the Criteria for Optional NCAP Testing </ITAG>After considering all comments, NHTSA is amending the vehicle eligibilitycriteria in Optional NCAP for the reasons set forth in the proposal andrepeated above. Therefore, Optional NCAP Criteria Nos. 1.a. and 1.b. areamended as follows: 1. The following vehicles are eligible for testing under this program:a. Any model that has previously been tested under the NCAP program, andat some time after the production date of the vehicle tested in NCAP, themanufacturer has made production design changes to the models that arelikely to significantly improve its NCAP test results. b. A model selected by NHTSA that is in the same line as a model that waspreviously tested under the NCAP program, but the tested model is no longerin production, and, at some time after the production date of the vehicletested in NCAP, the manufacturer has made production design changes tothe line of vehicles that are likely to significantly improve the NCAPtest results. The agency will implement these amended criteria for Optional NCAP testingon the day this notice is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Thus, any manufacturer requests for optionaltesting that are received on or after that date will be evaluated underthese amended criteria.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on February 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Diane K.
