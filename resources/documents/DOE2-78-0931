The outside diameter will be 62 cm, and the length 57 cm. Whenoperated at 1.8 K with 2300 A, it will add 4 T to the 9.3 T from a NbTimagnet which surrounds it. By using pre-reacted conductors we can obtainstrength from cold worked copper and avoid the complications from havingto heat treat such a large coil. Obviously, the advantages had to beweighed against the measures which would have to be taken to avoid damagingthe brittle Nb/sub 3/Sn.</TEXT></DOC>
