The vote was 51-47, nine short of the 60 required to limitdebate. The margin was the same on Tuesday.   ``In the end, we will win this battle'' next year, Sen. BobPackwood, R-Ore., said after the first vote.   Congressional leaders had agreed in advance that the two days ofSenate debate on the proposal would put the issue to rest untilnext year.   At the White House earlier today, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater told reporters, ``We consider yesterday's vote just thebeginning.''   Bush promised a capital gains cut in last year's presidentialcampaign as a way to encourage investment and create jobs. Theproposal has dominated debate over budget issues for several months.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, pleaded forDemocratic loyalty and assailed Bush for spending so much effort towin the cut. A reduction, Mitchell said, would bloat the deficit bytens of billions of dollars in the long run and serve up a majortax windfall for the nation's richest people.   ``This amendment evinces no concern about investment or with thefuture,'' Mitchell said. ``It is concerned only with the presentand the political benefits that may flow from cutting taxes....   ``Given our circumstances, when so many in our nation arewithout decent housing, cannot afford an education, lack healthinsurance, it is a travesty that the Senate should now be seriouslyconsidering a huge tax cut for the very wealthy with no evidencethat it will assist the economy,'' Mitchell said.   Economists estimate that 80 percent of the benefit of a cut intaxes on capital gains _ profits from the sale of investments _would go to people with incomes above $100,000 a year. Those withincomes above $200,000 would get tax cuts averaging $24,000.   Republicans accused opponents of engaging in class-warfarerhetoric.   ``This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said Packwood,contending a tax cut would benefit investors while producingincreased revenue for the government to spend on social programs.``You don't get many deals better than that.''   The House, with backing of one of every four Democrats, approveda different capital gains cut in September.   Present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates thatapply to wages and other income.   The Packwood-Roth plan would mean lower taxes for capital gains;the longer an asset was held, the less of the profit from its salewould be taxed.   Only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset ownedmore than one year would be taxed. That percentage would increaseby five points for each additional year up to seven; only 65percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more thanseven years is sold.   Investments in smaller companies would get an even better break;up to 50 percent could escape taxation.   The Senate proposal, written by Packwood and Sen. Bill Roth,R-Del., would combine a capital gains tax cut with expandedIndividual Retirement Accounts. Unlike existing IRAs, which permitsome workers to avoid tax on contributions of up to $2,000 a year,the new version would simply exempt from tax any inerest earned onan IRA.   In addition, a worker could make penalty-free withdrawals fromthe new IRAs for paying medical or education expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
