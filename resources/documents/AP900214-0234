(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. isn't givingup the fight against a hostile takeover bid from Georgia-PacificCorp., but it is ready to concede its independence.   The Norwalk, Conn.-based paper-products company, which has beenfighting Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion offer for more than threemonths, said Tuesday that several recent setbacks have led it toconsider a merger, although it wants a higher price thanGeorgia-Pacific's $63-a-share bid.   Georgia-Pacific went to court in Portland, Maine, this morningto mount a challenge to some of Great Northern's latest moves.   The company faces a showdown at a March shareholders meeting atwhich Georgia-Pacific is seeking to have the company's directorsreplaced with its own candidates, who would allow the merger to gothrough.   Stephen M. Hill, Great Northern's director of investorrelations, said ``it certainly was a possibility'' shareholderswould back Georgia-Pacific.   Great Northern's directors on Tuesday postponed the shareholdermeeting to March 20 from March 2 to give shareholders time toconsider other possible offers. Great Northern also said it haddirected its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., to contactqualified buyers and seek bids higher than $63 a share.   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reached in Atlanta thismorning, said her company had gotten no information beyond GreatNorthern's announcement Tuesday evening.   ``Based on the information in Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.'spress release, our view is that Great Northern's attempt topostpone the March 2 shareholder meeting and to amend its poisonpill are unlawful and ignore the interests of shareholders,''Georgia-Pacific said in a statement. ``We intend to seekappropriate relief.''   Georgia-Pacific attorneys filed papers in U.S. District Court inPortland this morning, asking Judge Gene Carter to stop GreatNorthern from delaying the March 2 meeting, Ms. Smith said. Thecourt clerk's office said a filing had been made byGeorgia-Pacific, but it had not yet been processed and madeavailable to the public by late morning.   Georgia-Pacific has said in the past that all terms of itstender offer were negotiable.   Great Northern's announcement follows several setbacks in itsefforts to remain independent.   Earlier in the week, Georgia-Pacific announced it was sellingoff some of its paper operations to avoid antitrust questions thatcould impede the merger. Great Northern had raised the antitrustissues in a federal lawsuit in Connecticut that it considered itsfirst line of defense in the takeover battle.   In addition, a federal judge in Maine has struck down variousprovisions in Great Northern's bylaws that would have made thetakeover more difficult.   Great Northern said the accumulation of events led its board ofdirectors to seek other potential buyers.   ``The board believes that it is in the best position to conductan orderly, active and effective exploration of all financialalternatives, designed to culminate in the highest possible pershare value for shareowners,'' said Great Northern chairman WilliamR. Laidig. ``We believe that a price of $63 per share is certainlyachievable.''   Great Northern stock closed at $62, up 50 cents, in New YorkStock Exchange trading Tuesday. The company's announcement was madeafter the market closed.   Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based forest products company,proposed buying Great Northern last year in a move that wouldcreate the largest company in the industry with $14 billion inannual sales. Great Northern has fought the bid vigorously, sayingthe price is too low and illegal on antitrust grounds.   A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., is hearing testimony onwhether the new company would have a stranglehold on linerboard,check paper and certain pulpwood markets, as Great Northern allegesin its antitrust suit.   The company also has criticized Georgia-Pacific harshly formaking the bid, saying it's trying to beef up its financial healthand operating efficiency at the expense of Great Northernshareholders.   ``We still felt that was the case,'' Hill said. ``But we're at apoint in time where it's appropriate to (seek other buyers) toassure getting the best value for the shareholders.''   Hill would not comment on possible buyers. ``It's getting intofairly high finance, so there aren't that many players,'' he said.   After Georgia-Pacific, the largest forest products companies areWeyerhauser Inc. and International Paper Co., according totestimony from Georgia-Pacific chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. inBridgeport.   When asked what price the company was seeking, Hill said, ``Thebest one possible with a qualified buyer, somebody with money topay.''</TEXT></DOC>
