As of January, 75% of a group of lung cancer patients who underwent surgery and vaccination more than five years ago were alive and free of cancer, Ariel C. Hollinshead, professor of pharmacology at George Washington University, told reporters at an American Cancer Society seminar here. By comparison, only 33% of the patients who had surgery but weren't vaccinated were alive and free of cancer five years later.    The effectiveness of the new vaccine was first reported last fall. In the earlier report, based on data as of March 1986, 69% of vaccinated patients were alive and free of cancer five years later compared with 49% of the unvaccinated patients. These data, however, included many patients who weren't properly vaccinated in the early days of the vaccine's use, the researchers noted. The new data, Ms. Hollishead said, is based on 81 patients treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, where procedures were closely followed.    The vaccine, made by Ms. Hollinshead from proteins extracted from lung cancer tissues, is designed to be used in patients whose cancer is caught early, when the tumor can be removed surgically. It stimulates the body's immune system to fight off any recurrence of the lung cancer and is one of the first uses of &quot;immunotherapy&quot; to treat cancer. Vaccines are under development to treat colon and skin cancers. </TEXT></DOC>
