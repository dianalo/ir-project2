After falling more than $1 a barrel early yesterday inU.S. futures trading, crude oil for November deliveryrebounded in the afternoon to break briefly through the $39 abarrel mark.</LP><TEXT>   The November crude contract failed by 15 cents to reachthe previous futures high of $39.20 a barrel that had beenposted during trading only Monday. But it was up $1.14 forthe day to settle at $38.67 a barrel -- the highest ever forthe closing price of a so-called prompt-month crude on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   In London trading, Brent crude for November delivery alsostaged an afternoon rally to a record futures high of $38.20a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. TheNovember Brent then pulled back some to settle at $37.95, up85 cents for the day.   Oil analysts credited war talk, unfounded rumors andspeculation concerning the Middle East crisis for the crudeoil rebounds on both futures exchanges. Among the factorscited were the extension of the United Nations embargoagainst Iraq to shipments by air, Iraqi statements that thismove was an &quot;act of war&quot; and comments by U.S. governmentofficials of the increasing likelihood Saddam Hussein woulduse military force to retaliate against the sanctions.   There were also rumors -- all denied -- that an Iraqiplane had been shot down in the Persian Gulf and thatPresident Bush had issued Iraq a new ultimatum to abandonKuwait.   Crude oil is affected more than fuels, but all prices arebeing pushed higher than supply-demand fundamentals justifyby the growing concern about a possible war in the MiddleEast, oil analysts said.   &quot;The war premium is around $15 a barrel,&quot; said George F.Friesen, a New York-based vice president and energy analystwith the Deutsche Bank Group. &quot;Once this crisis is resolved,oil prices will come down to the low twenties again,&quot; hesaid.   Downward pressures could start as soon as today, promptedby President Bush's authorization of the sale of oil from theStrategic Petroleum Reserve. While there are no actualshortages of crude to justify drawing on governmentstockpiles, the theory is that economic damage could bereduced if oil prices are brought down from the artificiallyhigh levels.   Fuels prices were mixed yesterday. Heating oil remainedstrong on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the Octobercontract rising 1.37 cents to nearly $1.03 a gallon. Butgasoline was further weakened, as expected, by the latestindustry report of higher U.S. gasoline inventories, whichsuggests a slackening in demand. The futures price ofunleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.95 cents,although it managed to settle a notch above $1 a gallon.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices were strong butplatinum and silver weakened. December delivery gold was up$5.20 an ounce at $412.80. October platinum dropped $3.80 anounce to end at $448.00, after trading as low as $440.00.This is the first time that the October price has brokenbelow the critical $445.00 support level, which had heldsince the beginning of 1988. December silver was off 4.2cents an ounce at $4.8730. Gold continued to reflect MiddleEastern tensions, according to William O'Neill, seniorfutures strategist for Merrill Lynch. Also, he said, therewere rumors of a coup in the Soviet Union, which added to thepolitical unrest that has been the principal price-supportingfactor in gold. Meanwhile, platinum was weighed down byslowing industrial demand as well as a lack of investordemand for bullion, Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;Platinum is beingaffected most directly by the slumping automobile industry,but a world-wide economic slowdown that has hit base metalsis also having its effect on platinum,&quot; he said. There islittle demand from Japan, where platinum is the favoriteprecious metal, and platinum output has increased in SouthAfrica, the leading producer, he said. &quot;While this platinumisn't sold into futures directly, it is sold to dealers whoeventually hedge it in futures, and the effect of the salesis felt,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said. The biggest disappointment amongtraders, though, is that the platinum market has failed torespond to the increasing violence in South Africa in recentweeks, Mr. O'Neill said. While silver has lagged, too, ithasn't been as weak as platinum, he said. &quot;If gold posts astrong gain and it succeeds in thrusting above, say, the key$425 level, it could touch off a sharp rally in silver,&quot; hesaid.                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices are likely toget some support this morning from export agreementsannounced after the close of trading yesterday. The U.S. willsell 1.2 million metric tons of wheat to Morocco under thegovernment's export bonus plan, and an additional 500,000metric tons to west African countries, futures analysts said.In relatively light trading yesterday, wheat and corn futuresprices were supported by continued rumors that an agreementis in the works to sell flour or grain to the Soviet Union. Ameeting of Soviet grain trading officials in Washington withU.S. officials is sparking the as-yet unfounded rumors,traders said. Wheat futures for December delivery gained 1.75cents a bushel to close at $2.7650. December corn futuresadded 0.5 cent a bushel to close at $2.2825. Soybean futuresprices declined in response to warm weather across much ofthe Midwest and prospects for an excellent harvest. Novembersoybeans slid two cents a bushel to close at $6.1550.                                                                                                          COPPER: A very strong price for the September contract,which expired yesterday, highlighted futures trading; otherdeliveries showed only slight price changes. The Septembercontract ended with a gain of 4.60 cents a pound at $1.3380,after trading as high as $1.35. Active demand for contractsdeveloped because of the large number of outstandingSeptember contacts that remained to be nullified by oppositetrades or delivery of the commodity compared with limiteddeliverable supplies, according to analysts. &quot;First there wasthe weight of liquidation in London last week, and then thefocus switched to the tight deliverable supplies forSeptember contracts and the high open interest,&quot; one analystsaid. &quot;With the September expiration out of the way, tradersnow will concentrate more on fundamental supply-demandconsiderations,&quot; he said. The world-wide economic slowdownthat could result in reduced copper consumption is a majorfactor, he said.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices eased. The December contract was off$14 a metric ton to $1,274. Gill andamp; Duffus, a major Londoncocoa trading company, made its first estimate of the worldcocoa crop for the 1990-91 season, which will begin Oct. 1.The company projected output at 2.4 million tons, aboutunchanged from the current season. Consumption, it said, willamount to almost 2.3 million tons, up from 2.2 million tonsthis season. As a result, the surplus next season will narrowto about 130,000 tons from 187,000 tons this season. Thiswill be the seventh consecutive surplus, Gill andamp; Duffus said.Although a smaller surplus is predicted, &quot;it is hard to getexcited about that, considering that global stocks of cocoaamount to 1.5 million tons, the equivalent of about eightmonths usage, even though we are heading into the peakconsumption season,&quot; said Judith Ganes, analyst for MerrillLynch.</TEXT></DOC>
