Brezhnev's friend and law enforcementchief, Nikolai A. Shchelokov, accepted lavish gifts and hugebribes, then killed himself when his deeds were discovered, thegovernment charged Tuesday.   The allegations about the former Interior Minister, who died indisgrace in 1984, came on the second day of the bribery-corruptiontrial of Yuri M. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law. Churbanov servedas Shchelokov's top deputy.   The charges included the first official confirmation of rumorsthat the 73-year-old Shchelokov committed suicide when he felt thelaw closing in.   Churbanov and eight former Interior Ministry officials from theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan are on trial before a SovietSupreme Court military tribunal. Their highly publicized trial isbeing used to further leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive againstcorruption and cronyism.   The trial also is seen as a further attempt to discreditPresident Brezhnev, whose 1964-1982 regime is routinely referred toby Gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation in theSoviet Union.   A 1,500-page indictment against the accused charges Churbanovwith accepting the equivalent of $1 million in bribes, and itspassages about Shchelokov, read aloud by a clerk to a full andsilent courtroom, gave the most detailed account yet of corruptionin the tops ranks of the Brezhnev regime.   Recent newspaper reports have said Shchelokov, the InteriorMinistry chief for 16 years, lined his pockets with 700,000 rubles($1.1 million) in state funds and lived an extravagant lifestyle,giving foreign luxury cars to his children and buying furs andcrystal chandeliers for himself and his family.   ``He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, and some ofthe defendants in the Moscow bribery-corruption trial allegedlyobliged him.   Six times a year, food shipments from Uzbekistan arrived at aMoscow airport and were taken to Shchelekov's country home outsidethe capital, the indictment said. The shipments contained cognac,tomatoes, melons, apricots and other fruits and vegetablesunobtainable in Moscow most of the year.   When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the minister,who was in charge of the Soviet Union's uniformed police force,always politely accepted them and said, ``I thank you.''   Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he didn't want.   According to the indictment, Shchelokov once was taken to afactory in Uzbekistan, the center of the crime ring being exposedin the Moscow trial, and was offered clothes and other productsmade there.   He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of jewelryfor his wife. On another occasion, he received three pearls, eachworth 3,300 rubles ($5,300), the indictment said.   The court documents said boxes of money were left onShchelokov's desk. One of the nine defendants, former UzbekInterior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, was quoted in the indictment asacknowledging that he gave his Moscow-based superior boss 105,000rubles ($170,000), and neckties, gold jewelry, precious stones andother valuables.   Yakhyaev explained the payments by saying they were necessary to``win protection in the successful struggle against crime in therepublic,'' the indictment said. Of Shchelokov, Yakhyaev said: ``Hewas a capable person, a good speaker and an influential man.''   Shchelokov was one of the closest confidants of Brezhnev, whowas Communist Party chief from 1964 until his death in December1982. Under his tenure, the Interior Ministry became notorious forcorruption, and he was fired by Brezhnev's successor, former KGBchief Yuri V. Andropov.   The indictment referred to Shchelokov and two former Uzbekpolice officials, and said: ``Their involvement in the crimescommitted was proved in full measure. However, fearing retributionfor what they had done, they committed suicide. In view of this,the cases against them were abated.''   The trial in the neo-classic Supreme Court building in centralMoscow entered its second day with one defendant absent because ofa heart ailment.   The judge rejected a defense request to halt the proceedings,which are giving Soviets a rare glimpse into the high livingenjoyed by some Kremlin officials.   Two other defendants were treated by a doctor in the courtroom,and the military tribunal's chief judge, Army Maj. Gen. MikhailMarov, called a 50-minute recess so Yakhyaev, who looked haggardand dazed, could have his blood pressure checked by a doctor cladin a white smock.   The principal defendant in the case, Churbanov, who marriedBrezhnev's daughter Galina, could receive the death penalty ifconvicted on charges he accepted more than $1 million in cashbribes and gifts, as well as regular supplies of wine, cognac,pomegranates, grapes and other hard-to-find fruit flown to him viathe Soviet airline Aeroflot from Uzbekistan.</TEXT></DOC>
