Yet Kitty Kelley, author of a scandalous new book titled &quot;NancyReagan: The Unauthorized Biography&quot; (Simon and Schuster), insists that formerPresident Reagan's wife was the most influential first lady in Americanhistory.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AUTHOR: NANCY REAGAN 'WAS A GOOD PRESIDENT'  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;She was our president for eight years,&quot; Kelley stated in a weekendinterview. &quot;If you ask me what's the best thing I can say about Mrs. Reagan,I'd say, 'She was a good president.' &quot;;    The much-ballyhooed book thusseriously challenges what long has been the conventional wisdom about NancyReagan's role at the White House and adds to the already burgeoning historicalrecord of President Reagan's many failures to fully take command of his ownadministration.;    Kelley, 48, insists that President Reagan's former aides,as well as Mrs. Reagan herself, intentionally minimized the influence that thefirst lady wielded in the White House.;    &quot;I asked somebody, 'How does itwork?' &quot; Kelley recalled in the interview.;    &quot;Well, they said, first Nancytells the president what she wants done. Usually it's done; he'll do it. Buton occasion, they said, he was like a truculent child; he might say, 'No, Iwon't do it.' Well, she'll get it done. When she did hit him head on and heresisted, she then would go out and have other people do it. She would bringin the reserves.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910408  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  271  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 8, 199100099202,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
