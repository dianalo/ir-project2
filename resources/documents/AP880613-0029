Territorial disputes may increase as animals concentrate arounddwindling water supplies in late summer and fall, says Fitzhugh.   Jim Vashro of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parkssaid fish in streams and rivers are forced to move to deeper holesfor protection.   ``The fish are concentrated more, so the predation and foodcompetition goes up,'' he said. ``There's a larger mortality rateand less oxygen. As the water temperatures go up, the oxygen needsof the fish go up, and they become stressed, their growth rate isslowed, or they die.''   The dry weather could mean fewer ducks for the fall huntingseason.   Gay Simpson of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish andParks said many nesting areas have dried up, although the extent ofthe problem won't be fully known until after a breeding pair surveyand brood count are conducted.   Around Atlanta coyotes, descendants of animals smuggled in byhunters, have taken to raiding watermelon patches in search ofwater, state wildlife officials say. Rats are reported invadingyards in the San Francisco Bay area in search of water.   Even handouts for birds could be affected.   ``Feed prices are way up already with the dry weather,'' saidTom Westman, owner of several Minnesota Greenery Wild Bird Stores.`In just the last month we've seen a 25 percent increase in ourcosts on sunflower seeds. If some of these areas don't startgetting rain, then in the fall prices will continue to climb.''</TEXT><HEAD>Forests</HEAD><TEXT>   California Department of Forestry Director Jerry Partain says hebrought crews on early and added extra seasonal firefightersbecause he fears the drought could fuel a firestorm exceeding theravages of the lightning-spawned blazes of 1987 that blackenednearly a million acres. Large sections of forest may be closed tothe public because of fire danger.   Drought-weakened trees are beginning to die under insect attackin some areas.</TEXT><HEAD>Recreation</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I've got eight boat slips out of 60 I can't use becausethey're out of the water,'' said Mike Williams, president of theInternational Falls (Minn.) Chamber of Commerce and co-owner ofThunderbird Lodge on Rainy Lake on the Canadian border.   Lake Tahoe, on the Nevada-California state line, is fed bysnowmelt in the Sierras, but there was little snow last winter. Nowat least two public boat ramps can't be used because of the fallingwater level.   Gary Midkiff, assistant director of the Tahoe Regional PlanningAgency, also said the low water is harming the lake's delicatewater quality. He says the falling water level lets sunlight warmthe lake deeper than usual, encouraging the growth of algae.</TEXT><HEAD>Migrant Workers</HEAD><TEXT>   There's no work waiting for hundreds of migrant workers whojourney north to Minnesota's Red River Valley every year to thinand weed sugar beets.   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after akilling frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the drysoil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.   Between 200 and 300 migrant farm workers have added their namesto a waiting list for temporary work at the Minnesota Jobs andTraining office in Polk County, said Armando Cuellar, a migrantlabor counselor at the office.</TEXT></DOC>
