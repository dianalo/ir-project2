Monday's rise in New York generally supported prices, traders said.    Tokyo share prices fell in thin trading as many institutional investors sold off shares to balance end-of-month trading accounts.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which rose 129.87 points Monday, fell 215.82 to close at 22741.02. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 14.98 to 1825.46. First section volume was pegged at a light 400 million shares, down from 500 million shares Monday.    Reports on the Group of Seven statement didn't appear to have an immediate effect on stock prices in early trading in Tokyo Wednesday. The Nikkei index declined 116.40 to 22624.62 at the end of the morning session.    Traders said large steel and heavy industrial stocks were carried lower Tuesday in the dull, pre-holiday spate of year-end profit-taking, eroding earlier rumors of a strong pre-Christmas rally on the Nikkei orchestrated by major brokerage houses. &quot;It means that expectations of a year-end rally are unrealistic,&quot; said one broker.    Tuesday's lackluster movements in share prices, despite a mildly bullish open in the wake of a 15-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Monday trading, fed notions investors are weary and aren't disposed to new investment undertakings until the beginning of the new year.    The deft hand of major brokerages was manifest in certain shares that resisted Tuesday's bearish tide. Advantest, a Fujitsu-affiliated measuring instruments maker, surged 250 yen to 6,100 ($48) on what sources said was heavy buying by a single large Japanese securities house. Ando Electric, another instrument maker, shot up 230 to 3,630.    Retailers were strong on optimism about rising personal consumption statistics that suggest the industry is enjoying a holiday buying boom and will continue to prosper next year. Daiei was up 40 to 1,510, and Marui rose 20 to 2,940.    In heavy industrial benchmarks, Ishikawajima-Harima fell 23 to 662, Fuji Heavy Industries fell 15 to 530, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries eased 1 point to 254. Profit-taking in the sector, which includes shipbuilders, reflected investor belief the stocks were overbought because of buying campaigns launched by big brokerages to boost market volume.    In London, share prices closed narrowly mixed as an earlier wave of buying dried up and participants reacted to a weak opening on Wall Street.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 3.8 points at 1408.9. Volume was 601.7 million shares, up from 576.8 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 2.8 points at 1747.4 at the close.    The market rose to its peak soon after the opening, buoyed by a dawn raid on the shares of Blue Circle Industries by the brokerage James Capel andamp; Co., acting for an unidentified buyer.    The raid, which followed other recent stake-building and takeover activity among British companies, helped boost general confidence in the equity market, dealers said.    But share prices drifted during the rest of the day in thin trading, and the 100-share index slipped into negative territory after a weak early trend Tuesday in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 24.53 points at 1965.85 around the time the London market closed.    The corporate confidence in the market shown by recent stake-building and takeover activity wasn't matched by largescale institutional buying, dealers said.    The dawn raid on Blue Circle followed two other major takeover bids launched by British companies earlier in December. Barker andamp; Dobson made a cash and share bid for Dee Corp. that values Dee at around #2 billion ($3.66 billion), and British Petroleum is offering 450 pence a share for the Britoil shares it doesn't own.    Britoil fell 14 to 412 ahead of an expected statement by the British panel on takeovers and mergers on whether BP can proceed with the Britoil bid. BP was up 1 at 252.    BP new shares were heavily traded Tuesday, prompting speculation the Kuwait Investment Office was buying more shares to boost its stake from the 16.1% level announced Monday. A total of 132 million BP new shares were traded, around one-fifth of total stock exchange volume.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed mixed in thin dealing after the market gave up most of its early gains.    Brokers said there was hardly any activity on the floor, as banks and investment funds are closing their books before the holidays.    The stability of the dollar and the day-earlier gains on Wall Street provided the market with a firm undertone, but there weren't enough buy orders to sustain the gains, they said.    Automobile, chemical and machinery shares were slightly higher, but financial stocks declined. Bayerische Motoren Werke climbed 5 marks to 477 marks ($293), Volkswagen gained 1.5 to 235.5, and Daimler-Benz edged up half a mark to 615.5.    Among chemical shares, Hoechst added 1.2 to 261.7, and BASF rose 1.1 to 262.5.    Among financial shares, Deutsche Bank eased 2 to 411.5, and Commerzbank slid 1.5 to 225.    Elsewhere in Europe, stocks closed up in Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan, but fell in Paris and were mixed in Amsterdam.    Zurich was the scene of lively trading, as foreign participants and institutional investors focused their attention on bargains, dealers said. The dollar's seeming stabilization above 1.32 Swiss francs also bolstered spirits, they said.    In Asia, share prices closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Hong Kong and Taipei and were lower in Wellington.    Stocks in Sydney rose for the third consecutive day on buoyant copper, nickel and aluminum prices.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Dec 21    Dec 18     Year U.S. ........................... 232.1     231.6    +  1.8 Britain ........................ 527.0     517.1    +  5.9 Canada ......................... 354.1     352.4    +  6.3 Japan ......................... 1088.9    1086.5    + 15.2 France ......................... 298.3     293.6    - 26.9 Germany ........................ 162.6     160.2    - 37.4 Hong Kong ..................... 1630.3    1561.1    -  8.4 Switzerland .................... 142.7     139.9    - 28.9 Australia ...................... 243.3     240.9    -  7.8 World index .................... 411.6     409.3    + 15.3</TEXT></DOC>
