(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A few years ago, there was a burst of activity among vendors of small systemsas PC-based editorial and classified systems seemed to spring up out of diewoodwork at frequent intervals.andP;  Then the pace of change slowed as systemswere stabilized and enhanced, marketing efforts were bolstered, and some ofthe new vendors quietly disappeared from the scene.andM;Now a new flurry of activity is upon us.andP;  This time the trend is to providemuch broader functionality than had originally been planned.andP;  The move istoward adding display ,ad functionality, ad dummying, news layout, and evenfull pagination to the existing editorial and classified capabilities thathave proved to be easily adequate for the needs of small and medium-sizednewspapers.andM;This isn't to say that the small vendors are ready to challenge the largeones.andP;  The thorny issues that have presented such a stumbling block to largervendors-e.g., graphics and the database-are of considerably less concem tosmaller papers.andP;  So it has been easier for smaller vendors to avoid dealingwith these tricky matters.andP;  But some of them are starting to work on suchfacilities, so we may see progress here in the future.andM;Summary.andP;  The following introductory summary of this section and thedetailed, vendor-by-vendor review that follows will give a flavor of the newintensity that has struck this market.andM;Amodcs is moving into handling display ads for use in Yellow Pagesdirectories, which it already paginates.andP;  The initial thrust in thisdirection provides tools for managing art and tracking the status of ads.andM;CSE introduced its own handamp;j program that runs with its PageSpec layout programand XyWrite editor.andP;  It includes a galley preview mode.andP;  Also new from CSE isa Queue Handler running on the network to facilitate tasks.andM;CompuText demonstrated enhancements to the classified' program that made itsdebut in a hotel suite at last year's show.andM;Concept Publishing now offers ad dummying and ad management software, wireservice input, classified ad software, and some basic page layout toolsevolving from its AdWorks program, as it moves toward providing a completesolution for small and medium-sized papers.andP;  It is also continuing to add toits color capabilities.andM;The Electronic Publisher demonstrated the status of its DataPage facility forintegrating its editorial features with Quark Xpress for page layout.andP;  Italso provides classified booking.andM;GB Techniques, in its second ANPA appearance, showed major changes to itsterminal and keyboard, including a color monitor, plus new editorial featuresand its latest dassified enhancements.andP;  One of the highlights of dieeditorial product is its Atex-like composition commands.andM;Graph-X unveiled its editorial system, which rans on PCs on Novell networksand is designed to be easy for reporters to use, and also showed a classifiedpackage.andP;  Not shown werc a display ad system under development and theUnified Technologies TypeCasts program, which will be used for pagination.andM;Information Engineering has moved far beyond its PC News Layout package tobegin to provide full system capabilities.andP;  It demonstrated an editorialpackage using XyWrite and a new set of composition commands, a wire serviceinput program it developed, an interface to Archetype Designer for WYSIWYGdisplay and modification of pages, and a status tracking feature associatedwith News Layout.andP;  It also supports the Infosel/Infodex storage and retrievalsystem.andM;LaserMaker showed a version of its layout system that is now going into liveoperation in England and wiU soon be installed in its first site in the U.S.andM;Mycro-Tek demonstrated the MasterPlanner program for creating ad dummies,which is being interfaced to a new, enhanced version of its advertisingsystem.andP;  Also ncw was die announcement that Quark Xpress has been selected toprovide pagination capabilities for Mycro-Tek.andM;One-for-One showed how its Optimum (Versacompbased) PC software can be usedfor making up classified ad pages.andM;Rockwell Computer unveiled a photo management system for its Mac-basedsystem.andP;  It also has improved its dassified system.andM;Synaptic Micro Solutions added a few new wrinkles to its SunType editorialand classified systems, but the main news was the nearly completed deal withAdvent for 3B2 software for display ad creation and pagination.andM;Amdocs adds production control for adsandM;Amdocs, the vendor of systems for producing Yellow Pages directories, isbroadening its scope into the display ad arena.andP;  In initial product here is asystem for organizing and simplifying the workflow by providing tools formanaging art and tracking the status of ads to be used in Yellow Pagesdirectories.andP;  It doesn't currently include software designed for creationofdisplay ads, but it provides interfaces to Camex systems and desktoppublishing programs such as PageMaker for this purpose.andP;  PageMaker wasdemonstrated at ANPA.andM;The control program provides the organization for storing and retrievingdifferent types of an, including logos, a stock an library and custom art foruse only with certain accounts.andP;  The system stores items in compressedbit-map form, including high-resolution versions for output andlow-resolution versions for display.andP;  They are organized in categories andsubcategories for quick access.andP;  Items are stored only once and can beaccessed for multiple use through an indexing system.andP;  The operator can viewthumbnail versions of the graphics prior to calling for them.andM;Display ads created on another system are stored in the database, to beaccessed by number, customer name, address, phone number, etc.andP;  Amdocssupports a spelling checker for use when text is typed into an ad or whenidentifying information about the ad is typed.andM;The system tracks the status of ads to report which ones are ready, whetherproof printouts have been made, and so on.andP;  It also generates reports onproduction statistics, ad usage, etc., and prints a catalog of all storedart.andM;Amdocs reported that its system is being installed at GTE and at BellAtlantic Directory Graphics.andM;CSE develops own handamp;jandM;Compatible Systems Engineering used the show as the formal debut of an handamp;jpackage that enables it to put together an editorial/layout system withouthaving to use programs like Atex or Magna to provide composition.andP;  Intendedto be used in conjunction with CSE's PageSpec program for designing pages, itresembles Atex in some of its commands and basic functionality.andP;  It usesXyWrite as the editing program and runs on a NoveU network.andM;The handamp;j package runs in a PC with 640K of memory, but if extra memory isavailable, the handamp;j function uses it, freeing space in standard memory forother features.andM;The handamp;j program.andP;  Handamp;j is based on logic plus a 90,000word dictionary (notdemonstrated), taken from Webster's College Dictionary.andP;  The user sets up ajustification zone bounded by the minimum and maximum permissible interwordspace values.andP;  (Unfortunately, the ideal spaceband value is used on quaddedand ragged lines, not for justification.andP;  CSE says it will be used forjustification in the release version.)andM;The system tries to break at the spaceband closest to the minimum-in otherwords, to fit as much text on each line as possible.andP;  If there is nospaceband within the justification zone, it tries to hyphenate.andP;  The usercontrols the maximum number of consecutive lines that can be hyphenated.andP;  Thesystem imposes its own minimum size of a hyphenatable word: five characters.andO;The user can specify either die number of characters that must precede ahyphen or the number that must follow, but not both.andP;  (That is, if you askfor two characters before a hyphen, you also get three after, and viceversa.) The system will end a line on an em dash or a slash if appropriate.andO;Some of the handamp;j features haven't been implemented yet, so we will withholdour evaluation until we have seen the finished product.andM;Automatic pair keming and tracking will be supported, but they weren'tdemonstrated.andM;In the initial version, the system gets its handamp;j parameters from a style filespecified by the operator.andP;  Later it will pick up line length and indentinformation from the page layout.andM;Display modes.andP;  The standard screen will display composed files in monospacedmode, using a Hercules display card to differentiate between various types ofhyphens and to show other special characters.andP;  For files that have beenhandamp;j'ed, die screen will show the number of lines and the depth (currendy inpoints, but later to be in picas also), plus the locations of column breaks.andO;It also will display the current position of die cursor on the status line.andM;A galley preview will be available for use with a Hercules card and Bitstreamfonts, which will be scaled on the fly to match the widths of outputcharacters (for Autologic APS, Linotype Cora and Information InternationalVideoComp, with Compugraphic coming soon).andP;  As of the show, the preview couldonly be printed, not displayed, but a full preview is  promised.andM;Files that have been assigned to pages using PageSpec will be displayed onthe PageSpec screen in WYSIWYG format, also using Bitstream fonts.andP;  TheWYSIWYG page preview has some nice shortcuts for displaying certain areas.andO;If the system starts to display a story, a column or a block that theoperator doesn't need to see, the displaying of that portion can be halted atany point with a quick command and die preview will proceed to the next storyor column.andM;Beta testing of the full program with composition was scheduled to begin soonafter ANPA.andP;  No formal release date has been set.andM;Queue Elandler.andP;  CSE also unveiled a new version of a program called QueueHandler, which expedites a variety of tasks from any workstation on thenetwork, using dedicated processors on the net.andP;  Any DOS executable programcan be executed and controlled by Queue Handler: proofing, final output,search/replace, file translation, communications, DOS copying, and so on.andP;  Anearlier version, released a few months ago, managed a single task.andP;  Thelatest one can handle multiple tasks.andM;Installations.andP;  CSE reports new sales to Ziff-Davis, Business Week (3PageSpec stations for laying out entire issues), and the National Geographic(one PageSpec).andP;  It also has instaUed facilities at the Computer Shopper fordesigning pages and sending XyWrite files into Quark Xpress for composition.andM;CompuText smooths its rough edgesandM;In its second ANPA appearance, CompuText brought some enhancements to itsUnix PC-based classified system, which is called Compuclass, and a newdisplay ad system called CAT, which is discussed under &quot;Display ad systems.&quot;andM;The best way to describe die class ad system is to say that it is now muchmore refined.andP;  Most of the rough edges the product had a year ago are gone.andO;In addition, CompuText has added a nice shorthand notation for handlingmultiple publications and zoned editions.andP;  For example, when a group coderepresenting multiple zones is entered by the ad taker, the systemautomatically creates a window to handle die multiple schedules.andP;  It has alsoextended in simple, table-driven rate structure with more of the optionslarger papers are looking for.andP;  In general, it is now very sophisticated,especially for a PC product,andM;Compuclass is now running in Alexandria, LA, with eight terminals.andP;  A secondinstallation is scheduled for August I in Madison, WI, which will have 32terminals.andM;Concept moves on several frontsandM;Concept Publishing, whose forte has been its AdWorks program for creatingdisplay ads on a Macintosh, has been broadening its scope.andP;  It now providessoftware for dummying the ads of a newspaper to create a news hole.andP;  It hasexpanded the capabilities of AdWorks to include some features for making upnews pages interactively.andP;  It has developed facilities for managing displayand classified ads.andP;  It has continued to work on support for color, althoughit hasn't yet arranged a deal for color separation software.andP;  And it nowaccommodates wire service input.andM;AdNet II.andP;  The AdNet II dummying and ad management system, demonstrated inearly form at last year's show, is now in usc in customer sites.andP;  It providesfacilities for creating page templates specifying page size, column width andgutter size.andP;  The user indicates the minimum and maximum percentage of eachpage that can be allocated for ads, the shape of the ad stack (pyramid leftor right, etc.), the type of section (features, sports, etc.), and any areathat is to be reserved for text.andM;Ads are pulled directly from the AdNet II database by date and placedautomatically according to page or section requests that have been made.andP;  Theprogram places coupon ads so as to avoid conflicts with coupons on thereverse page, but it doesn't handle specific requests such as keepingseparate the ads from two competing department stores.andP;  Those needs can beaccommodated through manual overrides.andP;  Ads can bc moved manually by pickingthem up from the page display and selecting a new page or position.andP;  Adsplaced manually snap to column grids.andM;Pages dummied in this fashion can be printed either as single pages on 8.5&quot; x11&quot; sheets or in reduced format to fit 12 pages on one sheet.andM;AdNet's management functions include facilities for calculating pricing bascdon an unlimited number of publications, page requests and rates, with extracharges for features, color or graphics; credit checking; invoice generationwith export to the accounts receivable program; and generation of a varietyof system reports (ad status, tearsheets, ad summaries, inserts) and salesreports (master list, account list, ad-taker list, expiration, payments,etc.).andM;Dummied pages can be exported to AdWorks to incorporate news stories.andM;AdWorks.andP;  The emphasis at the show was on using die bask AdWorks capabilitiesfor making up pages, but some new features have been added also.andP;  Therelease, that is scheduled for beta testing this month makes AdWorks muchmore complete both for ad work and for text applications.andP;  In the formercategory are rotation of text and graphics (although rotated text currendyisn't displayed rotated), arrowheads, customizable grids and rulers, theability to send one element to the back or front with respect to another, andmore flexibility in scaling graphics (scale them visually or by percentage).andO;Graphics also can be cropped by placing other objects partially on top ofdiem, creating interesting visual effects.andM;To aid in text work are a spelling checker to check an entire file or aselected portion of a file, tabular 'composition (with decimal alignment),indent commands (paragraph and hanging indents), greater flexibility inleading (automatic paragraph leading, interline leading based on point sizeor fixed values, etc.), vertical justification between lines of text oraround elements (this wasn't shown), and a search/replace routine that looksquite comprehensive.andP;  It accommodates whole word searches, case-sensitive orinsensitive searches (with the ability to retain the case or not), global ordiscretionary replacement, and combinations of sizes and fonts as part of thesearch and replace arguments (e.g., change all 10-point Helvetica text to12-point Times).andM;One other useful addition is an &quot;excess text&quot; handle to be used in cuttingtext that doesn't fit in a container and moving it to another container.andM;Also new is support for five-level hyphenation using the capabilitiessupplied by Circle Noetics.andP;  Coming later are manual keming and tracking.andM;Color support was demonstrated at the Seybold Seminars in March (see Vol.andP;  18No.andP;  13, pp.andP;  25-26) .andM;To use AdWorks for page layout, the operator imports the page dummy fromAdNet II.andP;  Already included on the page are elements from the template-pagenumbers, column widths, etc.-plus the ad layout.andP;  Actual ads created withinAdWorks can be brought onto the page and fixed in place.andM;To place stories in the text area, the operator has the full use of AdWorksfunctions-creating containers and flowing text in, picking up elements andmoving diem, rulers and grids to use as guides, the ability to flow textaround irregular shapes, etc.andP;  But there are no facilities for handling jumpstories, aside from the standard manual breaking and resuming, such as withthe new &quot;text handle.&quot; This makes the program's value for page layoutdependent on die specific application.andP;  Where stories are moved around a loton the same page, but where they aren't continued on later pages, it shouldwork reasonably well.andM;ClassWorks.andP;  Concept demonstrated a new version of ClassWorks that supportsmultiuser fimctionality.andP;  It requires an SE/ 30 or Mac II with 4 MB of memoryfor database functions.andP;  It still has a speed problem resulting from theslowness of its 4th Dimension database software, but a new release of 4thDimension is promised to alleviate the lethargy.andM;ClassWorks supports password protection; an unlimited number of publications(and classifications, rates, accounts and ads); ad access based on thecustomer's name, phone number or account number; scheduling by typing in thestarting and ending dates, not by calling up a calendar; and pulldown menusfor selecting certain items, such as publications or preprogrammed cities.andM;Text is typed into the ad on a separate screen, which in some cases is aninconvenience because the ad form is no longer visible.andP;  But customerinformation from the ad form can be inserted by command into the text of thead.andP;  The handamp;j program is the same as is used in AdWorks.andP;  Prompts for use byad takers in &quot;upselling&quot; the ad will be supported, with Concept supplyingsome prompts and the user adding others as desired.andM;Ads are sorted for publication alphabeticatly, by size, by keyword, etc.andM;The system's ad management facilities report the productivity of each adtaker, displayed as statistics and on a graph.andM;EPI paginating classified adsandM;The Electronic Publisher is continuing its move from being just an integratorof Macintosh products to being a full system developer that integrates otherproducts where necessary.andP;  In the past year, the company has moved to makesubstantial use of the Acius 4th Dimension database software on theMacintosh, and to use Quark Xtensions to link the different system elementsinto Quark Xpress.andM;The new items of particular interest concerned the links via Xtensions fromthe Electronic Publisher Classifier Omnis classified booking system directlyinto Xpress so dassified ads automatically flow into columns set up in Quarkusing Xpress composition.andP;  Last year composition was in galley mode onlyusing JustText.andM;4th Dimension is being used to build a sophisticated story routing system anda page planning system.andP;  The system currendy runs under Tops.andP;  The keyelement of this new routing and planning system, called DataPage, is writtenusing 4th Dimension as a page planning system.andP;  Page dummies are created withdie usual boxed areas as columns for text, ads and graphics.andP;  These arelinked into the database by defining which elements are to be located inspecific positions.andP;  DataPage allows areas or pages to be allocated tospecific users or groups of users on the network, with access limited only tothese defined users.andM;The system is linked via Quark Xtensions into Xpress so it is possible tolaunch a page from within DataPage, which opens the defined page withinXpress and finds the specific articles, ads and graphics from die database.andO;If they are not completed, it wiU report on what is not available, so it actsas a page tracking system as weU.andM;DataPage costs $4,000 for up to three users, with a cost of $500 peradditional user.andP;  The concept of DataPage looked interesting, and while it isnot complete yet, it looks like a promising tool for page design, managementof data, and scheduling.andM;GBT shows new editorandM;ANPA was a major show for GB Techniques in its attempt to break into theAmerican market.andP;  It brought several interesting new facilities, includingthe Advance display ad system (covered under CyberVision in our section on&quot;Display ads-) that was fully integrated into the dassified ad bookingsystem.andP;  There were major changes in the terminal and keyboard for the PCsystem and an editing program being shown in its early form to certaincustomers.'andM;GB's classified ad system was attracting a lot of attention, as was the closeintegration of Information Engineering's PC Page (PC News Layout) into thesystem.andM;One weakness of many PC-based systems is that die text editor, while havingexcellent text editing functionality, often lacks the powerful facilities forformatting and composition controls of the established, large-scale,third-wave systems.andP;  GBT is in the processes of implementing a new codelesseditor that is driven fully from formats accessed by single keys.andM;It also is adding an extended composition language that closely resembles instructure the programmable composition language of Atex.andP;  It features sixsystem variables for point size, leading, measure, font, horizontal andvertical position, and it also has 20 user variables in which basicmathematics can be carried out.andP;  These system and user variables can beembedded in formats, so it is easy to test for specific attributes orpositions on a page and proceed accordingly.andM;In a sense, this is likely to be more powerful and more interactive than thecorresponding Atex facility because it works within GB's interactivecomposition in the terminal.andP;  Incidentally, the similarity with Atex is notunintentional; the new codeless editor was developed with substantial inputfrom a major Atex user.andM;The powerful formatting capabilities permit nesting to four levels, jumpingdirecdy to any merge point at any level, and linking formats with definedscreen modes.andM;Another change brings strong support for color monitors, with color used toshow modes of operation.andP;  GB, which for a long time manufactured its ownkeyboards, has stopped doing this in favor of offering four differentkeyboards, including a basic IBM PC board and GB's own special keyboard thathas an IBM 3270 layout for the main area, plus additional keybanks at theleft, right and top.andP;  The keyboard is totally programmable; each logon canload a different layout.andM;For the first time, the keyboard now supports single-key functions, includinghandamp;j run interactively or in batch mode -and a new function to un-handamp;j a story.andO;In the near future, the new editor will allow Atex-like single-keydefine/operate modes, at which time &quot;spot handamp;j&quot; will be possible (selectivelyhandamp;j small elements such as a paragraph).andM;Evidence of the move to a true editorial system from a modified productionsystem wiU also be provided by the ability to toggle on and off thetypographic control information that is shown at the bottom of the screen.andM;Another major change is that the keyboard is now fully MS-DOS compatible sothere is no problem with software incompatibility.andP;  One of the first benefitsof this win be implementation of the Microlytics thesaurus in the nearfuture.andM;Classified ads.andP;  We looked at the new classified ad program that is in use ata number of UK sites, die largest of which supports more than 60 terminals.andO;The screen layout is programmable and can be made up using any of the 85system fields that are available, Any field on the form can be specified asmandatory or voluntary, and any field can be used to build a report.andP;  A rangeof standard reports are available, as is the ability to modify them or buildnew ones.andM;We were impressed with the functionality of the system and its ability tobook ads using codes, via the calendar or both.andP;  We didn't have a chance tosee how easy or fast it was to handle corrections, stops or deletions, andhow long it took to sort and output sections.andM;One weakness of the ad system is that a user has to know the typographiccommands to handle classified semi-display ads.andP;  The preview is built veryquickly, however, which alleviates this problem somewhat.andP;  The new codelesseditor will be a major improvement in this area also, as it will mean adtakers only need to use formats and break keys.andM;The system is expected to go into testing within 6 to 8 weeks, and to beavailable by November.andP;  It will be a free upgrade to existing customers.andM;There are still certain things we would like to see on thc system.andP;  Forexample, there are no prompts for &quot;up-selling&quot; by putting suggestions forselling additional insertions.andP;  The sales prompting is also very limited andreally of little use.andM;However, the linkages between the ad system and the new Advance display adterminal are good, and with a suitably configured terminal and the correctscreen controller, it is easy to switch between ad taking and display admode.andM;GB's integration of PC Page with the editorial system is very good.andP;  Thecurrent task is to add a link to ad dummy generation programs such asLayout-8000 or Newspaper Software Planner 3000, which is scheduled to be doneby the end of the year, at which time the picture placement and viewingfacility of PC Page also will be ready.andM;For classified pagination, GB is considering integrating some of the PC Pageproduct and its development to produce a full classified pagination solution.andM;Graph-X shows editorial systemandM;Graph-X has been a dealer of G.O.andP;  Graphics and Bestinfo software, as well asa developer of custom software.andP;  We saw an embrionic version of its PC-basedNewsmaker editorial system at America East last March.andP;  Since then, thesystem has progressed, with beta testing scheduled to start soon, we weretold.andP;  But it is still too early to give it a full evaluation.andM;The design philosophy of Newsmaker was to create a system that would be easyto use and friendly to reporters, rather than to give &quot;power users&quot; virtuallyunlimited functionality.andP;  It features a home-grown editing program, astraightforward menu system for implementing commands, interactive countingusing a monospaced display, and a soft-copy preview.andM;Graph-X has already completed a classified ad package, and it is developingits own program for creating display ads.andP;  For page layout, it plans to usethe Typecasts software from Unified Technologies.andM;The editing software is easier to use than XyWrite, but it also lacks some ofthe functionality of the Xyquest product, partly in the area ofprogrammability and partly in ordinary operations.andP;  It supports bothsplit-screen and altemate screen functions, a Random House thesaurus andspelling checker (batch or interactive), and search/replace capabilities.andO;But it lacks XyWrite's nice functionality in carrying out block operations.andO;With Newsmaker, defining blocks requires marking die beginning of the block,moving die cursor to die end of die block and marking that point to completethe definition; it lacks single-keystroke functions for selecting or deletingblocks.andM;The coding conventions are not unlike XyWrites.andP;  Codes arc typed at thecursor location in text, but rather than display them, the system uses asmall diamond to represent the commands.andP;  Where XyWrite uses an exploded modeto display (and edit) commands throughout the text, Newsmaker displays thecommands on a status line, representing only the commands currently under thecursor.andM;Menus guide the operator through most functions: specifying the number ofcolumns a story will fill, calling up or deleting stories, moving a block,changing typesetting parameters (size, font, etc.), and so on.andM;File functions offer an easy means of sorting directories alphabetically, bydate of creation (last in/first out), by size (shortest first) and by status(new files, approved files, stories on hold, etc.).andP;  The user can customizethe status setup.andP;  The directory displays the file name, description, length(in characters, words, inches, picas or points), author, editor, and so on.andM;Routing stories from one desk to another hasn't been implemented yet.andM;There is a headfit routine based on stored formats that reports the amount ofspace a head will take.andM;Output devices supported include PostScript, Compugraphic and Linotypemachines.andM;Adtaker.andP;  The classified system, called Adtaker, runs on the same NoveUnetwork as Newsmaker, with redundant storage available.andP;  Like the editorialsystem, it uses menus and dialog boxes to select alternatives, includingtypographic parameters for the text of each ad.andP;  It features automatic creditchecking based on phone number, automatic filling in of the city/state/ zipcode based on the telephone number entered on the form, support for up to 99publications, popup calendar for scheduling, 99 ad categories, 99 storedformats for composing ads, interactive handamp;j of ad text using the same handamp;jprogram as the editorial system, spelling checker, six user-definablereports, popup window for selecting payments, display of ad pricing on diescreen, and so on.andM;Adtaker was developed before Newsmaker and already has been installed ininitial customer sites.andM;IEA, Ultra cooperate on systemandM;Information Engineering, best known for its PC News Layout product, isputting together a system to satisfy most requirements of small andmedium-sized newspapers.andP;  Besides the layout package, it includes an editingprogram using XyWrite, a composition capability based on a relativelystandard command language, a wire service input program developed by IEA, aninterface to Archetype Designer for WYSIWYG display and modification ofpages, and the Infosel/Infodex storage and retrieval system.andP;  The editingprogram, called TBase, provides customizable file headers and flexibleselective directories.andM;An interface to Layout-8000 for ad dummying has been developed.andP;  The systemdoesn't include facilities for handling classified ads.andM;In addition to offering its products for use as an integral system,Information Engineering and its distributors sell them as add-ons to othervendors' systems.andM;At the show, Information Engineering was providing space for two of itsdistributors: one for Latin America and one for Spain.andP;  Some of thedevelopments on display had been accomplished by the distributors, UltraCorp., of Miami, which sells a Spanish version of the system, and SEI, ofSpain, which had worked on parts of the packages.andM;As we have reported before, PC News Layout uses a page grid and command areato lay out news stories.andP;  It displays lists of stories assigned to pages,errors such as short pages, customizable layout specifications such as howmany points of space should separate a photograph from a caption, and so on.andO;A graphic representation of each page can be printed out, as can thespecifications for each page.andP;  Copyfitting and page assembly formats aregenerated automatically.andM;A new feature developed in Spain reports the production status of all pagesor individual pages, based on the author's specifying the edition to whicheach story will be assigned.andP;  The status report indicates which articles aremissing from a page, which articles have been handamp;j'ed successfully, which oneshave been approved for printing but can still be changed if necessary, andwhich ones can no longer be changed.andP;  One thing we noticed that should bechanged is that after the &quot;handamp;j'ed, fits&quot; status has been granted to a story,it isn't updated if further changes are made, perhaps invalidating thestatus.andP;  Ultra and SEI stated that they will fix this discrepancy,andM;UltraEdit.andP;  Ultra has done a nice job with its Spanish editing program, whichstarts with XyWrite and provides an interface to PC News Layout.andP;  It supportsuser logons to track die author of the story, who specifies the edition thestory wiU appear in.andP;  As text is typed using the Spanish XyWrite, a copydepth estimate is provided based on line length.andP;  But when the story ishandamp;j'ed, it uses the page geometry of the layout to provide exact handamp;j results.andO;After handamp;j, the screen indicates how many lines long or short the story is,what headlines or cutlines may be needed, and where column breaksoccur-enough infbffnation to enable the author to complete the storysuccessfully.andM;Hyphenation is based on an algorithm provided by SEI and an exceptiondictionary.andM;UltraEdit requires a '286 PC or better for the PC News Layout station and anyPC for a reporter's terminal.andP;  It supports PostScript, Monotype and Coraoutput devices.andM;SEI has instaUed the UltraEdit and PC News Layout system at two newspapers inSpain.andP;  Ultra is currendy installing its first Latin American site inVenezuela.andP;  SEI and Information Engineering have also developed and installedinterfaces for Atex and other third- party systems.andP;  Ultra is also offeringthese interfaces to Latin American newspapers.andM;Ultra says it is working on an interface to Atex systems.andP;  Ultra alsodemonstrated a customized Spanish version of the Computer Peripheral Sciences(CPS) ClassAd program.andP;  IEA is not offering this program in English.andP;  Afterthe ads are taken, they are sent to a module that sorts them by category andexecutes handamp;j based on the same algorithm used by UltraEdit.andP;  The module thenplaces the ads on the page assigned to them, utilizing the page geometrycreated by PC news Layout.andP;  This in effect is a form of classifiedpagination.andP;  The InfoDex Data Management System was also demonstrated byUltra.andM;Composition.andP;  Information Engineering's composition program, FDP/2, wasoriginally developed for the Autologic family of typesetters but has beenextended to include laser printer drivers and other typesetters.andP;  It includesan elaborate set of composition commands, including provisions for testingconditional statements, multilevel nesting of stored formats, access tosystem and user variables, event processing to cause certain things to happenat any specified depth or other typographic event, and so on.andM;The list of commands is 106 items long, many of them similar to the commandsets used by major vendors.andM;Composition takes place in the PC.andM;FDP/2 is used as the primary composition module for the TBase editing programsold by Information Engineering.andP;  It is available also as a separate task ina multitasking environment and as a standalone program run at the DOS commandlevel or on a network.andP;  With TBase, it can drive Autologic APS, Lasercomp,Cora and PostScript machines.andM;We didn't have a chance to spend much time with FDP/2, so we'll report moreat the next opportunity.andM;Graphics.andP;  In the area of graphics, PC News Layout has added the ability todisplay low-resolution versions of scanned graphics on page layouts.andO;Photographs can be cropped and sized on the page.andP;  PCX graphics can beimported; TIFF will be added next, followed by wirephoto and EncapsulatedPostScript formats.andP;  The development is part of a cooperative alliance withDrane Associates and a startup company involved in image processing and datacompression.andP;  Not surprisingly, the Drane is none other than Doug, cofounderof Atex.andM;Pages with graphics can be output to a variety of frontend systems, includingAtex, Crosfield, IEA's FDP/2, Archetype Designer and XyWrite.andM;Archetype interface.andP;  Page geometry and graphics from PC News Layout can besent to Archetype's Designer workstation, which is used for page assembly andpreview.andP;  Here, text can be displayed as actual or greeked characters andgraphics can be displayed on the page.andM;Because editing and scrolling on the page are quite slow, they arerecommended only for minor, last-minute changes.andP;  Most changes and allcopyfitting can be done within TBase.andM;The deal between Archetype and IEA includes Archetype's Network Agent inaddition to Designer software.andP;  This means that Network Agent's databasefacilities can be used to store high-resolution graphics and to transmitlow-resolution view files for display within Designer.andM;WireBase.andP;  The new WireBase program supports capture of one to eight incomingchannels.andP;  Dual PCs can be used for redundant storage.andP;  A programmable sonicalert can be tied to priority levels, keywords and topics, with an option ofprinting stories automatically based on the alert.andM;Stored header data and the lead paragraph of the story can be entered direcdyinto a relational database, where they can be queried by the user.andM;The TBase screen shows the wire service header and the first four lines ofeach story.andP;  When a story is called up, thc system automatically goes intothe TBase editor.andM;As with its other products, IEA is promoting WireBase for other applicationin addition to its own system.andP;  In particular, it suggests using it to store,process and forward stories to buffer communications loads for traditionalfront-end systems.andM;Pricing hasn't been set yet; it wiU be based on the number of ports required,whether die system is networked, and so on.andP;  First installations arescheduled for September.andM;LaserMaker layout system readyandM;LaserMaker was ready for the first customer for its layoutbased program tobegin five production.andP;  The customer is Transport Week, in the UK, whereLaserMaker has its head office.andP;  The system is driving a Varityper 4300 laserimagesetter.andM;Another key customer will be the first U.S.andP;  site to get the layoutfunctionality: Home News, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which will use DECword processors and four PS/2s with Moniterm Viking monitors for theLaserMaker layout product, scheduled to be instaUed in August.andM;LaserMaker showed a couple of enhancements to its layout software.andP;  One ofthem enables vertical justification within single-column boxes, adding spacebetween lines or paragraphs.andP;  Another addition relates to overmatter when alayout box is filled before copy is used up.andP;  When this happens, text in thetext window is underlined, and a marker appears in the layout box.andM;LaserMaker also is supporting input of EPS files from Macintoshes.andM;We were advised that LaserMaker is about to change its product naming.andP;  Theoriginal product, which provides full composition capabilities but notgraphic layout, will be called LM Type.andP;  The layout version, originallycalled the LaserMaker Editorial and Production System, will be called LMPage.andM;With its own editorial and layout program, LaserMaker has been looking toAdvent to supply it with a display ad creation system.andM;The company has hired Hans-Peter Brammer as director of sales and marketingfor Europe.andM;Mycro-Tek: ad dummies, paginationandM;In keeping with one of die themes of the show, Mycro-Tek added two moremodules to its growing system.andP;  It demonstrated MasterPlanner ad dummysoftware running on a PC and announced plans to employ the Mac-bases QuarkXpress for pagination.andP;  It also introduced some new svstem hardware andenhancements to its classified ad program.andP;  The result, when it is completed,will give Mycro-Tek a system providing editorial and classified software on aPC, AdWriter for creating ads on a Mac, MasterPlanner for placing ads onpages, and Xpress for producing whole pages.andM;New system hardware.andP;  Mycro-Tek introduced its 3500 system, which isbasically a lower-end version of the 4000 system introduced last year.andP;  It isbased on a 68020 main processor and a 68010 input/output processor.andP;  Itprovides the same general capabilities as the 4000, including multitasking,support for all current Mycro-Tek terminals and typesetter interfaces, andthe MycroLink to the Macintosh.andP;  But it accommodates a maximum of 24 ports.andM;The 3500, which effectively replaces the 3000, comes with 4 MB of RAM and two50-MB SCSI disk drives (usable storage), or as an option two 90-MB disks,which provide mirror writing for data redundancy.andP;  The 3500 is upgradable tothe 4000.andM;The 3500 sells for $28,350 with 16-port capacity.andP;  It runs standard DBvistadatabase software.andM;Advertising enhancements.andP;  The ACE program (Advertising and ClassifiedEnhancements) adds some key features not previously offered for classifiedand display ad input.andP;  It is being sold as an option for customers with '286PCs, EGA displays and 3500 or 4000 servers.andM;We won't try to mention all of the new features, but they include provisionfor three levels of security, system-assigned unique ad numbers and time/datestamps, saving of the last eight activities performed on each file as historyfiles, and a credit card field with a system check to see if the card numberis valid.andM;Rate handling is more flexible, providing fields for taxes, customizablepackages and discounts.andP;  Pricing can be tied to customer type and be based ondepth, number of words, etc.andP;  The number of publications that can beaccommodated has been increased from 21 to 32.andM;Calendar scheduling runs up to 90 days ahead, permitting the ad taker tospecify the start/stop dates, or the number of days the ad will run, or justtick the days on the calendar--or remove skip days from the calendar.andM;For display ads, a form is available for entering data in a manner similar tothat for classified ads.andP;  In addition, there are fields for requested pages,logos, color, coupons, versions and special charges.andM;ACE uses a 24-line x 80-character display rather than the 16-line x64-character display that is standard with other Mycro-Tek products.andM;One key to ACE is that it ties in nicely with MasterPlanner.andP;  Informationrelating to ad placement, coupons, and so on is passed to MasterPlanner foruse in preparing page dummies.andM;Mycro-Tek also offers a billing and reports package.andM;MasterPlanner.andP;  The MasterPlanner ad dummying program was developed in the UKby Agefame and is being used by the London Evening Standard, as we reportedin discussing the Digital Technology system installed there.andP;  In the U.S., itis being sold in the newspaper market by Mycro-Tek and in the magazine marketby the Media Services Group, of Stamford, CT.andM;Mycro-Tek is selling MasterPlanner as a standalone package.andP;  To runinteractively on the system, it requires the ACE interface, which issupported only on 3500 and 4000 systems.andM;When the integration is complete, ads composed with AdWriter software will beallocated space on the page during the dummying process, after which thecontents of the ads will be available for full-page output using Quark Xpressas a pagination tool.andM;MasterPlanner runs on an IBM PC with a color monitor and a mouse.andP;  Itprovides good facilities for automatic placement of ads and for manualoverrides where desired.andP;  It also includes a program for reporting pageimposition status for saddle-stitched or perfect-bound publications.andM;Mycro-Tek is selling MasterPlanner for $7,500.andP;  The ACE interface costs $1,500.andP;  (See The Latest Word for more information about how MasterPlanner worksand about the Media Services Group, which also sells it in the U.S)andM;Paginating with Quark.andP;  Mycro-Tek didn't demonstrate anything in the ,area offull pagination, but it showed a diagram of how it will incorporateextensions to Quark Xpress for use as a pagination system.andP;  It will use aninterface to die MycroTek system similar to the MycroLink interface used withAdWriter.andP;  This permits the user at the Macintosh to view directories ofstories on the system disk and to call for them as needed.andP;  It is a two-wayinterface, enabling page geometry from Quark to be available to users atMycro-Tek workstations, although it isn't clear yet precisely how this willwork.andP;  If MasterPlanner software is running on the system, ad dummies wiU beavailable to Quark.andM;Macintoshes can be connected directly to the system server, not requiring aMacintosh server.andM;Mycro-Tek hopes to show its pagination product this fall.andM;One-for-One attacks class adsandM;One-for-One showed its Optimum pagination system, based on the Versacomplanguage, for preparing classified advertising pages, which are unlike thebulk of the newspaper in that they are highly structured.andP;  Versacomp is ahigh-level procedure-oriented programming language with a powerful set ofcommands for I/O operations, data manipulation, composition and page-buildingtasks.andM;Any text editor can be used with the system, although XyWrite is recommendedfor the PC version.andP;  The system also runs on the Sun386i.andP;  The software islicensed from Pagetech Inc., but One-for-One sells the complete system.andP;  Thisis effectively a database publishing tool, but it could be used as acomposition routine for financial reports, classified ads, sports and librarysystems.andM;One-for-One said it is currendy in discussion with one of its users to acceptdocuments mapped to SGML.andP;  Although this user doesn't produce a newspaper,thc project may turn up some interesting possibilities for newspaper users.andM;Rockwell expands product offeringandM;Last year at ANPA, we saw Rockwell Computer's impressive small system forhandling wire service input on a Macintosh.andP;  Also shown were simple editorialfeatures and the first stages of a classified ad system, which we criticized(perhaps prematurely) .andP;  This year, the classified program was moreimpressive.andM;Like some other smaller Macintosh developers, Rockwell is using Acius's 4thDimension database and Quark Xtensions to link into Xpress for compositionand page make-up.andM;Classified.andP;  The Classified Advertisement Solution, written in 4th Dimensionand Pascal, is a multi-publication, multiuser classified ad system thathandles ad booking, scheduling, charging, invoicing and all remainingbusiness functions.andP;  The database runs on a Macintosh II; ad entry stationscan employ Mac SEs or IIs with 2 MB of memory.andM;The second form handlesthe insertion patterns either with an insertion codeor through the use of calendars.andP;  It is not possible to set up illegal rundays.andM;The system, designed for up to ten ad entry stations, is simple to use butnonetheless appears to be reasonably comprehensive for small papers.andM;All pricing is done on a word-count basis, because there is no way to accessdie Xpress composition program during ad pricing.andM;If an ad is to be set up in a different fashion from the default for theclassification, typographic controls can be specified with the text when itis entered.andP;  Facilities for retrieving ads from the database are good; theyinclude searching for a specific field.andP;  The system supports file locking toprevent dual access to an ad.andM;As the wire service system has grown into the editorial solution, it has beenrewritten to increase its speed.andP;  It has a basic text editor and accesses aspelling checker and thesaurus.andM;Copy routing is reasonably simple, supporting the requirements of smallnewspapers.andP;  The editorial module can be rim together with Xpress underMultiFinder for quick access to composition.andM;Photo management.andP;  The other product demonstrated by Rockwell required moreoriginality than the others.andP;  Also using 4th Dimension, it is the PhotoManagement Solution, designed for assigning work to photographers and formanaging their time.andM;The Photo Management Solution starts with assignment sheets printed out todefine a photographer's tasks.andP;  When photos have been taken, each one islogged into the database by roll and shot number.andP;  This enables fullretrieval at any time and under various search categories of all negativesthat are stored in the newspaper.andM;Synaptic ready for Advent dealandM;Although we had expected completion earlier of a deal to bring the Adventpagination and display ad capabilities to Synaptic Micro Solution, it hasbeen held up, probably by termination of an earlier Advent pact rather thanby complications with the Synaptic one.andP;  But Synaptic is ready to take overthe rights to the software in the U.S.andP;  newspaper market, where it willinterface it to the Synaptic editorial and dassified program.andM;After the deal is completed and the products are properly integrated,Synaptic should have one of the most complete small systems on the market.andO;Its SunType editorial system is flexible (although no longer based onXyWrite).andP;  Its SunType.andP;  dassified system ctsrobably has been installed inmore newspaper sites than any other PC-based classified system.andP;  Advent's 3B2will be used for display ad creation and pagination.andM;Synaptic already has demonstrated the ability to bring SunType files into 3B2and flow them onto pages, but other aspects of the interface and plannedrefinements to the ftmctionality haven't been made public.andM;At ANPA, Synaptic showed or announced a few items of news, including thecompletion of its Novell network version and a contract with the ScrippsLeague newspapers under which Scripps League will put the SunType classifiedprogram in 22 of its papers.andM;The SunType editing program is now based on Borland's Sprint word processorrather than on XyWrite (Sprint is more programmable, we were told).andP;  Minorenhancements indude the ability to suppress the function key labels on thebottom of the screen to enlarge the working area.andP;  Also new is the ability tosave the current directory display as part of a user's logon information.andM;For the classified program, Synaptic has added editionsensitive pricing aspart of a more powerful rating fimction.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
