The fires, fueled by drought, were among blazes burning in eightWestern and Midwestern states, where tens of thousands of acres offorest, brush and meadow have gone up in smoke. The other stateswith major fires are Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington andIdaho, where a 1,500-acre blaze forced two dozen people from theirhomes.   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel planned a helicopter tour ofYellowstone for this afternoon to survey the devastation inAmerica's oldest national park.   Hodel was to visit Yellowstone's Grant Village section, scene ofsome of this week's heaviest firefighting.   Firefighters also kept watch on a 6,000-acre blaze burning sixto 10 miles west of Old Faithful. The blaze posed no immediatethreat to the famed geyser, but officials planned to usehelicopters today to start backfires with a napalm-like substanceto slow its advance.   The fire in Rapid City was reported Tuesday afternoon, andrapidly consumed 1,800 acres of forest and meadow in thesouthwestern South Dakota area that's home to 90,000 people.   ``There were areas where you might have a hundred acres go up atonce,'' said Rich Homann, another fire spokesman.   One firefighter was treated for burns to the neck, a firefighterand a resident suffered smoke inhalation, and another resident washurt in a smoke-caused traffic accident, but none of the injurieswas serious, Newman said. The fire also burned four vehicles anddestroyed a bridge.   Crews made progress overnight and more than 500 firefighterswere on the scene this morning, fire officials said.   Four helicopters and an airplane dropped water and fireretardant to protect homes.   By early today, the fire was 50 percent contained despite lightwind, Newman said.   ``The problem with a fire this size and this severe is that itcreates its own weather to some degree. It creates its own wind bysucking in oxygen,'' he said.   To make matters worse, winds were expected to pick up today,temperatures were expected to reach almost 90 degrees and no rainwas forecast.   Most of the evacuees in Rapid City found lodging with friendsand relatives, said Lyle Baker of the American Red Cross. About 60families responded to a Red Cross appeal for people to open theirhomes to evacuees, Baker said.   ``We're spending more time now coordinating between familymembers to let people know where they're staying,'' he said. Somefamily members were separated in the confusion of the evacuation.   At Yellowstone, about 500 firefighters remained on the linesnear Grant Village, a camping and store complex about 15 milessoutheast of Old Faithful that was evacuated last weekend. Firealso closed the road from the village to the park's southernentrance and closed the Lewis Lake campground.   It was expected to take a couple more days to finish off the10,000-acre Grant Village blaze, said Joan Anzelmo, a parkspokeswoman.   The fire is the only one of 13 fires being actively foughtwithin park boundaries. Two fires straddling the park and adjacentnational forests are being suppressed from the forest side only,officials said.   Park policy is to fight natural forest fires only if theythreaten people or structures.   In all, about 83,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres havebeen blackened. Unusually hot, dry conditions this summer have leftYellowstone and the rest of northwestern Wyoming tinder-box dry.   ``The last time they had this much fire in the park was in thelate 1800s,'' said Larry Caplinger, a Forest Service officialcoordinating firefighting.</TEXT></DOC>
