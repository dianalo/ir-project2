The measure's estimated cost is $800 million, the highest figurein the agency's history, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reportedtoday.   The regulations are needed because a ``cavalier attitude''toward infections is increasing the danger of sickness and deathamong health workers, said Dr. Joseph H. Coggin Jr., a consultantto OSHA.   An estimated 5.3 million nurses, police officers, ambulancedrivers, embalmers, firefighters and prison guards would be coveredby the regulations.   ``In spite of a barrage of literature about the modern dangersof laboratory-acquired infections and how to prevent them, workersin the average laboratory today fail to faithfully wear protectiveclothing, gloves and face shields,'' said Coggin, head of theDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology at the University ofSouth Alabama medical school in Mobile.   Coggin said he witnessed incidents in which employees' luncheswere kept in a refrigerator along with AIDS-infected blood samples,a surgical assistant used a hallway telephone while wearingblood-soaked gloves and janitors removed biohazardous waste inunprotected street clothes.   ``Most of these workers recognize the potential danger and evenlethal outcomes of a laboratory exposure to blood-borne viruses andagents but yield to the pressure of getting the work donequickly,'' Coggin said.   Most health workers, Coggin said, appear to be unaware ofvoluntary guidelines that the national Centers for Disease Controlin Atlanta has suggested for handling contaminated blood.   He said that without the required actions, workers inlaboratories, hospitals and research centers ``will continue tohave infectious disease transmitted needlessly through blood andhuman materials in the workplace.''   The CDC has reported 18 cases of infection with HIV, the virusthat can cause AIDS, as a result of workplace exposure, and anestimated 12,000 health-care workers now contract hepatitis B everyyear because of occupational exposure.   According to the newspaper, OSHA has proposed requiring:   _Gloves, face shields, gowns, fluid-resistant clothing and otherequipment for any workers who might be exposed to potentiallyinfectious materials.   _Employer-paid vaccinations of all employees whose jobs exposedthem to hepatitis B, as well as follow-up examinations and bloodtests after exposure incidents.   _Safety features such as double doors, easily washed surfaces,areas for decontamination and sinks for washing in work areas wherehepatitis B or the AIDS virus is produced for research purposes.   Any rules formulated by OSHA must be approved by the federalOffice of Management and Budget.</TEXT></DOC>
