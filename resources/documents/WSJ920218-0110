The Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, which met hereover the weekend, warned that the current gap betweenlong-term and short-term interest rates &quot;offers banks anapparent opportunity to gain by borrowing short and lendinglong, substantially increasing their vulnerability to lossesfrom future increases in rates.&quot; Interest rates on 30-yearTreasury bonds currently are about twice the rates onshort-term Treasury bills.</LP><TEXT>   Franco Modigliani, a Nobel laureate from the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, told the group that the sharp,upward slope in the yield curve means that financial marketsbelieve that short-term rates will rise, which would squeezebank profits on fixed-rate, long-term loans.   In a statement, the panel said &quot;the collapse of the thriftindustry is due to the industry's longstanding exposure tointerest-rate risk&quot; and banks could face a similar plightunless they hedge against interest-rate risk.   The group, which is comprised primarily of free-marketacademics, castigated federal banking regulators for failingto adopt more detailed interest-rate risk protections.Regulators will be blamed if bank failures &quot;impose additionallosses on the taxpayer,&quot; the group said. Agencies have beentrying to address the complex issue of interest-rate risk forsome time.   The panel also criticized the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.'s recent decision to take over CrossLand Savings FSB,New York. &quot;Taxpayers are apt to lose when regulators gamblethat the government can efficiently nurse an insolvententerprise back to health,&quot; the group said in its statement.Banking committees in the House and Senate are investigatingthe $1.2 billion CrossLand takeover.</TEXT></DOC>
