President Reagan altered the political landscape last week by reversing himself and agreeing to consider a tax increase to reduce the federal budget deficit. Some GOP presidential candidates will continue to oppose new taxes.    But the president's change of heart, which was forced on him by last week's stock market crash, might cause particular problems for his vice president, who just two weeks ago, in his announcement speech for his own presidential candidacy, pledged that he is &quot;not going to raise your taxes -- period.&quot;    Mr. Bush may also encounter trouble over another tax position, a commitment to lower the tax on capital gains, although probably not in the conservative crowd at tonight's debate. Critics of the idea say a cut in the capital-gains tax would be a sop to the wealthy, would lose revenue and would unravel one of his president's chief accomplishments, last year's historic tax overhaul whose centerpiece was a reduction in tax rates for individuals.    &quot;It's a fundamental assault on the Tax Reform Act of 1986,&quot; says Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), one of the act's chief architects. &quot;The agreement of tax reform is that you got much lower tax rates for giving up (tax preferences such as) the capital-gains exclusion.&quot; Lowering the tax on capital gains, Sen. Bradley charges, &quot;is a recipe for higher individual tax rates.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Bush says cutting the capital-gains rate to 15% from the current rate of 28% would raise revenue and stimulate economic growth. And, despite President Reagan's reversal, aides insist, Mr. Bush is standing firm on his refusal to accept a tax increase as a way to reduce the burgeoning budget deficit.    These positions have far-reaching political implications, especially as the GOP candidates try to appeal to conservatives. &quot;If Bush holds firm, it's a clear way to gain stature,&quot; says Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and leading supply-sider. &quot;It separates him from the president, and it's a net gain for George Bush.&quot;    But Mr. Bush's adamant no-tax-increase stand may be at odds with a growing consensus among the public. &quot;It's a myth to think that the public out there is just livid at the thought of a revenue component of a deficit reduction plan, that's a total mistake,&quot; says GOP analyst Kevin Phillips. &quot;That consensus has been incipient since the 1986 elections.    &quot;The president has sandbagged the Republican Party's fiscal strategists for years,&quot; he adds. &quot;They haven't been able to plan on new revenue approaches. He has been recalcitrant, and we have paid the price for it.&quot;    &quot;The president is making it more difficult for them (GOP presidential candidates) by taking a more mainstream position,&quot; concurs Gregory Schneiders, a Democratic consultant doing work for presidential candidate Bruce Babbitt of Arizona. &quot;They all have been squirming. Bush is the most uncomfortable among them.&quot;    Most of the Republican presidential candidates are sticking to their no-new-tax position, including Rep. Jack Kemp, Alexander Haig, Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont. Rep. Kemp, the supply-sider, says, &quot;If we learned anything from the Hoover years, it's that you don't raise taxes, close markets or tighten money in response to a stock crash.&quot; And even some who aren't supply-siders, such as Mr. Haig, agree: &quot;It beggars disbelief that tax increases are today's only answer.&quot;    But one Republican candidate who is privately sympathetic to a tax increase is Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole. Reducing the budget deficit has been a longtime goal of Mr. Dole, and he was criticized by some Republicans for championing tax increases in 1982 and 1984. &quot;Bob Dole got hit for it,&quot; Mr. Phillips says. &quot;But now he's going to look good for it.&quot;    Vice President Bush's hard-nosed stance against a tax increase places him in a tough spot. He insists that he will continue to be loyal to President Reagan, who is now moving toward accepting a tax increase, while at the same time refusing to accept one himself.    Mr. Bush's backing for a lower tax on capital gains also might prove controversial down the road. One of the fundamental provisions in the broad tax overhaul that Mr. Reagan supported last year was the phased elimination of the special low rate on gains from the sale of capital property, such as real estate and securities.    One particular problem for the vice president, who is fighting the perception that he is a preppy, is that the proposal's principal beneficiaries are the richest people in America. The latest figures from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation show that some 70% of the tax savings from the break goes to individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year; less than 3% goes to people earning less than $40,000.    In 1984, of the $168.6 billion earned by people with incomes over $200,000, 44%, or $74.3 billion, was derived from capital gains, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Indeed, the preference was ended in large measure because it was a central ingredient of tax shelters.    The crash of the stock market is giving advocates of cutting the gains rate a boost. Proponents argue that a lower rate could reverse the steep slide of the market, and also stimulate the economy at a time when some fear it may be falling toward recession. Some noted economists even believe that lowering the capital-gains rate would raise revenue because it would encourage more buying and selling of property.    But studies by government economists cast serious doubt on that idea. A 1985 study by the Reagan administration's own Treasury Department showed that the 1981 cut in the capital-gains tax cost the Treasury revenue. And a soon-to-be published study by the Congressional Budget Office is expected to show that Mr. Bush's plan to lower the rate to 15% also is a revenue loser.    ---           Who Benefits From Capital Gains   Projected 1987 distribution by income range ofcapital-gains tax preference that applied prior to 1986 taxlaw.
