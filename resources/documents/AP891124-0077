Animal rights activists planned nationwide protests against fursales. In Miami, workers at Grove Cleaners and Furriers arrivedtoday to find red and blue paint covering the front windows andgraffiti on a van parked out front.   A spokeswoman for the Animals Rights Foundation of Floridadenied responsibility for the vandalism.   Today's shopping spree followed a white Thanksgiving for manypeople in the East and South. The holiday was an occasion for theneedy to count life's few blessings in homeless shelters and soupkitchens around the nation.   Giving thanks was on the minds of thousands of victims ofHurricane Hugo, northern California's earthquake and other naturaldisasters that jolted the nation this year.   ``We are alive. We have more reasons to give thanks than we doto be sorry,'' said Mabel Martin, owner of a trailer park inAlorton in southern Illinois that was devastated by a Nov. 15 stormthat caused an estimated $5.3 million in damage.   The snow that fell from Virginia to New England canceled highschool football games in the Northeast, but neither a wascallywabbit who wouldn't waft nor a fallen Humpty Dumpty dampened thespirits of millions of parade watchers.   ``This is the snowiest Thanksgiving. Period,'' saidmeteorologist Harry Woodworth at the National Weather Service inNewark, N.J., where more than 5 inches of snow fell.   Up to 8 inches of snow fell in Massachusetts, and 5 inches wasreported at Snowshoe ski resort near Marlinton, W.Va. Baltimoreresidents woke up to their first white Thanksgiving since 1971.   The first Thanksgiving snow in New York since 1938 grounded theSnoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons from the 63rd Annual Macy'sThanksgiving Day Parade, but an estimated 1.8 million people stilllined the parade route.   ``I would have come out here even if it was 20 degrees belowfreezing. It's a million times better live,'' said 32-year-olt MikeKoleba, wrapped in an army jacket, two hats and a scarf.   The 70th annual Thanksgiving Day parade in Philadelphia surviveda record snowfall, but the 55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had agreat fall when it was punctured by a light standard.   Some 900,000 people braved temperatures in the 20s Thursday inDetroit to watch the 63rd Annual Michigan Thanksgiving Day Parade.   In an out-of-this-world meal, Discovery's astronauts celebratedin space with thermo-stabilized turkey, freeze-dried vegetables andcranberry sauce. Jyso????O??@? wife enjoyed a traditional Thanksgivingdinner that included roast turkey with stuffing and cranberrysauce, sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows, green beans, saladand pumpkin and pecan pies at the retreat in Camp David, Md.   Meanwhile, at a holiday feast at the Los Angeles Rescue Mission,actor Ben Vereen asked the president to do more for the homeless.   ``I will not pray for you,'' he told the mission diners. ``Iwill pray for the administration to do something for you.''   A laid-off bank president was among those served at a SalvationArmy center in Massachusetts, but it was the children who wereamong the victims of the state's slumping economy that most touchedthe hearts of volunteers.   ``They often wonder why they are going to this strange place,but when they're eating good food there is a real warm feeling forthe whole family to see,'' said Salvation Army spokesman StephenCopaccio.   A man in Woonsocket, R.I., helped the needy revel in thekindness of others after his ministry received 458 donated turkeys.Last week Paul Dempster, director of Because He Lives Ministries,had only three turkeys and a guest list of about 70 people.   He called friends, newspapers and radio stations looking formore.   ``I told them I needed help getting the word out,'' saidDempster. By Thursday morning he was inundated with 458 turkeys, hesaid.   In the San Francisco Bay area, many survivors of the Oct. 17quake gave thanks by serving holdiay meals to their less fortunateneighbors.   ``Here we can really give thanks and be grateful that we arestill here despite the destruction and death; this is a time whenwe can come together.'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of GlideMemorial United Methodist Church, where 6,000 people were treatedto dinner.   A killer tornado did not stop an Alabama couple from havingtheir planned Thanksgiving wedding. Wayne Stinson of Huntsvillesaid his wedding vows to Wanda Clark from a hospital bed, where hewas recovering from storm injuries.   ``y?hd be an e}date to remember,'' he said.   Three people rescued from a raft on 18-foot seas nearCharleston, S.C., were thankful to be alive as they ateThanksgiving Day dinner at the Coast Guard Air Station in Savannah,Ga.   The trio were tired but in good health after abandoning theirfloundering 43-foot boat and drifting in a raft for four hoursThursday about 35 miles southeast of Charleston, officials said.   Elsewhere, the chiefs of Virginia's eight Indian tribes were theguests of Gov. and Mrs. Gerald L.
