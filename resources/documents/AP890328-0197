(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal officials hailed a cashsettlement between the government and Unisys Corp. on fraudcharges, but the nation's second largest computer company said itfelt vindicated by the dismissal of charges.   U.S. Attorney James Wilson announced Monday that Unisys made a$700,000 payment to the government in return for federalauthorities throwing out the indictment.   The charges last October against Unisys and its predecessor,Sperry Corp., stemmed from a $526 million contract to upgrade theAir Force's worldwide computer system. It followed a four-yearinvestigation by authorities.   As part of the settlement, the company also agreed to abandon aclaim against the government by Sperry for more than $800,000 indisputed unpaid invoices, Wilson said.   ``We feel this is an overall victory, an outstanding victory,''he said about the settlement.   Convictions in the case would only have resulted in maximumfines of $50,000, Wilson said. He said the settlement was not anadmission of guilt on the part of the companies.   A spokesman for Unisys said the settlement was a ``businessdecision'' reached to avoid continuing litigation and the companycontinued to deny any wrongdoing. J. Peter Hynes said the dismissalof charges vindicates the company.   ``We have said all along that there was no criminalityinvolved,'' said Hynes in a telephone interview from the company'sBlue Bell, Pa., headquarters.   He said the settlement was ``just a convenience to get the wholesituation behind us and continue working with the Air Force, whichis a valuable customer.''   Unisys and Sperry were accused of overcharging the government in1983 for an unspecified portion of a $500,000 invoice involving thecomputer contract.   Unisys was formed as a result of a merger of Burroughs Corp. andSperry in September 1986.   Wilson said uncertainty about the criminal liability ofsuccessor corporations following mergers played a part in thegovernment choosing to settle. Government prosecutors appealedafter U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina dismissed the case againstUnisys in December because the company did not exist until 1986.   In the settlement filed March 21, Dubina's dismissal order wasthrown out as part of the legal work leading to the agreement todrop charges against both companies.   The death of a key government witness also was a factor indismissing the indictment, Wilson said.</TEXT></DOC>
