Some important players think they see signs of the weed again.   As in the past, there are many who see nothing wrong _ in thisinstance, with so-called program trading. Some of the most esteemednames in the industry defend the practice. The New York StockExchange accommodates program traders.   But there are others _ brokers, big investors, mutual funds,listed companies among them _ who are determined to uproot thepractice, saying it caters to privilege and in doing so destroyspublic confidence.   These are individuals and institutions with real clout, and theyaren't likely to back off. They are angry and determined.   Program trading takes various forms, but the most controversialis stock-index arbitrage trading, or short-term, computer-triggeredbuying or selling to exploit brief inconsistencies between pricesin spot and futures markets.   Because it is based on market mechanics rather than underlyingstock values, the strategy is called mindless. Mindless or not,some brokers play the game for their own accounts, regardless ofthe impact on their own customers. And, because the formula isshared, that impact can be explosive in either direction.   One of the latest to vent outrage is the investment managementfirm of Neuberger andamp; Berman, which took full-page newspaperadvertisements to demand an end to ``the numbers racket.''   Program trading, it said, serves no economic purpose ``except toline the pockets of a handful of institutions and individuals.''   In addition, it said, it causes mindless volatility, drivesindividual investors from the market, reduces stock values, and``mocks the fundamental truth that the price of a stock should bebased on its value.''   It is a type of insider trading, the company says, in which bigplayers, hooked up directly to the New York Stock Exchangecomputers, buy and sell on 5 percent margin while other investorsstand in line and must put up 50 percent.   ``In short, program trading is nothing more than a numbersracket in which those running the numbers win, while individualinvestors, corporations, and the American economy lose.''   For those who follow stock market history, this is an old theme,an echo of similar instances in which it was alleged and sometimesshown that stock trading held special advantages for the powerful,making it in effect a club.   The club is forever being broken up, most memorably followingthe crash of 1929 but again in the late 1960s and early 1970s, whensome of the old-line brokers collapsed under an avalanche of paperand had to be dissolved.   The shenanigans of the 1920s, culminating in the big collapse,had scared individuals from the market. In the 1960s, the New YorkStock Exchange sought to regain them, urging investors to ``ownyour share of American business.''   Millions of small investors were lured into a market unpreparedfor them. Accounts were mishandled, client money was misused. Somebrokers made easy profits, others lost on every sale. Individualsand institutions fell together.   After that, government and the industry sought to reassureinvestors. A form of insurance was introduced, and to some extentit succeeded. Individuals remained a force _ but a shrinking one inrelation to mutual and pension funds.   In recent years, however, there is evidence of a further retreatfrom the market, in part because of market-manipulation scandals.Over the five years 1984-1988, individual investors cashed in ahalf-trillion dollars of shares. Last year the decline amounted to$105 billion. The selling continues in 1989.   Once again, therefore, the issue is public confidence in themarket, a market so volatile that even some of the biggest playersare concerned.   A sound market, they say, is a non-volatile one in which buyingand selling is matched in an orderly fashion. A volatile market,they say, is prima facie evidence of one that is failing itscustomers.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Wednesday, Nov. 1.</NOTE></DOC>
