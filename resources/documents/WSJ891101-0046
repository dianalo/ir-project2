The condition, known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, leads to dizziness and fainting. The typical healthy heart beats 70 times a minute.    The drug, called adenocard, returns the heart to a normal rhythm within seconds, according to Lyphomed.    Medco Research developed the drug and licensed it to Lyphomed for sale in the U.S. and Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
