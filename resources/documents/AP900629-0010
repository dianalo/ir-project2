The subject? Baseball.   ``Many here have found that baseball is particularly compatiblewith intelligence,'' CIA Director William Webster, a die-hard St.Louis Cardinals fan, told the group.   ``Both could be called `the sport of the long season,''' Webstersaid. ``Both demand the long view, a need for teamwork, a demandfor individual performance. Both require excellence and precision.''   Webster had invited Eli Jacobs, owner of the Baltimore Orioles,intelligence expert and well-known figure in some Capitol Hillcircles, to talk to CIA employees about ``The Art, Science andPhilosophy of Baseball.''   Jacobs was joined at the Langley, Va., headquarters by Oriolesmanager Frank Robinson and syndicated columnist George Will, anOrioles director and a Chicago Cubs booster.   Addressing men and women whose lives often are filled with theinternational intrigue that make thriller novels, Webster said ofJacobs:   ``It is as owner of the Baltimore Orioles that he has comeclosest to living out our dreams. To have your own baseball team _now that's something to aspire to.''   Webster, who was a federal judge in St. Louis before he came toWashington, also made some lighthearted remarks about his team _they're last in the National League East these days.   As a lawyer, the CIA chief handled the estate of legendarygeneral manager Branch Rickey, best known for integrating baseballby hiring Jackie Robinson for the Brooklyn Dodgers. According toCIA spokesman Mark Mansfield, Webster also did some work for theold St. Louis Browns, who later moved to Baltimore and became theOrioles.   While many of the nation's spies _ Webster included _ aremesmerized by baseball, Jacobs has spent a lot of his time recentlyon intelligence matters.   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence named Jacobs head ofan unpaid blue-ribbon panel to study future counterintelligenceneeds. The group has recommended ways to crack down on spying.   And the revolving door doesn't stop there.   Sven Holmes, a protege of Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., and thecommittee's former staff director, now does legal work for Jacobsand the Orioles. Boren is chairman of the intelligence committee.   In a bipartisan vein, Jacobs recently hired Tom Daffron, formeradministrative assistant to Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, as theOrioles' senior vice president. Cohen is the ranking Republican onthe intelligence committee.   ``I have two great passions _ politics and baseball,'' Daffronsaid. ``I've gotten to work in both areas.''</TEXT></DOC>
