The 91-nation conference ended its meeting after adding 60 typesof orchids, the salmon-crested cockatoo and the Pacific Islandflying fox to the list of species threatened with extinction.   But while the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies considered proposals to mark as threatened more than 200animals and plants during its meeting, its main concern was theworld's rapidly declining elephant population.   On Monday, the convention put the elephant on the endangeredspecies list and with that approved a ban on trade in ivory.   On Friday, it rejected the U.S. proposal to set quotas for thetusks, a move that would have allowed a maximum 750 elephants to bekilled every year for sport as opposed to commercial trade purposes.   Such a quota would have allowed big-game hunters to take theprized tusks home. In the absence of international rules, federallegislation in several countries, including the United States, willoutlaw hunting trophies under the conference's ban on ivory trade.   A member of the U.S. delegation said the proposal was designedto help wildlife management.   The delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said manycountries still will permit the import of hunting trophies and thatthe proposal would have limited the number of elephants killed forsport.   Botswana delegate Mushanana Nchunga, calling for rejection ofthe U.S. proposal, said: ``It's strange that the same people whohave pushed for an ivory ban are saying it's OK to hunt elephantsfor sport ... OK to decorate the house with tusks but not for awoman to wear ivory earrings.''   The ban on ivory sales goes into effect Jan. 18. It covers tradein elephant tusks, skins and meat and all existing stocks of ivory,most of them in Hong Kong, where Asians in particular covet ivory.   However, countries can get around the convention rulings byfiling for exemptions and several southern African countries _including Botswana, Mozambique, Malawi and Burundi _ have indicatedthey will do so because they consider their elephant managementprograms a success.   Zimbabwe already has formally requested one and South Africanchief delegate Pieter Mulder said Pretoria was ``swaying toward''asking for an exemption.   Under convention rules, this would allow them to sell ivory tomember countries that also have exemptions and to more than 60countries outside the convention.   Japan, the world's biggest market for ivory, has not saidwhether it will request an exemption.   The conference decided Friday to hold its 1992 conference inTokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
