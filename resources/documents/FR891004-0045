The Secretaryof Agriculture evaluates these conservation programs on the basis of criteriaset forth in 7 CFR part 14, and makes a ``primary purpose'' determinationfor the payments made under each program. Before there may be an exclusion,the Secretary of the Treasury must determine that the payments made underthese conservation programs do not substantially increase the annual incomederived from the property benefited by the payments.One of the state conservation programs is the Indiana Critical Soil ErosionCost Share Program authorized by chapter 1, Article 3, title 13 of theIndiana Code.The objectives of the program are: (1) To conserve and protect Indiana'ssoil and water resources, and (2) to protect or restore the environmentby reducing soil erosion and its resulting offsite sedimentation damage.<T3>Procedural Matters: </T3>The USDA has classified this determinationas ``not major'' in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and Secretary'sMemorandum No. 1512-1.
