Last week, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker of Washington, D.C., shocked Eastern by temporarily blocking the move -- an action that the company's union contracts specifically permit. &quot;We think this was totally unprecedented,&quot; says Michael J. Madigan of Akin Gump Straus Hauer andamp; Feld, the Washington, D.C., law firm representing Eastern in the hearings.    How did Eastern's unions persuade the judge to block the job eliminations, if only temporarily? What law deprives Eastern of its right to cut back operations -- a step the carrier claims is necessary to save itself from insolvency?    It is called the Railway Labor Act, a holdover from an era when commerce stood still when the railroads went on strike. Now applied to airlines as well as railroads, Eastern's hard-nosed labor unions have aggressively exploited the act as a weapon in their fierce battles with the management of the Texas Air Corp. unit.    Joined by David Boies, the high-stakes litigator from the Wall Street firm of Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, Akin Gump attorneys yesterday were busily preparing their attack on the unions' position. After extending on Tuesday his original restraining order to Aug. 26 from Aug. 19, Judge Parker today will begin hearing arguments on whether to enter an injunction that would permanently block the cutbacks plan. The ruling isn't expected until sometime after Aug. 26.    The order is only the latest legal victory of the unions under the rail act. Previously, at the behest of the pilots and machinists unions, the courts have constrained Eastern from selling certain assets, transferring employees to newly created units and training replacement workers in preparation for a possible strike.    Since Texas Air acquired the carrier in 1986, Eastern has sought cost concessions from the unions, implicitly threatening to transfer Eastern assets to its low-cost, nonunion Continental Airlines unit if the unions failed to comply.    But the federal courts have ruled in some instances that such moves violate a &quot;status quo&quot; provision in the rail act, which holds that an employer can't unilaterally change working conditions while negotiations are under way. Eastern is currently in contract talks with its pilots, from whom it seeks productivity concessions, and with its machinists and baggage handlers, from whom it seeks wage cuts averaging 20%.    In seeking a preliminary injunction, the unions' attorneys said they will argue that Eastern specifically sought to undermine organized labor through the cutbacks, which the rail act prohibits. In hearings last week, for example, the unions held out an internal corporate memo that cited &quot;maximum shock value&quot; to the unions as one consideration in Eastern's decision to sell the profitable East Coast shuttle service, a plan it later abandoned.    The unions are also expected to claim that the cutbacks serve no business purposes, claiming that they would actually perpetuate losses under certain circumstances.    But Eastern's lawyers say that case law allows airlines to hold &quot;multiple motives&quot; in actions affecting the unions. Eastern proposed the cutbacks and the closing of its Kansas City hub because it was facing losses of $1.5 million a week there, lawyers argued. Since legitimate business reasons prompt the cutbacks, the attorneys will argue, Eastern may also consider the economic pressure on unions as part of the plan. </TEXT></DOC>
