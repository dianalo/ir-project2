Telephone (202) 732 -4888.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Department of Education AppropriationsAct, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-436), signed by President Reagan on September 20,1988, make changes to the determination of a student's expected familycontribution (EFC), also called the Student Aid Index (SAI) under the PellGrant Program, for the 1989-90 award year. For award year 1988-89, a financialaid administrator (FAA) has the authority under section 479A of the HigherEducation Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), to make individual adjustments,based on adequate documentation, to a student's EFC for all the programsof student financial assistance authorized by Title IV of the Higher EducationAct (Title IV programs). For the 1989-90 award year, the Department's AppropriationsAct rescinds that authority for the Pell Grant Program. This rescissionapplies only to the Pell Grant Program and is effective only for the 1989-90award year. The FAA's authority to make adjustments to a student's EFCin the other Title IV programs remains unchanged. Also, an FAA's authorityto make a determination that a student is independent by reason of documentedunusual circumstances under section 411F(12)(B)(vii) of the HEA for allof the Title IV programs remains unchanged.The new legislation provides that in those instances where special conditionsexist (as determined by the Secretary), the student's SAI for the PellGrant Program shall be based upon expected year income instead of baseyear income. That is, any student whose family circumstances meet a specialcondition criterion shall have his or her SAI calculated using the expectedincome for the 1989 calendar year instead of by the standard procedureof using the base year income for the 1988 calendar year. This use of expectedyear income in the Pell Grant formula is identical to the use of expectedyear income in the Pell Grant formula for award years prior to 1988-89.The purpose of these regulations is to provide a list of the special conditionsunder which a computation of a student's SAI, using expected year data,would be performed. The special conditions are the same as those used inthe Pell Grant Program in the 1987-88 award year. In award years previousto 1988-89, if a student qualified for a special calculation because ofa special condition (previously referred to as an ``extraordinary circumstance''),the student completed and filed a supplemental application called a ``SpecialCondition Form.'' Because the statute was amended to require special conditioncalculations for the 1989-90 award year so close to the beginning of the1989-90 processing year, the Department is unable to provide a SpecialConditions Form.To ensure that students know that they may be eligible to have their awardscalculated on the basis of special conditions, a message will be printedon each Student Aid Report (SAR) indicating that a student who believesthat he or she qualifies for a special condition calculation should contacthis or her FAA. Students meeting a special condition criterion will providethe data needed for the special calculation on either the Correction Applicationfor Federal Student Assistance (Correction AFSA) or on the SAR. In eithercase the document will be forwarded to the Federal processor where a computationbased on the expected year data will be made and a new SAR generated.As in award year 1988-89, a student's eligibility for the simplified needstest (SNT) is determined using base year information. If a student qualifiesfor the SNT and also qualifies for a special condition calculation, thatspecial condition calculation is made using full expected year information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education ProvisionsAct (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)), and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested partiesthe opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, under theDepartment of Education Appropriations Act, 1989 (Public Law 100-436) theSecretary is required to apply regulatory criteria governing special conditioncalculation for the 1989-90 award year. The processing cycle for the 1989-90award year began in January 1989. If the Secretary were to delay implementationof these regulations in order to follow notice and comment rulemaking proceedings,the Secretary would be prevented from the due and required execution ofthis law. Moreover, it would be contrary to the public interest to followthese rulemaking procedures because in the absence of immediate implementationof these regulations needy students would be prevented from obtaining thefull amount of Pell Grant assistance for which they are eligible underthe special conditions prescribed by the Secretary. The public is alsounlikely to object to these regulations because they contain special conditionsthat are virtually identical to those contained in the regulations thatwere in effect for the 1987-88 award year and were the product of noticeand comment rulelmaking. Since the regulations are effective for the currentaward cycle only, the delay occasioned by taking public comment would resultin the nonapplication of the Appropriations Act provision to many of thestudents to whom it was intended to apply. Therefore, the Secretary hasdetermined that publication of a proposed rule is unnecessary, impracticable,and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.
