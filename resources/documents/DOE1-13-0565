Three coupled second-orderpartial differential equations are used to represent this dynamic system.The transient solution in the frequency domain, which is obtained fromthe equations after taking the Laplace transform, is presented. A modelreduction approach is used to obtain an approximate solution for theinstantaneous fluid temperature distribution along the collector. Theeffect of varying different design parameters is demonstrated, and specialcases of practical importance are emphasized. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
