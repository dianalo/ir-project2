Standing before a crowd of supporters gathered in front of theCalifornia State Capitol, Bush said: ``I'm not going to let someinsidious rumor-mongers drive me to change my mind. I'm standingbehind Dan Quayle.''   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said the campaign considersquestions about Quayle to be resolved.   ``I think now it's just getting more petty,'' she said. ``It'smore partisan and less credible and we consider it behind us.''   Earlier in Seattle, Bush said he was ``appalled'' at one queryabout Dan Quayle's behavior with a female lobbyist and declaredthat his campaign would get back on track ``whenever you stopasking me these questions.''   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, earlier insisted that nothought was being given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, callingthe 41-year-old Indiana senator ``a tremendous asset.'' And thevice president's aides said they would refer future questions aboutQuayle to the senator's own staff.   Bush, while greeting workers at the Seattle Steel plant, wasasked by reporters about new reports concerning Quayle's purporteduse of special influence to get into law school and the NationalGuard when his undergraduate draft deferment expired during theVietnam War.   The vice president responded simply that such stories wereexaggerated, and, when asked if his campaign was hurt by them, saidhis message would get through to the people ``whenever you stopasking me these questions.''   And Bush told one reporter that ``I'm appalled that you couldask'' about a report concerning Quayle's behavior with Ms.Parkinson, the buxom lobbyist and later Playboy nude model whoshared a vacation cottage with Quayle and two other congressmen ona trip to Florida in 1980.   The Daily News in Los Angeles quoted two former attorneys forMs. Parkinson as saying that she told the FBI in 1981 that Quaylepropositioned her during the trip, but that she refused, saying``I'm with Tom,'' _ then-Rep. Tom Evans, R-Del. Ms. Parkinson waslobbying against a crop insurance bill which Quayle subsequentlyvoted against. Quayle has denied any impropriety concerning thewoman.   And Playboy on Tuesday said an article in its November issuewill include a statement directly from Ms. Parkinson that Quaylepropositioned her during the trip.   Bush, a day earlier, had made an impassioned defense of hisembattled running mate before the Veterans of Foreign Warsconvention in Chicago, and the Bush campaign had Quayle travel toChicago Monday night to make points in his own behalf.   While the vice president mixed with hardhats on the groundsoutside the steel mill, Fuller told reporters that the storm overQuayle ``is something the press is going to have to contend with,''rather than the campaign.   Fuller called the Parkinson report ``ridiculous. There's nothingto it.'' Asked how he knew, he replied simply ``We are certainthere's nothing to it.''   Asked about the latest stories detailing Quayle's purportedjockeying to get into the Indiana National Guard, Bush said, ``Ididn't see it. I never deal in rumors, especially if they're uglyand hurtful.''   Standing before an elbow-to-elbow, jam-packed rally later inPortland's Pioneer Courthouse Square later, Bush said that ``I havemy confidence in the new generation. I have my confidence in DanQuayle, and wait till you see this guy on job training and nationaldefense. You'll be as proud of him as I am.''   At the steel mill earlier, Bush got a generally polite but coolreception from an audience composed largely of members of a UnitedSteel Workers local.   He toured the plant, getting a briefing from managers as hestood on a high railing overlooking a smelter where molten steelwas being poured into huge vats.   On the way into the plant site, Bush's limousine encounteredpro-Bush hard-hats on one side of the narrow road and hard-hatscarrying Dukakis signs across the way.   ``I'm interested in how the members of the union feel, and Ithink we're going to do pretty well with members, and that's whereyou got to so,'' Bush said as he answered questions while greetingpeople along a ropeline.   ``Some of the (union) officials will be the other way _historically they have _ but nobody can dictate to the working manor a working woman ... how they vote.''</TEXT></DOC>
