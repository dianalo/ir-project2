The official News Agency Burma said a curfew was imposed inMyede, 220 miles north of Rangoon, after hundreds of rioters onTuesday destroyed buildings and attacked police, who fired theirguns to disperse the crowd.   Sources in the area said one person was killed and five wounded.   It was not immediately known if the violence was related to thisweek's leadership changes, which included the naming Wednesday ofactive or retired military officers to all but two of the cabinet's22 posts.   Western diplomats had said the rise of Sein Lwin, a 64-year-oldhardliner known for his ruthless supression of dissidents, couldlead to more of the anti-government protests that have broken outthree times since October.   Travelers returning from Rangoon said leaflets have appeared inrecent days urging continued anti-government agitation.   A one-day, emergency session of Parliament elected Sein Lwinpresident. On Tuesday, he assumed the nation's most powerfulposition, chairman of the Burma Socialist Program Party, at aspecial party congress.   The Parliament elected the former deputy prime minister, TunTin, as prime minister. Vice President Aye Ko remained in his post.   Defense Minister Kyaw Htin moved to the No. 3 governmentposition as head of the Council of State, part of a realignmentthat saw changes in eight of the 22 major government positions.   Only two civilians were included in the new lineup: AttorneyGeneral Maung Maung and Education Minister Kyaw Sein. The rest areretired or active duty military officers.   The selections appeared to represent a continuation of thehard-line, one-party system instituted 26 years ago by Ne Win, whoresigned Saturday as president and party chairman.   However, a number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed, andsome balance within the top echelons appears to have been reachedby the promotions of Kyaw Htin and Tun Tin. Both are regarded asrelatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing withdissent in the country. Kyaw Htin also moved up to a top party post.   Sein Lwin, a close associate of Ne Win, commanded forces thatbrutally put down student riots in March in which dozens of peopledied.   Several other officials were reprimanded or fired, includingformer Prime Minister Maung Maung Kha, for their handling of theMarch 18 unrest in Rangoon, but Sein Lwin escaped officiallyunscathed by the incident.   The government has admitted that 43 people died, 41 of themsuffocating in a crowded police van while being taken to prison.Unofficial reports said more than 100 people were killed.   Sein Lwin, who formerly ranked No. 4 in the party hierarchy,also commanded the Fourth Burma Rifles, a unit that opened fire onabout 2,000 anti-government demonstrators at Rangoon University onJuly, 7, 1962. Unofficial casualties were put at more than 100, andthe following day authorities blew up the university's studentunion building.   Sein Lwin was also involved in putting down demonstrations in1974, when students and Buddhist monks, angry at a shoddygovernment funeral for former U.N. Secretary-General U Thant,snatched his coffin and brought it to Rangoon University. Troopsfiring rifles later stormed the campus.   Ne Win cited his age and the recent unrest when he resigned. Inhis resignation speech, he raised hopes that major changes were instore for Burma. In an unprecedented move, he called for areferendum to decide whether the country wished to continue withone-party rule or opt for a multiparty system.   The congress turned down the referendum proposal.   Ne Win's resignation followed three periods of student-ledrioting. There also is mounting discontent over deterioratingeconomic conditions that have made Burma one of the world's 10poorest nations, despite its abundance of natural resources.   The congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms,including allowing joint ventures between private foreign and localinvestors and loosening control on a number of sectors, includingagriculture and forestry. There was initial skepticism amongdiplomats about how far these will go and whether the currentleaders can implement them.   Several diplomats said that the new lineup lacks the expertisein dealing with anything but a state-controlled system, which hasled to plummeting industrial production, food shortages, a foreigndebt of about $4 million and meager social services.   ``That the country has gone from bad to worse (26) years afterthe seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fool'sparadise,'' Aung Gyi, a respected government critic, wrote to NeWin on May 12. ``The country has plunged to the bottom politically,economically and socially. The moral decay is the most deplorable.''   Aung Gyi resigned from Ne Win's government in 1963. His letterhas been widely circulated underground in Rangoon. Ne Win isbelieved to hold his old comrade-in-arms in some respect but therehas been speculation the government would move to silence him.</TEXT></DOC>
