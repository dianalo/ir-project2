Further, suggesting that the broader environmental community will give nuclear power a &quot;second look&quot; as a viable alternative further suggests that you are uninformed.    Whether the high temperatures and the drought this summer signal the onset of the &quot;greenhouse effect,&quot; it is certain that the nuclear industry is exploiting the growing public concern over global warming to revive support for a new generation of reactors.    The industry argues that nuclear power must be resurrected because it is the best solution to global warming. Nuclear proponents hide the fact that U.S. fossil-fueled electricity-generating plants are responsible for about only 4% of the world-wide emissions contributing to the &quot;greenhouse effect.&quot;    Motor-vehicle fumes, deforestation, methane produced by agriculture and farm animals, and a variety of industrial emissions account for the bulk of the problem. Thus, even if we could afford to replace every U.S. electrical plant now fueled by coal, oil or natural gas with a nuclear reactor (which we cannot), little would be done to mitigate the warming of the earth's atmosphere.    Ironically, the construction, maintenance and fueling of nuclear reactors are energy-intensive tasks that rely heavily on fossil fuels that add to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, the plants themselves produce trace amounts of radioactive carbon dioxide.    On the other hand, more than half the nation's electricity now provided by fossil-fuel plants could be economically displaced through improved energy efficiency, passive solar technologies and energy conservation. Such investments would cost one to two cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh); by comparison, new nuclear plants cost approximately 10 to 13 cents per kwh.    In addition, many renewable energy technologies including wind turbines, small hydroelectric plants, geothermal systems, and biomass conversion can provide electricity at a cost lower than can new nuclear facilities. Renewable energy technologies already account for more than 6% of the nation's energy supply -- about the same percentage as nuclear power.    Other energy options such as cogeneration and combined cycle natural-gas turbines can produce electricity more cheaply while producing far less carbon dioxide than can coal-fired plants.    Aside from their lower economic costs, these options also have several other advantages over nuclear reactors. They are environmentally cleaner and do not leave the long-lived, highly radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power. They can be built much more quickly than can nuclear plants. And they are generally more politically acceptable.    Global warming has put a gun to our heads and will force us to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases. However, using nuclear power would constitute pulling the trigger.    Ken Bossong   Director   Critical Mass Energy Project   Public Citizen   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
