That was 1982, ancient history by economists' standards. InNovember of that year, the economy began a powerful expansion thatis about to become the longest in U.S. peacetime history.   Next month, barring calamity, the expansion will tie thepeacetime record set under George Washington from mid-1790 tomid-1796. Economists do not foresee a recession until next year atthe earliest.   The Mississippi River may have receded from its banks thissummer, but the 1980s economy just keeps rolling along, in spite ofbad weather, deficits and the worst stock market crash on record.   On the afternoon of Oct. 19, 1987, with half a trillion dollarsin stock wealth suddenly evaporated, there were widespread fearsthat the United States could be on the brink of another GreatDepression.   Those fears are legitimized in a new study by Christina D. Romerof the University of California at Berkeley, who concludes that theuncertainty generated by the 1929 crash was indeed a major factorin causing the Depression of the 1930s.   ``Uncertainty is worse than knowing the truth, no matter howbad,'' she quotes The Magazine of Wall Street as having said onNov. 30, 1929.   What saved the economy from disaster a year ago were three mainthings:   _The Federal Reserve, which flubbed its job in the 1930s, hadthe good sense this time to open the money spigots, allowing banksto borrow freely and preventing the financial system from goinginto gridlock.   _Consumers kept spending, only slightly daunted by the crash.One reason was obvious in retrospect. Most Americans don't ownstocks. Moreover, investors' losses in stock portfolios were offsetby gains in bonds, which rallied.   _The economy withstood the crash because it was _ and is _basically healthy. In October 1929, a recession had already begun.   So, then, what caused Black Monday? The answer is simple: Whatgoes up must come down. Pumped up by greed and fantasy, the stockmarket had gotten too high, especially in comparison to the largerbut less visible bond market, which competes for investors' dollars.   Instead of adjusting to economic reality gradually, the waytheory says it should, the market plunged in a chaotic anddangerous spiral that was exacerbated by computer-dictated sellingand breakdowns in the trading system.   To be sure, those who say Oct. 19 was a warning thunderclap haveplenty of evidence on their side.   The trade deficit is a persistent reminder that Americans stillaren't winning the battle of international commerce, even with adevalued currency.   In spite of a record expansion, regional recessions haveoccurred in such places as Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia andMichigan.   Auto workers, steelworkers, farmers, miners, and oil drillers _people who work with their hands _ have not fared well in the 1980s.   The economy's high-tech transformation, although necessary tomeet foreign competition, is creating a mismatch between the jobsthat are available and the people who need work. At the bottom, asmall underclass seems mired in permanent poverty.   Overall, living standards are rising, but more slowly than theyused to. That's because productivity improvements have slowed down,for reasons that are not fully understood.   U.S. productivity is growing at an anemic 0.2 percent annualrate, compared with 0.7 percent in West Germany and 1.9 percent inJapan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentestimates.   Most troubling, the United States has gone from the world'slargest creditor to its biggest debtor. ``Debt'' here is shorthandfor all sorts of foreign investments, including stocks, real estateand companies.   Optimists say foreign money will rebuild America the same way itdid in the 19th century, when London banks financed the railroads.   Pessimists respond that America's foreign debt is the result offoolish overspending that is going into consumption rather thaninvestment.   All debt, including the kind Americans owe to each other, hasskyrocketed in the 1980s to more than 2.3 times the gross nationalproduct, Bank Credit Analyst reported recently.   Such a top-heavy debt ratio has not been seen since theDepression.   For all the legitimate complaints about the health of theeconomy, though, it is undeniable that growth is better thanrecession, which causes human misery while leaving productiveresources wastefully unused.   In September 1982, the tail end of the last recession, thejobless rate peaked at a 42-year high of 10.1 percent. Todayunemployment and inflation are bouncing between 5 percent and 6percent.   While Europe has stagnated and Japan's world-beating growth hasslowed down, the United States has created 15.5 million jobs sincePresident Reagan's inauguration.   Economists can't agree why the United States has managed toavoid recession for so long. One prominent idea, which might becalled the Kneejerk Theory, gives credit to the fast reflexes ofthe bond market.   The Kneejerk Theory says bond holders have learned to panic atany sign of 1970s-style inflation. When the economy shows signs ofoverheating, they dump bonds. That drives up interest rates, whichdampens the economy, preventing an inflationary spiral that wouldlead to a crash.   The Deficit Theory says the United States is able to avoid arecession-inducing runup in interest rates because it is financingits high level of spending with foreign borrowing _ trouble in thelong run.   According to the New Age Theory, investments in labor-savingequipment to cope with the coming labor shortage will allow theUnited States to enjoy both low inflation and a low jobless rate.Aging baby boomers will jack up the low U.S. savings rate.   Finally there is the Luck Theory, which explains fortunateevents ranging from the drop in the dollar, which rejuvenatedexports, to the stock market crash itself, which knocked downinterest rates just as they were getting prohibitively high.   When a recession finally does hit, it will be unusually severebecause of the likelihood of rippling defaults on the recordmountains of debt. Consider that farm banks and the savings andloan industry are in trouble even without a nationwide recession.   The federal budget deficit, already high, will skyrocket in arecession as tax receipts fall and spending goes up.   With the United States removed as an engine of world growth, anydownturn here is likely to spread to Latin America and could extendto Western Europe and the Far East.   There are plenty of causes for concern. But then, there alwaysare. In comparison to what people feared last October, things arelooking surprisingly good.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
