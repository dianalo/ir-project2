It could besubstantially enhanced if, in the countries with large water-power potentials,water power plants could be coupled with plants for hydrogen productionby electrolytic process. No doubt, hydrogen produced additionally inwater power plants will account for only a minor fraction of the demandof energy to be met. Its real significance lies in the fact that it ispossible to start setting up a hydrogen-gased energy economy at an earlydate, using proven technologies - electrolysis through water power.</TEXT></DOC>
