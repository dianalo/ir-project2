Foley is refusingto name the miscreants.;   Even though there were 4,235 bounced checks in asix-month period, nearly 10 per member, this little flap was mostly symbolic.Bounced checks cost no taxpayers or depositors anything, nor would the bankever lose money, since the House could always withhold funds from a delinquentmember's paycheck.;   But as with John Sununu's trips, the symbol reveals areal issue: the arrogance of power.;   Presumably, the House decided it neededits own informal bank because it can be a hassle to get to the bank. Haven'tthey heard of automated teller machines?;   The House exempted itself fromthis hassle of everyday life. Nothing would have been made of it had it notcaptured in a tidy analogy how Congress likes to exempt itself from far moreconsequential restrictions that others live under.;   For a time, rulesagainst employment discrimination applied in the workaday world, but not inCongress. The names of the check bouncers can't be pried out of Foley becausethe Freedom of Information Act doesn't apply to Congress. Living within one'smeans hasn't applied in Congress for quite some time.;   Some representativesare calling for disclosure of bank records. They'd like to clear their names,and they have a point.;   Cynicism about Congress makes representatives' jobsmore difficult and leads to reforms bred of anger, such as term limits. Oneway to dispel it is for Congress to call its wayward members to account.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911002  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  319  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 2, 199100276094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
