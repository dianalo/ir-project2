Her husband, Doug Tompkins, also 45, the other owner of Esprit de Corp., couldn't disagree more: &quot;What the hell is growing up? Who wants to grow up? We all know that sex appeal goes down over time, and we're in a sex-appeal business. Fashion is made by the young. That's axiomatic.&quot;    Yes, closely held Esprit has identity troubles. It also has a unique management problem -- it is run by an estranged married couple who live in separate buildings on their sprawling lot overlooking San Francisco Bay, clash over personal matters and increasingly disagree on business issues. In particular, they don't see eye to eye on the direction of what was once the hottest new apparel company in the U.S. and one of the most unusually run anywhere.    &quot;We've been fighting like cats in a bag for 15 years,&quot; says Mr. Tompkins. &quot;It's just a matter of convenience that we remain married.&quot; Their views of life seem to differ profoundly now. He spends a lot of time rock climbing and talks frankly about the role of sex in the office place. She says she has adopted a more mature &quot;life of the mind.&quot;    In the past 15 years, Esprit grew from a tiny dressmaker into an international fashion giant with more than $1 billion of sales, trading brilliantly on a West Coast cachet of youth, adventure and nonconformity. Its loose-fitting, brightly colored, informal clothing, often splashed with the Esprit logo, sparked a new look in women's fashions. Esprit also tried to forge a new kind of California capitalism tying management and labor together with a common &quot;zest for life.&quot;    Suddenly all that joie de vivre went out of style. In a tailspin that began 18 months ago, Esprit's panache and profitability have plunged. In its fiscal year ended last June 30, its earnings fell 83% to $10 million from $62 million; its U.S. sales were almost flat at $407 million, compared with a 22% jump in fiscal 1986. Gross profit margins sank to 2.5%, about one-seventh of prior years' levels. Esprit's world-wide sales still grew rapidly, to $1.2 billion from $860 million, but foreign operations are jointly owned with local investors and those profits aren't repatriated to the U.S.    Many of Esprit's troubles reflect those of other specialty-apparel makers. They are hampered today by the dollar's fall, which increases the cost of the goods they import from Asian plants, and by a general slowing in the growth of consumer spending. But Esprit's problems run deeper.    Partly because of the co-owners' rift, the company missed a pivotal transition in fashions two years ago toward a plainer, more traditional look. As sales dropped, Mr. Tompkins led a wildly expensive charge into opening Esprit's own retail stores, a business in which Esprit's executives lacked experience. Insiders complain that the company also wasted millions of dollars hiring many people not for their talent but for their good looks.    Ultimately, &quot;Esprit totally lost touch with both its customers and its retailers,&quot; says Nancy Smith, divisional merchandise manager of Dayton Hudson Corp. in Minneapolis. Adds Corrado Federico, Esprit's president and chief operating officer: &quot;You can have all the image and panache in the world, but without substance forget it.&quot;    Today Mr. Tompkins, who is Esprit's chief executive officer, is in a rescue mode, and there are some signs of better times ahead. He has replaced many Esprit veterans with executives from outside the company and, under pressure from his banks, has laid off 700 of the company's 2,200 U.S. employees. He has also gone on an uncharacteristic cost-cutting binge, going so far as to strip the headquarters staff of free coffee and personal-phone-call privileges.    What's more, Mr. Tompkins has sold several buildings, closed a major warehouse, curtailed development of some new product lines and scrapped plans to open more company-owned stores. Yet he still says he wants a capital infusion from an outside equity partner to finance future growth.    The shake-up and austerity jolted an Esprit staff accustomed to one of the most laid-back management styles and some of the cushiest perks in the corporate world. Employees used to call the company headquarters &quot;Camp Esprit.&quot; Until the recent cutbacks, their benefits included free access to a Lake Tahoe ski cabin, free tickets to local cultural events and company-subsidized rafting vacations in Asia, Africa and South America.    &quot;Esprit is youthfulness, sportiness, a zest for life,&quot; Mr. Tompkins says. &quot;We have a sense of humor, a sense of irony and whimsy. We're multidimensional. We have a workplace that's humanistic but at the same time we recognize the realities of being in business.&quot;    These days, few employees agree that Esprit's management is particularly &quot;humanistic.&quot;    Says one former product manager, laid off last year after three years with the company: &quot;It was as if all the humanitarian stuff had sounded fantastic in newspapers and magazines and attracted interesting people, but didn't mean anything in terms of real concern for people working there. It all seemed so hypocritical.&quot;    According to Esprit employees and industry analysts, a key source of Esprit's problems was the inability of the Tompkinses to agree on a variety of issues.    The couple met in 1963 in Lake Tahoe, Nev., while he was working as a tree-topper and she was working as a keno runner. From the beginning, Mrs. Tompkins designed Esprit's clothes while her husband ran the company. But as Esprit matured, they grew apart. Mr. Tompkins spent several months each year rock climbing on different continents. He saw himself, and still does, as a &quot;citizen of the world,&quot; unmellowed by age and an expert on architecture and fashion. Mrs. Tompkins, meanwhile, says she outgrew the sun-and-sport life style and is deeply concerned with such social issues as AIDS and the homeless.    Friends and colleagues say that the Tompkinses' own tensions -- their relationship went through alternating periods of bitter enmity and passionate reconciliation -- created tensions at the company. They say that the Tompkinses sometimes tried to undermine each other's actions and formed rival alliances with employees.    Last year, for example, Esprit had to pay a huge severance fee to a well-known Japanese designer who worked less than a year for the company after Mr. Tompkins had hired him over his wife's protestations. &quot;Susie wouldn't work with him,&quot; says Mr. Tompkins.    &quot;There's an invisible line that runs right through the design room. You're either on Susie's side or you're on Doug's,&quot; says Brielle Johnck, a lifelong friend of Mrs. Tompkins and her personal assistant at Esprit until September. Ms. Johnck says she quit after becoming &quot;worn down by Susie and Doug's unhappiness.&quot;    Close associates of Mrs. Tompkins say she urged her husband in vain to check his lavish expenditures. He snapped back that his wife just didn't understand his vision.    Extramarital affairs also disrupted the company, employees say. Mrs. Tompkins ridiculed her husband when a friend of his, author Leonard Koren, completed a sample chapter of a biography of Mr. Tompkins. It chronicled the chief executive's involvement in a &quot;septigon&quot; of sexual relationships among Esprit employees. After Mr. Tompkins rejected the chapter and returned it to the writer for reworking, Mrs. Tompkins joked that she wanted to recommission the work in its original form, says Mr. Koren. The author recently completed a more &quot;philosophical&quot; manuscript, which he dubs &quot;the world according to Doug.&quot;    &quot;We talked a lot about Doug's fundamental feeling that sexuality is part of every employee's personality,&quot; says Mr. Koren. &quot;He believes that if you want to harness the entire employee, you have to engage the entire being. The people pool is also a breeding pool. In Doug's experience, 98% of intraoffice affairs turn out fine. In 2% it doesn't work.&quot;    Explains Mr. Tompkins: &quot;There are emotional relationships in any business. Whether they end up in bed or not, that's irrelevant. I don't know any such relationship that has caused adverse effects within this company.&quot;    His wife says, &quot;A lot of people like to talk about Doug and me, but they don't understand the real situation. Underneath it all, Doug and I have a tremendous amount of respect for each other.&quot; She adds, &quot;We have a very unique relationship. We're both very independent.&quot;    The founders' differences were reflected in their running argument over fashion. Mr. Tompkins felt that his wife went overboard in trying to create an older, more &quot;career&quot; look for some of the company's clothes. The new look would have meant toning down the company's bright, youthful image to make a dressier appeal. Mr. Tompkins would have none of it.    &quot;Doug took the image in one direction, while we tried to take the product in another,&quot; recalls a former executive who worked with Mrs. Tompkins. &quot;He didn't understand that people no longer wanted to go skipping through the air with 'Esprit' on their chests.&quot;    Then, in the fall of 1986, Esprit suffered its first losing quarter ever as a major company. &quot;Suddenly Esprit ran into this incredible wall of consumer resistance,&quot; says Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, an industry newsletter. &quot;They failed to realize the consumer was changing under their nose.&quot;    The shift in fashions occurred at a particularly bad time for Esprit, which was in the throes of an expensive push into retailing. The company built 14 stores in 1984-87. Mrs. Tompkins feels that Esprit moved too fast at a time when it needed to pause and reorient its image. &quot;Expansion put a lot of pressure on the {product} line,&quot; she says. &quot;You have to allow yourself the flexibility and time to get on with the next step.&quot;    Mr. Tompkins has been a big spender for several years. Once he threw a party for 6,000 employees and their friends and published a glossy book of photographs of many of the guests, taken by a top fashion photographer. He certainly spared no expense in building Esprit's stores, ordering costly changes of newly completed work and paying amazing attention to detail.    At Esprit's big Los Angeles outlet, for example, Mr. Tompkins experimented with a black concrete floor that came out so slippery that people could hardly walk on it. It had to be redone at the last minute. Recalls one contractor who worked for Esprit: &quot;You got the feeling that Doug liked to work off a full-scale model.&quot;    Partly because of Mr. Tompkins's tinkering, most Esprit stores cost between $80 and $120 per square foot to build, according to Esprit executives, while most Gap Inc. stores, say, cost about $70 a square foot. Some Esprit stores even ran higher. The Los Angeles store cost more than $400 a square foot.    &quot;I shouldn't have spent so much on L.A.,&quot; Mr. Tompkins concedes. Despite such extravagance, he adds, at least some Esprit stores are profitable.    Similar excesses got Esprit into trouble with some department stores selling its line. Mr. Tompkins put pressure on the major chains to construct specially designed Esprit shops within their stores, with custom details costing three times more than the chains usually spend on such facilities. In doing so, he alienated some retailers, who later didn't provide the backing and promotion that apparel companies need during difficult times.    &quot;When you're hot, the department stores will eat humble pie,&quot; says one executive close to Esprit. &quot;But when you're not, you better have friends. Esprit was too arrogant.&quot; Says Mr. Tompkins: &quot;The stores know our shops increase sales. If we paid for them, we'd have one in every store in the U.S.&quot;    Esprit was also plagued by inexperienced managers. In 1984, for example, Mr. Tompkins named a six-year Esprit executive to head the fledgling retail division, although this manager had little knowledge of retailing. One former employee says she went from secretary to product manager in 28 months, negotiating with Asian suppliers for contracts worth as much as $300,000 a month. &quot;I had no idea what I was doing,&quot; she recalls. &quot;We threw money away.&quot;    Esprit is now a leaner company that operates more conventionally. According to Mr. Federico, the operations chief, each division now has a budget to follow, for the first time. The new executives in Esprit's senior management, including veterans from Calvin Klein and Izod LaCoste, have tightened marketing and quality controls. Officers for major department stores say Esprit is keeping closer track of sales and offering clothes more in tune with today's tastes.    &quot;Their sportswear for spring looks wonderful,&quot; says Colleen Bissell, a buyer for Macy's of California. She reports a &quot;healthy pickup&quot; in Esprit sales at Macy's lately. Adds Ms. Smith of Dayton Hudson: &quot;They've put people in place who can talk to retailers.&quot;    Mr. Tompkins predicts that Esprit's U.S. earnings will about double to $20 million in the current fiscal year, on basically flat sales. &quot;We're running better than before with a third less people,&quot; he says.    But that earnings level still indicates depressed profit margins. And meanwhile, the Tompkinses continue to feud. Mrs. Tompkins resents her husband's recent push into her domain of clothing design. &quot;I'm the product person and that's what I fight for,&quot; she says.    Mr. Tompkins doesn't care for Mrs. Tompkins's harping about the company's too-youthful image, a look he has spent years cultivating with Esprit's top photographer, Oliviero Toscani. He snaps:   &quot;This company will never have a career orientation. Will I listen to Toscani before I listen to Susie? You bet. He's the image maker and she isn't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
