It does have a long, narrow shelf that holds his computer and a telephone, but not much else.    &quot;I don't believe in desks,&quot; says Mr. Sharer, who is MCI's new senior vice president for sales and marketing. Instead, he says, he does his best thinking at his circular table -- or on the road.    Since Mr. Sharer became MCI's chief marketer four months ago, he has applied his unorthodox approach to revamping more than the office formerly used by Vice Chairman Orville Wright. Indeed, Mr. Sharer says he has &quot;tried to make marketing a more line-focused function.&quot;    To that end, the 41-year-old alumnus of General Electric Co., McKinsey andamp; Co. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has reorganized the marketing sector's management and put special emphasis on what he calls &quot;alternate-channel marketing.&quot; The concept involves forging alliances with American Airlines, American Express, Amway, Sears, Visa and others who sell or offer tie-ins with MCI long-distance services to their own customers.    &quot;I think we should grow our alternate-channel business more rapidly than it has grown in the past,&quot; says Mr. Sharer. He speaks of channels -- telemarketing, for example, is a channel to the consumer market -- with all the enthusiasm of a corporate Shirley Maclaine.    Since Mr. Sharer arrived, the company also had started to target the data-transmission market as an important growth area. He picked an outsider, Don Heath from Xtra Soft Inc., a California software company, to head MCI's data-marketing push.    A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., with a background in aeronautical engineering, Mr. Sharer peppers his conversation with military allusions. &quot;It's not always the guys with the most men on the battlefield who take the day,&quot; he says, referring to MCI's competition with giant ATandamp;T. Later he explains: &quot;If you study business and warfare, the principles that are important are absolute.&quot;    &quot;He's very aggressive,&quot; says Ronald Spears, president of MCI's Midwest division, who worked with Mr. Sharer at ATandamp;T. &quot;Kevin will fit in fine in our culture.&quot; Another close friend, MCI's chief financial officer, Daniel Akerson, was at the Naval Academy and at ATandamp;T with Mr. Sharer.    MCI caught Mr. Sharer between moves with GE. He had been president of GE American Communications, a satellite subsidiary, and was set to move to GE's jet-engine business in Cincinnati. He was getting ready to begin that assignment when MCI made him an offer he didn't refuse.    Bert Roberts, MCI's president, says he had been looking for an executive to run the strategic side of the marketing operations, but hadn't launched a formal search. When Messrs. Akerson and Spears recommended Mr. Sharer, Mr. Roberts eagerly called him. &quot;Ron Spears is West Point, and West Pointers don't necessarily volunteer that Annapolis guys are great,&quot; Mr. Roberts explains.    One of Mr. Sharer's biggest challenges will be maintaining MCI's rapid growth. Revenue jumped 30% last year to $5.14 billion and is continuing its double-digit climb this year. He credits MCI senior vice president Stu Mencher, who is now on special assignment, with &quot;putting a lot of the building blocks in place.&quot; Mr. Sharer also took over much of the marketing responsibilities of executive vice president Brian Thompson, who now concentrates on MCI's future development.    &quot;The strategy MCI adopted two years ago is fundamentally the right strategy,&quot; Mr. Sharer says, referring to MCI's plan to compete against ATandamp;T in all market segments. Nevertheless, he says, the right strategy &quot;doesn't mean we don't have tactical opportunities or emphasis opportunities to do better.&quot;    By rearranging management, he has set up two avenues for corporate marketing to attack problems: products and market segments. Three top managers concentrate on products, with one responsible for long-range strategy and technology. Another three head up each of MCI's main market segments: consumer, general business and large business and government accounts. MCI's autonomous regional divisions provide an additional approach.    On the product side, Mr. Sharer says, the long-distance business isn't one in which competitors &quot;will be able to create a sustainable advantage based on products alone&quot; because new services can be duplicated quickly. &quot;But if you can figure out a way to continually have six-month leads, then the product-development effort becomes a sustainable advantage.&quot;    Mr. Sharer says an important goal is to forge stronger links between field offices and headquarters. Even when his &quot;new guy routine&quot; is old hat, he says he plans to spend two or three days a month meeting with MCI salesmen to gather suggestions on what customers want and what MCI could do better.    Mr. Sharer doesn't believe in a desk-bound staff, either. He recalls with amusement the time he literally locked the office doors and dispatched all his marketing people to the field for three days. Mr. Sharer says he even plans to print up signs for himself and his subordinates with novelist John le Carre's line: &quot;A desk is a dangerous place from which to watch the world.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
