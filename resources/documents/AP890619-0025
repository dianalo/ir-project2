Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., chief sponsor of the $1.75 billionmeasure, said such a network could be as important to the country'sinformation future as the interstate highway system was in buildingup U.S. transportation over the past three decades.   ``High-capacity fiber optic networks will be the informationsuperhighways of tomorrow,'' he declared.   Gore added that ``the nation which most completely assimilateshigh-performance computing into its economy will very likely emergeas the dominant intellectual, economic and technological force inthe next century.''   In addition to the supercomputer network, the TennesseeDemocrat's bill also calls for a coordinated national strategy onhigh-performance computer technology as well as increased fundingfor research and development of computer equipment and software.   The Gore legislation is to be taken up at a hearing Wednesday ofthe Senate Commerce subcommittee on science, technology and space.   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., a co-sponsor of the measure, said``the United States is recognized as the world leader insupercomputing, but this doesn't mean that countries like France,West Germany and Japan like it. Foreign competition is growing.   ``One way to ensure that our pre-eminence in supercomputing isnot wasted is to make the data readily accessible to everyone thatcan benefit from it,'' Jeffords said. ``If we bring academia,industry and government together, we're going to see results.''   Another co-sponsor, Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., noted thatsupercomputers were among items singled out in the Bushadministration's recent ``Super 301'' action citing Japan for unfairtrading practices.   ``We make the best supercomputers in the world, and there is noreason the Japanese should refuse to give serious consideration toour supercomputers simply because Japan wants to develop its ownsupercomputer industry,'' Durenberger said.   The status and future of supercomputing in the United States isalso to be the focus of a hearing Tuesday by the House Sciencesubcommittee on science, research and technology.   Marc Rotenberg, Washington representative of ComputerProfessionals for Social Responsibility, a public interest groupbased in Palo Alto, Calif., called the Gore legislation ``goodnews.''   ``We need to be reconsidering funding priorities in computerscience,'' Rotenberg said. ``Sen. Gore's bill would strengthen ourbasic research, in research institutions across the country, andalso develop infrastructure to make it possible for systems that arealready in place to be accessible to more users.''   Most supercomputer networks currently run 2,000 times slower thanthe 3 gigabit per second network which Gore's measure aims to createby 1996.   The bill embodies many of the recommendations set forth in aNovember 1987 report issued by the White House Office of Science andTechnology Policy.   That report concluded that ``a strong domestic high-performancecomputer industry is essential for maintaining U.S. leadership incritical national security areas and in broad sectors of thecivilian economy.''</TEXT></DOC>
