The party acknowledged the Solidarity triumph in a statement atthe start of the evening newscast by its spokesman Jan Bisztyga,who was shown sitting at the elbow of Solidarity national spokesmanJanusz Onyszkiewicz.   ``The results are genuinely unfavorable for the (party-led)coalition,'' he said. ``The elections had a plebiscite nature andSolidarity got a decided majority.'' However, he did not givespecific results.   Final official results from Sunday's election for a new Senateand the existing Sejm, or lower house, were not expected untilWednesday.   Bisztyga pledged that the party would not quarrel with theresults. ``We will not back away from the road of democracy andreforms.'' But he called on the opposition to also share``responsibility for the country.''   ``If feelings of triumph and adventurism cause anarchy inPoland, democracy and social peace will be seriously threatened.Authorities, the coalition and the opposition cannot allow such asituation,'' he said.   Onyszkiewicz spoke briefly after Bisztyga and cautioned thatsome returns were still coming in. ``But despite that, it is avictory,'' he declared.   Earlier in the day, when partial returns indicated a Solidaritylandslide, Lech Walesa, the leader of the newly legalized union,said: ``It's too early for congratulations and we don't havecomplete information yet.''   In its first dispatch on results, the official PAP news agencytonight confirmed overwhelming Solidarity victories in at least 11cities. It cautioned that the results were unofficial and mightvary in other places.   Only a few Solidarity candidates in the race for the new100-seat Senate appeared unsure of first-round victory, saidOnyszkiewicz, indicating firm opposition control of the East bloc'sfirst freely chosen legislative chamber.   Under an agreement with Solidarity, the Communist Party was toreceive 65 percent of the Sejm. To achieve that some CommunistParty candidates ran unopposed, but the party's results indicatedthat some of them did not get the 50 percent voter approvalrequired to be elected.   It was not immediately clear what would happen to any Sejm seatsnot filled in the election. Solidarity argued they should be leftvacant, but the government left open the possibility of anotherelection for just those seats.   The economy is a shambles, and the communists badly needed theopposition's cooperation if it is to be revived.   Under the deal struck April 5 by communist authorities andSolidarity, the opposition was given a chance to control theSenate. The opposition gained the rights to field candidates forall 100 Senate seats, and for 161, or 35 percent, of those in the460-member Sejm.   The communists were thereby theoretically guaranteed a majoritywhen the chambers jointly convene to elect the president, but theSenate would have veto power over all legislation approved by theSejm.   No results announced today, official or unofficial, indicatedthat a Communist Party candidate won a seat on the 100-memberSenate.   Unofficial returns issued earlier today showed that with 159 of1,253 voting stations reporting in Warsaw, Solidarity candidatesfor the three Senate seats from Warsaw were leading handily. TheSolidarity tallies indicated all had obtained more than 70 percentof the vote.   The numbers were similar in the races for the Sejm.   In the southern city of Krakow, with about half the precinctsreporting, Solidarity's Senate candidates led all others for thetwo seats, drawing in 83 percent and 74 percent of the vote, theSolidarity campaign there said.   In a district near Krakow with 62 percent of precinctsreporting, the Solidarity Senate hopefuls had 82 percent and 75percent of the vote, the campaign said.   Results from Gdansk showed Solidarity also well ahead in theSejm races and indicated that prominent party figures and theirallies running for the Sejm were failing to get the 50 percentapproval required.   Partial results showed that the highest vote-getter on the partylist of candidates in Gdansk, Poltiburo member Wladyslaw Baka,received 44 percent of the votes based on reports of 20 of theBaltic port's 189 precincts.</TEXT></DOC>
