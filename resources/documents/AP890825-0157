The U.S. government used to accept almost all Soviet Jews whoapplied for immigration, but changed its policy in October becauseof the large number now permitted to leave the Soviet Union.   ``We have just been drinking water since Monday,'' said EdwardLeitman, who has lived for seven months with his wife and daughterin Ladispoli, north of Rome. ``This may possibly make them changetheir minds.''   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hahn declined comment on theprotest Friday. He said recently that Soviet Jews now mustdemonstrate they were persecuted for political or religious reasonsto enter the United States as refugees.   Since October, about 4,000 applicants at the embassy in Italyhave been denied visas, he said.   The fast is the latest protest by Soviet Jews in front of theembassy.   Italy is a transit point for Soviets trying to immigrate to otherWestern countries. All of the Jews could immigrate to Israel, butmost are trying to get to the United States or Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
