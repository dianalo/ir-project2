<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0881 </DOCNO><TEXT>Immersion experiments have been performed to investigate the effect ofliquid uranium on 0.3-mm-thick foils of tungsten metal in the temperaturerange of 1160 to 1350/sup 0/C, for immersion times up to 20 h, in zirconiacrucibles. The original and uranium-reacted foils have been studied microscopically(SEM-EDAX) and the internal morphology has been determined. The latteris affected by the heat-treatment and penetration of liquid uranium.The penetration is partial up to 1210/sup 0/C, accompanied by a partialuranium-assisted recrystallization, forming two metallurgically-differentregions, which on cooling result in the observed cracks due to inhomogeneousstrain. The penetration of liquid uranium is complete at 1255/sup 0/Cand above, inducing recrystallization of tungsten grains throughout thefoil, with larger, uranium-lined, grains in inner regions, and smaller,progressively-separated, tungsten grains in outer regions (with reductionin foil thickness).</TEXT></DOC>
