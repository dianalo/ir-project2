Occasionally, descriptive reports were generateddisplaying rainfall and insolation data from this database. Both thedata storage and processing programs resided on a Hewlett-Packard desktopcomputer system no longer in use by researchers in Environmental Sciences.Furthermore, the format and processing of data over the six years thesystem has been in operation have not been consistent. The goals of thisconversion project were to document the existing data formats, developprocessing program(s) capable of managing the various formats, and establishprocedures for the continuing transfer of new data from the GOES systemin Virginia to its final storage on an IBM PC system. To achieve thesegoals, the following materials were developed: the computer program MITRANS,which translates raw data retrieved by the old communications programinto edited, self-documenting files organized by site and year, nineteenconsolidated data input files, which contain all data from 1982 to May31, 1988, a comprehensive data dictionary, reflecting all that is knownabout the 13 different data formats that have been used over the last6 years, procedures for managing the communications program still runningon the Hewlett-Packard computer and transferring its raw data files tothe IBM PC, sample input and output files that test the various dataformats, and this project report and reference manual. 20 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
