Plans for a gas-fired power station will have a numberof advantages, including economic, over either oil or coal because ofprojected gas royalties and power sales. A pipeline brings the gas fromthe Amadeus field to Darwin and the Channel Island power station, whichwas Australia's first gas-fired combined cycle plant.
