A plot-line for the TV show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;? No, it's anexample that Biodyne Institute, South San Francisco, Calif.,uses to support its position that short-term mental healthtreatment can shrink long-term health costs.   In a four-year study, the research firm found that annualmedical costs fell about 35% among patients who had a fewsessions of &quot;focused&quot; psychotherapy. For those who hadtraditional psychotherapy or no mental health care, changesin medical costs ranged from slight declines to 25%increases. Targeted treatment proved most cost-effectiveamong diabetics and other chronically ill patients, whoconsume a disproportionate share of healthcare resources. Thestudy of 44,663 Medicaid patients and U.S. employees inHawaii was funded by the U.S. Health Care FinanceAdministration.   Focused therapy treats specific complaints over a periodlimited to several weeks, says Nicholas Cummings, apsychologist who's chairman and president of Biodyne.Traditional psychotherapy regards such complaints as symptomsof broader problems; treatment is usually open-ended andlately a target of health-care cost-cutters.   As for the lineman, he became depressed, couldn't climbtelephone poles and refused to maintain regular insulintreatments. Every two weeks, he ended up in an emergency roomin a diabetic coma. His medical bills soared.   Diagnosis: He hated his job. Eight weeks of therapy failedto cure him of journalistic yearnings, but it helped himaccept a compromise -- a job as a proofreader in a publishingcompany. He resumed consistent insulin injections, hisdepression went away and his medical bills plunged, Mr.Cummings says.   Biodyne is not-for-profit, but Mr. Cummings is also chiefexecutive officer of American Biodyne Inc., which providesmental health services based on the Hawaii study in severalstates. The company projects that revenue will more thandouble to $27 million in the year ending Sept. 30.                                                                                                          High-Tech Diagnostics   Aren't the Only Culprit                                                                                                          MAGNETIC resonance aging and coronary angiography areamong the high-tech tests that take much of the blame forunnecessary costs in medical diagnosis. But some low-techtests waste money, too.   When hospital patients develop diarrhea, doctors commonlyorder stool tests to look for bacteria such as salmonellathat might cause food poisoning or similar digestivedistress. But for patients already hospitalized at leastthree days, these tests almost never find the cause of theproblem.   University of Pennsylvania Hospital researchers found thatin a study of 3,387 samples checked for bacteria orparasites, all 76 positive tests were from outpatients orfrom those tested within three days of admission. Yet nearlyhalf the samples were from patients first tested after theirthird day in the hospital.   &quot;Such practices misuse hospital and laboratory resourcesat a time when cost containment must be considered apriority,&quot; say the researchers in a recent issue of theJournal of the American Medical Association. Hospital labsdid about four million such tests in 1988. Eliminating 30% to50% of them would save $20 million to $30 million in annualhospital expenses, the researchers say.                                                                                                          Mass Cholesterol Tests   Work on Wall Street                                                                                                          WORKPLACE cholesterol screening programs -- alreadypopular -- get a new boost from a report that shows theywork.   A program among 886 workers at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. notonly succeeded in lowering cholesterol levels, but alsoappeared to reduce overall heart-disease risk for manyparticipants.   In initial 15-minute sessions, nurses measured cholesterollevels with fingerstick tests and recorded blood pressure,height and weight while awaiting the results. They also gaveparticipants pep talks on ways to change unhealthy habits.   The tests showed that 411 employees, or 47%, had high orborderline-high cholesterol. About 275 returned for asix-month followup. Their cholesterol levels fell an averageof 8.3%, according to the report in the May issue of Archivesof Internal Medicine. There were other benefits. &quot;If you do alittle counseling with the screening, people will makesignificant changes in diet, weight, exercise and smoking,&quot;says Donald H. Gemson, a professor at Columbia University'sSchool of Public Health in New York.   Dr. Gemson and the other researchers didn't do a costanalysis of the program, but large-scale screenings, run bynurses rather than physicians, are much less expensive thanindividual blood tests sent to labs for analysis andinterpreted by doctors, he says.   Another plus: &quot;It's very popular with employees,&quot; Dr.Gemson says. &quot;They don't have to go to private doctors andspend money out-of-pocket.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SEVEN of 10 employees believe their employers shouldprovide health benefits for their families, but nine of 10employers say they plan to reduce or eliminate coverage.These findings in surveys conducted for Northwestern NationalLife Insurance Co., Minneapolis, point to growing conflictover benefits, the insurer says. . . . Uninsured women spendan average of 1.9 days in the hospital for routinechildbirth, while those with traditional insurance spend 2.3days, says Healthcare Knowledge Systems, Ann Arbor, Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
