The leaders, who attended signing ceremonies Tuesday for lessimportant agreements, on Wednesday also will exchange copies of aratified treaty to eliminate U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles.   That pact was signed at the summit last December, ratifiedwithin the past week by the U.S. Senate and the Soviet Presidium,and flown to Moscow by White House chief of staff Howard H. BakerJr.   Progress on the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty came ona U.S. proposal for verifying limits on mobile missiles and acompromise on counting air-launched cruise missiles, said thesenior administration official, who spoke on condition he not beidentified.   But no progress was reported on Star Wars, which the Sovietsdescribe as the main impediment to a START agreement to cutlong-range weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.   At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign astrategic arms pact in Moscow, but talks stalled over Star Wars,mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboardwarplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a U.S. callto phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles.   Gorbachev expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks,although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed bythe end of the Reagan presidency.   Gorbachev told reporters Tuesday that maybe it's ``time to bangour fists on the table'' to end the impasse.   Reagan replied: ``I'll do anything that works,'' but said hewould not bargain away Star Wars, formally known as the StrategicDefense Initiative.   ``It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said Reagan.   Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the UnitedStates had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, theMidgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobilemissiles, the SS-24 and SS-25.   During the summit, American negotiators offered a proposal theyhad been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles tocarefully defined geographical areas, dubbed ``garrisons,'' whichwould be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillancefrom spy satellites.   ``The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said theU.S. official.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov referred onMonday to progress on the mobile issue, but neither the Soviets northe Americans gave details of the proposal.   Arms control working groups, headed by Paul Nitze for theAmericans and Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev for the Soviets, also movedtoward a compromise on counting the number of cruise missilesaboard warplanes.   The Americans proposed that certain air bases be designated fornuclear-tipped cruise missiles, with every warplane stationed therecounted as carrying an agreed number of weapons, said the U.S.official.   The two sides have set to a limit of 6,000 warheads apiece. Eachbomber carrying gravity bombs and Short-Range Air-Launched Missileswould be counted as one warhead.   But negotiators have not agreed how many warheads to count asbeing aboard each warplane. The Americans want to ``discount'' thenumber, counting each heavy bomber as carrying 10 cruise missiles,whereas the Russians would put the number closer to 20.   Soviet officials complained that the United States had rejecteda Soviet proposal to resolve another sticking point, verifyingproposed limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles.   Roald Sagdeyev, a Soviet scientist who has advised Gorbachev onarms-related issues, told a news conference that the U.S. Navy wasblocking progress by sticking to its policy of refusing toacknowledge whether or not a submarine or ship carries nuclearweapons.   Sagdeyev said the Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal foran experiment to determine whether nuclear-missiles can be detectedaboard ships by measuring neutron and gamma ray emissions.   Reagan and Gorbachev will issue their joint communique as thesummit winds up. They had one more business session scheduled forWednesday and then a departure ceremony on Thursday.   Another senior U.S. official, who also demanded anonymity, saidthe statment would be issued Wednesday or Thursday, depending onthe pace of talks senior negotiators were holding.   In addition to the planned exchange of the ratifiedIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty and progress in the STARTtalks, the two sides signed a handful of lesser agreements onTuesday.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his Soviet counterpartEduard A. Shevardnadze signed agreements on prior notification ofballistic missile tests and for an experiment to tightenverification techniques on a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to150 kilotons.   The head of the U.S. Information Agency, Charles Z. Wick, andSoviet Culture Minister Vasily Zakharov signed a protocol extendingfor another three years a cultural agreement signed in 1985. Otheragreements were signed covering transportation, civilian atomicreactor programs, radio navigation, fisheries and maritime rescue.</TEXT></DOC>
