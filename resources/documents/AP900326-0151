The group provides free counseling to relatives of murdervictims and plans to lobby for legislation to change the criminaljustice system.   Cuomo, the group's founder and executive director, wasFournier's sister. Fournier, a 17-year-old vocational high schoolstudent, was stabbed, stuffed in a trash can and left to die byHorton.   The case of Horton, who escaped while on furlough from prisonand attacked a Maryland couple, became a highly publicized issueduring the 1988 presidential campaign. Then-candidate George Bushused it to criticize Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' record on crime.   Joey Fournier Victim Services already offers counseling inLawrence in the northeastern section of the state, where Fourniergrew up, and wants to open centers in other sections ofMassachusetts.   About 20 to 30 people attended Monday's opening, including Duaneand Phyllis Hotchkiss of Saugus, whose 19-year-old son Brian wasslain in 1989 in Lynn.   ``I'm determined that our son's death is not going to be invain,'' said Hotchkiss, who donated $100 to the group. The groupneeds to raise another $100,000, said Cuomo, who would not say howmuch has been raised.   Counseling ordinarily costs about $100 a session, but noteverybody can afford it and not all health insurance plans coverit, said Cuomo.   Cuomo's voice wavered as she read the names of victims whosefamilies were present.   ``One tragic result of violent crime is the lasting effect ithas on the victim's family. I know my family will never be thesame,'' said Cuomo, who is no relation to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.   In addition to offering counseling, the headquarters will serveas the center for a coalition of victim support groups, includingParents of Murdered Children, the Young Adult Sibling Group andVictims for Victims.   The Joey Fournier group has already introduced bills to repealthe state's criminal records law, which shields criminal recordsfrom public scrutiny.   The organization also has submitted legislation to limit thegovernor's powers to commute sentences and another measure torequire ``truth in sentencing'' so that convicted criminals willactually serve the time of their sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
