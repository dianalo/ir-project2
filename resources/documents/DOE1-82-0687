Between1975 and 1985, 462 newly diagnosed patients were treated at the Children'sHospital of Philadelphia; 207 (45%) tumors arose in the posterior fossaand 255 (55%) appeared supratentorially. A wide variety of histologicalsubtypes were seen, each requiring tumor-specific treatment approaches.These included primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 86, 19%), astrocytoma(n = 135, 30%), brainstem glioma (n = 47, 10%), anaplastic astrocytoma(n = 32, 7%), and ependymoma (n = 30, 6%). Because of advances in diagnosticabilities, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, between 60% and 70%of these patients are alive today. Diagnostic tools such as computedtomography and magnetic resonance imaging allow for better perioperativemanagement and follow-up, while the operating microscope, CO{sub 2} laser,cavitron ultrasonic aspirator and neurosurgical microinstrumentationallow for more extensive and safer surgery. Disease specific treatmentprotocols, utilizing radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, have madesurvival common in tumors such as medulloblastoma. As survival ratesincrease, cognitive, endocrinologic and psychologic sequelae become increasinglyimportant. The optimal management of children with brain tumors demandsa multidisciplinary approach, best facilitated by a neuro-oncology teamcomposed of multiple subspecialists. This article addresses incidence,classification and histology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, pre-,intra- and postoperative management, long-term effects and the team approachin posterior fossa tumors in childhood. Management of specific tumortypes is included as well. 57 references.</TEXT></DOC>
