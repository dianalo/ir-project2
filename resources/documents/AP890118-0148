Baker IIIsaid today the United States and the Soviet Union are close toagreement on verification procedures for two long-pending nucleartest ban treaties.   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that when allwork on the two treaties is completed they will be submitted to theSenate for ratification.   Baker, whose confirmation as secretary of state is virtuallyassured, said he believes verification problems on the 1976 PeacefulNuclear Explosions Treaty are ``completely resolved.''   And he said verification procedures are ``close to beingresolved'' on the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty which would establisha limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests.   Testifying on the second day of his confirmation hearings, Bakeralso agreed to a proposal by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., todiscuss in private Biden's ideas on revising and implementing thecontroversial War Powers Act which provides a mechanism for Congressto reverse a presidential decision to commit U.S. forces to combator meet the threat of combat.   But, declaring that ``I don't want to pursue this under falsecolors,'' Baker said there are many in government ``who feel verystrongly that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, including thepresident-elect.''   Biden said failure to try to reach a compromise on the issue will``lead to an impasse every single time'' a president decides tocommit U.S. forces.   ``If that's your position, I can assure you there will be nobipartisanship,'' Biden said.   But Biden said there may be ways to address the constitutionalissues and still leave a voice for Congress. Baker said he would bewilling to pursue the matter.   On another subject, Baker said the Bush administration willmaintain a high standard of insisting on human rights protectionaround the world, whether abuses are committed ``by governments ofthe left or of the right.''   Responding to questions, Baker said he believes the Bushadminiration will move to combat the environmental hazards poised byacid rain in ``a coordinated and responsible way.''   ``I think you'll see a new approach toward acid rain from thisadministration,'' Baker said, noting Bush's campaign promises on theissue.   He indicated Bush will not move precipitously, however, andunderscored the need to deal with acid rain ``from a national andinternational standpoint.''   He told senators: ``You have my commitment to work at theproblem, because I think it is a very serious matter.''   In testimony on Tuesday, Baker promised regular consultationswith congressional leaders and asked for bipartisan support inreturn.   ``In order to succeed we simply must work together,'' Baker saidTuesday. ``That is the verdict of history and that is the verdict ofrecent experience.''   Baker ended the first of two days of confirmation hearings beforethe foreign relations panel with the endorsement of virtually everymember.   Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the panel will vote on theBaker nomination Thursday morning, one day before Bush is sworn inas president. The full Senate will act later.   Baker, on Tuesday, used such words as ``prudence,'' ``realism''and ``caution'' to describe the proper U.S. attitude to thestartling economic and foreign policy changes championed by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   And he refused to commit the incoming Bush administration toresuming nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union by anyspecific date, even though senators repeatedly urged him to do so.   One member, Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., noted that Bush ran forpresident in large part on his experience in handling foreign policyand arms control issues, contrasting himself favorably with DemocratMichael Dukakis.   Biden said it appeared odd to him that Bush and Baker should nowcontend they need an extended period to review the propernegotiating positions at arms control talks.   The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons havebeen recessed since November, and Baker said the newadministration's approach to them is among several key policy areasthat are ``under review.''   Baker also said he believed the strategic talks should be pursuedon their own merits and not be linked to other issues, includingagreement on reducing conventional arms.   The United States should welcome Gorbachev's reforms and anypositive change in Soviet human rights, foreign policy and defensepostures, Baker said.   But he cautioned: ``The talk is different, but the forcestructure and policies that support far-reaching interests andclients have not changed commensurately. Many of those policies andthose clients are hostile to American values and threaten ourinterests and our allies. That's a reality.''</TEXT></DOC>
