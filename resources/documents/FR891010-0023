OSHA has receivedseveral requests for an informal public hearing. Accordingly, pursuantto section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act, OSHA has scheduled informal public hearingsto begin on November 14, 1989 in Washington, DC and on December 5, 1990in Houston, TX. Through those hearings, the Agency expects to obtain testimonyand other information pertinent to the issues which are raised in the hearingrequests, in the notices of intention to appear, and at OSHA's initiative.In particular, OSHA solicits testimony, with supporting information, onthe issues presented below.<ITAG tagnum="85">Issue andplusmin;1: Regulation of Permit Spaces in Industries for whichIndustry-Specific Standards have been Issued</ITAG>Certain commenters [Exs. 14-7 and 14-20] have stated that industry-specificstandards which address permit space hazards would supersede the proposedgeneric standard. In particular, those commenters state that employerswhose confined space entry operations are addressed by industry-specificstandards, such as the telecommunications standard, should not be requiredto implement the permit system set out in the proposed generic standard.OSHA solicits testimony, with supporting information, on the extent towhich the generic standard need not apply where industry-specific regulations(please identify) address permit space hazards. What provisions, if any,of the proposed standard should apply where OSHA has existing industry-specificstandards? What criteria should OSHA use in determining where to applythe generic standard when the industry-specific standard has gaps in coveragefor confined space entry? What would be the anticipated costs and benefitsof applying the generic standard to employment otherwise regulated by industry-specificstandards?<ITAG tagnum="85">Issue andplusmin;2: Coverage of Construction, Agriculture and MaritimeEmployment</ITAG>Some commenters [Exs. 14-38 and 14-44] have suggested that the scope ofthe proposed rule be expanded to cover all construction, agriculture andmaritime employment because, they state, employees in those industriesare exposed to permit space hazards but are not protected from those hazardsby the existing standards. OSHA solicits testimony and supporting informationregarding the extent to which increased regulation of permit space workin construction, agriculture and maritime employment would be appropriate.Should any such additional protection be provided through this rulemakingor through separate rulemakings which cover the other industries? Whatcriteria should OSHA apply in determining how to regulate confined spaceentry in those industries? What would be the anticipated costs and benefitsof applying the provisions of the proposed standard to those industries?What provisions of the proposed standard should be applied to these industries?What provisions should not be applied?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;3: Employee Participation</ITAG>A commenter [Ex. 14-38] has requested that OSHA revise the proposed standardto require active employee participation in the design and implementationof permit space programs. OSHA seeks testimony and supporting informationregarding this suggestion. The Agency is especially interested in informationon those permit entry programs where employees have active roles in programdesign or implementation and in those programs which have procedures fortaking into account employee feedback and suggestions. What mechanismsfor employee participation seem to work? What is it about those employeeparticipation programs that has made them successful? What has been theexperience with employee participation in the development and implementationof confined space entry programs? What are the costs and benefits of employeeparticipation programs?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;4: Accuracy of Monitoring and Testing Devices</ITAG>OSHA is concerned that the accuracy of atmospheric monitoring and testingdevices may be adversely affected by humidity or other factors. The Agencyseeks testimony, with supporting information, on the extent to which monitoringand testing devices have proven to be unreliable, or reliable, in adverseconditions. What types of devices pose the greatest difficulties? Whatare the specific problems and situations where those problems occur. Whattypes of devices provide the best results when exposed to various adverseconditions? Which features cause those devices to be better? To what extentis operator training or skill a factor in monitoring and testing results?How can employers ensure that monitoring and testing devices are properlyused, maintained and calibrated?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;5 Permit Space Identification Guidelines</ITAG>A commenter (Ex. 14-44) has suggested that OSHA provide nonmandatory guidelineswhich would help ``small employers'' to identify permit-required confinedspaces, identify and evaluate hazards and either develop effective entryprocedures, or decide to contract out permit space entry work. Should OSHAdevelop such guidelines? OSHA requests testimony with supporting information,on this question. In addition, OSHA requests that hearing participantswho support the publication of guidelines submit testimony, with supportinginformation, which addresses what the contents of any such guidelines shouldbe.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;6 Review of Entry Permit Programs</ITAG>As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule [54 FR at 24091 and 24092],OSHA anticipates that employers will generate information in the courseof implementing their entry permit programs, and will revise their programs,based on that information, to ensure that entrants are protected appropriately.OSHA has not explicitly required that employers review their permit entryprograms, because the Agency believes that compliance with the proposedrule will necessitate ongoing evaluation of program effectiveness. ShouldOSHA specifically require that employers review their programs and revisethem, as necessary? Should the Agency set criteria for the review of entrypermit programs? Should OSHA, for example, specify how frequently employersshall review their programs? Should the Agency require that employers implementadministrative mechanisms for evaluation of programs? What criteria shouldOSHA set for the operation of those mechanisms?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;7 Reevaluation of a Work Space</ITAG>Based on concerns raised by a comment, (Ex. 14-45) OSHA is consideringif it should provide guidelines (or examples of typical circumstances)which indicate when work spaces would be reevaluated to comply with proposedandSection; 1910.146(c). OSHA seeks testimony, with supporting information,on this issue. In particular, the Agency would welcome examples of guidelinesand suggested criteria for reevaluation. The Agency would be especiallyinterested in receiving information about the circumstances which commentersexpect would necessitate reevaluation of a space.<ITAG tagnum="85">Issue andplusmin;8 Number of Spaces or Entrants to be Monitored by aSingle Attendant</ITAG>Based on concerns raised by a comment (Ex. 14-15), OSHA is consideringif it should limit the number of entrants, entry portals or permit spacesan employer may assign a single attendant to monitor, at any one time.OSHA seeks testimony, with supporting information, responding to the followingquestions: What limits would be appropriate? What criteria should OSHAset to guide employers in deciding how many attendants are needed to monitorentries and in determining where the attendant must be stationed in relationto the space monitored. How far should OSHA allow attendants to be fromthe entrant(s), entry portal(s) or space(s) they are monitoring?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;9 Attendant Reliance on Remote Radios</ITAG>A commenter [Ex. 14-34] has suggested that OSHA specifically permit theuse of radios so that a single attendant could monitor as many as 32 entrants.OSHA notes that if attendants are not permitted to enter permit spacesfor rescue purposes, an attendant's chief responsibility in a rescue situationcould be to summon the rescue team. In that case, the Agency recognizesthat the attendant's ability to detect that entrants need help and to summonthe rescue team, not the attendant's proximity to the entrants, could beof critical importance. To what extent should OSHA permit reliance on monitoringequipment in place of direct observation of entrants by attendants? OSHAseeks testimony, with supporting information, responding to the followingquestions: In what circumstances should this equipment be allowed? Howfrequently should attendants be required to check with the entrants? Howquickly should entrants be required to respond? Is television surveillancesufficiently protective? Would a Personal Alarm Safety System be sufficientlyprotective? What criteria should OSHA set for selection, use, maintenance,testing, repair or replacement of communication equipment?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;10 Rescue by Attendant</ITAG>Commenters [Ex. 14-47, 14-80] have stated that the proposed prohibitionof attendants entering permit spaces to rescue entrants is ``ill-advised''and ``not realistic.'' The commenter notes that most rescuer-fatalitieswere due to ``untrained, ill-prepared, emotional response on the part ofby-standers, friends, etc.'' The commenter notes that an attendant trainedand equipped in accordance with the standard is in the best position torescue an entrant quickly and that ``time is of the essence.'' Are therecircumstances where OSHA should permit attendants to enter permit spacesfor rescue purposes? OSHA seeks testimony, with supporting information,on this question.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;11 Rescue Team Qualifications and Training</ITAG>A commenter (Ex. 14-45) has suggested that at least two members of eachrescue team be trained in First Aid and be CPR-certified, that entry notbe allowed unless the in-house rescue is at full strength, and that anin-plant rescue team ``should not be credited as available'' if eithermember trained in first aid and CPR is unavailable. How many members ofexisting rescue teams have first aid and CPR training? What incrementalburden would fire brigades bear in order to comply with the rescue teamcriteria under consideration by OSHA? How many members do outside or in-plantrescue teams have? How many members are available at any given time? Towhat extent are rescue team resources tied up by a single rescue? Whatcriteria should OSHA set to indicate what a rescue team must do in orderto function effectively?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;12 Use of Outside Rescue Team</ITAG>A commenter [Ex. 14-45] has stated that OSHA should not allow the use ofoutside rescue teams unless it can be demonstrated that an outside teamcan and does arrive at workplace within four minutes of being summoned.OSHA notes that atmospheric hazards which deprive entrants of a safe airsupply generally pose life-threatening situations after about five minutes,though some hazards incapacitate or kill entrants even faster. OSHA seekstestimony, with supporting information, on the relative merits and disadvantagesof using outside or in-plant rescue teams. What criteria should OSHA setto guide employers in choosing between use of outside rescue teams andin-plant rescue teams? What should an employer provide to an outside rescueteam in the way of guidance, information, training, access to the workplaceor resources so that the outside rescue team has the necessary familiaritywith the employer's rescue needs and the ability to satisfy those needs?What kind of training should members of outside rescue teams have? Howcan the employer ensure that the outside rescue team's training, equipmentand performance are adequate to satisfy the rescue provisions of the proposedstandard? How quickly do outside rescuers generally arrive at accidentscenes and begin rescue efforts? How do outside rescue team and in-plantrescue team reaction times compare? Is it reasonable to bar use of an outsiderescue team which is more than four minutes away?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;13 Low-Hazard Permit Spaces</ITAG>Under proposed andSection; 1910.146(i), employers can authorize employeeentry into low hazard permit spaces without stationing an attendant outsidethe spaces. Based on concerns raised by a commenter (Ex. 14-45), OSHA seekstestimony, with supporting information, on how employers would documentthe decision that a certain permit space was a low-hazard space. OSHA alsoasks for testimony indicating where documentation would be kept, how longa period the documentation would cover, how long documentation would bekept and what provisions of proposed paragraphs (c) and (d) would applyto low-hazard permit spaces. What criteria should OSHA set to guide employersin determining if a given space could be treated as a low-hazard permitspace? What are the costs and benefits of applying proposed paragraph (i)?To what extent do the burdens imposed by the proposed paragraph offsetthe advantage of dispensing with the use of an attendant?<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;14 Employee Information</ITAG>Some commenters [Exs. 14-76, 14-77] have objected to the requirement inproposed andSection; 1910.146(c)(4) that employers post informational signsnear permit spaces because they consider such a requirement to be prohibitivelyexpensive and an invitation to unauthorized entries, particularly by teenagers,and to vandalism. How should such spaces be identified to protect employees?OSHA solicits testimony, with supporting information, on this question.The Agency encourages hearing participants to submit suggestions and informationon alternative approaches, as well as information on actual and projectedcosts of informing employees that a workplace contains permit spaces.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issue andplusmin;15 Access to MSDSs and Other Information</ITAG>Based on concerns raised by a comment [Ex. 14-11], OSHA is consideringif it should require that a copy of the MSDS for any chemical substanceinvolved in employee injury accompany the injured permit space entrantwho is given emergency medical service, in order to provide medical personnelwith guidelines for proper care. Is such a requirement appropriate? Thecommenter has also suggested that permits contain the names and telephonenumbers of responsible individuals who may be called on to make importantdecisions regarding a permit space rescue. What names and telephone numbersshould be included in an entry permit?OSHA solicits testimony, with supporting information, on these questions.The Agency would be especially interested in receiving examples of permitswhich contain MSDS data or which provide the names and telephone numbers(with back-ups) of ``responsible individuals.''Public Participation-Notice of HearingPursuant to section 6(b)(3) of the Act, an opportunity to submit oral testimonyconcerning the issues raised by the proposed standard, including economicand environmental impacts, will be provided at two informal public hearingsscheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. at places and on dates as follows:<T3>Washington, DC:</T3> November 14, 1989.
