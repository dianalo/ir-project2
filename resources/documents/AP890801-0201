Police reported Tuesday that six guerrillas were captured and 29escaped during a planned attack Sunday on La Pampilla oil refinery10 miles north of Lima. They said the rebels apparently planned toblow up oil tanks but security police spotted the guerrillas on anearby hill and police and marines were sent in by helicopter.   After a brief gunfire exchange police seized six guerrillas andidentified them as members of the Maoist Shining Path movement,officials reported.   The Shining Path has been waging an insurgency since 1980. Thegovernment says more than 15,000 people have perished in thefighting.   The pylon attacks are part of the rebels' strategy of isolatingLima from the rest of Peru.
