The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since 1955,dropped nearly one-third of their 63 seats in the 128-member TokyoMetropolitan Assembly.   National issues, such as an unpopular new sales tax, dominatedthe Tokyo election and it was considered a sign of the party'sprospects in the vote July 23 for half the seats in Parliament'supper chamber.   If parliament is dissolved over public discontent with thegovernment, the large Liberal Democratic majority in the morepowerful lower house also could be at risk later this year.   Although the Liberal Democrats won 43 seats in the Tokyo assemblyin Sunday's election, the opposition Socialist Party nearly tripledits strength to 29.   ``The tax and the question of political reform ... had theireffect on our assemblymen,'' said Yasunosuke Daigo, an 11-termLiberal Democratic member of the city assembly. Daigo, a membersince 1947, lost his seat.   Ryutaro Hashimoto, party secretary-general, described the resultas a ``total defeat'' and said: ``We must study it, and use it as alesson as we prepare for the national elections.''   Along with 29 Socialist members, up from 11 in the outgoing127-seat assembly, seven Socialist-backed independent candidateswere elected, giving the party a total of 36 votes.   Komei, or Clean Government, won 26 seats, the Communist Party 14and the Democratic Socialist Party three. Four minor parties got oneseat each and independent candidates without Socialist backingcaptured two seats.   Opposition parties hold a combined 85. In the last assembly,their total was just one more than the Liberal Democrats.   ``Things are going to change,'' said Keiko Chiba, a member of thenational parliament's upper house, in a speech at Socialistheadquarters congratulating a party candidate.   Many Socialists attributed the party's gains to voterdissatisfaction with the Liberal Democrats rather than Socialistpolicies.   ``After all this time under the LDP administration, the votersdecided they could no longer sit by and watch in silence,'' saidTakako Doi, party chairwoman.   Ichiro Shimizu, a Tokyo ward politician, said: ``Much of the votethat went to us was anti-LDP.''   The ruling party's popularity has suffered from the Recuitinfluence-buying scandal, which reached the highest ranks of theestablishment and forced the resignation a month ago of PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita, and a sex scandal afflicting hissuccessor, Sousuke Uno.   Before the Tokyo elections, several Liberal Democratic leadersacknowledged the possibility of a loss but said they hoped to win atleast 50 seats. When the results came in, party leaders said theyhad underestimated the effect of the scandals and opposition to thenew 3 percent sales tax.   ``This isn't a question of right or left,'' said Asae Uemura, whowon an assembly seat on the Socialist ticket. ``It's an angryreaction from the wallets of mothers, like me, who must do the dailyshopping.''   She said opposition to the tax, imposed April 1, was ``tens andtens times more important than the scandals.''   Uno is plagued by reports that he kept several paid mistresses.He denies the reports.   He also blamed the tax for his party's defeat. Although the primeminister is party president, the Tokyo branch asked him to stay outof the municipal campaign.   Representatives of several party factions, including two formerprime ministers, were reported to have agreed last week that Unoshould resign for the good of the party.   About 5.18 million people, or 58.7 percent of Tokyo's eligiblevoters, cast ballots, up from 53.5 percent in 1985, when the lastcity election was held.   Thirty-three women were among the candidates this time, and 17won.</TEXT></DOC>
