<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-73-0225 </DOCNO><TEXT>Calculation methods for absorption heat pumps and heat transformers aredescribed and graphically demonstrated in enthalpy-concentration charts.Special attention is payed to the estimation of pressures, temperatures,heat factor and circulation ratio. Every unit involved - generator/rectifier,absorber, condenser, heat exchangers, pumps and expansion valves - describedin detail. Mass- and energy flows are graphically calculated. Efficiencies,especially for absorber and generator, are based only on temperatures.These efficiencies take into consideration the varying absorber and generatortemperatures which should be exploited. Approximate values of temperaturedifferences, circulation ratio, heat factor and efficiencies for differentrunning conditions are given. Calculation examples for the absorptionheat pump as well as the heat transformer illustrate the graphical method,which is especially suitable for preliminary calculations such as forinstance pre-projecting.
