 Although RISCs offer bothadvantages and disadvantages in real-time processing (See SystemsIntegration, July, Page 34), systems integrators are discovering significantadvantages in applications that are compute-intensive, as opposed to highlyevent-driven applications.andM;Although most analysts give Mips Computer Systems Inc.andP;  the edge in the RISCarena, the embedded real-time RISC market seems to present a differentpicture.andP;  Because the real-time RISC market is still relatively new,analysts' projections aren't available, but Motorola Inc.'s 88000 RISC chipset seems to be gaining the most interest among developers of real-timeoperating systems and kernels.andM;One reason for the 88000's appeal is, no doubt, the fact that many developersare already familiar with Motorola's 68OX0 line and, therefore, porting tothe 88000 is easier than porting to other RISC chips.andP;  But the 88000 offersother features that facilitate adapting the chip to real-timeimplementations, such as register scoreboarding, a small register set andrelatively easy programmability in assembly language.andM;Also to Motorola's advantage, the other major supplier of general-purposemicroprocessors-Intel Corp.-was late to market with its RISC chips.andM;Because Intel's RISC products, the i860 and 80960, are relatively new, it'stoo early to predict how those chips will fare in the real-time market.andO;Intel regards its 64-bit 1860 as a workstation RISC chip that isn't optimizedfor realtime control.andP;  tasks.andP;  The 80960, on the other hand, is optimized forreal-time control tasks and is well-suited for embedded real-timeapplications.andM;Intel plans to port its iRMK real-time kernel to the 80960 within the nextmonth.andP;  Other real-time software suppliers, although expressing interest inthe chip, are taking a wait-and-see stance and haven't announced schedulesfor porting to the 80960.andM;Embedded designandM;Most real-time applications are embedded.andP;  Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'sAm29000 RISC chip enjoys more popularity in the real-time arena than it doesin the general-purpose workstation arena, because it was specificallydesigned for embedded configurations, Another factor in its favor was thatthe Am29000 was one of the first generally available RISC chips.andM;The Am29000 offers a variety of features that facilitate real-timeimplementations, including a three-operand i n s t r u c t i o n set, goodinstruction suppon for C and a good memory architecture that includes anonboard memory-management unit (MMU).andP;  In fact, AMD claims that the Am29000delivers 80 percent of its peak performance without using cache memory-adecided advantage when implement ing real-time executives.andM;Mips Computer enjoys the lion's share of the RISC work station market, inlarge par cause it's a supplier to Dig Equipment Corp.andP;  Like the 88000, Mips'R3000 has a relatively small register set (32 integer, 32 floatingpoint),which gives it an advantage over register-rich RISC chips in real-timeimplementations.andM;However, Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  dominates the systems-level market with itsPrecision Architecture RISC machines.andM;Although certain to be one of the surviving four or five RISC chips, SunMicrosystems Inc.'s SPARC is generally perceived more as a UNIX-workstationengine than as an embedded real-time processor.andP;  In addition, the SPARCarchitecture has a few features that impair real-time implementations, suchas its window register scheme.andM;JMI Software Consultants completed a port of its C Executive real-timeoperating system kernel for the SPARC architecture last fall but, as of thisspring, the company had not received any orders for the software.andM;Assembly vs.andP;  CandM;Most real-time software is written in either assembly or in the high-level Clanguage.andP;  In general, assembly provides better performance, while C is mucheasier to program with.andP;  However, C provides a much higher degree ofportability and speeds porting from one chip to another.andM;Until recently, the assembly vs.andP;  C controversy was particularly heated inthe embedded real-time arena.andP;  For example Ed Rathie vice president of JMI,states&quot;Ninety percent to 95 percent of any program should be written in ahigh-level language.andP;  Our philosophy is to get it running in C, measure it,and only where it's slow do we bother working with assembly language.&quot;andM;JMI's C Executive is a real-time operating system kernel that runs onapproximately 20 different microprocessors, including RISC chips.andO;Ninety-five percent of C Executive is written in C.andM;Rathje adds: &quot;Implementing real-time software on a RISC platform via assemblypresents a much higher likelihood of introducing errors.&quot; competitive edgeandM;However, the majority of leading real-time software vendors, most notablyReady Systems, have written their realtime software in assembly to gainperformance advantages.andM;The first RISC chip that Ready ported its popular VRTX real-time operatingsystem to was Advanced Micro Devices' Am29000.andP;  For that port, the companystuck with assembly.andP;  However, future ports to other RISC chips will be in aC version of VRTX.andM;Ready's strategic marketing manager, Rich Blomseth, adds that, after they dothe ports, they'll check the performance of the code and maybe rewrite partsof it in assembly language to increase performance.andP;  The company's goal is tomake the underlying language transparent to users.andM;Blomseth adds that the performance differences between assembly and C may notbe perceptible, depending on the quality of the compiler.andP;  As a result, theassembly vs.andP;  C debate may be subsiding.andP;  Says Andreas Schreyer, productmanager for RISC products at Motorola, &quot;With RISC, performance differencesbetween assembly and C are shrinking because compilers are being optimized,particularly C compilers.&quot;andM;Discussing C compilers, Larry Weber, vice president of software developmentat Mips, adds, &quot;It's easier to achieve assembly level code perfection on aRISC machine than on a CISC machine.andP;  As a result, the need for assemblylanguage decreases.&quot;andM;Companies mentioned in this article Advanced Micro Devices Inc.andP;  901 ThompsonPlace Sunnyvale, Calif, 94088 (408) 732-2400andM;Digital Equipment Corp.andP;
