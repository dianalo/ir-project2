(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former member of PTL's board ofdirectors said today that Jim Bakker deserved every bonus hereceived while at the helm of the television ministry and religioustheme park.   Evelyn Spencer, testifying in PTL's $52 million lawsuit againstBakker, his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart, saidshe and other board members consistently voted unanimously in favorof bonuses for Bakker.   ``If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. Spencer, pastorof The House of Truth Church in Oakland, Calif.   According to IRS figures presented in court today, Bakkerreceived $278,000 in salary in the fiscal year ending in May 1987,plus $1,167,000 in bonuses.   Under cross-examination, Ms. Spencer could not recall theprecise salary of Bakker while she was on the board from November1985 to March 1987.   Bakker was expected to testify later today. The trial began inbankruptcy court in September and was adjourned for about a monthbefore resuming Monday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.   In his opening statement Monday, Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis toldthe court the case against the Bakkers boiled down to allegationsthey mismanaged the PTL television ministry, which went intobankruptcy three months after Bakker resigned in March 1987 amid asex-and-money scandal.   But Hovis said he would show that the Bakkers' salaries wereauthorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyedproperly donated by the ministry, and the cash advances they weregiven reimbursed.   Salaries and benefits received by the PTL founders, he said,were not only legal and properly approved but also earned.   But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among otherlegal actions, including bankruptcy court, Hovis said he may beunable to provide precise documentation.   ``A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he said.   In a separate hearing Monday morning on PTL's bankruptcy case,Reynolds said he wants to see how the proposed sale of the PTLministry shapes up before considering whether to liquidate thetroubled television ministry and its Heritage USA theme park nearFort Mill.   Reynolds postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of severalmotions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11bankruptcy to Chapter 7. If those motions are granted, it wouldmean Heritage USA and other ministry assets would be sold by animmediate auction rather than by an arranged sale.   The judge said at a hearing last month he would hear the motionsto convert to Chapter 7 if no buyer were found for Heritage USA.Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick has since signed a contractwith PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to buy Heritage USA for $115million.</TEXT></DOC>
