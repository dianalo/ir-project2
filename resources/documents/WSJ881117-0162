Now, it turns out that the Indonesian official who triggered the dispute has a personal interest in such a reallocation.    Abdul Rauf Suhud, chairman of the Asahan Authority, which oversees the $2.1 billion smelter, justified his demand -- which he backed up by cutting off aluminum exports to Japan -- on national-interest grounds. He told a news conference last month that Indonesia deserved a bigger quota than the 41% that coincides with its equity stake because of its &quot;very generous&quot; contributions to the project, such as tax incentives and water for power generation. Financially, Mr. Suhud complained, the Indonesian government &quot;virtually doesn't get anything&quot; from the smelter.    The aluminum-export ban has angered the Japanese partners, who call it a breach of contract. The stoppage, say businessmen and officials from both countries, has harmed Jakarta's ties with Tokyo, Indonesia's largest source of loans and investment. The cutoff was imposed in July, although two subsequent shipments to Japan have been allowed.    What Mr. Suhud didn't mention at the October press conference was his involvement in a private venture that seeks eventually to process nearly one-third of the smelter's production. Called P.T. Asahan Aluminum Alloys, or P.T. AAA, it consists of a new Indonesian company, a new Guernsey, Channel Islands, company, and an existing Indonesian trading company. According to documents filed with Indonesia's Capital Investment Coordinating Board, Mr. Suhud represents both the new companies in dealings with Indonesian agencies.    There is no evidence that Mr. Suhud, a former industry minister and former deputy chairman of the investment board, is a shareholder in P.T. AAA. But the documents establish that he and an Indonesian banker working in Singapore were central to setting it up, with assistance from other Asahan Authority officials.    Given current Indonesian domestic use of Asahan aluminum and contract commitments to the Japanese partners, P.T. AAA wouldn't have access to sufficient aluminum unless Japan is forced to accept a cut in its quota. P.T. AAA's $28 million plant, to be built within three years near the smelter, is to make aluminum metal for construction materials. Approval for the plant was given by the investment board on Aug. 24 -- the day after Mr. Suhud publicly confirmed that he had suspended monthly shipments from the smelter because of the dispute with the Japanese partners.    Although Mr. Suhud's connection with the venture has changed the complexion of the Japan-Indonesia quarrel, his connections with the private companies have received scant public attention in Indonesia. Japanese officials working on the Asahan dispute are reluctant to discuss the matter for fear of aggravating it.    The Asahan chairman has asserted he has full support from the government for his tough line on the Japanese. &quot;I couldn't do this sort of thing {suspending exports} if it wasn't acceptable to the government,&quot; he told the news conference.    Officials at the Finance Ministry, Indonesia's official shareholder in the smelter, say they are working to resolve the dispute quickly but decline to comment further. But some government officials privately say they are upset that Mr. Suhud is involved in a private downstream project while at the same time he is a government official overseeing the smelter.    Mr. Suhud declined repeated requests by this newspaper to comment on his role with the venture. P. Samadiono Samadikun, secretary of the Asahan Authority, says the chairman wants to comply with government instructions not to comment at present &quot;on any subject whatsoever&quot; connected with aluminum.    The Japanese partners in the smelter also decline to comment on any aspect of the dispute. Half of Japan's 59% stake is jointly held by 12 companies handling aluminum; the other half belongs to the Japanese government.    Until they learned of Mr. Suhud's connection with the private processing venture, the Japanese were baffled by his actions, especially the export ban that is costing Indonesia export earnings at a time of high world aluminum prices.    The smelter is supposed to give Indonesia 75,000 metric tons a year, or a third of production, whichever is less. Mr. Suhud argues this formula covers only the aluminum project's obligation to the Indonesian government, and he claims the rest of output should be divided in accordance with shareholdings. That means Indonesia would get 60% of output -- an increase Japan has vehemently resisted.    For the investors in P.T. AAA, there may not be a hurry to get the venture moving; it doesn't plan to begin commercial production until late 1990. But there is a need for Indonesia and Japan to resolve their argument quickly.    Besides causing a big stock buildup at the smelter, harming bilateral ties and cutting Jakarta's export earnings, the aluminum-export ban is damaging Indonesia's investment climate, businessmen from both countries say. They add that relations between Mr. Suhud and the Japanese are so sour that it will be almost impossible for the two sides to work together again. </TEXT></DOC>
