(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The pilots of a small commuter plane thatburst into flames before crashing into a passenger ramp toldinvestigators late Sunday the fire erupted so quickly they hadlittle time to make an emergency landing.   Carl Carlson, the pilot of Horizon Air Flight 2658 from Seattleto Spokane, and Mark Hilstad, the co-pilot, made the comments toNational Transportation Safety Board investigators in a closed-doormeeting. The comments were overheard by reporters outside.   NTSB officials and the pilots declined to comment to reportersat the meeting a an airport hotel here.   Carlson and Hilstad related the events aboard the de HavillandDash 8, which crashed Friday into a passenger concourse loadingramp at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.   All 40 people aboard the aircraft survived the crash, whichoccurred after the engine caught fire following takeoff amidovercast skies.   Less than a minute after the fire report, the crew reportedcontrol problems and attempted an emergency landing. Forty secondslater, the plane came to a stop next to the B Concourse afterclipping three passenger ramps. The burning plane was drenched infirefighting foam and the blaze was quickly extinguished.   Of the 19 aboard who were injured, three remained in hospitalsSunday, hospital officials said. One was in serious condition.   Carlson, of the Portland area, told officials he didn't knowthere was a fire on the plane until it made a final turn for therunway during its attempt to make an emergency landing. A 40percent to 60 percent loss in torque in the right engine promptedhim to head back, according to the remarks overheard by reporters.   After Hilstad told him the landing gear was down, as they madetheir final approach, Carlson heard someone say over the towerradio frequency that the plane was on fire.   As they started the descent, Carlson and Hilstad said, theyrealized they were going too fast and they appeared to be comingdown too high to adequately slow down. However, they said, they hadno choice but to land.   Carlson said he thought he was still in a comfortable range tomaneuver the plane to a stop.   Hilstad said he and Carlson applied full force to the brakes andlocked the emergency brake in an effort to stop, but could notavoid hitting the ramp.   NTSB investigators have said that an initial review of tapes oftower communications with the plane indicated the first mention offire came from another aircraft that was not immediately identified.   ``You've got a fire on that airplane, Horizon,'' the voice onthe tape said.   Hilstad described the fire as a big reddish ball of flameprotruding forward from the wing, and said it appeared while theplane was at about 2,000 feet, going 205 to 230 mph.   At a news conference in Seattle late Sunday, NTSB member JosephT. Nall said fuel was spotted on the plane's wing by a passenger.   When asked if the leaking fuel could have caused an explosion,Nall said, ``That's speculation. We have no way of knowing that.   Investigators have an unusual videotape of the plane's landingfrom an airport camera. They also have found a panel that fell fromthe plane's burning right engine while it was turning to return tothe airport.   Carlson refused to discuss the crash Friday night when he wasreleased from a hospital after being treated for back pain. Horizonofficials said he had been told to make no public comment untilafter interviews with investigators.   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the wrecked plane may bemoved into a hangar Monday for closer scrutiny.   ``Had it not been for the quick application of foam and their(the fire crews') efforts, we could easily have lost 40 people,''Rick Smith, chief of the Port of Seattle Fire Department, saidSunday after watching the videotape of the crash-landing.   The videotape was made from a camera mounted permanently atopthe control tower, one of several around the airport, said CharlesBlood, Sea-Tac operations manager.   The jumpy black-and-white tape shows the burning craft initiallyas two tiny specks of light leading a thin trail of black smoke.The craft approached, descended irregularly and touched downroughly.   Then it careened past a couple of racing firetrucks and across agrass median onto a taxiway that runs parallel to the concourse.   The plane stopped short of a Boeing 747 parked in its path.Blood did not know if anyone was aboard the jumbo jet.   There was damage to three jetways, a baggage car, a truck andthe roof of the concourse where a piece of propeller landed, saidMargo Spellman of the airport staff. Three flight gates were closedby damage.   Found Saturday was a 2-by-3-foot metal door that gives mechanicsaccess to the right engine. Nall said it fell off the burningengine pod and was found a mile and a half from the airport.   The plane's turboprop engines were made by Pratt andamp; WhitneyCanada.   Horizon president John Kelly said it was the airline's thirdincident in 19 months involving the engines on the Dash 8 model butthe first passenger injuries in the company's seven-year history.   Last June, an engine fire in a Horizon Dash 8 was detectedshortly after takeoff from Sea-Tac and the plane landed safely atnearby King County International Airport. In September 1986 anotherplane returned to Sea-Tac when an engine malfunctioned and had tobe shut down shortly after takeoff.   Officials at the de Havilland division of Boeing Canada andPratt andamp; Whitney Canada said in telephone interviews they knew of norecurrent problems.</TEXT></DOC>
