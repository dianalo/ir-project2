The outcome could influence who rules theworld skies.   Delta, United, American and TWA all are vying for piecesof the once-proud carrier. TWA over the weekend offered tobuy its historic rival outright and then sell some of theleftovers to American. Northwest says it would like a pieceof Pan Am, too.</RE><TEXT>   The battle illustrates where the new front lines are beingdrawn in the airline industry: the global market.   Competition for international routes and facilities isintense. At major airlines, both in the U.S. and abroad,there is new emphasis on global operations. U.S. airlineshave spent about $2 billion in the last two years buyinginternational routes and related assets. British Airways PLCopened a new $120 million terminal at New York's John F.Kennedy International Airport in April, and hired formerBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for the grandopening. In February, United named its firstinternational-affairs vice president. United is now askingBoeing Co. to explore building a mammoth 650-passenger planefor use on its overseas routes; the plane would be more than20% larger than the biggest jets today. Last month, JapanAirlines issued bonds in the U.S. for the first time, torenovate and expand a cargo facility in New York.   The emergence of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and AMRCorp.'s American Airlines as major international carriers hasalso begun to tilt the competitive balance in favor of theU.S., and thus frighten foreign carriers accustomed tocompeting with the weak outfits that Pan Am Corp.'s PanAmerican World Airways and Trans World Airlines had become.In addition to their financial strength, United and Americanalso enjoy an advantage that TWA and Pan Am never had --large U.S. route systems from which they can gatherpassengers for international flights. United and American'scombined operating revenues were twice those of Pan Am andTWA combined in 1990.   Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and foreign carrierssuch as Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa GermanAirlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Singapore Airlines Ltd.,All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd., and Japan Airlines are among theother heavyweights in this fight. A $190 million United offerfor Pan Am's Latin America division and Delta's proposed $260million purchase of Pan Am's New York-Europe service,Frankfurt hub and other assets are one way U.S. carriers aretrying to grow. (Those deals are now jeopardized by TWA ownerCarl Icahn's offer to buy Pan Am.) The foreign airlines oftenbenefit from government subsidies, as well as from politicalprotection as their nations' flag carriers.   &quot;All carriers are now racing to position themselves forthe new shape of the airline industry,&quot; says Patrick Murphy,U.S. deputy assistant transportation secretary.   The stakes are huge: control of the world's skies. By theyear 2000, global passenger air traffic is expected to nearlydouble, while the U.S. market is expected to increase by amore modest 50%. By the year 2000, world-wide passenger airrevenue will also nearly double, to almost $300 billion fromabout $150 billion last year. Just one route cansignificantly affect the bottom line: Within a month ofstart-up in January, United's Chicago-Tokyo service becameits most profitable, with annual revenue projected at $255.5million.   Airlines' very survival is on the line. Despite theexpanding market, the number of carriers is expected toshrink substantially, with world air travel eventually to bedominated by a relative handful of megacarriers and theirsubsidiaries.   &quot;The market,&quot; predicts Lufthansa's chairman, Heinz Ruhnau,&quot;is going to be oligopolistic.&quot;   The contest for global dominance is being played out inunusual and complex ways, sometimes in exotic locales, withpolite bureaucratic language obscuring a bare-knuckledstruggle. Earlier this year, a donnybrook between the U.S.and British governments over the transfer of Pan Am and TWA'sLondon operations to United and American, respectively,grabbed the limelight, but behind-the-scenes fights are goingon from Bangkok to Bonn.   Yet as airlines race toward the 21st century, the systemfor regulating international aviation remains mired in the1940s. International aviation remains tightly controlled bycomplex, anachronistic government-to-government agreementsoften designed to keep foreign competition at a minimum.Though some of the new pacts allow for increased competition,the system has the free market in a stranglehold, criticssay.   In a blow to the consumer, foreign governments often forcecompeting airlines to charge higher fares or offer fewerflights than they otherwise would. Germany and Japan, forexample, are famous for blocking discounting efforts bycarriers such as Pan Am and NWA Inc.'s Northwest. Critics saythat it is time to junk the system and replace it withderegulation. &quot;We're looking for a wholesale transition intoa more open market,&quot; says U.S. Transportation SecretarySamuel Skinner.   Countries have resisted the idea of open markets in anattempt to defend their carriers. American Airlines, forexample, gained entry into Manchester, England, only afterheavily courting local officials over the protests of BritishAirways. African governments have charged royalties toforeign carriers.   &quot;The whole underpinnings of international aviation aretied up in protectionism,&quot; complains Donald Carty, executivevice president of finance and planning at American Airlines.&quot;Countries have viewed it as important to have a flagcarrier. Well, not very many of these same countries haveflag chemical companies.&quot;   United knows this well, too. For months it has beentrying, to no avail, to get Australian government clearanceto fly nonstop service between Sydney and Tokyo. The marketis one of the biggest for Qantas Airways Ltd., the Australianflag carrier. &quot;The world is changing rapidly in aviation,&quot;says Cyril Murphy, United's new vice president ofinternational affairs. &quot;Australia is sitting there on thetail end.&quot;   Meanwhile, when United, Northwest and Delta startedincreasing the number of flights to Thailand, Thai officialsjunked their longstanding air pact with the U.S. and demandedthat U.S. carriers cut their service. The Thais subsequentlybacked down but are still concerned about the U.S. threat tothe business of Thai Airways International Ltd.   The U.S. isn't spared criticism. Lufthansa, whichcurrently serves 12 U.S. cities, wants to go head-to-headwith Northwest Airlines' nonstop service between Detroit andFrankfurt, but the U.S. won't hear of it. U.S. officials sayLufthansa would get more service if the German governmentwere to liberalize its pricing policy so as to allow moreU.S. discount fares.   Gernot Huebl, a Lufthansa vice president, says U.S.aviation policy is so restrictive, it's &quot;like the East bloc.&quot;Until Lufthansa was granted nonstop service to Washington,D.C., in 1986, the company's chairman, Mr. Ruhnau, would jokethat it was odd the carrier could fly nonstop to Moscow butnot to the capital of its closest ally.   For the time being, U.S. government officials are stuckwith the current bilateral system, which basically translatesas &quot;you let us into Paris, we'll let you into New York,&quot; saysRep. James Oberstar, chairman of the House aviationsubcommittee and a critic of the status quo.   But the horse-trading frequently gets nasty, especially asAmerican and United flex their muscle abroad. In May, theSpanish government blocked American from starting service toMadrid from Miami, thus sending the airline scrambling torebook 1,700 passengers on other carriers. Spain saw too manyU.S. planes headed its way: United and Continental Airlines,a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., also had plansfor new service to Spain. The dispute came to a head when theU.S. threatened to cut off flying rights to New York andMiami for Iberia Airlines of Spain. In the end, the threeU.S. carriers, plus Delta, got the nod to go into Spain,while Iberia was allowed to fly to three additional U.S.cities of its choice. Iberia will now serve 11 cities in theU.S.   Airport space -- both inside and outside the terminal --often becomes a flash point with a shortage of landing slots,terminal space and other facilities in key cities such asLondon, Frankfurt and Tokyo. The U.S. and Korea have been atloggerheads for more than a decade over cargo warehouse spacefor U.S. carriers at the Seoul airport. A deal recently wasworked out: U.S. carriers will get new warehouse space, theright to install their computer reservation systems in Koreantravel agencies and other goodies, while Korean carriers overthe next four years will get long-sought permission to fly toChicago and five other cities of their choice.   Similarly, after years of pleading for TWA and Pan Am,those two carriers and new entrant American Airlines gotpermission to expand check-in facilities at Geneva's mainairport -- but only after the U.S. government gave Swissairthe nod to fly to Los Angeles.   Peter Luethi, general manager for Swissair's North Americadivision, explains: &quot;You have Pan Am and TWA who have been inSwitzerland for the last 25 years. Then you have a new U.S.entry that is coming in like it's the Second Coming. You haveone carrier from your own nation. You wonder if you're anAmerican colony. You feel you're overpowered.&quot;   Such concerns are bound to intensify. If its agreementwith Pan Am goes through, Delta could take over Pan Am'sSwitzerland operations.   Japanese officials, having signed an agreement with theU.S. to provide greater access, assigned U.S. airlines Tokyolanding and takeoff times that were virtually unusable.United, for example, got a slot that required its flight toleave Washington, D.C., at 3 a.m. -- while competing againsttwo Japanese carriers departing during waking hours. UnitedParcel Service of America Inc. was mostly offered mid-morningdeparture times, while competitors Japan Airlines and NipponCargo Airlines, an All Nippon Airways unit, left at morelucrative evening hours to achieve next-day delivery. TheU.S., in response, blocked Japanese cargo flights to Chicagountil American carriers got better slots, which they did.   Fares are a particularly sore subject. Last August, theGerman government rejected a string of proposed Pan Am farecuts, including a senior-citizen discount fare. Inretaliation, U.S. officials nixed a $399 round-tripNewark-Berlin fare proposed by Lufthansa. The Germangovernment's moves were &quot;particularly galling,&quot; says JeffreyShane, assistant U.S. transportation secretary for policy andinternational affairs, because the German government hadagreed to approve more fare cuts in return for Lufthansa'swelcome to Charlotte, N.C.   Andreas Kuechel, transportation consul at the Germanembassy, says the German government hopes &quot;the phase ofirritation is closed.&quot; Yet, the pricing issue probably won'tbe resolved until Lufthansa gets to fly to more U.S. cities.The issue is still up in the air.   Talks between the U.S. and India have been stymied inrecent years because of a so-called &quot;tax cheat case.&quot; Underan obscure domestic law, the Indian government has tried tofine Pan Am several million dollars for flying out of Indiain 1977 a wealthy Indian citizen who allegedly hadn't paidhis taxes. For a time, India also blocked Pan Am from takingits local earnings out of the country. Following the lastround of U.S.-India talks in 1989, Indian officials let PanAm take the money away after angry U.S. negotiators warnedthat Air India wouldn't be able to increase its U.S. serviceif the Indian government persisted.   The question of Pan Am's liability for its formerpassenger's taxes is still pending before the Indian courts.Meanwhile, Air India officials are frustrated because theysay the U.S., for protectionist reasons, won't let themincrease the number of U.S. cities Air India serves. U.S.calls for an open market are &quot;a lot of hogwash,&quot; says ArunaMascarenhas, deputy director of planning and internationalrelations at Air India. &quot;We wanted to serve Chicago, New Yorkand one point on the West Coast, and this was too much forthem. . . . It's so anti the spirit of deregulation.&quot;   While their governments squabble, many carriers are takingsteps to ensure their own survival through mergers,acquisitions and marketing alliances designed to improveeconomies of scale. Some have broadened their domestic bases.For example, British Airways acquired British Caledonian, adomestic U.K. carrier, and Air France took over two Frenchcarriers, UTA and Air Inter.   Others pursue overseas partnerships. KLM purchased aminority stake in Northwest Airlines. There's a trilateralcrossownership pact between Swissair, Delta and SingaporeAirlines. Iberia Airlines bought a large stake in AerolineasArgentinas. Qantas holds a large stake in Air New Zealand.Scandinavian Airlines System has marketing alliances witheight airlines in North America, Europe, Asia and SouthAmerica, including Continental Airlines in the U.S.   Airlines go to great lengths to win an advantage. Lastyear, United Airlines' Chairman Stephen Wolf flew to Korea towangle additional ticket-counter space for United at theSeoul airport.   The chief executive presented Korean officials with glossyphotos of frantic United customers waiting in long lines ateight ticket counters. He also took along exhaustive data toprove his airline was being unfairly treated. The approachworked: In May, Korean officials granted United five morecounters.   In the midst of all the jockeying for position, someairlines are good bets to dominate the industry: United,British Airways, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, American, Deltaand Air France. The future of others, including Northwest andAll Nippon Airways, is less certain. The strength of thesecarriers is their home bases. Big carriers with smalldomestic turfs -- KLM, Korean Airlines and Singapore -- facea more uncertain future as second-tier airlines.   The prospects are particularly dim for some. In the U.S.,survival itself is at stake for TWA and Pan Am. Swissair, AirIndia and Air New Zealand will probably remain niche players.Airlines of the former East Bloc may not crack the market atall. Christopher Mularuk, general manager, North America, atLOT Polish Airlines warns: &quot;Unfortunately, by the time manyEastern European airlines have put their act together and gottheir operations up to speed, they may find it's too late.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
