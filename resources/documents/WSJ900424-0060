A rally that had exploded briefly last week on OPEC'sannouncement of a May 2 meeting in Geneva resumed yesterdayin European trading and then spread to the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   In European spot and futures trading, North Sea Brentcrudes advanced as much as 50 cents a barrel. In U.S. futurestrading, crude prices were up as much as 25 cents a barrel.Firm crude futures helped lift other fuels as well with theMay contract for unleaded gasoline up 1.61 cents a gallon tosettle at 63.54 cents.   &quot;It seemed that the Brent market got the thing going,&quot;said William Hinton, a Stotler andamp; Co. energy futures broker.&quot;It was the typical pattern before an OPEC meeting,&quot; headded, &quot;with the market running up in anticipation of theresults.&quot;   The major anticipated result of the meeting of OPEC'smarket monitoring committee -- all 13 oil ministers areexpected to be there -- is that there will be some curbing ofthe overproduction that brought oil prices to a near-collapseearlier this month. The idea is to achieve output reductionsover May and June, at least, to get past the second quarter,usually a weak period for oil demand.   Yesterday, the perception that OPEC will be able toachieve voluntary output reductions at least for those monthsappeared to be spreading among oil-market participants. Also,the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported thatleading Persian Gulf members may be prepared to agree to a 5%production cut if it is for all of OPEC. That would be equalto more than one million barrels a day.   There were also some technical factors at work in the oilmarkets yesterday. One trader noted that after the June WestTexas Intermediate contract hit the $19.10 level on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange &quot;there was very aggressive buying.&quot;   Many traders later took profits. Still, the June WTIcontract settled 25 cents higher at $19.07 a barrel. Julycrude was up 20 cents to $19.51.   Further evidence of firming crude prices came in thefields, where several refiners increased postings $1 a barrelto $18 for West Texas Intermediate. Amoco Corp., which hadbeen posting $16 a barrel, increased the prices it will payfor WTI by $2 to $18.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures prices settledhigher and the nearby contracts rose their limits in responseto a bullish inventory report issued by the AgricultureDepartment on Friday that disclosed that fewer bellies werestored than expected. According to the report, as of April 1there were 97.5 million pounds of frozen pork bellies instorage, while most analysts had expected 100 million poundson hand. &quot;The bullish interpretation of the total frozen porkbellies and higher hog prices at the terminal markets helpedto push hog prices higher,&quot; said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analystwith A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis. Charles Levitt, ananalyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said theoverall action in the market was robust &quot;as we continue tofeel the effects of strong demand for all meats during thefirst quarter.&quot; Cattle futures prices closed mixed in thewake of the bearish government report that showed that morecattle was placed onto feedlots during March, which ledAugust and October contracts lower. &quot;The report showed anaggressive market pace during the first quarter, which helpedthe nearby June contract, but also showed a larger placementfigure of young animals on feedlots in the first quarter thananticipated,&quot; said Mr. Levitt.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply, more thanerasing Friday's gains. The May contract declined 5.85 centsa pound to $1.8965. The May contract on Friday rose 1.75cents. The approach of the first day for the issuance ofnotices on May 1 to deliver the concentrate against Mayfutures contracts may have contributed to the selling,according to Judith Ganes, senior analyst for Merrill Lynch,New York. Technical considerations also played a factor inthe substantial drop, as liquidation of May contractssignificantly increased when the price dropped below $1.90,she said. However, Ms. Ganes added, the fundamentals of themarket didn't appear to justify the severe price decline. Areport late Thursday showed the amount of supply moving outof Florida to the retail sector was more than one milliongallons a week, apparently indicating that consumerresistance to higher prices wasn't as strong as had beenexpected, Ms. Ganes said. Also, supplies may tighten incoming months, she said. The Florida orange crop hasn'trecovered from the Christmas freeze and Brazil's harvest isexpected to be lower than last season's record output, Ms.Ganes said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum futures prices rose sharply,helping to pull up gold. July delivery platinum rose $7.70 anounce to $494.30. June gold was up $2.20 an ounce to $382.10.May silver eased 0.80 cent an ounce to $5.10. Traders havebeen preoccupied in recent weeks, said Nina Lipton, researchmanager for the Platinum Group International, an industrialgroup. Yesterday &quot;they took a look at their charts and sawthat platinum has been oversold, particularly in the wake ofthe sharp sell-off in gold in late March and they decided tobuy contracts,&quot; she said. Fundamentals also favor the buyingside, Ms. Lipton noted, particularly the strong demand forthe metal for environmental use, such as in automotivecatalytic converters. Another analyst noted that tradersstill remain nervous over political tensions in South Africa,which is the world's major supplier of platinum. Gold washelped by the rise in platinum as well as a softening in thesecurities markets, which could stimulate some demand forgold as a safer haven, he said.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices were firm. The May contract rose1.30 cents a pound to 75.31 cents. Today is the first day onwhich notices to deliver cotton against the May contract willbe issued and traders bought back contracts they hadpreviously sold, causing prices to rise, said an analyst. Henoted that there is a tightness of supplies of better gradesof cotton in the U.S. Also, he said that Australia, asignificant supplier of good quality cotton to the worldmarket, has recently experienced heavy rains, which may havehurt the quality of some of the cotton. Another analyst notedthat the rains in Australia came at a time when China isperceived to have strong import needs and remains a potentialbuyer of cotton. Expectations that U.S. economic growth willcontinue to improve should keep domestic mills actively usingcotton, the analyst said. Industrial stocks have been down tominimal levels for several months, causing mill demand forcotton to continue strong, according to the analyst.</TEXT></DOC>
