Another milestone is just now occurring: The isolated patches ofsea sandwort are developing into plant communities.   ``Gradually sand drifts into this mat, and it forms a sanddune,'' Fridriksson explained. Seeds of lyme grass germinate in thesand, sheltered by the sandwort.   The black-backed seagull uses the patch for nesting. ``It bringsin food for the young, and the excrement from the young and theadult bird fertilize the plant,'' he said.   Interactions like that are the culmination of nearly 30 years ofthe development of life on Surtsey, Fridriksson said.   And he expects the island to continue to develop in wondrous,unpredictable ways.   ``Whenever you come to Surtsey, you always find something new,something surprising which you haven't expected,'' he said. ``It'sa revelation. And it directs one's thoughts to the origin of lifeon Earth _ and to the fate of life.''   For life on Surtsey eventually will disappear.   ``Surtsey will become steeper and smaller,'' Fridriksson said.``Finally, it will become just a rock that will be broken up by thewaves. . . .   ``And that will be the end. Those who study that will be able totell how a society is built up _ and how it's destroyed.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 16</NOTE></DOC>
