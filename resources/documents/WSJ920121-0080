Closely held Quorum, Menlo Park, Calif., said it willdemonstrate at a news conference tomorrow a softwaretechnology it calls a &quot;compatibility engine,&quot; which willserve as a kind of translator between Macintosh programs andthe Unix operating software used on most workstationcomputers. The aim, Quorum said, is to allow corporate usersto run popular business programs on workstations, which havetended to be used for more technical applications.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This brings productivity software over to theworkstation,&quot; said Rikki Kirzner, an analyst at DataquestInc., a research firm. While the Quorum software could hurtApple by eliminating the need for a Macintosh for somecomputer users, she said, it will also be a boon for Applebecause it will encourage independent software houses to keepwriting for the Macintosh, knowing that the software willhave an additional market among workstation users. &quot;It's athreat and a blessing for Apple,&quot; she said.   Jay Freidland, Quorum's marketing vice president, said thecompany will use its technology in two programs that will besold later this year. One program, called Latitude, willallow writers of Macintosh software to rewrite their programsto run on a specific Unix machine. The rewritten applicationslet the computer user manipulate the Macintosh program usingUnix's &quot;graphical user interface,&quot; the screen's symbols andwindows, rather than the Macintosh interface.   Using the program, workstations will be able to process aMac program's graphics tasks as fast as a high-end Macintoshand will do a Macintosh program's mathematical calculationsthree to four times faster than a Macintosh can.   A second program, called Equal and due out in the secondhalf of 1992, will allow workstation users to run anyMacintosh program directly on a workstation. While theprogram will run Macintosh disks as is, it will run thesoftware at a slower speed than programs rewritten withLatitude, the company said.   Quorum, founded in 1989, said that it signed jointmarketing and development contracts with workstation makersSun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc., both ofMountain View, Calif. A spokesman for Apple, Cupertino,Calif., said the company is still evaluating the Quorumsoftware and couldn't comment.   Quorum, however, said it has been discussing itstechnology with Apple from the beginning and doesn't believeApple will pose any legal obstacles.</TEXT></DOC>
