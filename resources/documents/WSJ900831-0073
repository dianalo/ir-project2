The institute's report is among thefew efforts made to determine the prevalence ofworkplace-related illnesses nationwide.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The report claims that occupational disease is asubstantial problem that isn't sufficiently recognized,&quot; saysHoward Frumkin, director of environmental and occupationalhealth at Emory University, Atlanta, and an adviser to theinstitute.   The report also says the nation's regulatory apparatus foroccupational health is in disarray. Standards for exposure tomany dangerous materials are much more lax for the workplacethan for the community at large, the report notes. It alsosays funding for the U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration and the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health, as a percentage of the federal budget,fell sharply through the 1980s.   Diane Porter, assistant director of NIOSH, said the study&quot;covers an important area that we need to look at.&quot; She alsonoted that while the National Centers for Disease Controltracks such infectious diseases as AIDS and measles on aweekly basis, no national reporting system tracksoccupational disease. A spokesman for OSHA said agencyofficials hadn't yet evaluated the study.   The institute said it based its fatality report on datafrom the National Center for Health Statistics and onestablished methods to estimate the proportion of deaths frommajor diseases that could be attributed to workplaceexposures. For instance, it estimated that 5% to 10% of thenation's 483,000 cancer deaths in 1987 were related toprevious occupational exposures to dangerous substances,while 1% to 3% of 964,000 cardiovascular disease deaths and2% to 4% of 164,000 pulmonary disease fatalities were causedby such exposures. The estimate of total occupational diseasedeaths ranged from 47,377 to 95,479.   Such numbers are inherently imprecise, the instituteacknowledged, because the onset of many occupational diseasesoccurs many years after the initial exposure and doctorsoften can't distinguish between illnesses that begin in theworkplace and those that develop from other causes.   The institute said a broad effort by industry, medicine,labor and government is necessary to develop more informationabout the problem as well as effective programs to addressit.</TEXT></DOC>
