It's called the Portable Pension Plan, and though it's been kicking around labor circles, it has yet to be transformed into a broad popular cause, the sort of issue politicians talk about in outdoor rallies and at Rotary Club luncheons. A handful of presidential candidates are poised to do just that in the next few months.    &quot;It will be a big theme in my campaign,&quot; says former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, who is seeking the Democratic nomination. &quot;I'm going to be talking about it,&quot; says former Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware, who is seeking the Republican nomination. So will two other Democratic contenders, former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who stressed the concept in a lecture at the University of Florida Law School last month, and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.    New ideas are the coin of the realm in modern politics, and the men who are girding for the 1988 presidential campaign are already searching for them, hoping that these ideas will dress up their campaigns, burnish their image and attract large blocs of voters to their cause.    That's why the Portable Pension Plan has such great appeal. It sounds fresh, it seems fair, it has a catchy slogan: &quot;Tie the pension to the worker, not the job.&quot; And it appeals to the majority of Americans, including the 75 million baby-boom voters who are chronic job switchers and who constitute the most receptive market for new political ideas. &quot;These voters are motivated by self-interest, and here is a problem that no politician has addressed,&quot; says Paul Leinberger, a St. Paul, Minn., management consultant.    The evolution of the portable pension from proposal to political buzzword illuminates the process by which policy ideas germinate in Washington and then burst forth in full flower as part of the popular debate. But though presidential candidates search for new ideas in the belief they set them apart from other political figures, make them seem creative and transform their candidacies into a movement, they seldom come up with the ideas themselves.    &quot;Every campaign needs someone from the outside to inject fresh lines of thinking,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;The pressure of a campaign schedule and the very act of campaigning makes it unlikely for the candidate himself to come up with a lot of new ideas.&quot;    The notion of portable pensions surfaced in a report by a commission appointed by President Kennedy. But it was given new life last year when Pat Choate, director of policy analysis at TRW Inc. and known as one of the capital's most prodigious producers and marketers of new ideas, managed to persuade the Democratic Policy Commission to include it in its blueprint for the future, &quot;New Choices in a Changing America.&quot;    Then Mr. Choate included it as one of the 45 new ideas in &quot;The High-Flex Society: Shaping America's Economic Future,&quot; a book he wrote with Juyne Linger, a TRW policy analyst. The book is selling briskly in Washington bookstores, particularly on Capitol Hill, even though it is receiving scant attention in the rest of the country. And he discussed it with several presidential candidates and then persuaded Mr. Hart, Mr. Babbitt, Mr. du Pont and others to make it part of their appeal in the first breath of the campaign.    &quot;Once the idea has taken off, it takes on its own life,&quot; he says. &quot;The candidates who seize it give it life, and then everyone else has to have a position on it.&quot;    Mr. Choate, 45 years old, grew up in Maypearl, Texas, a railroad junction of 150 people about 40 miles southwest of Dallas. He helped popularize the debate on improving America's infrastructure, claims credit for the idea of a capital budget for the federal government and provided Mr. Hart with his leading new idea of the 1984 presidential campaign, the Individual Training Account to help workers find new opportunities in a changing economy.    &quot;This is a guy who is full of good ideas,&quot; says Mr. du Pont. &quot;He sits around, thinks them up, offers them up and is willing to have anybody take the idea and run.&quot;    Some of the other ideas in his book -- Rep. Nancy Johnson (R., Conn.) bought 80 copies of it, gave them as a gift to members of her campaign finance committee and told them it was &quot;one of the really exciting books&quot; -- involve new approaches to child care, worker retraining, assistance to small businesses and ways to address the U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;But the good thing about the portable pension, the thing that makes it perfect for politics, is that you can describe it in two minutes,&quot; says Mr. Choate.    He estimates that only a quarter of U.S. workers are entitled to a pension, and a survey by Korn-Ferry, the human-resources research firm, showed that a quarter of executives aged 30 to 47 already have worked in four or more companies. A National Bureau of Economic Research study, moreover, found that workers who change jobs once after age 31 reduce the value of their pensions by more than a quarter.    President Reagan, in his legislative message accompanying his State of the Union address, urged Labor Secretary William Brock to examine making pensions portable. The debate among the presidential candidates, however, is likely to go considerably beyond that, and will deal with assuring that every worker has a private pension.    Mr. Choate's version of the idea has generated enthusiasm among a number of White House aspirants. &quot;It's got to happen, given the mobility of the work force,&quot; says Mr. Hart. Mr. Babbitt adds: &quot;I want to create mobility rather than restrict it. This issue relates to two things that are central to Democrats: productivity and equity.&quot;    The Choate plan calls for the creation of a portability fund, which could be administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the Treasury or the Social Security Administration. Matching tax-exempt contributions would be made by workers and employers, and workers would be immediately vested. Those moving to new jobs could deposit their pension money in the central fund or have it transferred to the pension plan provided by their new employer.    &quot;This appeals to younger people who are going to change jobs several times in their careers and to women who aren't always as permanent in the work force,&quot; says Mr. du Pont, who knows that as a dark-horse GOP candidate he has to offer unusual ideas to attract attention and support. &quot;But there's also an element of fundamental fairness to it: It secures for people what they have earned.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
