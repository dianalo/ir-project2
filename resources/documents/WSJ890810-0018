The Dow Jones industrials slid 13.09 points to 2686.08 in another day of heavy trading. Bond prices dropped following results of the Treasury's auction of 10-year notes. The dollar rose modestly.    Analysts said that although the price of many potential takeover target stocks climbed yesterday, the gains weren't enough to offset profit-taking as the Dow Jones industrials crossed the 2700 level in intraday trading. Traders said 2700 remains a psychological barrier for many investors since it's the last major hurdle before the record high of 2722.42. The price declines were exacerbated late in the day by computer-assisted sell programs.    The stock market also felt the effects of the cool reception given the Treasury's auction of $9.76 billion of 10-year notes. The prospect of gradually rising interest rates depressed stock prices.    The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost about three-quarters of a point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount, with about half the loss coming after the auction results were announced.    Yesterday's stock-price drop notwithstanding, many analysts still argue that it's only a matter of time before the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpasses the record it set in August 1987. The continued speculation in takeover stocks coupled with growing program trading activities will drive prices higher, they say.    The release yesterday of the Federal Reserve's &quot;beige book&quot; -- a summary of economic conditions around the country -- had little impact on markets. The summary said economic growth is slowing and that inflation doesn't seem to be posing a significant threat. That's about the way investors have been gauging the economy.    In major market activity:    Stock prices fell in heavy trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 209.9 million shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 876 to 636.    The dollar rose modestly against major currencies. In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.8975 marks and 139.15 yen, compared with 1.8925 marks and 138.75 yen Tuesday. </TEXT></DOC>
