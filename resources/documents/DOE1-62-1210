The authors established theperformance requirements for the undulator diagnostics. The resultingdesign incorporates electromagnetic beam-position monitors, &quot;pop-in&quot;target, steering, quadrupole trim, and vacuum pumping in a 4.0 cm longitudinalgap. The steering and diagnostics have been built with the design goalof aligning the electron beam to the optical mode of the cavity to betterthan one tenth (30 {mu}m) of an electron beam diameter.</TEXT></DOC>
