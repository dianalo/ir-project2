That's the case for Barry F. Sullivan, former chairman ofFirst Chicago Corp., who is being paid more in annualconsultant fees than what he earned as head of the 10thlargest bank in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   As a consultant to the bank, First Chicago said Mr.Sullivan is earning $780,000 a year and will do so until theend of 1994. Before retiring in December, Mr. Sullivan'sannual salary was about $770,000. The consulting agreementwas struck shortly before the 61-year-old Mr. Sullivan tookearly retirement to devote more time to community service andhis family.   In addition to the salary for &quot;consulting and advisoryservices,&quot; the bank is providing &quot;incidental benefits, suchas the use of a car, office space and secretarial support,&quot;First Chicago said in a proxy statement. The salary andbenefits are in addition to the $136,000 Mr. Sullivan willreceive in annual pension payments.   Mr. Sullivan is currently mentioned as a leading candidatefor the post of deputy mayor for economic development of NewYork City. A spokeswoman for First Chicago said Mr. Sullivanwould continue to receive the $780,000 annual salary even ifhe is employed elsewhere.   Although it's not unusual for senior executives to beretained as consultants upon retirement from a company,compensation consultants said it was rare for retiredexecutive to be paid more than when employed full-time. Thegoing rate for chief executives-turned-consultants is about$250,000 to $300,000 a year, they said.   A First Chicago spokeswoman said that although Mr.Sullivan was paid $770,000 in 1991, his annual salary ratewas $780,000, the same as what he will be getting as aconsultant. &quot;He is not getting a raise,&quot; she said. She alsonoted that Mr. Sullivan had not received an executive bonusfor two years. That cut his total cash compensation sharplyfrom 1989, when it was $1.3 million.   After Mr. Sullivan retired, there was public disclosure ofa First Chicago internal audit that criticized management forlax control over an executive who has been convicted foraccepting kickbacks. There have also been allegations thatthe executive had set up an illegal betting pool for bankmanagers at Mr. Sullivan's behest. First Chicago maintained,however, that Mr. Sullivan's retirement had nothing to dowith the disclosures.</TEXT></DOC>
