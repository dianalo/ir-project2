(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bold effort to start a U.S. companyaimed at denting Japan's manufacturing dominance in computer memorydevices has failed because American chip users would not helpfinance the venture, according to the venture capitalist whooriginated the idea.   ``I've given up,'' Pierre Lamond, a general partner at SequoiaCapital and co-founder of National Semiconductor Corp., said Tuesday.   ``I've been working on it since May. We gave ourselves atimetable and a limit, and we could not get any sizable industrialpartner to sign on the dotted line,'' Lamond said..   ``We had lot of promises, a lot of interest, but it was all talk,no action.''   Lamond's plan for a partnership to finance a memory chipstart-up, using $15 million cash from investors and $425 million inlease guarantees from U.S. chip users, was an attempt to wrest fromJapan some of the $5.7 billion worldwide market for DRAMs _ dynamicrandom access memory chips.   Those chips, in short supply for about a year, are criticalcomponents in desktop computers, printers and dozens of otherelectronic goods.   Some American computer companies have been forced to curtailproduction or raise prices because of the DRAM shortage and havecomplained that Japanese chip users get preferential treatment fromJapanese chipmakers.   Most U.S. chipmakers have dropped out of the memory chipbusiness, largely because Japanese companies in the late 1970s andearly 1980s sold chips at below-market prices to grab market share.   Only two U.S. companies, Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas andMicron Technology Inc. in Boise, Idaho, continue to make and sellDRAMs in the United States.   ``Although users of DRAMs complain about the treatment they'regetting from the Japanese, they're not willing to put their moneywhere their mouth is,'' said Lamond. ``...I guess they're satisfiedwith the Japanese as suppliers.''   Lamond had approached four computer makers affected by the DRAMshortage: Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Sun Microsystems Inc. ofMountain View, Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston and DigitalEquipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.   ``If I could not convince four major forward-looking companies, Idon't think I could convince other smaller companies,'' Lamond said.   Apple and Sun spokesmen said they had no immediate comment.Digital and Compaq were closed late Tuesday when contacted forcomment.   The worldwide DRAM market is expected to grow from $5.7 billionthis year to $10.5 billion by 1992, according to Dataquest Inc., aSan Jose, Calif., market research firm.   ``The Japanese have 90 percent of the worldwide market for onemegabit DRAMs,'' Lamond said, referring to the tiny chips that canhold 1 million bits of information. ``They're now assembling thenext generation, four megabit chips, and are expected to go intoproduction in 1990, and they'll probably grab 95 percent of thatmarket.   ``It's scary to be at the mercy of a single supplier,'' he said.``They will be able to throttle, help or injure any one of theusers. If they don't like a particular company, they won't ship toit. Or more likely, they'll say, `If you want DRAMs, you have to buyeverything else from us.'''   The proposed company, dubbed Megaram by Lamond, would haveemployed about 1,000 workers, he said, and attempted to reach $100million in sales by its third year.   Lamond sought $15 million in venture capital for Megaram'sinitial working capital. He wanted chip users to provide leaseguarantees for $125 million in chipmaking plant and equipment duringMegaram's first phase and $300 million over five years.   The chip users would have been liable for the leases only ifMegaram defaulted on its payment.   Lamond said the lease guarantee arrangement was one way to avoidthe high cost of capital, which has been a problem for U.S.technology companies competing with Japanese firms.   In return for the lease guarantees, the U.S. companies would havea ``priority call'' on the memory chips, which would be sold atmarket prices.</TEXT></DOC>
