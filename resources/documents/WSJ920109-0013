The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said yesterdaythat it had dropped the racketeering and tax charges againstthe defendants. Defense attorneys in the case have beenwaiting for months for the government to decide whether itwould retry the defendants, following an appeals courtdecision last summer throwing out almost all of theconvictions and ordering a new trial.</LP><TEXT>   The appeals court reversal was one of several last yearthat were seen by some as a repudiation of former ManhattanU.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani's zealous and flashyprosecutions of white-collar cases. Defense attorneys claimedthat Mr. Giuliani improperly used the Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations law, and the law's threat of stiffforfeitures, as a club to pressure defendants intocooperating or settling.   Although the appeals court decision would have allowed thegovernment to pursue the RICO charges again, the courtexpressed concerns about such an approach in a tax-fraud casesuch as that against Princeton/Newport, a defunct securitiesfirm. The appeals court also indicated that, at a new trial,the defendants would have to be allowed to show why theybelieved that the alleged tax violations at the heart of thecase weren't illegal.   Mr. Giuliani left office in 1989 to pursue a politicalcareer, and now is in practice as a lawyer in New York. Thecurrent U.S. attorney is Otto Obermaier. Because he was acriminal defense lawyer before taking office, Mr. Obermaierhas said he would not be directly involved in decisionsinvolving cases initiated before he arrived.   In announcing that it is dropping the charges in thePrinceton/Newport case, the U.S. attorney's office said itdidn't believe a retrial would be worth the effort. &quot;Thegovernment has already devoted substantial resources to thisprosecution,&quot; the office said. &quot;The government has determinedthat its prosecutorial resources should be spentinvestigating and prosecuting more recent activity.&quot;   Defense attorneys in the case praised the decision. Theyalso said the case would have been easier to defend in thewake of the appeals court ruling.   The government's decision means that all charges aredismissed against James Sutton Regan, the managing generalpartner of Princeton/Newport; Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul A.Berkman, general partners in the firm; and Steven B.Smotrich, Princeton/Newport's comptroller. The appeals courthad let stand the securities-fraud convictions of twodefendants in the case, Charles M. Zarzecki, aPrinceton/Newport general partner, and Bruce Lee Newberg, aformer junk-bond trader who worked for Michael Milken atDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   &quot;Mr. Regan and the others are overjoyed with the decisionto dismiss forever all the charges against them,&quot; saidTheodore V. Wells Jr., an attorney for Mr. Regan. He said Mr.Regan and the three other defendants who were cleared of allcharges are now private investors.   Messrs. Newberg and Zarzecki were sentenced to threemonths in prison but haven't begun serving the terms. Theycould seek reduced sentences in light of the government'sdecision to drop the case against their co-defendants, whoalso had been sentenced to begin serving prison time beforethe appeals court reversed their convictions.   Gerald Lefcourt, an attorney for Mr. Newberg, said thatwithout the RICO charges, the case brought against thePrinceton/Newport defendants &quot;was a borderline tax case.&quot; Headded, &quot;I've always viewed this as a case of Giuliani usingthe power of RICO and the power of a federal prosecution tobend or break&quot; defendants.   Mr. Giuliani couldn't be reached for comment. Hepreviously has said that the appeals court reversals were forreasons beyond his control, such as a judge's handling of acase or actions by the prosecutor at trial. InPrinceton/Newport, for instance, the appeals court said thatthe trial judge should have allowed the defendants to showthat they had made a &quot;good faith effort&quot; to comply with thetax law.   ---   UNION OFFICERS can be sued for violating union'sconstitution, court rules.   The decision by the federal appeals court in Manhattantoughens the measures union members can take to holdindividual officers responsible for alleged wrongdoing. Alower court had dismissed the lawsuit, which accused formerTeamsters President William McCarthy of misusing his unionposition to suppress dissent and to protect his politicalallies.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that a union'sconstitution is a contract between the members and the union,but the court didn't address whether individual officerscould be sued for violating the contract. The Second U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals answered that question in itsdecision this week.   Patrick Szymanski, an attorney in Washington for theplaintiffs, said the decision is good news for union members,who &quot;would prefer to go after individuals rather than theunion itself.&quot;   But James Grady, general counsel for the Teamsters, saidthe decision &quot;will open up the federal courts to anyone whois fired by a union to file a claim&quot; that the dismissal wasactually punishment for dissenting against union leadership.   Last month, the Teamsters elected reform candidate RonCarey as president, defeating supporters of Mr. McCarthy, whodidn't seek reelection.   (Shea vs. McCarthy, Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,Manhattan)   ---   MICHAEL BOUDIN to resign from federal bench in Washington.   The judge, a former high-ranking official in the JusticeDepartment's antitrust division and the son of the lateLeonard Boudin, a prominent civil rights lawyer, gave noreason for his resignation and declined to discuss it. Itbecomes effective Jan. 31.   Judge Boudin, 52 years old, was appointed a federaldistrict judge in December 1990 and recently was considered apossible nominee for the federal appeals court seat vacatedwhen Clarence Thomas joined the U.S. Supreme Court. ButPresident Bush is reported to have selected another nomineefor that seat.   Friends of Judge Boudin said the appeals court situationhad no bearing on his decision to step down. &quot;At an earlystage, long before the {appeals court} opening, he wasanguishing over whether the personal costs were too high tokeep this job,&quot; said Robert Pitofsky, a law professor atGeorgetown University Law Center and a friend of JudgeBoudin. The judge's wife, Martha Field, and their threechildren live in Cambridge, Mass., where Ms. Field teaches atHarvard Law School.   ---   NOTED: Marvin E. Frankel, formerly a federal districtcourt judge, became a mediator for Lawyers Mediation ServiceCorp., which is based in Tucson, Ariz. Mr. Frankel, who willcontinue as a partner in the New York law firm Kramer, Levin,Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel, said he has been interested inmediation for some time. &quot;Some way of mitigating the expenseand burden of our adversarial process would be desirable,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
