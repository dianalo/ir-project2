The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbyingorganization, the Tobacco Institute, comes during the week markingthe 25th anniversary of the first of the surgeon generals' reportsto declare smoking a health hazard.   A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted someanti-smoking groups are pushing for a ``smoke-free'' society. ``Toachieve their purposes,'' she said, ``anti-smokers are turning tocensorship, harassment, punitive taxes and intrusion into personaland private decision-making.''   ``The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, donot support these anti-smoking efforts,'' she said.   The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm ofHamilton, Frederick andamp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned1,500 Americans over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. Therespondents included 1,099 nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said.   An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they aresatisfied with current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposedoutright bans in the workplace or public areas. The survey has amargin of error of plus or minus three points.   Among the findings:   _Eight of 10 people believe it should be left to employers andtheir employees to determine workplace smoking rules withoutgovernment interference.   _About 74 percent believe restaurants should be allowed to offersmoking and non-smoking sections to customers.   _Fifty-three percent believe excise taxes _ amounting to about athird of the price of a pack of cigarettes _ should stay the same(38 percent) or be reduced (15 percent).   _Fifty-seven percent believe cigarette advertising restrictionsshould remain the same (38 percent) or be lifted entirely (23percent), as opposed to banning all advertising.   The institute's newspaper ads declared ``Enough is enough!'' andsaid that meant ``enough taxation ... enough legislation ... enoughcontrol ... enough censorship ... enough harassment ... enoughdiscrimination'' against smokers.</TEXT></DOC>
