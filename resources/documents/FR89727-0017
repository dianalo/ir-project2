Authority </ITAG>Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604 (a)(2)) authorizes EPA to designatea use of a substance as a significant new use. EPA makes this designationby issuing a SNUR after it has considered all relevant factors, includingthose listed in section 5(a)(2). Under section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA, personsmust submit a significant new use notice to EPA at least 90 days beforethey manufacture, import, or process a substance for a significant newuse. Persons subject to a SNUR must follow the same rules and proceduresas persons who are required by section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA to submit a PMN.Section 26(c) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2625(c)) authorizes EPA to take actionunder other sections of TSCA with respect to categories of chemical substances.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Introduction </ITAG>A. Summary This rule amends 40 CFR Part 721 by establishing new Subparts B, C, andD and by amending Subpart A. Other amendments to Subpart A were recentlypromulgated at 53 FR 28358 (July 27, 1988). In Subpart A this rule establishes definitions of terms found in SubpartsB, C, and D. Some of the terms were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 22, l986 (51 FR 15104), and of April29, l987 (52 FR 15593); other terms were added in response to commentsmade on the proposed rules. The new terms were included because they werenecessary for the practical functioning of Subparts B, C, and D. None ofthe new terms modifies the substance of the proposed rules. Subpart B establishes standard significant new use designations. Each standardsignificant new use will apply to a specific substance only if it is citedin the SNUR for that specific substance. EPA may designate as significantnew uses activities other than those for which standard designations areprovided for in Subpart B. When the standard designations contained inSubpart B do not provide an adequate description of a significant new use,EPA will develop an appropriate designation and use it in the SNUR forthe specific substance. If EPA expects to use the same language in futureSNURs, EPA will amend Subpart B to include the new use designation. Thehazard communication provisions contained in Subpart B were proposed onApril 22, 1986 (51 FR 15104). All other provisions contained in SubpartB were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 29, 1987 (52 FR 15594). Subpart C establishes recordkeeping requirements which will apply for aspecific substance only if cited in the SNUR for that specific substance.EPA may designate recordkeeping requirements other than those for whichstandard designations are provided for in Subpart C. When the standarddesignations contained in Subpart C do not provide an adequate descriptionof a needed recordkeeping requirement, EPA will develop an appropriatedescription and place it in the SNUR for the specific substance. If EPAexpects to use the same language in future SNURs, EPA will amend SubpartC to include the new recordkeeping requirement. Subpart C was proposedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 29, l987 (52 FR 15594). Subpart D contains expedited procedures for establishing significant newuse requirements for certain new substances that have completed PMN reviewand are regulated by an order issued under section 5(e) of TSCA. SubpartD also contains criteria used to determine whether uses not identifiedin the PMN of substances which have completed PMN review and have not beenthe subject of a section 5(e) order will be considered candidates for aSNUR under expedited procedures. In addition, Subpart D contains a procedurethrough which a person may request limitation or revocation of SNURs whichwere promulgated under this expedited procedure. Subpart D limits the significantnew use designations that may be included in SNURs issued under the expeditedprocedures for non-section 5(e) substances. Subpart D was proposed in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 29, l987 (52 FR 15593). Subpart E was established in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 2, 1988 (53 FR 2845). It containsSNURs for specific chemical substances. B. Changes From the Proposed Rule As discussed above, the hazard communication provisions of this final rulewere proposed on April 22, 1986, and the remainder of this rule was proposedon April 29, l987. The following changes have been incorporated in thisfinal rule: 1. The proposed standard significant new use designations and recordkeepingrequirements in Subparts B and C have been modified to be consistent withthe standard provisions for section 5(e) consent orders which were developedin a public comment process announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 6, 1988. 2. This rule adopts most of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's(OSHA) hazard communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). EPA is not adoptingcertain parts of OSHA's hazard communication standard because they eitherare covered in other sections of EPA rules or are not applicable. EPA didnot adopt a requirement in OSHA's standard (pertaining to trade secrets)that the identity of the substance must be released to a physician or nurseduring a medical emergency. Instead, EPA has required that a person whocan provide treatment information when a person has been exposed to theSNUR substance be designated in the material safety data sheet (MSDS) andon the label. EPA received no comment on this issue. 3. On April 29, 1987, EPA had proposed a program under which it would issueimmediately effective final SNURs for new chemical substances subject toTSCA section 5(e) orders, or which met certain hazard and exposure criteria.This final rule significantly changes the proposed approach to providea greater opportunity for public comment. EPA will issue SNURs under oneof three procedures. The three mechanisms are: direct final rules, immediatelyeffective interim final rules, and notice and comment rulemaking. EPA intendsto use the direct final rulemaking process as its usual method for issuingnew substance follow-up SNURs, but reserves the right to use immediatelyeffective interim final or notice and comment rulemaking as appropriate.Direct final rulemaking is the same as a procedure that is used by EPAfor rulemaking under the Clean Air Act. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 23, 1982 (47 FR 27073), EPA discussedstreamlining the State Implementation Plan (SIP) review process. In thatnotice, EPA announced that it would promulgate certain SIP revisions forwhich no public comment was expected using an ``immediate final rulemaking.''EPA has decided to adopt the same process for issuing SNURs under thisrule because EPA does not generally anticipate public comment on theseSNURs. The process adopted for SNURs under this rule as ``direct final rulemaking''works as follows: EPA will issue a document in the final rule section ofthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> which contains the final SNUR. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> document will state that the SNUR will be effective60 days from the date of publication, unless, within 30 days from the dateof publication, EPA receives written notice that someone intends to submitadverse or critical comments. If, within 30 days from the date of publication,EPA receives notice that someone intends to submit adverse or criticalcomments, EPA will withdraw the direct final rule by issuing a documentin the final rule section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. EPA will simultaneously issue a proposed rulein the proposed rule section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The proposed rule will establish a 30-day commentperiod, and will identify any objections to the rule of which EPA has beennotified. EPA will then consider any comments received and decide eitherto issue a final rule promulgating the SNUR or withdraw the proposal. EPA believes that this process provides an improved opportunity for publicparticipation consistent with the objective of providing for prompt promulgationof SNURs to follow-up on new chemical substances. EPA will generally usethis approach because it significantly reduces the time, relative to noticeand comment rulemaking, during which a person may legally engage in a significantnew use before the SNUR effective date. This option saves EPA resourcesbecause routinely only one <T4>Federal Register</T4> document is required to establish a SNUR. Immediately effective interim final rules will work as follows: These SNURswill be issued as interim final rules and will be effective on the dayof publication. A 30-day comment period begins on the day after publication.The rule ceases to be in effect 180 days from the date of publication unlessduring that time EPA issues a final rule addressing any comments received.This option provides the greatest possible reduction in the period duringwhich a person may legally engage in an activity EPA intends to regulateas a significant new use because the rule is immediately effective andenforceable. EPA expects to use interim final rulemaking for SNURs whenEPA has reason to believe that someone is likely to engage in the significantnew use before the rule would go into effect under direct final or noticeand comment rulemaking. EPA will explain its reasons when it uses thisprocedure for a specific SNUR. EPA expects to follow notice and comment rulemaking procedures to issueSNURs in cases where it expects adverse or critical public comments ona SNUR. While this option maximizes the period during which a person mayengage in the activity EPA intends to regulate under a SNUR, it also givesmaximum public notice, and ensures a full period to address any significantissues. A full notice and comment cycle requires publication of two documents,and thus will cost more than the direct final method in most cases. 4. EPA had proposed that information submission requirements be imposedunder TSCA section 8(d) for all substances, and under section 8(a) forsome substances, subject to SNURs on an expedited basis. EPA has not adoptedthis aspect of the proposal. Such rules will be issued on a case-by-casebasis as necessary, and consequently will not be issued under the expeditedprocedures of this final rule. 5. EPA's response to comments document (available in the public docketfor this rule) supplements this preamble by addressing the public commentsreceived on all aspects of this rule.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of the Final Rule </ITAG>A. Amendments to Subparts A and B: Standard Language Describing SignificantNew Uses Subpart A is amended to establish new definitions needed for the functioningof Subparts B, C, and D. The new Subpart B contains standard language whichEPA will use in designating certain activities as significant new uses.Using standard language will reduce potential confusion due to minor languagevariations from SNUR to SNUR. When EPA wishes to designate an activitydescribed by standardized language as a significant new use for a particularsubstance, it will list the substance in Subpart E and reference the appropriatestandard new use language from Subpart B. Subpart B now contains the followingsections:<ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.50 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.63 Protection in the workplace. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.72 Hazard communication program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.80 Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.85 Disposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.90 Release to water. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">andSection; 721.91 Computation of estimated surface water concentrations;instructions.</ITAG>When appropriate standard language is not contained in Subpart B, EPA mayamend Subpart B to add additional standardized language. This standardlanguage will establish a significant new use for a particular new chemicalsubstance only when it has been cited in a SNUR in Subpart E. EPA alsointends to use standard provisions in section 5(e) consent orders; thestandard SNUR language is designed to track the corresponding section 5(e)order provisions. In codifying standard language for designation of significant new uses,it is not EPA's intent to discourage persons subject to SNURs from proposingmore effective alternative approaches to limit exposure or environmentalrelease. EPA encourages manufacturers, importers, and processors to seekapproval of more effective alternative control measures under andSection;721.30. 1. <T3>Section 721.63 Protection in the workplace.</T3> This section designatesnew uses based on dermal and respiratory exposure and requires that employersdemonstrate that chemical protective clothing is impervious to the substance.Changes from the proposal are designed to enable the Agency to more preciselycite exposures of concern and protective measures. The rule provides anexclusion from the workplace protection provision for mixtures containinglow concentrations of the substance and establishes procedures personsmust follow if they discover that their customers are engaging in activitiesinconsistent with the provisions of andSection; 721.63(a). i. <T3>Dermal protection.</T3> Section 721.63(a) will be cited whenever dermalexposure is a concern. This provision establishes a performance-based approachto dermal protection. The language allows employers to determine whichemployees are reasonably likely to be dermally exposed by evaluating thework area. Each employer has the responsibility to select, provide, andenforce the correct use of the appropriate personal protective equipmentfor dermal protection. Employer selection of control measures may takeinto account engineering controls and work practices instead of, or inaddition to, personal protective equipment. Dermal protection applies onlyto persons who are reasonably likely to be dermally exposed. Reasonableand feasible engineering controls may often eliminate the need for personalprotective equipment because the ``reasonably likely to be exposed'' findingwill not be made. Under special circumstances EPA will cite the menu inandSection; 721.63(a)(2) to specify the type of personal protective equipmentthat must be used for dermal protection in addition to the performance-basedapproach. A menu of physical forms at andSection; 721.63(a)(6) allows theSNUR to establish controls appropriate to substances which have high vaporpressure and to which airborne exposures are likely as well as to substanceswhich have low vapor pressure and to which airborne exposures are unlikely,consistent with a section 5(e) order on which the SNUR is based. Section 721.63(b) exempts mixtures containing a concentration less thanor equal to a concentration specified in Subpart E of this Part for a substancefrom dermal protection requirements, but excludes from exemption mixtureswhich might concentrate above the exemption limit. The concentration specifiedwill ordinarily be one percent of the chemical substance (one tenth percentif the chemical substance is a carcinogen), which is consistent with thesimilar OSHA exemption, but other concentrations will be specified whenappropriate. This exemption is not intended to cover a case where the substanceis present in the mixture in concentrations greater than the level setin Subpart E of this Part, even though the airborne concentration of themixture may be less than the level set in Subpart E of this Part. EPA has added definitions for ``work area'' and ``workplace'' to SubpartA to clarify use of those terms in andSection; 721.63. EPA developed theperformance-based dermal protection provisions in response to commentsfavoring use of performance- based provisions whenever appropriate. EPAhas retained standard language for describing specific types of personalprotective equipment. EPA will cite this language when it determines thata particular type of personal protective equipment is essential for adequateworker protection. ii. <T3>Demonstration of imperviousness.</T3> EPA requires that employers demonstratethat chemical protective clothing is impervious to the substance underthe conditions and duration of exposure. EPA is allowing two methods to demonstrate imperviousness: (a) Actual testingof the chemical protective clothing by the employer, and/or (b) evaluationof the chemical protective clothing manufacturer's specification data.EPA expects the demonstration of imperviousness will address the totalenvironment to which the chemical protective clothing is exposed. EPA expectsthat factors affecting physical integrity such as abrasions, punctures,and tears will be considered. The employer must also consider penetrationand permeation by the substance under the conditions and duration of exposure.iii. <T3>Respiratory protection.</T3> Section 721.63 (a)(4) and (5) will becited when inhalation exposure to the substance is a concern, and willspecify the appropriate category of respirator for the substance from thelists contained in this section. The list of classes of respirators fromwhich EPA will make selections has been expanded to provide a more completerange of options and a list of physical states has been added at andSection;721.63(a)(6) to allow EPA to specify protective measures against respiratoryexposure from low-vapor pressure substances (e.g., acrylates) when theyare used in a manner likely to cause exposure, while allowing the measuresto be omitted when the substances are used in a manner not likely to causethe exposure. EPA encourages employers to evaluate their work areas and to implementindustrial hygiene programs that consider the use of engineering controlsto reduce or eliminate inhalation exposure. If an employer wishes to userespiratory protection controls which differ from those specified in aSNUR, the employer may request EPA approval for their use under andSection;721.30. EPA received comments suggesting that it adopt a performance-based approachto control respiratory exposure. EPA is considering development of performance-basedprovisions and will incorporate them into andSection; 721.63 when developed.However, until performance-based provisions are available and the ruleis amended, EPA will continue to specify respiratory protection equipment.iv. <T3>Low concentrations in mixtures.</T3> As noted above, andSection; 721.63(b)provides an exemption from use of controls on exposure when the substanceis present in the workplace in a mixture with concentration of the substanceless than or equal to a concentration specified in Subpart E of this Partfor a substance from dermal protection requirements, but excludes fromexemption mixtures which might concentrate above the exemption limit. Theconcentration specified will ordinarily be one percent of the chemicalsubstance (one tenth percent if the chemical substance is a carcinogen),which is consistent with the similar OSHA exemption, but other concentrationswill be specified when appropriate. The exemption would not apply if usingor processing a mixture containing the substance at a concentration belowthe exemption level is likely to concentrate the substance above the exemptionlevel. This exemption is not intended to cover a case where the substanceis present in the mixture in concentrations greater than the level setin Subpart E of this Part, even though the airborne concentration of themixture may be less than the level set in Subpart E of this Part. Thisexemption was not included in the proposed rule, but EPA has included itin response to comments to enable the provisions of andSection; 721.63 tobe consistent with the provisions of andSection; 721.72(e) and OSHA practice.v. <T3>Recipient activities inconsistent with a program for protection inthe workplace.</T3> Section 721.5(d), promulgated July 27, 1988 (53 FR28354), sets forth procedures that persons subject to a SNUR (suppliers)must follow if they become aware that a customer is engaging in a significantnew use, for example, the customer is not complying with workplace protectionrequirements. This section requires that the supplier stop distributionof the substance to that customer and notify EPA of the customer's failureto comply. EPA received comments that under some circumstances involvingworker protection measures this requirement could be unnecessarily harsh.In response, EPA has added andSection; 721.63(d), which allows the supplierto notify the customer in writing if its activities are inconsistent witha required worker protection program. If the supplier can then documentthat the customer has provided a written statement of assurance that appropriatemeasures to provide a worker protection program have been taken, the supplieris not required to stop supplying the customer. If a supplier later learnsthat the customer has failed to provide required worker protection, thesupplier must stop distributing to that customer and follow the requirementsof andSection; 721.5(d). 2. <T3>Section 721.72 Hazard communication program.</T3> i. <T3>Introduction.</T3> Section 721.72 establishes EPA's workplace hazardcommunication program. The section will be cited whenever EPA determinesthat it is necessary to inform workers of potential hazards and exposuresin the workplace and how they must act to protect themselves under bothroutine and emergency conditions. EPA has received comments that a programwill be easier to implement and more effective if it parallels the OSHAhazard communication standard to cover numerous existing chemicals whichare present in the workplace. EPA agrees, and the provisions of andSection;721.72 parallel those of OSHA's standard where possible, but there aredifferences between the two. The most significant differences are: (a)The OSHA standard requires an employer to make a hazard determination,while in the EPA standard the hazard determination is made by EPA; (b)the OSHA standard allows the employer to develop language for labels andfor the MSDS, while in andSection; 721.72 EPA provides certain language tobe included on the label and MSDS; (c) the OSHA standard has a trade secretsprovision while andSection; 721.72 does not; and (d) andSection; 721.72 requiresthat environmental hazards be listed on the container label and the MSDSwhile the OSHA standard does not. The primary reason for the first twodifferences is that, in evaluating new substances, EPA is most often relyingon a finding that a substance may present a risk, pending the developmentof additional data. OSHA's standard applies to substances for which moredefinitive data are available and which are known to present certain hazards.A separate trade secrets provision is not required, as section 14 of TSCAand EPA's rules issued to implement section 14 adequately address the issue.The fourth difference stems from EPA's broader mandate to protect the environment,as well as human health, from unreasonable risks. ii. <T3>Written hazard communication program.</T3> Section 721.72(a) sets forthrequirements for a written hazard communication program, which requiresthat each employer develops a written plan to ensure that employees whomay be exposed to the substance will be made aware of the hazards involved,and specifies employee information and training, such as control measuresto prevent employee exposure and release to the environment. The writtenprogram must be available to each employee, upon request. The proposedrule did not require a written hazard communication program. EPA includedthe written program in the final rule because EPA determined that a writtenprogram is necessary for a complete hazard communication program, and toparallel more closely the requirements of OSHA's standard, as suggestedby commenters. iii. <T3>Labeling.</T3> Section 721.72(b) sets forth labeling requirements forsubstances subject to andSection; 721.72. It addresses both labeling of substancesin the workplace and labeling for distribution in commerce. It requiresinformation on both types of labels to alert employees to the possiblehealth and environmental hazards of the substance and precautionary measuresto prevent exposure and/or release to the environment. The label must referthe user to the MSDS for details. Container labels used outside the workplacemust have the name and address of a responsible person who can be contactedfor additional information on the substance, including appropriate emergencyprocedures. iv. <T3>Material safety data sheets.</T3> Under andSection; 721.72(c) an employeris required to obtain or develop an MSDS. The MSDS format is not specifiedby EPA; however, EPA does specify information that must be listed, if known,including: Physical and chemical characteristics, health and environmentalhazards, signs and symptoms of exposure, medical conditions which may beaggravated by exposure, primary route(s) of exposure, and appropriate measuresto control worker exposure and/or environmental release. The final ruledoes not make any substantive changes to the proposal. An employer who distributes the substance must provide the MSDS at thetime of the initial shipment and with the first shipment after each MSDSupdate. If the substance is not currently being produced, imported, processed,or used in the workplace, the employer must add new information to theMSDS before the substance is reintroduced into the workplace. v. <T3>Employee information and training.</T3> The proposed employee informationand training requirements have been changed to place more emphasis on training.The training and information must be provided at the time of initial employeeassignment to a work area and whenever a substance subject to andSection;721.72 is introduced into the work area. The employee information and training program must identify and addresseach substance subject to these provisions in the employee's work area.EPA intends that the employee who is reasonably likely to be exposed bemade aware of and understand the health and environmental hazards of thesubstance and the control measures the employer is providing. This trainingrequires an explanation of the MSDS required for each substance. All acuteand chronic human health hazards known by the employer and identified inSubpart E must be listed, and the warning terms and phrases used to indicatethe hazard must be explained. The personal protective equipment, engineeringcontrols, and other measures used to control worker exposure and/or environmentalrelease must be listed and explained. The training must also include methodsand observations that may be used to detect the presence or release ofeach substance. Employees of contractors, and other workers not directlyemployed by the employer, must also receive the training and written materials,if the determination has been made that they are reasonably likely to beexposed to the substance. Employees must also be given information to help them identify all operationsin their work area where the substance is present, and how they may beexposed. Employees must be informed about the specific requirements ofthe labeling program, the requirements for the MSDS, and all aspects ofthe hazard communication program that are relevant to their work assignments.vi. <T3>Low concentrations in mixtures.</T3> Section 721.72(e) provides anexemption from the requirements of andSection; 721.72 if a substance is presentin the workplace only in a mixture containing a concentration less thanor equal to a concentration specified in Subpart E of this Part for a substance,but excludes from exemption mixtures which might concentrate above theexemption limit. The concentration specified will ordinarily be one percentof the chemical substance (one tenth percent if the chemical substanceis a carcinogen), which is consistent with the similar OSHA exemption,but other concentrations will be specified when appropriate. This low concentration exemption was not included in the proposed rule.EPA decided to include this provision in response to comments which statedthat without such an exemption the EPA program would be inconsistent withthe OSHA standard. vii. <T3>Existing hazard communication program.</T3> Section 721.72(f) clarifiesthe status of programs and procedures established under the OSHA standardand other rules. EPA intends that no unnecessary duplication of effortbe required when complying with andSection; 721.72. Commenters voiced theirconcerns about duplication of efforts because many already have a hazardcommunication program required under other rules. In all situations, ifan employer is complying with another rule and those efforts meet or exceedthe requirements of andSection; 721.72, no additional action is necessaryto comply with andSection; 721.72. viii. <T3>Human and environmental hazard and precautionary statements.</T3> Section721.72(g) provides the standard language that EPA will specify for labelsand MSDSs. EPA believes this standardization will provide consistency incontent and organization to the writing of SNURs. EPA's requirements donot exclude the addition of other material to the labels and MSDSs, butthey provide a minimum set of information which must be provided. 3. Section 721.80 <T3>Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.</T3> Section 721.80designates certain activities as significant new uses. Significant newuses described in this section include: Manufacture, processing, or usein non-enclosed processes; manufacture (except for export) of the substanceassociated with any use; use other than as an intermediate; use other thanas a site-limited intermediate; use as an intermediate, where the concentrationof the substance in products intended for distribution in commerce exceedsthe percentage specified by EPA; non-industrial use; commercial use; usein a consumer product; annual manufacture and importation volume greaterthan that specified by EPA; and manufacture, processing, or use in physicalforms specified by EPA. Some commenters on the proposed rule stated that the uses described inandSection; 721.80 are too broad and might require unnecessary notification.EPA has considered the comments, and has added additional uses where possible.For the most part, however, EPA has decided to promulgate the uses as proposed.EPA cannot predict and enumerate SNURs for every possible use variationthat might lead to significant exposure or release. Often it is more practicalto simply identify the category of use that is of concern. When EPA receivesa significant new use notification, it will evaluate the specific use thatis then proposed to determine whether it may present an unreasonable risk.4. <T3>Section 721.85 Disposal.</T3> Section 721.85 designates specific ongoingor allowed disposal methods. Any other method is designated as a significantnew use, requiring that manufacturers, importers, and processors submita significant new use notice 90 days before employing such a disposal method.Some commenters argued that the provisions of andSection; 721.85 duplicateEPA rules issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and are,therefore, unnecessary. EPA intends to include disposal provisions in SNURswhen it determines that disposal of the substance may not be adequatelyaddressed by existing disposal rules. EPA can consider requests to limitor revoke SNURs under the provisions of andSection; 721.85, if submittersbelieve they are in fact redundant. 5. <T3>Section 721.90 Release to water.</T3> Section 721.90 contains standardlanguage for designating significant new uses involving release to water.Section 721.90(a) addresses manufacture streams, andSection; 721.90(b) addressesprocessing streams, and andSection; 721.90(c) addresses use streams. Section721.90 (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c)(2) include a list of treatment technologies.EPA may specify one or more of these technologies for a substance if itdetermines that release without application of the specified treatmenttechnology would constitute a significant new use. Section 721.90 (a)(4),(b)(4), and (c)(4) require notification only if the predicted environmentalconcentrations exceed a specified level. In the proposed rule, reporting requirements for release to water wereaddressed in two sections. One covered process streams, the other, usestreams. The definition of process stream had included both processingand manufacture. EPA determined that it will not always be appropriateto require reporting for both processing and manufacture, so it has modifiedthe language of the rule to allow each to be specified separately as wellas to specify them together. To do so, EPA has added a definition for manufacturingstream and sharpened the definition of processing stream so that it doesnot include manufacturing, and has established separate sections for manufacturingand for processing (andSection; 721.90 paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2)), allowingthem to be specified separately. In cases where each should be a significantnew use, both will be specified. Section 721.91 provides a formula to be used in projecting environmentalconcentrations under andSection; 721.90 (a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4). A commenternoted that the formula established in andSection; 721.91 for calculatingestimated surface water concentrations is difficult to use. EPA reviewedthe formula but has been unable to devise a simpler calculation that wouldbe suitable for general use. EPA will consider alternative mechanisms forcalculation on a case-by-case basis, and may employ them if it determinesthat they are similar and will lead to a reliable projection of environmentalconcentration. B. <T3>Subpart C: Recordkeeping and Other Requirements</T3> Subpart C establishes recordkeeping requirements which apply to manufacturers,importers, and processors of SNUR substances. The specific records whichare required depend upon the activities which have been designated as significantnew uses. EPA will specify the appropriate recordkeeping requirements inSubpart E at the time it issues the SNUR for a particular substance. Suchrecords must be maintained for 5 years from the date of their creation.Several commenters voiced concerns that they will be required to keep separaterecords to document compliance with SNURs when records kept under otherregulatory programs should suffice to demonstrate compliance. In general,EPA has sought to frame recordkeeping requirements in flexible, performance-oriented terms. Rather than specify the particular types of records thatmust be kept, the rule lists the general types of information requiredto document compliance with SNUR requirements. Thus, manufacturers, importers,and processors will have discretion to determine which specific recordsmust be retained. The records required to be maintained under this sectionoften will be normal business records, and EPA intends that normal businessrecords will usually suffice. In a few cases, the generation of additionalrecords will be required. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer,importer, or processor to assess the adequacy of existing records, addto them if necessary, and maintain them in a form accessible to EPA forthe required length of time. EPA expects firms subject to SNUR requirements to exercise reasonable judgmentin determining the steps necessary to document compliance with SNUR requirements.Records that are sufficient to document SNUR compliance in one case maynot be sufficient in another. Table 1 illustrates EPA's approach to recordkeeping by providing examplesof the records that might document compliance with different SNUR requirements.These examples are intended merely to be illustrative. In many cases, theexamples listed in the following Table 1 would be sufficient to documentSNUR compliance; in other cases more or fewer records might be necessary.   <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1,xl75,xl75,r75   </C><T4>Table </T4>1_<T4>Administrative Examples of Records Complying With </T4>andSection;

721.160, 721.170, and 721.185expedited procedures for promulgation of, and for modifying or revoking,SNURs for new chemical substances. 1. <T3>SNUR requirements for new chemical substances regulated under section5(e) orders.</T3> Section 721.160 establishes expedited procedures forissuing SNURs for new substances that are subject to TSCA section 5(e)orders. The SNUR issued for each substance will be based on and be consistentwith the provisions included in the section 5(e) order governing use ofthe substance. EPA may also designate additional uses as significant newuses for such substances under the rulemaking procedures and criteria ofandSection; 721.170. i. <T3>Substances subject to section 5(e) orders issued before the effectivedate of this rule.</T3> EPA requested comment in the 1987 proposal on whetherandSection; 722.160 (now andSection; 721.160) should be applied to substancessubject to section 5(e) orders negotiated prior to the effective date ofthis rule. All commenters addressing this issue requested that EPA modifythe rule to do so. EPA has modified andSection; 721.160 so that it can beapplied to substances subject to section 5(e) orders issued prior to theeffective date of this rule. If the notice of commencement of manufacturefor the substance was received prior to the effective date of this rule,the direct final, interim final, or proposed SNUR will be issued within1 year of the effective date of this rule. If the notice of commencementof manufacture is received after the effective date of this rule, the directfinal, interim final, or proposed SNUR will be issued within 180 days ofreceipt of the notice. If EPA receives adverse or critical comments ona proposed SNUR, publication of the final rule may be delayed. ii. <T3>Non-issuance of SNURs for substances made subject to section 5(e) orders.</T3>EPA will generally issue SNURs for substances made subject to section 5(e)orders. However, in cases where EPA believes that there is little likelihoodthat there will be manufacturers or processors other than the PMN submitter,or for other reasons believes that a SNUR for the substance is inappropriate,EPA may decide not to issue a SNUR for a substance subject to a section5(e) order. In such cases EPA will issue a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> explaining its reasons for not issuing a SNUR.EPA expects that such cases will be rare. 2. <T3>SNUR requirements for new chemical substances not regulated under asection 5(e) order.</T3> Section 721.170 establishes expedited proceduresfor issuing SNURs to regulate activities not covered in a section 5(e)order. Additionally, it establishes criteria for choosing which substanceswill be regulated (``concern criteria''), and limits the uses for whichSNURs will be written, under the procedures of the section. i. <T3>Criteria other than concern criteria</T3>. EPA will only designatean activity as a significant new use under andSection; 721.170 if the activitywas not described in the PMN for the substance, and the activity also satisfiesa concern criterion established at andSection; 721.170(b). Such a use maybe made subject to a SNUR under this section whether or not a section 5(e)order is written for any other use of the substance described in the PMN.Procedures for issuing SNURs under andSection; 721.170 are in andSection; 721.170(c).EPA decided that certain designations in andSection; 721.80 are, by theirnature, not appropriate for expedited SNURs issued under the proceduredescribed in andSection; 721.170. Expedited procedures will be used to issueSNURs including these designations only for SNURs based on section 5(e)orders. These designations include, for example, designation of uses otherthan those described in the PMN described in andSection; 721.80(j), designationof cumulative manufacture or import in excess of specified quantities inthe absence of test data (andSection; 721.80(r)), and the failure to usepersonal protective equipment (described in andSection; 721.63). Although these activities are not included under the expedited proceduresof andSection; 721.170, EPA may at any time include them in a SNUR adoptedthrough separate rulemaking for a substance not subject to a section 5(e)order as long as it makes the findings specified in section 5(a)(2) ofTSCA. ii. <T3>Concern criteria: information to be used in choice of substances.</T3>Under andSection; 721.170, SNURs may be issued for new substances if theymeet the concern criteria established at andSection; 721.170(b). These aregenerally similar criteria to those used by EPA in determining if a section5(e) order should be developed. The criteria established at andSection; 721.170(b)generally call for development of a SNUR if the exposures likely to resultfrom uses not described in the PMN would have called for the developmentof a section 5(e) order if they had been described in a PMN. Several commenters expressed the view that, under the language of the proposedrule, substances would be subject to SNURs on the basis of inadequate evidence.Appropriateness of EPA use of evidence was discussed at length in the publicmeetings held prior to publication of the proposed rule. A descriptionof these discussions is in the public record for this rule. EPA believesthat its criteria for concern are appropriate. In general, EPA regulateson the basis of the weight of the evidence available to it from all sources.A commenter asked for restraint by EPA in use of structure activity relationshipanalysis (SAR) in assessing substances, and in framing SNUR restrictionsfor substances not subjected to a section 5(e) order. EPA makes its decisionsbased on the entire body of available evidence, and attempts to assignappropriate weight to each piece of evidence used. Often SAR is the bestevidence available for new, little-tested substances. When better evidenceis available, it will be given due consideration. Two commenters requested that EPA convene open scientific meetings priorto issuance of this final rule to identify the best scientific basis forapplying SAR. A commenter, noting that under the proposed rule notice andcomment rulemaking would be curtailed, asked that EPA convene workshopsand public meetings to receive comments on its use of SAR. In addition,the commenter asked that EPA annually reconvene the original Toxic SubstancesDialogue Group to assess how well the rule is working. EPA is always interested in receiving comments and responses on its proceduresand policies from regulated industry and the public. The change in thisfinal rule from immediately effective final rules to procedures that willallow for public comment on each individual SNUR as necessary should provideadequate opportunity for comment on SAR use, and on the ongoing use ofthis rule. Another commenter suggested that written SAR guidelines be released forpublic comment, and made a general request that scientific issues affectingPMN submitters receive the benefit of public comment. EPA does not intend to maintain a written SAR guidance document. EPA useof SAR to assess the possible risk posed by a substance is based on professionaljudgment on a case-by-case basis. A general discussion of EPA's approachto SAR use was presented in the public discussions prior to the proposal,and is available in the public record maintained for this rulemaking. EPA will hold meetings on its use of SAR and on other subjects as the needarises, but does not have plans for regular meetings at this time, nordoes it foresee using the Dialogue Group as a formal ongoing advisory group.3. <T3>Procedures for issuing expedited SNURs.</T3> The three procedures whichmay be used to issue SNURs under andSection;andSection; 721.160 and 721.170are: Direct final rulemaking, immediately effective interim final rulemaking,and notice and comment rulemaking. EPA will generally use direct finalrulemaking to issue new substance SNURs, unless it determines that useof immediately effective interim final rulemaking or notice and commentrulemaking is more appropriate. EPA will use immediately effective interimfinal rulemaking in cases where it believes there may be particularly highpotential hazard from uncontrolled use of the substance, or a particularlyhigh likelihood that someone would engage in a significant new use betweenthe time EPA announces its intention to issue a SNUR and the time the SNURwould take effect. When EPA determines that it is necessary to issue animmediately effective interim final SNUR, it will make the necessary findingsand explain its reasons in the rule. EPA will use notice and comment rulemaking to establish a SNUR when itbelieves there is a very high likelihood of public interest in commentingon the rule. i. <T3>Direct final rulemaking.</T3> Under the direct final rulemaking process,EPA will issue a document in the final rule section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> which contains the final SNUR. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> document will state that, unless written noticeis received by EPA within 30 days of publication that someone wishes tosubmit adverse or critical comments, the SNUR will be effective 60 daysfrom when the notice is published. If notice is received within 30 daysthat someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, EPA will withdrawthe direct final rule by publishing a notice in the final rule sectionof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and EPA will propose a rule in the proposedrule section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The proposed rule will establish a 30-day commentperiod. EPA then will consider any comments received and decide eitherto issue a final rule promulgating the SNUR or withdraw the proposal. In implementing the provisions of Subpart D, EPA intends as much as possibleto include more than one SNUR in a single <T4>Federal Register</T4> document to provide administrative efficienciesand save publication costs. With respect to direct final rulemaking procedures,when EPA publishes a number of SNURs in a single <T4>Federal Register</T4> document as direct final SNURs, the person notifyingEPA of intent to submit adverse or critical comments will be asked to indicateto which SNUR the comments will apply. EPA would then publish a noticein the final rule section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> withdrawing only that specific direct final SNURand publish a separate proposal for that specific SNUR. However, EPA wouldnot withdraw the direct final SNURs which are unaffected by the person'swish to submit adverse or critical comments. ii. <T3>Immediately effective interim final rules.</T3> When using the interimfinal rulemaking procedure, EPA will issue a notice of interim final rulemaking.The rule will be effective on the day of publication; however, EPA willaccept comments for 30 days following publication. The SNUR will ceaseto be in effect 180 days after publication unless in the intervening timeEPA has issued a final rule addressing any comments received during the30-day comment period. iii. <T3>Notice and comment rulemaking.</T3> When EPA uses notice and commentrulemaking, EPA will first issue a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> stating that a SNUR will be developed for thesubstance, explaining the basis for the SNUR, listing the uses it proposesto designate as significant new uses, and soliciting public comment. Afterconsideration of any comment on the proposed SNUR, EPA will issue a finalrule adding the substance to Subpart E and identifying the significantnew uses and recordkeeping requirements to which the substance is subject.The proposed version of this Subpart D called for EPA to promulgate immediatelyeffective final SNURs. Several commenters indicated that they did not believethat the proposed process would have given an adequate opportunity forpublic comment on the terms of SNURs before they went into effect. EPAhas modified the rule to provide for opportunity for public comment inrulemaking for all SNURs. Additionally, EPA has substantially changed itsinternal review process to reduce the time it takes to propose and promulgatemost SNURs under this subpart. This expedited internal review procedurewill provide for the speedy protection of the public and equal treatmentof PMN submitters and new users as contemplated in the April 29, 1987 proposal,but will allow public comments to be reviewed before the SNUR is promulgatedas a final rule. 4. <T3>Procedures to modify or revoke SNURs for new substances.</T3> Section721.185 establishes procedures to modify or revoke SNURs issued under thisSubpart D, and informs the public of criteria EPA will consider in determiningwhether to do so. EPA may at any time modify the activities designatedas significant new uses of a substance, or it may entirely revoke any specificsignificant new use notification requirement. EPA will consider modifyingor revoking a SNUR issued under the expedited procedures of Subpart D,if other considerations do not justify retaining the SNUR unchanged, whenit finds that one of the criteria at andSection; 721.185(a) is met. The procedures established under andSection; 721.185 to petition EPA to modifyor revoke SNURs are similar to those in TSCA section 21. Section 21 doesnot apply to SNURs. Decisions to revoke or limit SNUR requirements may be made either at EPA'sinitiative or in response to a request by interested persons. Section 721.185(c)provides that EPA will respond by certified letter to a request for modificationor revocation of a SNUR and, if EPA denies the request, will explain EPA'sreasons for concluding that the SNUR requirements should remain in effect.Rules revoking or limiting SNURs under andSection; 721.185 will be issuedunder notice and comment rulemaking procedures. Section 721.185 will helpensure that well-founded concerns about the validity of SNUR requirementsare acted on expeditiously, and that the public understands the procedurefor modifying or limiting those requirements. D. <T3>Removal of Proposed Information Requirements Under TSCA Sections 8(a)and (d) </T3>In the proposed rule, EPA included procedures for automatically requiringreporting for certain new substances under TSCA section 8(a) at 40 CFRPart 704 and section 8(d) at 40 CFR Part 716. A commenter suggested thatEPA carefully consider the conditions under which section 8(a) reportingon a substance that has been the subject of a SNUR is appropriate. EPAhas considered the need to issue these information collection rules inan expedited manner, and has decided not to do so. When section 8(a) and(d) rules are appropriate for new substances, EPA will issue them on acase-by-case basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis </ITAG>EPA has evaluated the potential costs and benefits of establishing significantnew use requirements for manufacture, import, and processing of new chemicalsubstances under the procedures established in this rule. EPA's completeanalysis is available in the public record for this rule (OPTS-50553B).The analysis is summarized in the preamble to the proposed rule. The costsand benefits of this final rule do not vary significantly from those describedin the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. <T3>Rulemaking Record</T3> </ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control numberOPTS-50553B). The record includes basic information considered by EPA indeveloping this rule. The record includes the following:1. The proposed rules. 2. Comments received on the proposals leading to this rule. 3. Summaries of public meetings held to discuss the proposed rules. 4. The economic analysis of the rule. 5. Comment response document. 6. This final rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This record is available to the public in the TSCA Public Docket Officefrom 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.The TSCA Public Docket Office is located in Rm.

Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and, therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this rule is not a ``major rule'' because it will not have an effecton the economy of $100 million or more, and it will not have a significanteffect on competition, costs, or prices. EPA has determined this rule tobe ``significant,'' because it will represent a significant change in theNew Chemical Follow-up Program under TSCA. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA has determinedthat this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small businesses. EPA cannot determine whether parties affected by thisrule are likely to be small businesses. However, EPA believes that thenumber of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantialeven if all the companies affected by this rule are small companies. EPAdoes not expect to regulate a large number of substances annually underthis rule.  C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approvedby OMB under the provisions of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act,</T3> 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and have been assigned OMB control number 2070-0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 12.2 hours per response for Subpart B, and to average 25.3 hoursper response for Subpart C, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460 and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503 marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 721  </ITAG>Chemicals, Confidential business information, Environmental protection,Hazardous substances, Health and safety, Imports, Recordkeeping and reportingrequirements, Significant new uses.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">F.

A unit operation is a functionalstep in a manufacturing, processing, or use operation where substancesundergo chemical changes and/or changes in location, temperature, pressure,physical state, or similar characteristics. Include steps in which thesubstance is formulated into mixtures, suspensions, solutions, etc. (2) Indicate on each diagram the entry point of all feedstocks (e.g., reactants,solvents, and catalysts) used in the operation. Identify each feedstockand specify its approximate weight regardless of whether the process iscontinuous or batch. (3) Identify all release points from which the substance or wastes containingthe substance will be released into air, land, or water. Indicate theserelease points on the diagram. Do not include accidental releases or fugitiveemissions. (4) For releases identified in the diagram that are destined for water,estimate the amount of substance that will be released before the substanceenters control technology. The kilograms of substance released may be estimatedbased on: (i) The mass balance of the operation, i.e., totaling inputs and outputs,including wastes for each part of the process such that outputs equal inputs.The amount released to water may be the difference between the amount ofthe substance in the starting material (or formed in a reaction) minusthe amount of waste material removed from each part of the process andnot released to water and the amount of the substance in the final product.(ii) Physical properties such as water solubility where a known volumeof water being discharged is assumed to contain the substance at concentrationsequal to its solubility in water. This approach is particularly usefulwhere the waste stream results from separation of organic/water phasesor filtration of the substance from an aqueous stream to be discharged.(iii) Measurements of flow rates of the process/use stream and known concentrationsof the substance in the stream. (5) After releases of a substance to water are estimated for each operationon a site, total the releases of the substance to water from all operationsat that site. The value (number of kilograms) specified in the numeratorof the equation should reflect total kilograms of substance released towater per day from all operations at a single site. (6) Use the highest expected daily release of the substance for each site.(b) <T3>Receiving stream flow.</T3> (1) The receiving stream flow shall beexpressed in million liters per day (MLD). The flow rate data to be usedmust be for the point of release on the water body that first receivesrelease of the substance whether by direct discharge from a site, or byindirect discharge through a Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTW) foreach site. The flow rate reported shall be the lowest 7-day average streamflow with a recurrence interval of 10 years (7-Q- 10). If the 7-Q-10 flowrate is not available for the actual point of release, the stream flowrate should be used from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stationthat is nearest the point of release that is expected to have a flow rateless than or equal to the receiving stream flow at the point of release.(2) Receiving stream flow data may be available from the National PollutantDischarge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the site or the POTW releasingthe substance to surface water, from the NPDES permit-writing authorityfor the site or the POTW, or from USGS publications, such as the water-datareport series. (3) If receiving stream flow data are not available for a stream, eitherthe value of 10 MLD or the daily flow of wastewater from the site or thePOTW releasing the substance must be used as an assumed minimum streamflow. Similarly, if stream flow data are not available because the locationof the point of release of the substance to surface water is a lake, estuary,bay, or ocean, then the flow rate to be used must be the daily flow ofwastewater from the site or the POTW releasing the substance to surfacewater. Wastewater flow data may be available from the NPDES permit or NPDESauthority for the site or the POTW releasing the substance to water. 4.
