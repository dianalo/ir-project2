She showed that age need not be a factorwhen you have the expertise and the energy. I knew DorothyFuldheim, and she made us all proud.''   Ms. Fuldheim died at 3:07 a.m. at Mt. Sinai Medical Center,according to hospital spokeswoman Mary Beth Schotzinger. She hadbeen living in a Cleveland nursing home until she was admitted tothe hospital Oct. 19.   Ms. Fuldheim began her television career in 1947, when she was54 years old, as the news anchorwoman for WEWS-TV in Cleveland. Shehad nearly 37 unbroken years with the station.   Ms. Fuldheim's manner of presentation was sometimes poetic andusually feisty.   ``Dorothy was truly a great lady,'' said James H. Knight,general manager of WEWS and a vice president of Scripps HowardBroadcasting. ``Her energy and compassion were an inspiration toall of us who worked with her at WEWS and really to everyone whoknew her.   ``Her determination and success paved the way for women in thebroadcasting industry.

A few hours later, she suffered a strokethat ended her career.   Ms. Fuldheim had said Albert Einstein was her most memorableinterview.   ``I was so awed,'' she said. ``It confirmed for me my beliefthat man has just begun to develop a brain.''   Perhaps her most poignant news commentary came May 4, 1970, afew hours after four students were killed and nine wounded as OhioNational Guardsmen opened fire during an anti-war protest at KentState University. In her tearful comments, she said the incidentamounted to murder.   Ms. Fuldheim was born Dorothy Violet Snell in Passaic, N.J., in1893, but grew up in Milwaukee. She graduated from Milwaukee NormalCollege, now part of the University of Wisconsin, in 1912.   She taught elementary school, then joined the Milwaukee LittleTheater.
