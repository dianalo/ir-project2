Edwards, an associate professor at Bowling GreenState University, speaking to the Heritage Foundation lastspring:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Since Rudolph Flesch published his book &quot;Why Johnny Can'tRead&quot; in 1955, we have heard a lot about Johnny. . . . Notonly can Johnny not read, he also can't write. Johnny can'tspell, can't do arithmetic, can't tell you when the Civil Warwas fought, can't distinguish the words of Stalin fromChurchill, and can't identify Central America, or his ownstate for that matter, on a map. There's one other thingJohnny can't do. Johnny can't fail.   No matter how poorly Johnny has performed in school, ourbenevolent, paternalistic educational system -- the perfectanalogue to our welfare system -- has by and large found away to promote Johnny to the next grade, found a way to keephis self-esteem intact, lest he be disgruntled, discouraged,or guilt-ridden.   Johnny's deficiencies as a student can always be explainedaway by reference to personal circumstances: poor schoollunches, budget cuts, biased testing procedures, a brokenhome, racial or gender discrimination. (Well, in Johnny'scase, probably not gender discrimination.) And besides, hisunderdeveloped skills or languishing motivation can always beremediated or accommodated next year, on the next rung, bythe next teacher, in the next school, perhaps by divertinghim to some subject matter or vocational interest more to hisliking or aptitude -- a scheme that may well postponerecognition of his failure indefinitely, possibly all the wayup to and including graduate school.   For Johnny himself to fail -- as an individual and notmerely as a faceless, disadvantaged personification of somelarger subclass -- someone would have to be responsible. Someparent, some teacher, some principal, some school board,maybe even Johnny himself would have to become accountablefor that failure, would have to explain it to somebody; andperformance standards, objective criteria, would have to beevoked to catalog the extent of the failure and the place tobegin to remediate Johnny.</TEXT></DOC>
