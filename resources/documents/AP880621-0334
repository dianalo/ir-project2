He said it would bepremature to consider reopening previous contract competitionsbecause of allegations made to date, and declined comment whenasked if any military personnel on active duty were facinginquiries.   Asked if any defense contractors were facing a suspension oftheir right to bid on new contracts because of the allegations,Howard replied: ``There are no actions of that type at this point.''   The investigation began with a tip from a former Navy departmentemployee to NIS, said a Navy source who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The ex-Navy employee, working for a defense contractor, wasapproached by a consultant offering confidential information forsale. The employee agreed to have his conversations recorded withthe consultant. The consultant later agreed to cooperate with thegovernment and recorded his conversations with others, said thesources.   On Capitol Hill, former Pentagon investigator Robert L. Segalsaid the Justice Department had ``substantive evidence that therewas massive fraud'' in military weapons purchases three years agobut failed to pursue the case.   Segal, who worked one year as the Pentagon's liaison with theprocurement fraud unit in the Justice Department, described himselfas frustrated due to ``a terrible lack of competence'' at the fraudunit which was ``not prepared to handle'' an involved case.   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, had contended Monday that theJustice Department could have conducted the current fraud andbribery probe three years ago, but Meese defended his department,saying ``that at no time has this department had to be dragged intoany indictment where the evidence is there.''   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said that while he did not condone corruption in defenseprocurement, the current investigation is ``not that big a deal''compared with the magnitude of payments and other activities duringWorld War II.   ``Today's eyeballs would roll'' at the actions 40 years ago whenfighter planes were developed to counter those of the Japanese andGermans, he said in a telephone news conference with Idahoreporters.   The Defense Department made public financial disclosure formsprovided by Paisley _ who worked for the Pentagon from 1981 toMarch 1987 _ and his long-term associate, Gaines, thenow-reassigned deputy assistant secretary of the Navy foracquisition management.   Paisley, whose office was bugged and whose telephone was tapped,listed assets of between $417,000 and $1.2 million in May 1987, twomonths after he left government. His liabilities _ mortgages onthree rental properties _ were between $80,000 and $200,000.   The forms also show that in April 1983, Paisley disqualifiedhimself from matters dealing with BDM Corp., anengineering-technical services firm in McLean, Va., where his wifeworked. Previously, Mrs. Paisley was employed by Computer SciencesCorp., in Falls Church, Va., and Boeing Computer Services inSeattle, Wash.   In 1986, Paisley also disqualified himself from matterspertaining to the Boeing Co., where he had worked for 28 years,because of questions raised by the Justice Department regarding hisprior employment by the aerospace company and his severancepayments from it. Paisley also was getting retirement pensionpayments of about $29,000 a year from Boeing.   There has been no indication that either BDM or Boeing have beensearched or subpoenaed by federal investigators.   Telephone calls about Paisley and BDM were referred to BDM'sdirector of public affairs, Stephanie Bolick, who was out of theoffice and not immediately available for comment.   Gaines, who had worked for Paisley at Boeing and at thePentagon, listed assets of between more than $240,000 and $795,000in a form filed in August 1987. Gaines also disqualified himselffrom dealings with Boeing.   In St. Louis, the FBI filed a list of items collected lastTuesday in a search of the office of Thomas Gunn, marketing vicepresident of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Among the items seized were:two 1988 desk top calendars, a stenographic notebook with ``phonenumbers and information'' a memo from Gunn ``re Paisley AssociatesInc. dated 4-15-87,'' and a folder marked ATF (Advanced TacticalFighter). Paisley Associates was headed by Melvyn Paisley and theadvanced tactical fighter was one of the contracts about whichinformation allegedly was passed without proper authorization.</TEXT></DOC>
