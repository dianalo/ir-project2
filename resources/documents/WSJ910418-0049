Most were up about 25% in the first quarter,on top of a similar gain in the last quarter of 1990.   A few forces have been at the truckers' backs. Investorsanticipate an economic recovery, and they're willing to payfor it in advance in the stock market. Elaine Garzarelli, arespected market pundit with Shearson Lehman Brothers, gavetrucking issues a boost with an enthusiastic recommendationin December. And more recently, investors started toanticipate the train workers' strike that started yesterdaymorning.</LP><TEXT>   But after a long, fast run, the stocks are due for a pitstop, some market professionals say. &quot;The stocks seem toreflect a full recovery already,&quot; says Anthony B. Hatch,analyst for PaineWebber. He had recommended Yellow FreightSystem earlier this year, but now carries a neutral rating onall the truckers except for Consolidated Freightways, whichhe calls a &quot;sell.&quot;   David Dreman, managing director of Dreman Value Managementin New York, says trucking stocks are &quot;pretty far down thelist&quot; of things he might buy. &quot;The truckers have had alackluster record right through the decade,&quot; he says. &quot;Theirbest years were in the 1960s and 1970s. I don't think they'reall that attractive, when you compare them to otherindustries for a cyclical turnaround.&quot;   As plays on a recovering economy, Mr. Dreman prefersaluminum, auto, chemical, and paper stocks. For people whowant a transportation stock, how about a nice railroad? &quot;Whenyou buy the railroads, you get {natural} resources too.&quot;   Wall Street generally likes Roadway Services best of thetrucking bunch. By most measures, it is the most profitableof the group. It has $150 million in cash and no debt. And itposted rising earnings for each of the past three years.   According to a recent tally by Zacks Investment Research,six Wall Street analysts are recommending Roadway, comparedwith five for Yellow Freight, three for Carolina Freight, andtwo for Consolidated Freightways. Consolidated, locked in astruggle to turn around its ailing Emery air freight unit,has been a favorite of short sellers, who bet on stocks todecline.   David A. Katz of Matrix Asset Advisors in New York says hetends to shy away from trucking stocks because their earningsare extremely hard to predict. When they do well, he says,they do very well, but when they do badly, &quot;they doterribly.&quot;   Ned Davis, head of a Nokomis, Fla., research firm bearinghis name, says he favors the trucking group, mostly becausethe stocks have momentum. He is puzzled that falling oilprices didn't do more to help railroads and airlines, andisn't any longer recommending those sectors.   Mr. Davis says trucking stocks may seem to have had a bigmove, but really have only retraced part of their loss sinceearly 1989. His index of nine trucking issues hit 309 at thattime, then fell all the way to 140 in October, beforebouncing back to a recent 215.   Mr. Davis wouldn't base any buying decisions on the railstrike. &quot;It's never a good idea to move on strike news,&quot; hesays, because the effects are temporary and anticipated bythe market. Of the current rail strike he says, &quot;Congress canend it at any moment.&quot;   For her part, Ms. Garzarelli still likes the truckers, andhas 5% of her $500 million mutual fund (the Sector AnalysisPortfolio) in Roadway, Yellow and Consolidated. She believesthey can outperform the broad market by 25%.   But they are no longer one of Ms. Garzarelli's veryfavorite groups. &quot;They've had a gigantic gain,&quot; she says. Forpeople who want to play a rebounding economy, she recommendsauto stocks, leisure-time stocks, and truck or truck-partsmakers.   What if the economy rebounds anemically, or not at allthis year? Ms. Garzarelli isn't worried. &quot;I'm 100% sure wewill have a recovery,&quot; she says, citing gains in consumerconfidence and housing starts.   But others are far less sure. &quot;If there's any delay inthis recovery, any change {in truckers' earnings} is morelikely to be negative than positive,&quot; warns PaineWebber's Mr.Hatch. In that case, trucking stocks could give investors avery uncomfortable ride.   ---   IPO TRACKERS' TIFF: New Issues, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,newsletter, bills itself as &quot;America's only publication oninitial public stock offerings.&quot; That is &quot;a lot of nonsense,&quot;snaps Charles Allmon, editor of the rival New Issue Digest.&quot;We've been publishing for 21 years.&quot; Asked to back up hisclaim of uniqueness, Norman G. Fosback, editor of New Issues,says that New Issue Digest &quot;is irregularly published, and notpublished at all during some poor market periods.&quot; Mr. Allmonsays his letter comes out like clockwork &quot;on a quarterlybasis,&quot; plus an occasional special issue.</TEXT></DOC>
