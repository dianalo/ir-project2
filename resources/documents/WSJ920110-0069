The proposal by Arthur Dunkel, director-general of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would vastly expandthe reach of the GATT and would liberalize trade inagricultural goods. U.S. businesses have widely criticizedthe plan as potentially harmful to U.S. agriculture and ahost of services industries. But the trade officials saidthat a pending round of negotiations, due to start on Monday,would produce benefits not now apparent from the Dunkelproposal.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The big economic gains aren't there to be evaluated,&quot;said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. Nevertheless, shecalled the proposal a &quot;major milestone&quot; in concluding thetortuous talks, which have run five and a half years.   Senior U.S. trade officials said the U.S. would push totoughen proposals by Mr. Dunkel for rules governingcopyrights, patents, and &quot;unfair trade&quot; lawsuits. But themost immediate obstacle to reaching agreement is resistancein the European Community to the agricultural provisions.   The EC, which is meeting to consider the tradenegotiations this weekend, already has said it would rejectMr. Dunkel's agricultural proposals because they wouldrequire the EC to slash subsidies too deeply. The EC isexpected to try to persuade the U.S. and others participatingin the 108-nation talks to soften the proposal by exemptingdirect payments to farmers from the proposed schedule ofcuts. While other indirect forms of subsidies would bereduced, U.S. farm interests complain that exempting directpayments would create a huge loophole.   The attempts by the U.S., the EC and others to modify theDunkel plan pomises to make Monday's GATT meeting largelyceremonial, with negotiators simply presenting theircountry's positions. When Mr. Dunkel unveiled his plan aboutthree weeks ago, he had hoped that the coming GATT meetingwould yield a climactic yes-or-no vote. It is now clear thatweeks of negotiations lie ahead.   At a hearing by the House Agricultural Committee, DeputyTrade Representative Jules Katz called the Dunkel proposal &quot;amajor step foward&quot; in resolving the agricultural dispute withthe EC. Richard Crowder, undersecretary of agriculture,echoed that assessment, saying Mr. Dunkel's draft &quot;provides aframework to bring the negotiations to a successfulconclusion.&quot;   But the administration officials were followed by asuccession of farm organizations complaining that protectionfor U.S. cotton, peanuts, sugar, rice and dairy productswould be substantially diminished. Under the Dunkel plan,imports of those products into the U.S. would double in 1993and nearly double again six years later.   Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.) submitted a statement to thecommittee, saying he opposed the Dunkel proposal. Theproposal would &quot;severely damage&quot; family dairy farmers, hesaid, &quot;who are looking for some help from the federalgovernment, not another kick.&quot; Mr. Obey's opposition presageswhat would surely be a bitter battle in Congress to approve aGATT agreement if negotiators finally wrangle a deal in thepending talks in Geneva.   Separately, the U.S. is reopening talks with China todayin an attempt to settle a potentially disruptive dispute overBeijing's alleged disregard for U.S. patents, copyrights andindustrial secrets. If an agreement isn't reached by Jan. 16,the U.S. intends to retaliate with punitive tariffs onChinese imports. Beijing has threatened to strike back with&quot;counter-retaliatory&quot; tariffs on a number of U.S. products,including aircraft, steel and corn.   A senior U.S. official said there's slightly better than a&quot;fifty-fifty chance&quot; that a breakthrough could be achieved.When the two sides last met before Christmas, China withdrewa number of previously-offered concessions, prompting theU.S. to complain that the talks are &quot;retrogressing.&quot; Wu Yi,the head of the Chinese negotiating team, was quoted earlieras saying that this weekend's talks in Washington couldsucceed if the U.S. &quot;shows just a little bit of sincerity.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE RICE MILLERS' ASSOCIATION said the rice industryhasn't taken a position on the so-called Dunkel plan forconcluding world trade talks. In Friday's edition, it wasincorrectly stated that rice organizations testified againstthe Dunkel plan at a House hearing Thursday. The proposal byArthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, would liberalize trade and cut agriculturesubsidies world-wide. Rice was also incorrectly included on alist of crops that might lose substantial U.S. protectionunder the plan.   (WSJ Jan. 13, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
