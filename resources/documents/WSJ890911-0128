The New Jersey vote Thursday night marked the end of a monthlong strike against the Philadelphia-based company. The company had settled more than a week before with the Communications Workers of America, which represents some 43,000 Bell Atlantic employees, but most Communications Workers members in New Jersey had refused to cross IBEW picket lines.    Both unions are continuing their strike against New York-based Nynex Corp., saying the company has refused to significantly alter its plan to shift some health care costs to employees. </TEXT></DOC>
