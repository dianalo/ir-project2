In the accord, Japan pledged to step up efforts toincrease U.S. chip sales in its market by promotingcooperative business arrangements between U.S. semiconductorproducers and Japanese computer and electronics-goodsmanufacturers. Japan also agreed to encourage its chip buyersto establish &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot; purchasing rules and tosupply U.S. vendors with timely market information.</LP><TEXT>   In return, the U.S. said it will dismantle an elaboratesystem by which it constantly monitors price and cost data ofJapanese chip makers to determine whether they are violatingU.S. anti-dumping laws. In the future, the U.S. simply willrequire the Japanese importers to collect price and costinformation and to submit the data to the Commerce Departmentif the U.S. chip-making industry complains of dumping, orselling in the U.S. at prices below the cost of production.The new arrangement will ease the threat that the U.S. willimpose anti-dumping duties on low-priced imported Japanesechips.   Deputy Trade Representative Linn Williams, who initialedthe accord, said the 20% target isn't a &quot;guarantee&quot; of thatshare of the Japanese market for U.S. chip vendors. Rather,he described it as an &quot;expectation&quot; of what the U.S.companies can attain if they enter into more long-termbusiness relationships with Japanese buyers or are invited todo more chip-designing for Japanese products.   Mr. Williams described the new accord as a carefulbalancing of conflicting interests not only between the U.S.and Japan, but also among different U.S. policy makers andbetween the U.S. semiconductor and computer industries.   His effort drew praise from both U.S. industries. WilfredCorrigan, chief executive officer of LSI Logic Corp. andchairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association, calledJapan's acknowledgment of the 20% goal a &quot;historicmilestone.&quot; And John Young, chief executive ofHewlett-Packard Co., applauded the reduced &quot;level ofgovernment intervention&quot; required by the new agreement.   But some congressional critics charged the administrationwith being too soft on Japan. House Majority Leader RichardGephardt criticized the agreement for lacking &quot;specificcommitments&quot; by Japan to widen its chip market to foreignsellers. The Missouri Democrat chided the administration fortrading away &quot;identifiable goals&quot; for &quot;empty processes.&quot;   The accord reflects President Bush's desire for more freetrade in the semiconductor industry. John Taylor, a member ofthe president's Council of Economic Advisers, said it does abetter job of protecting the interests of the U.S. computerindustry than the previous, 1986 semiconductor accord did.The U.S. computer industry seeks high-quality chips at lowprices from both U.S. and foreign sources.   For their part, Japanese officials hailed the new pact forshedding what they described as the &quot;managed-trade&quot; flavor ofthe 1986 agreement. The earlier pact also spoke, in a secretside agreement, of a 20% U.S. share of the Japanese market.The U.S. viewed the figure as legally binding, but Japandidn't. The new agreement is &quot;more transparent, and there areno secret documents,&quot; said Hiroshi Hirabayashi, the economicsminister of the Japanese Embassy here.   As a further concession to Japan, the U.S. has agreed toterminate punitive duties on imports of Japanese laptopcomputers, power tools and other products. The importscurrently total about $165 million a year. These tradesanctions, which were invoked under the 1986 accord, will bescrapped when the new one takes effect on Aug. 1.   In one tortuous compromise, the new agreement incorporatestwo different methods for calculating the U.S. market sharein Japan. Mr. Williams said the U.S. will rely mainly on asystem that counts only the sales of foreign chips in theopen market in Japan. However, at Japan's insistence, theaccord also allows a broader measurement that includesso-called &quot;captive&quot; sales of U.S. companies to their Japanesesubsidiaries and those by Japanese companies under foreignbrand names.   The U.S. method likely would show the American share ofthe Japanese market currently totals slightly more than 13%,while the Japanese-preferred approach would show the U.S.share may be as high as 16% or 17%, Japanese officials said.The accord provides for periodic reviews to reconcilediffering readings of the results.   Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade official whohelped craft the initial accord in 1986, called the new pacta &quot;step backward.&quot; But most U.S. industry leaders, at leastpublicly, disagree. They say they are happy with the newaccord, which they think will give them extra momentum in theJapanese market.   Alan Wolff, the U.S. semiconductor industry's tradecounsel, praised the new agreement for bringing the 20%market-share goal &quot;out into the open.&quot;   U.S. and Japanese executives say they don't expect the newagreement to produce any sudden breakthroughs, but ratherthat Tokyo's efforts to open its market to American chipvendors will expand from the computer industry into newsectors like consumer and automotive electronics. Japanesediplomats say that Hitachi Ltd., Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp.are among large electronics conglomerates going out of theirway to find U.S. suppliers.   The Electronic Industries Association, which representsmany of the large U.S. producers, predicted that theagreement will eventually help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.   The agreement drew a guarded reaction from Congress.&quot;Unfortunately, the commitment to improve market access issomewhat ambiguous,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D. Mont.),chairman of the Senate international trade subcommittee. Heobjected to the decision to lift trade sanctions againstJapan now.</TEXT></DOC>
