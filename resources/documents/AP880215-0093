(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republicans George Bush and Bob Dole headinto New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday in a virtual dead heatwhile Michael Dukakis maintains his lead among Democrats, new pollssuggest.   A Gallup survey released today shows Dole at 36 percent toBush's 28 percent. Given the poll's 5 percent margin of error, theyare essentially tied.   Rep. Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson had 12 percent each, formerDelaware Gov. Pete du Pont 7 percent, and 6 percent were undecided.Gallup polled 589 likely Republican voters Friday and Saturday.   According to a poll for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV, Dole leadsBush 32 percent to 31 percent. On Feb. 9, one day after Dole'svictory in the Iowa caucuses, Bush led Dole 32 percent to 23percent. The other GOP candidates were in single digits, accordingto the survey of 500 likely Republican voters. The margin of errorwas 4 percent.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis held comfortable leads in theGallup and Herald-WBZ surveys.   The Gallup poll showed the Massachusetts governor at 39 percent,followed by Richard Gephardt at 18 percent and Paul Simon at 16percent. The other Democrats trailed far behind among the 424likely Democratic voters surveyed. The margin of error was 4percent.   The Herald-WBZ survey put Dukakis at 38 percent. Next cameGephardt at 19 percent and Simon at 13 percent among the 500 likelyvoters polled.   A CBS News poll and a ABC News-Washington Post survey, bothreleased Sunday, also suggested that Dole, who is coming off aconvincing win in last week's Iowa caucuses, is now even with Bush.   Among the Democrats, Dukakis remained the runaway leader withSimon, of Illinois, and Gephardt, of Missouri, fighting for second.The CBS poll gave Gephardt a slightly higher level of support.   The CBS survey was conducted Feb. 12-13, while the ABC-Post pollwas based on interviews Feb. 11-13.   Among Republicans, the CBS survey ran down the race this way:Dole, 31 percent; Bush, 30 percent; Kemp, 11 percent; Robertson, 10percent; Dupont, 10 percent; and undecided, 8 percent.   Given the 4-percentage-point sampling error margin for thesurvey, Dole and Bush are essentially tied. In a previous CBSsurvey on Feb. 10-11, Dole had 32 percent and Bush had 29 percent.   In the ABC-Post interviews among Republicans, here was thebreakdown: Dole, 31 percent; Bush, 28 percent; Kemp, 13 percent;Robertson, 11 percent; du Pont, 11 percent. Former secretary ofstate Alexander Haig, who dropped out Friday, drew 1 percent and 4percent were undecided.   The ABC survey was based on interviews with 374 likely GOPvoters. The CBS survey was based on interviews with 594 likely GOPvoters.   Among Democrats, the ABC poll laid out the race in this fashion:Dukakis, 40 percent; Simon, 17 percent; Gephardt, 16 percent; JesseJackson, 7 percent; Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, 7 percent;Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, 6 percent; Former Colorado Sen.Gary Hart, 3 percent; undecided or others, 5 percent.   The CBS survey gave Gephardt a bit of an edge and Simon asmaller number: Dukakis, 42 percent; Gephardt, 18 percent; Simon,12 percent; Jackson, 4 percent; Gore, 4 percent; Hart, 4 percent;Babbitt, 3 percent; undecided, 13 percent.   The CBS survey was based on interviews with 483 likelyDemocratic voters. The ABC survey was based on interviews with 383likely GOP voters.   As with all random sample surveys, these polls are subject tovariations because of chance fluctuations in the sample.   For polls based on about 400 interviews _ such as both ABC polls_ that sampling error margin is 6 percentage points either way.That is, if all likely New Hampshire voters with telephones wereinterviewed, the results of these polls would vary by 6 percentagepoints simply because of chance variations in the sample.   For polls based on aout 500 interviews _ like the CBS Democraticsurvey _ the sampling error margin is 5 percentage points. Forpolls based on about 600 interviews _ like the CBS Republicansurvey _ the sampling error margin is 4 percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
