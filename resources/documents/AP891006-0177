Gorbachev advised East Germans to ``bepatient, don't panic'' as he paid a 40th anniversary visit Fridayto a country torn by dissent and rejected by tens of thousands ofcitizens.   But in an apparent hint that East Germany's aging leaders shouldsoften their hard line, he urged them to work with ``all forces insociety'' to solve the country's problems.   Political suppression and authoritarianism have led to a growingnumber of opposition groups. One delivered an appeal for help fromGorbachev to the Soviet Embassy on Friday.   Police fought protesters in Dresden and Magdeburg, and communistauthorities barred Western tourists from East Berlin. DissatisfiedEast Germans continued fleeting to freedom in the West.   Unconfirmed reports by the Hamburg newspaper Die Welt and WestGermany's ZDF television said East Germany was building barbed wirefences on its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia, communistallies refugees have used to reach the West.   Gorbachev expressed ``complete confidence'' in the leadership'sability to deal wtth discontent, declaring: ``We know our Germanfriends well and their ability to think through problems, to learnfrom life and to make corresponding political changes if they arenecessary.''   Some in the crowd called out: ``Gorby, help us! Gorby, keep itup!'' to the Soviet leader, whose reforms have been rejected bytheir government.   ``Be patient, don't panic and don't be sad. We are very closepartners and we will solve our problems and struggles together,''Gorbachev told about 1,000 East Germans at a monument for victimsof fascism.   ``We're staying here!'' several onlookers shouted.   Speaking Friday night to the party hierarchy and hundreds ofinvited guests, Gorbachev said: ``We have heard demands such as theU.S.S.R. should take down the Berlin Wall and then people couldbelieve in (the Soviet Union's) peaceful aims. Our Western partnersshould understand that questions regarding (East Germany) are notsolved in Moscow but in Berlin. '   In appealing to the leadership, Gorbachev said: ``There is nodoubt that the Socialist Unity Party has the intellectualpotential, rich experience and political authority to cooperatewith all forces in society to answer the questions placed ontoday's agenda.''   The public welcome for Gorbachev appeared subdued in comparisonwith enthusiastic receptions in the United States, West Germany andelsewhere. Most people allowed on the downtown motorcade route werechosen by authorities.   Erich Honecker, the wily, 77-year-old who has run the countryfor nearly two decades, used his own speech to reaffirm the hardline and condemn international efforts toward the ``destabilizationof socialism.''   For the first time in recent memory, East German television didnot carry a live broadcast on the Soviet leader's arrival.   Asked if he thought the situation in East Germany was dangerous,he said: ``I don't think so. Held up against our problems, there isno comparison. Nothing surprises us anymore.''   In a clear reference to opponents of his reforms, Gorbachevsaid: ``Those who grasp the impulse of society and base theirpolicy on that have no reason to be afraid.''   East Berlin was decked with huge red banners, flags and posterspraising accomplishments of the communist nation founded Oct. 7,1949.   Honecker was reported gravely ill after gallbladder surgery inAugust. Asked about his health Friday, he replied with a smile:``People pronounced dead keep on living.''   Communist authorities closed at least three of the nine crossingpoints from West Berlin to East Berlin to Western tourists onFriday. Western allies strongly protested the closings, saying itviolated the right to free travel.   ``I wanted to see the celebration and all the Communist hype.I'm extremely disappointed,'' Joel Gardner of Washington, D.C.,said at Checkpoint Charlie.   Church sources, speaking to The Associated Press on thecondition of anonymity, said heavy police forces with clubs, teargas and water cannon patrolled through the country's major citiesfollowing the clashes.   The sources said about 200 people had been arrested and at leastfour seriously injured in the clashes late Thursday.   To squelch any further protests, the Communist leadershipstepped up security nationwide, while communist paramilitaryworkers' groups in Leipzig vowed to take up guns if needed to crushopposition movements.   West Germany's ZDF television and church sources reportedclashes beteen protesters and police in Dresden and Magdeburg.   In Magdeburg, north of Leipzig, police clashed with about 600people who joined in a silent march through the city after a churchprayer late Thursday.   There was street fighting in Dresden two times earlier this weekas mostly young citizens hoped to board trains carrying other EastGermans to a new life in the West.   More than 47,000 East Germans have turned their backs to theircommunist homeland since mid-September in a mass exodus unseensince the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961.   A train carrying 633 East Germans arrived in West Germany onFriday from Poland. More than 360 others took advantage ofHungary's open-border policy and arrived from there.</TEXT></DOC>
