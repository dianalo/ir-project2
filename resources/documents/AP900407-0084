The diplomat, who was not identified, was ousted for ``an abuseof his privileges of residence in the United States,'' a departmentspokeswoman, Anita Stockman, said Saturday. She said the diplomatleft on Thursday.   ``Given the nature of the diplomat's actions, it would beinappropriate for the government of Iraq to take any retaliatoryaction,'' the spokeswoman said.   She said the department could not provide no more specificinformation except to confirm that the expulsion was linked to aninvestigation in California.   ``We cannot comment on that case since it is currently underinvestigation,'' she said.   But a U.S. official, asking not to be named, said the diplomathelped plan the alleged plot.   A federal grand jury in Sacramento on Friday indicted a formeremployee of the mission for allegedly participating in an Iraqiplot to kill two foes of the Iraqi government in the United States.   Andri Khoshaba, 47, of the central California city of Modesto,was indicted on two counts of interstate travel to further thealleged murder-for-hire plot. Khoshaba is a former employee ofIraq's mission to the United Nations.   U.S. Attorney David Levi said Khoshaba, an Iraqi-American, waspromised $50,000 for his role in the plot, which the FBI disruptedby detaining him briefly.   A spokesman for Iraq's U.N. mission in New York said Friday hehad no knowledge of Khoshaba's recent activities.   Levi refused to identify the targets of the plot, but said theywere not part of any country's mission to the United Nations andthat they were not U.S. officials.   ``They were people opposing the Iraqi regime in this country,''he said. ``One of the targets was living in the United States.''   The Modesto Bee reported that the targets of the assassinationplot were Sargon Dadesho, a leader of the Assyrian community inCalifornia's Central Valley, and an unidentified Kurdish leader,whose photograph Khoshaba was carrying when he was detained by theFBI. The Bee got its information from Dadesho and unnamed sourcesclose to the investigation.   A federal warrant has been issued for Khoshaba's arrest, Levisaid. He remains at large.   A spokesman for the Iraqis' U.N. mission who would not give hisname said Khoshaba ``was working with the former permanentrepresentative at his residence as a janitor.''   ``His job was terminated one year ago and from that time wedon't know anything about him,'' the spokesman said.   Levi said Khoshaba worked as a driver.   The U.S. attorney said Khoshaba traveled to New York City twicethis year to meet with an Iraqi government agent. He returned toModesto after each trip, Levi said.</TEXT></DOC>
