The newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat, quoted Palmer as saying U.S. leadershad ``systematically'' refused to engage in normal talks with NewZealand.   ``This is rather strange treatment toward a nation which in theAmerican view is, after all, friendly and democratic,'' Palmer said.   Palmer said political relations between the United States and NewZealand had cooled since a decision in 1984 by then-Prime MinisterDavid Lange's government to only allow maritime visits by vesselsthat verifiably carry no nuclear arms.   Palmer, who was Lange's right-hand man in the previous Cabinet,was elected prime minister a month ago after Lange resigned.</TEXT></DOC>
