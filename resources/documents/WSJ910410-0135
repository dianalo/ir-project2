The lion's share of recent insider transactions have beensales, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commissionshow, reflecting insiders' desire to cash in on the stockmarket's recent sharp rally. But a handful of insiders havebeen buyers. And, at least on paper, they've generally made aprofit.</LP><TEXT>   Consider the chairman and the president of defense giantGeneral Dynamics Inc., both of whom made sizable purchases inlate February, according to SEC filings. William Anders, thefirm's chairman, bought 10,000 shares for $252,500,increasing his total General Dynamics stake by about 30%.James Mellor, the president, bought 5,000 shares for$125,026, a 21% increase in his holdings, SEC filings show.   The two executives paid prices of $25 to $25.25 a sharefor the stock, the SEC filings show. It closed yesterday inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading at $31.125. Bothmen declined to comment.   SEC filings show that insider buying has been particularlyaggressive in the oil and gas industry, at utilities and atbanks. But these buyers are bucking a huge trend.   That fact shows up clearly when insider transactions areviewed in terms of purchases or sales by groups of three ormore insiders at the same company. Roughly four-fifths ofsuch &quot;cluster&quot; transactions in February or early March weresales, SEC filings show. In contrast, last October, 98% ofthese clusters of insiders were buying stock.   One of the banks that has experienced strong insiderbuying is Key Centurion Bancshares Inc. of Charleston, W. Va.The largest recent purchase was made by Fred Haddad, adirector, who spent $581,944 in several purchases in lateFebruary through March, as shown on the Insider TradingSpotlight. The purchases increased his total holdings in thecompany by 6%, SEC filings show.   Mr. Haddad bought the stock at prices ranging from $11 to$11.65 a share, the filings show. In over-the-counter tradingyesterday, Key Centurion closed at $13, a paper profit forMr. Haddad, in less than a month, of about $76,000.   Larry Stark, head of investor relations for Key Centurion,said Mr. Haddad &quot;made the purchases because he thought it wasa good investment.&quot; While bank stocks have been hammeredlately, the last quarter has been a good one for theindustry, and Key Centurion has benefited, he said.   In another banking transaction, Roland W. Hancock, adirector of People's First Corp. in Paducah, Ky., more thandoubled his holdings in the company with a purchase on March21, SEC filings show. Mr. Hancock bought 6,752 shares at$17.50 a share, or a total of $118,160, according to thefilings.   The stock, in over-the-counter trading, finished at $18yesterday. Mr. Hancock couldn't be reached for comment.   William M. Griffin, a director of Texas Utilities Co.,paid $109,890 for 3,000 shares of the Dallas-based electriccompany, SEC filings show. The purchase, on Feb. 28, morethan doubled his existing holdings, according to the filings.He paid $36.625 a share; the stock closed yesterday at$37.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Mr.Griffin, a Hartford, Conn., investor, couldn't be reached forcomment.   Not all the bullish insiders have seen share prices risesince their purchase, however. Dycom Industries Inc. directorClement McGillicuddy bought 50,000 shares in severalpurchases in March, SEC filings show. He paid $750,000, or anaverage of $15 a share, for stock in the West Palm Beach,Fla., utility. That was also the stock's closing levelyesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Mr. McGillicuddy declined to comment. A spokesman for thecompany said Mr. McGillicuddy joined Dycom's board ofdirectors just last month.   What would it take to bring more insiders back into themarket as buyers?   &quot;We expect to see a significant correction in the marketbefore we see insider buying pick up because insiders arevalue players, and they see stocks as overpriced,&quot; saidRobert Gabele, head of Invest/Net, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,firm that tracks SEC filings and compiled the statistics oncluster buying and selling.   Right now, &quot;the message that we're getting from insidersis that they feel they can buy shares cheaper down the road,&quot;said Mr. Gabele.</TEXT></DOC>
