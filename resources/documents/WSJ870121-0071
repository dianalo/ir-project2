The unit, which makes glass wool and mineral wool, said current employees who smoke may be fired if they can't kick the habit. In addition, the unit said it will no longer hire people who smoke -- on or off the job. The main reason: Recent scientific studies suggest that glass and mineral wool may cause lung disease, and that smokers who work with glass and mineral wool are even more vulnerable.    USG Acoustical said in a news release that the studies were &quot;inconclusive&quot; and that its plants are safe; nonetheless, it adopted the policy to &quot;minimize any potential health hazards.&quot; It said it will pay for treatment or programs to help employees stop smoking, and provide respirators and other protective work clothes. To monitor health -- and to smoke out backsliders -- the unit will give its workers periodic lung function tests.    The unit currently employs about 1,500 people.    Company officials couldn't be reached to comment beyond the statement. The parent company makes building materials. </TEXT></DOC>
