And in the economics ruling the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, that means downward pressureon international oil prices.   Early last year, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United ArabEmirates and Qatar -- which among them boast more than 40% ofthe world's known oil reserves -- were about the only OPECnations that didn't feel much pressure to increase revenues.How suddenly the world has changed.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The situation has tilted,&quot; says Joseph Stanislaw,managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.&quot;All 13 countries {of OPEC} now are living with a strongrevenue imperative.&quot;                                                                                                          The tilt within OPEC -- combined with the eagerness ofIraq, Iran and Kuwait to increase their revenues to rebuildtheir war-ravaged economies -- may not cause crude prices tocrash. But it does mean that the pressure to raise revenuesby selling more crude oil is likely to remain strong,blunting expectations of significant rises in crude oilprices.                                                                                                          Already, war-torn Kuwait is expected to produce in thefourth quarter 200,000 barrels of oil a day, of which it willrefine more than half. Embargo-stricken Iraq, meanwhile, saysit could get production up to two million barrels a day bythe middle of next year, of which it would probably export1.5 million barrels a day.   Even the Russians, if they arrange for Western technicalhelp, are likely to add to the supply-side pressure in theinternational market for crude oil.   The sparsely populated Gulf states -- the nations that nowfind themselves under greater pressure to find revenues --account for almost half of OPEC's output. The bulk of that,of course, comes from Saudi Arabia, the group's largest oilexporter and the keeper of the largest pool of readilyexportable oil reserves.                                                                                                          The war over Kuwait has been expensive for the Saudis.Their contributions to allies and other largess may have costthem as much as $70 billion in one-time outlays, according todiplomats there. On top of that comes as much as $10 billionin clean-up costs associated with the huge oil spill into theGulf, plus big bills for new military hardware.                                                                                                          &quot;Saudi Arabia has very serious revenue pressures,&quot; saysVahan Zanoyan of Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-basedconsulting concern, especially because it has &quot;depleted itsfinancial assets over the past nine years.&quot; Moreover, theSaudis &quot;are the only ones who are expected to cut production&quot;within OPEC, Mr. Zanoyan said late last week after returningfrom OPEC's recent meeting.   The Saudis need some $45 billion to $50 billion to covertheir needs; even before the Gulf war, they were experiencingshortfalls of about $10 billion. With few tax revenues, theyhave been resorting to running down their financial reserves.   Saudi Arabia doesn't publish official numbers for itsgovernment deficit, but the consensus is that it's risingsteeply. This year, it &quot;might be $25 billion to $30 billion,doubling over what it might have been&quot; without the war, Mr.Stanislaw says. Even without war costs, Saudi Arabia'sdeficit is likely to have risen between 25% and 50% from anestimated $10 billion in 1989.   This is a far cry from 10 years ago, when Saudi Arabia'strade figures showed a current account surplus of $41billion, and the Gulf altogether showed a surplus of morethan $60 billion.                                                                                                          Already, the thirst for funds is pushing the oil-richArabs to borrow money. Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait recentlynegotiated huge loans with syndicates of international banks.The Saudis, who don't like to be seen breaking Islamicstrictures about paying interest, quietly arranged a $4.5billion loan through J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Then last week, SaudiArabian Oil Co. was reported to be negotiating for a loan ofabout $1 billion. The Kuwaitis already have called atMorgan's Wall Street offices to arrange billions of dollarsin borrowings.                                                                                                          If Morgan's lending terms prove unappetizing or the sumsinsufficient, the Saudis already have some chits at Citicorp,the largest U.S. banking company. Earlier this year,Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, one of the rulingfamily's many princes, paid about $600 million for a chunk ofconvertible preferred stock, that could give him ownership ofclose to 10% of Citicorp's common.   The Federal Reserve is certainly wary of the possibilitythat the Saudi prince might want to turn Citicorp into aready coffer for his country. In a Feb. 21 letter to hislawyers, the Fed expressly forbade the new investor fromattempting to &quot;influence the loan and credit decisions orpolicies of Citicorp&quot; without the Fed's prior approval.   Buying into international banks, of course, hasn't workedout well for some in the Gulf. Shaik Zayed bin Sultanal-Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UnitedArab Emirates, is struggling to come to terms with theseizure of his $20 billion bank, Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational.   That has already cost him well over a billion dollars.More huge BCCI-related bills are likely to land in his lapeven if he succeeds in persuading Western regulators to allowhim to restructure the bank. And restructuring would forcehim to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in newcapital.</TEXT></DOC>
