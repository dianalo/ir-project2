Much to the dismay of Mr. West, a member of the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, such punishment is a long wayfrom reality. The laws governing the commodities marketsdon't bar insider trading.</LP><TEXT>   Frustrated by that situation, Mr. West is taking on hisown agency to press for change. But it's an uphill battle.Some in Congress are trying to give the futures regulator newmuscle to go after insider trading, but three of the fourmembers of the CFTC don't want that power. Indeed, CFTCsentiment against such a law is so strong that the agency islobbying against it.   That leaves Mr. West out on a limb as the solecommissioner who believes the lack of legal firepower opensthe futures markets to abuse. &quot;This is a huge loophole,&quot; saysthe commissioner, one of four on the body. &quot;It should bestopped. It's a terrible practice.&quot;   The issue was spotlighted by a surge in coffee-futurestrading last week on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange justbefore Brazil halted exports of the product. While there isno specific evidence of insider activity, rumors are rife inthe markets that some traders had advance word of theBrazilian move -- and traded on that news.   Mr. West doesn't expect any enforcement case to come outof the Brazilian incident. But he has little trouble offeringscenarios of distasteful insider activity. &quot;Consider this,&quot;he says. &quot;An employee of XYZ company knows that the next daythere would be a large wheat sale to China, in which XYZ washeavily involved. The employee knows this because heparticipated in a key XYZ meeting about the sale. Theemployee takes a futures position in wheat on that day and ofcourse profits by the subsequent price move when the nextday's announcement of the sale becomes public.   &quot;It seems to me that this employee has stolen thecompany's property, namely proprietary information, much likethe teller who embezzles bank funds,&quot; Mr. West fumes.   Other CFTC officials concede that on its face suchactivity looks bad. But they counter there is no proof thattype of impropriety happens. &quot;Is that type of action anyproblem at all?&quot; asks fellow commissioner Kalo Hineman. &quot;Ifail to see that any case has been made for it.&quot;   What's more, the deep-pocketed futures industry, whichcarries more weight with Congress than the CFTC does, isjoining with the agency to fight any such change,jeopardizing passage of the House measure and keeping it outof the Senate version.   Commissioner Hineman argues that if insider trading isgoing on, legal remedies exist. Companies have policies thatbar most employees from taking insider positions, he notes.So if improper trading occurred, legal action could be takenfor misappropriating company property, though such a steprarely is made. Moreover, Mr. Hineman frets that CFTC orcongressional action would hamper the markets' centralpurpose -- to provide producers, growers and users ofagricultural products the opportunity to hedge their risk.That view is repeatedly argued by large commodity companies.   Commissioner William Albrecht, meanwhile, contends thatthe world isn't exactly clamoring for new laws. &quot;It's notsomething that rises up as one of the great issues of thefutures markets,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody's complaining. There isn'tevidence of a significant level of abuse out there.&quot;   But Mr. West scoffs at such views. &quot;I want to prohibit, bystatutory change, those activities which attack the notion ofa futures market which is honest and fair for allparticipants,&quot; he has told his fellow commissioners.</TEXT></DOC>
