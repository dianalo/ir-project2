No pickup</HEAD><DATELINE>EDE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The last two of three Van Gogh paintingsstolen from a museum last year were recovered Thursday, Dutchtelevision and other news reports said.   Vincent van Gogh's 1887 work ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and an earlyversion of his famous ``Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885 wererecovered, slightly damaged, the national news agency reported.   Recovery of the paintings, whose total value has been estimatedat $72 million to $90 million, followed the arrests in recent weeksof four people suspected in the Dec. 12, 1988, theft from theKroeller-Mueller Museum, 13 miles from Ede.   In April, the thieves returned the third stolen painting, theDutch impressionist's 1884 work ``The Loom,'' in an attempt toenforce a ransom demand of $2.2 million for the others.   According to the agency report, the paintings were delivered topolice Thursday afternoon by the lawyer for one suspect. The lawyerwas not identified and police refused to confirm the report.   The news agency said the four arrests followed another ransomdemand made early last month, but did not give a figure or saywhether any money had been paid.   None of the four suspects, aged 22-37, has been identified, inkeeping with Dutch police practice. Two have been released pendingcharges, the agency report said.   The thieves smashed a 6-foot-wide hole in a window of theKroeller-Mueller Museum, in a remote location in the middle of alarge national park near the village of Otterlo.   Police, stymied by an almost total lack of clues, put the case onthe back burner. In March, after several months of silence, thethieves contacted museum director R.W.D. Oxenaar to demand theransom.   On April 6, Oxenaar received a telephone call at his home from aman who said ``The Loom,'' valued at $18 million to $22 million,could be found in the trunk of a car parked nearby.   The painting, wrapped in a blanket, was found with only a fewscratches so minute that officials first thought it had not beendamaged at all.   A few days later, a caller told Oxenaar to have a driver standingby with the money, but the ransom exchange fell through.   Art experts had speculated the paintings would be held for ramsombecause they are so well-known that they would be virtuallyunsellable on the open market.   The final and most famous version of ``Potato Eaters,'' alsodated 1885, is on display at the Vincent van Gogh National Museum inAmsterdam. The museum has the largest collection of works by theimpressionist, who lived from 1853 to 1890.</TEXT></DOC>
