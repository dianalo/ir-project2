(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The police chief of this city added hisvoice to nationwide calls for a ban on assault weapons after a manusing an AK-47 rifle shot 20 former co-workers at a printing plantbefore killing himself.   ``You don't need these kinds of weapons unless you're a policeofficer or a criminal,'' Police Chief Richard Dotson said at a newsconference where he held up the AK-47 and one of the two MAC-11semiautomatic machine pistols used in Thursday's rampage.   The gunman, Joseph T. Wesbecker, committed suicide after killingseven and wounding 13 workers at the Standard Gravure Corp. where heworked until a year ago.   ``What do you need these for _ except for killing people?''Dotson said.   Police said Wesbecker also was armed with a .38-caliber handgun,a 9mm Sig-Sauer pistol, and a bayonet that apparently fit the AK-47.He carried several thousand rounds of ammunition.   ``You've got to wonder whether these assault rifles ... should bebanned from the ability to purchase them within the confines of theUnited States,'' said Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson, who was givena tour through the carnage by police.   ``I saw people in excruciating pain, with bodies strewnthroughout the three floors. The scene was like a Vietnam or WorldWar II.''   A lobbyist for the National Rifle Association acknowledged themassacre would put the organization in a more guarded position as itattempts to deflect legislation to ban assault-style weapons.   ``Any time there's a tragedy of this degree it's going to requireus to be responsive to increased concerns, but the bottom line issueis the same: Would a gun law have stopped this kind of thing?'' saidJim Baker, the lobbyist. ``We don't think so.''   The Bush administration imposed an import ban on assault-typerifles in July, but the ban didn't affect guns already owned byAmericans or similar weapons produced by U.S. companies.   California in May became the first state to enact restrictions onthe possession or sale of the guns. The law was prompted by theshooting of 35 people at a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunmanwith an AK-47.   ``How many more Louisville and Stockton massacres must happenbefore our lawmakers have the courage to stand up to the gunlobby?'' said Sarah Brady, chairwoman of the national HandgunControl lobbying group.   ``My heart goes out to the families of the victims of thishorrible tragedy in Louisville,'' she said in a news release. ``It'stoo late for them, but we can prevent further massacres involvingassault weapons if Congress will approve pending legislation.''   Mrs. Brady's husband, former White House press secretary JamesBrady, was seriously injured in the 1981 assassination attempt onPresident Reagan.   Ray Yeager, owner of Ray's Gun Shop in Louisville, said lawsregulating the sale of assault weapons such as the Soviet-designedAK-47 are ``just about the same as it is in any state. It's the sameas buying a shotgun or any other type of rifle.''   He said a customer wanting to purchase an AK-47 would have topresent a valid driver's license and fill out a federal form.   The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a measure that wouldban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault-style weapons, fivealready covered by the administration's import ban and four othersproduced domestically.   While providing up to 10 years additional prison time for thoseconvicted of crimes involving firearms, the law would go off thebooks in three years under a ``sunset'' provision.</TEXT></DOC>
