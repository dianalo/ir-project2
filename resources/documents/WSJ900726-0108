Newhouse,chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc., stood in front ofthe staff of Woman magazine and delivered news it had fearedbut expected: The magazine was closing.   Meanwhile, across town, the U.S. unit of French publisherHachette S.A. announced it was giving up its attempt toauction off Woman's Day, the mass-circulation magazine it putup for sale in May. With advertising pages and circulationfalling off sharply, the bids from interested buyersapparently came in well below the $200 million the Frenchwere seeking.</LP><TEXT>   Almost every consumer magazine is fighting its way througha persistent advertising slump. But the folding of Woman andthe failure to sell Woman's Day indicate that the perenniallystrong category of women's magazines is showing troubling,long-term weakness. In the case of both magazines, thepublishers said even though there were interested buyers,bankers were skittish about financing magazine acquisitionsin the uncertain climate.   &quot;This is a tough business environment and gettingtougher,&quot; says Patricia Donnelly, vice president at Young andamp;Rubicam, who specializes in packaged goods clients, majoradvertisers in women's magazines. &quot;I would expect morewomen's magazines to be faced with folding.&quot;   Both Woman and Woman's Day, like most magazines in thecategory, have been hit by large declines in cigaretteadvertising dollars and plummeting single-copy sales atsupermarket checkout stands and convenience stores. Tobaccocompanies are traditionally heavy advertisers in women'smagazines, and women's magazines are the largest sellers atcheckouts.   But publishers learned the bad news last week that tobaccocompany ad spending in consumer magazines has fallen 27% from1989. And, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations figures,total magazine circulation at newsstands and checkouts fell14% between 1982 and 1989. Agency executives expectsingle-copy sales will fall further in 1990.   The trouble in women's magazines is stretching acrossseveral categories. Conde Nast's Vogue lost 10% of its adpages in the first half of 1990 because of tumult in theretail and fashion industries, and ad pages at New York TimesCo.'s McCall's fell 13% as packaged goods companies slashedtheir budgets. A couple of magazines continue to showstrength, including Hearst Corp.'s Good Housekeeping, wheread pages rose 7% in the first half, and its Redbook, up 2%.Some start-ups, such as News Corp.'s Mirabella and Hearst'sVictoria, are growing.   For Conde Nast, the failure of Woman is a majordisappointment. Mr. Newhouse bought the magazine in late 1988for about $13 million to build strength at checkout counters,where Woman sold 500,000 copies. But Woman was also anattempt to reach beyond Conde Nast's usual upscale, affluentaudience to an older, more middle-of-the-road readership. Theaverage Woman reader was 35 years old, with a householdincome of about $27,000.   In the first half, Woman's ad pages dropped 16%. Accordingto the most current circulation figures, newsstand andcheckout-counter sales dropped 14% in the 1989 second halffrom a year earlier, with total circulation dropping 3.2% to502,397. Staff members said the magazine had a loss of $8million in 1989 and was expected to lose a similar amountthis year.   Conde Nast said it would try to hire as many Woman staffmembers as possible. But Editor Pat Miller and PublisherRebecca Darwin haven't been offered new positions and will beleaving the company.   The 53-year-old Woman's Day, meanwhile, remainsprofitable, though its earnings are expected to declinesharply this year. According to a publishing executive whosays he looked at Woman's Day's prospectus, Hachetteestimated the magazine's operating profit would fall to $15.9million in 1990 from $25 million in 1989. Hachette says thatthe $15.9 million figure is &quot;not correct&quot; and that earningswill be higher but declines to be specific.   Hachette acquired Woman's Day as part of its 1988 purchaseof Peter Diamandis's Diamandis Communications Inc., now theU.S. magazine subsidiary of Hachette. Mr. Diamandis, who wasreluctant to put the magazine up for sale in the first place,says that the bids &quot;did not reflect the true worth&quot; ofWoman's Day. Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette,says that the company will now turn to &quot;investing itsconsiderable resources&quot; in the magazine.   &quot;We were able to find bidders, but the bidders were unableto get bankers to go along with the price they wanted topay,&quot; Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications Inc.,says. &quot;Bankers don't want to lend the money the way they dida year or two ago. They are more cautious.&quot;   Mr. Guerin says Hachette wanted to sell Woman's Day toreduce the debt from its $712 million purchase of Diamandis.But he adds: &quot;Hachette doesn't have a debt problem. We areable to meet all our obligations.&quot; Despite speculation thatMemories, another Diamandis magazine, would be put up forsale, Mr. Guerin says no other magazines will be offered forsale at this time.   ---              Ad Slump Hits Women's Magazines                                                                                                                     Ad pages for first half of 1990                                                                                                                                        1990         % CHANGE   TITLE                         PAGES        FROM 1989                                                                                                          Woman's Day                    750           -15%   Woman                          148           -16   McCall's                       488           -13   Working Woman                  473           -12   Soap Opera Digest              207           -12   Vogue                        1,355           -10   Glamour                        917           - 9   Cosmopolitan                 1,097           - 8   Good Housekeeping              831           + 7                                                                                                          Source: Publishers Information Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
