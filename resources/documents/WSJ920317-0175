Nobetter explanation has appeared to account for how U.S.surveillance managed first to find the North Korean ship DaeHung Ho, and then lose track of it just before the shipdelivered its cargo of medium-range Scud missiles to theIranian port of Bandar Abbas. The U.S. fulminated againstNorth Korea, a rogue communist state that over many yearsunder Great Leader Kim Il Sung has sinned frequently againstinternational peace and security. But in the end it didnothing.   This was not an especially good signal to send,considering that Great Leader Kim is now, according tosources such as CIA Director Robert Gates, close to producinghis own nuclear weapons. Surely any North Korean armstraffic, once noticed, ought to command the unblinkingattention and clear opposition of any country patrolling theseas in the name of peace.</LP><TEXT>   Israeli intelligence had disclosed that the Dae Hung Ho aswell as a second North Korean ship, the Dae Hung Dan, were enroute to either Syria or Iran and were believed to becarrying new Scuds. These are missiles enhanced with moreprecise, longer-range delivery systems than those launched byIraq against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War.   It's hard to accept the explanation of Defense Departmentspokesman Pete Williams that the U.S. located the first shipin the Indian Ocean, but then lost it again: &quot;We werecertainly looking for it. I don't know why we never foundit.&quot; This is America's high-tech Navy?   Our suspicion is that Washington, trying right now tochivvy Pyongyang toward a nuclear-disarmament deal, simplydidn't want to make waves by stopping that ship. Our ownsources suggest that, as do Mr. Williams's further comments.&quot;We were aware of the ship, curious about where it wasgoing,&quot; he said, &quot;but there was a limit to what we could havedone.&quot;   It is unlikely the U.S. would have acted even if theseships had sent up flares en route and passed out T-shirts.There is a U.N. arms embargo against Iraq, but not againstSyria or Iran, however much mischief-making they might havein mind. So there was a good excuse for inaction.   But what about any prospects that North Korea will complywith the accords of the U.N.'s International Atomic EnergyAgency? That process is inching forward, sending out SOSsignals as it goes. Pyongyang signed a deal in January withthe IAEA that would in theory permit inspections of NorthKorean nuclear facilities, but set no timetable. Pyongyangsigned another deal yesterday with Seoul to set up aNorth-South Korean commission to monitor a ban on nucleararms on the Korean peninsula. But among the unresolveddetails: The North wants access to all suspected nuclearsites in the South, but offers access to only one complex inthe North.   Pyongyang's credibility has bombed often. In recent yearsit has reneged on billions of dollars' worth of foreign debtand lied about its terrorist attacks on the South. Now it isdenying that it just delivered missiles to Iran. The U.S.,which has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, wants tohurry the nuclear accords along because observers such as CIAchief Gates have warned that North Korea is rushing tostockpile weapons-grade plutonium that it can hide beforeinspection crews arrive.   The question for U.S. policy makers is what they intend todo should North Korea sign all the nuclear accords and then-- in the tightly controlled recesses of Kim's Stalinistkingdom -- violate them.   Not until the collapse of Mr. Kim's regime is there anychance that North Korea can be a friendly and remotelytrustworthy nation. Until that day, the best way to deterNorth Korea from savaging anyone else is to send the clearmessage that if North Korea makes the slightest move towardviolating the free world's interests, North Korea will gethurt. There are political risks in stopping Scud shipments.But appeasement is riskier still.   The second North Korean ship is still out there somewhere.If President Bush believes the U.S. can locate and stop suchships only by way of U.N. resolutions, then it's time tofloat such a resolution sending North Korea the message thatarms traffic is an impermissible way of shoring up either itsugly alliances or its emaciated economy. There might beobjections from such quarters as China, given Beijing'sembarrassing position as another covert arms purveyor to theMiddle East. But if America's goal is to promote world peace,then American policy makers have got to find ways to draw theline long before nations such as Iraq or North Korea pushtheir luck to the point where they can be stopped only byall-out war.</TEXT></DOC>
