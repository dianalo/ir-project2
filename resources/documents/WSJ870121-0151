As the premier lists his party's achievements for the region -- 3,000 new jobs at a BMW plant, the construction of an Autobahn stretch -- adults hoist quart-sized beer steins and teen-agers bite into 10-inch pretzels. Below the dais, guards hold back older people straining near the premier's feet.    Mr. Strauss is the anarchic force keeping things unpredictable in West Germany's flat political landscape. Voters are almost certain to return to power the coalition led by Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. The main question is whether the CDU and its southern sister -- the Christian Social Union, which Mr. Strauss heads -- will garner enough votes to make it possible for Mr. Strauss to claim the job of foreign minister from its longtime inhabitant, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, leader of the Free Democratic Party. Such a Strauss victory is by no means certain, but worth watching. If past behavior is any guide, the elliptical Bavarian might then pursue the contradictory policy of vociferous support for the Western Alliance, new intimacy with East Bloc countries and protection of West German interests.    &quot;Strauss is Strauss,&quot; trumpets the Bayern Kurier, the CSU's party paper. &quot;And Strauss is a political might, absolutely and independently of whatever political office he holds at the moment.&quot;    Although it's been nearly 20 years since he held a cabinet position at the federal level, Mr. Strauss pursues a full-fledged extra-governmental foreign policy. He jets around the world, calling now on Syria, now on Albania. He was among the first Western leaders to meet with Mao Tse-tung in the 1970s and he personally arranged a $394 million loan to East Germany. In the current campaign, Mr. Strauss, as CSU chairman, should be doing his best to help the senior coalition partner. But his mere red-faced presence is enough to make Chancellor Kohl look colorless. At the Christian Democrats' convention last fall, delegates chatted and smoked cigarettes as their candidate spoke. When guest Strauss arrived, party members and reporters fairly stampeded from the coffee stand as they raced back to catch his opening words.    They've had reason to listen. When West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg laid out plans for a net reduction of $10.86 billion in personal and corporate taxes after the election, Mr. Strauss's Christian Social Union signaled its objection to undoing West Germany's substantial subsidies and tax breaks. When the Kohl government presented a privatization program for Germany's state-controlled companies in 1984, Mr. Strauss blocked its crowning piece, the partial privatization of Lufthansa, through his influence as a member of the national airline's supervisory board.    Foreign Minister Genscher and his Free Democrats have been a particular Strauss target. The Bavarian lion's vendetta against the current junior coalition partner goes back 25 years, when a threat by the FDP to leave the government if Mr. Strauss remained forced Mr. Strauss out of his position as defense minister. Lately Mr. Strauss has been attacking the FDP's civil-rights-minded opposition to a proposed set of strict internal-security laws designed to stop West Germany's new wave of terrorism.    &quot;In the Weimar Republic,&quot; Mr. Strauss thunders at Straubing, &quot;we had fewer assassinations than we have now. . . .&quot;    On foreign policy, Mr. Strauss is pro-American. But his positions sway, depending in many cases on what world leaders have lately fed his formidable ego. Last fall he dropped in on Saudi Arabia's King Fahd for a talk about arms sales to the Saudis, though West German law prohibits arms sales to areas of tension, in which the current government places the Saudi peninsula. The Strauss specialty is the East Bloc. Several years ago he upstaged Bonn when he arranged the loan to East Germany. Sometimes piloting a plane himself, he pays visits to East Bloc states -- including Albania and even hunts in Romania.    Domestically, Mr. Strauss is also something of a wild card. Although he pays lip service to free-market ideals,he's been a major obstacle to the Kohl government's hoped for privatization of West Germany's numerous government-controlled enterprises. He and other CSU leaders influence much of Bavarian and West German industry through board memberships linking state and industry. Mr. Strauss is on the board of a leading state bank. His finance minister chairs the board of the Munich aerospace and technology concern Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm. Mr. Strauss is also chairman of the government-controlled Bayernwerk AG, which controls a controversial new atomic plant in Wackersdorf.    Mr. Strauss has been a driving force behind Europe's heavily subsidized consortium of aerospace concerns, Airbus Industrie, which he serves as chairman. Last Thursday Lufthansa announced an order worth up to $2.5 billion for 15 of Airbus Industrie's proposed A-340 long-distance jetliners. The decision was a big help to Airbus, which needs purchasing commitments before it can go ahead with the new plane. No one questions the propriety of the purchase. But because the Bavarian leader is on the boards of both concerns, the event can in some senses be viewed as a &quot;Strauss-to-Strauss&quot; transaction.    His penchant for making his power felt is one reason Mr. Strauss has never been -- and probably won't ever be -- chancellor. In Munich, raconteurs have spent decades hunching up their shoulders a la Strauss and perfecting imitations of the premier's choky rhetorical style. But even Bavarians who ridicule Mr. Strauss acknowledge he'd be hard to replace. Mr. Strauss has presided over Bavaria's successful postwar transformation from farmland to an economy with a successful industrial sector. Bavarian growth in the past generation has strongly outpaced West Germany's.    It is a mark of the premier's might that, despite his age, few talk of his departure. But it is possible to detect some mellowing signs. At the Straubing rally, people whistled when he warned against the dangers of a possible &quot;Red-Green cartel,&quot; and he told protesters, &quot;You're just betraying your stupidity with your whistles.&quot; For some Bavarians, this wasn't enough. &quot;Many feel he's become too statesmanly in his old age,&quot; commented Ingo Weiss, an official in the county government. &quot;They like him better rough.&quot;    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
