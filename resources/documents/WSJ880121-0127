The U.S. already has a big and growing stake in Hong Kong, with some $6 billion invested overall. This suggests that American businessmen don't share Mr. Hick's apocalyptic view of China's policies toward Hong Kong and its future. This may be partly because they are aware that China -- far from undermining the Sino-British declaration -- has, with the British and Hong Kong governments, been making strenuous efforts to make sure that it is fully implemented.    Britain and China have agreed on a wide range of practical measures to implement the declaration, and to ensure Hong Kong's economic and social autonomy after 1997 -- for example, that Hong Kong should be a separate contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have its own shipping register and international air-services agreements, and continue its membership in the International Labor Organization.    China has demonstrated its commitment to Hong Kong's future through a series of large financial, corporate and real-estate investments -- the most notable recent example being the Bank of China's $42.7 million participation in the rescue package for the Hong Kong Futures Exchange. As a result, China now has a greater stake in Hong Kong than ever.    Political reform is a particularly important issue for many people in Hong Kong. But it is misleading to suggest that the Hong Kong people want direct elections and China does not. The Chinese government has made clear that it is not opposed in principle to the introduction of direct elections before 1997. Opinion in Hong Kong is not unanimous on the issue. There is support for the principle of having some element of direct election to the territory's legislature, but there are different views on the question of timing. Hong Kong authorities will publish Feb. 10 the policy &quot;White Paper&quot; for the future development of representative government, which will take full account of the views expressed by the public.    Doubts will remain about Hong Kong's future and some residents are taking out &quot;insurance policies&quot; by obtaining foreign passports. But there is nothing new about this. Hong Kong people have emigrated for decades, as the large Chinese communities in many parts of the U.S. bear witness. The rate of emigration has been conditioned largely by the availability of immigration opportunities. Last year a number of countries, including the U.S. and Canada, have substantially raised their immigration quotas for Hong Kong residents. The rate of emigration from Hong Kong has risen accordingly.    But to judge by precedent, many of those leaving will return: Some 80% of the Canadian population of Hong Kong consists of Hong Kong Chinese who chose to leave and subsequently chose to return after obtaining Canadian nationality. They return to an economy that continues to be one of the most dynamic in Asia -- 12% growth last year, 1.8% unemployment, taxes cut to 16.5% on salaries and 18% for corporations. Hong Kong is an economy that consistently mocks the claims of critics like Mr. Hicks who talk of a &quot;collapse of confidence that has now become a rout&quot; and a &quot;huge brain drain.
