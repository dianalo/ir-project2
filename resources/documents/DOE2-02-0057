<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0057 </DOCNO><TEXT>Computer technology in the eighties is at a level of maturity that couldsupport the automatic identification and mitigation of disruptions ofnormal operations in electric power systems. However, it still remainsa challenge to achieve this in real time and without substantial humanintervention. The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC) is currently undercontract to the Department of Energy to develop a computer-aided methodologyfor the on-line detection and identification of abnormal operating conditions.TASC's approach to the on-line recognition of major disturbances involvesdecomposing the power system into smaller subsystems for which real timeprocessing is feasible and developing decentralized structures for sensing,identifying and estimating disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
