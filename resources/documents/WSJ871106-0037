The move, part of a coordinated European effort to stabilize the currency markets, returned an important short-term West German rate to the level it stood at this summer, before the West German Bundesbank began a gradual tightening of money.    Bonn's policy of raising rates had irritated Mr. Baker. He felt that such a move wasn't needed to fight inflation, that it conflicted with West German pledges to stimulate domestic demand and that it led to pressure on the U.S. to follow suit, jeopardizing economic growth. In the days before the Oct. 19 stock market crash, Mr. Baker took his criticism of West German monetary policy public, and that helped to rattle an already nervous and declining stock market.    Yesterday, the West German Bundesbank set a reduced rate of 3.5% for its scheduled offering next week of securities repurchase agreements, down from 3.8% at the previous such offering, and cut its Lombard rate half a percentage point to 4.5%. The Lombard rate is the highest short-term rate charged by the central bank for supplementary borrowings.    The moves fueled speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve is about to cut its discount rate, which is its fee on loans to banks and savings institutions. But U.S. government sources said the Fed is likely to wait until the dollar has stabilized somewhat before acting.    Yesterday's Bundesbank rate moves came as the dollar was posting still further major declines against the West German mark and Japanese yen. But U.S. stock and bond markets reacted favorably to those rate-cutting moves and to yesterday's cut in many major U.S. banks' prime lending rate to 8 3/4% from 9%.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 40.12 to 1985.41. In the credit markets, prices of actively traded long-term Treasury bonds rose more than $15 for each $1,000 face amount, and the yield on 30-year issues fell to about 8.80%, the lowest since mid-August.    Both the West German rate cuts and the calmer tone of the stock and bond markets give the Reagan administration room to pursue its policy of seeking lower interest rates to prevent a recession, even at the risk of a falling dollar.    Mr. Baker expressed that view in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published yesterday, and it was affirmed by the White House later in the day. A White House spokesman said the U.S. favors currency stability -- but only if all the nations involved pursue consistent, coordinated policies and if rate rises that might bring a recession aren't needed to defend the dollar.    Bonn's latest interest-rate move might help stabilize the dollar eventually, although it didn't seem to be doing so yesterday. It also could pave the way for an agreement among major industrial countries that would amend or replace February's Louvre accord. That agreement committed the countries to pursue exchange-rate stability based on coordinated economic policies.    In the Journal interview, Mr. Baker said he hopes to seek such a pact after the administration and Congress agree on a U.S. deficit-reduction package. To the extent that West German monetary policy moves in line with U.S. policy, it could make an agreement easier to reach.    After the interview was published, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, &quot;I don't want to comment on the specifics of the remarks by Secretary Baker, other than to say, of course, that he is chief economic spokesman, and those comments do reflect the administration's position.&quot;    Mr. Fitzwater also issued a statement saying that, despite placing higher priority on keeping interest rates down than on defending the dollar, &quot;The U.S. remains committed to the Louvre agreement and will continue cooperating closely with its . . . partners to foster exchange rate stability . . . which depends upon consistent policies and performance among the major countries.&quot;    A falling dollar is an acute threat to the largely export-oriented West German economy, and it could help keep pressure on Bonn to agree to further domestic stimulus measures. The Reagan administration has been seeking such moves by both West Germany and Japan to step up their demand for U.S. goods and help trim the U.S. trade deficit.    Yesterday's rate cuts are an indication that Bonn is growing more sensitive to U.S. pressure as the dollar declines. The presence of West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at yesterday's Bundesbank council meeting suggests that he and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, who have been feeling most of that pressure, decided to lobby together for lower interest rates against colleagues who have been more preoccupied with domestic West German concerns.    There are risks to using a falling dollar to pressure West Germany, however, such as raising the possibility of a recession in West Germany and Japan.    In other interest-rate moves, Switzerland's central bank lowered its discount rate half a point to 3% yesterday. Earlier in the week, the Dutch central bank cut its discount rate by one-quarter of a point to 4.25%, and British banks cut their base lending rates half a point to 9%.    In France, monetary authorities raised money market rates yesterday to try to make the French franc more attractive in comparison with the West German mark. The French central bank's intervention rate was raised to 8.25% from 7.5%, and its interbank repurchase rate was raised to 8.75% from 8%. These closely watched rates are regarded as the lower and upper limits of daily money-market interest rates in France.    In a joint statement, the Bundesbank and the Bank of France said their actions were taken to stabilize international financial markets as well as the exchange rates within the eight-nation European Monetary System.    A senior French official said: &quot;The Germans, the Dutch, the British and the Swiss are taking measures on exchange rates, and France has taken another step. Now, the ball is in the American camp. We would like to see a clear political will by the (U.S.) government to cut the budget deficit.&quot;    For France, too, the latest rate increases are a gamble. Although they may help maintain the value of the franc against the mark and probably against the dollar, the higher rates could choke off French economic growth, which already is in some danger after the stock market crash.    &quot;We're going to run out of breath,&quot; a Paris-based currency trader said, referring to the prospect of higher interest rates. &quot;Three-quarters of a point means higher costs for French companies.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Currency Markets: Currency Tumbles on News That Preventing Its Fall Isn't Reagan's Chief Aim&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 6, 1987)    ---   Philip Revzin and Thomas Kamm contributed to this article.    ---                 Interest Rates Fall           How far rates have come down on             international money markets                                   Oct. 1       Nov. 5    Overnight Eurodollar            7.710%       6.375%    3-month Eurodollar              8.130        7.125    Overnight Eurosterling         10.250        9.125    3-month Eurosterling           10.250        8.750    Overnight Euromark              3.700        3.375    3-month Euromark                4.500        3.875    Overnight Euroyen               3.440        3.375    3-month Euroyen                 4.810        3.188   Source: Salomon Brothers</TEXT></DOC>
