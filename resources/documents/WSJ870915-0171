Proposal for Buy-outTotaling $23.1 Million</HL><DD> 09/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FNTMTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> AURORA, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Funtime Inc. said a management group led by its president, Dale W. Van Voorhis, proposed to acquire the owner and operator of theme parks in a leveraged buy-out for about $23.1 million.    The group proposed to pay $7 a share for the 2.2 million common shares outstanding and for the 1.1 million common shares represented by current convertible preferred stock outstanding.    Funtime closed in national over-the-counter trading yesterday at $6 a share, unchanged.    Mr. Van Voorhis said Funtime outside directors are expected to consider the proposal this week. He wouldn't identify the company that would help the management group finance the buy-out until Funtime directors rule on the bid. Funtime, which went public in 1969, operates Geauga Lake, in Aurora; Wyandot Lake, Columbus, Ohio; and Darien Lake in western New York.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    In its fiscal year ended last Oct. 31, Funtime earned $263,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $40.1 million. In the first nine months of fiscal 1987 ended July 26, the company's loss of $574,000 was narrower than the year-earlier loss of $1.5 million, as revenue rose to $24.9 million from $22.7 million. Because of the seasonal nature of its theme parks, Funtime's fiscal fourth quarter is usually its most profitable period. </TEXT></DOC>
