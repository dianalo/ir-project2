The new shares rose a penny (1.8 U.S. cents) on London's stock exchange, to 80 pence ($1.42), as 246 million shares changed hands. The volume total represents more than 5% of the new shares. Analysts said volume in these shares has averaged around 30 million shares a day since they began trading Oct. 30.    BP's older, fully paid shares gained three pence yesterday, to 250 pence, with 6.9 million shares changing hands.    &quot;Certainly someone has very strongly been buying new BP shares today,&quot; said Jeremy Elden, an analyst at the brokerage Phillips andamp; Drew Ltd. The Kuwait Investment Office, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, wouldn't comment on rumors that it was buying BP shares yesterday. A spokesman for BP also declined comment.    The Kuwait Investment Office also was rumored to have bought a 4.9% stake in BP two weeks ago, which some observers said would likely be held as a long-term investment. British rules require stakes of 5% or more to be declared within seven days. </TEXT></DOC>
