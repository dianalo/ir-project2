What has complicated the matter isthat the breakdown has flitted through the unit like a short in an electricalsystem. The majority of misses have been because of poor kicks by freshman JoeNedney. But there have been kicks blocked because of weak protection or poorsnaps that threw off Nedney's timing.;   As a result, Shea has had the lightson at Spartan Stadium this week to allow the kicking unit more practice time.;  The longer practices also have provided Shea with a chance to considerpossible changes. The most likely change is he'll use starting center NickTrammer as the long snapper on punts to allow freshman Tom Alkire toconcentrate on place-kick snaps.;   Look for Shea to keep the Spartans'regular offensive unit in on fourth downs unless the ball is inside the25-yard line.;   &quot;If it was a last-second kick, I'd have to stretch thedistance,&quot; Shea said. &quot;But it is a concern. (Place-kicking) has been our mostexciting play of the season.&quot;; SJS-FRESNO ST.; (box) RECORDS: San Jose Stateis 6-3-1 overall, 6-0 in the Big West Conference.
