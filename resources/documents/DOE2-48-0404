The Strawn trend newLovington comprises numerous small (200-800 ac) reservoirs of clean algallimestone encased in unfossiliferous carbonate mudrocks. Vuggy porosityoccurs in algal micrites and sporadically in crinoidal or foraminiferalgrainstones associated with the mound. Some of the Lovington area fieldsencountered downdip water, but difficulty in finding the mound faciesremains the principal dry-hole hazard. Vague acoustical boundaries complicateseismic detection of relatively minor (50-150 ft) carbonate buildupsat depths of 11,200-11,600 ft. Stratigraphic interpretation of high-resolutionseismic data recently led to several new field discoveries and majorextensions. Development drilling, however, can be an even greater challengeto reservoir prediction. Humble City South field illustrates the difficultyof developing a stratigraphic oil field in an area of poor seismic definitionand sparse well control. A shooting program following the wildcat discoveryonly heightened confusion about the size and shape of the new reservoir.Two subsequent dry holes missed the mound entirely and provided onlynegative control. Seismic modeling, careful stratigraphic interpretation,and saturation coverage with a three-dimensional seismic project ultimatelydefined the existing reservoir and revealed the presence of a separate,nearby pool. Exact reservoir delineation remains difficult, but thisprogram presented the first clear picture of overall mount geometry.The Humble City experience showed that three-dimensional seismic canbe an important tool in the critical period following a wildcat discovery.</TEXT></DOC>
