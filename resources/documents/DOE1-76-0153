The export is assumed to reach a peak of ca 28 billionm3 in 1989. Recently great interest has been shown in Norway for gasin the Norwegian energy supply, both for electric qower production anddirect application. An agreement has been reached between Statoil andStatkraft for sale of gas to a planned power plant on the west coastof Norway, based on natural gas from the North Sea. The agreement impliesdeliveries up to an amount of l billion m3 gas per year for 25 yearsfrom l99l. Of special interest for the Norwegian gas export is the Swedishmarket, which seems to have a considerable growth potential. Due to itsgeographical position, Haltenbanken appears as the perhaps most interestingregion for energy export to Sweden. The export may be in the form ofelectricity (power plant in Norway) or as gas transported in a pipe.4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
