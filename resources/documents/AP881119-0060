Riot police fired tear gas and blocked streets to stop students,workers and dissidents from marching on City Hall to demandpunishment of the former president for alleged corruption and humanrights abuses.   ``Execute Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!''columns of marchers shouted as they paraded through the city centerafter nightfall. ``Return stolen wealth to the people!'' they yelled.   Police armored vans fired volleys of choking tear gas into theranks of the marchers to stop them from advancing on City Hall.Students hurled firebombs and rocks at police in clashes thatswirled through the city center.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, estimated about 12,000people took part in the protests. Hankook Ilbo, a leading Seoulnewspaper, estimated the number of protesters at 20,000.   Smaller, peaceful protests involving at least 6,000 people werereported in the provincial cities of Chongju, Kwangju, Taegu, Chonjuamd Pusan.   Dissident groups had called for nationwide protests Saturday todemand Chun's arrest for alleged abuses under his authoritariangovernment. Protest leaders also called for the overthrow ofPresident Roh, contending he is a front for continued military rule.   The Roh government is trying to defuse public anger against Chun,a former general, without being implicated in the furor. Roh, also aformer general, was a close associate of Chun.   Violence erupted in Seoul when riot police blocked about 5,000people from marching to Chun's home after they held a rally atDaehak-ro in central Seoul. Protesters tried to force their waythrough police blocking the road, and troopers responded with teargas grenades.   Screaming students carrying iron and wooden clubs hurled hundredsof firebombs and rocks at police but were unable to break throughthe wall of police shields.   Protesters then filtered into the city center, where theirnumbers swelled and several large columns marched through the mainshopping district. Marchers yelled slogans and sang songs as theyshot their fists into the air.   Some protesters yelled ``Yankee go home!'' and otheranti-American slogans. Dissidents are opposed to the presense of42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defensepact.   Riot police opened fire with tear gas several times. Protesterstrying to reach City Hall were driven back twice.   Angry students attacked police vehicles with firebombs, settingfire to at least two, and attacked a police station. Protestersbroke up sidewalk paving stones to hurl at police. Fightingcontinued in sidestreets for several hours.   Police officials, who said about 15,000 riot police were fieldedin Seoul to block the protests, had no immediate word on arrests orinjuries.   Some onlookers cheered or applauded the protesters, but manypeople in the Saturday afternoon shopping crowds watched silently.   Chun, who stepped down in February at the end of a seven-yearterm, is expected to apologize to the nation and turn over a portionof his wealth to the government to atone for alleged corruptionunder his administration. Chun took power with military backing in1980.   The former president denies any personal wrongdoing, but severalof his relatives and associates have been convicted or charged withcorruption involving millions of dollars in official funds andforced contributions from businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
