Walsh can focus on trying thenext major case, against North's former boss John M. Poindexter.   Poindexter, who was national security adviser to PresidentReagan, not only is charged with obstructing congressionalinquiries into the Iran-Contra affair; he also faces the centralconspiracy counts that were dropped against North when the Bushadministration refused to disclose secret documents needed by thedefense.   Because Poindexter, unlike North, had daily contact with Reagan,his trial could shed new light on how closely the former presidentmight have been involved in the secret plans to sell arms to Iranand to keep the Contras going after official U.S. aid was banned.   The case against Poindexter is expected to go to trial inSeptember.   Before then, a lower-ranking figure in the affair, former CIAagent Joseph F. Fernandez, is to go to trial July 10.   Fernandez has pleaded innocent to four charges that he lied andobstructed investigations by the presidential commission headed byformer Sen. John Tower and by the CIA's inspector general.   The former CIA station chief in Costa Rica is accused of lyingabout his role in setting up an airstrip in Costa Rica as part ofthe Reagan administration's effort to help the Nicaraguan rebels ata time when official U.S. aid was banned.   As for Poindexter, Walsh has expressed determination to pressforward against him with charges that were dropped against North:That the two men and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V.Secord conspired to divert $15 million in U.S.-Iran arms-saleprofits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The independent counsel told U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.Robinson Jr. that release of secret documents during North's trial_ and a softening of the intelligence agencies' opposition tofurther disclosures _ may enable the prosecution to proceed withthose charges against Poindexter.   Walsh also said that some of the most sensitive documents ajudge ruled were needed in North's trial were not relevant toPoindexter's case.   Many of the documents the government kept out of North's trialdealt with covert operations to free U.S. hostages in the MiddleEast and other secret activities in Central America.   As a participant in covert operations, North persuaded U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell that he needed the material tohelp his defense. When it was kept secret, the conspiracy chargesagainst North were dropped.   But Walsh is expected to argue that since Poindexter was not aparticipant in covert operations, he is not entitled to use thesame documents to defend the charges that he was a participant in aconspiracy to defraud the U.S. government of arms-sale profits.   Since North testified that Poindexter knew of his role in theIran-Contra affair, prosecutors may force the former NationalSecurity Council aide to testify against his former boss.   A judge could order North to testify against Poindexter oncondition that his testimony not be used as evidence against him ifhe is granted a new trial by an appellate court.   Poindexter, 52, is also charged with obstructing 1986investigations of the House and Senate intelligence committees intothe Iran-Contra affair. The charges include allegations he helpedprepare a false chronology of the U.S.-Iran arms deals anddestroyed computerized files he kept at the NSC.   The seven charges against Poindexter each carry five-year prisonterms and $250,000 fines.   After Poindexter's trial, Walsh's office plans to proceed withthe charges against Hakim and Secord, also scheduled to be triedseparately.</TEXT></DOC>
