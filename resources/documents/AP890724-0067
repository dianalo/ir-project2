McDowell, chief of the department's publicintegrity section, said in a letter to agency officials.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., released the letter as a Housesubcommittee resumed hearings into mismanagement andinfluence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration. He alsocharged that many witnesses during the hearings appeared to havecommitted perjury and that the Justice Department should conductits own investigations instead of relying on Congress or HUD torefer cases for investigation.   Frank did not name the witnesses to whom he was referring.   In the letter, dated July 19, the Justice Department told HUDInspector General Paul Adams it would not prosecute former HUDAssistant Secretary Thomas Demery in connection with an inspectorgeneral's report criticizing the selection process HUD used toaward rent subsidies to developers who promised to renovate housingfor low-income people.   In the inspector general's report, Adams and his investigatorssaid many of the developers who received subsidies had been majorcontributors to FOOD for Africa, a Michigan-based charity thatDemery helped establish.   Frank did not criticize the department's decision on Demery butcomplained Justice Department officials had indicated they wouldnot conduct their own investigations into the emerging HUD scandals.   The first witness at today's hearing was William Taylor, amember of the Republican National Committee and former chairman ofthe Florida State Republican Party. Taylor was criticized bycommittee members but defended his use of his RNC stationery inletters to HUD officials lobbying for HUD projects.   ``I find nothing wrong with letting people know who I am,'' saidTaylor. He said his lobbying business included numerous HUD-relatedclients.   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported today that federalhousing officials approved more than $16 million in rent subsidiesfor a Denver housing project after Joseph Coors, the wealthyColorado brewer and a friend of President Reagan, wrote a letterendorsing the project.   The committee also was scheduled to hear testimony from LyndaMurphy, a former career HUD employee, about her dealings with herfriend, Deborah Gore Dean, former executive assistant tothen-Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce.   Ms. Murphy, who left HUD in 1982, was an attorney for DRGFunding Corp., a lender which has been indefinitely suspended fromdoing business with the department because of a high incidence ofloan defaults.   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the panel isseeking to use other witnesses to find out about the role of Ms.Dean, who has refused to testify based on her constitutional rightagainst self-incrimination.   ``Miss Dean has chosen to take the Fifth Amendment, and we verymuch hope that she will change her mind,'' Lantos said in aninterview. ``So we will attempt to ascertain through these otherwitnesses to what extent she was calling the shots and to whatextent it was Secretary Pierce.''   Pierce himself has said that he was not involved in many of theday-to-day decisions at the department and testified that he didnot personally order funding for any project.   However, those statements were contradicted by a later witness,Shirley McVay Wiseman. Pierce is to appear before the panel againin August and September.   Lantos has said the panel is not considering granting legalimmunity for Ms. Dean under which her testimony could not be usedagainst her in any future prosecution.   A number of witnesses before the subcommittee have said that Ms.Dean's support for a project was crucial in any attempt to getmoney from HUD.   Big-name Republicans, such as former Interior Secretary JamesWatt, or former high-ranking HUD employees used their contacts toobtain the funding.   The Times report said Coors' endorsement two years ago came asthe Denver request appeared headed for rejection. The paper basedits report on internal government documents.   It also quoted Demery as saying a HUD selection committee wastold that Pierce wanted the Denver application given ``very carefulconsideration, which it was.''   Documents showed the Denver proposal was originally left off alist of 1987 applications to be recommended for financing, theTimes said.   On Aug. 12, 1987, Coors wrote Pierce urging him to ``look intothis matter and give it your favorable approval.'' One week afterthe letter was written, the selection panel met in Washington andapproved the Denver request, the Times said documents showed.   The Times said there was no indication that Coors had afinancial interest in the project, characterizing his support forit instead as being motivated by civic pride.</TEXT></DOC>
