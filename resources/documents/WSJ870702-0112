But while these accounting moves helped the banks with their investors by bringing much of the bad news into the open, the world debt problem remains. And it may be complicated by the accounting decisions.    The difficulty for the less-developed countries will be getting new bank loans, now that some existing ones are seen by banks themselves as worth less than full face value. Big banks insist they will continue lending to debtor countries that pursue sensible economic policies. But many analysts are skeptical.    &quot;The only new bank loans that will go ahead will be ones where banks really expect to get their money back,&quot; predicts F. Gerard Adams, a University of Pennsylvania economics professor. A few larger Latin American debtors -- such as Mexico and Venezuela -- may be the only countries in this category, he believes.    In particular, adds Paul Sachs of Multinational Strategies Inc., a consulting firm, &quot;It's going to be impossible to get many smaller and medium-sized banks to come into new loans.&quot;    Mr. Sachs and other analysts say that to ensure that Third World lending continues, the governments of Western nations and of Japan, along with international agencies such as the World Bank, may eventually have to chip in more. But the industrialized nations show few signs of committing more money to international lending agencies.    Since big debtor countries haven't adjusted their economies enough to end their craving for credit, the result may be that not all their loan needs will be met. If not, their economies will suffer, and they probably won't be able to pay all the interest due on their existing bank debt.    One likely result is that talks between banks and troubled debtors will become tougher and relations more strained. Banks may be forced to roll overdue interest into new loans. And another result for big U.S. banks, say many bankers, economists and other experts, could be that they will have to make another round of huge additions to loss reserves within the next few years.    The first test of banks' willingness to continue lending is a proposed $1.95 billion credit for Argentina. After 2 1/2 months, during which Argentina and its biggest bank creditors have lobbied hard with other banks to join in the loan, about $1.87 billion has been collected. But this comes from only slightly more than half of the country's 300 bank lenders world-wide. Financiers expect that many smaller U.S. banks will balk and that to induce them to begin joining the loan, the terms will have to be modified.    Measures are being taken to make the loan more attractive. The World Bank has agreed to co-finance part of it, and banks are being offered a range of different ways to participate. For instance, a bank would be permitted to make up to $5 million of its contribution in so-called exit bonds, which it could sell. These bonds could still be more attractively priced in an attempt to draw the many smaller lenders.    With this loan still in negotiation, other Latin debtors are lining up for credit. Venezuela wants about $1 billion. Colombia, which has never rescheduled its foreign debt, also seeks about $1 billion in new credit. Brazil wants the banks to provide more than $4 billion in new credit to cover overdue interest.    Meanwhile, the economic backdrop to the international debt problem is worsening. Growth of industrialized nations' economies is expected to average only about 2% this year, compared with nearly 3% last year. Protectionist pressures continue strong. U.S. interest rates have risen, adding to borrowers' cost to service their debt. And inflation has heated up in nearly all Latin American countries, reaching, for instance, a rate of over 1,000% in Brazil.    Even the banks' leading debt firefighter, Citicorp executive William R. Rhodes, is wary on the outlook. &quot;With the apparent slowing of the international economy, the continuing depressed state of commodity prices, protectionism and the recent rise of interest rates, we aren't facing an easy period ahead,&quot; he says.    In fact, more big developing countries are at an impasse with creditors than in many years. Ecuador, ravaged by an earthquake, has stopped making interest payments on its international bank debt. Peru, Bolivia and Costa Rica aren't current on interest for most of their foreign borrowings. And Argentina is beginning to stray from economic guidelines agreed to with the International Monetary Fund.    &quot;The list of troubled debtors is getting longer every day,&quot; says Gregory Fager of the Institute of International Finance in Washington, a research group funded by commercial banks.    Leading the list as the developing world's biggest debtor nation is Brazil, which last February declared a moratorium on interest payments on international bank debt. Brazil later forced the extension of short-term trade and money-market credits from abroad. And yesterday it suspended principal payments on $1.05 billion owed to industrialized countries' export-import banks.    Last month Brazil proposed an economic plan relying on such orthodox measures as cutting budget deficits and seeking to increase exports. However, the program has yet to be approved by legislators, and even if it is, it will have to be negotiated with foreign creditors. Many analysts think the country's $4.3 billion of overdue interest will have to be capitalized by banks, meaning that it would be rolled up into new loans.    Japanese and European banks can capitalize overdue interest with impunity, but if U.S. and Canadian institutions do so they must, at the least, classify the loans as non-performing. Regulators also may require them to provide some reserves against these loans.    International efforts to ease the debt crisis are bogged down. Chief among these efforts is Treasury Secretary James Baker's 1985 plan calling for debtor nations to make their economies more efficient and export-oriented, in return for World Bank credits and new bank loans. This plan is, of course, jeopardized by any increased reluctance on the part of lenders. The new commercial-bank lending in particular &quot;is seriously in question,&quot; says Alan Stoga of Kissinger Associates Inc., a consulting firm. &quot;And if the Baker plan is a stool with only two legs,&quot; he says, &quot;it'll fall over.&quot;    World Bank lending hasn't risen much either, in part because it hasn't received big increases in resources. Nor have other development banks taken up the slack; plans to increase the lending of the Inter-American Development Bank foundered recently on a dispute between the U.S. and Latin American countries.    The drive needed to reinvigorate the Baker plan seems lacking. The recent Venice economic summit produced only a pallid reiteration of its principles. World economic leaders are more occupied with America's trade and budget deficits and the reluctance of Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies.    In addition, two of the most experienced international debt managers have recently stepped down, IMF Managing Director Jacques Delarosiere and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker (who remains in office until next month). Many analysts expect a less-activist approach to the debt problem from Alan Greenspan, the Fed nominee, than from his predecessor. Mr. Greenspan, awaiting nomination hearings, declined to discuss his approach.    Mr. Volcker was the main architect of the Baker plan and worked hard to see that it was followed. Last fall, for example, he prodded banks to make $7.7 billion in new loans to Mexico, infuriating Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, and some other senior bankers. They felt the total was more than Mexico needed and resented being dictated to by Mr. Volcker, who supported Mexico's request for interest-rate concessions.    But in May Mr. Reed himself became the most influential international-debt strategist. His announcement of a $3 billion addition to his bank's reserves for future loan losses set off the string of reserve additions by other U.S. banks. The flowing red ink will make second-period bank results the worst for any quarter since the 1930s and 1987 the worst full year since 1961, says James McDermott, senior analyst at the firm of Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.    But the reserve action has advantages for the big banks, as their stock gains suggest. It gives them flexibility, making it easier to swap loans for equity in debtor nations. And, says Werner Blessing of West Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, &quot;The negotiating position of the banks will be strengthened. It gives a bank more leeway to avoid coming under pressure from the debtor.&quot; Deutsche Bank has long pursued a policy of building high reserves.    Mr. Reed acted because he saw banks making ever-greater concessions and enduring shrinking profit margins, while debtor countries drifted away from the discipline of the free market. He also tired of being dictated to by the U.S. government and wanted to challenge some assumptions of previous debt strategy.    Citicorp's move has divided the banking community. Weaker banks aren't happy, and many bank analysts suspect Mr. Reed was motivated partly by competitive considerations -- that he wanted to contrast Citicorp's strength with the condition of some weaker money-center competitors.    Senior executives at Manufacturers Hanover Corp., one of the biggest lenders to Latin America, were appalled by Citicorp's move. The two giant banks already had clashed; Mr. Reed and Manufacturers Chairman John McGillicuddy got into a row over recent settlements for Chile and the Philippines, with Mr. Reed losing his argument for harsher terms.    Some observers blame Mr. Reed's more combative approach for much of the latest international-debt squeeze. &quot;The macho attitude of the banks may be what has triggered&quot; Brazil's moratorium on interest payments in February, says Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a managing director of First Boston Corp. and a former Peruvian government minister.    While Mr. Reed searches aggressively for a solution, swapping and selling his bank's developing-country debts, his patient subordinate Mr. Rhodes continues to lobby with banks to participate in the new Argentine loan, as does Argentina itself. &quot;The Argentines have been in the Midwest hitting on all their creditors individually,&quot; says a senior loan officer at a big Midwestern bank.    He adds, &quot;They clearly wouldn't be here but for Citicorp's reserve decision.&quot;    ---          BIG LENDERS TO LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES                  (In billions of dollars)                              Added        1986       1987                   Loans      to loss    earnings   earnings                   to LDCs    reserves     loss      (loss) Citibank          $15.59      $3.0       $1.06     ($1.00) BankAmerica        10.00       1.1       (0.52)     (0.75) Manufacturers       8.4        1.7        0.41      (1.05) Chase               8.7        1.6        0.59      (0.85) J.P.IMorgan          6.0*        **        0.87*      0.92* Chemical            5.9        1.1        0.40      (0.71) Bankers Trust       4.0        0.7        0.43      (0.18) First Chicago       2.8        0.8        0.28      (0.44) Security Pacific    1.9        0.5        0.39       0.15 Wells Fargo         1.9         **        0.27*      0.33* First Interstate    1.6        0.75       0.34      (0.20)   *Estimated   **Nothing added so far in 1987   Source: IBCA   ---                DEBTORS' INTEREST COSTS RISE                              Rise in yearly    Rise in debt                              debt service per  service cost              International   1-point rise in    since Dec.
