Because legal fees and all expenses must be approved by the bankruptcy judge, the firms must submit detailed fee applications. To many firms' chagrin, these applications are public.    In the case of the recent Texaco Inc. bankruptcy proceedings, the applications reveal a high degree of liquidity -- on the part of the lawyers. Attorneys representing Texaco and its creditors' and shareholders' committees stand to walk away with some $21 million in legal fees and expenses for about 13 months of work.    The top-billing firm: Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges, Texaco's main bankruptcy firm, with fees and expenses of $8.3 million. Next comes Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, which seeks bankruptcy court approval for a $4.5 million tab. The Cravath bill includes $118,000 for photocopying and $145,000 for messengers and car service.    One Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore partner, Francis Barron, billed Texaco for an extraordinary 3,362 hours during this period, more than 60 hours a week. At $230 an hour, Mr. Barron's work alone cost $773,260. (While billing somewhat fewer hours, David Boies, who heads Cravath's Texaco team, charged a higher rate of $300 an hour.)    Cravath started doing substantial work for Texaco after the company lost a $10.53 billion judgment to Pennzoil in state court in Houston. In addition to handling Texaco's appeal and helping negotiate the ultimate $3 billion settlement, Cravath has worked on the company's bankruptcy and tax problems and has advised it in efforts to protect against an unsolicited takeover. In the process, the firm has eclipsed Texaco's longtime counsel Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler. Kaye, Scholer billed a relatively scant $2.9 million during the bankruptcy period.    Court Decisions Leave   Room for Confusion   IS THERE a &quot;science&quot; of law, or are most judicial opinions the product of politics or whim? Chalk up another defeat for science.    Thus far 119 federal trial judges have ruled on whether new federal sentencing guidelines are constitutional. And the judges are split by a score of 70-49, with the naysayers in the lead.    Why can't the judges agree on what seems to be a straightforward constitutional question?    For one thing, the question here is hardly straightforward. The guidelines, intended to make criminal sentences more consistent, were issued by a federal commission that was set up by Congress. But it isn't clear under separation-of-powers doctrine whether the commission has the constitutional authority to make rules that are binding on judges.    The reason the disagreement is so visible is that every judge faced with a sentencing decision has to decide whether to abide by the guidelines. If he doesn't follow the new rules, he has to explain why they are unconstitutional. For this reason, says constitutional law specialist Laurence Tribe, &quot;The rolling score keeps mounting out of all proportion to the issue's importance.&quot;    The Supreme Court is expected to step in on an emergency basis and resolve the issue next fall without waiting for federal appeals courts to decide the question first. Meanwhile, though, the criminal-justice system has been thrown into disarray, with neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers knowing which rules apply.    Was the wide split among judges avoidable? Mr. Tribe, a professor at Harvard, doesn't think so. Many of the most important Supreme Court cases of modern times were decided by 5-4 votes, he notes. And the split among trial judges on the sentencing issue reflects the fact that there are good constitutional arguments on both sides of the question.    Still, others disagree. Alan Morrison, a public-interest lawyer who is challenging the guidelines, says the separation-of-powers question &quot;leaps out at anyone who has been to law school.&quot; He blames Congress and the Justice Department for not analyzing the constitutional problem in advance.    Looking Outside For   Harvard Law Dean   HARVARD LAW School has always looked to its own faculty when it came time to pick a new dean. No more.    A six-person committee chaired by Prof. Tribe is conducting a national search for a leader to replace James Vorenberg, who has announced that next school year will be his last as dean. The faculty has split in recent years over tenure decisions and philosophical differences about how law should be taught. While Mr. Tribe says that the committee will certainly consider homegrown candidates, he adds: &quot;We're taking very seriously the possibility of finding somebody outside.&quot;    The final choice belongs not to the search committee but to Harvard University President Derek Bok.    How Much Lawyers Use   Computers and Phones   COMPUTERS HAVE come slowly to law firms, but the process now seems to be nearly complete.    In a readership survey of American Bar Association members, the ABA Journal found that more than 90% of law firms surveyed own or lease computers. That's up from 78% in 1987.    The same study reveals that some less recent technology, the telephone, is also getting a workout: The average lawyer makes about 55 business phone calls a week. Wondering why you get so much static when you talk to your lawyer on the phone? Almost one-third of all lawyers surveyed now have a telephone in their car. </TEXT></DOC>
