The changes, which don't go as far as some people in theWhite House and Congress would like, are being reviewed atthe Office of Management and Budget. The proposals aresupported by Administrator William Reilly of theEnvironmental Protection Agency.</LP><TEXT>   The changes are included in a draft revision of a 1989technical manual used for determining which marshes andswamps are eligible for wetlands protection. Once land islisted as a wetlands, landowners must obtain federal permitsbefore any development can proceed.   The definition of wetlands is critical to carrying outPresident Bush's campaign pledge to work toward &quot;no net loss&quot;of wetlands. Many administration officials contend that themanual's language is so broad that it is unworkable,affording protection to acreage that doesn't deserve it andencouraging developers to skirt the requirements.   &quot;What we've done is to try to clarify the reach of our ownauthority, making clear that certain characteristics must bepresent for us to conclude an area is wet,&quot; Mr. Reilly said.   Environmentalists and some administration officialsattacked the proposal, however, contending that it wouldresult in a loss of legitimate wetlands. Steve Moyer,legislative representative for the National WildlifeFederation, said the proposed changes &quot;go too far.&quot;   The revised manual was prepared by the EPA, the InteriorDepartment's Fish and Wildlife Service, the AgricultureDepartment's Soil Conservation Service and the Army Corps ofEngineers. The Fish and Wildlife Service, however, has strongreservations about the proposed changes and hopes to improvethem, an Interior Department spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
