The October 1987 stock market crash turned Mexico's Bolsa de Valores from the fastest growing market in the world to the fastest falling market, triggering a financial panic and peso devaluation.    Since reaching its low of 47,224 last January, Mexico's stock index has marched back to 191,816. Still, that is only a little more than 50% of its pre-crash peak of 373,216. Worse, small investors have all but deserted the market, sending volume tumbling to about one-fourth of its level before Black Monday. The lethargy reflects persistent doubts about the security and honesty of investing in Mexico's market.    &quot;The country will never develop a viable capital market until something is done to resolve the irregularities exposed by the crash,&quot; says Samuel del Villar, a lawyer and academic who helped design the government's program to fight corruption in the public sector.    The National Stock Commission has levied fines equivalent to about $500,000 against several brokerages, but this hasn't ended the controversy about the crash. When the director of operations at the stock exchange tried to commit suicide this summer, local press reports attributed the tragedy to the discovery of irregularities in the exchange's options trading operations. (The exchange maintains that the suicide attempt was the result of personal problems, and the official remains in a coma.) Meanwhile, a lawyer with ties to Mexico's resurgent political left is heading hundreds of lawsuits against brokerages and a damaging campaign in the press to discredit the stock market.    For now at least, the Bolsa's woes have blocked what was emerging as a promising avenue for improvement in Mexico's ailing economy. The strong local stock market had appeared the best hope for repatriating at least part of the estimated $50 billion that has left Mexico in the form of capital flight. It also offered promise for evolving into a sound source of financing for Mexican corporations, whose excessive reliance on bank loans helped fuel the country's debt crisis.    &quot;If we are ever to see economic growth without indebtedness, a sound capital market will be critical,&quot; says Moises Tiktin, director of economic analysis for Valores Finamex, a leading brokerage.    But instead of offering answers to Mexico's economic problems, the Bolsa now seems to offer a textbook case in the growing pains of a developing world stock market. The groundwork for Mexico's stock market boom and bust was laid early in the term of President de la Madrid. He liberalized Mexico's financial markets to win back the support of financiers, who had been alienated after his predecessor nationalized the banks.    Between 1985 and 1987, the number of brokerage offices more than doubled to 245 and the number of accounts more than tripled. In a move that now is widely questioned, the government opened the market to small investors by sharply reducing the minimum allowable investment just months before the crash. In dollar terms, the market grew 330% in the first nine months of 1987. &quot;In retrospect, it's clear that the growth was too dynamic, attracting too many inexperienced brokers and investors,&quot; says Carlos Leroux, an executive at the investment house Cremi.    The market actually began its slide a couple of weeks before Black Monday, when the government halted trading in the midst of one spectacular rally, unnerving investors wary of government intervention. But the international stock markets' crash turned the Mexican market's correction into a collapse, and uncovered the speculative fever behind the market boom.    One large retail chain was hit with losses of more than $1 million after the crash, when it discovered that the corporate treasurer had illegally diverted the company's funds into the market. The owner was forced to sell two of his most profitable outlets to pay off his market debts. Even harder, he says, was firing the treasurer, who happened to be his son-inlaw. &quot;The market boom was like a drug that corrupted honest people,&quot; the owner says.    Cesar Fentanes, the lawyer who is heading the suits against the brokerages, says his clients include the treasury departments of two state governments and the pension fund of one of Mexico's largest unions -- all of whom were caught up in the speculative surge.    A move is on to buff up the market's image. The association of brokerages recently published its first ethics code, and the government has placed restrictions on public officials' stockholdings.    Analysts also add that technical factors are playing a role in the market's malaise. Because of jitters in the exchange market, interest rates on government treasury bills remain high, making them a more attractive investment option than stocks. Analysts say last week's U.S. government authorization of $3.5 billion in loans to Mexico could bolster confidence in the exchange market, which should send interest rates tumbling and strengthen the stock market.    ---   World Market Activity   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost ground in Saturday's half-day of trading after a three-session upswing.    The 225-issue Nikkei stock average fell 62.85 to close at 27338.57. It climbed 10.87 during Friday's full day of trading.    About 450 million shares traded, compared with about 1 billion Friday.    In early trading in Tokyo on Monday, the Nikkei index rose 34.91 points to 27373.48 points.    Trading was bullish Friday morning, responding to the rally in New York Thursday. But the momentum wore off in the afternoon, and stocks closed with only a slight rise. The pessimism continued into Saturday's trading.    &quot;It is a continuation of what has been going on for some time,&quot; said Bruce Babcock, a market strategist with Prudential-Bache in Japan. On one hand, Japan sees the merits of lower oil prices and lower interest rates that will help the market, but uncertainties associated with an insider-trading stock scandal, tax changes -- particularly the treatment of capital gains -- and Emperor Hirohito's long illness are pushing in the other direction.    London share prices finished down in mild activity, as traders sought to consolidate positions in what one dealer described as &quot;a bit of unwinding&quot; after an &quot;overbought&quot; week.    The Financial Times 100-share index was down 5.0 at 1859.3, slightly better than the day's low of 1858.8. The 30-share index closed off 3.2 at 1509.3. Volume was thin, at 482.3 million shares.    Wall Street's decline weighed on London equities, traders said. One dealer said the annual Mansion House speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson Thursday night gave the market a bearish tone. &quot;He's trying to talk the economy and the pound lower,&quot; one market maker said. Mr. Lawson reiterated that high U.K. interest rates will cause inflation to peak during 1989, but he again said this will take time to affect the economy fully. He also said higher interest rates might not have a significant effect on Britain's huge current account deficit until 1990.    Frankfurt share prices closed mostly lower in moderately active trading Friday as an early rally fizzled amid position-squaring before the weekend and uncertainty about the lower dollar. The DAX index dropped 5.49 to 1289.72. After opening broadly higher, the tide turned at midday, when the dollar's slide to a three-month low began to worry market participants.    Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Paris, were mixed in Amsterdam and ended lower in Milan.    Prices closed higher in Manila, Singapore, Sydney and Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and fell in Taipei and Seoul.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                              % This                        Oct. 20    Oct. 19     Year    U.S. ............... 260.6      255.1     + 13.6    Britain ............ 564.3      563.5     +  9.4    Canada ............. 369.8      366.4     +  5.5    Japan ..............1277.0     1272.3     + 24.9    France ............. 404.1      404.5     + 40.1    Germany ............ 200.3      203.2     + 27.9    Hong Kong ......... 1916.8     1924.3     + 16.6    Switzerland......... 168.3      168.1     + 19.6    Australia .......... 315.5      312.9     + 21.7    World index ........ 468.8      464.2     + 14.9</TEXT></DOC>
