President Alan Garcia announced Saturday that OccidentalPetroleum Corp. had discovered an estimated 600 million barrels ofoil in a remote area, which if confirmed would more than doublePeru's current proven reserves.   Garcia valued the oil at $10 billion or more, and said it wouldsupply Peru's domestic needs and export requirements for 15 years.   Gaston Acurio of the opposition center-right party Popular Actionsaid in a radio interview Monday that the government must ``offersufficient guarantees to foreign companies to ensure the oil doesnot remain below the ground.''   Garcia's announcement came against a background of strainedrelations between the impoverished South American nation and foreigncompanies.   Several foreign oil concerns operated in Peru during the late1970s after oil was discovered in the Amazon and oil became Peru'smajor foreign exchange earner.   Since then, political unrest and changing policies havefrightened most foreign firms, while restricting Occidental and thestate oil company Petro-Peru from expanding production andexploration.   Since Garcia took office in mid-1985, the government hasnationalized a handful of foreign companies and taken other stepsconsidered hostile to investment from abroad, including limits onrepayment of foreign loans.   Occidental now is the only foreign oil company actively exploringoil production, the government says.   Officials did not comment Monday on the possibility of financingPeru's estimated $19 billion foreign debt with potential income fromthe reported jungle oil find.   Crude production has fallen during the decade from a high ofnearly 200,000 barrels a day to 140,000 barrels, slightly more thanPeru needs for domestic use.   Former Finance Minister Javier Silva, a senator from the centristSolidarity and Democracy Party, charged Garcia overestimated the oildiscovery in an effort to divert attention from the nation'sproblems.   ``I fear we are dealing once again with a smoke curtain to hide agrave internal situation marked by leftist guerrilla violence and aneconomic crisis,'' he was quoted by the Lima newspaper Expreso assaying.   Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company a year ago announced the discoveryof natural gas in a jungle zone near the Ucayali region estimated at7 trillion cubic feet, the energy equivalent of 1.2 billion barrelsof oil.   But a tentative contract with Shell to produce the gas wasscrapped amid bitter internal debate led by leftist politicians, whosaid the contract exploited the Peruvians.   A year ago, the government revealed a tentative contractexploration contract had been reached with Mobil Oil Corp. but thefirm denied the statement a day later.   Occidental Petroleum spokesman Armando Lasarte Monday refused toconfirm or deny any of the comments made by Garcia concerning thediscovery and its estimated size. He referred further questions tothe state oil company Petro-Peru, which also refused to comment.   Industry analysts said it will take at least two years and costmore than $2 billion to contruct a pipeline from the zone over thetwo-mile high Andes to coastal population centers.   Officials also said such a pipeline would face sabotage by MaoistShining Path guerrillas, whose nearly nine-year insurgency hasclaimed more than 12,000 lives and caused damage of more than $10billion.</TEXT></DOC>
