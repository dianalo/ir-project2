(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite dramatic rescues, authorities hadlittle hope today that more survivors could be extricated frombetween massive slabs of concrete sandwiched together on Interstate880.   An army of construction workers maneuvered cranes around thefallen, 18-block section of the elevated double-decker freewaywhile rescuers used dogs and electronic sensors to search for signsof life.   Wood-and-pipe supports were placed under rubble along a portionof the collapsed freeway so workers could safely map the locationsand conditions of smashed cars, police Sgt. Alan White said today.It will take several days to place hundreds of supports, and themapping can't be completed until then.   As darkness fell Wednesday, police Capt. Jim Hahn said no onehad been recovered during the day and he doubted there were moresurvivors.   More than 250 rush-hour commuters were feared crushed to deathbetween the decks of I-880, the Nimitz Freeway, which collapsedduring Tuesday's quake.   The search was moving ``slowly and meticulously'' because thehighway was like ``a house of cards'' that could flatten at anymoment, said Kyle Nelson of the California Department ofTransportation.   Mayor Lionel Wilson was telling reporters Wednesday evening thatthe search had found no survivors when police Lt. Kristina Wraainterrupted to say one had been discovered. Hahn later dismissedthe report as garbled communication.   Tuesday night, rescuers were able to pull one man alive from acar crushed to a height of 18 inches, said passerby PatrickMacIntyre, and emergency workers pulled a girl from the wreckage ofanother automobile.   In perhaps the most dramatic, ghastly rescue, doctors freed a6-year-old from a car after firefighters cut through the body ofthe child's dead mother.   Dr. Jim Betts, lying on his stomach in the car crushed betweenthe decks, was forced to amputate the boy's right leg, whilefirefighters struggled to contain blazes that consumed vehicles oneither side of the car.   ``It was appalling. It was terrible,'' said Dr. Jack Ellis, oneof two other surgeons working with Betts. ``We're used to havingthem brought to the hospital, not doing surgery under a concretebeam.''   The child, Julio Berumen, was in critical condition Wednesday atChildren's Hospital.   The child's mother and another adult in the car were killed whena pillar of the highway sliced through the vehicle during thetemblor, said fire Capt. Ron Carter.   Gov. George Deukmejian speculated the highway collapse was theresult of substandard construction. He called for an investigation.State transportation officials said the freeway, one of the area'soldest, had been reinforced and was considered earthquake-safe.   Some years back bumper stickers reading, ``Pray for Me, I Drivethe Nimitz,'' appeared in the East Bay, but were presumed to dealmore with the highway's narrow lanes and concrete barriers than thethreat of earthquake damage.   During Tuesday evening's rush hour, screams and the crash ofmetal brought residents of the surrounding neighborhood inimpoverished West Oakland to the scene.   ``They climbed up on the bridge to take people off. They linedup to volunteer. They established medical help as soon aspossible,'' Police Lt. Larry Eade said. ``I didn't see one instanceof a citizen that didn't cooperate.''   Dorothy Otto said she was driving on the lower deck when thequake hit.   ``Suddenly the road started to bounce,'' she said. ``The carswere like ping pong balls. They were bouncing.''   I-880 was built in 1957 and was reinforced in 1977 in the firstpart of a three-phase anti-earthquake program, Department ofTransportation officials said. In the work, the road deck was tiedto its supporting columns.   The columns themselves collapsed, and the deck did not slip offthe columns, transportation department chief engineer Bill Schaefersaid in Sacramento.   Further work to strengthen the road against earthquakes had beendeferred pending an engineering study, Schaefer said.   Asked whether the freeway had been considered safe fromearthquakes, Schaefer said, ``there's no such thing as anearthquake-proof structure,'' but added he was shocked by thecollapse.   ``We thought it would withstand the maximum credible earthquakewe could have in this area, anything that would happen in thisarea,'' he told reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
