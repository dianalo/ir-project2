That did not turnout to be the case this time.   Stocks held up while the U.S. bond market fell steeply andforeign stock markets showed widespread weakness.   Stock indexes Monday fell 1.8 percent in Tokyo, 3.2 percent inLondon and a steep 12.8 percent in Frankfurt, West Germany, whereone trader described trading as a ``blood bath.''   The dollar's value tracked the stock market and was mixedagainst major currencies.   Traders said the stock market benefited from the experiencegained in the 1987 crash. The New York Stock Exchange managed tohandle the heavy trading volume because of a big investment intechnology made after the crash.   In addition, traders were soothed by a promise over the weekendby the Federal Reserve to supply fresh money to the financialsystem if necessary to make sure banks kept loans flowing totraders who lost money.   It turned out that little action by the Fed was necessary. As aprecaution, the central bank injected about $2 billion into thefinancial system on a day when it ordinarily would have drainedreserves.   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announcedhe was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent ofAmerican Airlines, after the company's stock fell in the broadmarket plunge. He said he would consider a new offer at a lowerprice.   It was a failure to obtain financing for an employee-managementbuyout of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that sparked Friday'splunge. A spokesman for British Airways PLC, which is backing thebuyout group, said the group still planned to pursue a takeover,although the terms of the deal were under review.   There were communications all day Monday between the stockexchanges, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and ExchangeCommission, New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard Torrenzanosaid.</TEXT></DOC>
