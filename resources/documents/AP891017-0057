Ronald Rosen, Newman's attorney, said the actor signed withHBO's subsidiary, Time-Life Productions, to make the 1980 filmabout a veteran policeman in New York City.   The suit filed Monday in federal court alleges breach ofcontract and antitrust violations. It seeks $5 million in punitivedamages and $450,000 in alleged lost fees to the actor. It alsoseeks an injunction against further ``block-booking'' of ``FortApache.''   Newman was to receive 15 percent of domestic gross receipts and12.5 percent of overseas earnings under the contract, Rosen said.   In 1985, Time-Life Productions licensed ``Fort Apache'' and 192other films to Procter andamp; Gamble Co. for $50 million, Rosen said.   The rental fee charged Pandamp;G for ``Fort Apache'' was $1 million,he said, arguing HBO used the film to coerce Pandamp;G into taking theother films, a violation of antitrust laws. Newman maintained thefilm's true value through licensing was $4 million.   ``HBO compelled Pandamp;G to artificially allocate a lower license feeto the film than was economically justified, and artificiallyallocated higher license fees to the other 192 motion pictures inthe group,'' Rosen said.   A call to HBO's New York offices made after business hoursMonday went unanswered.</TEXT></DOC>
