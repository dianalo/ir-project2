The Seattle-based concern, which halted trading of its stock yesterday on the Pacific Stock Exchange pending the announcement, wouldn't elaborate. But analysts at several brokerages yesterday speculated that Burlington, with interests in rail, timber, coal, natural gas and real estate, might indeed jettison some assets that haven't been star performers.    &quot;There's no question that they have a lot of under-earning assets that would make them a restructuring candidate,&quot; said Craig Schwerdt, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner Inc., Los Angeles.    Some analysts asserted that Burlington might sell off certain oil and gas properties, like the company's El Paso Natural Gas Co. unit, a major natural-gas pipeline in the Southwest, or its Meridian Oil Co. subsidiary, an independent oil and gas producer.    In addition to owning and operating 25,500 miles of railroad, Burlington owns about 2.5 million acres of real estate, some of it rich timber land, as well as vast coal reserves.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Burlington closed at $67.375 a share, up $2.375, on volume of 662,100 shares, more than double the average daily number of Burlington shares traded.    Speculation centering on Burlington's real estate and energy holdings has moved the stock recently. On March 23, Burlington's shares were trading at $72.625, but they fell to $57.875 May 23 before beginning to climb again.    Analysts said the company has hinted in the recent past at taking some sort of action. John Kawa, a railroad and energy analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report last week that &quot;speculation from a reliable source&quot; indicated that Burlington's chief executive officer, R.M. Bressler, who is scheduled for retirement in 1990, &quot;might want to go out with a bang.&quot;    Burlington's breakup value has been put at $100 a share to $110 a share by analysts. Gary Yablon, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., estimated that the railroad has a value of $50 a share to $55 a share, and the company's energy assets $60 a share to $65 a share. Mr. Yablon also estimated forest products have a value of $12 a share to $12.50 a share, and natural resources, mostly land, $8.50 a share to $12.50 a share.    But now may be a bad time to sell off any of Burlington's assets. Only the company's railroad operations, boosted by higher volume and improved freight rates, reported an increase in operating income for the first quarter to $152 million, compared with $109 million a year earlier. Operating income from its interstate pipeline operations fell to $67 million from $75 million for the quarter. Operating income for its oil and gas operations declined to $26 million from $31 million a year ago, and forest products operating income declined to $17 million from $23 million.    For the quarter, the company had net income of $91.5 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with $69.4 million, or 93 cents a share. Revenue jumped to $1.86 billion from $1.65 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
