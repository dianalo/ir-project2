 It struckacademic, military and commercial scientific research sites,consuming memory and causing machines to grind to a halt.andP;  Manycomputer security experts argue that RTM should not be punished,but many worry about the social implications of computer security:more and more systems will require cumbersome 'locks' which willmake it difficult for legitimate users to access information.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer virusesBiographyComputer CrimesWide Area Networks.andO;Person:    Morris, Robert T., Jr. (cases).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Shockwave Rider &quot;ONCE YOU RELEASED this worm, did you have any ability tocontrol it?&quot;andP;  the defense attorney asked the defendant.andM;&quot;No.andP;  Once I released it, I had essentially no contact with it at all.andP;  Icouldn't control it,&quot; said the young man, facing the jury inthe Syracuse, NewYork, courtroom.andP;  &quot;After it started, it was pretty much doing its own thing.&quot;andM;Robert Tappan Morris, the creator of the Internet computer worm, patientlytold the courtroom packed with TV and newspaper reporters how his secretexperiment had gone terribly awry.andM;In the front row of the courtroom sat a slender man holding a copy of Livy'sHistory of Rome.andP;  The man's suit was worn, his shoes untied, his gray beardunkempt.andP;  But he just happened to be an internationally known computersecurity expert, master cryptographer, and the National Security Agency's topcomputer scientist.andP;  His name: Robert Morris, Sr.andM;&quot;It was a mistake, and I am sorry for it,&quot; said the younger Morris, hislarge, watery eyes focused on the jury.andP;  Minutes later, at the lunch break,the prosecutor wlaked past the defendant, and the young hacker couldn'tsuppress a smile.andP;  His soft, pale checks seemed to rise into a smirk.andP;  Was hegiggling?andM;&quot;The work of a bored graduate student,&quot; was Morris senior's explanation toThe New york Times after his son released the most virulent worm the worldhad ever seen.andP;  Indeed, the younger Morris did seem bored at Cornell, wherehe was only a few weeks into his graduate studies.andP;  Two weeks before theworm's release, Peter McIlroy, a childhood friend, had visited Morris.andP;  &quot;Heliked some classes and not others,&quot; McIlroy remembers.andP;  &quot;Some he seemed to beblowing off.&quot;andM;But Morris seemed to be getting along in Ithaca.andP;  He had taken torock-climbing and was playing intramural hockey.andP;  &quot;There was no inkling hewas about to write a computer worm,&quot; recalls his friend.andP;  Except, perhaps,for one clue.andP;  McIlroy, also a techie, had casually mentioned to his friendthat he believed the Unix operating system was pretty secure.andM;&quot;No!andP;  It's unbelievably insecure!&quot;andP;  Morris snapped.andP;  &quot;It's unbelievable howmany holes there are!&quot;andM;McIlroy was caught off-guard by Morris's fervor.andP;  &quot;It bothered and surprisedhim that the holes would never get fixed.&quot;andM;Was it as simple as that?andP;  Bored by his courses, had the son of the nation'sleading computer security expert taken things into his own hands?andP;  Had the&quot;attack&quot; merely been a well-intended but bungled attempt to shore up computersecurity and teach the world a valuable, relatively safe lesson?andM;Theories on the worm and its author's motivations consume several chapters ofpopular books and countless articles.andP;  Some have hypothesized that the wormwas a high-tech, father-son spat played out on a global scale, while one bookblithely concluded that father and son had jointly launched the attack underthe auspices of the National Security Agency.andM;Hackers saw a broader political motivation.andP;  The trial of Robert Morrisbecame the trial of an entire generation and philosophy of computers andinformation.andP;  To many hackers, Morris became a freedom fighter, a symbol ofelectronic free speech, a voice against the power that centralized computerswield over individuals.andM;But more than a few hackers wondered if the coup was misguided, if Morris wasnot placing at risk the very freedom of information that his supportersangrily demanded.andM;At the center of the debate stood two elite hackers, the very sort of wizardswe have come to expect to guard us against computer saboteurs.andP;  But that wasbefore Morris stepped over the line and plunged into a digital no-man's land.andM;Under provisions of the untested 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, RobertTappan Morris, Jr., was indicted for trespass.andP;  His offense?andP;  Unauthorizedcomputer access.andM;THE STORY OF ROBERT TAPPAN MORRIS begins with his father and the hauntinglypowerful electronic world he helped to create.andP;  In the early 1970s, when BellLaboratories began designing the universal operating system called Unix, itwas Morris senior who imbued the virgin software with security.andM;&quot;The scheme for encrypting passwords was very heavily influenced by him, theinterest in low-grade cryptography--the things we think of as absolutelyroutine,&quot; says Douglas McIlroy, Peter's father and one of the designers ofUnix at Bell Labs' Murray Hill, New Jersey, facility.andP;  The elder Morrishelped bar snoopers by making it difficult for anyone to become a &quot;superuser&quot;--a person with the power to use or abuse a system.andM;&quot;There was this constant game of trying to figure out how to circumvent thebest security measures we had,&quot; McIlroy recalls.andP;  &quot;You had to be able toout-think the most devious minds.&quot;andM;That was the dilemma Morris senior faced: to protect, he had to know how todestroy.andM;Morris senior often seemed locked in an elusive battle with the equallybrilliant and eccentric Ken Thompson, a legend in the computer industry andwidely respected as one of the inventors of Unix.andP;  &quot;Each would try to outdothe other in a friendly, but mean-spirited, way,&quot; McIlroy says.andM;Morris thrived in the daily skirmishes.andP;  One of the cryptic scientist's mostrevealing feats occurred during tests on the first working copy of the Multixoperating system.andP;  He walked into the laboratory and typed twocharacters--two specific characters he had a hunch the system could notcompute.andP;  The machine crashed.andP;  &quot;It was dramatic,&quot; says McIlroy.andP;  &quot;He alwaysliked to put on an air of mystery.&quot;andM;First Bell and then other companies invited Morris to break into theircomputer centers to test their defenses.andP;  Hired by one defense contractor todiscover its computer system's Achilles' heel, Morris dressed himself as asecurity guard, walked in, and watched someone type a password.andP;  While thistactic was an exception (Morris usually broke systems with his encyclopedicknowledge of encryption, cryptography, and computer security), itdemonstrated his dramatic side.andP;  &quot;Bob had a certain amount of falir,&quot; recallsMcIlroy.andP;  &quot;He definitely enjoyed his prowess.&quot;andM;By the 1980s, the chain-smoking, shabbily dressed scientist had developedinto a master cryptographer and a world expert in protecting electronicinformation.andP;  He designed a Navy computer that tracked enemy submarines byspotting anomalies in the masses of data gleaned by ocean sensors.andP;  At thetime it was the world's largest computer.andM;Morris senior's stage broadened in 1986, when he became the chief scientistat the National Computer Security Center of the National Security Agency andassumed responsibility for protecting sensitive computer-based dataworldwide.andP;  Friends reported that he dove into the mysterious intelligenceunderworld with a passion.andP;  His office was outfitted with a &quot;Tempest&quot;computer, encased in lead to prevent the interception of radio emissions, andvisitors say his blackboard was covered with Russian words.andM;Years later, in the tumultuous days following the Internet attack, Morrissenior's sense of mystery and drama had not waned.andP;  Newspaper and TVreporters camped in front of his new home in Arnold, Maryland.andP;  Inside, hisson was quiet, talking little even to his Harvard buddies who had driventhrough the night to support their friend.andM;It was his father who spoke to the press, telling The New York Times, &quot;I knowa few dozen people in the country who could have [created the worm].andP;  I couldhave done it, but I'm a darned good programmer.&quot;andP;  Perhaps it was notsurprising that after the press left, Morris senior placed the puzzling deedin historical focus.andP;  &quot;Let's find out where this all started,&quot; he said to hisson's friends, pulling down a book by John Brunner titled The ShockwaveRider.andM;In a scholarly tone, Morris senior explained that the 1976 science fictionclassic, one of his son's favorites, popularized the idea of computer worms.andO;What he didn't explain was that the book's protagonis was remarkably similarto himself.andP;  And to his son.andP;  Like both Morrises, the Shockwave Rideroutsmarted computer security measures with the cunning of a secret agent and,like Robert Morris, Jr., the Schockwave Rider was forced by his genius tomake a difficult, controversial decision.andP;  Having spent his youth expandinghis computer powers, the Shockwave Rider pondered the true test of wisdom:andM;&quot;What a wise man can do, that can't be done by someone who's merely clever,is make a right judgment in an unprecedented situation.&quot;andM;YOUNG MORRIS MAY HAVE BEEN CHARGED with the crime of the future, but he grewup in a world closer to the last century than the next.andP;  The Morris familylived in a 250-year-old farmhouse on nine rambling acres of spruce, pine, andswamp alongside the Passaic River near the quaint town of Millington, NewJersey.andP;  The children cared for the farm animals and Robert tended thefamily's sheep.andM;&quot;They wanted to keep the old ways,&quot; recalls the current owner of the house.andO;&quot;They lived very simply.andP;  They didn't have material things.&quot;andP;  The family grewvegetables in a 50-by-100-foot garden, and if they needed something more thanthe earth and animals could supply, Morris senior would bring home a cast-offto salvage, like the giant-size freezer he repaired to store their freshlyslaughtered meat.andP;  The family cut firewood for themselves and in winterdragged it by sleds over the ice-bound river.andM;There was something untamed about the Morris clan.andP;  &quot;I don't think theMorrises even knew how many cats they had,&quot; recalls a friend, who says 20 ormore cats roamed the property while three or four big furry black dogs ruledthe hearth.andM;Inside the old farmhouse, unnecessary elements were eliminated.andP;  A mantleconsidered &quot;too ornamental&quot; was hacked out, a closet was torn out to squeezein yet another bookcase, and a bathroom was ripped out to create anotherbedroom.andP;  The ceiling sagged and the plaster was cracked, but the&quot;unbelievable mess,&quot; as a friend calls it, held an unusual collection ofquirky wartime coding devices, including the mysterious Nazi Enigma machine.andM;Named from the Greek word for puzzle, the Enigma was a mesh of gears androtors that controlled an electronic drum rimmed by the letters of thealphabet and fed by a typewriter.andP;  Considered a foolproof scrambler, thebattery-powered Enigma served as the Third Reich's top coder in World War II.andO;But in 1939, an elite British team of cryptanalysts and mathematicianscracked the coder and gained a tremendous edge over Hitler's forcesthroughout the war.andP;  With the Enigma's secrets unlocked, the Alliedcommanders could read the Fuhrer's orders often before his own generalsreceived them.andM;Almost everything at the Morris house had a story behind it, no matter howobscure it might appear.andP;  The house was overflowing with puzzle sculpturepieces, magazines, and more books than you'd find in most small libraries.andO;And not just any books.andP;  Morris senior had been a brilliant mathematician atHarvard, but he also loved the classics and learned to read Greek and Latin.andO;His wife, Anne Morris, counted the vast family collection one day and, aftertossing out duplicates, logged 7,000 volumes.andM;Morris junior began reading at the age of four.andP;  The curious toddler createdworkig scale models out of paper, file folders, and paper clips--cars withwheels that turned when you moved the steering wheel and revolvers withbullets and chambers that turned.andP;  At nine he read stacks of ScientificAmerican.andP;  His father had a ham radio license, and before long the boy beganassembling and disassembling radios and a variety of other electronicequipment.andP;  By the time he reached his early teens, his reading list hadexpanded to include the classics, history, economics, political sciencie, andscience fiction.andM;But downstairs, in the old kitchen, in front of an unused Dutch oven, was amachine like no other.andP;  From a distance, it looked like a huge mechanicaltypewriter stretched over a desk, but what were those protruding rods andcables?andP;  The strange-looking device, which had been in the house since themid-1960s, when Morris junior was born, was a computer terminal.andM;As a top scientist at Bell Labs, Morris senior was one of a few employeeswith a home computer terminal during an era when electric typewriters werestill rare.andP;  &quot;Everybody lined up behind one another to get their computertime,&quot; recalls Anne Morris of the Digital Equipment terminal.andP;  But herchildren were not all alike.andP;  Soon her daughter lost interest, and theyounger boy rebelled.andP;  (He now works as a tree surgeon.)andM;Only Robert, the older boy, remained captivated by the clanking, screenlessterminal.andP;  Each time he struck a key on the machine, mechanical rods shiftedlike the trackers of a pipe organ, forming the eight bits thatr made theirway over the terminal's modem to Bell's central computer.andP;  Frequentlubrication was needed to keep the machine's rods from sticking, and after along session, Robert would often emerge with oily knees.andM;When Peter McIlroy visited the Morris farmhouse, he noticed his friend wasn'tmerely playing the computer's math and guessing games.andP;  &quot;By the sixth grade,he was finding holes [in the operating system],&quot; recalls McIlroy.andP;  &quot;But hewasn't a snoop.andP;  It was much more of an intellectual game.&quot;andM;Not yet in his teens, Morris junior already knew his way around the huge,complex Unix operating system.andP;  He created multiuser games to chat with hisfriends simultaneously and a surprisingly sophisticated Unix interface shell.andO;The Unix code was online, and nearly every day after school Robert studied itthe way other boys studied girls.andP;  His girlfriend, the daughter of anotherBell employee, was online, and the budding hacker zapped love notes to her.andM;By his mid-teens, the young Morris showed Peter McIlroy how, by logging on toone terminal, he could masquerade as a legitimate user on any computer inBell's network.andP;  &quot;He found it, played with it, and fixed it,&quot; says McIlroy.andO;&quot;I think they [Bell officials] were impressed.&quot;andP;  Bell officials say thatwhile Morris did modify some files, no serious damage was done.andP;  &quot;He was toldto stop and that was that,&quot; says Bell's Fred Grampp.andM;But Morris was allowed to visit his father's office and continue his poking,and in December 1982, Grampp invited him to give a talk about tighteningsecurity on a Unix communications program.andP;  Soon Morris was working part-timeat the lab after school and full-time for the next two summers, writing hisfirst scientific paper, &quot;A Security Flaw in Berkeley .andP;  .  .  Unix,&quot; inJanuary 1983.andM;His initiation into the rites of super-hacking couldn't have been more pure.andO;In the elite, challenging research environment of Bell Labs, the teenagerlearned &quot;to spot and repair security holes&quot; at the feet of the very peoplewho had created Unix.andM;But Morris was far from a one-dimensional, stereotypical hacker.andP;  At nearbyDelbarton, a preparatory school run by Benedictine monks, he excelled in abroad range of courses, swam the breaststroke on the school swim team, sangwith the abbey's chorus, and was, according to the Delbarton credo,&quot;encouraged to become an independent seeker of information and takeresponsibility for gaining both knowledge and judgment.&quot;andM;Yet years later, his parents proudly announced that it was he who wasfeatured in a 1982 Smithsonian magazine article as a &quot;quiet, polite youngman&quot; who &quot;has broken into password files&quot; and read &quot;supposedly private&quot;computer mail.andP;  &quot;I never told myself that there was nothing wrong with what Iwas doing,&quot; the boy was quoted as saying, adding that he was driven by thechallenge of testing computer security.andP;  It was a family preoccupation thatMorris shared with his fictional double, the shockwave Rider:andM;&quot;I guess my daddy was a 'phone phreak' and I inherited the gene.&quot;andM;The following year, Morris senior wrote in his 25th anniversary Harvardreport: &quot;I promised myself that I would learn to read Greek, learn in somedetail how the planets move in their orbits, and learn how to decipher secretcodes.andP;  I have gone a long way toward keeping all three promises.&quot;andP;  But itwas secret codes--not Greek or the heavens--that captivated his teenage son,and he was soon fast at work on his first paid computer security project atBell.andM;The security crusade didn't end at the laboratory.andP;  At the farmhouse, fatherand son oftern discussed Unix and computer security.andP;  &quot;I'm very sure he gothints from his father,&quot; says Douglas McUlroy, &quot;but I doubt he got muchdetailed help.andP;  I think his father wanted to generate self-reliance.&quot;andP;  Theyoung Morris told a friend that his father created games to develop hisprogramming skills, nce even making him program without GOTOcommands--something like playing basketball with only your left hand.andP;  &quot;Hisfather was always challenging him,&quot; recalls Roy Horton, Morris junior's musicteacher and a close family friend.andP;  &quot;They were of similar minds.&quot;andM;The next year Morris senior and Grampp wrote and, with some trepidation,published the definitive paper on Unix security.andP;  In the footnotes was areference to Morris junior's paper, and in the introduction, a warning:&quot;There is a fine line between helping administrators protect their systemsand providing a cookbook for bad guys.&quot;andM;Morris junior seemed to understand the dangers.andP;  In his second publishedscientific paper, he sounded every bit the seasoned computer security expert.andO;&quot;The old uucp [Unix to Unix copy procedure] was designed on small machineswith light traffic and little concern for security,&quot; wrote the confident18-year-old.andP;  &quot;Times have changed.andP;  With many hundreds of machines runninguucp, one cannot assume that no uucp requests will be malicious.&quot;andM;&quot;AREN'T YOU THIS FAMOUS, GREAT HACKER?&quot; asked an impressionable fellowHarvard student.andP;  &quot;No,&quot; said Morris, his boyish face betraying embarrassmentand a slight smile.andP;  &quot;That's my roommate.&quot;andM;Morris continued the playful deception for several minutes.andP;  The ShockwaveRider, too, had many identities, many lives woven through the electronic net:andM;&quot;An individual could rewrite him or herself via any terminal connected to thefederal data banks .andP;  .  .  this was the most precious of all freedoms .andP;  . andO;.  freedom to become the person you chose to be instead of the personremembered by the computers .andP;  .  .  it was the enchanted sword, theinvulnerable shield, the winged boots, the cloak of invisibility.andP;  It was theultimate defense.&quot;andM;Morris had several identities at Harvard.andP;  The story goes that as a freshmanhe walked in, brought down the system, and hacked his first identity, anunauthorized Harvard account.andP;  Whether that initial act of mastery be myth orfact, in a matter of months Morris had hacked and cultivated a fistful ofcomputer credit accounts.andP;  His log-on name became his identity, both onlineand among his friends: RTM.andM;As a freshman, RTM began hanging around Harvard's graduate computer sciencedepartment, Aiken Lab, an ugly slab of concrete built in the 1940s and namedafter one of the inventors of the modern computer.andP;  It was here, behind aglass wall, opposite the antiquated vacuum-tube computer, that RTM spent mostof his waking hours.andM;&quot;He'd fix things for free,&quot; recalls Paul Graham, a computer science graduatestudent and close friend.andP;  &quot;There was no question that he was the mosttechnical person.&quot;andM;RTM's breadth of knowledge was exceptional: Unix, networking, hardware,graphics, and several other languages.andP;  Andrew Sudduth, Aiken's systemmanager, hired RTM, and like many who employed him on campus, Sudduth foundthat RTM was too busy chasing the latest computer problem to punch a timeclock or do his class work.andP;  &quot;A professor would say, 'Wouldn't it be nice ifwe had this?'&quot; he recalls.andP;  &quot;And Robert would go and do it.&quot;andM;He began by pacing the halls.andP;  There was no evidence he was working on theproblem.andP;  After sufficient gestation, he settled in at a terminal, preferably&quot;a lousy one,&quot; with a black and white display, a throwback, says Graham, tohis days on his father's mechanical, screenless terminal.andP;  There were nodistractions, no interruptions, and once he began, the pace was fierce, forTRM could program as fast as he could type.andM;Rail-thin, RTM ate little, and when classmates invited him to lunch, twohours later he would still be hunched over his keyboard, typing furiously.andO;Friends would stand over him, calling out his name, but the transfixedprogrammer seemed to hear nothing.andP;  When a few nights of intense programmingfinally gelled, RTM would snap out of his spell.andP;  &quot;He would jump up and rubhis hands when he figured something out,&quot; says Sudduth.andM;Not all of his achievements were altruistic.andP;  RTM could do &quot;anything hewanted&quot; when friends were logged on to a Sun workstation, according to Grahamand others.andP;  One of his most playful pranks was creating a subliminal messagethat would flash for less than half a second on the screen of an unsuspectinguser.andP;  Graham said he saw the fleeting message, &quot;Help, I'm being heldprisoner within a VAX 750!&quot; and then wondered if he'd imagined it all.andM;Occasionally RTM took the game further, demanding a response to his whimsicalintrusions.andP;  Classmates sometimes found their work interrupted by a sagecalled The ORacle.andP;  &quot;Ask me a question and I will answer you,&quot; asked RTM, TheOracle.andP;  &quot;But first you must answer me.&quot;andM;Some of his pranks tested a user's technical knowledge.andP;  On a lark, RMreverse-engineered the Harvard network into an older, defunct interface.andO;Everything worked, but the commands were different, and &quot;true&quot; hackers seemedto enjoy the challenge.andP;  Roommate Greg Kuperberg, a nationally ranked collegemathemaician (also prone to feverish pacing) who befriended RTM andcollaborated with him on an elaborate graphics program, says his friend'sforays into Harvard's computers were exagerrated and misunderstood.andP;  RTM wassimply inquisitive, says Kuperberg, and his experiments were not muchdifferent from those of a young chemist who occasionally mixed the wrongchemicals.andM;But RTM's experiments were not without side effects, and there were some whodidn't consider it good, clean fun.andP;  One night, Robert Ziff, a Harvardengineering student, watched the program he was working on slow to a snail'space.andP;  He complained to the deparmtent's system manager, who checked to seewho was tying up the computer's resources and exclaimed, &quot;Oh God!andP;  It'sRobert Morris.&quot;andM;RTM had programs simultaneously running off his accounts on the engineeringand robotics computers--in addition to Aiken's.andP;  It wasn't the first time hehad &quot;hogged&quot; computer time.andP;  Ziff was instructed to warn RTM that &quot;if ithappens again, they'll take you off the account.&quot;andM;Ziff was by no means the only one at Harvard who was unhappy with RTM and hisexperiments.andP;  A few were &quot;mistrustful of Robert because he was smarter andbetter,&quot; says a friend.andP;  To those individuals, RTM sometimes sent commandsthat mysteriously crept onto their computer screens.andP;  There was never anydoubt who had sent the ominous commands.andP;  Only RTM knew the secret securityholes.andP;  And there was never any doubt that he would keep his dark knowledgesecret.andP;  &quot;He wouldn't tell them how he did it,&quot; says the friend.andP;  &quot;He didn'ttrust them.&quot;andP;  Instead, RTM left his enemies hanging, wondering whether hemight just decide to execute the REMOVE FILE commands he dangled on theirscreens.andP;  &quot;I did in fact break into other people's computers [at Harvard],&quot;Morris later admitted in court, &quot;but I ...andP;  knew that they wouldn't mind.&quot;andM;In one sense, RTM was no different from other hackers.andP;  The first commandmentof hacking is to not waste computer time, to push and pull every electron'sworth of processing might.andP;  It is a boy's pursuit, a masculine display ofvirtuosity.andP;  Test pilots call it &quot;pushing the envelope.&quot;andP;  No longer protectedby his father or the understanding researchers at Bell Labs, RTM begantesting his wings, and, like the Shockwave Rider, he thrived in his newenvironment:andM;&quot;Meantime, taking advantage of the corporation's status, he could gain accessto data nets that were ordinarily secure.andP;  That was the whole point of comingto KC.andP;  He wanted--more, he needed--data...&quot;andM;RTM never did carry out the ominous threats, and at the same time he wasbuilding professional credentials as a dedicated computer security expert.andM;&quot;The Unix software is very flexible and convenient, but it places too muchtrust in a protocol that provides very little security,&quot; he warned in a 1985Bell Labs paper that described how to attack &quot;trusting&quot; host on the vastnational computer network known as Internet.andM;Two years later, while still at Harvard, RTM delivered several long talks onhis extensive knowledge of computer security at the National Computer ScienceSecurity Center and the Naval Research Lab.andP;  During his summers he hacked forcomputer companies on both coasts.andM;As he became more technically accomplished, his two personas--the mischievousRTM and the dedicated computer security expert, Robert Morris, Jr.--struck anuneasy balance.andP;  The same friends who detail how RTM inspired fear in hisenemies remember him as a person who believed in the importance of&quot;character&quot; and who hacked out favors at a moment's notice.andM;But in his professional role, Morris increasingly found that the real worldwas not nearly as responsive to security concerns as the Bell Laboratories ofhis childhood.andP;  he discovered that if he reported a security bug, companiesoften did nothing, or they waited for months before issuing patches.andP;  Heworried that unscrupulous hackers would take advantage of his discoveries.andO;He began to keep the secret openings to himself.andM;When RTM was taking graduate mathematics and computer science courses in1985, the combination of his freelance projects, his generosity, and the&quot;difficulty and the boredom&quot; of graduate work became too much for him.andP;  RTMdid not excel in every course, as his father had.andP;  So he dropped out and wentto work at the Convex Computer Corporation, in Richardson, Texas.andM;The young hacker's education began to have more in common with that of theShockwave Rider:andM;&quot;Shortly thereafter, he began to concentrate on data processing techniques atthe expense of his other study subjects.&quot;andM;The following year, Morris junior returned to his Harvard studies eager tolearn.andP;  Friends remember his pacing about their homes or apartments, pickingup things to see how they worked.andP;  Often his excitement bubbled over.andP;  &quot;Hewas always breaking things,&quot; says Graham.andP;  &quot;And he was insatiably curious.&quot;andM;The love of the classics his father had inspired had not diminished.andP;  &quot;Hemight be interested in medieval art, English history (a poster of Englishkings adorned his dorm room), Homer, the Renaissance, or Greek art,&quot; recallsa Harvard classics professor RTM helped with some computing problems.andP;  &quot;Hisknowledge was pretty encyclopedic.&quot;andP;  But the serious topics didn't keep theHarvard student from classic adventure stories like the Norse sagas and oneof his favorites, The Three Musketeers.andM;Something of an adventurer himself, RTM and a classmate spent a week buyingcopies of The Racing Form at six in the morning and entering &quot;tons of dataabout correlations of past performances.&quot;andP;  Then the budding computer bookiestook in their first horse race at nearby Suffolk Downs.andP;  &quot;It was sodepressing,&quot; says RTM's friend about the crowd of retired, alcoholicpensioners.andP;  Deciding it &quot;criminal&quot; to beat such sorry bettors, the twoabandoned their get-rich-quick scheme.andM;Computer graphics became a new infatuation.andP;  With Kuperberg, RTM created anadvanced ray-tracing graphics program.andP;  When he found that higher mathematicswere not enough to create beautiful forms, he turned to the ancients,studying the works of Vitruvius, the inventor of proportion standards forclassical columns.andP;  One of RTM's finest creations was of a temple standing inthe middle of a blue sea.andM;Excited by their success, the talented duo entertained the idea of launchinga computer graphics firm.andP;  &quot;We had this picture of a kid running a lemonadestand who one day turned into Donald Trump,&quot; says Kuperberg, who, like hisfriend, had a &quot;default plan&quot; of graduate school.andM;BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH.andP;  It was the way RTM entertained an idea, asif by the movement of his light steps he might nudge the completed thoughtfrom his brain.andP;  But this time he seemed more driven than usual.andM;He had come the nearly 300 miles from his graduate computer science studiesat Cornell to pore over the Unix source code at Harvard's Aiken Lab and visithis friend, Paul Graham.andP;  &quot;He had discovered a big hole and he had to tellsomeone,&quot; recalls Graham.andP;  Excitedly, RTM paced the small office, tellingGraham how he had isolated holes in Unix that could enable him to be a superuser--not at Cornell or Harvard, but across the country and around the world.andO;Both of the bugs were communications holes, but RTM explained how the FTP(File Transfer Protocol) bug could conceivably grant an invader rootprivileges--the ability to read or delete anything on a compromised machine.andM;&quot;It was an experiment,&quot; Morris later testified.andP;  &quot;I had never heard ofanything like it before ...andP;  to see if I could write a program that wouldspread as widely as possible in Internet.&quot;andP;  His friend was similarlyentranced.andP;  &quot;I thought it was the greatest idea,&quot; says Graham, &quot;All over theworld.andP;  A big living organism.andP;  No one had ever done it before.&quot;andP;  Of course,it had been done before by the Shockwave Rider:andM;&quot;This is indeed the father and mother of a tapeworm.andP;  You'll have noticed howmuch use it makes of terminology derived from the study of living animals.andO;And with reason.andP;  Not for nothing is a tapeworm called a tapeworm.andP;  It can bemade to breed ...andP;  my newest--my masterpiece--breeds by itself.&quot;andM;To Graham, the worm was not only an incredible creation, it was a bold strikefor freedom, and later in court he would compare RTM to Mathias Rust, theWest German pilot who landed in Moscow's Red Square in May 1987.andP;  Encouragedby his starry-eyed friend, RTM paced, describing how he wanted every computeron the Internet to receive one innocuous probe, one worm that would wriggleits way into each computer's memory.andM;Finally, the excitement grew too great for Morris.andM;&quot;RTM, you're on his desk,&quot; said Graham, as he watched RTM's feet pad by ontop of their colleague's desk.andM;&quot;Oh,&quot; said RTM, for the first time aware of his rise in elevation.andP;  Thisbehavior was typical of Morris when he was absorbed in thought.andM;Later, on that cool October night in 1988, RTM and Graham continued talkingabout the probe as they stood in front of a Boston seafood restaurant waitingfor Sudduth, a champion rower, whom they would toast as a winner of theannual Head of the Charles regatta.andP;  As they waited, Graham suggested thatthe worm write something to the computers it wriggled its way into.andM;&quot;No, no, we can't do writes,&quot; his friend said, explaining that any writes, nomatter how well-intended, might be dangerous.andM;What the two couldn't figure out was how to protect a single worm on eachmachine.andP;  &quot;It would have been very simple for someone to write a program thatjust acted as if it was a worm [an antiworm],&quot; tricking new worms intobelieving a computer had already been penetrated and stopping &quot;my worm fromgrowing at all,&quot; Morris testified.andP;  And so, he decided it might be all rightto have two, or maybe three, worms per machine.andM;But neither knew much about population growth, and if RTM had any technicalshortcoming, it was his ambivalence toward higher mathematics.andP;  There on thesidewalk, the two decided that the second worm to invade a machine shouldhave a one-in-seven rate of survival.andM;No particular formula was used, Morris later told a jury.andP;  &quot;It was based onthe intuition I had on how rapidly it would spread.&quot;andP;  He figured a new wormmight appear once every few hours.andP;  As the Shockwave Rider explained,everything was under control:andM;&quot;And, no, it can't be killed.andP;  It's indefinitely self-perpetuating so long asthe net exists ...andP;  incidentally, though, it won't expand to indefinite sizeand clog the net for other use.andP;  It has built-in limits.&quot;andM;When Sudduth arrived at the restaurant, the two collaborators abruptlychanged the subject.andP;  &quot;When we were on a project,&quot; says Graham, &quot;it wasunderstood that it was secret.&quot;andP;  But RTM couldn't keep everything under hishat.andP;  Without hinting that he planned an attack, he excitedly told Sudduthabout the bugs he had uncovered.andM;And at first, in the ensuing days, it seemed that RTM's wild idea might gothe way of his racetrack betting and computer graphics schemes.andP;  For severaldays after RTM had returned to Cornell, Graham heard nothing from his friend.andM;The two had an old practice of sending elliptical messages over Internet--forsecurity's sake.andP;  &quot;Any news on the brilliant project?&quot;andP;  Graham asked in hiselectronic message.andM;There was no response.andM;RTM HAD BEEN BUSY.andP;  More than a week before his visit to Harvard, he hadcreated a wish list for his worm on his university computer.andP;  It wasstrangely appropriate that he began the work at Cornell.andP;  Officials wouldlater say it was his reputation as a hacker that gained him admittance to theuniversity's prestigious graduate school in computer science.andM;RTM's list was divided into the two main goals he had for his worm: attackand defense.andP;  The target was Internet, an umbrella of three nationalcommunication networks, including ARPAnet, run by the Department of Defenseto link research computers at military sites and universities; MILnet, usedby military and civilian researchers to send routine, unclassifiedcommunications; and NSFnet, a National Science Foundation network.andM;In the beginning, RTM and Graham used the popular term virus to describe theworm, but as the creation took shape it came to resemble the prehistoricworm.andP;  Viruses exist by invading and altering their host cells, and theircomputer counterparts are similar.andP;  They cannot &quot;live&quot; or run withoutattaching themselves to other programs.andP;  But a computer worm is independent.andO;Self-propagating and self-running, worms can exist without directlyendangering a network or its users.andP;  Some early computer worms were actuallyloosed to perform network management tasks.andP;  The Shockwave Rider's worm had ahigher social and moral goal:andM;&quot;The primary my worm is designed to invade is that privacy under whose coverjustice is not done and injustice is not seen.&quot;andM;RTM designed his worm to clone itself, spreading throughout the net.andO;Searching out new nesting locations, the worm scanned address lists ofcomputers, selecting the most directly linked machines, such as gateways, andthen began cycling through its attacks.andP;  If one method failed, the tirelessinvader quickly picked another from its arsenal.andP;  The attacks fell into threecategories: nooking a foothold through a security hole, taking advantage of&quot;trusting&quot; computers, and cracking passwords.andP;  RTM playfully named his worm'sattack engine the &quot;cracksome&quot; routine.andM;Footholds could be gained through either of two techniques.andP;  One involved autility designed to elicit such information as a user's full name, office,and phone number.andP;  It was fittingly named Fingered.andP;  The worm overflowed theprogram's small buffer and tricked unsuspecting machines into downloading,compiling, and running a tiny source code &quot;grappling hook&quot;--the worm's scout.andM;Once ensconced within the target computer, the hook called the original wormand &quot;pulled&quot; back sections of a new version of the original worm compiled torun on either a VAX or a Sun workstation, the two most common computers onthe network (if the hook guessed wrong, it pulled over the other version).andO;Finally, the hook linked the sections together and the new worm beganrunning.andM;By compiling his worm for the two machines in advance, RTM avoided the riskof sending an easily decipherable source code copy of the program.andP;  Only thetiny &quot;grappling hook&quot; was written in source code, to ensure that the firstcast would draw a bite.andP;  The drawback, of course, was that the worm couldsuccessfully invade only VAX or Sun workstations.andM;A similar attack was launched on an electronic mail program called Sendmail.andO;RTM had discovered that the program's seldom-used debugging utility allowedusers to send a set of commands instead of a user's address.andP;  Through thegaping security hole went the worm's grappling hook, and, as in the Fingerdattack, in less than a minute a new, fully functioning copy of the worm wasrunning on the target machine.andM;The worm made another attack, not so much on a security hole but on thenetwork's community of trust.andP;  Once a machine was invaded, the worm attemptedto connect with remote machines that &quot;trusted&quot; the invaded machine and didn'trequire a password.andP;  The techniques were similar to what RTM had described asa teenager in a Bell Labs paper he wrote about a &quot;weakness&quot; in security thatallows &quot;users on untrusted and possibly ver distant hosts to masquerade asusers on trusted hosts.&quot;andM;These were the cracked windows, loose hinges, and open doors upon which theworm directed its principal attacks.andP;  But the worm also tried to find keyslying around, checking to see if an account had no password, and thenattempting simple heuristics using a combination of words from a user'saccount, including names, nicknames, and names spelled backward.andM;If these attacks failed, the worm would try its internal dictionary of 432passwords.andP;  But the task of cracking new passwords was a time-consumingprocess.andP;  The only passwords publicly available were encrypted.andP;  To figureout the true password behind its encrypted double, the worm had to encryptits own internal list of probable passwords against those it attempted tocrack.andM;If two encrypted passwords matched, the worm knew that its original password(before the worm encrypted it) was identical to the password it was trying tocrack.andP;  Since virtually every target password was encrypted under a differentkey, each target password forced the worm to re-encrypt its list of possiblepasswords.andP;  After trying this strategy for a few seconds, the worm triedwords from Unix's online dictionary, using the same tedious encryptionmethod.andP;  Cycling through its arsenal of attacks, the worm continuallycamouflaged and transformed itself.andP;  Immediately upon arriving in a newcomputer, the worm deleted the disk copy of itself and ran only in memoryunder the alias of an innocuous command interpreter, the kind often used inshell scripts or automatic commands.andM;Every three minutes, the worm forked, splitting into a dead parent and achild.andP;  The child started off &quot;fresh,&quot; using to apparent resources such asprocessing time or memory usage.andP;  The short dashes made the worm moredifficult to seize, even if it happened to be spotted.andM;THE WORM LEFT FEW CLUES.andP;  It read all its support files into memory, deletingfile system copies that might be noticed.andP;  And by turning off the generationof core files, if the worm made a mistake and accidentally died, it left nocorpse behind.andP;  Once every 15 infections, the worm attempted to connect to aBerkeley computer.andP;  RTM had hoped the &quot;red herring,&quot; as he called it, mightby itself shift suspicion onto the computer center, but it never actuallymade the connection.andM;Finally, if the worm, or parts of it, were somehow captured, the binary (nearmachine-level) program would require many hours of complex decompilationbefore its nuts and bolts could be understood.andM;For nearly three weeks RTM worked sporadically on the worm, increasing thenumber and complexity of its potential assaults.andP;  Its diverse collection ofattack strategies gave it a character more like that of a bulky battleshipthan a sleek submarine, and one friend and security expert later called it&quot;everything but the kitchen sink.&quot;andM;RTM collected password files form computers at Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley,and other universities around the country; he found the fast encryptionroutine he needed in a program written at Bell Labs; he incorporatedpassword-breaking techniques his father had discussed in his classic paper onUnix security.andP;  RTM didn't want to omit anything,and he feverishly threw adecade of security training into the worm.andP;  There was little time to checkfor errors; besides, the Shockwave Rider didn't make mistakes:andM;&quot;'How the hell were you able to build a tapeworm this complicated&quot;'  It's atalent, like a musician's or a poet's.andP;  I can play a computer read-inliterally for hours at a time and never hit a wrong note.&quot;andM;Everything seemed to be going exactly as planned.andP;  On Wednesday, November 2,1988, RTM logged on to his terminal at Cornell's Upson Hall at a little after10 a.m.andP;  and worked until lunch.andP;  In the afternoon, the trouble began.andM;RTM noticed a posting from Keith Bostic, of Berkeley: a patch to the FTP bughe had discovered on his fateful visit to Harvard.andP;  RTM quickly typed out anelectronic mail message to Sudduth, asking whether he had been the source ofthe leak.andM;&quot;I didn't think it was a good idea to spread information about randomsecurity holes,&quot; Morris later testified.andM;Sudduth sensed panic in his friend.andP;  &quot;Maybe he worried that the [other] bugswould be patched before he sent his worm.&quot;andM;At 8 p.m.andP;  EST, sitting at his Upson Hall terminal, RTM copied the worm to anaccount at MIT known to be frequented by hackers.andP;  &quot;I wanted to start it outso it wouldn't be obvious that I had started the worm myself,&quot; Morristestified.andP;  (The final version of the worm did not include attacks on the nowpatched FTP bug.)andP;  For the next 20 minutes, RTM tried to track the worm'spath, but as far as he could tell, &quot;it wasn't working right.andP;  It seemed tohave been getting bogged down, not really doing very much.&quot;andM;And so, having begun his experiment, RTM left his terminal and walked home.andM;ON INTERNET, THE WORM WAS AWAKENING.andP;  One hour and 24 minutes after itsrelease, the worm squirmed its way across the country and into the computersof a Santa Monica defense contractor, the Rand Corporation.andM;In two hours it hit the major gateway at the University of California,Berkeley; the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, in Berkeley and Livermore; andthe Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico.andP;  Very quickly it becameapparent that something had gone terribly wrong.andP;  Individual machines becameinfected by not one or two but several worms.andP;  Then, the infection erupted.andM;Since university and military computers are rarely used so late at night,they generally register only a 1 or 2 load average of a possible 100.andP;  But by9:21 p.m.andP;  PST, computers at the University of Utah had already documented aload of 5.andP;  Twenty minutes later, the load reached 7; in another 20 minutes,16; and incredibly, in just another five minutes, the system topped out at100, choking to a standstill.andM;Of course, as his lawyer later argued, RTM had been careful to ensure thathis worm not read, belete, or in any way damage targeted computers.andP;  But hehadn't counted on a more insidious risk.andP;  Simply by reproducing, the worm wassucking the oxygen out of Internet the way algae strangle a dying sea.andM;RTM's birth control wasn't working quite the way he had planned.andP;  Only thefirst virus on a machine listened for others.andP;  Subsequent worms didn't heareach other and didn't submit to the killer dice roll.andP;  And those few wormsthat lost the roll were allowed to continue their efforts to propagate newcopies of themselves on other machines, even after they'd received deathsentences.andM;Emergency teams at Berkeley, MIT, and other computer centers workedfrantically to stop the invader.andP;  Though the wormd didn't appear to bedirectly damaging files, the rescue workers desperately searched for hiddentrap doors, Trojan horses, or time bombs.andP;  By midnight EST, NASA's AmesResearch Center, in Silicon Valley, had shut off all communications withoutside researchers, stranding 52,000 computer users.andP;  Minutes earlier, oneof the Berkeley scientists on the front line had sent out an electronicS.O.S.andP;  over the net: &quot;We are under attack from an Internet virus...&quot;andM;&quot;No.andP;  We can't stop it!andP;  There's never been a worm with that tough a head orthat long a tail.andP;  It's building itself, don't you understand?andP;  Already it'spassed a billion bits and it's still growing ...andP;  and now it's so goddamncomprehensive that it can't be killed.andP;  Not short of demolishing the net!&quot;andM;While computer experts across the country raced to salvage what they could ofthe worm's wreckage, RTM sat dazed.andP;  When he telphoned Sudduth, his voice wasdeathly quiet.andP;  Sudduth passed the receiver to Graham, who listened to thebarely audible voice and wondered whether Morris had broken up with hisgirlfriend.andM;&quot;I really F_____ed up,&quot; said Morris as he quietly described how his worm wasreproducing like a virulent cancer, jamming Internet with resource-sappingcopies of itself.andP;  Graham was stunned.andP;  He had thought the project was faroff in the future.andM;&quot;RTM, you idiot!&quot; he yelled, angry at his friend for &quot;blowing&quot; such a greatidea.andP;  Then he asked, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;andM;&quot;Well, you remember the number I picked?&quot;andM;The two worked on possible cures.andP;  It was nearly midnight, and the worm hadbeen racing through Internet for four hours.andP;  Graham suggested that theycreate a Pac-Man cannibal worm to gobble up the worms.andP;  &quot;I didn't do that,because I had messed up with the first one,&quot; Morris later testified.andM;The two couldn't agree on a strategy, and the conversation ended.andP;  Grahamwent to Sudduth's office practically bursting with his secret.andP;  &quot;Somethingreally big is up.andP;  I can't tell you.&quot;andM;&quot;F_____k you, Paul!&quot; shot back the Olympic rower.andM;&quot;Well ...andP;  Robert wrote this virus,&quot; Graham said, &quot;and it's taking over everycomputer in the country!&quot;andM;Sudduth punched out an e-mail message.andP;  Though surprised that Morris wasn'tdoing more to stop the worm, he guessed his friend was finding it hard toadmit that &quot;something he created was out of control!&quot;andP;  Morris phoned back andtold Sudduth how to stop the worm from spreading on Harvard's computers.andM;Later, at about 1:30 a.m., Morris called Sudduth from his home phone.andP;  Thetwo decided that Sudduth should publish the worm antidotes onInternet--anonymously.andM;&quot;I was scared,&quot; Morris later testified.andP;  &quot;I knew people would be annoyedabout this because it was causing problems, and I wasn't particularly eagerto catch the blame for this at that time.&quot;andM;Why didn't Morris send the warning?andM;&quot;Well, I was at home,&quot; testified the driven programmer, who had been known towork till dawn.andP;  &quot;I don't have computer access at home.andP;  I suppose I couldhave walked back to Cornell at 2 in the morning ...andP;  but even then I wasn'tsure I could get access to the network.&quot;andP;  Critics later questioned why Morrisdidn't simply telephone computer experts at Berkeley or MIT, but somehow,after having grown up online, in the electronic net, that direct,non-computer solution seemed to have escaped him.andM;Friends have a simpler explanation.andP;  Morris, quite unlike his hero, theShockwave Rider, was simply &quot;frightened out of his wits.&quot;andM;&quot;'Precipice is going to be attacked with nukes at 0130!'andP;  [The ShockwareRider] aunched into a burst of furious activity, punching his board withfingers that flew faster than a pianist's.andP;  '...  Run like hell--because thismay not work'&quot;andM;SUDDUTH WORKED TO GET THE WORD OUT.andP;  By now, the system was clogged.andP;  theonly connection he could find was to a bulletin board at Brown University,hardly a center for Unix or Internet.andP;  The tired system manager typed out theantidote, describing how to close the holes and protect against new attacks,ending with the odd phrase, &quot;I hope this helps, but even more, I hope it's ahoax.&quot;andM;At about 4 a.m., Sudduth finally dragged himself to bed.andP;  Computer centersaround the nation were in the process of shutting down the relay centers thatmight pass the worm--and its antidote.andP;  His friend had already been fastasleep for two hours.andM;The next morning, Morris worked on some school-work he had neglected and&quot;just generally tried to relax.&quot;andP;  In the evening he went to choir practice.andM;Almost 24 hours had passed since he'd released the worm.andP;  When he returned toUpson Hall, he logged on to read his mail.andP;  The system seemed to be workingfine.andP;  Morris read several Cornell notices about a &quot;loose virus&quot; that seemedunder control, although users were warned to &quot;be careful&quot;; some notices fromKeith Bostic about patching security holes that the worm had used; and amessage from Paul Graham asking him to call.andP;  There was something else Morrisdid at Upson Hall on November 3:andM;&quot;Yes, I believe I cleaned up some of my files.&quot;andM;&quot;By 'cleaned up,' you mean you deleted some of the files?&quot; probed theprosecution.andM;&quot;I deleted some of my files, yes.&quot;andM;&quot;And that copy of the virus you left on your account, that was encrypted,that was in an encrypted form, wasn't it?andM;&quot;It was.andP;  Yes.&quot;andM;Once again, Morris left Upson Hall and returned home to make a phone call.andO;Graham excitedly informed him that the worm and disclosure of its staggeringimpact &quot;was about to get into newspapers, and that it might be a big sort ofmedia event.&quot;andM;Morris &quot;screwed up&quot; his courage and called his father, the computer securityexpert, because he &quot;felt that he ought to know.&quot;andP;  Morris senior was notamused.andP;  He told his son to go home and not to talk to anybody.andP;  &quot;So then Iwent to bed and I left Cornell the next day,&quot; Morris testified.andM;But the true Shockwave Rider never abandoned the front line.andP;  With a nuclearbomber zeroing in, he bravely hacked out the commands to avert the attack:andM;&quot;And you did it in less than ten minutes?&quot;andM;&quot;Looking back on it, I feel I had all the time in the world.&quot;andM;MEANWHILE, MORRIS WAS RETREATING, though not as smoothly as planned.andP;  One ofhis friends had inadvertently let RTM's log-on and nickname slip to JohnMarkoff, a reporter from The New York Times who happened to have writtenextensively on computer security and who counted among his friends one of thenation's leading computer security experts, Robert Morris, Sr.andM;The reporter used an Internet account to &quot;Fingerd&quot; RTM, and the programfaithfully flashed the name Robert T. Morris.andP;  When the reporter calledMorris senior and noted the similarity of their names, the elaborate&quot;experiment&quot; unraveled.andP;  Morris junior's secret trail of anonymous accounts,red herrings, and encrypted files suddenly became the machinations of anadolescent playing war games.andM;Officials at MIT estimated that 6,000 of the nation's 60,000 Internetcomputers had been invaded.andP;  The country's top computer experts spent severalsleepless days and nights battling and cleaning up after the attack, whiletens of thousands of military and university researchers went withoutcomputer power.andP;  (Blocked at the relay point, Sudduth's antidote had not beendelivered for two days.)andP;  The tab for the wasted time and resources wasestimated at $15 million.andM;Three days after the attack, The New York Times began a series of front-pagestories about the missing Internet attacker, Robert Tappan Morris.andP;  WhileMorris maintained a public silence ordered first by his father and then byhis Washington, D.C., attorney, the FBI began an investigation, andgovernment and university officials harshly criticized the hacker.andM;Old Bell Labs colleagues like Douglas McIlroy were puzzled by their progeny'sslip.andP;  &quot;What I don't understand is the secrecy part of it.andP;  All of thejuvenile tricks, encrypting source files to launch from some other machine,encrypting the program,&quot; says the scientist.andP;  &quot;That's not consonant with afun-loving kid.&quot;andM;Yet many computer security experts--some of them friends and formerassociates of Morris senior--rose to Morris junior's defense.andP;  They said hisexperiment was a harmless, overdue warning of gross gaps in computersecurity, and argued that Morris should be cheered, not convicted.andM;&quot;When all is said and done, this kid is going to come down as a folk hero,&quot;Peter Neuman, a computer security expert at SRI international (one of Morrisjunior's former employers) told The New York Times.andM;Of course, the hacker is the hero--in fiction.andP;  The Shockwave Rider liberatesthe masses from a corrupt, computer-controlled government with afreedom-fighting worm, risks his life to foil a nuclear attack, wins hisgirl's heart, and is praised by the world.andP;  But Morris had no such righteousintentions.andP;  He had no social or moral agenda, and never intended to exposeInternet's well-known security limitations.andP;  His worm had no other purposethan to spread as far and wide as possible, and if it had spread as planned,slowly, innocuously, most say the response would have been even greaterpanic.andM;The world that Morris's worm entered was far removed from his boyhoodcomputer security training in the hallowed research halls of Bell Labs.andP;  Inthe decade since his code-cracking childhood, computers leapt into themainstream to become the foundation of business and commerce.andP;  Assaults oncomputers became assaults on industry, and by the mid-1980s terroristcomputer attacks and malicious break-ins revealed the dark side of hacking,forever ending the playful era of his father, when hacking was a rite ofpassage.andM;Therein lay the irony and tragedy of the trial of Robert Morris.andP;  He wasbeing tried for what he was taught by his father, his institutions, and hisgeneration: access, unauthorized.andP;  The trouble was, as the would-be securityexpert wrote in one of his early papers, &quot;Times have changed.&quot;andM;Some were not prepared for the change.andP;  On the day before the verdict, aHarvard professor warned that &quot;if Robert had wanted to do damage, there wouldhave been nothing left!andP;  All the computers would have gone up in smoke!&quot;andO;Another Harvard friend suggested that if Morris were &quot;unjustly punished,&quot; itmight inspire a less restrained, less idealistic hacker to &quot;do it right.&quot;andO;The reasoning was similar to Morris's main line of defense.andM;&quot;Was it your intention to have the worm program destroy or damage any files?&quot;andO;asked the defense attorney.andM;&quot;No, it was not.&quot;andM;&quot;Was it possible for you to do that?&quot;andM;&quot;It would have been easy to do that.&quot;andM;The implication was ominous, and at least one close friend of Morris's wasnot convinced that everything was OK just because his bored buddy hadn'tpulled the trigger.andP;  &quot;On some level I know why he did this, and on some levelI don't,&quot; says Kuperberg, glancing away and pacing like the old roommate hestruggle to defend.andP;  &quot;On some level [Morris senior's explanation of boredom]is not satisfactory.&quot;andM;No answer seemed likely to come from the one person who might know.andP;  Afterthe guilty verdict was issued in his trial, Morris and his attorney walkedpast the jostling TV crews and newspaper reporters and into the winter night.andM;His father held back.andP;  The press surrounded him and the TV lights shoneeerily on his face.andP;  &quot;What do you feel, Mr. Morris?andP;  What do you feel?&quot;andM;He chose his words carefully, stiffly stating that the trial had been fair,though he was not happy with the verdict.andP;  The question came again, and thistime he spoke with conviction:  &quot;It's perfectly obvious that there is not afraudulent or dishonest bone in his body.&quot;andM;IN THE WORM'S WAKE, there has been no great improvement in security, butfresh concern that future computer communication tools used by the averagecitizen may have to be weighed down by cumbersome locks and chains.andP;  For, asMorris senior wrote in his treatise on Unix security, &quot;It is easy to run asecure computer system.andP;  You merely have to disconnect all dial-upconnections and permit only direct-wired terminals, put the machine and itsterminals in a shielded room, and post a guard at the door.&quot;andM;Such is the bleak reality of total computer security, and if history is anylesson, computers, too, will move through cycles, bringing periods of coldwar as well as openness.andP;  In the end, security is trust, which must benurtured and cultivated like any other human quality.andP;  Morris wanted to be ahero, yet he lacked the patience and vision to forge a new direction.andM;&quot;What would have been great is if he had shut the holes after himself.andP;  Thatwould have been a coup,&quot; says Peter McIlroy.andP;  &quot;If he had thought of that, Ithink he would have done it.&quot;andM;But RTM wanted nothing of the sort.andP;  In the private war he waged it was hisduty to hold on to the holes, to wield them in the way he &quot;knew they wouldn'tmind.&quot;andM;And Robert Tappan Morris?andP;  He was just a kid.andM;&quot;He might have been trained to display such powers of judgment; he might havebeen specially bred to possess them.andP;  One thing was sure: he hadn't livedlong enough to grow into them.&quot;andM;Jonathan Littman is the author of Once Upon a Time in ComputerLand (Simon andamp;Schuster, 1990).andP;
