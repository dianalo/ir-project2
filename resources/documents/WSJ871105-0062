Southland said its investment bankers need more time to sell the debt to complete the transaction.    As reported, Thompson Co., controlled by top executives of Dallas-based Southland and sons of the company's founder, has proposed acquiring the convenience-store retailer in a $4 billion leveraged buyout. Thompson already owns more than two-thirds of Southland's shares outstanding, acquired in a $77-a-share tender offer this summer.    However, the stock market's volatility has made it difficult for the company's investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc., to sell $1.5 billion in subordinated debt needed to finance the purchase. A Southland spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate on the status of the debt sale, except to say that the bankers need more time to complete it.    Terms of the transaction call for Thompson to acquire the remaining shares outstanding for $61.32 in cash and 0.6672 shares of a new preferred stock if shareholders approve. Although Southland's stock has traded at considerably less than the purchase price, Thompson hasn't proposed reducing its offer.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Southland closed at $64.50, up $2.25. </TEXT></DOC>
