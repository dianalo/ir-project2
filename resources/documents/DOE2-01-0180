The equipment performs switching operations inthe shortest possible time and takes account of the state of two supplynetworks. Where two such facilities were previously required, high-speedtransfer can now be performed by a single automatic bus coupling systemfrom Brown Boveri, which combines the functions of the earlier equipmentwith fewer modules than before.</TEXT></DOC>
