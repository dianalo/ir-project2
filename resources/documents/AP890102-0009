Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vastexpansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, fasterpension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women,and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchaseson credit.   Others that occurred just before the end of 1988 or are scheduledearly in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by privateemployers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and largelayoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminatingagainst the handicapped and families with children.   A few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impacteventually may be felt by the entire population.   For example, Environmental Protection Agency regulationsimplementing the 46-nation ozone treaty took effect Jan. 1. Theregulations don't require chemical companies to actually do anythinguntil next July, but then they must cut their production ofchloroflourocarbon or CFC compounds by an estiamted 20 percent backto 1986 levels.   The treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer15 to 25 miles up protecting the earth's surface from ultravioletrays. CFC compounds also contribute to the ``greenhouse'' effectthat is warming the planet.   As a result of the regulations, consumers may notice fewerplastic food containers from fast-food outlets, thicker insulatingpanels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions.   The biggest of the immediate changes is the Jan 1. expansion ofMedicare coverage for 32 million Medicare beneficiaries to includecatastrophic health care costs.   Prior to passage of the measure last summer by Congress _ thefirst major expansion of Medicare in its 22-year history _ theprogram paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year.   With the changes that took effect Sunday, the beneficiary stillwill have to pay the first-day deductible of $560. But that chargewill be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many timesthe patient has to be hospitalized. The other 364 days are fullypaid.   That fundamental change in the hospital benefit was thecornerstone of the Medicare expansion set in motion by PresidentReagan in his 1986 State of the Union message.   ``Let us remove a financial specter facing our older Ameicans _the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having tomake an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death,'' he saidthen.   Medicare enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flatincrease in the premium deducted from their monthly Social Securitychecks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax.   The flat increase will be $4 a month effective immediately,climbing to $10.20 monthly in 1993. The sliding scale premium isprojected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income taxliability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993.   Many of the Jan. 1 changes grow out of the 1986 Tax Reform Act.The biggest new benefit from that law is faster vesting in pensionplans.   The maximum waiting period for employees to become fully investedin a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years.   However, employers can adopt an option that denies full vestinguntil seven years. To do so, they have to offer 20 percent vestingafter three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annuallyuntil the seventh year, when it reaches 100 percent.   The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that thepension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million moreworkers a year.   ``We'll especially see more women being vested than in the pastbecause they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employerfor shorter periods,'' said Stephanie Poe, a spokeswoman for theinstitute.   Another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interestpayments on everything from car and student loans to credit cardcharges will be deductible in 1989, compared with 40 percent lastyear.   And while the government is now raising tax brackets, exemptionsand standard deductions to keep cost-of-living raises from bumpingpeople into higher brackets, it also is taking more Social Securitytaxes.   The 7.51 percent Social Security tax took a maximum $3,380 out ofemployee paychecks in 1988. This year the maximum amount of incomesubject to the tax rises from $45,000 to $48,000, raising themaximum Social Security tax that can be collected from an individualemployee to $3,605.   The latest change came about just last Thursday, when the FederalAviation Administration ordered airlines, effective Jan. 1, toeither inspect by hand or X-ray all luggage checked aboard U.S.airline flights from western Europe and the Middle East.   The new inspections, prompted by the bombing of a Pan Am jet overScotland on Dec. 21, are expected to delay passenger check-ins byabout an hour.   Other changes taking effect slightly before or after New Year'sDay include:   _ The use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employersto screen job applicants was outlawed, with some exceptions,effective last Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union estimatesthe law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 millionpolygraph exams now administered annually.   _ A 47-year-old ban on homework in five apparel trades is beingremoved on Jan. 8, unless unions which support the prohibitions wina court stay first. Affected are an estimated 50,000 to 75,000workers in fields such as mittens and gloves, embroideries, buttonsand buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades. They will beable to work legally at home for the first time if their employersobtain a certficate from the Labor Department after pledging toabide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards.   _ A law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice ofplant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officiallytakes effect Feb. 4. However, there are different interpretations onwhether companies are required to have provided 60 days noticebeforehand if they close a plant on that date. The Labor Departmentadvised in early December that, to avoid potential liability, theyshould.   _ Regulations implementing a law passed by Congress last summerforbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped orfamilies with children take effect March 12. Violators can be finedup to $10,000 for a first offense, $25,000 for a second violation ina five-year period and $50,000 for two or more violations within aseven-year period.</TEXT></DOC>
