Gordon Crovitz</HL><DATE>05/23/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A23</SO><LP>   His judicial chambers are just over the hills fromHollywood in Pasadena, but whatever the inspiration, JudgeAlex Kozinski found a way to grab the attention of antitrustparanoids. He managed to weave the names of more than 200movies into his court opinion declaring the innocence of amovie-theater operator accused of being a dirty rottenmonopolist.   Judge Kozinski deserves a special-category Oscar for thestyle and substance of U.S. v. Syufy Enterprises. His 25-pageopinion, issued May 9, is a witty reminder that even thefree-market antitrust revolutionaries of the Reagan JusticeDepartment committed abusive prosecutions.</LP><TEXT>   To be fair, if we're going to have government review ofmergers it's not surprising that the business strategy ofRaymond Syufy sounded alarm bells. Mr. Syufy, who ownsseveral hundred movie theaters in the West, decided to enterthe Las Vegas market in 1981. He was a fierce competitor,driving up bids to distributors for the rights to show topfilms. By 1984, three competitors, including national chainsMann and Plitt, sold out to Mr. Syufy, leaving only a smallcompetitor.   In a complaint signed by then-antitrust chief DouglasGinsburg, now a federal appeals-court judge, Justice accusedMr. Syufy of monopoly by gobbling up competitors. But a funnything had happened by the time the case reached the courts.   Syufy may well have intended to become a monopolist, butonly results count. Syufy itself provided the best evidencethat there was no barrier preventing competitors fromentering the market. When Syufy cornered the first-runmarket, it apparently tested its new market power by renegingon a deal with Orion distributors. Orion responded by suing,cutting off all Syufy theaters nationwide and givingfirst-run films to the remaining Las Vegas competitor.Quickly, Syufy's &quot;utopia proved to be only a mirage,&quot; JudgeKozinski wrote.   (Lawyers will probably read this case as much for moviespotting as for its holding. A footnote hints there are 204film titles secreted in the text, but I could find only 31.Journal movie reviewer Julie Salamon, armed with her lawdegree, managed to find 70 movies including the obscureStatic, The Gate and Avalanche. Try your luck with theexcerpts nearby, with the consolation that Judge Kozinskisays he's been a buff since he learned about America throughmovies while growing up in Romania.)   Syufy went from locking up rights to more than 90% of thefirst-run movies in 1985 to less than 40% by 1988. JudgeKozinski wrote that the competing theater owner &quot;evolved fromabsolute beginners, barely staying alive, into a bigbusiness.&quot; Within two years, the competitor had more screensthan Syufy. &quot;Syufy's acquisitions did not short circuit theoperation of the natural market forces.&quot;   Judge Kozinski rejected the idea that Syufy somehow brokeany law by knocking the other theater operators out ofbusiness by tough competition. He cited a classic judicialopinion of this big-is-bad school, Judge Learned Hand'sopinion demanding the breakup of Alcoa in 1945 because it hadbecome too efficient. Alcoa's success may be &quot;evidence of theskill, energy and initiative with which it has alwaysconducted its business,&quot; Judge Hand wrote, &quot;but we can thinkof no more effective exclusion than progressively to embraceeach new opportunity as it opened. . . .&quot;   Competing too well has now been decriminalized by severalSupreme Court cases interpreting the vague antitrust laws. AsJudge Kozinski noted, &quot;While the successful competitor shouldnot be raised above the law, neither should he be held downby law.&quot; Indeed, if Justice had followed its own mergerguidelines there probably would have been no case. Its testis whether a new competitor is likely to enter the marketwithin two years. Even if a firm has a huge market share,there is no violation of the Sherman Act if there's no powerto exclude competitors; there's no Clayton Act problem wherethere are no barriers to entry for competitors.   This case earned the ultimate insult a court can givegovernment lawyers -- it was a waste of time. Judge Kozinski,appointed by President Reagan in 1985, wrote that &quot;It is atribute to the state of competition in America that theAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice has found noworthier target than this paper tiger on which to expendtaxpayer resources.&quot;   Indeed, if there is any barrier to competition it may bethis kind of government-instigated litigation. &quot;Regulationoften helps entrench existing businesses by placing newentrants at a competitive disadvantage,&quot; Judge Kozinskiwrote. &quot;It is perhaps less well appreciated that litigationitself can be a form of regulation; lawsuits brought by thegovernment impose significant costs.&quot; He said that &quot;forcompetitors in a free market to fear buying each other lestthey be hit with the expense and misery of an antitrustenforcement action amounts to a burden only slightly lesspalpable than a direct governmental prohibition against sucha purchase.&quot;   This prosecution means it's still what Judge Kozinskimight call high noon for the free-market revolution inantitrust law. Monopoly seems impossible without some barrierto entry created by the government, such as limiting landingslots at airports or granting utility monopolies. Indeed, thelesson of the Syufy case is that overenforcement may be thegreater sin.   How about a new approach? Why not require Justice first tofind some evidence that there is a government barrier tocompetitors entering a market. Only if some governmentinterference is found should regulators or prosecutors evenbegin to consider bringing an antitrust case.   There is no reason to go back to the days of bureaucratsmandating the &quot;correct&quot; size of firms. Give the last word toJudge Kozinski, with supporting roles by Ayn Rand and GaryCooper: &quot;Personal initiative, not government control, is thefountainhead of progress in a capitalist economy.&quot;   ---   Federal judge Alex Kozinski inserted the names of 204films into his opinion in favor of a movie theater operator.Treat yourself to popcorn if you can find 10 or more titlesin these excerpts:                                                                                                          &quot;unlike centrally planned economies, where decisions aboutproduction and allocation are made by government bureaucratswho ostensibly see the big picture and know to do the rightthing, capitalism relies on decentralized planning.&quot;   &quot;The antitrust laws do not require that rivals compete ina dead heat, only that neither is unfairly kept from doinghis personal best.&quot;   &quot;Syufy always treated moviegoers fairly: The movietickets, popcorn, nuts and the seven-ups cost about the samein Las Vegas as in other, comparable markets.&quot;   &quot;Support is missing in the record for the JusticeDepartment's theory of a shakedown by a ruthless predator.&quot;                                                                                                          Movie titles: The Big Picture, Big, Do The Right Thing,Dead Heat, Personal Best, Always, Popcorn, Nuts, TheSeven-Ups, Missing, Shakedown, Ruthless and Predator.</TEXT></DOC>
