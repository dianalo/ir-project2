Inc., said its fiscalfirst-quarter profit rose over a year ago.   Meanwhile, Charles Schwab Corp., a San Francisco-based discountbrokerage firm, said it had a sharp earnings increase in the threemonths ended Sept. 30. Merrill Lynch, based in New York, said netincome from continuing operations fell to $43.2 million, or 36cents per share, from $56.1 million, or 49 cents, in 1988. Revenuerose 10 percent to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion.

That compared with earnings of $20.92 million, or50 cents a share, in 1988.   Merrill Lynch said the third-quarter results ``reflected anindustry-wide softness in some of our core business activities.''   ``The lower volume of underwritng activity and principaltransactions were partially offset by revenue increases fromcommissions and asset management fees,'' the company said in astatement.   For the first nine months of this year, Merrill Lynch said itearned $144.4 million from continuing operations, or $1.23 a share,compared with a profit of $164.1 million , or $1.45 a share, in1988.   Bear Stearns Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said he was pleased withthe first-quarter results ``because several of our departments ...were operating in a very difficult environment.''   He said the company saw a decline in principal transactionsduring the quarter due to a drop in government bond tradingactivities, among other things.   PaineWebber said third quarter results included a broad-basedimprovement in core businesses. It said the 1988 results included apretax gain of $46.3 million, and without that, the quarter wouldhave shown a loss.
