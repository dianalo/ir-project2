The provision was part of a larger measure crafted by committeechairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, that also would enable the workingpoor to take fuller advantage of tax credits for child care alreadyavailable to everyone.   Democratic leaders are contemplating having the measure debatedthis week on the Senate floor. It is certain to produce sparks notonly because of the innovative new health tax credit, but alsobecause it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits thananother major Democratic initiative, yet differs significantly fromyet another child care program proposed by President Bush.   The 17-3 vote by which the measure cleared committee was not atrue measure of its overall support even among committee members.Several Republicans who voted for it said they had seriousreservations and were acting largely to spur consideration of childcare legislation.   ``I know there is going to be a big battle with the ABC bill onthe floor,'' said Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., a committee member andthe Senate GOP leader. ``Maybe we'll end up without any child carebill at all.''   Dole's reference to the ``ABC'' bill was to a measure by Sen.Chris Dodd, D-Conn., that envisions a much more expensive child careprogram and one that generates additional controversy because itwould impose national standards on day-care providers.   The Bentsen legislation aims at providing about $10.5 billion inadditional benefits over a five-year period without increasing thefederal budget deficit. It would raise the money by keeping theexisting 3 percent telephone excise tax in place indefinitely ratherthan allowing it to expire after Dec. 31, 1990 under current law.   The measure also would delay for one year the imposition ofso-called Section 89 of the tax code governing tax deductions foremployer-paid health insurance and simplify the rules once they dotake effect.   Although having little direct impact on individuals, the Section89 provisions have generated a huge outcry from businessescomplaining largely about the complexity of compliance.   The rules are intended to discourage richer health insurancepolicies for executives than for rank-and-file workers byprohibiting bigger tax breaks for such executive plans.   The new rules would simply record-keeping procedures and clarifyeligibility tests for what would constitute impermissibly subsidizedpolicies.   Although some members expressed skepticism that the healthinsurance tax credit would help much, Bentsen said he was encouragedby testimony before the Finance Committee on Monday by a Blue Crossvice president who predicted the insurance industry would developpolicies aimed directly at children if a new federal subsidy is madeavailable to help pay for them.   He said such policies are already available in California forabout $250 a year per child.   The new tax credit would be up to 50 percent of the cost of apolicy up to $1,000, resulting in a maximum of $500 for a familywith $12,000 or less income. The percentage decreases steadily untilthe credit would not be available for a family with more than$21,000 income.   The policy would have to cover at least one dependent child underage 19, but also could cover other family members, including adults.   ``Here we're trying to get at the working poor,'' Bentsen said.   The health tax credit would be ``refundable.'' That is, a familythat qualifies for the tax credit, but does not make enough money tohave to pay income tax, would get the benefit in the form of a cashgrant.   Bentsen's package also makes an existing tax credit refundable sopoorer Americans would be able to claim the same benefit even ifthey do not incur an income tax liability.   The current credit is up to 30 percent for child care costs up to$4,800 for a household with two or more eligible children or $2,400for one child.   The 30 percent credit is available only to households with incomebelow $10,000 and falls by 1 percentage point for each $2,000 ofadjusted gross income between $10,000 and $28,000. Above $28,000,the maximum credit is 20 percent.   In addition to making the credit refundable, the Bentsen billwould increase the credit to 32 percent for taxpayers with incomebetween $8,000 and $10,000 a year and to 34 percent for those makingbelow $8,000 a year.   In other words, a single mother working for the minimum wage andpaying $40 a week for a babysitter would be eligible for a $980 taxcredit _ in cash if necessary _ rather than the $624 deduction fromtaxes due under current law.</TEXT></DOC>
