Daily News on the Customs Service:   The federal government is at it again, proving that it can turn asilk purse into a sow's ear.   This time it is the Customs Service that earns our ire. It seemsthat despite netting more than $1 billion in property seizures in1988, Customs managed to rack up millions in red ink. ...   The Customs debacle is an outrage. Taxpayers are getting squeezedmore each year in user fees, Social Security taxes, higher healthcosts, etc. We have little choice but to accept these fees. But weneed not accept ineptitude and incompetence on the part of thefederal government.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 23   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on coal strike violence:   United Mine Workers members who struck the Pittston Coal Groupcompanies justly felt desperation. Their employer seems intent onbreaking the union and has resorted to cutting off pensions andmedical benefits, while running a media campaign that makes the firmsound benevolent. ...   At first, the strikers acted in the non-violent tradition ofMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. They blocked coal-haulingroads with their bodies, inviting arrest in the classic style ofcivil disobedience.   But when other miners began a wildcat strike against otherunionized mines _ ignoring the no-strike contract they had entered,and idling a third of the nation's coal production _ they turnedincreasingly to violence that damages their cause, demoralizes theirsympathizers and, in West Virginia's case, undermines their state....   The union plays into the companies' hands by lawless conduct.Members speed the decline of their union by their actions. If (unionPresident) Richard Trumka or other UMW officials can end theviolence they should do so.   But no matter what anyone else should do, the state of WestVirginia should enforce the law. When mobs roam the land, no one issafe.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 24   The Houston Post on private club membership:   It is Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's business if he wants to rejoin threeexclusive clubs from which he resigned after becoming the 1988Democratic vice presidential nominee. But he might explain why hefelt the memberships were inappropriate for a candidate seeking highnational office, while they are all right for a United Statessenator.   Bentsen's spokesman, Jack DeVore, says the three clubs _ theRiver Oaks Country Club and Ramada Club of Houston, and theMiddleburg Tennis Club in Virginia _ have no membershiprestrictions. But the River Oaks and Middleburg clubs have no blackmembers. The Ramada Club membership has been described as ``mixed.''   The senator was a member of the Houston clubs for 25 years beforeresigning last August when he became Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis' running mate. At the time, DeVore said Bentsen felt it was``the appropriate thing to do.'' Now he says associates have toldthe senator it is ``appropriate for him to rejoin.''   The only conclusion we can draw from this is that Bentsen didn'twant the memberships to become a presidential campaign issue, but nolonger considers them a political liability. How about basing it onwhat is right?</TEXT><TEXT>   June 23   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on disposable diapers:   Nearly nine out of every 10 babies born in the United Statesspend their first few years swaddled in plastic diapers. One by onethey add up: to 16 billion each year. ...   Despite their name, the diapers are far from ``disposable.''After a single wearing, most end up in municipal landfills wherethey provide a potential breeding ground for viruses and bacteriathat cause polio, hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases.   New ways of dealing with the diapers must be found. One suggestedapproach is to make the plastic liners in the diapers withbiodegradable corn starch which, supporters say, causes them todisintegrate 100 times faster.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 21   Saginaw (Mich.) News on the savings and loan crisis:   Having preserved some semblance of reason in the nationalinsanity that is the savings and loan scandal, Congress should nextseek to bring the crooks to justice.   It's not enough that Sandamp;Ls no longer will be permitted to pretendthat they have $20 billion in the, uh, bank. The House last weekrefused to let them count ``good will'' as a genuine capital asset.If public opinion is worth anything, in fact, at least that much haspiled up on the debit side of he ledger.   What catches our eye in the $285 billion bailout bill is not eventhat incredible figure. It is the mandate to go after the crooks whodid a real number on the nation.   When the measure comes up for final approval early in July, theHouse and Senate plan to allocate at least $50 million a year to theJustice Department through 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud atfinancial institutions. The maximum civil penalty for ``recklessdisregard for safety'' will be $1 million a day. The criminalpenalties will be $1 million per day or imprisonment for up to fiveyears.   Sound like a lot of money? Hey, somebody's got it. $300 billiondoesn't just evaporate. There are stories of Sandamp;L bosses collecting$8 million in bonuses as they threw money away like it wasn't theirs_ which, of course, it wasn't.   The Justice Department should bring in all the specialprosecutors it needs to find and convict these thieves.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
