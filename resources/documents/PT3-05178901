A coating of a      calcium phosphate compound adhering with great fastness to the surface of      the titanium metal is formed by preparing an aqueous slurry containing the      powder mentioned above, applying the aqueous slurry to the surface of the      titanium metal, and heat-treating the coated titanium metal. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a material capable of forming a coating film      adhering with great fastness to the surface of titanium or a titanium      alloy (hereinafter referred to as &quot;titanium metal&quot;), a method for the      production of the material, a method for coating a titanium metal with the      material, and titanium metal article coated with the material. This      material is compatible with living tissues. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Since titanium and titanium alloys possess high strength and exhibit no      toxicity to living tissues, efforts are being continued to realize their      utility as materials for artificial roots of teeth, artificial bones, and      artificial joints. The materials using titanium as a main component,      however, do not promote osteoinduction, osteoconduction or bonding of new      bones because they are inactive relative to living tissues. These      materials, therefore, are incapable of being kept buried in living tissues      in a stable state for a long time. In contrast, the calcium phosphate      compounds such as apatite hydroxide and tricalcium phosphate that are the      main components of such living inorganic substances as bones and teeth,      exhibit excellent bioaffinity for living tissues in terms of nontoxicity,      osteoconduction property, bone bonding property, and bone replacement      property. Sintered articles of calcium phosphate compounds, however have      low mechanical strength and, therefore, have limited utility. In view of      the circumstances described above, a composite material comprising      titanium or a titanium alloy as a substrate and a coating of calcium      phosphate covering the surface of the substrate and having a property of      bioaffinity and high strength is desired. </PAR><PAR>  The conventional methods of coating a materials having titanium as its main      component with a calcium phosphate compound are of three types, (1) the      flame spraying method, (2) the spattering method, and (3) the dispersing      method. The flame spraying method comprises dissolving calcium phosphate      powder in a flame or a plasma kept at a high temperature and spraying the      dissolved powder at a high speed on the surface of a material formed      mainly of titanium. Since this method has to be conducted at high      temperature, it often induces decomposition of the calcium phosphate and      alteration of the crystalline structure of the compound. The spattering      method comprises spattering a calcium phosphate compound onto the surface      of a material having titanium as its main component. Since this method      requires the spattering in a high degree of vacuum, the productivity is      low and the cost of production is high. Moreover, it is difficult to      produce a coating layer of a sufficient thickness by this method. The      glass dispersing method comprises dispersing a calcium phosphate compound      in molten glass, applying the resultant molten glass on the surface of a      material comprising titanium as its main component, and solidifying the      applied coating by cooling. The coating material prepared by this method      is deficient in durability in living tissue because the dissolving speed      of glass type material is higher than that of a crystal type material in      living tissues. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, each of the conventional methods for coating a surface      with calcium phosphate has its defects. </PAR><PAR>  In the circumstances, it is a need to develop a commercially feasible      method of coating a titanium metal with calcium phosphate, inexpensively      with a simple device. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present inventors continued a study with a view to meeting this need      and found that a CaO-TiO.sub.2 -P.sub.2 O.sub.5 type glass excels in fast      adhesiveness to a material having titanium as its main material and, when      heat-treated under suitable conditions, crystallizes into calcium      phosphate and calcium titano-phosphate. The present invention has been      completed on the basis of this knowledge. </PAR><PAR>  To be specific, this invention is directed to a method for the production      of a powdery material for coating the surface of a titanium metal,      comprising mixing compounds as raw materials for CaO, TiO.sub.2, and      P.sub.2 O.sub.5 in amounts to give a molar ratio of CaO:TiO.sub.2 :P.sub.2      O.sub.5, in the range of 9:4.6.about.5.4:5.6.about.6.4, adding to the      resultant mixture a sodium compound in an amount to give a concentration      as Na.sub.2 O in the range of 1 to 5 mol % based on the amount of said      mixture, fusing by heating the resultant mixture at a temperature of at      least 1,200.degree. C., cooling the resulting vitrified melt, and      pulverizing the resultant solid to a powdery material for coating the      surface of a titanium metal produced by the method described above, to a      method for forming a coating of a calcium phosphate compound on the      surface of a titanium metal, comprising converting the aforementioned      powdery material into an aqueous slurry, applying the aqueous slurry on      the surface of the titanium metal, and heating the titanium metal coated      with the aqueous slurry to a temperature in the range of 600.degree. to      1,300.degree. C., and a titanium metal material coated with the calcium      phosphate compound obtained by the method described above. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  In the present invention, the optimum value of the molar ratio of      CaO:TiO.sub.2 :P.sub.2 O.sub.5 is 9:5:6. </PAR><PAR>  It is necessary that the molar ratio of CaO:TiO.sub.2 :P.sub.2 O.sub.5      should fall in the range of 9:4.6.about.5.4:5.6.about.6.4. </PAR><PAR>  As regards the raw materials for CaO, TiO.sub.2, and P.sub.2 O.sub.5,      calcium carbonate may be used for CaO and phosphoric acid for P.sub.2      O.sub.5, for example. </PAR><PAR>  In this invention, the compounds as raw materials containing CaO,      TiO.sub.2, and P.sub.2 O.sub.5 are mixed with a sodium compound containing      Na.sub.2 O and the resultant mixture is fused by heating. The heating      temperature used in this case has to be sufficient to dissolve the raw      materials and is at least 1,200.degree. C. The raw material powder for      coating the surface of a titanium metal can be obtained by cooling the      fused raw materials and pulverizing the resultant solid. </PAR><PAR>  Now, the method for coating the surface of a titanium metal with a calcium      phosphate compound by the use of the raw material mentioned above will be      described. </PAR><PAR>  First, an aqueous slurry of the aforementioned raw material powders is      prepared. This aqueous slurry may be produced by mixing the raw material      powders produced by the method described above with water. Otherwise, it      may be obtained by casting the fused mixture into water thereby preparing      amorphous glass and pulverizing the glass in conjunction with water added      thereto. The aqueous slurry is required to have a powder concentration      sufficient to enable the aqueous slurry to be applied effectively to the      surface of a titanium metal. This concentration is desired to be in the      range of 15 to 25% by weight. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous slurry is applied to the surface of a titanium metal. The      method used for this application is not critical. It can be easily carried      out by any of the known methods such as, for example, the spraying method      or the dipping method. </PAR><PAR>  Then, by heat-treating the surface of the titanium metal coated with the      aqueous slurry at a temperature in the range of 650.degree. to      1,300.degree. C., calcium phosphate can be attached with high fastness to      the surface. </PAR><PAR>  As a result, a material of titanium metal coated with calcium phosphate can      be obtained. </PAR><PAR>  The process of fusion and crystallization of glass during the heat      treatment of the surface of a titanium metal coated with the aqueous      slurry in the method of the present invention will be described more      specifically. During the initial phase of the heat treatment, the glass      powder for the coating material is softened by fusion, caused to adhere      fast to the surface of the material using titanium as a main component      and, at the same time, enabled to react with the titanium oxide phase      present in the surface region of the titanium material and gain in      adhesive strength. In the latter phase of the heat treatment, the      formation of crystal seeds of calcium phosphate and calcium      titano-phosphate and the growth of crystals proceed and the      crystallization of calcium phosphate and calcium titanophosphate is      completed. No amorphous phase remains. The coating layer, therefore, has      high durability in living tissues. </PAR><PAR>  The Na.sub.2 O.sub.2 which is incorporated in the raw material powder in a      concentration in the range of 1 to 5 mol % serves the purpose of      accelerating the crystallization of calcium phosphate and calcium      titanophosphate in the latter phase of the aforementioned heat treatment. </PAR><PAR>  The method of this invention is capable of coating the surface of a      titanium metal with calcium phosphate, inexpensively by the use of a      simple device. Thus, this method has very high industrial utility. </PAR><PAR>  The calcium phosphate material for coating the surface of titanium metal      which is obtained by the method of this invention has a excellent      bioaffinity and high strength, and can be used advantageously in such      medical materials as artificial bones, artificial joints, and artificial      tooth roots. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAR>  Now, the present invention will be described more specifically with      reference to working examples. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  A raw material was prepared by mixing calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide      (anatase), and phosphoric acid in amounts to give a molar ratio,      CaO:TiO.sub.2 :P.sub.2 O.sub.5, of 9:5:6. This raw material and 2 mol % of      sodium carbonate added thereto were fused at 1,850.degree. C. The formed      metal was cast into water to produce amorphous glass. A slurry containing      20% of the glass was prepared by pulverizing the amorphous glass in      conjunction with added water. This slurry was applied by the spraying      method to a titanium material. The coated material was dried and then      heat-treated at 690.degree. C. for 23 hours. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, the surface of this titanium material was coated with a      calcium phosphate layer 200 .mu.m in thickness. The calcium phosphate      adhered fast to the titanium material. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was faithfully repeated, except that the      temperature of the heat treatment was changed to 800.degree. C. and the      time of this heat treatment was reduced to one hour. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, there was obtained a titanium material whose surface was      coated with a calcium phosphate layer 100 .mu.m in thickness. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was faithfully repeated, except that the      temperature of the heat treatment was changed to 1,200.degree. C., the      time of the heat treatment was reduced to one hour, and the heat treatment      was carried out in a vacuum furnace. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, there was obtained a titanium material whose surface was      coated with a calcium phosphate layer 100 .mu.m in thickness. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENT 1 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was faithfully repeated, except that the      treatment for converting the raw material powder for coating into      amorphous glass was omitted. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, no fast adhering coating layer was formed on the surface of      the titanium material. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENT 2 </PAC><PAR>  The procedure of Example 1 was faithfully repeated, except that the fusing      temperature of the raw material was changed to 900.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, the surface of the titanium material underwent oxidation and      no coating layer was formed on the surface. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
