Selectmen have decided that residents who receive generalassistance, a local form of welfare, cannot use the money topurchase disposable diapers.   ``Cloth diapers will be less expensive for the taxpayers,''Chairwoman Jean Harris said.   Harris said disposable diapers can cost more than $10 a box, andsome mothers buy up to four boxes each week.   Selectman W. Robert Donovan was the lone dissenter in Tuesday's3-1 vote on the issue. ``I'd just like to say, it's not the1950s,'' he said.   Local selectmen are permitted to decide how general assistancerecipients can spend the funds. Generally, the money is used forhousing, food, heating, health care and other life essential items.   About 400 residents will take advantage of Lisbon's $30,000general assistance fund this year, Town Manager John Baubier saidThursday.</TEXT></DOC>
