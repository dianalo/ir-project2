Low- and high-ionized metal absorptionlines have been identified in 5 absorption line system at z/sub 0/=1.112,2.345, 2.671, 2.992, and 3.200. Moreover, there are tentative evidencesfor the presence of 11 absorption line systems containing only HI L/sub{alpha}//K/sub {beta}/ lines and C IV doublet in the spectrum of S5 0014+81.</TEXT></DOC>
