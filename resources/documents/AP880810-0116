Journal on Dukakis health rumors:   The mental and physical well-being of a presidential candidateis a matter of legitimate public concern.   But the recent episode of the rumored mental problems ofDemocratic candidate Michael Dukakis was mean and petty. ...   The rumors apparently first surfaced in the form of handbillsslipped under reporters' hotel room doors at the DemocraticNational Convention in Atlanta.   The handbills were signed by the ``National Democratic PolicyCommittee,'' an arm of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche. ...   The Democrats need not be surprised. They are trying hard topaint Vice President George Bush as a wimp. ...   If they take delight in that kind of character assault, itshould not surprise them when the opposition returns the favor. ...   If someone has proof that Dukakis is unfit _ let's see it. Andif anybody has evidence that Bush is a weakling _ let's see it.   Until then, those issues are not worth considering.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 8   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on pending legislation calling fora seven-day waiting period for handgun sales:   Polls show that more than 90 percent of the American peoplefavor a waiting period in the purchase of handguns.   Even President Reagan, whose anti-gun control credentials areimpeccable, recently announced his support of a waiting period.   But the National Rifle Association, which automatically opposeseven the mildest of gun regulations as an assault on theconstitutional right to bear arms, is predictably fighting thisamendment as well. And the NRA still has considerable clout inWashington.   Twenty years ago, in the aftermath of a series of politicalassassinations in this country, Congress passed a law prohibitingfelons, minors, illegal aliens, drug addicts and those adjudicatedmentally ill from acquiring handguns.   In states where there is a legal waiting period, hundreds ofsuch persons are stopped from buying guns every year. ...   Clearly a national law is needed.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 7   The Des Moines (Iowa) Register on the need for a rural policy:   Rural America is in trouble, and farming alone will not save it....   Increasingly, ``farm'' and ``rural'' are not one in the same.Having a good farm policy is not the same as having a rural policy.   Rural America is not farms alone. It is people who live in thecountry but who don't farm for a living. ...   The gap between rural and metropolitan America is widening. Muchof rural America is dying of an empty heart. ...   People must stop equating farm policy and rural policy.Politicians must stop trying to solve rural problems with farmprograms. ...   In recognition of the new thinking, the U.S. Department ofAgriculture should be reorganized, refocused and reconstituted as aDepartment of Rural Affairs.   It should be Cabinet level and explicitly dedicated to thewell-being of all 63 million rural Americans, not just the 5million who live on farms.   It should concentrate less on commodities and more on people andcommunities.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 4   Bridgeton (N.J.) Evening News on the Republican convention:   The impending Republican National Convention ... probably willoffer no surprises except the name of the party's vice presidentialcandidate. ...   This political season the big things for both parties, becauseindications are that it will be a close election, are the blackvote, the women's vote and the labor vote.   The Republicans haven't counteracted the (Jesse) Jacksonphenomenon yet but will come up with something.   They have offered a similar day care proposal to that of theDemocrats and the president has agreed to let the labor billproposed by the Democrats pass unchallenged to get labor's support.   The Republicans could have a strong issue if their publicrelations people can get the voters excited about it, which isdoubtful.   But don't expect miracles from the convention.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 8   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on the release ofMathias Rust:   The improbable odyssey of Mathias Rust ended (Aug. 3) when the20-year-old pilot was expelled from the Soviet Union.   Rust stunned the world in May 1987 when he flew a rented Cessnaacross the Soviet border without permission, evaded pursuing jetsand batteries of anti-aircraft missiles and landed safely in RedSquare.   This prank exposed surprising vulnerabilities in Russia'sdefenses and led to the sacking of the Soviet defense minister.   Convicted of hooliganism and other crimes, Rust was to spendfour years in a labor camp.   Once sentenced though, he remained in the relative comfort of aMoscow prison. There he was treated well and given a chance tolearn Russian and a trade.   The Soviets presumably didn't want Rust to leave with any hardfeelings _ or any inclination to join the West German air force.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
