Norman and Eduardo Lachica   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C10</SO><CO>   ALD JAPAN</CO><IN>MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)</IN><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. persuaded Allied-Signal Inc. towithdraw a trade complaint against Japan, at leasttemporarily, while the two countries seek to negotiate asolution.   At issue are complaints by the U.S. company that Japanrestricts imports of amorphous metals, a high-technologyproduct used in electric-power transmission equipment. TheBush administration's decision to negotiate the issue withTokyo, rather than launch a formal trade investigation thatcould lead to retaliation, signals the administration'sintent to reduce the heat of the current trade dialogue withJapan. U.S. officials said the Bush administration doesn'twant to give Japan a black eye so soon after that countryagreed to trade concessions in so-called structuralimpediments talks with the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Although Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, saidnothing about other U.S. trade complaints awaiting action,the tone of her announcement suggested that the White Houseis considering nonconfrontational solutions for them, aswell. At the end of this month, Mrs. Hills has to determinewhether to list Japan as an unfair trading partner under the&quot;Super 301&quot; provision of the 1988 trade act.   Mrs. Hills said that if bilateral negotiations aren'tsuccessful in resolving the amorphous metals dispute within150 days, the U.S. will invite Allied-Signal to resubmit itspetition for prompt action.   In Morris Township, N.J., Edward L. Hennessy Jr.,Allied-Signal's chairman and chief executive officer, saidthe company will cooperate with Mrs. Hills. &quot;The recentlyannounced progress in the trade talks between the U.S. andJapan holds out the promise that trade issues between the twonations can be resolved in a more businesslike and lessconfrontational manner,&quot; he said. &quot;We hope thatAllied-Signal's case will demonstrate that this processworks.&quot;   Allied-Signal filed the trade complaint March 5, allegingthat Japan &quot;has engaged in practices aimed at excluding salesof U.S. amorphous metals.&quot; The U.S. company also charged thatTokyo has blocked attempts to license technology to Japanesecompanies. Mrs. Hills was required under the 1988 trade actto accept or reject the complaint by today.   Mrs. Hills has used similar tactics to deal with tradecomplaints from other U.S. industries. For example, this pastsummer the Shipbuilders Council of America, an industrygroup, withdrew a trade complaint about government subsidiesto commercial shipbuilders in South Korea, Japan, WestGermany and Norway after Mrs. Hills promised that the U.S.would seek to negotiate a broad international agreement torestrict and eventually eliminate such subsidies.   The U.S. negotiations with South Korea and membercountries of the Paris-based Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development on shipyard subsidies haven'tbeen concluded, although U.S. officials say they are makingprogress and the talks should be completed next month.   In its petition, Allied-Signal charged that Japanesegovernment agencies and businesses worked in concert to keepthe company's amorphous metals out of the Japanese marketwhile domestic producers tried to develop an equivalentproduct. Amorphous metals are used primarily to improve theefficiency of electrical transmission and have a world marketestimated at about $1 billion a year.   Mrs. Hills's action drew a cautious reaction fromCongress. Rep. Helen Bentley (R., Md.) said the move was a&quot;Solomon-like decision.&quot; But Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.)warned that the administration could be &quot;falling into apattern of sidestepping U.S. trade law.&quot; He stressed that the&quot;bottom line has to be results in the form of exports for aU.S. firm that is being shut out by Japan.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
