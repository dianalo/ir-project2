<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-1241 </DOCNO><TEXT>Control and monitoring of all Spanish nuclear facilities was first carriedout by the Department of Nuclear Safety of the Junta de Energia Nuclearestablished by the Nuclear Energy Act in 1964. Later, following the exampleof other Western countries, it was concluded that regulations and monitoringof nuclear energy on one hand and its promotion and development on theother should not be done by the same national body. Therefore, the Consejode Seguridad Nuclear (CSN) was created in 1980, as the sole nationalbody responsible for controlling the safety of nuclear installations,and radiological protection. The CSN has five members, one chairman andfour comissioners, required to be independent and therefore with politicallyobjective criteria, internationally acknowledged technical capability,and free from other duties and responsibilities. For this purpose theChairman has been given the status of Minister and the commissionersthat of Secretary of State. They serve for six years, after being acceptedby Parliament by a majority of at least 3/5 of the votes, and are calledupon to report to Parliament at least twice a year on nuclear safetyand radiological protection in the country. A complete report on thoseissues is presented to Parliament, becoming a politic document as fromthat moment. To prepare that report (basically a summary of CSN activities)and, in general, to fulfill all its tasks, the CSN has a staff of some300, about 50% being technical. CSN activities cover: 1. Standards; 2.Licences; 3. Research; 4. Environment; 5. Information; and 6. InternationalRelations.</TEXT></DOC>
