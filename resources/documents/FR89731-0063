L. No. 98-457, section 311, 98 Stat. 1763, 42 U.S.C.A.section 10410 (a) and (b) [1] (West Supp. 1989). The overall purpose ofthis Act is: to demonstrate the effectiveness of assisting states in effortsto prevent family violence and to provide immediate shelter and relatedassistance for victims of family violence and their dependents; and toprovide technical assistance and training in the area of family violenceto states, local public agencies, nonprofit private organizations, andother persons seeking such assistance.42 U.S.C. 10410, Law Enforcement Training and Technical Assistance Grantsand Contracts, authorizes the Department of Justice to provide regionally-basedtraining and technical assistance to personnel of local and state law enforcementagencies in methods for responding to incidents of family violence. Fundsfor these efforts are transferred annually to the Department of Justice,Office of Justice Programs (OJP) from the Department of Health and HumanServices (DHHS), Office of Human Development Services.This announcement applies only to 42 U.S.C.A. section 10410 (a) and (b)[1].A separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>announcement has been developed for section 311,42 U.S.C.A. section 10410 (b)(2)(A), known as the Family Member Abuse Informationand Documentation Project. The term ``family violence'' is defined in 42U.S.C.A. andSection; 10410(1) to mean any act or threatened act of violence,including any forceful detention of any individual which:(A) results or threatens to result in physical injury; and(B) is committed by a person against another individual (including an elderlyperson) to whom such person is or was related by blood or marriage or withwhom such person is or was lawfully residing.The Office for Victims of Crime has received funds from the Departmentof Health and Human Services to administer the Law Enforcement Trainingand Technical Assistance portion of the Family Violence Prevention andServices Act since 1986. In FY 1986, $700,000 was transferred to the Officeof Justice Programs; in FY 1987, $500,000 was transferred; and in FY 1988,$400,000 was transferred. All the funds transferred to OJP, except for$150,000 of funds transferred in FY 1986, have been used for developingand implementing programs and for training law enforcement executives andtrainers. The $150,000 transferred in FY 1986 was utilized by the NationalInstitute of Justice to help support research projects related to law enforcementintervention in domestic violence cases. More specifically, grants have been made to the Victim Service Agency (VSA)of New York City and the National Organization of Black Law EnforcementExecutives (NOBLE) for the following activities.andbullet; Phase I (VSA): During this initial phase of training, law enforcementexecutives were provided with a clear understanding of the causes, natureand appropriate response to family violence. Executives were also assistedin developing effective operational procedures for their agencies throughregional policy development conferences. Law enforcement agencies throughoutthe country were surveyed regarding their family violence policies, practicesand training programs. Information collected was used to develop modeloperational procedures for handling family violence cases, training manualsfor law enforcement executives and policy makers, and a training videotape.andbullet; Phase II (VSA): Phase II was intended to give training officersthe tools to implement effective policies and practices. VSA developedand conducted a training program for law enforcement training officers.A trainers' manual entitled, ``Training and Operational Procedures: A CoordinatedResponse to Domestic Violence'' and a video tape were produced.andbullet; Phase III (NOBLE): Utilizing the material produced under the previousgrants, NOBLE has conducted regional training for state and local law enforcementexecutives and mid-level managers. This training will conclude in January1990.Law enforcement training provided thus far under the auspices of the FamilyViolence Prevention and Services Act has had a significant impact. To date,training has been provided to approximately 1200 persons, representing450 law enforcement agencies. A survey of the departments that have beentrained indicates that of those that responded to the survey (58), 45 ofthem (78% of the respondents), changed their policies because of the trainingthey received. These jurisdictions affect a population of over 16 millionpeople. Policy changes adopted by these agencies include: development andimplementation of pro-arrest and/or mandatory arrest policies; expansionof victim assistance services; mandated reporting of all domestic violenceincidents; increased community coordination; enhanced on-scene investigation;review and refining of definitions related to domestic violence; and developmentof written policies. However, because the training has focused on broadpolicy issues and has been regional, there has been little opportunityto tailor training to the laws of an individual state.<ITAG tagnum="84">(b) Purpose</ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime is making $360,000 available to organizationsand agencies that have had previous experience in training law enforcementofficers, law enforcement trainers and law enforcement policy makers. Theorganizations selected will be required to develop and implement a trainingprogram for law enforcement policy makers and officers on the most effectiveprocedures and policies for responding to incidents of family violencewithin a given state.<ITAG tagnum="84">(c) Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Applications will be accepted from any organization or agency that hashad experience in training law enforcement policy makers and officers inresponding to family violence incidents. As this program will focus primarilyon training of law enforcement policy makers and developing a trainingcurriculum for line officers within a particular state, the applicant shouldhave experience in and knowledge about the applicable laws in that state.Further, as it is recognized that the amount of funds available for thisprogram cannot address all the training needs of a particular state, preferencewill be given to applicants who demonstrate an investment of non-Federalresources in the development of this program. Resources may be in the formof staff time, utilization of existing training materials and facilities.As competition will be based upon the best possible application, agenciesand organizations representing a single state are encouraged to join togetherin developing an application. No more than one application per state willreceive funding.Since the purpose of the program is to provide training to the maximumnumber of law enforcement officers, preference will be given to state lawenforcement training programs which have an ongoing role in training oflaw enforcement personnel.<ITAG tagnum="84">(d) Program Description</ITAG>Approximately six projects will be funded. Each project must focus primarilyon the training and policy development needs of an individual state. However,while focusing on the needs of an individual state, the training programshould be broad enough so that law enforcement officials from neighboringstates who wish to attend will benefit from the training.The Office for Victims of Crime does not want to duplicate existing trainingefforts in a particular state. The goal is to ensure that the informationthat has been developed under previous grants is utilized and made morerelevant to specific state circumstances.Under this program we are requesting the applicants to review their currentfamily violence training program and either update, modify, expand and/orsupplement their current law enforcement family violence training curricula.Each program should contain, at a minimum, the following components:andbullet; Develop and implement a training program for state and local lawenforcement management personnel and policy makers on effective policiesand procedures for responding to incidents of family violence. The programshould include statewide/regional training sessions for sheriffs, chiefsof police and other law enforcement policy makers and mid-level managers.The training sessions should be formatted and tailored to reach as manypolicy makers as possible. Further, in designing the training program theapplicant should consider adapting training material that has been developedunder previous grants or materials which are currently available to thestate. Funds could be used to modify, update, amend, or expand existingtraining documents.andbullet; The curriculum should be applicable to all line law enforcementofficers operating within a particular state. It should utilize currentup-to-date information, procedures and policies. Applicants are enouragedto ensure that all material is consistent with state law and with acceptedlaw enforcement practices regarding intervening in family violence situations.Many of the practices and policies advocated by the Office for Victimsof Crime can be found in the recommendations of the Attorney General'sTask Force on Family Violence and in materials developed by the VictimServices Agency (New York City) under a previous grant. Activities thatwould be acceptable under this portion of the program are:andbullet; Development of short instructional video tapes. The tapes wouldpresent a situation(s) that a law enforcement officer would expect to encounterand would require the officer to take a course of action and explain his/herreasoning for taking this action.andbullet; Revision of the existing training curriculum to incorporate actionswhich need to be taken because of the passage of new family violence relatedlaws.andbullet; Supplementing outdated training material with more relevant andtimely material. Applicants may wish to consider supplementing existingmaterial with computer software tailored to the training needs of law enforcementofficers.andbullet; Rewriting the existing curriculum to make it more specific forline officers. Some training curricula, while appropriate, are too longfor all officers to attend. Reducing existing curricula so that more officerscould benefit from the training would be allowable. andbullet; Develop a plan for ensuring that the line officer training programdeveloped under the auspices of or in conjunction with this grant programis implemented. <ITAG tagnum="84">(e) Selection Criteria </ITAG>In determining which applications to fund, the Office for Victims of Crimewill consider the following: 1.
