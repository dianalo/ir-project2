The pig is tracked bydetecting energy emission resulting from impact of the moving pig withat least two previously identified features which are located withinthe pipeline at known spaced intervals. The energy emission takes theform of vibrational signals which are sensed by a geophone which is coupledexternally to the wall or associated equipment of a gas pipeline. Anelectrical output proportional to the vibration is amplified by a preamplifierand is then filtered by a unit to remove unwanted frequency componentsof the signal. The filtered signal is fed to a chart recorder. The unfilteredpreamplified signl is fed to an audioamplifier where the signal is amplifiedto audible levels.</TEXT></DOC>
