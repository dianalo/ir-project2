The Independent Bankers Association of America, which says thathalf its members are agricultural banks, sent letters to members ofthe Senate and House agricultural committees in support of billsawaiting final action when Congress returns to work on July 26.   A version approved by the Senate committee would providepayments of up to $100,000 to drought-stricken farmers. PresidentReagan has indicated he would sign such legislation.   Association President-elect O. Jay Tomson, Charles City, Iowa,said a special committee concluded that ``the legislation deservesour full support and prompt enactment.''   The legislation would replace a major portion of the income lostby crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought by reallocatingmoney that would otherwise have gone to farmers as ``deficiency''payments to compensate them for low commodity prices.   Drought has cut production and forced up prices, meaning thepayments will be less. Thus, the ``savings'' would be used tofinance the drought benefits.   In addition, livestock, dairy and poultry producers would beprovided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and helpthem keep their foundation stock.</TEXT></DOC>
