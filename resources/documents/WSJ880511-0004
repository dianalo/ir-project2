Under the strategy devised by the industrialized nations for managing the international debt problem, debtor countries that overhaul their economies qualify for more favorable, revised lending packages and new loans from commercial banks. But Mr. Camdessus said this strategy is being undercut by the virtual absence of net new bank loans to Third World countries and frequently protracted loan negotiations.    Moreover, the drive for economic overhaul in heavily indebted countries &quot;risks being interrupted, and even reversed&quot; by the banks' actions, the top IMF chief said in his most outspoken criticism of the banks since his January 1987 appointment. Such overhauls, which the IMF requires for its loans, usually reduce the state's role in the economy and dismantle protectionist barriers.    Mr. Camdessus's attack on the banks comes amid increasing tension between the IMF's biggest shareholder, the U.S. government, and major banks over the issue of international debt and renewed lending to heavily indebted countries.    The U.S. Treasury and international banks have recently clashed over a prospective debt settlement for Brazil. The U.S. Treasury is rebuffing commercial bank demands for World Bank guarantees for about 10% of a planned $5.2 billion bank loan for Brazil. The issue of the guarantees, which major banks have said are necessary to complete the projected loan for Brazil, has held up that country's proposed debt settlement.    Mr. Camdessus's criticism of the banks, made in a speech last night at London's City University Business School, reflects a fear of widespread loan defaults if the Third World debt strategy unravels. Despite the recent buildup in loan-loss reserves by major banks, defaults by developing countries still could hurt the banking system, and could even threaten the financial system in many industrialized countries.    Defaults also would cut off parts of the Third World from private credit sources and damage global trade. Moreover, industrialized nations face growing demands for a global solution to the debt crisis, involving mandatory debt relief and government bailouts. &quot;Calls for alternative solutions are, in fact, multiplying,&quot; the IMF official said.    The current strategy, by contrast, deals with the problems of debtor nations on a case-by-case basis and has always rejected mandatory relief. In recent years, commercial banks have retired or reduced some of the debt with debt-for-equity swaps or bond-for-debt issues. Last night, Mr. Camdessus urged the banks to pursue more such arrangements. &quot;We look to banks, working with the indebted countries, to advance this process,&quot; he said.    Mr. Camdessus said it was clearly in banks' own interest to lend more and &quot;strengthen the value of (their) existing loan claims.&quot;    ---   Peter Truell in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
