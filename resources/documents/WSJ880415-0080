As the battle enters its final days, Gillette executives and Coniston strategists are manning phones and criss-crossing the country to plead their cases to big shareholders. On Wall Street, takeover experts and speculators are poring over several scenarios, including a Coniston-backed takeover by a third party, if New York-based Coniston gains the four Gillette board seats it seeks.    But for all the behind-the-scenes activity, no one involved in the fray seems willing to predict victory for either side. &quot;The voting looks very close,&quot; confided a Gillette source. &quot;I'd have to call it a tossup.&quot;    Coniston's two-month-old fight to force Gillette's sale has been overshadowed by a wave of corporate mergers. The contest has been free of much of the bitterness and name-calling of other proxy fights. And until Gillette filed a lawsuit against Coniston yesterday, &quot;it's been almost genteel,&quot; said Augustus Oliver, one of Coniston's three principal partners.    While a number of major consumer goods concerns have examined possible bids for Gillette, no bidder has surfaced. Ronald O. Perelman, the tenacious raider whose overtures Gillette has rebuffed four times, remains intensely interested, but so far has declined to get involved in the fray.    Interviews with major Gillette shareholders -- mostly investment and pension fund managers -- show strong sentiment for the investment firm's campaign to force Gillette's sale. &quot;They've been fighting off these takeover offers, (but) a takeover can be in the best interest of a stockholder,&quot; said Janice Tester, a money manager at the California State Teachers Retirement Fund, a big Gillette holder. Top Gillette executives &quot;paid us a visit, but we weren't happy with what they had to say,&quot; Ms. Tester added.    Arbitragers, who hold about 15% of Gillette's stock and remain incensed at the company's repeated rejections of Mr. Perelman, generally also can be counted on to vote against management.    But whether any anti-Gillette feelings of other holders translate into pro-Coniston votes is far from certain. &quot;We've had several discussions with analysts (at money management firms) that say, 'I'm for you, but I have to go with upper management,'&quot; which prefers Gillette, said Coniston's Mr. Oliver.    Mr. Oliver acknowledged that Gillette has been a tough opponent. The company's management is well-connected, and at least two big New York banks changed their vote to Gillette after initially going with Coniston, he said. &quot;We've got the level of support that's encouraging, but you really don't know what will happen until you've seen the cards,&quot; Mr. Oliver added.    In a suit filed in federal court in Boston, Gillette charged that Coniston violated federal securities laws by not disclosing &quot;hidden&quot; partners and only partially disclosing Monday a &quot;web of interests behind its shell investment vehicles.&quot; The suit asks the court to void proxies obtained by Coniston as a result of any misleading solicitations, among other things.    Mr. Oliver said the suit is &quot;totally without merit. It's a last-ditch effort to win in the courts what (Gillette) can't win with shareholders.&quot;    Other defendants include Michael F. Price, president of Heine Securities Corp., which owns nearly 2.4 million Gillette shares. The suit said Mr. Price is a limited partner of Coniston, but Coniston hasn't identified him as member of its group in the Gillette fight. A spokesman for Mr. Price said he wasn't available for comment.    Is there a buyer out there? Coniston and many arbitragers insist there is, citing high prices paid in recent takeovers. But some investment bankers, including those who have examined the company for a possible takeover, aren't so sure.    &quot;This is the single most-shopped company in the world over the last two years,&quot; said the head of mergers at one major brokerage. &quot;Everybody and their mother has looked up and down it until their head spins. I talked to one company the other day that had just finished looking at it for a third time.&quot;    Gillette's Wall Street advisers, led by top takeover lawyer Joseph Flom and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s merger chief, Eric Gleacher, contend Coniston's inability to flush out a buyer for Gillette hurts its chances of winning the proxy fight. &quot;Everybody thought they had a rabbit to pull out of their hat at the end,&quot; said one adviser. &quot;But so far we've seen nothing.&quot;    The one sure buyer for Gillette is the only buyer who can't currently buy it. Mr. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc., is prevented from launching a hostile bid for the company by the terms of a standstill agreement he signed with Gillette 18 months ago. Wall Street sources close to Revlon say Mr. Perelman still wants the company through a friendly merger, but doesn't want to pay the steep price -- at least $55 a share -- some analysts believe the company can fetch in a takeover.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Gillette shares closed at $41, down $3.375, in a general market decline.    &quot;Ronnie would love this company, but not at any price,&quot; said a person familiar with Mr. Perelman. Moreover, tax-law changes that went into effect Jan. 1 have made selling off pieces of Gillette, such as its Braun electric appliances and Papermate pen units, as much as $5-a-share more expensive, Wall Street takeover professionals estimate.    Takeover experts have speculated that Gillette immediately would seek a friendly merger partner if Coniston wins. While Gillette advisers deny that, a Coniston victory would pressure Gillette Chairman Colman Mockler Jr. at least to restructure.    If so, Mr. Mockler would have perhaps a month to formulate a plan before Coniston's nominees formally become directors and integral participants in any restructuring discussions.    For Gillette shareholders, the fight represents a classic case of short-term vs. long-term interests. A vote for Coniston probably means a takeover or restructuring, and a quick profit. A Gillette victory almost certainly would send the company's stock plunging, possibly to as low as $30, analysts predict.    &quot;It's more to our advantage to vote for Coniston, (but) Gillette's management has done a good job,&quot; said Tony Gray, a portfolio manager for Sun Banks of Florida, who said he's torn over how to vote. &quot;If Gillette wins the stock, it might go up to $55 a share in about two years. If Coniston wins, it will hit $55 in two months.&quot;    To persuade investors to keep the faith, Gillette is painting a relentlessly positive outlook. Earnings, up sharply in the first quarter, should rise at least 12% a year in coming years, the company predicts. </TEXT></DOC>
