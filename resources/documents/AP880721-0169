Restoring peace and human rights to that country ``can still beaccomplished in an enlightened and competent and honestadministration,'' Carter said.   Carter spoke at a luncheon for Hispanic and Native Americandelegates to the Democratic National Convention at his newpresidential libary.   ``We could have had peace in Nicaragua long ago, we could havehad a death of communism in Nicaragua long ago, and an enhancementof freedom and democracy in Nicaragua long ago had the UnitedStates government worked with our other democratic friends in thishemisphere,'' Carter said.   The Reagan administration has sought to undermine the MarxistSandinista government of Nicaragua by financing the Contra rebels.   Carter said the United States should support democracy and humanrights, but not intrude in its neighbors' affairs.   ``It's contrary to my philosophy for us to try to impose our ownwill or to give advice to our neighbors to the south,'' he said.``They are just as competent as are residents of my own nation tomake decisions about the future.''   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said Carter had conducted a fardifferent foreign policy in Central America than Reagan.   ``There was a time when the United States did not mine harbors,a time when our government did not deal with drug lords, a timewhen our government did conduct foreign policy with dummy companiesand White House conspiracies,'' said Richardson.   Carter said Jesse Jackson told him that all he wants fromMichael Dukakis is the same close relationship minority leadersenjoyed with Carter.   The former president said he never made a major campaign orWhite House decision without consulting them. Their ``politicalsupport was absolutely crucial to my success,'' he said.   ``And when you arrived at the White House, you found top staffmembers and members of my Cabinet who understood your problems andwould listen to your voice,'' said Carter.   He said he now sees the same relationship evolving ``in itsinitial stages at this convention. It's not a concession on thepart of Dukakis and his people. It's a great reaching out and anadditional asset to him.''   Richardson, noting much is made of Dukakis' fluency in Spanish,recalled that as governor of Georgia, Carter once addressed anOrganization of American States meeting in Spanish.   Yes, laughed Carter, but ``I don't think either the Latincontingent or the Americans could understand what I said.''</TEXT></DOC>
