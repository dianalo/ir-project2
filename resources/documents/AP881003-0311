(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A contract settlement between Deere andamp; Co.and the United Auto Workers will likely serve as a pattern forfuture talks between the UAW and Caterpillar Inc., a unionspokesman says.   The tentative agreement reached Saturday averted a threatenedstrike by more than 13,000 employees at Deere, the nation's leadingfarm-machinery manufacturer. Details of the pact weren't released.   As the Deere talks reached their final hours, negotiators forCaterpillar and the UAW in Bridgeton, Mo., agreed Friday to extendtheir contract indefinitely and recess talks pending the outcome ofDeere bargaining.   ``Until the pact with Deere and the UAW is ratified, I wouldn'texpect to see any change in our status,'' Caterpillar spokesmanMark Polzin said.   Caterpillar talks had muddled along for two months before theparallel negotiations with Deere resulted in a tentative contract.   Deere was chosen as the target for a settlement or strikebecause union officials believed they had a better opportunity forcontract gains there.   Elliott Anderson, a chief UAW negotiator in the Caterpillartalks, said the union likely would use the Deere contract as apattern for future talks with Caterpillar.   Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-movingequipment, with 58,800 employees, could face renewed union demandsfor job security, a reduction in overtime, call-back of 1,000 UAWmembers on layoff and the first merit pay increase in a decade.   The union reportedly has been seeking a three-year pact and a 3percent wage increase in each year.   Caterpillar wants to hold down costs and is seeking moreflexibility in job assignments and scheduling, and wants torestrict employee mobility and save money on retraining.   If talks break down, either side can terminate the contract withfive days' notice and Caterpillar could face a strike by 17,500blue-collar workers at plants in 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa,Pennsylvania, Colorado and Tennesse.</TEXT></DOC>
