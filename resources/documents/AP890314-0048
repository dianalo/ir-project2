A Japanese warlord, likewise, will be ending his long exile fromthe history books.   The Education Ministry says the curriculum changes will helpyoungsters understand what it means to be Japanese.   But some Japanese object, saying they consider the flag andanthem symbols of the country's militaristic past. They say thechanges merely revive the trappings of imperialism, not the truthbehind it.   The debate over the new curriculum represents yet another chapterin Japan's struggle to deal with its past, a struggle heightened bythe death of Emperor Hirohito, whose 62-year reign encompassed bothwar and resurgence.   The curriculum, to be phased in from 1990 to 1994, requiresteachers to hoist the Rising Sun flag and have students sing theanthem at such events as graduation ceremonies.   Neither the flag nor the anthem ``Kimigayo'' has any legalstanding.   The Rising Sun is flown in public less than the Stars and Stripesis in the United States, and many schools do not follow the currentguideline that only suggests the anthem be sung and a flag-raisingceremony be held.   The anthem was formerly considered a prayer for the emperor'slong life. Now the ministry says the song seeks ``the Japanesepeople's prosperity centered around the emperor.''   ``It is important to nurture (a child's) identity as aJapanese,'' says Education Minister Takeo Nishioka. ``Unlesschildren have understanding and respect for their national flag andnational anthem, they will not even have the manners to pay respectto the flag and anthem of other countries.''   Masami Yamazumi, an education professor at Toritsu University,complained that a school's mission should be to teach meaning andhistorical background and not to force students to salute the flagand sing the anthem.   Schools have not taught such things or the negative side of theemperor _ his wartime role, for example, he said.   ``Truth must be taught to prevent history from repeating itself.It's regrettable that many schools ignore Japanese modern history,though that's the most important part,'' Yamazumi added.   Japan's failure to specify its wartime aggression in historytextbooks has angered other Asian nations, and their protests haveforced the Education Ministry to revise the texts.   Takahiro Miura of the liberal Japan Teachers' Union said the newcurriculum is imperialistic because it fails to admit aggression,and the union will urge the ministry to delete the controversialelements.   About 30 groups throughout the nation also have submittedpetitions with more than 20,000 signatures objecting to the flag andsong.   The liberal Tokyo Teachers Association said only 670 of 1,700Tokyo schools set up mourning flags for the six days suggested bythe government after Hirohito's death on Jan. 7.   The association's Ikuya Nishikawa admitted, however, that evenliberal teachers have seldom discussed the emperor in class, partlybecause of concern over possible attacks from pro-emperor rightists.   The Education Ministry's curriculum also is adding acontroversial military hero _ Admiral Heihachiro Togo, whose shipssank the Russian fleet in 1905 _ to a list of notable figures to bestudied in sixth-grade history classes.   Togo, known for unquestioning loyalty to emperor and country,became a non-person in postwar education because of his militaristicconnotations.   Nishioka says Japan's strength and international position wereheightened by victories in the 1894-95 Sino-Japanese War and the1904-05 Russo-Japanese War.   ``What would have happened to Japan if it had lost theRusso-Japanese War?'' he asked. ``It can be said that this was avery crucial event affecting the survival of Japan.''   Literature Professor Tomitaro Karasawa notes that in Japan'sWorld War II-era curriculums, almost 38 percent of an ethicstextbook and 76 percent of a Japanese language text was militaristicand imperialistic.   A poem in a 1918 textbook read: ``Great Japan, Great Japan, we 70million people respect His Majesty the Emperor as god, as father andwe must serve him.''   After Japan lost the war, the Education Ministry ordered teachersto have students ink out such material.</TEXT></DOC>
