Only the late Merle Fainsod of Harvard could be considered his equal. Mr. Schapiro's two monumental and seminal works, &quot;The Origins of the Communist Autocracy&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Communist Party of the Soviet Union&quot; (1960) are unsurpassed classics. In them, Mr. Schapiro swept away the romantic haze that obscured the Bolshevik Revolution, the birth of the U.S.S.R., the Soviet Communist Party, and Lenin himself. Now his essential essays have been collected by Ellen Dahrendorf in &quot;Russian Studies&quot; (Viking, 400 pages, $24.95).    Mr. Schapiro was born in Glasgow in 1908 and spent his childhood in Riga and St. Petersburg, where he was witness to the Russian Revolution. He returned to London at the age of 12, eventually studied law and practiced in England for 16 years.    He belongs to the generation of Russian historians who were born to the upheavals of the revolution. They knew the conflict in their bones, and came to set the guidelines for our understanding of Marxism and Bolshevism. It was a generation of giants -- B.D. Wolfe, Isaiah Berlin, David Dallin, Boris Nikolaefskii -- and unfortunately, almost all are now gone. The succeeding generation, for the most part, lacks their gut knowledge and vision.    In Mr. Schapiro's time it was considered commonplace to be well versed in four to five languages. His mastery of Russian, Polish, German and French allowed him to study Russia and Europe. Initially strongly &quot;drawn towards the right,&quot; Mr. Schapiro was influenced by T.S. Eliot, Jacques Maritain and the American poet John Crowe Ransom. The Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset, Mr. Schapiro wrote, &quot;opened my eyes to the fact that we were entering an era in which the established hierarchies were breaking down before the onslaught of the rude and unlettered masses.&quot;    But Mr. Schapiro fell away from the extreme right. &quot;What cured me of right-wing leanings was the Spanish Civil War and the rise of Hitler,&quot; he wrote, appalled by the excesses and brutality of Fascism. But he differed from his intellectual peers in that &quot;one thing Fascism didn't do to me: incline me toward Communism. . . . I became concerned that the only sure way is by a slow process of adaptation and evolution.&quot;    In his work, Mr. Schapiro clearly distinguished the Russian Revolutionary movement from the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, rejecting in the process the historical explanations of Western Marxist and liberal historians who saw the Bolshevik Revolution as popular, democratic and inevitable. He demonstrated that the Bolshevik takeover was not a mass movement or a popular uprising, but a ruthless &quot;coup d'etat.&quot;    The Russian Revolution, or the Bolshevik coup, as Schapiro rightly calls it, was a product of a single person, and Mr. Schapiro devoted much of his attention to Lenin in explaining the origins of the Communist autocracy and the foundation of Bolshevism. Lenin, who established the party-state role model that has inspired all communist parties since, was a determined, power-oriented revolutionary. His ideas were derived from 19th-century Russian militant, anti-democratic populism and nihilism. Mr. Schapiro's analysis of Lenin's intellectual origins is one of the finest pieces in this collection. He shows how Lenin combined the militancy of the populists and the radicalism of the Marxist materialists to become the true organizer of the revolution. Mr. Schapiro clearly shows Lenin's talent for undermining and circumventing the power of apparently overwhelming majorities, which was a crucial element in the triumph of Bolshevism.    Mr. Schapiro is also completely successful in refuting the notion that Lenin's revolution, had he lived, would have become more tolerant. The instruments of arbitrary rule -- the gulags, the secret police, the suppression of opposition, the destruction of the peasantry -- all began with Lenin. The only difference between Lenin and Stalin were differences of style.    &quot;Russian Studies&quot; is the vintage Schapiro, covering the wide range of his endeavors and interests, including a superb essay on Richard Pipes's seminal biography of Lenin's liberal antagonist, Peter Struve, regarded by many &quot;as the most luminous intellect of his generation in Russia.&quot; Mr. Schapiro also writes brilliantly about Turgenev, whom he calls &quot;the greatest writer of Russian prose of all time&quot;; Herzen, who wanted Russia to avoid the &quot;repellent path of Western Capitalism&quot; and thereby influenced Lenin perhaps even more than Marx; and Solzhenitsyn, whom Mr. Schapiro aptly calls the Gibbon of Stalinist Russia. Solzhenitsyn, Mr. Schapiro predicts, &quot;is destined to rank as one of the most remarkable human spirits of this generation.&quot; And Mr. Schapiro is the man best qualified to make that judgment.    ---   Mr. Perlmutter is professor of political science at American University and editor of The Journal of Strategic Studies. </TEXT></DOC>
