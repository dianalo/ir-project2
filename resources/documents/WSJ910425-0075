But in Japan, it has become abuzzword for another perceived victim of the war: U.S.-Japanrelations.   Officials in Tokyo say Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu'smeeting with President Bush in Newport Beach, Calif.,tomorrow is designed to mend ties.</LP><TEXT>   Many Japanese are painfully aware their nation's imagetook a beating in the U.S. because Japan didn't send men tothe war. While Japanese views of Japan's proper role in thewar varied widely, there's broad agreement that goodrelations with the U.S. must remain the cornerstone ofJapanese foreign policy.   Since Mr. Kaifu brings with him no specific proposals forsettling any of the outstanding trade issues between the twonations, it's not clear whether the meeting will makeAmericans feel any warmer toward Japan. But for the primeminister, whose supposed ability to get along with Mr. Bushhas been a big selling point at home, the visit is at least achance to counter frequent Japanese press comments that Mr.Kaifu was conspicuously not included in recent U.S.consultations with its allies, despite Japan's $11 billioncontribution to the multinational forces.   Mr. Kaifu will reaffirm Japan's willingness to help repairenvironmental damage in the Persian Gulf and cooperate inMiddle East diplomacy, including efforts to restrain armssales to the region.   On trade issues, Mr. Kaifu won't come bearing any gifts,according to foreign ministry officials.   Rice, the issue that is sorest at the moment, is toosensitive domestically for Mr. Kaifu to tackle before Japan'sApril 7 local elections. Despite Japan's official insistenceon its policy of banning imports, political leaders here areprepared to accept some limited opening of Japan's ricemarket to imports once the U.S. and Europe narrow theirdifferences over farm trade in multinational trade talksunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Butofficials here continue to say that Japan won't make anymajor initiatives before the end of May, when the U.S.Congress will decide whether to extend the so-calledfast-track negotiating authorization considered crucial toU.S. participation in the talks.   U.S. officials complain that Japan, with its big stake inworld trade, should be willing to take more of a risk to pushthe GATT talks forward. But Japanese officials worry that ifthey give on the rice issue too soon, they'll squander anyleverage they might have to secure some ultimate limits onrice imports.   Many Japanese think U.S. anger over Japan's refusal toallow U.S. rice growers to exhibit small quantities of theirproduct at a recent Tokyo trade fair have unfairly obscuredthe broader picture. Japan buys more U.S. agriculturalproducts than any other nation in the world -- some $8.16billion worth, or 20% of total U.S. farm exports in 1989,according to U.S. government statistics.   While rice remains a symbolic and emotional issue, theJapanese are quietly fretting about a more substantial sourceof trade friction: Japan's huge surplus in car and auto-partstrade. Although the Bush administration has dismissedChrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's call for restrainingJapan's U.S. market share, Mr. Bush mentioned the problems ofthe U.S. auto industry in a March 21 meeting with JapaneseForeign Minister Taro Nakayama, according to a foreignministry official. That was the same day that Mr. Bush metwith chairmen of the Big Three U.S. auto makers.   Autos and auto parts accounted for more than $28 billionof Japan's $90 billion in exports to the U.S. last year.Meanwhile, cars accounted for a mere $685 million of the $52billion in merchandise the U.S. shipped to Japan.   Japan's global trade surplus shrank to $52.4 billion lastyear, continuing a steady decline from its 1986 peak of$82.74 billion, measured when goods pass through Japanesecustoms. But the surplus has begun to expand again this yearand many economists expect the trend to continue in comingmonths.</TEXT></DOC>
