Disney, once referred to sneeringly around the Disney Studios lot as Walt's &quot;idiot nephew,&quot; has shown his former critics he's a smart money player.    The $40-a-share bid for Polaroid Corp. announced yesterday by Mr. Disney's investment company, Shamrock Holdings Inc., is only the latest in a string of financial maneuvers that have catapulted the reticent man to prominence in the past five years, on Wall Street and at the entertainment company co-founded by his uncle, Walt Disney, and father Roy O. Disney.    Together with business adviser Stanley P. Gold, who serves as president and chief executive officer of Shamrock, Mr. Disney, 58 years old, engineered the 1984 ouster of an entrenched, sluggish management at Disney and the appointment of current Chairman Michael Eisner and President Frank G. Wells. The Eisner-Wells team, together with Mr. Disney as vice chairman and head of the animation department, have brought quarter after quarter of record profits to Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co.    In 1985, Shamrock bought Central Soya Co., then turned around and sold the company at a profit of about $125 million two years later. Shamrock earlier this year failed with its $92 million tender offer for Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., but in April it agreed to buy the smaller Music Plus music and video retailing chain.    All this wizardry from a man who literally couldn't stomach the financial aspects of being an entertainment mogul?    &quot;Roy isn't a financial man at all,&quot; says his wife of 33 years, Patricia. &quot;But he figured he needed to know about it, and years ago, at Disney (Studios), he asked his dad if he could work in the accounting department. He used to come home from work every night and throw up.&quot;    Almost everyone, Mr. Disney included, credits Mr. Gold, a former entertainment-law specialist, for devising Shamrock's financial strategies. Mr. Gold attends Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s annual &quot;junk bond&quot; conferences each year on behalf of Shamrock, while Mr. Disney has attended only once, a spokesman says. But it is Mr. Disney who is the creative force behind Shamrock's business transactions.    &quot;I seem to be a lot of times a resident philosopher,&quot; says Mr. Disney, who serves as Shamrock's chairman. Mr. Disney formed the company in 1978 and acquired Starr Broadcasting Group Inc. At one time or another the television and radio concern has had holdings in various broadcasting, agriculture, advertising and oil-field services businesses. The name &quot;Shamrock&quot; is a reference to his and his wife's Irish roots, and was also the name of a green boat they owned.    Roy Disney ranks high in Forbes magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, in recent years weighing in with a reported net worth of $400 million.    &quot;There's probably no one who's more responsible for the success of the Disney company today than Roy Disney, who brought in Eisner and Wells,&quot; says Erwin Okun, Walt Disney Co.'s vice president, corporate communications.    The praise contrasts sharply with the derision Mr. Disney often met in earlier years at the studio, when former management was said to perceive him as an ineffectual executive and director. The heirs of Walt and Roy O. Disney were engaged in a power struggle at the time. And the rift was exacerbated by the continual promotion of Walt Disney's son-in-law, Ronald Miller, who eventually became chief executive.    Mr. Disney says he was aware of the &quot;idiot nephew&quot; comments made about him, although they weren't &quot;made to my face.&quot; He adds, magnanimously, &quot;I think it was some people's way of saying 'don't listen to him.' Although I think they've rethought that now.&quot;    Roy E. Disney left the company in 1977, citing management's inability to come up with films that were critically acclaimed or financially successful.    By 1984, Disney Studios was at the mercy of corporate raiders. It had been battered by a string of box-office bombs, the result of too much attention paid to the company's theme park operations and too little to motion picture and animation production -- which Roy Disney has always believed was the core strength of the company. It was then that Mr. Disney made his move.    &quot;He's a very goal-oriented guy. He's got a determined streak,&quot; says Cliff Miller, Mr. Disney's spokesman and a long-time associate.    Today, Walt Disney Co.'s animation department, under Mr. Disney's guidance, is turning out a new animated feature at least every 18 months -- instead of every four-to-five years, as under former management. Filmmaking has long been a love of Mr. Disney, who started at the studio making documentary films about wildlife.    An avid yachtsman -- somewhat surprisingly known for his salty tongue -- Mr. Disney has his office at the studio decorated in a nautical theme. Perhaps not so surprising for someone working at a leisure-related company, he prefers wildly colored Hawaiian print shirts and deck shoes to suits and ties.    Says Mrs. Disney: &quot;When he wears a suit to the office, his secretary asks him who died.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
