Once their retirement money arrived at TIAA-CREF, the nation's largest private pension plan, the professors' investment options were almost as easy: It could go into a fixed-income fund or an equities fund. Once it went into the fixed-income fund, it could never leave. If it went first into equities and then moved into fixed income, it couldn't return to equities.    These restrictions, along with others on redeemability and governance of the pension fund, have provoked so much controversy in the academic community recently that TIAA-CREF has taken steps to placate its constituents. In a draft proposal released yesterday, the fund said it would allow its one million members to choose among six CREF funds instead of one and allow them to transfer future contributions more easily among funds. But it still won't allow them to move money out of TIAA-CREF.    To the employees of colleges, universities and other nonprofit academic organizations who have been demanding more discretion over their retirement funds, TIAA-CREF's proposal is a feeble effort. &quot;In one sense it's a great victory,&quot; says Roy A. Schotland, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center and an active opponent of TIAA-CREF's current policies. &quot;But in another sense it's a terrible disappointment. I pray it doesn't take a lawsuit to bring them around.&quot;    Criticism of TIAA-CREF centers on its refusal to let its constituents move their money freely between equities and fixed-income securities or transfer it into a mutual fund or other retirement vehicle. TIAA-CREF says there are &quot;very substantial legal and administrative obstacles to transferability.&quot; But in its proposal the pension plan said it would conduct a &quot;vigorous and creative exploration&quot; of ways to overcome those obstacles.    &quot;Three years and two studies and they say they'll study the issue,&quot; grumbles Mr. Schotland. &quot;It's the height of arrogance.&quot;    Furthermore, TIAA-CREF's proposals apply only to future contributions to the plan and not to any of its current $63.3 billion in assets. To older professors, the new plan would hardly change things. &quot;My wife and I have been using the plan for almost 20 years, and that money is as locked in as it has ever been,&quot; says Michael D. Gordon, professor of history at Denison University. &quot;They're just trying to hold on to their quasi-monopoly.&quot;    TIAA-CREF was founded in 1918 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Until the late 1970s, when the mutual-fund industry began making small inroads on campuses, it was virtually the only option available to the academic community. Today, colleges and universities can choose between enrolling their employees in TIAA-CREF exclusively, or providing the employees with the choice of TIAA-CREF or an alternative. Some 3,800 educational institutions participate in TIAA-CREF, and about 175 offer alternative investment choices.    The five proposed new CREF funds are: a market-to-market bond fund, a balanced fund with holdings in stocks, bonds and money-market instruments; an actively managed equities fund; a passive equities fund, and an international equity fund. In addition, a new fixed-income fund has been proposed, to be called TIAA II. Participants would be able to transfer future contributions freely among all CREF funds and the TIAA II fund.    The controversy surrounding TIAA-CREF has heated up in recent months after the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that CREF had applied for exemptions from mutual-fund regulations. CREF had registered with the SEC, and applied for exemptions, because it wanted to offer a money-market option to its constituents. Among other things, CREF asked to be exempt from the SEC rule that allows investors to cash in their shares within seven days.    A number of professors, universities and mutual-fund companies as well as the Commission on College Retirement, an independent body that reviews college and university retirement programs, denounced the exemptions and asked that the SEC hold hearings on CREF's application. The SEC has not yet issued a decision on whether hearings will be held. </TEXT></DOC>
