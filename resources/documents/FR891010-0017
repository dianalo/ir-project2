L. Hubbs and his family (Hubbs <T3>et al. </T3>1974). It was not recognized as a unique form of speckleddace until 1972 when Drs. Hubbs and Miller described it as a subspeciesendemic to two springs in Clover Valley, Elko County, Nevada (Hubbs andMiller 1972). The Independence Valley speckled dace was not collected untilAugust 25, 1965. It was also described by Drs. Rubbs and Miller in 1972as a distinct subspecies of speckled dace found only in Independence Valley(Hubbs and Miller 1972, Hubbs <T3>et al. </T3>1974).Speckled dace are members of the minnow family of fishes (Cyprinidae) thatoccupy many waters of western North America. They are able to occupy awide variety of habitats ranging from cold streams and rivers with rockysubstrates to small thermal springs with silt substrates. Their adaptabilityto a broad range of environments has allowed them to persist in habitatstoo harsh for the survival of many other fish species. Isolation of populationshas permitted genetic divergence and resulted in a number of morphologicallydistinct forms recognized as subspecies. Their diet consists primarilyof insects, and their maximum length rarely exceeds 4 inches.Speckled dace are distinguished from other minnows by, among other characters,the shape and arrangement of pharyngeal teeth (usually slightly curvedand hooked in a 1, 4-4, 1 formula) and the presence of well developed radiicompletely around the scales. Coloration is typically olive-green on theback fading to silver/gold on the abdomen. As the vernacular name suggests,black spots may be randomly arranged over the body. A distinct black lateralstripe usually extends from the forebody to the caudal fin.The Clover Valley speckled dace and Independence Valley speckled dace arebelieved to be derived from an ancestral form of speckled dace similarto the Lahontan speckled dace <T3>(Rhinichthys osculus robustus</T3>) presently occupying the HumboldtRiver system in northern Nevada. Both of these speckled daces are distinguishedfrom the Lahontan speckled dace by their less developed lateral line systemon both the body the body and head. The Clover Valley speckled dace isfurther distinguished by the anterior location of its pectoral fins anda lower number of pelvic fin rays (6 versus typically 8 for speckled dace)(Hubbs and Miller 1972). The Independence Valley speckled dace is dwarfedwith a more laterally compressed body than is characteristic of speckleddace. Its lateral line is less developed and its caudal peduncle is deeperand pectoral fin rays fewer than is typical of the Clover Valley speckleddace. It is also distinguished from the Clover Valley speckled dace byits straighter and more oblique mouth (Hubbs and Miller 1972).Both of these speckled dace are restricted to small springs and their outflows.Vinyard (1984) and Hubbs <T3>et al. </T3>(1974) located the Clover Valley speckled dace in smallirrigation impoundments and in ditches radiating from them into irrigatedpasture land. Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> (1974) also recorded the dace in isolated portions of spring-fedstreams located upstream from these impoundments. Vinyard (1984) and Hubbs<T3>et al. </T3> (1974) recorded the Independence Valley speckled dacefrom shallow marshlands spreading away from deep pools associated withspring sources. All habitats of both subspecies are situated on private land supportingranch operations. Neither of these speckled dace have been widespread inhistoric times. Early (1934) collectors did not sample Independence Valley,and located only one Clover Valley speckled dace population (Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> 1974). Subsequent surveys conducted in 1965, however, locatedthe Independence Valley speckled dace and an additional population of CloverValley speckled dace (Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> 1974). Both dace were noticeably scarce when these surveyswere conducted. In 1983, Vinyard (1984) located a third Clover Valley springwhich contained speckled dace.Hubbs <T3>et al. </T3>(1974) attributed the rarity of these speckled dace tohabitat alterations to facilitate irrigation and the presence of rainbowtrout (<T3>Salmo gairdneri</T3>) and largemouth bass (<T3>Micropterus salmoides</T3>) introduced for sport fisheries. Populationsizes of these speckled dace have been known to fluctuate in response tothe presence of these non-native fish species. For example, numerous CloverValley speckled dace were present in a spring-fed impoundment in 1964 thathad recently been stocked with rainbow trout; however, a subsequent surveyof the same locality in 1965 found the dace scarce and restricted to asmall portion of stream near the spring source where they could best avoidrainbow trout (Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> 1974). Vinyard (1984) failed to locate any dace at thissite during several surveys in 1983, although a small number of dace wereagain observed in February 1988.Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> (1974) noted the scarcity of Independence Valley speckleddace in their sole habitat during 1965, the first time this dace was collected.Vinyard (1984) also observed their scarcity and recorded dace only in shallowwater not inhabited by bass and bluegill (<T3>Lepomis machrochirus</T3>). That the presence of bass and bluegillthreatens the Independence Valley speckled dace is evidenced by the extinctionof the Independence Valley tui chub (<T3>Gila bicolor isolata</T3>) following introduction of these two sportfish. This chub was also endemic to this spring.The Clover Valley speckled dace and Independence Valley speckled dace wereincluded as Category 2 candidates for possible listing in a Notice of Reviewof Vertebrate Wildlife for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species(47 FR 58454) published on December 30, 1982. Category 2 candidates arethose for which additional status information is needed before their statuscan be evaluated. In an updated Notice of Review (50 FR 37958) publishedon September 18, 1985, the status of the two speckled dace was changedto Category 1 on the basis of new status information received. The category1 classification means that sufficient status information is availableto indicate the species may warrant listing. A proposed rule to list bothsubspecies as endangered was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 35282) on September 18, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the September 18, 1987, proposed rule and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. On December 2,1987, the original comment period, which closed on November 22, 1987, wasextended to February 1, 1988 (52 FR 45976). Affected landowners and appropriateState agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices were published in the <T3>Elko Daily Freepress</T3> on December 21, 1987, the <T3>Ely Daily Times </T3>on December 22, 1987, and the <T3>High Desert Advocate</T3> on December 30, 1987, which invited generalpublic comment. Two requests for a public hearing were received and a separatemeeting with two landowners was scheduled for February 26, 1988. To accommodatethis meeting and to allow for scheduling a public hearing, the commentperiod was reopened for 60 days on February 24, 1988 (53 FR 5434). A publichearing was held on April 7, 1988, and newspaper notices of the publichearing date, place, and written comment deadline were were published inthe <T3>Elko Daily Freepress</T3> on March 22, 1988, and in the <T3>High Desert Advocate</T3> on March 23, 1988. A total of 23 writtencomments were received and are discussed below. The nine comments receivedat the public hearing, held at Wells High School, 115 Lake Avenue, Wells,Nevada, on April 7, 1988, from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., are also summarized.A total of 23 written letters of comment were received. Of these, 11 commentsof support were received, including the Nevada Department of Wildlife and10 other individuals or groups. Letters voicing neither opposition norsupport were received from 1 Federal Agency, 1 State Agency, a State Assemblyman,and 1 Nevada County. Eight written comment letters opposing listing, 3of which were from affected landowners, and 5 from other individuals orgroups, were received. All 9 speakers at the public hearing opposed listing.An inquiry was received from Senator Chic Hecht concerning a letter hehad received from a Clover Valley landowner who had recently purchasedproperty which included one of the speckled dace localities. The landownerrequested suggestions regarding the listing issue and the planned stockingof bass or catfish in the spring outflow. The Service responded by reiteratingthe reasons why the Clover Valley speckled dace was proposed for endangeredstatus: limited distribution, vulnerability of habitat to change from irrigationor other water diversion practices, and its inability to persist in habitatswhere non-native species have been introduced. The Service's response alsostated that the landowner should contact the Nevada Department of Wildlifefor suggestions are assistance in establishing a fishery, that the Servicedid not normally provide direct assistance for such actions, and that itwas hoped that such action would include measures to protect the dace.Oral statements presented at the public hearing, and written comments receivedduring the comment periods are covered in the following discussion. Commentsof similar content are grouped into a number of general issues. These issues,and the Service's response to each, are discussed below.<T3>Issue 1:</T3> Both subspecies of speckled dace are thriving in theirrespective habitats because of agricultural practices by the private landowners.<T3>Response:</T3> The construction of small reservoirs for agriculturalpurposes at the spring outflows has provided an environment where predatoryand/or completing fishes persist and may become abundant. Several commentletters supporting listing (including the Desert Fishes Council) citedthe disappearance and presumed extinction of the Independence Valley tuichub (<T3>Gila bicolor isolata</T3>) as an example of the threat caused by introducedfishes. In the case of the tui chub, construction of a reservoir inundatedits habitat and permitted exotic fish species to persist that were predatorson the chub.Historical records and field investigations by eminent ichthyologists CarlL. Hubbs and Robert R. Miller (Hubbs and Miller 1972; Hubbs, <T3>et al. </T3> 1974) documented the rarity of both subspecies of speckleddace, and the detrimental effects of habitat alteration and introductionof non-native fishes. Vinyard's field studies in 1983 (Vinyard 1984) furtherindicated the low numbers of both subspecies and the detrimental effectsof irrigation structures and introduced game fish on the native dace populations.Degradation of dace habitat at one Clover Valley site was documented byHubbs <T3>et al.</T3> (1974) by noting the reservoir in 1934 was ``* * * 3 mastersdeep * * * clear water; rather firm, whitish bottom * * *.'' By 1965, howeverthe reservoir was ``* * * largely silted in* * * very easily muddied; bottomnow of deep mud * * *.'' Portions of the present ditched and impoundedhabitats vary from watered to dry depending on irrigation schedules, andprovides only limited habitat during much of the year. Neither the dacenor extent of its habitats were known before widespread agricultural modificationswere completed. It is probable, however, that they occupied all of thestreams and wetlands maintained by local spring discharge. None of theagricultural modifications to habitats have been done to benefit the nativespeckled dace. The fish have persisted, not because of irrigation practicesby landowners, but despite radical modifications to their habitats. Undercurrent management practices the continued survival of the fish cannotbe guaranteed.<T3>Issue 2:</T3> Collections of speckled dace by researchers and/or Servicebiologists have been significant and have constituted a serious threatto population numbers.<T3>Response:</T3> Careful, scientific collection of some individual fishis required occasionally to document species occurrence and abundance.Several comment letters erroneously indicated that large numbers (up to50) of dace from each of several different sites were collected and/ordissected during status survey field work in 1983. In fact, only a totalof approximately 15 individuals were retained from all of the collectionsites. These collections were important since almost 20 years had passedsince the dace's occurrence had been documented in any habitats in Cloverand Independence Valley. Small collections of this type are necessary ona periodic basis to document that the original native types are still present,and to determine whether any non-native types have been introduced. Basedon the habitat areas actually sampled and the inherent difficulty of samplingmarshes and swift streams using net and seines, researchers and Servicepersonnel believe that there are several hundred dace present in each ofthree of the four localities sampled in the two valleys, and that the smallnumber of dace retained for scientific purposes had no effect on populationviability.<T3>Issue 3:</T3> Listing the two speckled daces would constitute a violationof the 5th Constitutional Amendment prohibiting taking of property withoutdue process and just compensation_(<T3>i.e.,</T3> condemnation of land).<T3>Response:</T3> The constitutional issue raised by the commentors cannotbe addressed in this final rule because the Service's determination onwhether to list these species cannot be influenced by non-biological factors.The listing procedure provided by Congress in section 4 of the Act requiresthe Service to base its decision solely upon biological criteria and tradeinformation. <T3>See</T3> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 835, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1982). Oncethe listing process is completed, other procedures exist, either throughsection 7 or section 10 of the Act, to analyze impacts posed by economicactivities to endangered or threatened species. <T3>Issue 4:</T3> Because it has not been documented that numbers of dacehave declined, there is no justification to list these species as endangeredor threatened.<T3>Response:</T3> Documentation of a decline in numbers of individualsor populations is not required for consideration of listing. The Servicehas reviewed prior scientific data and received comments which documentthat spring/marsh habitats where both dace subspecies occur have been radicallyaltered by agricultural practices, and by introduction of predatory speciesof trout, bass, and sunfish. The Endangered Species Act requires that fivespecific factors, one of which is the ``present or threatened destruction,modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range'' be evaluated todetermine whether listing is appropriate. The identified threats to thedace's habitat, inherent small population size, and the limited extentof natural habitat are sufficient justification under the Act to list thetwo subspecies as endangered.<T3>Issue 5:</T3> The Service should have worked with affected landownersto develop a cooperative agreement that would protect the dace and allowagricultural practices to continue.<T3>Response:</T3> A meeting was held between Service representatives andtwo of the affected landowners to discusss development of such an agreement.Both landowners refused to sign any type of agreement and requested theService withdraw the listing proposal based on their promise to continueto provide for the dace's well-being. One of the two landowners statedthat he would like to develop additional irrigation of his ranch and directthe spring flow into two old ditches, which could seriously impact thehistorical stream channel where dace were present in 1983. It is not knownif the fish is still extant at this location. On the second landowner'sproperty, the fishes do continue to survive under present agriculturalmanagement; however, it is apparent that the threats to the long-term survivalof these fish must be addressed in making a decision on whether to listthese subspecies as endangered or threatened. Another landowner has indicatedan intention to introduce game fish into the spring system despite beinginformed of the threats that this action would pose to the native speckleddace. Thus, the Service believes that considerable efforts to date to workwith the landowners has not resulted in any guarantees to eliminate long-termthreats to the daces or their habitats that would justify a decision towithdraw the listing proposal.<T3>Issue 6:</T3> The Service has plans (or should, or should not) to movethe dace into other waters.<T3>Response:</T3> At the present time, the Service has no plans to transplantdace into additional habitats. In 1984, when dace were believed to be absentfrom one historical site in Clover Valley, a researcher suggested thatdace be reintroduced into this habitat from existing populations. Becausesmall numbers of dace were again observed in this historical site in 1988,reintroduction of dace is no longer being considered. Transplanting daceinto Snow Water Lake, as suggested by one commenter, would not provideany secure habitat since the lake occasionally dries completely. Additionally,the Act states that its purposes ``* * * are to provide a means wherebythe ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species dependmay be conserved * * *.'' Thus the primary emphasis in conserving the CloverValley and Independence Valley speckled daces should be directed at insuringthe maintenance of natural spring flows and aquatic habitats.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the Clover Valley speckled dace and theIndependence Valley speckled dace should be classified as endangered species.Procedures found at section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and Regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the fivefactors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their applicationto the Clover Valley speckled dace (<T3>Rhinichthys osculus oligoporus</T3>) and Independence Valley speckleddace (<T3>Rhinichthys osculus lethoporus</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>As presented in the ``Background'' section,several factors have affected the decline of these speckled dace. Neitherthe daces nor their habitats were known before settlers moved into thearea and began manipulating springs to facilitate irrigation. Therefore,precise limits of their historically occupied habitat are unknown. However,information gathered about other dace occupying other springs within northernNevada indicates these speckled dace occupied all of the streams and wetlandsmaintained by local spring discharge. The quantity of habitat was probablynever very large for these dace since the springs they inhabit are small;none of these habitats are supported by springs discharging more than 2,000gallons per minute (Garside and Schilling 1979). Manipulation of habitats downstream from reservoirs relegated dace populationsto the reservoirs and the small section of stream between the impoundmentsand the springs. Initial surveys for the Clover Valley speckled dace in1934 noted that springs occupied by the dace had been altered at a muchearlier date. The outflows were impounded in small reservoirs prior tobeing distributed to various irrigated pastures (Hubbs <T3>et al </T3>1974). The ditched habitats existing down gradient fromthese reservoirs varied from watered to dried depending on where irrigatedlands were situated relative to the location of reservoirs. The variablewater application regime which continues today (Vinyard 1984), prohibitedthe long term presence of dace and their habitat in areas downstream fromthe reservoirs and was probably responsible for the scarcity of dace inthese streams. Viability of dace populations has also been affected by introductions ofnon-native fishes. Hubbs <T3>et al</T3>. (1974) reported low dace populations when rainbow troutwere introduced into reservoirs. Large dace populations were, however,reported at times when trout had not been stocked and were, therefore,scarce or absent. Courtenay and Stauffer (1984) reviewed the detrimentalimpacts of introduced fishes on native fish populations throughout theworld.The manipulation of reservoir levels may also adversely affect dace populationsby effectively decreasing the amount of pond habitat and forcing the fishto take refuge in downstream irrigation ditches. While in these ditchesdace are vulnerable to extirpation when their habitat is dried by watermanagement practices that require continuous changes in the water flowin the ditches being used to irrigate different pastures. The Clover Valley speckled dace presently occurs in three springs and outflowsin Clover Valley (Hubbs <T3>et al</T3>. 1974, Vinyard 1984, McNatt 1988). Vinyard (1984) reportedabsence of dace at one site in 1983, but small numbers were again presentby 1988. Existing populations are restricted to local habitats within impoundmentsand seasonally in their tributary streams (Vinyard 1984). The size of thesepopulations is unknown, but two are believed to exceed several hundredindividuals during the summer when they reach their maximum levels. The Independence Valley speckled dace has never been known to be abundantand always has been known from a single spring system. Hubbs <T3>et al</T3>. (1974) reported the dace were so scarce during their attemptsto collect it in 1965 that it was difficult to locate the number requiredfor taxonomic analysis. Vinyard (1984) confirmed its existence in onlyone spring and noted that the dace were only in those areas not occupiedby largemouth bass and bluegill. Therefore, the dace presently occupiesless habitat than it did in 1965. The limited distribution in habitat occupiedby this speckled dace implies that any increase in ranch operations, whichadversely affects its habitat, is likely to cause the population to decline.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>The small population size and limited distribution of thesefishes makes them vulnerable to deleterious depletion by collection.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Neither of these speckled daces have beenexamined for disease. A number of diseases are known to occur naturallyin other speckled dace populations in the Great Basin; however, these arenot believed to have a substantial impact on population viability. Theestablishment of non-native fishes in these habitats may have providedan avenue for foreign diseases to be introduced. Such introductions ofdisease have occurred in other portions of Nevada. Minckley and Deacon(1968) reported the introduction of foreign parasites into the Moapa Riversystem in southern Nevada which apparently accompanied the establishmentof exotic fishes in the local springs and streams. Analysis of native fishesin the Moapa Valley showed that these parasites have successfully infectedthe local fish community and may be depressing populations. No introducedparasites or diseases are known to infect these two speckled dace.Sport fishes introduced into North America have frequently been reportedas preying upon or competing with native fishes. In many instances, exoticspecies have caused the native fishes to be eliminated (Minckley 1973,Moyle 1976, Taylor <T3>et al. </T3>1984). Extinction of the Independence Valley tui chub followingintroductions of largemouth bass and bluegill is strong evidence that suchintroductions have significantly impacted the native fishes occupying springsin northeastern Nevada. The presence of predatory species in springs occupiedby these two speckled dace is noted as being a major factor depressingtheir populations (Hubbs <T3>et al.</T3> 1974, Vinyard 1984).D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>These speciesare not protected by any known regulatory mechanism.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Vandalous acts have never been known to affect rare aquatic speciesin Nevada; however, threats of vandalism were made that, if carried out,would have reduced or eliminated populations of rare species.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to issue this final rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list both the Clover Valley speckled dace andIndependence Valley speckled dace as endangered. The restricted distributionof these species, and the immediate and potential problems affecting theircontinued existence, indicate that endangered, rather than threatened,is the appropriate classification. Critical habitat is not being proposedfor the reasons discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. With regard to the two speckled dace, theService finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at thistime. As discussed under Factors A, B, and E, in the ``Summary of factorsaffecting the species,'' these fishes are vulnerable to unlawful collectionand vandalism acts. Designation of critical habitat would entail publicationof precise habitat locations, delineating the distribution of these fishesand, therefore, would make the species more susceptible to unlawful collectionand vandalism. All involved parties and landowners will be notified ofthe location and importance of protecting the habitat of these species.Protection of habitat will be addressed through the recovery process andthrough the section 7 consultation process, as explained below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Recoveryactions that may be beneficial to these species include: conservation easementsand consequent effective management of the springs where the fish live,and protective measures to prevent vandalism, habitat disturbance, andintroduction of predatory fish. Specific management actions that mightbe negotiated pursuant to conservation easements with private landownerswould be leaving sufficient water in springs and outflows during irrigationwork, maintaining some vegetation intact in the course of clearing irrigationcanals, and not using herbicides. The protection required of Federal agenciesand the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.The restriction of both dace species to private land indicates that theinvolvement of Federal activities regarding these species will be minimal.Prior to issuing a permit pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act,the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may be required to consult with the Serviceif there are proposed activities that will dredge and fill wetlands occupiedby endangered or threatened species. No other potential Federal activitiesare known to be involved.The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell oroffer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered fish orwildlife species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certainexceptions would apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Courtenay, W.R., Jr. and J.R.
