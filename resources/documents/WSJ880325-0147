The share of earnings soaked up by those taxes is almost five times as large for the poorest families -- those making less than $8,600 -- as it is for the richest, according to a report by Citizens for Tax Justice. This happens because the taxes are applied at a flat rate regardless of income.    In 23 states, the disparity is even worse than the national average. The poor in South Dakota and Mississippi pay about seven times as much of their earnings in sales and excise taxes as do the rich; and in Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana, almost six times as much.    The study focused on general sales taxes and on excise taxes, chiefly those on gasoline and tobacco. It concluded that:   The poorest 20% of four-member families, averaging income of $8,581, paid 5.4% of their earnings in sales and excise taxes last year. The second one-fifth, averaging $20,535, paid 3.9%.; while the third, averaging $31,497, paid 3.3%. The fourth, averaging $44,910, paid 2.9%; and the highest-earning one-fifth, averaging $66,912, paid 2.5%.    The top-earning 5%, averaging $187,316, paid 1.6%. Four-member families averaging $612,122 a year -- the richest 0.7% of Americans -- paid 1.1% of their incomes for sales and excise taxes.    &quot;By relying on nickel-and-dime sales taxes, state governments across the country have quietly heaped an onerous burden on their poorest citizens,&quot; Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, said in releasing the study. &quot;The less you make, the worse you do -- especially in states with heavy taxes on food, utilities, tobacco and fuels.&quot;    The ultimate solution, he said, is for states to rely less on sales taxes and more on income taxes. In the meantime, McIntyre added, sales taxes can be made less onerous by extending rebates to the poor and applying the levies disproportionately to services that are generally used by the well-to-do, such as club memberships and home-improvement services.    The study found that only six states have set up a system of tax credits to reduce the sales-tax burden on the poor. In only one state, New Mexico, would the credit offset as much as half the burden.    Citizens for Tax Justice is a Washington-based research organization that is financed by organized labor and several liberal social groups. The organization considers income taxes more equitable than consumption taxes, including excise and sales taxes, because income taxes generally take a bigger bite of each dollar as income rises and, thus, fall more heavily on upper-income Americans. </TEXT></DOC>
