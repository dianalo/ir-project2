This taxon was thought to be extinct until it wasrediscovered in 1982. The plant is known only to occur on less than 0.01acre of peaty hummocks within a fresh water marsh fed by a perennial springabove the bottom lands of the Sevier River. The single known populationhas experienced a population decline of over 90 percent in the past 5 yearsand now numbers only about 20 individuals. Continued livestock grazingand trampling of the autumn buttercup and its occupied habitat is likelyto cause the extinction of this taxon in the foreseeable future. This proposal,if made final, would implement protection provided by the Act and makeavailable conservation measures implemented by the Act and identify thetaxon as one in need of conservation to groups in and outside of the Federalgovernment. The Service is requesting data and comments from interestedparties on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments from all interested parties must be received bySeptember 20, 1988.

Jones first collected the autumn buttercup in early September1894. Jones' diary for the period indicates ``Orton's Ranch'' as the collectionlocation (Benson 1948). Jones apparently did not describe the taxon (Jones1895). In autumn 1948, Lyman Benson located a grandson of Orton who ledhim to a swampy area along the Sevier River. Benson located a populationand collected specimens from a group of ``15 or 20 small clumps'' in thevicinity of the Jones collection of a half century earlier; from this collectionBenson described <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis </T3>(Benson 1948). Despite Benson's very complete descriptionof the population's location, the taxon was essentially lost for more than30 years (Mutz 1984). The habitat was reported over-grazed in 1960 (Mutz1984), and Ripley (1975) indicated that the taxon was probably extinctbefore 1975. During field work in connection with a review of the genus<T3>Ranunculus </T3>for Utah, Margaret Palmieri was unable to relocatethe autumn buttercup in August of 1974 (Palmieri 1976).On August 23, 1982, Kathryn Mutz located the autumn buttercup in a wetlandabove the Sevier River about 1 mile north of the type location. This newlydiscovered site was revisited by Mutz in 1983 in conjunction with the preparationof a status report for the Service, and 407 adults and 64 seedlings werecounted.The species' habitat is a series of small peaty hummocks on a low knollless than 0.01 acre in size surrounded by a marsh. The knoll may be theresult of a raised peat bog uplifted by the upwelling waters of a springwhich surrounds it. The overflow channel of a nearby spring-fed stock waterpond also runs past the knoll. In 1984, the autumn buttercup was againobserved but had been heavily grazed. In 1985, the habitat was heavilygrazed and trampled; and only eight individuals were counted (Service 1985).In 1986, 14 plants were counted and there had been only moderate grazingin the immediate vicinity of the buttercups (Service 1986). In 1987, 12plants were counted in early August. Three weeks later, the site had beenmoderately grazed, and all the flowering systems had been cropped beforeseed had set (Service 1987).The autumn buttercup apparently has been extirpated from its type locality.Searches by Mutz in 1982 and 1983 (Mutz 1984) and by the Service in 1985,1986, and 1987 have not located any other populations of <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis. </T3>The entire population of the taxon is on lands inprivate ownership.The autumn buttercup is a herbaceous perennial plant normally growing between1 and 2 feet tall. Most of the simple but deeply palmately divided leavesare clustered at the base. Leaves and stems are covered with fine hairs.Leaves with three linear divisions are found high on the flowering stems.Flowers, usually 6 to 10 per plant, are about \1/2\ inch in diameter withfive yellow petals and five reflexed yellow green sepals which fall offsoon after the flower opens. Fruits of the buttercup are achenes. Twentyto forty of these small, dry, one-seeded fruits are clustered on the surfaceof the receptacle of the past flower in the shape of a cylinder or invertedcone from 0.25 to 0.33 inch high. Height of the buttercups at floweringmay apparently be altered by the intensity of grazing; the few plants observedflowering in 1983 were less than 3 inches tall. Seedlings of the autumnbuttercup have small (less than 0.5 inch wide) leaves with three broad,rounded lobes (Mutz 1984).Benson (1948) followed a conservative taxonomic approach in his nomenclaturaldesignations. His publication contained the scientific description andthe naming of the autumn buttercup from the Sevier River Valley of centralUtah as <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis.</T3> In the same publication, Benson indicated that byfollowing a moderate policy in taxonomic determination, it would have beenappropriate to designate the autumn buttercup as a species in its own rightrather than a variety of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> (i.e., <T3>R. aestivalis</T3>). <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> has floral characteristics very similar to typical<T3>R. acriformis</T3> (i.e., petal size and shape), although tending tobe somewhat smaller. Seed characteristics, however, are markedly different,and leaf shape is different, with the lobes of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> being much narrower than the other varieties.Welsh (1986) and Welsh <T3>et al.</T3> (1987) assigned the taxon to <T3>R. acris</T3> as <T3>R. acris</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> based on the more angular lobes of the basal leavesand the short beak of the achene which are typical of <T3>R. acris. R. acris</T3> is native to Europe and Asia with one variety,<T3>R. acris</T3> var. <T3>figidus</T3>, occurring in the Aleutian Islands. Thus, <T3>R. acris</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> would represent a Pleistocene relict population extremelyisolated geographically from the main body of that species' population.Benson (1948) argues that <T3>R. turneri</T3> of the Western American arctic may be a phylogeneticlink between <T3>R. acris</T3> of the old world and the <T3>R. occidentalis</T3> group (including <T3>R. acriformis</T3>) of the new world, with its closest relationshipbeing with <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>montanenis.</T3> Thomas Duncan (personal communication 1987) statedthat his preliminary taxonomic evaluation of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> would align that entity with <T3>R. occidentalis</T3> of the Pacific Northwest and that it appears tobe a species in its own right. <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> represents an important part of scientific understandingof the development of the buttercup genus and its relationships in westernNorth America and eastern Asia.With the apparent extinction of all but one of its populations, an occupiedhabitat of less than 0.01 acre, a total population of about 20 individuals,and a documented population decline of more than 90 percent in its remainingoccupied habitat within the past 5 years, the autumn buttercup is in imminentdanger of extinction.Section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report of those plants considered to be endangered, threatenedor extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service publisheda notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the reportof the Smithsonian Institution as a petition within the Context of Section4 of the Act and of its intention to review the status of plant taxa namedwithin. <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was included on list ``C'' as probably extinct.On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 ofthe Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of commentsand data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in responseto House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication. <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was included in that proposed rule and was marked withan asterisk to denote it as a species for which the Service especiallydesired information on living specimens and extant populations. Commentsreceived in response to the 1976 proposal were summarized in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 26, 1978 (43 FR 17909). The EndangeredSpecies Act Amendments of 1978 required that all proposals over 2 yearsold be withdrawn. Therefore, on December 10, 1979, the Service publisheda notice (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the June 16, 1976, proposal.On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised notice of reviewfor native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480); <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was included in that notice as a category 1 species.Category 1 is comprised of taxa for which the Service has sufficient biologicaldata to support proposing them as endangered or threatened. In addition,<T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was designated with an asterisk to identify that speciesas one that may recently have become extinct. In 1982, a <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> population was discovered (Mutz 1984). On November28, 1983, the Service published a supplement to its December 15, 1980,notice of review in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (48 FR 53640); <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was included in that notice as a category 2 species.Category 2 is composed of taxa for which the Service has information whichindicates that proposing to list those taxa as endangered or threatenedspecies is possibly appropriate, but for which substantial data on biologicalvulnerability and threat are not currently known or on file to supportproposed rules.In 1983, another population of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> was discovered on the Wasatch Plateau of centralUtah, and in 1984 still another population was found in the Wasatch Mountainsof Utah. Before 1983, the only known occurrence of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> in Utah was of the variety <T3>aestivalis</T3>. The <T3>R. acriformis</T3> populations of the Wasatch Mountains and WasatchPlateau have now been determined to be the variety <T3>montanensis</T3>, which previously had a known distribution in thenorthern Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> is morphologically, phenologically, and distributionallydistinct from <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>montanensis</T3>, which is located in Utah far to the north at a muchgreater elevation and flowers earlier than <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var <T3>aestivalis</T3> (Welsh and Chatterley 1985, Welsh <T3>et al.</T3> 1987). As a consequence of a Service sponsored status survey(Mutz 1984) and taxonomic evaluation of the <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> and <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>montanensis</T3> population in Utah (Welsh and Chatterley 1985), theService changed the status of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> back to category 1 in the updated plant notice of reviewpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 27, 1985.Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary of the Interior to make findings on certain petitions within12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the Act's Amendments of1982 further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, betreated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the casefor <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> because of the Service's acceptance of the 1975 Smithsonianreport as a petition. On October 13, 1983; October 12, 1984; October 11,1985; October 10, 1986, and October 9, 1987, the Service made successive1-year findings that the petition to list of <T3>R. acriformis</T3> var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> was warranted, but precluded by other listing actionsof higher priority. The present proposal constitutes the next 1 year petitionfinding for this taxon.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Ranunculus acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3> L. Benson (autumn buttercup) are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or RangeThe private landowner of the autumn buttercup's only known population hastentative plans to increase the size of the spring-fed manmade pond immediatelyto the north of the plants occupied habitat (Service 1988). That actionhas the potential to cause the extinction of the autumn buttercup throughdirect habitat destruction or modification.B. Overutilization For Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposesWith the very small existing population, any use of the autumn buttercupmay seriously reduce the prospect of the species' survival. Benson (1948)recognized this threat. There is no known utilization of the autumn buttercupfor commercial, recreational, scientific; or educational purposes. However,any collecting or vandalism could cause the extinction of the autumn buttercup.C. Disease or PredationThe autumn buttercup apparently has been extirpated from its type localityabout 1 mile south of its currently known location (Benson 1948, Palmieri1976, Mutz 1984). The total known population of the autumn buttercup hasbeen reduced to one hummocky knoll of less than 0.01 acre and about 20individuals as of August 1987. In 1983, when the species was first censused,407 adult plants and 64 seedling were counted (Mutz 1984). In 1984, thespecies was observed in its extant population and was heavily grazed. In1985, the Service censused the population; eight individuals were found,none of which had flowered that year, and the habitat had been heavilygrazed. Only one mature leaf on one of the eight plants had not been grazed(Service 1985). In 1986, the population numbered 14 individuals, of which4 flowered. There had been moderate grazing in the immediate vicinity ofthe buttercups (Service 1986). In 1987, the population numbered 12 adultplants and 6 seedlings. The flowering parts were all grazed before anyseed was set (Service 1987). This taxon is endemic to spring-fed peatymarshes within wet meadows along the upper Sevier River in Garfield County,Utah. Most of the potential habitat has been and continues to be used forlivestock pasture and other agricultural uses. Continued intense grazingof the autumn buttercup's occupied habitat is likely to cause its extinctionin the foreseeable future. There are no known insect parasites or diseaseorganisms which significantly affect this species.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismsThe autumn buttercup receives no protection or consideration under anyFederal or State law or regulation.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting It Continued Existence The low numbers and limited distribution of the autumn buttercup contributeto the buttercup's vulnerability to natural or man-caused stresses. Furtherreduction in the number of plants would reduce the reproductive capabilityand genetic diversity of the species. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Ranunculus acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis </T3>as endangered. Threatened status is not appropriatebecause <T3>Ranunculus acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis </T3>is in danger of extinction throughout its range dueto the degradation of its habitat and apparently to direct livestock grazingpressure. For reasons given below, it is not considered prudent to proposedesignation of critical habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time. The limited distributionand accessibility of the autumn buttercup make it vulnerable to vandalismand collecting. These potential threats are of particular significancesince the known population site is easily accessible and increased publicaccess would be difficult to control under existing authorities. The oneremaining site contains a very small population, and any loss could beextremely deterimental.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe State and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orreault in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy or adverselymodify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adversely affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. However, <T3>R. acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis </T3>is not known to occur on lands under Federal jurisdiction,and no Federal involvement with this species is currently known. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell of offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession this species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. With respect to <T3>Ranunculus acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis, </T3>it is anticipated that few if any, trade permits wouldever be sought or issued since the species is not common in the wild andis unknown in cultivation. Requests for copies of the regulations on plantsand inquires regarding them may be addressed to the Office of ManagementAuthority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Washington,DC 20038-7329 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or other interested parties concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Ranunculus acriformis </T3>var. <T3>aestivalis</T3>; (2) The location of any additional population of this species and the reasonwhy any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitatas provided by section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if required. Request must be filed within 45 days of the date of the proposal.Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the State Supervisor,Fish and Wildlife Enhancement, Salt Lake City, Utah (see <T2>addresses </T2>above).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessement,as defined in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not beprepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a)of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining theService's reasons for this determination was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Benson, L. 1948.
