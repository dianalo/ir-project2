HEATH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In its latest drastic attempt toend hyperinflation, the government says it will fire and retirecivil servants, radically trim bureaucracy and raise taxes andduties on farm products.   Economy Minister Antonio Ernan Gonzalez announced the newpackage in a nationally televised speech Sunday night.   He called for public ``support, tolerance and comprehension toprevent bankruptcy from dragging us into anarchy and social chaos.''   Banks and exchange houses were to remain closed today to allowimplementation of measures aimed at stabilizing the country'sfinancial system.   The government of President Carlos Menem, who took office inJuly, has been beset by recession, inflation that soared more than8,100 percent over the last 12 months, the plunging value of thenational currency, rising interest rates, labor strife and recordunemployment.   The package Gonzalez announced was approved during marathonweekend Cabinet sessions. He said the government plans to trim $2billion from expenses through the retirement and dismissal ofgovernment workers and elimination of state bureaucracy.   Effective immediately, Gonzalez said, all state workers who havereached retirement age but continue to work will be retired whilethose who are within two years of retirement will be laid off andpaid their salaries until they reach retirement. Vacancies will notbe filled.   The minister did not say how many state workers would beaffected. State employees now total 2.5 million in a total nationallabor force of 12.5 million.   In addition, the minister said, all 56 government secretariatswill be eliminated and sub-secretariats will be cut from thecurrent total of 112 to 32, with their duties being taken over bythe ministries from which they now depend.   Speaking to reporters after the speech, Gonzalez described theelimination of secretariats and sub-secretariats as the ``mostdrastic'' of the new measures and denied that the retirementsconstituted ``massive dissmissals.''   The minister also announced intervention in the management ofthe National Development Bank and the closure, effective today, ofthe National Mortgage Bank, used principally to finance building oflow-income housing.   The banks lose tens of millions of dollars a year through badloans, poor collections and the political decision to financeprovincial budgets at the expense of the national government.   Steps also will be taken to solve the problems of a few privatebanks that encounter chronic difficulties, Gonzalez said, withoutspecifying what would be entailed.   Other steps included suspension for 60 days of payments toholders of state contracts and continuation of an earlier measuresuspending state subsidies for industrial promotion.   Gonzalez said the state will raise an additional $600 million inincome through a 1.5 percent increase in the tax on capital goodsand an average 5 percent boost in duties on agricultural exports.   Guillermo Alchouron, president of the Argentine Rural Society,which represents the country's leading producers of beef forexport, said the minister's description of the crisis ``wasrealistic and impressive'' and recommended postponement of sectoralcomplaints ``no matter how just and reasonable they may be.''   The printing of money to finance the state deficit has beenprohibited, Gonzalez said.   The minister also announced that all state employees will bepaid a minumum monthly salary of $90, beginning April l.   Many state employees now earn far less than that amount. Thelargest teachers' union announced last week it would strike today,the first day of the 1990 school year, if the government did notgrant a basic wage of $66 a month.   Gonzalez made no mention of expected increases in public utilityrates. Fuel prices, however, rose by 124.5 percent on Sunday,following a Saturday night announcement by Energy Secretary JulioCesar Araoz.   Menem has raised public service rates drastically during hiseight months in office, and pledged to open up Argentina's statedominated economy by selling public companies, deregulatingmonopolies, lowering tariff barriers, raising taxes and cuttingsubsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
