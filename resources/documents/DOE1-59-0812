The elementsof the system are as follows: nuclear power and heating plants,nuclearfuels and the fuel cycle, nuclear power engineering, nuclear power civilengineering, and the coordination system, i.e., the nuclear safety commission.The elements of the system of the nuclear power complex are continuouslyundergoing development, i.e., extended reproduction and innovation ina chain of logically continuous stages one following up on another: research,planning, project, implementation/construction, commissioning. The informationflows of the different stages are characterized, and briefly summed upare demands on the nuclear information centre which should focus on informationconcerning development and feedback of all elements in the system ofthe nuclear power complex arranged in the respective data retrieval bases.(Z.M.). 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
