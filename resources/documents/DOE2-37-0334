In 1981, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive WasteDisposal Authority (the Authority) was formed by the 67th Legislatureand charged with the responsibility of site selection, design, construction,operation, maintenance, decommissioning, closing, and financing a low-levelradioactive waste disposal facility in Texas. The Authority is governedby a six-member Board of Directors and advised by a Citizens AdvisoryBoard. In February, 1983, the Authority retained Dames and Moore to performa statewide siting study to define one or more suitable sites. The studywas conducted in three phases, progressing from statewide screening tosite-specific studies. Each phase of screening included a more rigorousapplication of the Authority's siting criteria at various scales to narrowthe search to more favorable areas. In February, 1985, the siting studyculminated in the identification of five sites and recommendation ofone site for further consideration by the Authority. This paper providesa discussion of this site selection process.</TEXT></DOC>
