Nearly seven in 10 respondents in the Media General-AssociatedPress poll said they believe Japan, not the United States, is theleading economic power in the world today. Just 26 percent saidAmerica leads.   At the same time, however, fewer than two in 10 respondents saidtheir family's finances had worsened in the past 10 years. Andfewer still, just 13 percent, expected their finances todeteriorate in the decade ahead.   The youngest respondents, aged 18 to 29, were the mostoptimistic about their financial future. And they were the leastapt to believe the United States' economic position has slipped inthe past decade.   But their elders were solidly convinced of the United States'slide. Six in 10 said the country's economic leadership weakened inthe 1980s, while just 14 percent believed the U.S. economy grewstronger.   Despite that perception, there was only minority support for agreater federal role in industrial development. Fifty-one percentpreferred to have market forces direct industry's fortunes, while37 percent said they favored government help in financing selectedindustries. The rest were unsure.   Opinion was divided on some factors in the nation's economicperformance in the 1980s. Respondents split evenly on whethergovernment deregulation had been good or bad for the economy, andthey also split on whether the stock market had been a help orhindrance.   But there was general agreement on other issues: Nearly seven in10 said competition from foreign imports had hurt the economy inthe past decade, and about six in 10 said foreign investment in theUnited States had hurt.   Even more, nearly eight in 10, said the federal deficit haddamaged the economy. About half said corporate mergers had hurt,with others split on whether mergers helped or made no difference.   Of all the factors posed, only one was widely seen as a benefit:The increasing number of women in the work force was said by 77percent to have helped the economy in the 1980s. Men and womenshared that view equally.   On many issues, opinion split along political lines. Republicanswere a bit more sanguine about U.S. economic leadership; 48 percentof them said it had weakened, vs. 61 percent of Democrats andindependents.   Similarly, 31 percent of the Republicans polled picked theUnited States as the world's leading economy today, while just 23percent of the others agreed. And 40 percent of Republicans andindependents said deregulation had been good for the economy, vs.28 percent of the Democrats.   More Republicans may hold positive views of the economy becausemore were doing better. Sixty-five percent said their family'sfinancial situation had improved in the 1980s; that fell to 46percent of Democrats and 42 percent of the independents.   The poll was a telephone survey, so the 7 percent of thepopulation without phones _ generally the poorest Americans _ couldnot be included. In the telephone households contacted, 52 percentoverall said their family finances improved in the 1980s, 18percent said they had worsened and 28 percent said they were aboutthe same. Two percent didn't answer.   Looking to the future, 49 percent expected better finances inthe decade ahead, 13 percent expected to do worse and 34 percentexpected their financial situation to remain about the same. Fourpercent had no answer.   The survey was conducted Nov. 17-25 among 1,117 adults and had amargin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
