Other winners chosen by the magazine include a miniaturizedtelevision or computer screen that fits over one eye, a device thatconverts letters on a computer screen to Braille, and a system formaking sure infants are getting enough oxygen to their brains.   The 100 awards, for what the magazine called ``the mostinnovative and significant technological advances that haveresulted in new products in the past year,'' were to be presentedThursday at a ceremony at the Museum of Science and Industry inChicago.   ``We had less original creative work this year, fewer of what ispopularly referred to as a breakthrough, but more products that areactually ready for use by consumers,'' Robert Jones, editor of theDes Plaines, Ill.-based magazine, said in a telephone interviewWednesday.   The research centers of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration won six awards, followed by Du Pont Co. with fourand the Argonne, Oak Ridge and Los Alamos national laboratorieswith three each.   The award for the flour substitute was won by J. Michael Gouldof the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Ill. The productmakes it possible to bake reduced-calorie breads and increase thefiber content of frostings, pie fillings, puddings and snack foods.   Gould said several companies have taken out patent licenses toproduce the substance and speculated some may already be using itas a secret ingredient.   The award-winning predominantly plastic internal-combustionengine provides an unusually high one horsepower per pound: it is175 pounds and provides 175 horsepower, its developers say.   The engine was designed by Matthew Holtzberg of PolimotorResearch Inc. of Franklin Lakes, N.J., with plastic developed byRogers Corp. of Manchester, Conn. It is under evaluation by anunnamed U.S. automaker, Rogers said.   Allen Becker of Reflection Technology in Waltham, Mass., won fora matchbox-sized eyepiece that gives the wearer the illusion oflooking at a 12-inch-diagonal computer or TV screen. The two-ouncePrivate Eye can be hooked in front of one eye with a headset orattached to a hand-held computer, the company says.   The Braille ``mouse'' that permits blind or visually impairedpeople to read computer screens was invented by H. Douglas Garnerof NASA Langley Research Center in Langley, Va. No companies aremanufacturing it yet, Langley officials said.   Hamamatsu Photonic Systems Corp. of Bridgewater, N.J., won for asystem, already on the market, that prevents brain damage innewborns by monitoring the flow of oxygen to their brains. Themeasurement is done by transmitting harmless infrared light throughtheir heads. Hamamatsu worked with University College in London.   A gyroscopic stabilizing system for personal camcorders thattakes the jitters out of home video was invented by Mitsuaki Oshimaof Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan.   Du Pont won for Hivcheck, a five-minute test for the presence ofantibodies to the AIDS-causing HIV virus. It was originallydeveloped for use in Third World countries and can be performedwith minimal training and no special equipment.   Sandia Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., won two awards for asystem that harnesses small computers together to solve complexengineering problems that usually take expensive supercomputers.   The magazine's scientist of the year award went to JustinRattner, director of technology at Intel Scientific Computers inBeaverton, Ore. He was cited for his contributions to thedevelopment of parallel processing in computers.   The winners were chosen by editors and past editors of themagazine as well as scientists and engineers on its advisory board.</TEXT></DOC>
