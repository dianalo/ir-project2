Col. Oliver L. North and two arms dealers wereordered Thursday to appear March 24 for arraignment on criminalcharges arising from their roles in the Iran-Contra affair.   The arraignment was scheduled by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell, who will try the case brought by independent counselLawrence E. Walsh against Poindexter, North and retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his former business partner, AlbertHakim.   A lone picketer circled the U.S. Courthouse carrying signs thatread ``Free Oliver North'' and ``Hog Walsh'' to protest the returnWednesday of a massive indictment against the former NationalSecurity Council aide and his three co-defendants.   The picketer's views reflected the sentiments of twocongressional Republicans who last year investigated the sale ofU.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of proceeds to theNicaraguan Contra rebels.   ``I personally think that the indictment counts are pathetic,''Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, one of the Reagan administration'sstaunchest defenders during last year's congressional hearings,said during an appearance on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   ``I don't think that men like Poindexter ... and North deserveto end up being prosecuted on criminal grounds that deal with theirservice in government,'' Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., said on theNBC-TV ``Today'' program.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who chaired the House Iran-Contracommittee, defended the indictment, saying it reflected many of thecommittee's findings even though the panel did not say criminalacts were involved.   ``When we set out, there were a number of laws that we thoughthad been broken. ... The indictments track these findings in ourreport very carefully,'' Hamilton said.   In New Orleans, meanwhile, David Jacobsen, one of three Americanhostages released as a result of the weapons shipments to Iran,opened an address to a convention of hospital administrators bysaying he was ``angry that my friend Terry Anderson is entering hisfourth year as a hostage.''   ``I am also angry that Oliver North, who I also consider afriend, is being held hostage by a foreign policy dispute betweenthe president and Congress.''   Anderson, who is the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is one of nine American hostages being held inthe Middle East. Anderson was kidnapped on a West Beirut street onMarch 16, 1985, and is believed being held by pro-Iranian groups inLebanon.   Secord called the charges a ``creation of fantasy ...ludicrous.'' Speaking in a telephone interview, he said he would``crush'' the case with legal maneuvering ``in hopes that nobodyelse has to go through what I have.''   The massive 101-page indictment returned Wednesday by a specialgrand jury that has investigated the case for 14 months chargesNorth, Hakim and Secord engaged in a conspiracy to circumvent astatutory ban on U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels by setting up aprivate weapons supply network for the Contras.   The alleged conspiracy, which the indictment says was laterjoined by Poindexter, also corrupted the arms-for-hostage dealswith Iran by diverting more than half the $30 million generated bythe weapons sales to foreign bank accounts controlled by Hakim andSecord, the indictment said.   This money was used for other activities of the alleged``Enterprise'' _ including diversion to the Contras _ as well asthe personal gain of Hakim, Secord and North, the indictmentcharged.   Hakim and Secord were further accused of conspiring to giveNorth illegal gratuities in the form of $13,800 security system athis Great Falls, Va., home and setting up a $200,000 education fundfor North's children.   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral and North, now assignedto Marine headquarters, are charged with obstructing congressionalinquiries by falsely denying that North coordinated the privatearms network.   Both also are charged with obstructing the November 1986congressional inquiry into the arms sales to Iran as theIran-Contra affair was unraveling by making false statements to theHouse and Senate intelligence committees.   North is also charged obstructing the Nov. 21-23 presidentialinquiry by Attorney General Edwin Meese III by destroying andfalsifying classified documents and making false statements toMeese's investigators.   The indictment also alleges that Poindexter deleted a file ofall messages he sent and received in the National SecurityCouncil's computer system after a memo discussing a ``diversion''was uncovered by Meese's investigation.   A federal prosecutor said charges of destruction of evidence, ifproven, could make it easier for Walsh to get convictions.   Without this element, Walsh might have difficulty persuading ajury that the defendants were guilty of an essentially politicalcrime of thwarting the will of Congress by raising private moneyfor the Contras, said the prosecutor, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
