Each Fund is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, managementinvestment company. Federated Securities Corp., a subsidiary of FederatedInvestors, Inc. (``Federated Investors''), serves as the principal underwriterof each Fund. Federated Investors is a subsidiary of AEtna Life and CasualtyCompany and the investment adviser of each Fund is an affiliated personof Federated Investors. 2. Each Fund's investment policies currently, or may in the future, permitit to invest in U.S. government securities, which are defined in section2(a)(16) of the 1940 Act. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the ``FederalReserve'') issues and sells U.S. government securities to a select groupof ``primary dealers'', who in turn distribute the securities to otherdealers and sell them to institutional investors such as the Funds. TheFederal Reserve will only sell U.S. government securities to dealers whichsatisfy certain standards: e.g., the firm must have adequate capital relativeto the positions it assumes; the firm must be doing a reasonable volume(at least one percent of market activity) and be willing to make marketsin U.S. government securities at all times; and management in the firmmust understand the risks involved in the government market and make along term commitment to the market. There are presently 42 primary dealers,of which 14 are banks or bank affiliates. 3. Federated Investors markets certain Funds to banks which are primarydealers. If a bank becomes an affiliated person of one of the Funds, asdefined in section of 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act (``Affiliated Bank''), sections17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act would preclude the Affiliated Bankfrom engaging in any principal transactions with the Fund and may prohibitthe Affiliated Bank from accepting compensation in transations where itacts as agent for the Fund. Specifically, by virtue of section 2(a)(3)of the 1940 Act, a bank owning more than five percent of a Fund's outstandingvoting securities is an affiliated person of that Fund and, thus, is prohibitedfrom engaging in purchase and sale transactions of U.S. government securitieswith the Funds. In addition, under sections 2(a)(3) (B) and (C) of the1940 Act, a primary dealer which is a subsidiary of a bank, or which iscontrolled by the same holding company as a bank (or otherwise under controlwith the bank) is an affiliated person of the bank. Consequently, if thatbank owns or controls more than five percent of a Fund's outstanding shares,or serves as the Fund's investment adviser, then the primary dealer isan affiliated person of an affiliated person of that Fund and it cannotdeal in U.S. government securities with the Funds. 4. Over the years, the number of banks utilizing the Funds has increased,so that currently, virtually all of the banks which are either primarydealers or affiliated with primary dealers are now investors in one ormore of the Funds. The consequences to the Funds of a primary dealer becomingan Affiliated Bank are harsh: no Fund may then engage in any transactionswith that primary dealer. Presently, two of the primary dealers in longand short term U.S. government securities are Affiliated Banks and theFunds have ceased dealing with them. Other bank primary dealers or bankswhich have primary dealer affiliates could become affiliated persons ofthe Funds should they increase the amount of their investments in the Funds.5. According to the application, primary dealers, as a whole, provide themost favorable price and execution in U.S. government securities transactionsfor large institutional investors such as the Funds. The Funds can onlyobtain the most favorable price and execution in their U.S. governmentsecurities transactions, however, when they are able to deal with the entirepool of primary dealers. 6. Although most Affiliated Banks engage in U.S. government securitiestransactions for their own accounts, the Funds may engage in agency transacionswith such Affiliated Banks. Since the Affiliated Banks are neither brokersnor underwriters for purposes of the 1940 Act, section 17(e)(1) of the1940 Act prohibits them from accepting compensation in securities transactionswhere they act as agents for the Funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Conclusion </ITAG>1. The requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest andconsistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intendedby the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. In addition, the terms ofthe proposed transactions are: (1) Reasonable and fair and do not involveoverreaching on the part of any person, (2) consistent with the policyof each registered investment company concerned, and (3) consistent withthe general purposes of the 1940 Act. In purchasing and selling U.S. governmentsecurities, it is critical that the Funds obtain prompt execution of theirtransaction at a competitive price. Each primary dealer represents a significantportion of the U.S. government securities market. There are occasions,especially in the disposition of portfolio securitites in weak markets,when each primary dealer offers the most favorable price and executionas against the other dealers. Inability to trade with one or more AffiliatedBanks will deprive the Funds of the most favorable price and executionon the occasions when those dealers have the best overall offer for a transaction.Further, because the U.S. government securities market is highly competitive,removing one or more primary dealers from the Funds' market may deprivethe Funds of the most favorable price and execution even when dealing withother dealers. Consequently, the shareholders' return from their investmentin the Funds may be reduced if the Funds' access to the primary dealersis restricted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Proposed Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, the Applicants agree to the followingconditions:1. The Board of Trustees, Directors, or General Partners of each of theFunds: (1) Will adopt procedures, pursuant to which transactions may beeffected for the Funds, that are reasonably designed to provide that allthe conditions in paragraphs 2 through 6 below have been complied with,(2) will review no less frequently than annually such procedures for theircontinuing appropriateness, and (3) will determine no less frequently thanquarterly that such transactions made during the preceding quarter wereeffected in compliance with such procedures. These procedures will alsobe approved by a majority of the disinterested Trustees, Directors or GeneralPartners of the Funds. The investment adviser of each Fund will implementthose procedures and make decisions necessary to meet these conditions,subject to the direction and control of the Board of Trustees, Directorsor General Partners of each Fund.2. No Fund will engage in U.S. government securities transactions witha primary dealer that is a bank serving as investment adviser to such Fundor affiliated with such a bank.3. The Funds (1) will maintain and preserve permanently in an easily accessibleplace a written copy of the procedures (and any modifications thereto)described in paragraph 1, and (2) will maintain and preserve for a periodof not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which anytransactions occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place,a written record of each such transaction setting forth a description ofthe security purchased or sold, the identity of the person on the otherside of the transaction, the terms of the purchase or sale transaction,and the information or materials upon which the determinations describedbelow were made.4. The security to be purchased or sold by a Fund will be consistent withthe investment objectives and policies of that Fund as recited in the Fund'sregistration statement, and will be consistent with the interests of thatFund and its shareholders. Further, the security to be purchased or soldby that Fund must be comparable in terms of quality, yield, and maturityto other similar securities that are appropriate for the Fund and thatare being purchased or sold during a comparable period of time.5. The terms of the transaction must be reasonable and fair to the shareholdersof that Fund and cannot involve overreaching of that Fund or its shareholderson the part of any person concerned. Before any transaction may be conductedpursuant to the exemption, the Funds or their advisers must obtain suchinformation as they deem necessary to determine that the price to be paidor received for the security is at least as favorable as that availablefrom other sources. The Funds or their advisers must obtain and documentcompetitive quotations from at least two other dealers with respect tothe specific proposed transaction, except that if quotations are unavailablefrom two such dealers, only one other competitive quotation is required.With respect to prospective purchases of securities, these dealers mustbe those who have securities of the categories and the type desired intheir inventories and who are in a position to quote favorable prices withrespect thereto. With respect to the prospective disposition of securities,these dealers must be those who, in the experience of the Funds and theiradvisers, are in a position to quote favorable prices.6. The commission, fee, spread, or other remuneration to be received bythe Affiliated Dealer must be reasonable and fair compared to the commission,fee, spread, or other remuneration received by other brokers or dealersin connection with comparable transactions involving similar securitiesbeing purchased or sold during a comparable period of time but in no eventwill such fee, commission, spread or other remuneration exceed that whichis stated in section 17(e)(2) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirley E.
