It said in its report Wednesday that most of the other officersinvolved had surrendered and the capital was calm.   Shooting began out in the capital several hours after PresidentMengistu Haile Mariam, in power for nearly 15 years, left thecapital Tuesday with his wife for a visit to East Germany.   Troops and tanks surrounded the presidential palace, the DefenseMinistry and other government buildings. The airport was closed andcommunications cut.   Some military officers have opposed Mengistu's continued effortto fight a stalemated 28-year-old war against rebels in the north.   Goverment radio reported the capital quiet on Wednesday:   ``Some conspiring generals wanted to create great unrest anddisturbance, to shed the blood of innocent people and generallydestabilize the unity of our motherland, even though theirtreacherous aims did not succeed.''   Addis Ababa radio said: ``They tried to use force but werekilled. They are 1. Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, who was chief ofstaff. 2. Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, commander of the Air Force.''   ``Most of the conspiring generals have been forced tosurrender,'' it said.   The radio, monitored in Nairobi, Kenya, gave no other immediatedetails.   Two air force jet fighters and then a half dozen militaryhelicopters had circled the capital on Tuesday, but there were noindications they opened fire.   Air traffic controllers at the airport could be heard by radiomonitors diverting flights to the small country of Djibouti about200 miles to the northeast.   One controller told a pilot: ``No explanations. Noexplanations.''   Four hours after the shooting started, Addis Ababa radiobroadcast a statement from the ruling State Council that said thecoup attempt had been quashed. The statement was broadcast fourtimes before the radio went off the air for the night.   The shooting began at about 4 p.m. Tuesday with gunfire at theDefense Ministry. A civilian inside, contacted by telephone by TheAssociated Press, said there was ``an apparent division'' among topofficers in the ruling military.   The employee, who insisted on anonymity, said leaders of the twosides were negotiating.   ``I don't know what we've got, quite frankly,'' said a spokesmanat the U.S. Embassy.   Allen Collins, a diplomat at the British Embassy, said: ``Icannot comment on what's going on. We are trying to make our ownassessment and any comment would be premature.''   There have been persistent reports of military unrest, with thegovernment engaged in wars against separate rebel groups seekingautonomy in the northernmost provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.   Government forces have been pushed out of most of Eritrea andTigre provinces recently in humiliating defeats by guerrillas ofthe Eritrean People's Liberation Army and the Tigre People'sLiberation Army.   The Eritrean secessionists began their struggle against thegovernment 28 years ago, and in the past year the two groups joinedforces in the battle against the government.   One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``Ihaven't heard of any deep divisions within the high command.   ``What one does get a feeling for is a disenchantment within theofficer ranks generally with what appears to be an unwinnable warin the north.''   The State Council announcement said, ``At this time when thepeople of Ethiopia have been liberated from the feudal system ...and particularly when they have established a system whereby theycan administer themselves through the recent constitution, thecentral government and in the various administrative areas of ourcountry, a few generals and officers attempted to topple thegovernment and install a military regime today, but their attemptfailed.''   It did not name the forces that it said were waiting to dividethe country.   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.12, 1974, and a provisional military government was established.After fighting among factions in the armed forces, Mengistu, thenan army major, came to power that November and set up a militarygovernment with close ties to the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
