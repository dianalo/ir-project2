Among the advantagesof PFBC plants are low emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidesand a high thermal efficiency which results in substantial fuel savings.To effectively clean up the atmosphere and avoid acid rain, measuresneed to be taken to lower emissions from coal-fired as well as from oil-firedcombustion units. New fossil-fuel-fired plants must be energy efficientand with low pollution characteristics. PFBC plants fulfil those requirements.2 refs., 2 tabs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
