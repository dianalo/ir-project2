 I never thought much about this categorization until I tried towrite some history.andP;  Paul Freiberger and I were editors at InfoWorld in 1981when our boss, Thom Hogan, suggested that we interview the heroes of thepersonal computerrevolution while all the frantic events were fresh in theirmemories, and write a book that would convey the facts and the feelings ofthe revolution.andM;By the time we had finished Fire in the Valley I knew which of the meaningsof the word human motivated the classification of history among thehumanities.andP;  The humanities are the human studies, and history is a humanstudy in the sense of to err is human.andP;  We did a lot of choosing amongalternative versions of events in researching Fire in the Valley, oftendeciding what must have been true on the basis of plausibility.andP;  The judgmentof plausibility is, of course, highly subjective.andM;We were not alone in making such subjective choices.andP;  We wrote a history of arevolution, but history itself appears to be of many minds about the nature,duration, and very existence of that revolution or, as it may be, thoserevolutions.andP;  I have since read history books and articles that contend thatthe revolution hasn't happened yet, that it was over in 1974, that therehasn't been any revolution, and that there have been several.andP;  It appearsthat we can take our choice of histories.andP;  I choose to say that there was arevolution, and that it's over, and that we won.andM;Now that the recent glorious war of liberation is over, it is time tocelebrate our heroes, decorate the battle sites, and begin the job ofcivilizing the wilderness and creating the new society for which we fought.andO;Revolutionary Decade: 1974  1983 just as the history of the Americanrevolution does not begin with the Magna Carta, I won't hark back to LarryTesler and Jeff Rulifson's readings in semiotics at Xerox PARC, or DougEngelhart's blueprints for user-friendly design at SRI, or that bizarrecommunity of neologistic technophiles at MIT.andM;One event preceding the main event must be mentioned, though: The 1974self-publication by Ted Nelson of Computer Lib/Dream Machines.andP;  Computer Libwas the Common Sense of the revolution, and Nelson its Tom Paine.andP;  It's abook still worth dipping into, which is, in fact, the only way in which it ispossible to read the book,andM;But the revolution actually broke out over Christmas break, 1974-75, with thepublication of an article on a kit computer from a firm in Albuquerque.andO;Specifically, it was the hobbyist phase of the personal computer revolutionthat began when that january 1975 issue of Popular Electronics hit thestands, with its cover story on the MITS Altair computer.andP;  There were otherfronts on which the revolution could have broken out: Any electronichobbyists who could lay hands on a microprocessor could attempt to build acomputer, and some did.andP;  Stephen Wozniak, whose first attempt in 1971 went upin smoke, was only the best known of them, but in the Southwest, theNorthwest, in New jersey and New York and Massachusetts and California,hobbyists were creating the personal computer, Don Lancaster demonstrated howto build your own terminal in 1973, and Radio Electronics published a pieceon the Mark 8, your Personal minicomputer, in 1974,andM;But even though the Altair featured on the Popular Electronics cover was oneof many, and was in fact only a mock-up, it was the shot heard' round thehobbyist community, because it promised a computer on your desktop for under$500.andP;  The average hobbyist couldn't buy the parts for that price.andP;  TheAltair started the revolution.andM;In 1975, computer clubs sprang up around the country; groups in southernCalifornia, Silicon Valley, and New jersey would be especially influential,but the Boston Computer Society, founded two years later by jonathanRotenberg, would prove more enduring.andP;  Dozens of small companies sprang upovernight, growing to hundreds within two years.andP;  Computer retailing began in1975 at Dick Heiser's Computer Store in Los Angeles, and by 1977 the firstcomputer store franchise chain had been launched: it was called Computerland.andO;Computer magazines evolved out of user group newsletters, with Wayne Green'sByte rapidly achieving preeminence among the hundreds that existed at theirpeak.andP;  Personal computer shows became popular.andP;  Software companies werelaunched, starting with Microsoft, which wrote the Basic for the Altair, andDigital Research, which created the CP/M operating system.andP;  Languages andoperating systems were the first kinds of software needed for the machines,and Dr. Dobb's Journal was launched in 1976 to put a Basic interpreter in thehands of hobbyists.andM;The hobbyist phase in i came to an end in 1977, the year Apple opened officesin Cupertino and put an assembled and slick-looking Apple 11 on the market.andO;This was also the year that the big electronics companies (Tandy/Radio Shackand Commodore) announced their first PC, and the year MITS effectively wentunder.andM;By 1978 it was possible, with a lot of imagination, to consider using apersonal computer for business purposes.andP;  Disk drives were replacing cassetterecorders for storage.andP;  There were word processors and databases andaccounting programs.andP;  By the end of 1979, there was a very good wordprocessor called WordStar, and an innovative electronic spreadsheet programcalled VisiCalc.andP;  You could choose among IMSAI and Cromemco and ProcessorTechnology machines, or bypass the hobbyist standard S-100 bus and buy anApple II, Radio Shack Model I, Commodore PET, Exidy Sorceror, or a computerfrom video game manufacturer Atari.andP;  By 1980, Radio Shack, Texas Instruments,and Sinclair had all introduced very low-cost computers and made itreasonable for non-fanatics to satisfy their curiosity about personalcomputers.andP;  Most buyers were hobbyists and most software fell into thecategory of utilities or games through 1978 and 1979, but most of thecompanies understood that the personal computer would be an extremelyimportant business tool, and were fighting to establish a serious reputationand a position in the market before some mainframe computer company got intothe game and changed the rules.andM;Apple had emerged as the leading personal computer company by 1980.andP;  Themachine was well designed, the company was skillfully managed, and Apple tookupon itself the task of marketing the concept of a personal computer to askeptical general public.andP;  It didn't hurt that VisiCalc, the first programthat could sell a computer, ran only on an Apple II.andP;  Apple management wasacutely aware of the need to get big enough to survive when the big companystepped in, and it was becoming clear that the biggest company would soontake the plunge.andM;Microsoft began developing an operating system for IBM in 1980.andO;HewlettPackard had entered the fray in 1980, Xerox came in 1981, and DECannounced a line of personal computers in 1982.andP;  But it was the IBM PC,announced in mid-1981, that launched the next phase of the personal computerrevolution.andM;From 1981 to 1984, most personal computer companies were concerned with IBMPC compatibility.andP;  Some companies didn't get it right, and failed.andP;  Some,such as TI, decided they could do without the competition of IBM, and got outof personal computers.andP;  But many hardware companies and many more softwarecompanies prospered in the new air of legitimacy that IBM brought to themarket.andP;  Lotus, Ashton-Tate, and Microsoft became big companies.andP;  It was theBig Blue phase, but not because IBM dominated the market in sales.andP;  IBMsimply defined what a PC was during this period.andM;That's why it is so significant that the IBM PC was an open machine.andP;  IBMcould have released a proprietary machine at a premium price, differentiatedit clearly from the computers that had sprung up out of the hobbyistcommunity, and sold lots of computers into its loyal business user base.andO;instead, it produced a machine with an open architecture running athird-party operating system and third-party application software, allderived from that hobbyist community.andP;  It permitted competitors to developIBM- compatible machines to the point where the clone makers had a greatercollective market share than IBM.andP;  This was not what anyone had expected fromIBM, and some credit may be due to Bill Gates for nudging IBM in thedirection of an open architecture.andP;  But it was IBM that decided to talk toMicrosoft in 1980.andM;Meanwhile, Apple was presenting itself as the guardian of the computer powerto the people spirit of the hobbyist phase while building a new machine thatwould feature an architecture so closed that it was even hard to find a toolwith which to open the case.andP;  The irony was not lost on the savvy personalcomputer community.andP;  After the Fire That's how things stood at the outset of1984.andP;  That January, it looked as though the big news of the year in thecomputer industry was going to be a commercial: The legendary Ridley ScottSuperBowl ad for the Macintosh.andP;  The Mac itself was big new$, and the Canonlaser engine was an important technical advance that year.andP;  A few otherthings happened, too.andM;MS-DOS 2.0 was released and Bill Gates made the cover of Time.andP;  ATandamp;Tintroduced its first personal computer.andP;  The press was chanting shakeout, andBusiness Week crowned IBM the winner and sole survivor with 26 percent marketshare.andP;  Jack Tramiel resigned as president of Commodore, then bought Atari,vowing to turn this company from a democracy into a dictatorship.andP;  In 1984,the line workers in Silicon Valley computer companies made from $3.50 to$11.50 an hour, as compared with the $1.20 hourly average earned by Taiwaneseworkers.andP;  The companies behind VisiCalc, Software Arts, and VisiCorp, gotinto a legal wrangle that had aspects of a mutual suicide pact.andM;This was the year when all the windowing systems for PCs were vying forattention.andP;  IBM introduced TopView, which briefly looked like a competitor toMicrosoft Windows, QuarterDeck Desq, and a rumored DRI product.andP;  JimFawcette, editorial director of InfoWorld at the time, characterized TopViewas a program for expert users of novice programs.andP;  TopView was pretty bad,but it was from IBM, and a lot of IBM watchers thought that it must be partof an IBM plan to proprietarize the IBM operating system.andP;  DRI introducedGEM, which was praised in the press for bringing a Mac-like interface to thePC.andP;  The irony of that praise would soon be apparent.andM;Americans polled by the Louis Harris organization in 1984 said that theyviewed computers as capable of making life easier and better, but they alsofeared that computers might take their jobs and undermine their privacy.andP;  Atthe same time, some users of on-line conferencing systems claimed that theirprivacy was being violated when magazines reprinted their electroniccomments.andP;  The Harris poll supported the idea that a schism of computer havesand have-nots was growing.andP;  The Supreme Court upheld the right to recordvideo programs on our Betamaxes, as an Info World story put it.andP;  The decisionheld up even though &quot;Betamax&quot; has the ring of &quot;Tucker&quot; today.andM;Spurred on by the movie War Games and the arrest of the 414s in 1983, the FBIput into place a three-week training program for agents: They went inignorant and came out fully qualified to investigate computer crimes.andP;  Thatyear the FBI raided the homes of four Huntsville, Alabama teenagers suspectedof cracking NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network, which had little in theway of security and no classified or sensitive information.andM;It wasn't the FBI, but a Los Angeles detective and two Pacific Telephonesecurity officers who ripped out Tom Tcimpidis's BBS hardware.andP;  Someone hadposted a credit-card code and two Sprint access numbers on Tcimpidis'sbulletin board, and when the Pac Tel police arrived at the door, they madeTcimpidis the computer community cause celebre of the year.andP;  The judge in thecase said that he understood the issues involved, having seen War Games.andP;  PacTel eventually dropped the case, but made it clear that it might prosecuteother bulletin board operators.andM;By the fall, the House of Representatives was examining a computer crime billthat would make unauthorized access to a computer system a felony if itresulted in a $5000 loss to a victim or an equal gain to the cracker.andM;Nibble magazine either clarified or clouded the waters when it won aninjunction against a program-typing service that wasn't doing enough typing.andO;Nibble was publishing code in its pages for its readers to key in and use.andO;The typing service, Amtype, ostensibly charged $10 for typing the code forpeople, sending them a disk with the code on it.andP;  In fact, they were typingthe code once and running off copies.andP;  Had they actually typed the code eachtime, Nibble argued, that would have been legal, but what they were doing wasa violation of copyright.andM;Massachusetts Congressman Edward Markey launched an online discussion ofnuclear weapons.andP;  Many candidates were using personal computers in theircampaigns, a few even going online to get input from computer-usingconstituents.andM;1985 was a bloody year Software Arts died of self-inflicted wounds, LotusDevelopment Corp. acquiring its product line, founders, and reputation forhaving invented the electronic spreadsheet.andP;  DRI, facing hard times, cut backon staff.andP;  Counting on GEM to pull it out of its slump, it lost some momentumwhen Apple forced it to redesign the product to look less Mac-like.andP;  Controlof Apple computer was wrested from Steve jobs, who left, selling off stock,and taking key people with him to start a new company.andP;  Most industry leadersviewed this as a positive step for Apple, although Philippe Kahn said theonly people left are the bean counters.andM;The U.S.andP;  Patent and Trademark Office, which formerly had a policy of notgranting patents for software, began taking applications for software patentsseriously, as directed by the Supreme Court in decisions earlier in thedecade.andP;  Several applications were under scrutiny, and Number 4,555,775 wasgranted to ATandamp;T for a hardware/ software display system it called windows.andO;ATandamp;T's windows appeared to be a fairly specific invention, not related towindowing systems.andM;DDJ did some beard-pulling in 1985, finding weaknesses in Turbo Pascal,showing how to add both memory and a hard disk to the closed Macintosh, andpublishing Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto.andM;And so it went.andP;  In 1986 Intel laid off 700 employees, IBM unveiled itsRISC-based RT PC, and credit card-sized computers came on the scene.andP;  By1986, over 90 percent of the school systems in America had (some) personalcomputers.andP;  A study showed that personal computer use resulted in an 80percent reduction in television viewing.andP;  DDJ went online in 1986.andM;1987 saw the Computer Security Act passed, mandating that government agenciesprotect the privacy and security of sensitive data.andP;  IBM lost five percentmarket share, about the same number of unit sales Compaq picked up.andP;  In 1987,language and operating system implementations were getting moresophisticated.andP;  Basic showed some new versions, C some standards efforts, andoptimizing compilers and object-oriented programming were getting attention,as was Microsoft's operating system for the future, OS/2.andP;  The Current PhaseIn 1988 Apple announced a strategic alliance with DEC and sued Microsoft andHewlett-Packard over look-and-feel.andP;  Microsoft and HP countersued; OS/2 1.1met its ship date; Steve jobs's company, NEXT, showed off its machine.andM;IBM was getting pressure from customers to license its Micro Channelarchitecture.andP;  Clone makers, though, criticized MCA, professed littleinterest in developing MCA machines, and, led by Compaq, formed a Gang ofNine to develop an alternative in the form of an extended AT architecturecalled EISA.andP;  IBM released two new computers labelled PS/2s but based on theexisting AT bus architecture, while several Gang of Nine members admittedthat they were hedging their bets and still working on MCA machines.andP;  Mostobservers felt that there was only room for one standard and that the battlewould be won and lost on the 386 battleground.andM;Paul Heckel was awarded a patent for ZoomRacks, his card-in-rack hypertextsystem, while Xerox got a patent on the icons in its Viewpoint interface, thefirst patent granted on user interface elements.andM;The Open Software Foundation was formed to develop a non-ATandamp;T standard forUnix.andP;  ATandamp;T and Sun were at work on Open Look, a graphical front end forUnix; Sun licensed Viewpoint icons for Open Look; and IBM began talking withNEXT about developing a competing graphical front end for IBM's Unix, AIX.andM;In 1989 QuarterDeck won a patent for the multitasking windowing system inDesqview.andP;  The first EISA machines arrived, and were high-end machines thatdidn't exactly throw down a gauntlet to IBM.andM;In 1990 Windows 3.0 was delivered, pa rumpa pum pum.andP;  HP's New Wave desktopenvironment skipped version 2 and went straight to the magic number 3.0,adding agents (task-spanning macros).andP;  Borland announced that the nextversions of Turbo Pascal and Turbo C would have object-oriented features,which would result in a huge increase in the number of programmers exposed toOOP.andM;A number of notebook computers with hand-printing recognition and stylusinput were announced or hinted at.andP;  Xerox came out with a combinationplain-paper fax, copier, printer, and scanner.andP;  Apple demonstrated that itwasn't kidding about getting competitive in its pricing by introducing newlow-priced computers and lowering prices on some existing machines.andP;  PCmanufacturers continued to keep the EISA, MCA, and old AT bus architecturesalive, while the media conglomerate named MCA told IBM to stop using thatacronym, and IBM agreed.andM;Lotus and Novell talked merger, but changed their minds.andP;  Raima entered intojoint ventures with several Soviet software companies.andP;  Security of sensitivedata in the computers of many government agencies was not in compliance withthe Computer Security Act of 1987 after three years.andP;  IBM picked up marketshare and spun off its Information Products division  typewriters, printers,keyboards), leading to speculation that other divisions would follow.andM;And in 1990 Mitch Kapor issued his Software Design Manifesto, his first stepin a plan to create an environment in which good software design pays offcommercially.andP;  He also founded, with Steve Wozniak and John Perry Barlow, theElectronic Frontier Foundation to educate the public about social issues ofthe information age.andM;If the revolution is over and we won, then what Mitch Kapor is up to now ismore important than any work underway in any research and development lab inthe world.andP;  The conscious design of software for use by people on the onehand, and the development of a consensus on values for electroniccommunication on the other, will define the kind of world we will inhabit inthe future.andM;As software designers, you have the greatest opportunity and the greatestresponsibility for the shaping of that world, because you are the architectsof the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
