(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration should be congratulated for doing its job in finingJohn Morrell andamp; Co. a record $4.33 million for violations at itsmeatpacking plant here, a union leader said Friday.   OSHA conducted a six-month investigation after workers complainedand found the company did little or nothing in light of hundreds ofserious injuries to hand and arm joints caused by the repetitivemotion of the meatpacking line.   ``We actually congratulate OSHA for doing their job. During thispresent administration, we found that getting OSHA to do their jobsometimes was very difficult,'' said Jim Lyons, president of Local304A of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The localrepresents workers at the Sioux Falls plant.   The OSHA citation ``basically says that Morrell knew that therewas a problem. We brought that problem to them. We addressed it withthem many times. They knew ways of preventing it, and not only that,we found their medical mismanagement to be incredible, a largeincredible problem, and obviously OSHA found our account to beaccurate,'' Lyons said.   The OSHA report ``exposed the ugly truth about the health andsafety conditions'' inside the Sioux Falls plant, he said.   Morrell is being singled out for penalties in what is a nationalsafety and health problem affecting many industries, the companysaid. Chairman Milton J. Schloss, in a statement from companyheadquarters in Cincinnati, called the fine ``grossly unfair andtotally unjustified.''   The fine is the seventh time in almost two years that themeatpacker has been cited for safety problems.   In April 1987, OSHA fined Morrell $690,000 for allegedrecord-keeping violations dealing with injuries. An administrativelaw judge in Denver dismissed the fine this week, saying the statuteof limitations expired.   In September, the agency slapped the company with a $28,900 finefor safety violations stemming from a plant inspection last spring.Morrell is contesting the citation.   Workers have complained that Morrell has increased the speed ofits production lines at the meatpacking plant and that injury rateshave soared accordingly. Injuries and past OSHA fines have led tosegments on the TV news magazine programs ``20-20'' and ``West57th'' and articles in major newspapers.   OSHA officials said the incidence of repetitive motion-relateddisorders at the Sioux Falls plant was nine times higher than theindustry average and 600 times the rate for all U.S. industries.   Morrell, however, said the injuries that had to be reported fellfrom 70.5 per 1,000 full-time workers in January, when it hired afull-time safety director for its plants here and in Sioux City,Iowa, to 16.75 in October.   Morrell and the union have been at loggerheads dozens of times,including strikes, contract deadlocks, lawsuits and appearancesbefore regulatory boards.   The company and the union are in the middle of talks for a newcontract at the Sioux Falls plant. Morrell has asked for wage cutsranging from $1.25 an hour to $1.75 an hour, to a base rate of $8 anhour. Union officials have said if the company continues to push forwage cuts, a strike is possible. The contract expires Nov. 20.</TEXT></DOC>
