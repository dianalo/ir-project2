The St. Louis-based contractor, which produces the Army's M-1 tank, the Air Force's F-16 fighter jet, and the Navy's Trident submarine, came in second place the previous fiscal year, when it was awarded $7.4 billion in Defense Department contracts.    McDonnell Douglas Corp., which came in first in fiscal 1985, with $8.9 billion in contracts, slipped to third place in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30, with $6.5 billion of contracts.    General Dynamics fell behind McDonnell in 1985 partly because the Defense Department suspended it from new contracts for several months because of overcharging and other contract violations. Once the company was released from the suspension, the Pentagon pushed through a backlog of contracts, accounting for some of the jump in defense business in fiscal 1986.    General Electric Co., which netted $6.8 billion of contracts, was in second place in fiscal 1986. GE, one of the Air Force's major engine-builders, rose from fourth place in the previous fiscal year, when it won $5.9 billion of work.    General Motors Corp. also jumped in the ranking, coming in fifth in fiscal 1986 with $5 billion of contracts, up from 17th the previous year, with $1.6 billion of work. The change chiefly reflects the completion of General Motors' acquisition of Hughes Aircraft Co. in December 1985.    The top 10 contractors for fiscal 1986 were: General Dynamics; General Electric; McDonnell Douglas; Rockwell International Corp., $5.5 billion in contracts; GM; Lockheed Corp., $4.8 billion in contracts; Raytheon Corp., $4 billion in contracts; Boeing Co., $3.5 billion in work; United Technologies Corp., $3.5 billion in contracts; and Grumman Corp. with $2.9 billion in contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
