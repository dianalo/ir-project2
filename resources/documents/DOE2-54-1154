Within the Bay of Fundy, about 3,700 fishermenland about $17 million worth of sea products, primarily lobster and herring.About 120 processing, handling or packing companies are also involved,employing over 3,600 people; total value of fisheries products in 1972was estimated at $52.7 million. In the Gulf of Maine, about 12,000 fishermenand 5500 processing plant workers are involved in the industry, whosetotal value of product in 1971 was estimated at $72.8 million. The principalspecies stocks and their seasonal movements are outlined, including cod,haddock, flounder, herring, mackerel, scallops, lobsters, shrimp, andclams. The effects of tidal power development will be felt mainly behindand near the tidal barriers. The principal effects behind the barrierswill relate to the new mean tidal level, its amplitude, and whether thephase is shifted significantly. Changes could occur in the extent ofintertidal clam flats, migration of fish, and species composition anddistribution. On the positive side, an enclosed tidal power basin mightlend itself to controlled culture of certain species such as oysters.At the barriers, passage of marine fish would be impeded. Outside thebarriers, tidal amplitudes may be generally increased, and increasedtidal currents could increase turbidity in the Bay of Fundy with consequenteffects on certain species such as scallops. A significant change inhydrographic regimes could affect species low in the food chain, therebyaffecting higher species such as herring. 15 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
