The model was developed for Northeast Utilities'Millstone Point nuclear generating station, which is located on Connecticut'sAtlantic coast and experiences sea breeze conditions frequently. Themodel provides a three-dimensional simulation of the complex sea breezecirculation, including the return flow aloft, and yields concentrationpatterns consistent with the simulated wind flows.</TEXT></DOC>
