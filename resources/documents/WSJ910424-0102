On Tuesday, Mr. Poehl caught the government off-guard bywarning against rushing into a European monetary union andcommitting the same &quot;disastrous&quot; mistakes made in Germany'sown currency union. The central bank chief believes thatmonetary union should have waited until East Germany'seconomy was brought into closer alignment with WestGermany's.</LP><TEXT>   But yesterday, speaking to business leaders in Bonn,Chancellor Kohl said that &quot;it is more than obvious that thevery special issues of the German-German monetary union havenothing to do with discussions on the concepts for Europeanmonetary union.&quot;   Mr. Kohl said thousands of East Germans fleeing their partof the country gave Bonn no options other than to quicklybring the Deutsche mark to what was East Germany, atfavorable conversion rates.   Mr. Poehl's comments could sharpen public and governmentaldebate over the speed and scope of European monetary union.Bonn sources say Finance Minister Theo Waigel and senioraides in the chancellor's office share some of Mr. Poehl'sreservations. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,however, favors quick moves toward a single Europeancurrency.</TEXT></DOC>
