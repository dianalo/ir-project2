(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A FEW YEARS ago, the notion of &quot;competitor intelligence&quot; evoked images ofindustrial espionage: chartered planes buzzing plant sites, privatedetectives and listening devices at trade shows.andP;  But times have changed.andO;Competitor intelligence (CI) is shedding its cloak-and-dagger image andbecoming a key strategic-planning tool for companies large and small.andP;  Twotrends have helped to lure CI from the shadows: the quickening pace oftechnological change and intensified rivalries for market share, especiallyfrom overseas.andP;  Both factors, observes Kirk Tyson, president of theCompetitor Intelligence Group, have forced companies to pay closer attentionto the competition.andP;  &quot;Markets-even entire industries-now change overnight,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;To be successful, you've got to stay on top of that.&quot;andM;Monitoring a rival's moves is older than the bazaars of Baghdad.andP;  But inrecent years, the cost of collecting that information has dropped as the needfor it has grown.andP;  With the proliferation and growing ease of use of publicdatabases, volumes of intelligence are now within reach of a PC.andP;  With amodem and subscriptions to a handful of services, it's easy to learn aboutyour competitor's sales, size, profit and loss, credit history, organization,officers, R and D activities, intellectual property and more.andM;Even if your corporation maintains an elaborate CI department, doing theresults yourself gives you the information you need when you need it.andO;Moreover, you control the direction of the research and don't have to rely onsomeone else's judgment.andM;Most CI professionals contend that gathering intelligence by PC alone is nota complete solution; you'll still want to confirm rumors from your salesforce, interview your competitor's suppliers and use many traditional CItechniques.andP;  But few dispute that the PC helps you gather the greatestintelligence in the most efficient way.andM;When embarking on a CI program, suggests Tyson, your paramount concern shouldbe to distinguish strategic intelligence from &quot;nice-to-know&quot; facts about arival.andP;  You can run up tremendous online costs and generate little usefulinformation by sailing into the oceans of available online data withoutcharting a clear course.andM;Begin by narrowing your list of competitors to the top three to five, hesays.andP;  Then determine the pivotal points on which you compete: pricing,service, distribution and innovation, for instance.andP;  Restrict your search tothese points.andP;  Car rental companies, for example, compete chiefly on pricing,service and location.andP;  In that case, searching for a competitor's labor costswould yield little of strategic use, but the knowledge that your rival justpurchased counter space at four regional airports can be invaluable to you.andM;Once you've focused your search criteria, begin gathering intelligence with athree-tiered approach: daily intelligence briefings; profiles of yourcompetitor's essential finances, market and product lines; and sharplyfocused data such as company officers, sales strategies and managementstructure.andM;I.andP;  DAILY BRIEFINGSandM;CLIPPING SERVICES, electronic and otherwise, are the bedrock of a CI program.andO;They provide context, generate new leads and help you piece disparate datainto a coherent whole.andP;  Electronic clippings have the dual advantages oftimeliness and an ASCII format, so you can export the data into spreadsheets,database managers and PIMs--the key tools for analyzing intelligence.andM;Use enough clipping services to ensure adequate coverage of your subject.andO;Begin with CompuServe's Executive News Service (GO ENS) or GEnie's NewsGridExecutive News, which provide the simplest and least expensive way (you payonly for connect time) to get a daily briefing on changes in your market orindustry during business hours.andP;  (In fact, you'll find that CompuServe isoften the least expensive way to gain access to many CI databases.) GEnie(G.E.andP;  Information Services, 401 N. Washington St., Rockville, Md.andP;  20850;800-638-9636) costs $18 an hour; CompuServe  5000 Arlington Center Blvd.,andO;Columbus, Ohio 43220; 800-848-8199) costs $12.50 an hour plus $10 per month.andM;CompuServe's ENS lets you create as many clipping folders as you like, eachwith seven key phrases using Boolean separators and a wildcard command.andP;  Itscans the AP, UPI, Reuters Financial Report (on public companies), WashingtonPost Online, OTC NewsAlert (over-the-counter securities) and McGraw-Hill News(company and industry news) wire services 24 hours a day.andM;Unlike GEnie's NewsGrid, ENS includes a time-saving scan function that letsyou read the top of each story before retrieving its full text.andP;  Downloading10 average-length articles will set you back about $3.andM;GEnie's NewsGrid (type: M 340) covers international business marginallybetter than CompuServe does.andP;  It scans general foreign news wires such asAgence France Presse (France), Deutsch Press-Agentur (Germany), Agencia EFE Spain), Kyodo News Service (Japan) and Xinhua News Agency (China), along withselective stories from BusinessWire (industry and company news), PR Newswire(press releases), Dow Jones, UPI and others.andP;  You're allowed to enter as manyas 10 keywords or phrases (with Boolean separators, but no wildcardsearches).andM;Dow Jones News/Retrieval (Dow Jones andamp; Co., P.O. Box 300, Princeton, N.J.andO;08543; 800-225-3170) offers the widest range of business wires in a singlepackage.andP;  But expect to pay more for it: During regular business hours,connect charges run from 70 cents to $2.90 per minute, compared with about 20cents per minute on CompuServe and 30 cents per minute on GEnie.andP;  Still, DowJones can deliver information about important patent filings, governmentcontracts awarded to your rival, changes in a competitor's credit rating orearnings forecast, product introductions or rumors of mergers andacquisitions.andP;  The easiest and cheapest way to clip articles from Dow Jonesis with NewsReal ($179), a front end for the service, from FNN DataBroadcasting (1900 S. Norfolk St., San Mateo, Calif.andP;  94403; 800-433-7068).andO;NewsReal creates a clipping folder, allows you to specify the companies andindustries you want to track and scans Dow Jones as often as four times a dayfor relevant stories.andP;  The program runs under Desqview 2.2 (and comes bundledwith a runtime version of it), so it can operate in the background.andP;  It'swonderfully easy to use and can save you a bundle in connect charges, as youpay only for the time it takes to download stories.andM;Clipping StrategiesandM;When assigning search words to any clipping service, cast your net wide.andO;Include not only your competitor's name, but the names of any suppliers andmajor customers you know.andP;  If the company is a takeover target (or a businesson the prowl for a subsidiary), track the stocks and market moves of thecompanies it could devour or be devoured by.andM;If you're trying to anticipate a new product, enter search words thatdescribe the product's technology or the names of the suppliers andsubcontractors your competitor might need to manufacture it.andM;If you're still not getting the coverage you need, go to an outside source.andO;Western Union offers the Executive Briefing Service, which scans more than900 databases, including those on Standard andamp; Poor's News, Reuters andBusiness Wire, which are available through the company's InfoMaster gateway.andO;A Western Union staff member asks you about the topics you want to follow, soyou needn't trouble yourself with arcane search languages.andP;  The service thendrops a weekly summary briefing into your e-mail box (or sends it by fax orhard copy) each Monday morning.andP;  It costs $595 a month.andP;  (Contact WesternUnion Corp., One Lake St., 4-11, Upper Saddle River, N.J.andP;  07458;800-422-4664 or 215-526-2860.)andM;Also, traditional clipping services (they typically cost between $50 and $200a month) will cover local news, which you can't get from an online source.andO;If your competitor purchases a 60-acre tract of land next to its currentfactory, for example, it could signify expansion.andP;  Dow Jones won't carry thatstory; the local paper might.andM;II.andP;  PROFILES OF YOUR RIVALSandM;WHILE ELECTRONIC clipping services will help you avoid surprises, you'llultimately want to predict your competitor's moves by analyzing trends inmarket share, profits and other criteria.andP;  This requires building detailedprofiles of your rival.andP;  Begin by collecting basic intelligence about sales,revenues, profits, markets and lines of products.andP;  You can get it fromseveral database services; the best include BRS, CompuServe, Dialog, DowJones, Nexis and NewsNet.andM;Each service offers gateways to key CI databases.andP;  Most of these serviceshave front ends that make searching relatively easy.andP;  One-stop shopping comesat a cost, however: Besides connect charges, you also have to pay searchcharges for each database.andP;  The charges vary widely (from nothing to $200 anhour), and some databases charge for each report, article or profile that youdownload.andM;Front ends to the services help you minimize connect charges in addition tomaking searching easier.andP;  Some are standalone software packages that you haveto buy; others come with the service.andP;  IQuest, for example, is CompuServe'sgateway to more than 700 databases and features a front end for searching.andM;DowQuest, which accompanies your Dow Jones subscription, lets you type a wordor phrase in plain English and translates it into the appropriate querylanguage.andP;  It also adapts your requests, helping you to refine your focus.andM;Pro-Search, a $495 standalone, menu-driven program from PersonalBibliographic Software (P.O.andP;  Box 425, Ann Arbor, Mich.andP;  48105;313-996-1580), is a front end for Dialog and BRS.andP;  Build your search termsoffline in plain English, and ProSearch logs on, selects databases andperforms the search.andP;  Its cost-accounting feature records searches by client,subject, date or search description.andM;Like Pro-Search, Nexis News Plus ($50), from Mead Data Central (P.O.andP;  Box933, Dayton, Ohio 45401; 800-229-9597), lets you create your searches offlineand download the &quot;hits&quot; automatically.andP;  You select a category and the programsuggests the databases to search.andM;Profiling ProfitandM;Though all front ends will make your searches easier and more efficient, beselective about which service you use for each database.andP;  Disclosure 11, forexample, is a gem for profiling your competitor, since the database includesSEC filings of more than 8,500 public companies.andP;  It's available on allservices but cheapest on CompuServe.andM;Disclosure II lets you retrieve the names of your competitor's officers,ownership and subsidiary information, its balance sheets for the past twoyears, three years of annual income statements, a quarterly income statementand a five-year business summary.andM;Profiling private companies is trickier and more expensive because they don'thave to file with the SEC.andP;  Dun andamp; Bradstreet, however, has accumulated awealth of information on more than 2 million private companies.andP;  The data isavailable through Dunsprint, a limited version of the company's own service,via CompuServe.andP;  It lets you in on a competitor's sales, balance sheets,income and credit, law firm and company officers and directors.andM;Costs range from $18 to $74 per report and $134 per hour for connect charges.andO;Dandamp;B's own service costs no more to use, and you get access to the fulldatabase, but it doesn't include a searching front end.andP;  You'll savefrustration and money by learning Dunsprint on CompuServe, then buying asubscription to Dandamp;B.andM;You can get much the same information from TRW's Business Profiles (availableon NewsNet, an excellent CI service known primarily for its 400-plusfull-text industry newsletters).andP;  It's less expensive ($36 per report, plus$84-per-hour connect charges) and almost as thorough as Dandamp;B's credit reports.andO;It includes intelligence on numerous private companies, including payment andcredit histories, and facts about tax liens and bankruptcies.andM;The best source on foreign firms comes from CompuServe's Worldscope(available on Dow Jones as well).andP;  Each report lists a company's keyofficers, number of shareholders and common shares outstanding, net income,sales, four years of balance sheets and income statements, growth rates,financial ratios and accounting practices.andM;Stock analysts' reports-including basic revenue and sales data--on majorforeign firms are available on Investext, via Dialog, Dow Jones, CompuServeand NewsNet.andP;  CompuServe is much cheaper for both Investext ($11 per report)and Worldscope (you pay only CompuServe's connect charges).andM;Asia watchers can use the Nexis Lexis Financial Information Service database,which includes company reports from two Japanese investment analysis houseson several hundred of the largest Asian companies.andP;  It costs $6 to $35 persearch, so try to get the information from Investext first.andP;  Dialog offersthe Inter Company Comparisons (ICC) database, which contains informationsimilar to what you'll find on Disclosure but for British firms, at $84 anhour (Dialog Information Services, 3460 Hillsview Ave., Palo Alto, Calif.andO;94304; 800-334-2564).andM;To Market, to MarketandM;Financial profiling should help you spot trends in your competitor's sales,market share, cash flow and other essentials.andP;  But you'll also want adetailed profile of its market.andM;Two key sources for market intelligence come from Investext, which includesmore than 200,000 securities analysts' reports on over 12,000 publiccompanies, and NewsNet, known for its industry newsletters.andP;  Contact NewsNetat 945 Haverford Road, Bryn Mawr, Pa.andP;  19010; (800) 345-1300.andM;Investext draws its reports from more than 90 of the best-knownsecurities-analyst firms in the world.andP;  Besides objective data about a firm'smarket share, gross margins on sales, research and development expenditures,cash flow and other figures, you get analysts' opinions of a company'sfuture.andP;  These can yield insight into marketing strategy, corporate culture,sales and market-share prospects and product line analysis.andP;  The intelligenceis particularly valuable when you combine several reports.andM;Unfortunately, Investext's fees are exorbitant and their structurelabyrinthine: Charges range from $12.50 an hour and $11 per report page onCompuServe to $195 per hour and $1.25 per 1,000 characters on Dow Jones.andO;Reports run from 2 to 10 pages.andM;If you simply want analysts' reports on specific companies, call Investext'stoll-free number (800-662-7878) and let the company do the searching.andP;  You'llreceive hard copy for $4.95 per report page; at that price, it's cheaper tohave someone key the information into your machine.andP;  If you want to searchacross product groups, industries or other categories, use CompuServe.andO;Identify the reports you want and download them on Dialog.andM;NewsNet offers glimpses of your competitor's market through its industrynewsletters.andP;  Because newsletters cut across such a broad swath of subjects,they can be a splendid source of facts on your competitor's marketing mix,channels of distribution, R and D and plans for expansion or acquisitions.andM;Add to NewsNet's $90-per-hour connect charges (2400 baud) full-text chargesthat vary among newsletters (the average is $45 per hour).andP;  The service'sinterface is easy enough to navigate without a front end, and it's fast aswell.andM;You can save connect time and your own time with NewsNet's clipping service,NewsFlash.andP;  Don't treat it like other clipping services; at $90 an hour, it'sfar more costly.andP;  Keep your search words to company names, product names orhighly specific technologies and industries.andP;  NewsFlash lets you specifywhich databases you wish it to scan.andP;  Limit these to industry newsletters;let a cheaper service, such as CompuServe, scan the business wires.andM;NewsFlash can help you follow your competitor's product introductions aswell, since fledgling technologies reported in industry newsletters oftenforeshadow actual products.andM;From the Factory FloorandM;To round out your competitor's profile, you'll want detailed information onits product line, including labor costs, intellectual property and suppliers.andM;The PR Newswire, available on NewsNet (access it from CompuServe; you payonly connect charges), can help you track trends in product debuts, such asthe number of NiCad-powered cellular phones introduced in the last sixmonths.andP;  The PR Newswire's information value is spotty, however, and requiresTalmudic analysis to derive any real intelligence.andM;A better source of product intelligence is the Patents database in Dialog(CLAIMS/U.S.andP;  PATENTS), which covers 40 years of U.S.andP;  patents and contains1.7 million records.andP;  Nexis's Patents database includes 14 years of filings.andO;Dialog costs $140 an hour; Nexis costs range from $12 to $42 per search.andO;Search by competitor's name, date of filing or expiration date; you won't,however, get graphical diagrams or much technical description.andP;  Use theseservices only as indexes; get actual patent information from the U.S.andP;  PatentOffice.andM;Thomas Register Online, available through Dialog, lets you search on morethan 50,000 products and 148,000 manufacturers by product name, company nameor SIC code.andP;  If you know the names of your competitor's suppliers but don'tknow what they supply (or vice versa), Thomas Register can often tell you.andO;This can yield clues to product introductions or let you know if yourcompetitor gets a better price on supplies than you do.andP;  Thomas RegisterOnline costs $1.67 per minute plus $1.50 for each full profile you view(through Dialog).andM;III.andP;  SHARPLY FOCUSED RESEARCHandM;AS YOUR PROFILES gain complexity and depth, you'll want your intelligence toaddress specific problems.andP;  You may need to solve a riddle: Why did acompeting firm have a management shakeup last quarter, when its profits weresoaring? Perhaps you'll wonder if your rival is on the make for anacquisition.andP;  Several databases can help you answer these kinds of directquestions.andM;Company OfficersandM;Nothing is more ominous than when a company's officers buy or sell hugechunks of stock in their own firm.andP;  Insider Watch, available on Dow JonesNews/Retrieval (for $35 a year, plus $1.93 per minute, 30 cents per 1,000characters and $9 per company report) and on Dialog, reports open marketsales and purchases and the stock options exercised by over 100,000 corporateinsiders in more than 8,500 of the largest American firms.andM;Dialog also provides the best way to learn who your competitor's officersare.andP;  Begin with Standard andamp; Poor's Register--Biographical.andP;  It includes morethan 70,000 concise biographies of prominent business leaders, includingtheir background, education and business and fraternal affiliations.andP;  Itcosts $1.40 per minute, $2 to view.andM;Three other databases available through Dialog can help you gatherintelligence on key players.andP;  Biography Master Index ($1.30 per minute, 90cents to view) includes more than 7 million biographical references in Who'sWho style.andP;  The Corporate Affiliations database lists not only corporateofficers but the number of employees, the corporate structure and the namesof directors for more than 40,000 companies.andP;  It costs $84 an hour.andM;Production and DistributionandM;Business Dateline, available on Dow Jones, BRS, Dialog and Nexis, coversregional business publications.andP;  These typically offer more detailedinformation about a company's production and distribution than do nationalpublications.andP;  They're also a good source on smaller companies.andP;  Articlestypically cite information only a smaller publication would pick up, such asmiddle-management personnel changes.andP;  BRS is your best bet for BusinessDateline.andP;  Contact Maxwell Online at 8000 Westpark Drive, MeLean, Va.andP;  22102;(703) 442-0900.andM;The PTS collection of databases, available on Dialog and BRS, is aninvaluable source for updates on technology, acquisitions, sales strategiesand product modifications.andP;  PTS's New Product Announcements deliver more than135,000 full-text press releases.andP;  Its Prompt database includes bothabstracts and full-text articles on more than 1.5 million products,technologies and markets.andP;  PTS Fandamp;S Indexes steers you toward more productionand distribution information by citing 3 million business periodicalsworldwide.andM;Corporate StructureandM;Business Dateline and Corporate Affiliations can reveal how public companiesare organized.andP;  DMS Market Intelligence Reports, on Dialog ($174 an hour),covers the worldwide military marketplace-where corporate structures areoften inconceivably large.andM;Financial Industry Information Service (FINIS), on Dialog, Nexis and BRS,cites more than 90,000 articles on financial institutions.andP;  Mandamp;A Filings, onDialog, is terrific on corporate organization if the company is a merger oracquisition target.andP;  And Standard andamp; Poor's Register--Corporate can yielduseful results; get it on CompuServe ($12.50).andM;Government ContractsandM;Commerce Business Daily, on Dialog, tracks civil contracts of $25,000 or moreand military contracts of $100,000 or more.andP;  It also lists governmentprocurements of supplies, services and equipment.andP;  DMS Contract Awards, alsoon Dialog, covers essentially the same ground.andM;New LeadsandM;If a service can't give you full-text intelligence on a specific question, itmay direct you to another source.andP;  ABI/Inform, available on BRS, Dialog andNexis, contains nearly half a million citations to business periodicals,including many relatively obscure journals that may contain revealing bits ofinformation.andM;Frost andamp; Sullivan Research Reports and Corporate and Industry Research Reportsoffer abstracts of analysts' reports on more than 50,000 companies.andP;  Bothservices are available on Dialog.andM;The Competitor Intelligence LibraryandM;Directory of Online Databases $175 per year (includes two main issues and twoupdates per year)andM;This comprehensive source describes more than 4,000 databases, 1,900 databasevendors and 600 online services by subject, producer, gateway, vendor andother criteria.andM;Cuadra/ElsevierandM;655 Avenue of the AmericasandM;Now York, N.Y.andP;

 You won't find themon any supermarket service.andP;  Yet they contain some of the best competitorintelligence available.andP;  The only reasonable way to get to them is to hire aninformation broker.andM;Brokers typically have an advanced degree  in library science.andP;  Intimate witharcane search languages, they know which databases to search for certainkinds of information.andP;  At $50 to $100 an hour plus connect charges, however,their work doesn't come cheap.andP;  And you con't verify the speed orthoroughness of their searching skills--even after they hand you the results.andM;Your only safeguard is to hire smart.andP;  The directory of Fee-Based informationServices (see &quot;The Competitor intelligence Library,&quot; page 162) lists morethan 20 information brokers who specialize in competitor intelligence.andP;  Thesedays, according to Helen Burwell, publisher of the directory, academiccredentials are less important than expertise in o given field.andP;  &quot;Find outhow much they know about your industry, not specific databases,&quot; she advises.andM;Also, plan for and insist upon an extensive interview with a prospectivebroker.andP;  Robert D. Aaron, president of Aaron/Smith Associates, an informationbrokerage firm that specializes in CI, suggests that you con learn a lotabout brokers by the questions they ask you.andP;  &quot;People often to come to uswith a vague, unformed question about a competitor.andP;  We try to make thatquestion operational; to focus it, to put it in a box.andP;  This  helps ourclients refine their thinking, and it ensures that everyone  is happy withthe results.&quot;andM;You'll also want to demystify the process by knowing specifically how thebroker plans to tackle a project.andP;  Ask about possible key phrases, how thesearch will be narrowed, the expected number of passes and other details.andO;Lelia Kight, president of Washington Researchers, a CI consulting firm,recommends that the broker deliver sources along with information.andM;Finally, ask for projected costs and references.andP;  The Association of PublicData Users can be tremendously useful for checking references or seeking areferral.andP;  Contact the APDU at 87 Prospect Ave., Princeton, N.J.andP;  08544;(609) 258-6025.andP;  Also, Section 4 of CompuServe's Working from Home Forum isdedicated to information brokers.andP;  it's a good place to get answers to yourquestions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
