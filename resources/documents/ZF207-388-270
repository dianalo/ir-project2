a base model includes the 200 Watt powersupply, the motherboard which holds up to 8Mb of high-speed interleaved RAM,six expansion slots, two serial ports, one parallel port, a fixed disk andfloppy interface and keyboard and mouse ports; populated, a 20MHz 1Mb 80286system with floppy drive, 16-bit VGA adaptor and colour VGA monitor is$2,760; the same system with a 25MHz 80386 CPU would cost $3,560.andM;-  o  -andM;Tempest Technologies Inc, Herndon, Virginia spacialist in the artandM;of keeping computer equipment electrically quiet so that eavesdroppers arestymied in attempts to pick up stray radiations, has a new Integrator Series,a set of rugged, militarised, radiation shielded housings designed to acceptabout 80% of the personal computer and workstation motherboards currently onthe market: it consists of the main chassis in a desk top, tower orrack-mount configuration and a colour monitor, keyboard, and a variety ofTempested peripherals are available; the first package using an 80386AT-alike with 1Mb memory, colour monitor, floppy disk and a 32Mb removeablehard drive.andM;-  o  -andM;In line with the current vogue for name changing among ATandamp;TandM;Network Systems International subsidiaries in various countries, APT-EspanaSA has changed its name to ATandamp;T Network Systems Espana SA: the joint venturecompany, which is 51% held by ATandamp;T Network, with local Spanish firm Amper SAowning the remaining 49%, develops and manufactures advanced transmissionequipment for use in telecommunications networks.andM;-  o  -andM;American Mitac Corp is claiming to be the US price leader for AT-andM;alikes with a $1,000 80286-based machine, that price buying the MPC2000SLwith one 5.25&quot;

with respect to operating systems that are designed to run MS-DOSapplications, because they usually find that their favourite programs are thevery ones that fall outside the scope of the compatibility, but StonglineInc, Mountain View, California will soon be touting Wendin-DOS 2.5, &quot;amulti-user, multi-tasking operating system&quot; from the Spokane, Washington-based Wendin Inc that is claimed to be &quot;highly compatible with PC-DOS andMS-DOS applications&quot;; Strongline is also taking on PCVMS version 2.5,described as a self-bootable, multi-tasking, multi-user operating system thatprovides a VAX/VMS-style environment for MS-DOS machines, running &quot;most&quot;MS-DOS programs on the main console and including Wendin's ApplicationDeveloper's Kit in the $140 price;

EROShopes that trade on the service will span up to 1,000 record shops by 1992,including some 300 chain stores.andM;-  o  -andM;NeXT Inc has been taking Newsbytes among others on a tour of itsandM;Fremont, California factory, and the newswire found it something of aneye-opener, even compared with the highly automated Apple Computer Inc plantin the same California township: the black- windowed exterior hides a placewhere only 12 people need be employed to watch over 165 feet of assembly lineon which NeXT motherboards &quot;literally assemble themselves&quot;; by comparisonwith Apple's &quot;islands of automation,&quot; NeXT's &quot;integrated manufacturing&quot; needsroughly one fifth the number of people, and individual NeXT Computer Systemis touched by no more than one or two people from the circuit board level tothe finished product; the automation is claimed to enable the printed circuitboards to be surface-mounted at the rate of 150 parts per minute, and resultsin a soldering defect rate of 16 parts per million - just 10% of the industryaverage; with only 40 people in the entire company, 70% have advanced collegedegrees (is Steve Jobs the only college drop-out?) and when productionreaches peak in the autumn, NeXT does not expect to have to add more than adozen new workers.andM;-  o  -andM;The packet radio communications slice for Mountain View,andM;California-based Agilis Inc's new lap-top uses spread spectrum technology toenable the portable to communicate with a base station over a broad radioband to minimise reception and transmission problems, and operates over up to1,000 yards outdoors or 100 yards in a building.andM;-  o  -andM;Alpharel Inc, Camarillo, California has a $1.7m contract fromandM;Apple Computer Inc for the expansion of an image management system, whichcomes in addition to the $1m contract at the end of 1988;

thetwo companies each have 40% of the new software firm, with the remainder inthe hands of Indian investors.andM;-  o  -andM;With Amdahl Corp and Storage Technology Corp both makingandM;substantial storage announcements yesterday (see front page), both clearlybelieved the widespread gossip that IBM had inked in yesterday for its &quot;3990&quot;disk drive announcements, which in the last we heard might have been putright back to the autumn because of the non-appearance of the dual-writefeature for the 3990-3 disk controller; StorageTek's new productannouncements got short shrift in today's issue because it limped in too latefor a full rundown; fuller details of it will be provided in a future issue.andM;-  o  -andM;Data General Corp has sold its Sunnyvale, California waferandM;fabrication facility to Rohm Co Ltd, leasing back a part of it, and sold theequipment therein to Exar Corp, for $18.5m in total, which will leave it witha $6.3m pre-tax gain with its fiscal third quarter figures.andM;-  o  -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co plans to retain all but 100 employees who heldandM;corporate positions at the the former Apollo Computer Inc's Chelmsford,Mass., headquarters facility, but that of the 500 headquarters employees,about 150 people hold positions that are not normally needed in a productdivision, and it looks to to place about 50 of them elsewhere within thecompany;

the nearest IBMhas been able to get is to register the name Big Blue Ribbons (what?), but isbanging down on companies like Softdisk, which publishes the Big Blue Diskmagazine-on-a-floppy, and according to Newsbytes has been doing so since1986; IBM is also making the life of a Northport, Long Island company, BigBlue Products Inc a misery, claiming in that case that it trademarked BigBlue last year, and that the five- person office supplies business isconfusing the public and harming IBM, giving it 30 days to drop the name orelse; when the Armonkeys have settled that one, they'd better rush out andget a trademark on the tag I'm Big Mother before Big Mother stores startbursting out all over.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
