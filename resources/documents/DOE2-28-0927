An area called 1002 is a thin slice of coastal plain,30 miles wide and 100 miles long, located between snow-clad mountainsand the permanent pack ice of the Beaufort Sea. This are comprises onetwelfth of the refuge and is the breeding ground for many birds and mammals.However, geologists have reason to believe that this area is rich inoil reserves.
