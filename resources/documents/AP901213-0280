The Dallas-based owner of 7-Eleven convenience stores is thelargest of a handful of companies to reorganize under Chapter 11 ofthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code with a plan that has already been approvedby most of its creditors.   Southland filed a ``prepackaged'' Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan inOctober. The company, which had sales of almost $8 billion lastyear, said it was overwhelmed by debt left from its $4.9 billionleveraged buyout in 1987.   The filing listed $2.53 billion in assets and $3.38 billion inliabilities.   Typically, a company files for Chapter 11 protection and thenpresents a judge with a reorganization plan that must be approvedby creditors, a time-consuming process.   Southland officials believe prepackaging will allow the companyto get through the bankruptcy within six months.   ``A prepackaged bankruptcy offered us the potential ofcompleting the Chapter 11 process much more quickly, and wouldtherefore be much less disruptive to our business,'' said CeciliaStubbs Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman.   Attorneys for Southland and creditors who have approved the planwill argue its merits before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramsonon Friday. Some related issues regarding the sale of a Dallasskyscraper Southland built are to be argued before Abramson nextweek.   The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to ask the judgefor another 45 days to review Southland's case, agency spokesmanJohn Heine said in Washington. The SEC believes Southland's casewill set a precedent for prepackaged bankruptcy proceedings andmerits a lengthier review, Heine said.   Southland first proposed a restructuring last March, when itannounced the sale of most of the company to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd.and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., its Japanese affiliates. Thebuyers would provide $430 million in new cash for stock in thereorganized company.   Prepackaging is receiving greater use since Merv Griffin'sResorts International Inc. used a form of it last year. DonaldTrump is using a prepackaged plan in the restructuring announcedthis month of his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J.Lettering-machine maker Kroy Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., has alsofiled a prepackaged bankruptcy proposal.   To make a prepackaged filing, a company must get thereorganization approved by at least 50 percent of the bondholdersholding at least two-thirds of the debt. If a judge approves, theterms of the plan are then imposed on the dissenting minority.   That makes prepackaging a powerful weapon for creditors againstthe holdouts who will never approve a company's reorganizationplan, hoping instead for separate, often better, terms.   ``The prepackaged plan is a nice, balanced way of givingcreditors say so in the future and permitting the company toreorganize in a rapid, efficient way,'' said Dallas attorney MarkMacDonald, who helped Republic Health Corp. reorganize in such away.   Republic, a Dallas-based owner of 14 hospitals, filed aprepackaged Chapter 11 plan last December to restructure debt ittook on in a 1986 leveraged buyout. Republic emerged frombankruptcy in April and earned a profit during its last quarter of1990, which ended Aug. 31.   Companies with operational problems or strife between manycreditors could not use prepackaging to reorganize, said New Yorkbankruptcy attorney Steven R. Gross, who also represented RepublicHealth.   There are also dangers in prepackaging, such as a mistake beingmade outside the court's view and then not detected until a judge'sonly alternative is to order a new filing.   But a prepackaged bankruptcy may give a restructuring company aboost before a judge, Gross said.   ``(When) a bankruptcy judge (is) looking at a prepackaged planor taking the risk of two or three years of bankruptcy for acompany, ... the judge is going to err on the side of getting thatcompany out,'' Gross said.   ``If everyone is sitting there saying `Let's go,' that's veryhard to resist,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
