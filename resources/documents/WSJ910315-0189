Soybean prices were also depressed by reports that anunidentified hog disease is erupting in Germany and theNetherlands. U.S. grain exporters are concerned that a severeoutbreak of the disease, which is causing some sows to aborttheir litters, could reduce herds there to the extent thatdemand for U.S. soybeans as a feed ingredient might drop.</LP><TEXT>   On the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean contract forMarch delivery plunged 12.75 cents a bushel to settle at$5.7375.   The cloudy U.S. export picture, combined with an earliergovernment report of larger-than-expected soybean stockpiles,has combined to reduce soybean prices about 4% so far thisweek.   According to U.S. grain traders, South American exportersare beginning to cut their prices on grains and soybeans tobelow U.S. levels. The move is a typical tactic during theharvest season, which is beginning there.   Exporters in Argentina, for example, reportedly reducedthe price of a bushel of corn to 11 to 15 cents less than theprice of a bushel of corn exported from a U.S. Gulf of Mexicoport.   The Argentinian exporters are expecting a big corn harvestof roughly 283 million bushels. Because of a tight supply ofstorage space, grain handlers sometimes lower prices to movethe corn rapidly overseas.   The move, however, might also signal that South Americanexporters are attempting to increase their share of worldtrade.   The soybean harvest in Brazil is expected to drop about15% this year to roughly 625 million bushels because ofreduced planting and dry weather. Nonetheless, exportersthere are reportedly offering a bushel of soybeans at about20 cents below the price of a bushel of U.S. soybeans forexport.   U.S. traders aren't clear about the seriousness of the hogdisease outbreak. So far, the outbreak hasn't influenced theprice of U.S. hogs -- and it probably wouldn't unless thedisease spreads to Denmark, a major pork exporter.   Although some traders are concerned that demand forsoybean meal might fall in regions affected by the disease,analysts say that hog farmers in the Netherlands and Germanyrepresent a small fraction of the U.S.'s soybean business.Soybean meal is a primary ingredient in hog rations.   An Agriculture Department spokeswoman said that U.S.scientists haven't determined whether the disease is relatedto the so-called mystery swine disease that materialized inthe U.S. in the late 1980s. That disease has killed tens ofthousands of U.S. pigs and causes sows to abort.   By the middle of February, according to the spokeswoman,officials in Europe had already taken steps to isolate morethan 700 German hog herds and 100 hog herds in theNetherlands.   Wheat prices also sank yesterday on an increased chance ofrain this weekend in parched wheat-growing areas of thesouthern Plains.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures markets seemed to be looking forsomething to happen yesterday, but nothing did. Petroleumprices on the New York Mercantile Exchange drifted lower inthin trading. The market, driven for months by news out ofthe Persian Gulf and early this week by the first postwarmeeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,had nothing of that caliber to focus on. Crude oil for Aprildelivery lost 18 cents a barrel to end the session at $20.27.There were two generally bullish pronouncements -- one froman oil-consuming nation, the other from an oil-exportingnation -- about price trends over the next several months. W.Calvin Kilgore, director of the U.S. Department of Energy'sOffice of Energy Markets, said at a futures industryconference that his agency sees crude hovering between $15and $20 a barrel through 1992. Similarly, VenezuelanPresident Carlos Andres Perez said in a report to the nationthat oil prices will average $19 a barrel this year.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. Sugar for May delivery ended0.23 cent higher at 9.19 cents a pound. A sale of white sugarby India overnight removed some excess supply from themarket, analysts said. India previously rejected three bidsfor the sugar as too low, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst atShearson Lehman Brothers. Traders had expected the sale tototal 200,000 tons, but only 60,000 tons was sold, leadingtraders to surmise that India doesn't have as much availableas they had thought, she said. In addition, &quot;the market saw{that the sugar} was easily absorbed,&quot; said Harri Schwartz,an analyst at Cargill Investor Services. A report that 1991sugar acreage in Europe is estimated to be down slightly fromlast year also contributed to the price increase, Ms. Kaulsaid. She added that that sugar &quot;looks like it's headingtoward 10 cents&quot; a pound.                                                                                                          COPPER: The slow pace of industrial activity continued toweigh on the market. After trading as low as $1.062 a pound,the May contract ended at $1.073, down 0.40 cent. For thepast few weeks, domestic business has been extremely quiet,said Fred D'Agostino, president of Metal Resources Inc., aRiverside, Conn., trading and consulting firm. &quot;Copperconsumers are ordering what they need, which is a little lessthan what they needed a few months ago,&quot; he said. The onebullish aspect about copper is low supplies, he said; thereare concerns that if the U.S. economy recovers quickly, therewon't be enough stock to fill demand. But for the moment, hesaid, the market &quot;remains in limbo.&quot; John E. Gross, a WestNyack, N.Y., metals consultant, said that labor problems overthe next few months in producing countries could disruptcopper supplies. Miners in Peru have announced they willstrike to protest mine closures, and major labor contracts inCanada and Chile are due to expire in May and June,respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
