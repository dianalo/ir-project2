The bombingdisrupted supplies to the city the guerrillas chose as their firstmajor objective after the Soviet withdrawal.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said three other roads, all unpavedand more circuitous, remained open to military convoys between Kabuland the strategic city 75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass.   Mohammad Nabi Amani told reporters the bridge near Sarobi, aboutmidway between the capital and Jalalabad, was destroyed Tuesday byexplosives planted on the span. He said the bridge was one of about100 on the paved highway.   Moslem insurgents based in Pakistan and supported by the UnitedStates launched their offensive around the eastern city March 6 buthave not succeeded in dislodging government troops.   Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under aU.N.-mediated agreement, after more than nine years of directinvolvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April1978.   Kabul's airport is the terminus for military supplies from theSoviet Union, which the Kremlin-sponsored government says willcontinue arriving until the United States stops supplying theguerrillas.   Amani said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artilleryshells at government positions outside Jalalabad in the previous 24hours.   No government soldiers were killed, but five troopers and fivecivilians were wounded, he said. He claimed 89 guerrillas, includingfour local commanders, were killed in the same period.   Amani repeated his government's claims that Pakistani militarypersonnel were aiding the insurgents, who call themselvesmujahedeen, or holy warriors. Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbor tothe east, has denied such involvement.   In Moscow, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accusedPakistan of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in Afghanistan.   He said Pakistan had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreementby allowing the rebels to form an interim government on itsterritory. He also charged that arms were being delivered to therebels from the United States via Pakistan in violation of theaccord.   Shevardnadze noted a large number of Soviet civilian specialistsremained in Kabul as well as the staff of a large embassy. ``Anyattempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resoluteSoviet response,'' he said without elaboration.   In Pakistan, the Afghan News Agency operated by the Hezb-e-Islamirebel group of Gulbaddin Hekmatyar claimed army outposts north andwest of the city were captured.   Reports on casualties and the progress of fighting aroundJalalabad are impossible to verify from Kabul. Guerrillaheadquarters in Pakistan have reported far lower death tolls for themujahedeen.   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said soldiers were conducting a``mopping-up operation'' against insurgents near Khak-e-Jabbar, 15miles southeast of the capital on one of the alternate routes toJalalabad.   Blowing up the bridge could signal a change of mujahedeen tacticsin the 17-day-old battle for Jalalabad, which illustrates thedifficulty for guerrillas of direct confrontation with an army thathas air power and long-ange missiles.   Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from Kabul inthe direction of Jalalabad since the battle bagan, according toforeign observers and residents of Kabul. They have a range of atleast 175 miles.   A truck hauled three Scuds tightly wrapped in gray plasticthrough the center of the capital Thursday, accompanied by two othertrucks carrying canisters of fuel that must be attached to fire themissiles.   The trucks were seen on a major route from the airport, whereSoviet Ilyushin-76 transports land several times a day. The hugeplanes can carry 40 tons of cargo.   Thousands more Afghans have fled to Pakistan, further swelling arefugee population estimated at about 3.5 million. Refugee officialsin Peshawar said most were from villages in the Jalalabad area, notfrom the city.   Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hourcurfew on Jalalabad to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said theywere reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualtiesit would cause.</TEXT></DOC>
