Background </ITAG>On February 5, 1988, President Reagan approved the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242) (the Act). Title VI of the Actestablishes the Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program (NHOP). UnderNHOP, HUD is authorized to make grants to nonprofit organizations to enablethem to provide loans to families purchasing homes that are constructedor substantially rehabilitated in accordance with a HUD-approved program.On November 8, 1988 (53 FR 45216), HUD published a notice announcing proposedrules governing NHOP. HUD received 26 comments in response to the proposedrule. The issues raised by the commenters are summarized below. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Public Comments </ITAG>A. Statutory Constraints In many instances, commenters suggested revisions that conflict with thestatutory NHOP requirements. The statutorily impermissible suggestionswere: 1. Include Public Housing Authorities, entitlement cities under the CommunityDevelopment Block Grants program (CDBG program), and public nonprofit organizationsas eligible recipients. Section 603(a) states that HUD will provide assistanceunder the program to nonprofit organizations. Section 602(5) defines anonprofit organization as a private nonprofit corporation or other privatenonprofit legal entity that is approved by the Secretary as to financialresponsibility. While entities other than nonprofit organizations cannotbe recipients, they may assist the recipient in the development of a programin several different capacities. For example, the unit of general localgovernment must approve the proposed program (andSection;280.215(b)(5));public and private entities may contribute land necessary to make the programfeasible (andSection;280.220(b)(1)), or make other contributions that willreduce the cost to families of purchasing homes under the program (andSection;280.220(b)(2));and States and units of general local government may provide the firstmortgage under a home loan program in association with the program (andSection;280.320(1)(ii)).2. Redefine ``home'' to permit the development of large multifamily structures.Section 602(2) defines home as any one- to four-family dwelling. The termincludes any dwelling unit in a condominium project or cooperative projectconsisting of <T3>not more than four dwelling units, </T3>any townhouse, and any manufacturedhome. 3. Provide reimbursement of program costs to recipients. Section 604 providesthat recipients shall use assistance to provide loans to families purchasinghomes constructed or substantially rehabilitated under an approved program.No other use of NHOP funds is authorized by the statute. 4. Reduce the minimum program size requirements contained in proposed andSection;280.105(a).The minimum program size requirements reflect the statutory requirementscontained in section 606(e)(1). 5. Eliminate the requirement that the program must be located in Censustracts (or indentifiable neighborhoods within Census tracts) in which themedian family income is not more than 80 percent of the median family incomefor the area. Section 606(e)(3) imposes this requirement. 6. Revise the selection procedures to provide funds on an entitlement basis,rather than by a competitive selection. Section 607 imposes six statutoryselection criteria for the competitive ranking of applications. 7. Eliminate the ranking criterion that addresses the extent to which financialand other contributions will reduce the cost to families purchasing homesconstructed or substantially rehabilitated under a program. Use of thisranking criterion is required under section 607(a)(2). 8. Consider additional criteria in the ranking of applications. Suggestionsincluded such factors as the extent to which programs will develop singlefamily units or condominium projects, and the extent to which the applicationis consistent with, and advances the purposes of, the National HistoricPreservation Act. Section 607 specifies the six ranking criteria that HUDmust apply in the selection of applications. The statute does not authorizeHUD to go beyond the listed criteria. 9. Revise the provision that states that construction or substantial rehabilitationof homes (other than display homes) may not commence until 25 percent ofthe homes under the program are contracted for sale to purchasers who intendto live in the homes, and the required downpayments for such homes aremade. Proposed revisions included:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Eliminate the minimum participation requirement. Section 606(c) imposesthe requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">-Provide that a lease and time-limited option to purchase will satisfythe minimum participation requirement. Section 606(c) requires a contractfor sale. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Substitute various requirements (e.g., earnest money deposits) forthe requirement that the downpayment must be paid before the commencementof construction or substantial rehabilitation. Section 606(c) prohibitsconstruction until 25 percent of the units are contracted for sale andthe </ITAG><T3>required downpayments </T3>are made. Section 605(c)(1) requires downpaymentsof not less than 10 percent of the purchase price (except under the limitedcircumstances described below). <ITAG tagnum="15">_Apply the 25 percent downpayment requirement to </ITAG><T3>separate phases </T3>of the program. The minimum participation requirementunder section 606(c) requires that <T3>not less than </T3>25 percent of the homes to be constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated must be contracted for sale and the required downpaymentmade. 10. Provide more flexible income eligibility standards for purchasers.Except as described immediately below, section 605(b) requires that thefamily income on the date of purchase cannot exceed the higher of the medianincome for a family of four in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA)involved, <T3>or </T3>the national median income for a family of four. 11. Permit the modification of the income eligibility standard to permitup to <T3>25 </T3>percent of the families purchasing homes to have a family incomeon the date of purchase that is between 100 and 115 percent of the medianfamily income for the MSA. Under section 605(b)(1)(A), HUD may modify theincome eligibility standard in the MSA for up to <T3>15 </T3>percent of the families. 12. Reduce the downpayment required from the family purchasing a home underNHOP. Section 605(c) requires each family to make a downpayment of 10 percentof the sales price of the home unless the nonprofit organization determinesa higher downpayment to be appropriate, or the first mortgage on the homeis held by a State or unit of general local government and the programprovides for a lower downpayment. 13. Eliminate the requirement that the recipient must pay interest to familieson downpayments in situations where the cost of computing the interestwill exceed the interest payment. Section 605(c)(2) provides that downpaymentsshall accrue interest, from the date on which the downpayment is made throughsettlement, at a rate not less than the passbook rate, and that such interestshall be paid by the nonprofit organization to the family. 14. Increase the maximum amount of the NHOP loan. Section 604(b)(3) setsthe maximum loan amount at $15,000. 15. Permit the recipient to hold the second mortgage, make the loan repayableto the recipient, and permit the recipient to use repayments for variouspurposes. Section 604(b) states that the NHOP loan is to be secured bya second mortgage held by the Secretary and repayable to the Secretaryupon the sale, lease or transfer of the property. Repayments are includedin the Nehemiah Housing Opportunities revolving fund which is used by HUDto provide assistance to nonprofit organizations to carry out NHOP (seesection 609). B. Assistance Provided Under Other HUD Programs Except for assistance made available under the CDBG program, a recipient'sprogram is ineligible for assistance under other HUD programs. (Familiespurchasing homes, however, may be eligible for mortgage insurance undervarious HUD programs.) Two commenters argued that the prohibition againstthe use of other HUD funds, when combined with the $15,000 limitation onthe amount of the loan under andSection;280.322(a)(2), may be a serious impedimentto the development of some programs. The commenters urged HUD to permitrecipients to use other HUD funds where necessary to achieve feasibility.HUD has retained the prohibition. This provision is necessary to ensurethat the recipient, States, units of general local government, and othermembers of the community are committed to the development and operationof a successful program_an involvement that is essential to the successof any attempt to rebuild the depressed areas of the cities and to createsound and attractive neighborhoods. The provision also prevents undue relianceon assistance from the Federal government and makes sure that the mosteffective use is made of limited Federal funds. This prohibition is consistentwith the statutory emphasis on non-Federal funding (section 607(a)(3) ofthe Act provides that HUD will rank applications based on the extent towhich the program will produce the greatest number of housing units forthe least amount of NHOP assistance), and with the statute's emphasis onnon-Federal contributions of land, and financial and other contributions(see section 607(a) (1) and (2)). C. Program Eligibility Requirements1. <T3>Construction or substantial rehabilitation of homes.</T3> Assistanceunder NHOP is limited to programs that involve the construction or substantialrehabilitation of homes. Proposed andSection; 280.5 stated that a home wouldbe substantially rehabilitated if the rehabilitation costs exceed 60 percentof the maximum sales price of the home, or if the home to be rehabilitatedis a vacant, abandoned structure. At the request of a commenter, the definitionof substantial rehabilitation has been clarified to state that substantialrehabilitation is determined by reference to the maximum sales price ofthe home after rehabilitation. Additionally, the definition of rehabilitationhas been revised for clarity (e.g., the final rule includes the cost oftools as an eligible rehabilitation cost).2. <T3>Program size requirements.</T3> As noted above, programs must meetcertain minimum size limitations. The statute permits the Secretary towaive the program size limitations if the Governor of the State or theunit of general local government requests the waiver and certifies, withsupporting documentation, that the requirements would prevent the Stateor the unit of general local government from using the program effectively.HUD will determine that the program size requirement will prevent the effectiveuse of the program if three conditions are met. The final rule clarifiestwo of these conditions, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Under andSection; 280.105(b)(2), HUD will consider whether the constructionor substantial rehabilitation of a program of the proposed size will resultin cost reductions through economies of scale comparable to the cost reductionsachieved by other programs eligible under NHOP. The proposed rule includedexamples of cost reductions. These examples have been revised so that theyaddress only those cost reductions generated through economies of scale.A related provision at andSection; 280.110(b)(2)(ii) has also been revised.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Under andSection; 280.105(b)(3), HUD will consider whether the program,by itself or together with other improvement efforts, will result in asubstantial improvement in the overall quality and long term viabilityof the neighborhood. Improvement efforts may include the construction orrehabilitation of other structures, improvements to public facilities orservices or the expansion of private enterprise in the area. The finalrule specifies that improvement efforts include the construction and rehabilitationof a commercial property or an existing subdivision. A similar clarificationhas been made to a related provision at andSection; 280.110(b)(iii).</ITAG>3. <T3>Program location.</T3> (a) Neighborhood requirements. All homes constructedor substantially rehabilitated under NHOP must be concentrated in a singleneighborhood and located on contiguous parcels of land. Programs locatedin up to four neighborhoods are permitted if certain requirements are met.Under the proposed rule, ``neighborhood'' was defined as an area that (a)has a population of at least 2,500 persons, and (b) is distinguishablefrom other areas on the basis of one or more significant features, suchas: (1) Natural or man-made boundaries; (2) a locally recognized name,formal or informal; (3) an identity as a residential subdivision; (4) anidentity as an elementary school district; or (5) distinctive population,social, or housing characteristics. Several commenters urged HUD to eliminatethe minimum population requirement. These commenters argued that the requirementwill be difficult to meet in Western states and rural areas; other criteriaadequately define neighborhood; and the requirement will unnecessarilylimit NHOP flexibility. The final rule eliminates the minimum populationrequirement.Under proposed andSection; 280.110(b)(2), homes may be constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated in up to four identifiable neighborhoods, each of which consistsof contiguous parcels of land, provided certain conditions are met. Onecommenter observed that the proposed rule seemed to require all parcelsin a program to be contiguous, even if the program is located in multipleneighborhoods. The final rule clarifies that where a program is locatedin more than one neighborhood, all homes in the program are not requiredto be located on contiguous parcels of land, as long as all homes constructedor substantially rehabilitated within each neighborhood are located oncontiguous parcels of land.The proposed rule defined contiguous parcels of land as parcels of landthat abut, or if the parcels of land do not abut, parcels of land thatare divided only by natural or man-made boundaries (such as streets, rights-of-way,or similar divisions), and that are located within the same neighborhood(see proposed andSection; 280.5). Commenters objected that the proposed definitionwas too restrictive; would prevent the use of NHOP in many otherwise eligibleareas; and may result in the clearance of otherwise sound buildings inorder to permit a program that meets the contiguous requirement.In response to commenters' concerns, contiguous parcels of land has beendefined as parcels of land that: abut; are divided only by natural or man-madeboundaries (such as streets, rights-of-way, or similar divisions); <T3>or are closely located.</T3> Parcels will be considered to be closelylocated if: the majority of homes to be constructed or substantially rehabilitatedin the neighborhood are located on parcels that: abut; are divided by naturalor man-made boundaries (such as streets, rights-of-way, or similar divisions);or are divided only by a small number of lots that do not, in the Secretary'sdetermination, detract from the objective of fostering a concentrated effortto rebuild depressed areas and to create sound and attractive neighborhoods.The remaining homes to be constructed or substantially rehabilitated inthe neighborhood must be located on parcels in one or more areas, in whichthe parcels for each such subordinate area meet the same requirements thatthe main area must meet. The subordinate area or areas can be separatedfrom the main area by a distance, at the closest point, of no more thantwo city blocks (exclusive of any natural or man-made boundary).(b) Census tract or neighborhood income limitations. Section 606(e)(3)of the Act provides that programs must be located in Census tracts (oridentifiable neighborhoods within Census tracts) in which the median familyincome is not more than 80 percent of the median family income for thearea. Section 606(e)(3) also provides that ``median family income'' and``area'' (as determined for the purposes of assistance under section 8of the United States Housing Act of 1937) are to be used to determine whethera program meets the median family income requirements. In accordance withthese requirements, proposed andSection; 280.110(a)(1) stated that HUD woulduse median family incomes derived from the most recent decennial Censusand the areas established under Section 8 of the USHA of 1937 for the purposeof determining the median family income of the area in which the programis to be located.A commenter asked whether the median family income in high cost MSAs willbe limited to the national median income instead of the actual median incomefor the MSA. The commenter has confused <T3>median family income</T3> with the <T3>income limits</T3> for various family sizes, as established under section8. In the section 8 program, the <T3>income limits</T3> for various family sizes are based on the Department'sestimates of median family income. For most areas, the lower income limitfor a family of four is set at 80 percent of the median family income.Adjustments, however, are made to income limits in areas that have unusuallyhigh or low income to housing cost relationships. For example, in FY-1989the maximum income limit for a four-person family in several areas wascapped at the United States median family income of $34,000. HUD does not,however, adjust median family income on this basis.(c) Location in MSA. Section 605(b) of the Act contains the eligibilityrequirements for families purchasing homes under NHOP. Section 605(b)(1)(A)provides that the family must meet certain income requirements based onthe median family income for a family of four persons in the MSA involved.In the proposed rule, HUD determined that the family income provision implicitlyimposed the additional requirement that all programs must be located inan MSA (see proposed rule at andSection; 280.110(c)).Many commenters objected to the requirement. Commenters argued that theMSA requirement was contrary to legislative intent; that the proposed rulewould arbitrarily exclude rural areas from participation in NHOP; and thatthe inclusion of non-MSA areas would promote the purposes of NHOP, sincenon-MSAs have a great need for homeownership assistance and may not haveaccess to other Federal funding sources.Upon a review of the legislative history of NHOP, HUD agrees that the MSArequirement should be deleted. For example, the House Committee Report(H.R. Rep. No. 100-122, 100 Cong. 1st Sess. 96-97 (1987)) stated that purchaserslocated in non-MSAs would be subject to certain income eligibility requirements.The House Report also explained that the minimum size requirements containedin the legislation had been reduced in order to provide assistance in smallercities. Moreover, during Senate consideration of NHOP, Senator Nicklesexpressed concern that assistance would not be provided within certainStates, in cities with populations under 20,000, and in rural areas. SenatorD'Amato explained that such programs would be required to provide a minimumof 50 homes, but would not be precluded from participation. 134 Cong. Rec.S4158-59 (Daily Ed. March 31, 1987). Also see 134 Cong. Rec. S4197-98.In accordance with this change, the eligibility of families purchasinghomes in programs that are <T3>not</T3> located in MSAs will be determined by reference to the nationalmedian income. The eligibility of families purchasing homes in programsthat are located in MSAs will continue to be determined by reference tothe higher of the national or MSA median income. As a related matter, thefollowing changes have been made in the final rule:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The requirement that applicants must identify the MSA in which theprogram will be located has been deleted (andSection; 280.205(b)(2)(i)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The requirement that applicants must provide evidence of a demandfor homes in the MSA has been revised to require a showing of need withinthe area to be served by the program (andSection;andSection; 280.205(b)(4)and 280.215(b)(4)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The ranking criterion that requires HUD to consider the degree towhich each program will produce the maximum number of homes for the leastassistance, taking into account the cost differences among different MSAs,has been revised to refer to cost differences between different marketareas (andSection; 280.220(b)(3)). Similarly, the ranking criterion thatrequires HUD to consider the extent to which the applicant will use constructionor rehabilitation methods that will reduce the cost per square foot belowthe average construction cost per square foot in the MSA has been revisedto refer to the average construction cost per square foot in the marketarea of the program (andSection; 280.220(b)(5)). Construction cost data andmarket areas will be determined by reference to the commercial constructioncost indices that will be announced in a NOFA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The provision governing the minimum interest rate to be paid to familieson downpayments has been revised to refer to the rates offered within theState, rather than within the MSA.</ITAG>D. <T3>Application and Selection Process</T3>1. <T3>Application requirements.</T3> The proposed rule prohibited applicationsjointly submitted by two or more entities (see definition of applicantat andSection; 280.5). The final rule has been revised to permit applicationsjointly submitted by two or more nonprofit organizations.Minimum application requirements are described at andSection; 280.205. Onecommenter argued that andSection; 280.205(b)(2)(iii), which requires thesubmission of architectural drawings, imposes unnecessary expenses on applicants.The commenter suggested that HUD permit applicants to submit architecturaldrawings or detailed work write-ups, as appropriate. The commenter hasmisunderstood the proposed application requirement. This section does notrequire the submission of detailed working drawings. Rather, it requiresarchitectural drawings of the site (i.e., site plans) and the floor plansfor some typical units. The provision is revised for clarity.2. <T3>Other Federal requirements.</T3> Proposed andSection; 280.207 addressedother applicable Federal requirements, including nondiscrimination andequal opportunity requirements; lead-based paint requirements; flood insurancepurchase requirements; requirements of OMB Circulars governing the acceptanceand use of assistance by nonprofit organizations; conflict of interestprovisions; provisions applicable to the use of debarred, suspended orineligible contractors; and audit requirements.(a) <T3>Relocation assistance. </T3>One commenter objected that the proposedrule did not contain relocation assistance provisions for persons displacedas a result of NHOP. The commenter asserted that the absence of relocationpayments has brought the prototype Nehemiah program in New York to a standstill.The commenter argued that a system for the prompt payment of adequate relocationbenefits must be imposed. The commenter requested that HUD provide a 60-daypublic comment period for such relocation requirements, or delay publicationof the final rule until rules are published implementing the changes tothe Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition PoliciesAct of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA) that were made by the UniformRelocation Act Amendments of 1987, Title IV of the Surface Transportationand Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17, approvedApril 2, 1987). Effective April 2, 1989, certain relocation assistancerequirements apply to programs or projects that involve acquisition, rehabilitation,or demolition, and that receive Federal financial assistance. When the proposed NHOP rule was published, HUD, with the Department ofTransportation as the lead agency, was engaged in formulating uniform government-wideURA regulations for Federal and federally assisted programs. Accordingly,the proposed NHOP rule did not include relocation provisions. HUD, however,stated that the NHOP final rule would address the applicability of theURA, and would include appropriate relocation provisions implementing the1987 amendments. The government-wide rule was published on March 2, 1989(54 FR 8912). HUD does not anticipate that approved programs will cause a significantamount of displacement. The statute provides that NHOP funds may be usedonly for <T3>loans </T3>to families purchasing homes under an approved program.Thus, the recipient, not HUD, will be required to fund relocation paymentsthrough the sales price of the homes or through financial and other contributionsto the program. To the extent that recipients will develop such programs,HUD has added the following relocation provisions to the final rule atandSection;280.207(b):<ITAG tagnum="15">_The URA and government-wide implementing regulations at 49 CFR Part24 set forth relocation assistance requirements that apply to the displacementof any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization orfarm) as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition fora program assisted under this part. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A displacement from the real property is covered by the URA if itoccurs on or after the date that an application is submitted under Part280 and the application is later approved and funded, unless: (i) The personhas been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation ofthe material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement and HUD determinesthat the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligationto provide relocation assistance; (ii) The person moved into the real propertyafter the application was submitted, but received prior written noticeof the expected displacement; (iii) The person is an owner-occupant andhas been informed that the real property will not be acquired for the programunder the threat of eminent domain; or (iv) The applicant (recipient) determinesthat the displacement did not occur as a direct result of the acquisition,rehabilitation, or demolition for the program, and HUD concurs in thatdetermination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_If a person is displaced from the real property before the submissionof the application and either HUD or the applicant (recipient) determinesthat the displacement was a direct result of the acquisition, rehabilitation,or demolition, the person shall be eligible for relocation assistance asa displaced person. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The applicant (recipient) may, at any time, request a HUD determinationwhether a displacement will be covered by the URA and the implementingregulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A displaced persons' eligibility for relocation assistance is subjectto the requirements in 49 CFR Part 24.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Conflicts of interest. </T3>A nonprofit organization argued that theconflict of interest provisions contained in the proposed rule could beinterpreted to in a manner that would limit their participation in NHOP.The commenter argued that it is counterproductive to impose broad conflictof interest provisions on all entities where the real and legitimate purposeof the provision is to prevent the manipulation of nonprofit organizationsthat are formed primarily to benefit for-profit companies or individuals.The proposed conflict of interest provisions were based on similar requirementsimposed in other programs using private nonprofit organizations as recipients(see e.g., andSection;andSection;840.330(e) and 841.330(e)). HUD is not awarethat these provisions have resulted in unwarranted restrictions on participationin such programs by nonprofit organizations. The proposed conflict of interestprovisions are adopted without change. (c) <T3>Drug-Free Workplace. </T3>The Drug-Free Work Workplace Act of 1988(Pub. L. 100-690) which became effective on March 18, 1989 applies to NHOP.This Act requires applicants to make a certification as a condition toan award of a grant, that they will provide a drug-free workplace. Accordingly,andSection;andSection;280.207 Other Federal Requirements and 280.205 ApplicationRequirements have been revised to refer to the certification. 3. <T3>Selection process. </T3>HUD proposed to use a three-step competitiveprocess in the selection of recipients. The steps included threshold review,ranking, and final selection. Comments on this process are discussed below.(a) Threshold review (andSection;280.215). In the threshold stage, HUD wouldreview all applications under stated criteria. The following thresholdcriteria were addressed by commenters:<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Market demand. </T3>One threshold criterion requires the applicantto demonstrate that there is a demand among eligible purchasers for homesin the area to be served, and that this demand is sufficient to ensurethe sale of all homes under the proposed program. A commenter thought thatthis requirement was excessive. Instead, the commenter suggested that HUDrequire applicants to demonstrate a need sufficient to justify a programof a certain size, and evidence to demonstrate that demand is sufficientto ensure that 25 percent of the homes will be sold immediately to eligiblebuyers.The final rule clarifies that the recipient is not required to demonstratethat there is an existing demand that will ensure the immediate sale ofeach home. Rather, the applicant will be required to demonstrate that thereis or will be sufficient demand among eligible purchasers for homes inthe area to be served, and that this demand is sufficient to ensure thesale of all homes consistent with the program schedule submitted underandSection;208.205(b)(5).<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Local consultation. </T3>The applicant must demonstrate that it hasconsulted with, and has received the support of, residents of the neighborhoodin which the program is located. At a minimum, the applicant must demonstratethat it provided a description of the program to the residents and requestedtheir comments. The method used by the applicant to furnish the informationmust be designed to ensure that all residents receive actual or constructivenotice of the program description and the request for comments. In responseto a commenter, the final rule states that publication at least once aweek for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation servingthe neighborhoods in which the program is located will constitute constructivenotice. <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Zoning</T3>. The proposed rule required the applicant to demonstratethat the use of the proposed site is permissible under applicable zoningand other regulations, or that there is a reasonable basis to believe thatproposed zoning actions will be completed successfully within four monthsof the submission of the application. A commenter observed that it willbe extremely difficult to complete all zoning actions successfully withinthe proposed time period in some areas.The zoning requirement is necessary to ensure that the applicant will makesatisfactory progress toward the start of new construction or substantialrehabilitation following selection. The requirement should be easy to satisfyif the applicant has site control (andSection; 280.215(b)(7)(i)), has consultedwith and received the support of residents of the neighborhood in whichthe program is to be located (andSection; 280.215(b)(5)(i)), and has theapproval of each unit of general local government in which the programis to be located (andSection; 280.215(b)(5)(ii)). In recognition that zoningactions may take additional time in some areas even with official support,the final rule has been revised to require applicants to show that allzoning actions will be completed within six months of the submission ofthe application.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Environmental impact</T3>. The final rule states that HUD will assessthe environmental effects of each proposal under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFRPart 50. Any application that requires an Environmental Impact Statement(EIS) (generally those applications that HUD determines would have an unavoidablesignificant impact on the environment in accordance with the environmentalassessment procedures at 24 CFR Part 50, Subpart E) will not be eligiblefor ranking. The final rule has moved the references to the Coastal BarriersAct to the section governing ``Other Federal requirements'' (andSection;280.207) and has added clarifying language that significant impacts generallymust be ``unavoidable'' to require an EIS.One commenter argued that the exclusion of proposals requiring an environmentalimpact statement is unnecessarily restrictive. HUD notes that many factorswarrant an active concern for the environmental quality of proposals. HUDbelieves that it is appropriate to reject proposals that will cause environmentalimpacts, or will be affected by existing adverse conditions that wouldremain as a detriment and hazard to neighborhood residents and purchasingfamilies and that would not be resolved by proposed means of improvement.Another commenter argued that NHOP is categorically exempt from environmentalrequirements because it involves the development of one- to four-familybuildings. The categorical exemption for one- to four-family buildingsis found at 24 CFR 50.20(a) and provides that NEPA does not apply to ``anindividual action on a one- to four-family dwelling or an individual actionon a project of five- or more units developed on scattered sites * * *and there are not more than four units on any one site''. Programs willgenerally range in size from 50 to 250 homes. While such programs willinvolve the development of one- to four-family buildings, an applicationfor such a program does not constitute ``an <T3>individual</T3> action on a one- to four-family dwelling''. The categoricalexemption is not applicable.Various commenters addressed historic preservation requirements. The AdvisoryCouncil on Historic Preservation (ACHP) asked how HUD will fulfill itsresponsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16U.S.C. 470-470w6) (NHPA). The final rule states that HUD will assess theenvironmental impacts of each proposal in accordance with NEPA and HUD'simplementing regulations at 24 CFR Part 50. Part 50 covers NEPA and a numberof other environmental authorities. These authorities, cited at 24 CFR50.4, include NHPA, procedures for the Protection of Historic and CulturalProperties (36 CFR Part 800) and other historic preservation authorities.ACHP was also concerned that the proposed rule would discourage creativeuse of historic properties. ACHP asserted that the provision disqualifyingproposals that require the preparation an EIS has been used in other HUDprograms to deny applications involving the rehabilitation of historicproperties. ACHP asserts that HUD has determined that such rehabilitationwould constitute a ``significant impact'' on these buildings. The commentersuggested that HUD and ACHP negotiate an agreement addressing HUD's administrationof NHOP with regard to historic properties.The cited provision does not preclude or discourage the use of historicproperties. Section 110(i) of NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470h-2(i)) makes it clearthat nothing in NHPA shall be construed to require the preparation of anEIS where such a statement would not otherwise be required under NEPA.Thus, the exclusion of proposals that require the preparation of an EIS<T3>does not</T3>, by itself, preclude the use of historic properties.HUD will encourage the use of historic properties where feasible.Another commenter urged HUD to exempt programs from all historic preservationrequirements. The commenter argued that this change would relieve recipientsof the responsibility of meeting extraordinary historical standards thatincrease program costs and cause delay.Historic preservation requirements are imposed on actions that involve``undertakings''. Programs assisted under NHOP will constitute undertakingswhen they result in changes in the character or use of historic propertiesor if any such historic properties are located in the area of potentialeffects. (See 36 CFR Part 800.) HUD cannot exempt NHOP from the applicationof these requirements. As to delays caused by compliance, these are a functionof the law and of the applicable historic preservation regulations. Asto increased program costs, the use of historic properties does not alwaysrequire full historic restoration, but usually involves meeting preservationstandards that are technically sound and financially reasonable based onthe property and the program resources available. Experience has demonstratedthat the mitigation of adverse effects on historic property is almost alwaysnegotiated in the process. While treatment costs on historic propertiesmay be higher than the cost of rehabilitating non-historic property, theyare usually reasonable. Only rarely is the use of historic property foreclosedon an economic basis.Finally, one commenter argued that HUD should exempt programs from alllocal environmental procedures. HUD does not believe that it is appropriateto preempt State and local laws with regard to environmental matters bythis regulation.(b) <T3>Ranking. </T3>In the second stage, HUD evaluates those applicationssuccessfully completing threshold review and places these applicationsin a rank order based on six criteria set forth in section 607 of the Act.One commenter complained that the regulation does not describe how theranking criteria are to be weighted and scored. The commenter argued thatsuch information is necessary to enable potential recipients to developapplications that are responsive to HUD's concerns and NHOP goals. HUDwill periodically publish a notice announcing the availability of fundsfor NHOP. The notice will specify the maximum number of points that maybe awarded under each of the ranking criteria and provide other appropriateprogram information and guidance (see andSection; 280.200). To ensure thateach statutorily-imposed ranking criterion will receive adequate consideration,the final rule provides that the maximum number of points that may be awardedunder each ranking criterion will be not less than 10 percent of the maximumnumber of points that may be awarded under all of the ranking criteria.Under proposed andSection; 280.220(b)(2), HUD considered the extent to whichnon-Federal public or private financial and other contributions to theprogram will reduce the cost to families purchasing homes constructed orsubstantially rehabilitated under the program. Upon reconsideration, thefinal rule has been revised to provide that programs that receive suchcontributions under a State-designated enterprise zone program will receiveadditional points under this criterion. (A State-designated enterprisezone means an area that is designated in accordance with a State law, Stateexecutive order, or State plan that recognizes distressed areas and encouragesor offers incentives for private investment that will create jobs and assistin the economic revitalization of the area.) This revision will give State-designatedenterprise zones the recognition and support that they deserve. Enterprisezones encourage entrepreneurship and job creation in distressed inner cityand rural areas, a major goal of any economic development effort such asNHOP. The number of additional points that will be awarded to programsmeeting these State-designated enterprise zone requirements will also beannounced in the NHOP NOFA.The commenters addressed the following ranking criteria:<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Contributions of land</T3>. HUD is required to consider the extentto which non-Federal public or private entities will contribute land necessaryto make the program feasible. Land necessary to the feasibility of theprogram would include individual lots for homes constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated under the program. In response to one commenter's request,this requirement has been clarified to permit the consideration of landcontributed for use in the program prior to the submission of the application.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Cost effectiveness</T3>. HUD is required to consider the degree towhich the program will produce the maximum number of homes for the leastamount of NHOP assistance, taking into consideration cost differences amongdifferent market areas. Cost adjustments are made by the application ofa commercial construction cost index selected by HUD and announced in theNOFA. A commenter emphasized that the selected index must reflect the costsof construction in such high cost cities as New York. HUD intends to usethe appropriate quarterly local cost multipliers listed in the ResidentialCost Handbook published by Marshall and Swift Publication Company to adjustbetween market areas. HUD believes that these multipliers will provideappropriate adjustments.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Neighborhood blight</T3>. One commenter suggested that HUD considerthe degree to which the median income of the neighborhood in which theprogram is located is lower than median incomes of the neighborhoods involvedin competing applications. This information is considered when HUD determinesthe extent to which each program is located in a neighborhood of severephysical and economic blight (andSection; 280.220(b)(4)(i)).<T3>E. Program Operation</T3>1. <T3>Eligible purchasers</T3>. The statute provides that families purchasinga home must have a family income on the date of purchase that does notexceed the higher of ``the median income for a family of 4 persons in themetropolitan statistical area involved'' (subject to a limited exception,discussed below) or ``the national median income for a family of 4 persons.''The preamble to the proposed rule observed that this statutory languagewas troublesome because data on median income for a family of four arenot available. HUD noted that the decennial Census provides only medianincome data and does not provide median income data based on family size.HUD is required to develop lower income limits that are based on 80 percentof the median family income for an area of programs under the United StatesHousing Act of 1937. These median income limits are then adjusted for smallerand larger families. Currently for most areas, the lower income limit fora family of four under the programs is set at 80 percent of the medianfamily income. (<T3>I.e.</T3>, under these programs, the median family income adjustedfor a family of four is assumed to be equal to median family income.) Inlight of the lack of data for median income for a family of four, the proposedrule made a similar assumption and used median family income as the eligibilitystandard.One commenter observed that Census data on national median family incomeby family size are available in <T3>Detailed Population Characteristic, PC 80-1-01A (Table 299)</T3>, andthat annual updates to median family income by family size is availablein <T3>Current Population Survey, P-60 Series, Money Income and Poverty Statusin the United States (Table 1)</T3>. The commenter urged HUD to revisethe proposed rule to reflect the availability of this data.HUD's statement that data on the national median income for a family offour persons is not available was incorrect. Nonetheless, HUD believesthat the data cited by the commenter have numerous disadvantages that makestheir use for NHOP infeasible. These disadvantages include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The data are not current. As of March 1989 the most recent P-60 estimatesmeasure median income for mid-1987. By contrast, the median family incomeestimates developed for the Section 8 program by HUD have been calculatedforward to the start of the second quarter of calendar year 1989. Thisrepresents a 20-month difference between the availability of the citeddata estimates and the mid-point of the projected HUD median family incomeestimates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The data only reflect median income estimates for a family of fourfor the nation and for Census regions. Median family income for a familyof four for subregional areas is not available. While formulae can be developedto compute this figure for MSAs, such a breakdown would conceal large variationsin median income among the MSAs. For example, the P-60 data may show noincome increase for a Census region. This data, however, would not reveala median income increase in one MSA that was counterbalanced by an incomedecrease in another MSA. While HUD could use the P-60 data for nationalincome limit and the Section 8 income data for the local limit, such estimatesare statistically inconsistent since they would be based on different databases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_It is highly likely that Congress intended the HUD median familyincome estimate developed under the Section 8 program to be used. Thismedian income estimate is commonly used by HUD and many other Federal agencies(e.g., the Department of the Treasury and Farmer's Home Administration)in the administration of various programs. Moreover, there is a commonmisconception that the four-person income limit under the Section 8 programis derived from a four-person median income estimate. It is not. HUD doesnot prepare any estimates of the median family income for various familysizes. Rather, the four-person income limit is derived from the medianincome estimate for all families.</ITAG>The commenter also noted that the 1987 <T3>Current Population Survey</T3> uses 3.17 persons as the median familysize and, thus, the median family income in a particular MSA is more comparableto the median family income of a family of <T3>3</T3> persons in the MSA rather than <T3>4</T3>. The commenter argued that HUD's determination of MSA medianfamily income for a family of four should reflect this data. The commenter'sinformation on family size is accurate. However as noted above, there simplyis no available data source that provides a factor to make this correction.Moreover, the limited information available seems to indicate that thereis no direct correlation between family size and income. <T3>E.q.</T3>, in some areas, the median family income for families offour will exceed the median income for families of three and in other areasthe opposite is true.Based on the above, HUD will use the most recent median family income datadeveloped by HUD for the Section 8 program.The final rule has been clarified in response to commenters who believedthat HUD intended to rely on 1980 Census data without an annual update.As revised, the final rule states that for the purpose of determining themedian family income for the nation and metropolitan statistical areas,the recipient must use the most recent median family incomes developedby HUD under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.2. <T3>Sales contract</T3>. Under proposed andSection; 280.320, the recipientand each family purchasing a home under NHOP are required to execute asales contract containing appropriate terms and conditions covering thepurchase of the home, the downpayment requirements and repayment provisionsdescribed below, and such other terms and conditions as HUD may require.A commenter suggested that the provision requiring sales contracts to containsuch other terms and conditions should be revised. The commenter wouldmake the loan subject to such other terms and conditions as are establishedby HUD before the deadline for NHOP applications. The commenter noted thatif additional terms and conditions are imposed, recipients would be unfairlyrequired to revise plans for implementing programs. The same comment wasraised regarding similar requirements governing the loan agreement underandSection; 280.322(a)(7).The final rule retains the contested provisions. The additional terms andconditions that will be required in the agreements will be limited to thosenecessary to complete the sale or loan (<T3>e.g.</T3>, provisions governing settlement procedures) and will bespecifically tailored to cover the applicable State and local laws. HUDwill not require terms and conditions in the sales contract or in the loanagreement that will be contrary to the requirements of the statute or theseregulations. The additional terms and conditions should not have a substantialimpact on the recipient and the terms and conditions should not requirerecipients to revise their plans for implementing programs.3. <T3>Downpayment requirement</T3>._(a) <T3>Amount</T3>. Proposed andSection; 280.320(b) required each family purchasinga home to make a downpayment of 10 percent of the sales price of the home.A higher downpayment may be required if the recipient determines that sucha downpayment is appropriate (andSection; 280.320(b)(1)(i)). A lower downpaymentmay be required under the circumstances described below (andSection; 280.320(b)(1)(ii)).HUD recognizes that most eligible purchasers have few resources for downpaymentsand have a limited ability to amass significant sums quickly. The amountof the downpayment, however, is set by the terms of the statute. To theextent consistent with the statute, HUD has tried to lessen the financialimpact of this 10 percent requirement. For example, the final rule hasbeen clarified to state that all of the purchaser's cash contributions(<T3>e.g.</T3> closing costs) are included in the computation of the purchaser's10 percent downpayment. Section 280.320(b)(1) states that the recipient may require a downpaymentof less than 10 percent, if the first mortgage on the home is to be heldby a State or a unit of general local government under a home loan programprovided by the State or unit of general local government, and the programprovides for a lower downpayment. One commenter requested that HUD specificallyprovide that mortgage revenue bond programs qualify for exception underthis provision. Mortgages issued in connection with a mortgage revenue bond program, inmost instances, will qualify for exception under this provision becausethe State or unit of general local government will hold the first mortgage.In some programs, however, the State or unit of general local governmentwill enter into agreements with mortgage lenders where the lender issuesthe first mortgage. The proceeds of the mortgage revenue bonds are usedto purchase these mortgages on the secondary market. In such cases, theholder of the first mortage is the commercial lender, not the State orunit of general local government. Such programs would not qualify for theexception. The proposed clarification has not been made. (b) <T3>Source of downpayment. </T3>The proposed rule provides that the familymust provide a downpayment and that government entities and instrumentalitiesare prohibited from providing the funds for the downpayment. A commenteropposed this prohibition. The commenter noted that the prohibition is notrequired by statute and alleged that the proposed rule would prohibit theuse of many State and local government downpayment assistance programs.Congress recognized that downpayment requirements provide a valuable incentiveto save for families wishing to purchase a home, and ensure that purchasershave some equity, and thus a greater stake in the home's upkeep. (See H.Rep. No. 100-122, 100th Cong. 1st Sess, 97 (1987).) Accordingly, section605(c) of the Act required that the <T3>family </T3>purchasing a home under NHOP must make the required downpayment.To ensure that families will have a financial stake in the home, the finalrule continues to forbid government entities and other instrumentalitiesfrom providing the funds for the family's downpayment. Moreover, the impositionof this prohibition is supported by section 605(c)(1)(B). This sectionrecognizes only one exception to the requirement that the family must provideat least a 10 percent downpayment. This exception is specifically limitedto situations where the first mortgage on the home is to be held by a Stateor unit or general local government under a home loan program providedby the State or unit of general local government and the program providesfor lower downpayment. Another commenter argued that the proposed rule should permit States andlocal governments to provide funds (by local or other forms of assistance)to eligible purchasers if the funds are not used for the downpayment. Forexample, State and local governments may provide additional assistancein the form of a reduction of the total purchase price of the home or thepayment of settlement costs. Financial and other contributions. (contributionsthat result in the program cost reductions that are reflected in the salesprice of homes or that result in the reduction of carrying charges to familiespurchasing homes under the program) <T3>are </T3>permitted under the program and are discussed at andSection;280.220(b)(2). This section expressly provides that financial and othercontributions to the program that will reduce the cost of families purchasinghomes under NHOP will be considered as a ranking factor. HUD does not believethat further specificity is required. (c) <T3>Date of downpayment.</T3> Comments noted that standard real estatepractice does not require borrowers to provide a 10 percent downpaymentat the time of the execution of the sales contract. Rather, earnest moneydeposits are made in conjunction with the execution of a sales contract.A commenter argued that it would be highly irresponsible for HUD to requirethe full downpayment when the sales contract is executed, particularlywhere homes may not be under construction when the sales contract is executed.The statute does not specify a date by which the family must provide adownpayment. HUD anticipates that recipients may wish to require paymentof the downpayment at different times, or may wish to permit families toaccumulate their downpayments over a period of time before settlement.To provide the recipient with the greatest amount of discretion with regardto the date of the required downpayment, proposed andSection; 280.320(b)(2)provided that the family must make the downpayment on the date requiredby the recipient. This provision is retained in the final rule. This requirementis subject to the minimum participation provision which states that constructionor substantial rehabilitation of non-display homes may not begin until25 percent of the homes under the program have been contracted for saleand the required downpayments are made. One commenter suggested that HUD permit lease-purchase arrangements. Suchlease-purchases would require the commitment of a small sum (1 to 2 percentof the purchase price) and would have a built-in savings program (monthlycommitment of funds to a downpayment escrow concurrent with rent payment).HUD does not believe that lease-purchase agreements are contemplated bythe statute. The statute generally refers to contracts for sale, and containsprohibitions against leasing (e.g., section 605(d) states that no familypurchasing a home under NHOP may lease the home.) Moreover, the purposeof NHOP is to encourage homeownership by families and to rebuild the depressedareas of the cities. HUD believes that the leasepurchase contracts envisionedby the commenter would substantially reduce the stake that the family wouldhave in the home and the commitment of the purchasers to the upkeep ofthe home, and would tend to turn NHOP homes into rental properties contraryto the goals of the legislation. (d) <T3>Interest on downpayment. </T3>Under proposed andSection; 280.320(b)(3),the recipient is required to deposit all downpayments in an account witha federally-insured bank or savings and loan institution. In response toa commenter's suggestion, the final rule includes federally insured creditunions as eligible depositories. The recipient is required to pay interest on the downpayment to the familyfrom the date that the downpayment is made through the date of settlementat the actual rate of interest earned on the account. Under the proposedrule, the interest rate paid to the family may not be lower that the lowestrate of interest paid on time savings deposits with a federally insuredbank or savings and loan institution conducting business within the MSAin which the program is located. (The final rule has been changed to referto the lowest rate of interest paid by such institutions within the State).A commenter urged HUD to provide a definition of time savings deposit.The commenter noted that deposits into time certificates could limit theavailability of funds when needed for closing. Consistent with the statutorylanguage, the final rule has been revised to provide that the interestrate shall not be lower than the ``passbook rate''. 4. <T3>Loan requirements. </T3>Section 280.322(a) contains the HUD-imposedrequirements for each NHOP loan. A commenter argued that the rule mustinclude the formula that HUD will use to compute the amount of the loan.This commenter believed that the amount of the loan would be based uponfamily size and family income. Under andSection; 280.322(a)(2), the amountof the NHOP loan is limited to $15,000. HUD has not imposed any furtherregulatory limitations on the loan amount. HUD notes, however, that recipientsmay place their own restrictions on the size of NHOP loan. Indeed, HUD'sranking of eligible applicants will be based, in part, upon the degreeto which each program will produce the maximum number of homes for theleast amount of assistance under NHOP, taking into consideration cost differencesamong the market areas. 5. <T3>HUD payments to recipient. </T3>Proposed andSection; 280.322(b) statedthat HUD will provide the recipient with an amount equal to the amountof the loan within 30 days after the date of purchase of a home with aloan under this part. The date of purchase was defined as the date thata family executes a sales contract for the purchase of a home under NHOP.A commenter noted that the traditional definition of the purchase dateis the date of settlement. This commenter asked whether this provisionwould permit HUD to provide funding before the actual closing of the homebased on the execution of a sales contract. If so, the commenter askedwhether HUD funds could be used to support actual construction. NHOP fundswill be available to the recipient within 30 days of the date that thefamily executes a sales contract for the purchase of a home. The use ofthese funds, however, is limited to the provision of a loan to the purchasingfamily. The funding may not be used for other purposes and may not be usedto support actual construction or substantial rehabilitation. Another commenter noted that funds must be available before a loan canbe closed. The commenter argued that this rule must clearly state thatHUD will make an amount equal to the loan available for the closing andthat in every case the money should be made available no later than 30days after the closing. As noted above, reimbursement will be made within30 days of the date that the contract of sale is executed. This shouldbe sufficient to ensure that the recipient will have access to funds beforeclosing. One commenter addressed HUD's method of reimbursement to recipients. Thecommenter recommended that HUD provide for payment by letter of credit.Under such a system, HUD would commit the entire amount of the NHOP grantto an approved recipient through a letter of credit upon initiation ofpresales. The commenter argued that this revision would simplify the processof drawing down funds and expedite completion of settlements. HUD intends to reimburse recipients under NHOP through direct deposit.Payments will be made following the presentation of a request for advanceor reimbursement. Payments will be made through the Department of the Treasury'sAutomated Clearing House which will automatically deposit approved fundsinto the recipient's bank account. HUD does not believe that the letterof credit method proposed by the commenter is a preferable method of paymentsince both methods require recipients to provide an accounting for eachhome sale and because payments under either system would be equally expeditious.(Generally reimbursement will occur within 48 hours of the recipient'ssubmission of information regarding the purchase.) 6. <T3>Repayment of loan. </T3>As required by sections 604(b)(4) and 606(e)(5)of the Act, proposed andSection; 280.330(a) provided that the family mustrepay the NHOP loan to HUD if the family sells, leases, or transfers anyinterest in the property. The Senate Committee Report stated that the refinancingof the first mortgage would not require repayment, unless there is a relatedsale, lease or other transfer of the property. See S. Rep. No. 100-121,100 Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1987). Based on this report, the proposed rulestated that refinancing that is unrelated to a sale, equity withdrawal,lease, or transfer of interest in the property would not require repayment.Refinancing involving an equity withdrawal would require repayment of theloan to HUD to the extent of the withdrawal. Section 606(e)(5) of the Act provides that the Secretary may approve atransfer of the home without repayment. Based upon the House CommitteeReport which indicated that the Committee anticipated that the Secretarywould issue such approval only if the proceeds of the sale are insufficientto repay the second mortgage in full (H.R. Rep. No. 100-122, 100 Cong.,1st Sess. 96 (1987), the proposed rule stated that approval would be grantedonly if HUD determined that an undue hardship would result from the applicationof the repayment requirement, and that HUD will make this finding onlyif the proceeds of the transaction are insufficient to repay the loan amountin full. This provision further provided that approval would be grantedonly to the extent that the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to repaythe loan in full and that HUD will not approve a lease without repayment.Several commenters objected that the proposed rule was too restrictive.(E.g., one commenter noted that the congressional intent with regard tothe forgiveness of the repayment obligation was not memorialized in thestatutory language and that broader provisions for transfer and HUD approvalof transfers may be included in the final rule.) Commenters proposed revisionsthat would permit transfers without repayment or would permit HUD to approvetransfers without repayment under various circumstances. For example, commenterswould permit: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Equity withdrawal without repayment if the property value is sufficientto cover the first and second mortgages; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Sale without repayment where an income-eligible first-time homebuyerpurchases the home; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Transfer without repayment where the resale price of the homes inthe area are ``restricted''; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Transfer without repayment where the family has held the propertyfor a set number of years (or has transferred the home to another incomeeligible family for this set number of years); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The establishment of a formula that would allow the family, if thehome is well maintained, to receive a portion of whatever is realized ina sale over and above the first mortgage. Purportedly, this would ensurethat each family would receive some monetary return for their commitmentto a high-risk neighborhood and the maintenance of their house.</ITAG>The proposed changes would permit the family purchasing a home to reapa benefit under NHOP that was not intended by Congress. One of the mainpurposes of NHOP is to encourage homeownership by families in the UnitedStates who are otherwise not able to afford homeownership. Many of theproposed changes would benefit first-time <T3>sellers </T3>rather than first-time <T3>purchasers. </T3>For example, permitting transfers without repaymentto income-eligible first-time buyers would not assist that second buyerin the purchase of the home. Rather, the benefits from such a transferwould inure entirely to the seller since the purchase price of the homewould, if economic forces of the market prevail, include an incrementalpayment for the non-interest bearing loan. Congress did not choose to attach the beneficial loan provisions of NHOPto specific properties in perpetuity. Rather, it permitted the family purchasingthe home to receive the benefits of the interest-free second mortgage onlyduring the time that the family owns the property. Upon the sale, leaseor transfer, NHOP requires repayment into a revolving fund that will beused to develop further NHOP properties. In light of this statutory framework,the proposed changes discussed above have not been made. Upon consideration, HUD believes that the provisions permitting HUD toapprove a sale or other transfer on a case-by-case basis may be too restrictive.While the Senate report anticipated that HUD would grant approval onlywhere the funds were insufficient to repay the second mortgage in full,the report did not limit HUD's approval to such situations. HUD believesthat there may be circumstances where such approval should be granted.For example, if there is an equity withdrawal related to a refinancingof a home, the current rule would require a family to repay the secondmortgage up to the extent of the equity withdrawal. Repayment would berequired even if the family intended to use the equity withdrawal to maintainor preserve the mortgaged premises (roof repair, replacement of major appliances,etc.). The final rule provides HUD with greater discretion in the approvalof such transfers.7. <T3>Funding amendments and deobligation of funds. </T3>Proposed andSection;280.335(b)(1)(ii) stated that HUD may deobligate amounts if the recipientfails to carry out activities under the program within a reasonable timeafter selection. One commenter asked what will constitute a reasonabletime and suggested that a minimum of two years should be allotted to thegrant recipient to carry out the program. The amount of time that will be reasonable for the completion of variousNHOP activities will vary from program to program and may be affected bysuch factors as: the recipient's planned production schedule, the sizeof the program, consumer acceptance of the homes, seasonal limitationson construction and rehabilitation activities, unforeseeable contingencies(such as litigation), etc. Accordingly, HUD will review each program ona case-by-case basis. HUD will base its determination of reasonablenesson the recipient's program schedule (see andSection; 280.205(b)(5)) and onthe circumstances affecting each program. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters </ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development,Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(d) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. An analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability to United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the numberof recipients that will be funded under the program will be small and willinclude both small and large recipients, HUD does not believe that a significantnumber of small entities will be affected by this program. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No.12606_The Family, has determined that the rule will not have a significantimpact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The program isa benefit to families because it encourages homeownership in the UnitedStates by eligible families who are not otherwise able to afford homeownership.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder No. 12611_Federalism, has determined that the final rule does notinvolve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation anddoes not have federalism implications. Rather, the rule requires approvalby State and local governments of proposed programs and defers to Stateand local policies in many areas including: local building codes; the amountof the required downpayment where the first mortgage is held by local governmentsunder a home loan program conducted by the State or local government; andlocal government approval of the program schedule.

(ii) The environmental review may reveal information not contained in theapplication that may have relevance to the selection process. HUD willconsider such relevant information under the appropriate threshold andranking criteria. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 280.220 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Ranking criteria. </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general.</T3> Applications that fulfill each of the threshold requirementsof andSection; 280.215 will be assigned a rating score and will be placedin ranked order, based upon the criteria described in paragraph (b) ofthis section. The number of points that will be awarded under each rankingcriterion will be announced in the Notice Of Fund Availability under andSection;280.200. The maximum number of points possible under each ranking criterionwill be not less than 10 percent of the maximum number of total pointspossible under all of the ranking criteria. (b) <T3>Criteria.</T3> The ranking criteria are: (1) <T3>Contributions of land.</T3> (i) HUD will consider the extent to whichnon-Federal public and private entities have contributed or will contributeland necessary to make the program feasible. To be considered under thiscriterion, the contribution of land must meet the definition of financialand other contributions to the program as described in andSection; 280.5.(ii) For the purposes of this criterion, land is necessary to the feasibilityof the program if the land is used to provide individual lots for homesconstructed or substantially rehabilitated under the program. Other contributionsof land, such as land that will be used for parks, green spaces, or lotsto support community facilities, are not necessary to the feasibility ofthe program and will not be considered under this criterion. Such contributions,however, may be considered if the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of thissection are met. (iii) HUD will award the maximum number of points to applications thatinvolve programs for which all land necessary to the feasibility of theprogram will be contributed from such sources. (2) <T3>Other contributions.</T3> (i) HUD will consider the extent to whichnon-Federal public or private financial and other contributions to theprogram will reduce the cost to families purchasing homes constructed orsubstantially rehabilitated under the program. Programs that receive suchcontributions under a State-designated enterprise zone program will receiveadditional points under this criterion. For the purpose of this criterion,a State-designated enterprise zone means an area that is designated inaccordance with a State law, State executive order, or State plan thatrecognizes distressed areas and encourages or offers incentives for privateinvestment that will create jobs and assist in the economic revitalizationof the area. (ii) Donations of land will not be considered under this criterion to theextent that such donations are considered under paragraph (b)(1) of thissection. (iii) HUD will assign the maximum number of points under this criterionto applications: that involve financial and other contributions to theprogram that will result in the greatest reduction in purchase price andcarrying charges to families purchasing homes constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated under the program; and that will receive such contributionsunder a State-designated enterprise zone program. (3) <T3>Cost effectiveness.</T3> HUD will consider the degree to which eachprogram will produce the maximum number of homes for the least amount ofassistance under this part, taking into consideration cost differencesamong different market areas. For each application, HUD will: (i) adjustthe amount of requested assistance to eliminate cost differences betweenmarket areas by applying a commercial construction cost index selectedby HUD and announced in the Notice Of Fund Availability under andSection;280.200; and (ii) divide the adjusted assistance by the number of homesto be constructed or substantially rehabilitated under the program. Applicationsthat have the smallest adjusted assistance average will receive the maximumnumber of points under this criterion. (4) <T3>Neighborhood blight. </T3>(i) HUD will consider the degree of the physicaland economic blight in the neighborhoods in which the program is located.In determining the degree of physical blight, HUD will consider the condition(but not the age) of existing housing, other buildings, and the infrastructurein the neighborhoods. In assessing the degree of economic blight, HUD willconsider such factors as the unemployment rate, median family income andcrime rate in the neighborhoods. HUD will assign the maximum number ofpoints under this factor to applications that demonstrate the greatestdegree of physical and economic blight.     (ii) HUD will also consider the impact that the proposed program, by itselfor together with improvement efforts that are or will be undertaken inthe neighborhoods by units of general local government or private entities,will have upon the quality and viability of the neighborhoods. Other improvementefforts may include the construction or rehabilitation of other structures,improvements to public facilities or services, or the expansion of privateenterprise in the neighborhoods. HUD will assign the maximum number ofpoints under this factor to applications that demonstrate that the program,by itself or together with other improvement efforts, will result in asubstantial improvement in the overall quality and long-term viabilityof the neighborhood.     (5) <T3>Construction cost. </T3>HUD will consider the degree to which the applicantwill use construction or rehabilitation methods that will reduce the costper square foot for the proposed program below the average constructioncost per square foot in the market area involved. HUD will determine: (i)the average construction cost per square foot in the market area of theproposed program by referring to a commercially available publication issuingconstruction cost data for the market area (the construction cost publicationwill be selected by HUD and announced in the notice of fund availabilityunder andSection;280.200); and (ii) the average construction or rehabilitationcost per square foot of the program (as adjusted for cost reductions thatare attributable solely to financial and other contributions to the program).HUD will award the maximum number of points under this criterion to theapplications in which the average adjusted cost per square foot for theprogram is the smallest percentage of the average construction cost persquare foot in the market area.     (6) <T3>Local resident involvement. </T3>HUD will consider the degree to whichthe program provides for the involvement of local residents of the neighborhoodin the planning and construction or substantial rehabilitation of homes.Under this criterion, HUD will consider: (i) the extent to which residentsof the neighborhood will be employed in the construction and substantialrehabilitation of homes in the program; (ii) the extent to which localresidents, individually or through membership in local organizations, haveadvised or assisted the applicant in the development of the proposed program,or have participated on committees or governing boards of the applicantinvolved in the development of the proposed program; and (iii) the likelihoodof continued participation by local residents in program activities followingselection. The maximum number of points under this criterion will be awardedto applicants that demonstrate: a commitment to employ a significant numberof local residents in the construction or substantial rehabilitation ofhomes in the program; a significant past commitment by local residentsto the development of the program; and a strong likelihood that this levelof commitment to the program will continue through program completion.    (c) <T3>Exception. </T3>If State or local governmental entities are prohibitedby State law from making a financial or other contribution to a programand the contribution would be eligible for consideration under the criteriondescribed at paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section, HUD will not penalizean applicant under the ranking process for the lack of such a contributionto the program.     <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;280.225     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Final selection.     </ITAG>In the final stage of the selection process, the highest-ranked applicationswill be considered for final selection in accordance with their rank order,as determined under andSection;280.220. If the highest-ranked applicationsinvolve programs that predominantly serve one geographic area, HUD maysubstitute one or more other highly-ranked applications to ensure reasonablegeographic variety in the program. Upon completion of final selection,HUD will notify each successful applicant of its selection. HUD will alsonotify each unsuccessful applicant that it has not been selected, and willprovide the unsuccessful applicant with an explanation for the denial ofthe application.     <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Program Operation     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;280.300     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Obligation of funds.     </ITAG>When HUD selects an application for funding, it will obligate sufficientamounts for a grant to cover the aggregate amount of the loans proposedunder the selected program.     <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;280.303     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Grant agreement.     </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The recipient's responsibilities under NHOP will be incorporatedin a grant agreement excecuted by HUD and the recipient.
