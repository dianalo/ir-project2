The company named executive vice president William N. Sick, who has been president of its semiconductor group since 1981, to a new post in which he will be responsible for creating alliances and cooperative agreements with other semiconductor companies and beefing up Texas Instruments' presence in the Asia-Pacific region.    &quot;I was doing those things before, but we felt we needed to create a position where I can spend full time accelerating the creation of these (cooperative) arrangements,&quot; Mr. Sick, 52 years old, said. &quot;With the rapid changes taking place in the electronics industry, it's extremely important.&quot;    The move follows closely agreements by other U.S. chip makers to form joint ventures with Japanese electronics companies. Last week, Motorola Inc. agreed to form a joint venture with Toshiba Corp. to make semiconductors and license certain chip technology. And in October, Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. announced plans to merge its semiconductor business with Schlumberger Ltd.'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. unit.    &quot;The Japanese have basically said you have to have joint ventures if you want to participate in our markets,&quot; said Daniel Klesken, a technology analyst with Montgomery Securities. &quot;TI seems to realize if they don't do something quick, they're going to be left behind.&quot;    Mr. Sick, who assumes his new post Jan. 1, said Texas Instruments currently is discussing alliances &quot;involving anything from joint sourcing of products to cooperative development of product lines.&quot; He declined to be more specific, but stressed that Texas Instruments wasn't concentrating on alliances with Japanese electronics concerns, but also would explore cooperative agreements with other domestic and European companies.    Analysts said, however, that they believe the move clearly signals that a Texas Instruments joint venture with a Japanese concern is likely within six months.    Adam Cuhney, a technology analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. said he sees Japan's Sharp Electronics Corp. or Oki Semiconductor Corp. as logical candidates for a Texas Instruments joint venture. Mr. Klesken said Matsushita and Mitsubishi Corp. are likely candidates as well.    Texas Instruments said it named executive vice president William P. Weber, 44, to succeed Mr. Sick as president of the company's semiconductor group. Mr. Weber currently is in charge of corporate development. </TEXT></DOC>
