The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores said in two Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it plans to sell unprofitable stores valued at a total of $100 million, half in 1988 and the rest in 1989. It also said it may sell another $100 million in convenience and other business assets to repay debt assumed in the leveraged buy-out.    Southland has said it expects to sell its auto-parts stores, dairies, ice business and food and manufacturing units by the end of 1988. But it said the sale of those units is expected to generate $823 million instead of the $900 million originally estimated.    Southland spokesmen couldn't be reached for comment on the filings. As previously reported, Thompson Co., a private concern run by the three sons of Southland's founder, has agreed to acquire the company in a two-step buy-out valued at about $77 a share.    Southland also disclosed that in settling last week several lawsuits filed by shareholders over the buy-out agreement, the company said it wouldn't oppose the plaintiffs' request to be paid $4.3 million for fees and expenses. The company and Thompson settled the suits, filed in state district court here, by slightly increasing the stock portion of the offer to 0.6672 shares of new $25 junior exchangeable preferred from 0.6272 shares of new preferred for each common share owned. Shareholders who receive stock also will receive $61.32 in cash for each of their Southland shares. </TEXT></DOC>
