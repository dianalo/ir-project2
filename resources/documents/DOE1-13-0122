A field-inducing outer electrode enables the capacitorelectrode to be charged by electron transfer through a thin region ofthe layer, this thin region then returning to a very high resistancestate. The charge remaining on the capacitor electrode after irradiationof the dosemeter is a measure of the dose received, and can be measurednon-destructively using two MOSFETs, in a long tail pair network. Thecapacitor electrode may be completely surrounded by silicon dioxide,or alternatively one side may be exposed to a gas in a sealed can.</TEXT></DOC>
