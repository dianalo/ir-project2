Central National Bank of Dallas was closed by federalregulators, and the Texas banking commissioner ordered Home StateBank, Trent, Texas closed, said Bill Olcheski of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. in Washington.   Poor lending practices were cited in the demise of both banks.   The FDIC board of directors approved the assumption of thedeposits and fully secured liaibilities of Central National Bank byDeposit Guaranty Bank, also of Dallas, he said.   The board also approved the transfer of insured deposits andfully secured or preferred deposits of Home State Bank to TheFarmers and Merchants National Bank of Merkel, said Olcheski.   The two bank closings brought the total number of Texas bankfailures so far this year to 18, with one assistance transaction,said Olcheski. Nationwide, 48 banks have failed and the FDIC hasprovided eight assistance transactions.   Federal regulators cited problem loans and a lack of supervisionas causes for Central National's rapid deterioration.   The bank was declared insolvent by Robert J. Herrmann, seniordeputy comptroller for bank supervision of the Office of theComptroller of the Currency, said agency spokesman Dale Underwood.   Central National Bank received a national bank charter on March4, 1983. On March 29, 1988 it had total assets off approximately$14 million.   Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth W. Littlefield announced theclosing of Home State Bank in Trent. The bank had deposits ofapproximately $6 million.   Littlefield said a recent examination identified losses on loansthat depleted the bank's capital. Major losses were attributed topoor lending practices of former management and a weak localeconomy, he said. Efforts to recapitalize the 67-year-oldinstitution were unsuccessful.</TEXT></DOC>
