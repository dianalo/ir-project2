Question: In the post-Cold War world, who cares?                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Actually, there are plenty of reasons to care about thenew Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, or Start, agreement. Itsardent supporters and harsh critics agree it counts for alot, given the uncertain future of U.S.-Soviet relations.That is why there could be a lively debate over ratifying thetreaty, even if the public has long since lost much interestin the arms-control game.   The Start agreement, which will cut strategic arsenalsroughly 30%, almost certainly marks the end of the era ofgrand arms-control treaties. And, some of the cuts Startmandates in superpower arsenals might be made anyway becauseof simple budget restraints in the U.S. and Moscow.   But Start remains relevant because, for a number ofreasons, the Soviets are likely to seek to keep modernizingtheir strategic nuclear arsenal, even if the overall Sovieteconomy continues heading down the tubes in the 1990s.   &quot;The Soviets clearly aren't going to be an economic andtechnological superpower,&quot; says Richard Burt, who untilrecently was the main U.S. negotiator on Start. &quot;If things gowrong in the Soviet Union, if a different group of peoplecame into power, the only avenue there for them to reallyflex their muscles would be in the nuclear area.&quot;   Even if there isn't some cataclysmic change inside theKremlin, U.S. government analysts think that strategicweapons programs are the ones most likely to be maintainedand modernized, even as the rest of the Soviet militarystructure atrophies.   Nuclear weapons may increasingly appear to be the way forthe Soviets to acquire defense on the cheap, because theyprovide far more punch for less money than conventional arms.That could give the Soviets a greater incentive to build upstrategic arms as other programs decline.   Moreover, as the Kremlin's power ebbs in other ways, bigstrategic programs will represent one of its final claims tobe a true world power. That means strategic arms won'treadily be thrown into the dustbin, regardless of whathappens to the overall Soviet defense budget.   In addition, Soviet generals love big strategic arms andthe power they represent, U.S. officials say. So SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev, leery of threats from his ownmilitary, will have a strong bureaucratic incentive to letstrategic programs proceed.   Start matters for a purely U.S. reason as well. Throughdefense cuts being enacted by Congress, the U.S. already isfacing many of the Start cutbacks, without yet having forcedthe Soviets to do the same.   For all those reasons, a treaty that truly restrainsSoviet strategic programs remains highly useful. The debate,then, is over whether the Start treaty is good enough, notwhether it matters.   Treaty proponents argue Start is an especially good dealfor the U.S. because it forces deep cuts in the Soviets'arsenal of big, land-based ballistic missiles, which are theweapons most threatening to the U.S. For instance, the Sovietarsenal of 10-warhead SS-18 missiles would be cut in half, to154. The U.S., meanwhile, is left relatively free in areas inwhich it has technological advantages, such as sea-launchedand air-launched cruise missiles.   The treaty also will force the Soviet side to make largeroverall cuts in warheads. Dunbar Lockwood, an analyst at theArms Control Association, estimates that Start ultimatelywill leave the U.S. with roughly 9,000 strategic warheads, areduction of 25%, while the Soviets will retain roughly7,000, a cut of 35%.   Equally important, Mr. Lockwood maintains, the pact givesthe U.S. a way to &quot;watch the dismantling&quot; of old weapons toensure they are gone.   Critics answer that Start doesn't have the kind ofverification procedures needed to track all the Sovietarsenal, particularly the mobile missiles the Soviets willkeep. More alarming, they say, provisions allowing theSoviets to keep empty warhead slots on their missiles and toretain some missiles in storage give the Kremlin an option tobuild back strategic forces rapidly.   &quot;My sense is that there are a lot of problems with thedetails,&quot; says Frank Gaffney, head of the conservative Centerfor Security Policy.   Regardless of how the debate plays out, the factorscompelling continued Soviet interest in strategic arms alsomean there will be a continued drive in the U.S. to modernizeU.S. strategic weapons, even if Start is ratified. &quot;The bestpossible outcome is an outcome where we modernizestrategically and have Start,&quot; says Mr. Burt. &quot;The worstoutcome is that we don't modernize and we don't have Start.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
