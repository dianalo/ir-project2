The provision, part of the $600 billion spending package to fund the federal government this fiscal year, prohibits the Federal Communications Commission from ending its ban on a company's owning a newspaper and a television station in the same market. In addition, the provision prohibits the FCC from extending any current waivers from that prohibition.    The FCC granted temporary waivers to Mr. Murdoch's News America Corp., allowing the company to sell the Post by next March and the Herald by June so it could comply with FCC regulations banning cross-ownership. News America also owns television stations in Boston and New York.    &quot;This appears to leave no choice for Murdoch but to dispose of the New York Post and Boston Herald,&quot; said Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Acccess Project, a public-interest law firm. An FCC official, who asked not to be named, also said the measure &quot;seems to indicate&quot; the agency couldn't grant Mr. Murdoch any more time to sell the newspapers.    Mr. Murdoch had never filed a request to keep the newspapers permanently. But last month, the Freedom of Expression Foundation, a small Washington research group, asked the FCC to launch a proceeding to eliminate the cross-ownership ban. A News America official said the company planned to file comments about the proposal today, but he wouldn't discuss the effect of the congressional action.    The legislative provision was added at the request of Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), a Senate staffer said. Sen. Hollings acted in his capacity as chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees the FCC, but he could have done so at the request of a colleague. Sen. Hollings couldn't be reached for comment. In any event, the legislative action clearly took the FCC and News America by surprise.    The New York Post has been posting losses steadily for Mr. Murdoch, while the Boston Herald is marginally profitable. In the past few months, Mr. Murdoch has cut several editions of the Post and has begun looking for buyers. British publisher Robert Maxwell is among those who have considered buying the Post.    A separate provision of the omnibus spending bill also blocks the FCC from ending decade-old policies that help minorities and women win new broadcast licenses, and that help minorities buy stations put up for sale. The FCC has said it believes this assistance may be unconstitutional and may encourage scams in which minorities and women act as fronts for companies.    &quot;We can't spend any money (anyway) to continue&quot; considering whether to end the policies, said an FCC official familiar with the legislative provision. </TEXT></DOC>
