In the first lawsuit involving property damage in outer space,the 4th District Court of Appeal dismissed a lawsit filed by five ofthe insurance firms that paid out $105 million after the satellite'sbooster rocket failed moments after its deployment from the shuttleChallenger in February 1984.   Attorneys said this week's ruling likely will further thecommercial use of outer space by preventing astronomical insurancecosts for cargo.   If the insurers had been allowed to seek reimbursement of claimspaid on their clients' losses in space, manufacturers said, theyfeared a resulting flood of costly court cases that would greatlyreduce incentives for commercial space exploration.   The Westar VI communications satellite launched by Challenger wassupposed to reach an orbit 22,000 miles above the earth. It wasdesigned to last 12 years and handle telephone transmissions andtelevision and computer data.   But four seconds after the satellite's rocket ignited, its nozzledisintegrated and its motor shut down. That stranded the satelliteat an altitude of 655 miles, where it was useless.   When Western Union bought the rocket from McDonnell DouglasAstronautics Co., a Huntington Beach subsidiary of McDonnell DouglasCorp., the two companies signed a contract barring any lawsuitsbetween Western Union and McDonnell Douglas, its contractors orsubcontractors.   McDonnell Douglas subcontracted work on the rocket's motor toMorton Thiokol Co. of Chicago and work on its nozzle to Hitco ofGardena, Calif.   Western Union fully insured the satellite, and the insurancecompanies paid Western Union the $105 million value of the satelliteafter the launch failed.   Appalachian Insurance Co. and four other insurers, who paid outabout $5 million of that sum, sued McDonnell Douglas, Morton Thiokoland Hitco, charging negligence and asking for the return of theplaintiffs' money.   Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour ruled in January 1987 thatthe sales contract between Western Union and McDonnell Douglasprohibited the insurers from getting the money back.   The three-judge appeals panel agreed unanimously.</TEXT></DOC>
