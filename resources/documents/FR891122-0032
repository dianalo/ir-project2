MARAD administers these regulationsas a standby emergency program. Under the existing regulations only vesselsregistered under the laws of the United States, as well as certain vesselsthat are owned or controlled by U.S. citizens and registered under thelaws of Panama, Honduras, Liberia and the Bahamas, are eligible to applyfor war risk insurance interim binders. These interim binders insure vesselsagainst liabilities resulting from war or warlike actions when commercialwar risk insurance is unavailable on reasonable terms and conditions. Theproposed amendment would make certain vessels registered in the RMI eligiblefor war risk insurance and subject to the same considerations now applicableto vessels registered under the laws of Panama, Honduras, Liberia and theBahamas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before January 8, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Edmond J.

Implementing war risk insurance regulationswere reissued on December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50165) to provide the terms andconditions under which war risk insurance interim binders are issued forU.S.-flag vessels and certain foreign-flag vessels owned or controlledby U.S. citizens.As authorized by section 1203 of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1283), the Secretarymay provide war risk insurance adequate for the needs of the waterbornecommerce of the United States, if such insurance coverage cannot be obtainedon reasonable terms and conditions from companies authorized to conductan insurance business in a state of the United States. The U.S. Government'swar risk insurance program is a standby emergency program. It becomes effectivesimultaneously with the automatic termination of ocean marine commercialwar risk insurance policies. Those policies are automatically terminatedupon the outbreak of war, whether declared or not, between any of the fivegreat powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, People's Republicof China, or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) or upon the hostiledetonation of a weapon of war employing atomic or nuclear fission and/orfusion or other like reaction or radioactive force or matter. This program makes it possible for applicants to obtain war risk insurance,underwritten by the U.S. Government, when such insurance is unavailableon reasonable terms and conditions in the commercial market. It assuresthe continued flow of essential U.S. trade, while protecting the shipownerfrom loss due to risks of war. A war risk insurance interim binder is a contract under which the U.S.Government agrees to provide the applicant with war risk insurance coveragein the interim period, after termination of commercial insurance coverage,for a fee and upon the conditions set forth in 46 App. U.S.C. 1282. Anagent of MARAD issues the interim binders. War risk insurance interim bindercoverage is available for hull, protection and indemnity and second seamen's(crew life, disability, loss of effects and detention). In 1976, Public Law 94-523 amended the prior war risk authority (46 App.U.S.C. 1283) by requiring that the Secretary shall determine whether togrant war risk insurance or reinsurance to foreign-flag vessels based uponconsideration of ``the characteristics, the employment, and the generalmanagement of the vessel by the owner or charterer.'' This authority wasreinstated in 1979 and 1985, and has been implemented by regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 3, 1980 (45 FR 22041), and December9, 1985 (50 FR 50165), respectively. MARAD's implementing regulations restrict foreign-flag vessel eligibilityfor war risk insurance interim binders. They provide for a case-by-casereview of foreign-flag vessels applying for war risk insurance bindersto assure the continued delivery of important U.S. cargoes when commercialwar risk insurance is unavailable and to make it possible for the U.S.Government to obtain the use of certain foreign-flag vessels under a VoluntaryContract of Commitment (VCC). Vessels now eligible to apply under MARADregulations are those that are documented under the laws of the UnitedStates (except sport fishing vessels), as well as vessels not more than20 years old that are registered under the laws of Panama, Honduras, Liberiaand the Bahamas. Vessels registered under the laws of the RMI would become eligible underthis proposed rule. Owners of these foreign-flag vessels must be U.S. citizens,or U.S. citizen-owned corporations, or the vessels must be under the operationalcontrol of U.S. citizens. These vessels cannot be subject to requisitionfor title or use by any national government, other than the U.S. Government.Further, the foreign country in which the vessel is registered may nothave a statutory restraint preventing the U.S. Government from requisitioninga U.S. citizen-owned or controlled vessel registered in that foreign country.Eligible foreign-flag vessels that qualify for war risk interim bindersare those that are: (1) Substantially engaged in the foreign commerce ofthe United States (considered to be so if they carry 30 percent of netcargo tonnage, on a semiannual basis, in the U.S. foreign commerce); (2)product tankers up to 90,000 deadweight tons; (3) dry cargo vessels; (4)heavy lift vessels; (5) refrigerated vessels; (6) and other classes ofvessels in short supply in the U.S.-flag fleet, with special capabilities.If a vessel meets any of these criteria, the owner must affirm that itwill: (1) Make the vessel available during a U.S. national emergency toserve the U.S. economy or cooperate with U.S. military authorities undersection 902 of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1242); (2) maintain it in its eligiblecategory; and (3) report its location to the U.S. Coast Guard. Vessels owned or controlled by U.S. citizens and registered under the lawsof a foreign government are subject to the laws of the country of registry.Such laws may prevent U.S. citizens or U.S. operators of a foreign-flagvessel from making that vessel available to the U.S. Government duringperiods of U.S. national emergency. MARAD's regulations require that applicantsfor war risk insurance on a foreign-flag vessel submit with their applicationa certified copy of the evidence of any official action or approval requiredby the government of the country of registry as a prerequisite to the executionof a VCC with the U.S. Government (46 CFR 308.3(d)(4)). The VCC betweenthe U.S. Government (MARAD) and the vessel's U.S. citizen applicant makesthat vessel available to the United States during any period in which vesselsmay be requisitioned under section 902 of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1242),i.e., whenever the President proclaims that there is a national emergencyor that security or the national defense make it advisable.This NPRM is issued in recognition of legislation enacted by the RMI in1987 creating a ship registry. The RMI became a sovereign nation on October21, 1986, with the signing of a Compact of Free Association (Pub. L. 99-239),which creates a special relationship between the United States and theRepublic of the Marshall Islands. Under the terms of the Compact, the RMIhas turned over its defenses to the United States in return for a pledgeof foreign aid for a period of 15 years. The Compact is renewable at theend of this period.Under the Compact of Free Association, The Marshalls are embarking uponan aggressive program of economic development. Provisions of the Compactassure the support and cooperation of many U.S. Federal Agencies in creatingfor the Marshall Islands those social services and economic services enjoyedby U.S. citizens. As part of this development program, in 1987, the MarshallIslands passed a Maritime Act creating a ship registry. The Maritime Acthas no statutory restraints preventing the U.S. Government from requisitioninga U.S. citizen-owned or controlled vessel registered in RMI.Since the implementation of the Maritime Act of 1987, the Republic of theMarshall Islands has moved to adhere to Conventions of the InternationalMaritime Organization (IMO) relating to maritime safety. To date, the followingfive treaties are in full force and effect for the Marshall Islands:<ITAG tagnum="25">Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisionsat Sea, 1972, as amended, (COLREGS);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1974) (SOLAS);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Protocol of 1978 amending International Convention for the Safetyof Life at Sea;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">International Load Line Convention (1966); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,1973, as amended, (MARPOL).</ITAG>The safety standards for the issuance of a permanent Certificate of Registrationin the RMI are:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) A valid certificate issued by any of the authorized ClassificationSocieties (American Bureau of Shipping, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas,Germanischer Lloyd, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, Norske Veritas) with respect toCargo or Passenger Safety Equipment; Cargo or Passenger Ship Safety Construction;International Loadline; International Tonnage Measurement; Prevention ofPollution from Ships; and such other certificates as may be applicablepursuant to the IMO convention;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) A Certificate of Seaworthiness of the ship submitted to the MarshallIslands Maritime Authority (MIMA) by the respective authorized ClassificationSocieties prior to the registration of the ship; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) A Ship Radio Station License issued by MIMA upon completion ofsatisfactory inspection by a MIMA marine inspector or surveyors of authorizedClassification Societies.</ITAG>The following safety inspections are required:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Prior to registration_A safety inspection shall be conducted tothe satisfaction of a MIMA marine inspector;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Annual_A MIMA Marine inspector shall conduct an annual safetyinspection and also shall conduct a safety inspection at the time whena safety inspection is being carried by the surveyors of authorized classificationsocieties; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Upon entering a U.S. port_Safety inspections by USCG may be conductedupon ship's entering U.S. ports.</ITAG>As a result of a review of the RMI Maritime Act, the U.S. Navy now regardsU.S. citizen-owned or controlled vessels registered in the RMI as providingavailable cargo capacity to be relief upon to contribute to the cargo sealiftcapability support complementing U.S. strategic defense requirements. TheU.S. Navy has requested that MARAD provide war risk insurance for certainRMI vessels, as appropriate. MARAD believes that RMI registry would bean attractive option to some U.S. citizen owners of eligible vessel typesthat are now under foreign registry.Accordingly, MARAD is proposing to amend its regulations at 46 CFR part308 to provide that certain vessels registered in the RMI be eligible forwar risk insurance interim binders. Such vessels could serve the nationaleconomy and the national defense needs of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Accordingly, the economic impacthas been found to be minimal.This rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmental policies,and is not considered significant under DOT regulatory policies and procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). RMI law now allows entities registeringtheir vessels in the RMI to qualify for U.S. Government issued war riskinsurance binders, subject to enabling amendments to MARAD regulations.There are presently five vessels registered under the RMI-flag, none ofwhich would be eligible for war risk insurance interim binders becausenone are owned by U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens owned corporations, orare under the operational control of U.S. citizens. The U.S. Navy has formallyrecommended to MARAD that eligibility for war risk insurance interim bindersbe extended to the RMI.Since the rule principally affects the owners and operators of large commercialships, the Maritime Administrator certifies that it will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612).This rulemaking does not significantly affect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.This rule would amend the regulations at 46 CFR part 308, which containinformation collection requirements in andSection;andSection; 308.3 and 308.6.The information collection for vessels that are registered in the RMI willbe identical to that which has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). These new forms were approved for use in May 1989 (underOMB Control No. 2133-0011) and are now entitled: War Risk Insurance Application(Form MA-528); War Risk Insurance Binder (Form MA-942); Vessel Data (FormMA-828); and Underwriting Agency Agreement (Form MA-355).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 308</ITAG>Maritime carriers, War risks insurance.Accordingly, 46 CFR part 308 is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 308 [AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
