The extraction with THF for 6 h in soxhletstabilized the fiber sufficiently to maintain the fibrous form in thecarbonization step without any oxidative stabilization, although everyresultant fiber suffered some cracks parallel to the fiber axis. Extractionwith benzene shortened the oxidation, which was required for sufficientstabilization with fewer cracks in the carbonization. In contrast, extractionwith hexane exhibited no influence on the stabilization reactivity. Theremoval of soluble fractions in the mesophase pitch may eliminate itsfusibility completely, decrease the extent of oxidation required forthe stabilization, or raise its softening temperature, enabling stabilizationat a higher temperature. Although the resultant carbon fiber was notexcellent in its properties and the extraction took a long time at presentas far as the thick fiber which was examined, a thinner fiber (10 {mu}m)required a much shorter extraction time (with benzene 30 min. at roomtemperature) and less oxidation for the complete stabilization.</TEXT></DOC>
