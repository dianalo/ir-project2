93% worked inmulti-vendor environments, 66% felt industry standards were more importantthan vendor-specific standards when purchasing computer systems.andM;- o -andM;Informix Software Inc says that it plans next year to offer versions of itsWingz graphic spreadsheet for the NeXT Computer System, for OS/2 withPresentation Manager, for MS-Windows, an Open Desktop Wingz for the Motifinterface and Wingz for Unix workstations; it is presently offered on Macunder A/UX.andM;- o -andM;Texas Instruments Inc is going into the building block business on its ownaccount, developing a Business Graphics Array logic controller for itsTI34010 graphics signal processor for those wanting to design VGA-compatibleboards with higher resolutions up to 1,024 by 768 pixels: the 34092integrates many of the chips needed to build a high-resolution graphics boardaround the 34010, including memory controller and a display pipelinecontroller, which controls the resolution and colour palette, reducing byhalf the size of the board needed, and Microbytes Daily suggests it could cutthe price of boards to $500 or $600 from the present near-$1,000; samples areset for early next year with volume in mid-1990; a version for the new,faster 34020 chip is also planned.andM;- o -andM;Wearnes Technology Pte Ltd and United Engineers Ltd, both of Singapore, havedeclared a combined 7.6% stake in Qume Corp &quot;for investment purposes&quot;, butsay they may seek to take control of the displays and printers company at alater date.andM;- o -andM;North Atlantic Industries Inc has called off its proposed acquisition for$25.8m by Asset Management Associates, because the two failed to reach finalagreement on terms.andM;- o -andM;Siemens Information Systems Inc in Cherry Hill, New Jersey has integrated itshigh-capacity 5.25&quot;
