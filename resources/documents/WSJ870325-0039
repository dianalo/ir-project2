Units of Salomon Inc., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc., itself a unit of American Express Corp., and Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. have moved within the last five weeks to limit their exposure to Drexel in precious metals and other commodities trading, mostly because of uncertainty over the implications of the government probes, traders at the investment banking firms say. The four firms either have tightened credit limits on dealings with Drexel or halted direct dealings with the firm in some areas, the traders say.    In addition, some U.S. oil companies, which deal with the Drexel Burnham Trading Corp. unit in the international oil markets, also are known to have initiated credit reviews. Standard Oil Co., as a result of its review, moved in January to require letters of credit on transactions with Drexel after trading for more than a year without such restrictions, traders say.    Officials of the investment banking firms declined to confirm the moves, and their traders also were reluctant to give full details because of the sensitive nature of the subject and out of a desire to remain anonymous.    Drexel, though, confirmed such actions. &quot;There are just a handful of firms which have indicated restrictions in dealing with us, but they generally are among our primary competitors in the precious metals and oil markets, and they obviously have their own agenda,&quot; said a Drexel spokesman, who asked not to be identified. He declined to identify firms that either have imposed more severe credit limits than in the past or suspended trading activities with Drexel. &quot;The commodities department continues to do business with the vast majority of its customers,&quot; he also said.    A statement by Drexel said its commodites unit, DBL Trading Corp, hasn't been hurt by the actions. The group &quot;is operating normally and very profitably,&quot; the statement said.    U.S. and foreign oil concerns, traders say, are dealing with Drexel only when protected by what are known as &quot;bookout&quot; provisions in &quot;daisy chain&quot; transactions that involve the on-paper exchange of one cargo among many trading companies.    Under a bookout, which became standard practice during 1986 in North Sea and Alaskan North Slope crude oil, traders don't exchange the full cash-value of the cargoes they deal in, but rather the net profit or loss on paper after the single cargo has passed through their hands several times. If a trading concern defaults in making delivery or taking delivery of the cargo, the loss is limited to a small percentage of the shipment's full market value.    The insider probe's impact on other firms' dealings with Drexel hasn't been limited to the commodities arena. Drexel officials have said in recent weeks that the firm lost two merger assignments because of the controversy, and some retail stockbrokerage accounts as well. Some other firms won't make short-term loans to Drexel backed with government securities and some foreign banks won't do interestrate swaps with Drexel, the officals have said.    Although there isn't any evidence Drexel is an unfit trading partner, top-level executives at the four investment banks and credit officials at the oil companies are seeking to reduce potential risks in the event federal probes result in charges against Drexel that would severely impair the company's ability to perform, traders say.    The limitations on dealings with Drexel vary by firm and don't apply to all the company's operations, but several companies &quot;have said that until the Boesky thing is cleared up, they'll be cutting back&quot; their exposure to Drexel, a trader close to the firm said. The cutbacks, though, &quot;haven't been substantial,&quot; the trader said.    The actions by Drexel's competitors follow credit reviews started since Dennis Levine, a key Drexel mergers and acquisition executive, was charged in May 1986 with insider-trading violations, said Drexel traders, who agreed to speak only if their identities weren't disclosed. Mr. Levine subsequently pleaded guilty to the charges that stemmed from his dealings prior to joining Drexel.    The credit reviews upset some Drexel officials because no one who has been indicted was with Drexel when the alleged insider trading took place, a trader close to Drexel said. &quot;But these things tend to have a snowball effect,&quot; the trader said.    Since early February, though, when reports began pinpointing the nature of the federal inquiries into Drexel's dealings with arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, the investment banks and U.S. oil companies began giving more serious consideration to Drexel's credit.    Neither Drexel nor any of its officials have been charged with wrongdoing, and Drexel has said repeatedly that it doesn't know of any wrongdoing by anyone at the firm.    Drexel also rejects any concern about its credit. Drexel has &quot;capital of $1.9 billion, the fourth largest on Wall Street, equity of $1.3 billion and excess net capital of $1 billion,&quot; the firm said in yesterday's statement.    &quot;We are about to close a quarter which will prove exceedingly profitable, and our revenues and market share in trading and financing activities continue to grow from already strong positions,&quot; Drexel said.    &quot;Any questions raised about our credit conditions are ridiculous, as those few competitors who have instituted restrictions, for whatever motives, well know,&quot; the company said. &quot;People who invent and circulate rumors about any financial institutions, including Drexel Burnham, are doing a grave disservice to the investing public and the marketplace,&quot; the statement concluded.    The investment banks also are seeking to reduce concerns about their own creditworthiness at a time when Wall Street is being hit by its worst insider-trading scandal, say traders at firms that haven't taken any credit action against Drexel.    &quot;Everybody on Wall Street is under the microscope right now,&quot; a trader with a Japanese securities firm said. &quot;But Drexel is definitely the focus of attention.&quot;    ---   Steve Swartz and Michael Siconolfi contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
