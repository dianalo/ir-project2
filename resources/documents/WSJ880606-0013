The pickings during the Reagan administration for a match to Jimmy Carter's top antimarket regulator were admittedly slim, but we can announce an eminently qualified winner. David Ruder, come on down!    Mr. Ruder has been chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission for less than a year, but he already has a long list of regulatory excesses to his credit. He is best known for his willingness to shut down the New York Stock Exchange on October 19. He's been the odd man out when Reagan officials testify to Congress about new post-crash regulations.    Mr. Ruder has such a zeal to regulate that two of his commissioners are ready to roll him off the gangplank. Commissioner Joseph Grundfest left Mr. Ruder sputtering at a recent agency meeting when he accused him of &quot;regulatory imperialism.&quot; He was referring especially to Mr. Ruder's turf battle over stock index futures with free-marketeer Wendy Gramm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Commissioner Edward Fleischman dismissed Mr. Ruder's regulatory takeover bid as &quot;folly.&quot;    Bad enough, but now Mr. Ruder's SEC has declared war on the most fundamental concept of the free market -- sanctity of contract. This past week, the agency proposed to prohibit the established practice of brokers and their customers signing agreements that any dispute between them must go to binding arbitration instead of to the federal courts. At a time when everyone else in America is trying to damp the fires of the litigation explosion, Mr. Ruder wants to get a new one going.    Arbitration became the industry custom partly to protect the informality of being able to call a broker with an order without exchanging teams of lawyers and notaries. The system has worked well. Arbitration is cheaper than litigation, which would often be more costly than the customer's claim is worth. Most of the disputes are over improper execution of orders or churning, turning over portfolios just to gain commissions. Nearly half the New York Stock Exchange cases are settled before they go to arbitration. When they do, arbitrators rule for the customers half the time.    Some smart lawyers decided that arbitration was working too well as an alternative to litigation. For one thing, arbitration deprived them of contingency-fee access to some of the deepest pockets around. They began to file cases in federal court alleging broker fraud. They demanded punitive damages and lawyers' fees. It got to the point that in recent years nearly half of all the cases based on RICO, the treble-damages law aimed at organized crime, were instead filed against brokers. Then the Supreme Court this past summer spoiled all the fun by rejecting the hundreds of these lawsuits by upholding the arbitration requirement. An agreement to arbitrate is an agreement, it said, a deal is a deal.    Thus rebuffed, the trial lawyers bent the ears of Democratic congressmen John Dingell and Edward Markey. They began to make squishy noises about &quot;unfair bargaining position,&quot; &quot;contracts of adhesion,&quot; and other chestnuts invoked whenever someone wants to wiggle out of an agreement. The SEC strategy apparently is to beat Congress to the regulatory punch, not protect markets.    Mr. Ruder somehow seems to think that the measure of a regulatory agency is how much it can regulate. Perhaps no one explained it to Mr. Ruder when he was appointed, but the Reagan revolution teaches the opposite lesson. </TEXT></DOC>
