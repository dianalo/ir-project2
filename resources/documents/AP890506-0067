Genscher has been the designated architect of West Germanforeign policy for 15 years, the longest-serving foreign ministerin the West.   He has charted the course for the nation's steady drift to theEast, expressing an eagerness for every chance to close thecapitalist-communist chasm. And he has stood guard over the gainsof Ostpolitik, the strategy forged by former Chancellor WillyBrandt a generation ago to foster better relations between theGerman states.   Behind the 62-year-old politician's quest for better East-Westrelations is a life deeply influenced by Germany's tragic past.   Genscher was born in the Saxon town of Halle, now part of EastGermany, and returned to the Soviet-occupied sector of his homelandafter capture by Americans and imprisonment in Britain until theend of World War II.   After studying law at Leipzig University and growingdisenchanted with the new socialist state, he escaped to the Westin 1952 and entered politics by joining the small, liberal FreeDemocratic Party.   Now firmly in place as one of the nation's most popularpoliticians, Genscher has been at the forefront of a West Germanscramble to take advantage of new opportunities for East-Westcooperation brought about by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Impervious to warnings from other NATO allies that it may be toosoon to match initiatives from a Kremlin that remains better armedthan the West, Genscher has been pushing for a new round ofsuperpower talks aimed at removing short-range missiles from WestGerman territory.   He has appealed to the allies to trust Gorbachev and ``take himat his word.''   He has made clear he aims for a dismantling of the divisions ofEurope, in particular the concrete and barbed-wire border dividingthe two Germanies.   In a speech to the federal Parliament last week, Genscher statedthat his responsibility for guiding German policy ``does not end atthe border running through the middle of Germany. This obligationincludes my home, the city in which I was born.''   Noting that Germans brought about the world war that left thecontinent sharply divided into two opposing political blocs,Genscher has often observed with a note of contrition that ``Europeis our fate.''   Critics have accused him of seeking a break with the Westernalliance, or of trying to give West Germany the first foot in thedoor of potential economic deals with East bloc countries,solidifying West Germany's role as the primary economic power inEurope.   But Genscher has steadfastly said he wants a peaceful andprosperous Europe and a freer exchange between the two Germanies.   ``Genscher has the specific interests of Western Europe inmind,'' said Heinz Timmermann of Cologne's Institute for Easternand International Studies. ``It has nothing to do with thegovernment wanting a special path, nothing to do with neutrality.''   Long troubled by health problems, including tuberculosis andthree heart attacks, Genscher has rebounded from his most recentbout with illness and the death a few months ago of his 88-year-oldmother.   He was hospitalized in March for surgery to correct aurinary-tract problem, but his staff reports he has returned to hisgrueling 16-hour-a-day schedule and has shown no signs of tiring.</TEXT></DOC>
