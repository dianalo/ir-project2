But the crucial original intent was that in the 13 states.    As Madison told the House of Representatives in April 1796 regarding the Constitutional Convention: &quot;As the instrument came from them it was nothing more than the draft of a plan, nothing but a dead letter, until life and validity were breathed into it by the voice of the people, speaking through the several state conventions. If we were to look, therefore, for the meaning of the instrument beyond the face of the instrument, we must look for it, not in the general convention, which proposed, but in the state conventions, which accepted and ratified the Constitution.&quot;    Prof. George Steven Swan   School of Law   St. Thomas University   Miami</TEXT></DOC>
