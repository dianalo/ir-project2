TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.^By NESHA STARCEVIC</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Striking shipyard workers today rejected acompromise that would have forced them to end their weeklong strikeand drop their demand for legalization of Solidarity in exchangefor a pay raise.   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' the workers chantedat a rally this morning as they rejected the compromise offered bymanagement following a four-hour negotiating session with thestrike committee, union sources said.   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, saidthe 400 to 500 workers at the shipyard repeatedly screamed ``no''when told of the offer.   The tentative deal had taken shape in talks revived at theinitiative of a Politburo member on Sunday, strike leaders said.Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, a ranking communist partyPolitburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator torevive the talks after they broke down late Sunday afternoon,according to accounts given by strike committee members.   The conversations between Kiszczak and lawyer WladyslawSila-Nowicki, a former Solidarity member who has since agreed toserve on Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's consultativecitizens' council, led to new talks.   As a result, the strike committee wrote a letter to managementon Sunday in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone itslong-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the followingconditions:   _Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers andthe people who have assisted them.   _Promises of no discipliantry action against strikers, includingfines, dismissals or prosecutions.   _A wage increase of $38 dollars on the average monthly wage ofthe last three months, or about $105.   _Formation of a joint committee from members of the strikecommittee and the shipyard workers' council to overseeimplementation of the agreement.   Management ultimately agreed to a raise of $39 monthly based onthe average wage in the third quarter of 1987, when wages weresomewhat lower, strike sources said. The average pay for thatquarter was not immediately available.   In addition, strike sources said, there was a promise that firedSolidarity activists would be rehired, but only if the shipyard wasshort of manpower, and an oral promise that some unspecifiedpolitical prisoners would be freed.   The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1,000reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reportersthere Sunday. Walesa has remained among the workers at the plant.The strike began May 2.   A settlement would have ended a two-week wave of labor unrestwhich the government has said is threatening Poland's reputationabroad and its economic reform plans at home. It has been Poland'sworst labor upheaval since the 1981 military crackdown the precededthe outlawing of Solidarity.   The union, born in the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, was thefirst independent trade union in the East bloc.   Meanwhile, Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal JozefGlemp, spoke out Sunday for the right of all people to participatein society's decisions. His sermon followed a statement Saturday byPolish-born Pope John Paul II that strikes can be justified andPoland lacked ``true democracy.''   And 55 intellectuals and oppositionists charged in an openletter that the government's policy of national reconciliation is a``game of appearances.''   On Sunday, management told workers inside the shipyard theycould face discipline or arrest if they did not leave by 6 p.m.,said Konopka. The workers ignored the ultimatum.   The government has never ruled out the use of force to end thestrike. A predawn raid by a police anti-terrorist unit and riotpolice crushed a 10-day strike by steelworkers in Nowa Huta insouthern Poland on Thursday.   On Sunday morning, at least 7,000 slogan-chanting peopleattended a church service to support the workers on strike for aseventh day.   Thousands of police reappeared on the streets of this Balticport city to maintain order around St. Brygida's Church, whereworshippers rallied and heard a rousing speech by the Rev. HenrykJankowski, a friend and adviser of Walesa.   Food supplies were choked off in a police blockade in placesince Thursday. Children as young as 8 and 10 have been sneakinginto the shipyard with a little food, notes and cigarettes, he said.   In the wave of strikes that began April 25, workers have pressedfor higher wages to counteract inflation hitting 42 percent in thefirst three months of 1988. Authorities have argued that some ofthe strikes were instigated by ``professional politicians,''especially leaders of Solidarity, who want to exploit Poland'seconomic troubles for political ends.</TEXT></DOC>
