L. 99-509,the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which amended section 466(a)of the Social Security Act (the Act), effective October 21, 1986. Section9103 requires that, as a condition of State IV-D plan approval, Stateshave in effect laws requiring the use of procedures to prohibit retroactivemodification of child support arrearages. However, such procedures maypermit modification with respect to any period during which there is pendinga petition for modification, but only from the date that notice has beengiven, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligeeor (where the petitioner is the obligee) to the obligor. Specifically,State IV-D agencies must have in effect and use procedures whereby anypayment or installment of support under any child support order is, onand after the date it is due, a judgment by operation of law, with thefull force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State and is entitled,as such, to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State.A clear implication of child support becoming a final judgment when dueis that when there is more than one child support order for the same child,absent parents owe the amount of the order providing the greatest support.If, for example, a Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA)order requires $150 child support while a divorce order requires $200,the full $200 becomes a final judgment. If the State of residence of theabsent parent enforces $150 for current support, the absent parent stillowes the additional $50 as an accumulated arrearage. It would generallybe more efficient for the absent parent's State to enforce the originalorder, without the need to obtain a new or revised order. Interstate wagewithholding offers this efficiency when the absent parent is a wage-earner.The Social Security Act requires that wage withholding systems includecases where the applicable support orders were issued in other States.It would be desirable to have similarly efficient processes for cases withother types of income and assets. The requirement that the Secretary promulgaterules necessary for efficient administration, so long as they are not inconsistentwith other parts of the relevant statutes, authorizes the Secretary torequire changes that would simplify and expedite interstate cases. TheDepartment hopes that the Interstate Child Support Commission establishedby the Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. l00-485) will suggest ways tomove towards a more efficient process while still preserving due processrights. While the effective date of this statute was October 21, 1986, under section9103(b)(2) of Pub. L. 99-509, if a State demonstrates to the Secretary,HHS, that State legislation is required to conform the State IV-D planto the requirements of this statute, a delay based on the need for legislationmay be granted. In such a case, the State's plan would not be regardedas failing to comply solely by reason of its failure to meet the requirementsimposed by the new amendments until the beginning of the fourth month beginningafter the end of the first session of the State's legislature which endson or after October 21, 1986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> April 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Michael Fitzgerald, Policy Branch,OCSE (202) 252-5366.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Public reporting burden for the collections of information requirementsat 45 CFR 302.70(a)(9), 303.106(a), 303.106(b) and 305.57 is estimatedto average 10, 1,000, .5 and 1,000 minutes per response respectively, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information.

L. 99-509 is a result of Congress' recognition ofthe disparity among States regarding the treatment of child support orders,and in particular, a concern about State laws and practices permittingmodification of child support arrearages. Although most States permit childsupport orders to be modified only prospectively, thus affecting only futurechild support payments, some States have accorded child support ordersa lesser stature than other money judgments, and have allowed child supportawards to be modified retroactively. In such States, the court or administrativeentity has had the authority to r+duce or nullify arrearages by reducingthe amounts owed for past periods.Prior to enactment of section 9103 of Pub. L. 99-509, 18 States permittedchild support orders to be modified retroactively. The vast majority ofsuch retroactive modifications when they occurred had the effect of reducingthe amount of child support ordered. Thus, for example, an order for $200a month for child support, which was unpaid for 36 months, should accumulatean arrearage of $7,200. Yet, if the obligor was brought to court, havingmade no prior attempt to modify the order, the order might be reduced to$100 a month retroactive to 36 months prior to the date of modification.This has the effect of reducing the arrearage from $7,200 to $3,600. Theorder could be reduced without placing any diligence requirement on theabsent parent to petition in a timely manner to reduce the order, if forsome reason his or her ability to comply with the order had changed. Suchlaws further permitted arguments to be made about changed circumstancesin prior periods at a time when evidence may not have been easily attainedor available. Rebuttal, by the obligee, thus, was extremely difficult.In interstate cases involving registration of out-of-State child supportorders, where the absent parent resided in a State different from the onewhere his or her children resided or where the child support order wasentered, the problem of retroactive modification was exacerbated. In suchcases, the custodial parent usually could not be present when the casewas heard in the absent parent's State and was thus unable to testify aboutany claimed past change in circumstances.In addition to the 18 States which prior to enactment of Pub. L. 99-509permitted retroactive modification of child support orders, 17 other Statesdid not require reducing child support debts to final judgment as the paymentsbecame due. As a result, the child support debts were not entitled to fullfaith and credit in other States as is the case with other money judgments.In light of this situation, section 9103 added a new requirement to section466(a) of the Act which States must meet in order to have an approved titleIV-D State Plan. Specifically, under section 466(a)(9), States must havein effect laws requiring the use of procedures under which any paymentor installment on a child support order is a judgment, on and after thedate each payment is due, and retroactive modification of child supportorders is prohibited with the following exception. Modification may bepermitted with respect to any period during which there is pending a petitionfor modification, but only from the date notice of such petition has beengiven, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligeeor (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.In the past, when an absent parent moved out of the State where a supportobligation had been established, the IV-D agency representing the custodialparent often would be required to use the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcementof Support Act (URESA) in order to obtain an enforceable order in the absentparent's new State of residence. Using URESA is time consuming and frustratingfor the custodial parent owed a support obligation. Under URESA, the absentparent generally has the opportunity to allege inability to pay the previouslyestablished support amount, which may result in a lower support order beingentered. Under the requirement specified by section 9103, all child supportorders in a State, including orders entered before October 21, 1986, cannow be enforced by any other State (e.g., by registration under the UniformEnforcement of Foreign Judgments Act) without creating a new child supportorder. Such a provision will ensure that the processing of interstate caseswill be less time consuming and less costly when the custodial parent alreadyhas a child support order, and child support collections will increasebecause accumulated arrearage debts will stay intact and not be reducedor forgiven. Specific remedies to enforce these judgments will be determinedby the State where the judgment was entered or is registered, pursuantto State law.Section 9103 of Pub. L. 99-509 adds a ninth mandatory procedure to section466(a) of the Act which requires States to have in effect laws requiringthe use of certain procedures to increase the effectiveness of their childsupport enforcement programs in order to have an approved title IV-D Stateplan. The previously existing mandatory procedures are:(1) Wage withholding;(2) Expedited processes to establish and enforce child support obligations;(3) State income tax refund offset;(4) Imposition of liens against real and personal property;(5) Establishment of paternity at least until the child's 18th birthday;(6) Requiring an absent parent to give security or post a bond or someother guarantee to secure payment of support;(7) Making information regarding the amount of overdue support owed byan absent parent available to consumer reporting agencies; and(8) Provision for wage withholding in all child support orders which areissued or modified in the State.The new mandatory procedure added by section 9103 requires that any paymentor installment of support under any child support order, whether orderedthrough the State judicial system or through the State's expedited processes,is (on and after the date it is due):(A) A judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributesof a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced;(B) entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and inany other State; and(C) not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any otherState.However, such procedures may permit modification with respect to any periodduring which there is pending a petition for modification, but only fromthe date that notice has been given, either directly or through the appropriateagent, to the obligee (or where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.While the effective date of this statute is October 21, 1986, under section9103(b)(2) of Pub. L. 99-509, if a State demonstrates to the Secretary,HHS, that State legislation is required to conform the State IV-D planto the requirements of the statute, a delay in implementation based onthe need for legislation may be granted. In such a case, the State's IV-Dplan would not be regarded as failing to comply with the requirements imposedby the amendment until the beginning of the fourth month beginning afterthe end of the first session of the State's legislature which ends on orafter October 21, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>This final rule is published under the authority of section 1102 of theSocial Security Act (the Act) which requires the Secretary to publish regulationsthat may be necessary for the efficient administration of the functionsfor which he is responsible under the Act. Section 454(20) of the Act requiresState plans to provide that States have in effect laws requiring the useof the procedures prescribed in section 466 of the Act to increase theeffectiveness of their Child Support Enforcement programs, and have implementedprocedures regarding such laws. Section 9103 of Pub. L. 99-509 added anew paragraph (9) under section 466(a) which requires that States havein effect laws requiring the use of procedures which provide that any paymentor installment of support under any child support order is a judgment,entitled to full faith and credit, and not subject to retroactive modification.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Provisions</ITAG>This regulation revises andSection; 302.70(a) to specify that the effectivedate for paragraphs (1) through (8) is October 1, 1985 and for paragraph(9) is October 21, 1986.In addition, this regulation adds a new paragraph (9) under andSection; 302.70(a)to require that any payment or installment of support under any child supportorder is, on and after the date it is due, a judgment, and may not be modifiedretroactively.This regulation also amends 45 CFR Part 303 to add a new andSection; 303.106entitled Procedures to prohibit retroactive modification of child supportarrearages. Paragraph (a) of this section requires States to have in effectand use procedures which provide that any payment of child support, onand after the date it is due, is a judgment, by operation of law. Thisrequirement provides that the child support installment must become a judgmentwithout the need for any action by an entity; it becomes a judgment simplyby a payment falling due. Paragraph (a)(2) of andSection; 303.106 requiresthat the judgment be entitled to full faith and credit in the originatingState and in any other State. Full faith and credit is a Constitutionalprinciple which provides that the various States must recognize the judgmentsof the other States within the United States and accord them the forceand effect they would have in their home State.Paragraph (a)(3) states that the judgment is not subject to retroactivemodification, except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section. Theintent of this requirement is to prohibit courts or administrative entitiesfrom forgiving or reducing arrearages.Paragraph (b) provides for the exception referred to in paragraph (a)(3)that permits limited retroactive modification of child support orders.The first condition is that modification may be permitted by the Statefor any period during which there is pending a petition for modification.The second condition requires that the modification may only be permittedfrom the date that notice of such petition has been given, either directlyor through the appropriate agent to the obligee or (where the obligee isthe petitioner) to the obligor.These regulations also amend the audit regulations by adding a new andSection;305.57 entitled Retroactive modification of child support arrearages. Thisaudit criterion provides that, in order to meet the requirements of titleIV-D, the State must have laws in effect and be using procedures whichrequire that any payment or installment of support under any child supportorder is, on and after the date it is due, a judgment, and may not be modifiedretroactively, except as provided in 45 CFR 303.106 of this chapter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment </ITAG>A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 34689) on September 14, 1987. The commentperiod ended on November 13, 1987. We received 12 written comments fromState and local agencies, 8 from organizations and 2 from private citizens.Although no changes were made to the regulatory language itself as a resultof comments, the comments and our responses are discussed below. General Comments 1. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the proposed regulation statingthat it is virtually identical to the statute and provides no guidanceto the States which is inconsistent with section 1102 of the Social SecurityAct. <T3>Response:</T3> We believe that Federal law and regulations regardingthe prohibition of retroactive modification of support arrearages are clearand precise. Guidance is largely unnecessary because the law leaves littleroom for interpretation. The States should have little trouble implementingthese provisions by close adherence to the statutory language.  2. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter indicated that the law regarding the prohibitionof retroactive modification of support arrearages requires that the otherparty receive a notice of the petition but does not address sending subsequentnotices of court proceedings to that party. The commenter said that noticeof each step in the process would enable the custodial parent to participateif desired. <T3>Response:</T3> Federal law and regulations only require the party requestingthe modification to send the other party a notice regarding the petitionto modify support arrearages. State due process requirements should ensurethat all parties to a proceeding to modify support arrearages receive anotice regarding any subsequent proceedings. If the State, as assigneeof the support rights, receives such notices, the IV-D agency should keepthe custodial parent informed regarding the status of any action to modifysupport arrearages in accordance with the new law. 3. <T3>Comment: </T3>With respect to the delay in implementation built intothe statute, a comment was received on the definition of the term ``session''as any regular, special, budget, or other session of a State legislature.The commenter suggested that we work with Congress to get the definitionof the term ``session'' revised to include only ``regular''  sessions ofa State legislature. <T3>Response:</T3> The term ``session,'' as defined in the delay of implementationprovision of the new law, is identical to the definition of the same termfound in the delay of implementation provisions in the Child Support EnforcementAmendments of 1984. We believe that the definition of the term ``session''as used in these provisions has encouraged the States to implement Federalrequirements as soon as possible. 4. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be conducted due to the additional cost and effort that may berequired because of the requirement that support payments are judgmentson and after the date they are due. <T3>Response:</T3> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L.96-354), we are required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis forthose rules which will have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. We believe that the requirement that paymentsbecome judgments on and after the date they are due will save the Statesmoney and time. The cost of interstate enforcement activities, in particular,will be reduced because there is no longer a need for a State to incurcosts  or expend efforts to obtain an in-State child support order beforethe State can enforce past-due support owed under another State's order.Since we believe that the net effect of these requirements will be costsavings, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Judgment 5. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters indicated that, because any payment orinstallment is now a separate judgment on and after the date it is due,the collection of support will be more complicated, costly and time consuming.Also, the commenters stated that judgments are obtained for direct collectionand to notify third parties, either creditors or potential lenders, thatthe obligor has a settled debt that can be applied as a lien against property.The commenters further stated that the requirement that each payment orinstallment of support is a judgment as of the date it is due will confusethird parties who must conduct business based on the current situationof the obligor. <T3>Response:</T3> We do not believe that the establishment of separatejudgments for each payment or installment of child support on the dateit is due makes the collection of support more complicated, costly, andtime consuming. States may collect past-due support without seeking  additionalcourt or administrative action to reduce the amount due to a judgment.Currently, the States maintain records on the amount of support owed andpaid on a monthly or weekly basis. Many States maintain these records onefficient and effective automated systems at minimal cost. The maintenanceof information regarding separate judgments should not place an additionalburden on the States. Creditors or potential lenders can seek credit information on absent parentsfrom consumer credit reporting agencies which can request information onchild support arrearages from the IV-D agencies, Clerks of Court, or otherState payment registries. States should maintain payment records whichinclude the current total of the child support arrearages for each childsupport case. Child support arrearages should be treated as any other debt,and, if in arrears, the obligation may result in a lien against propertyof the obligor in accordance with State law. 6. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters indicated that the regulatory provisionsregarding payments becoming judgments by operation of State law when theyfall due should be revised to indicate that: (1) Judgments must be recordedmonthly; (2) the judgment must be accompanied by a certification of theobligee that the amount of the arrearage is accurate; and (3) notice ofthe judgment must be sent to the obligor. These commenters believe thatthese changes will virtually eliminate requests from obligors to open orstrike a judgment, and lessen the number of errors in the amounts of judgmentswhich impact real estate searches and credit reports.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not believe the commenters' suggested changesare warranted. State child support case payment records, in most States,should eliminate the need for: (1) Recording judgments periodically; or(2) obtaining certification from the obligee that the amount of the judgment(arrearage) is accurate. States that have inadequate child support paymentrecords will have to make the changes necessary to maintain current andaccurate record keeping systems. There is certainly no need to send a noticeof each incremental change in the judgment to the obligor since he or sheis responsible for meeting the obligation and will know when he or shehas failed to do so. Finally, Federal law regarding the prohibition ofretroactive modification of support arrearages should limit requests fromobligors to open or strike a judgment.7.<T3> Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the regulatory provision thatmakes any child support payment or installment, under a support order,a judgment as of the date it is due because: (1) It is contrary to standardlaw and practice; (2) it raises a Constitutional issue regarding separationof powers; and (3) it violates the obligor's due process rights.<T3>Response:</T3> Federal law provides that any payment or installmentof support under any child support order is, on and after the date it isdue, a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributesof a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced. The commenterdid not explain how the principle of separation of powers is allegedlyviolated, but this requirement has long been the established law of manyStates and we are unaware of any challenges on Constitutional grounds.We believe that Congress is simply requiring States to afford child supportdebts the same status as other court or administratively ordered debtsin the State that are considered judgments.In addition, the commenter did not explain how due process was violated.The child support obligor's due process rights are protected under Statelaw when the support obligation is established. Also, the obligor, subjectto enforcement of a child support judgment, is entitled to the same dueprocess protections that apply to the enforcement of other judgments inthe State. For example, an obligor who alleges that all payments to thecustodial parent have been made, may be entitled under State law to a hearingbefore the court or administrative authority.8.<T3> Comment:</T3> One commenter asked how long it generally takes a courtto act on a petition for modification of support. The commenter also recommendedthat the regulations specify a time frame within which a final judgmentmust be issued after a petition for modification of a support order isfiled because the custodial parent may face problems without the additionalsupport.<T3>Response:</T3> Historically, there have been large backlogs of childsupport cases in State courts awaiting resolution. However, as a resultof the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, Federal regulationsgoverning the Child Support Enforcement program at 45 CFR 303.101 requirethe States to have in effect and use expedited processes (administrativeand/or expedited judicial processes) to establish and enforce child supportorders. Under expedited processes, actions to establish and enforce supportorders in IV-D cases must be completed from the time of filing to the timeof disposition within the following timeframes: (1) In 90 percent of allcases, within 3 months, (2) 98 percent in 6 months; and (3) 100 percentin 12 months. This standard also applies to the modification of supportorders in IV-D cases under expedited processes unless complex issues areinvolved requiring judicial resolution (45 CFR 303.101(b)(4)).Prohibition of Retroactive Modification9.<T3> Comment:</T3> A commenter indicated that the prohibition of retroactivemodification of support orders requirement does not provide exceptionsfor individuals who are unable to promptly file for modification due tosevere injury or sudden lengthy illness. Several commenters objected tothe prohibition of retroactive modification of support because it requiresthe obligor who obtains custody of a child or is temporarily out of workto immediately file a petition to modify the support order and appliesto the obligor who may have to satisfy arrearages that accrued after achild died or was emancipated.<T3>Response:</T3> Federal law does not provide for any exception to theprohibition of retroactive modification of support arrearages other thanfor the period after the date notice of the petition for modification isgiven until the modification occurs. Congress in Senate Report No. 99-348,page 155, and in the Conference Report No. 99-1012, Page 273, indicatedthat, if the non-custodial parent's circumstances change because of unemployment,illness or another such reason, the non-custodial parent is responsiblefor notifying the custodial parent and the court or entity that issuedthe child support order of the changed circumstances and his or her intentionto modify the support order. The obligor is in the best position to knowof a change in circumstances and bring it to the attention of the courtor administrative authority.It is the obligor's responsibility to take action promptly to seek modificationof a support obligation based on a change in his or her circumstances.The obligor or his or her representative should immediately, upon the developmentof any circumstances that inhibit his or her ability to pay support, filea petition with the court or administrative authority to modify the supportorder. These circumstances might include: (1) The obligor is unable topay support due to confinement or incarceration in a mental or penal institution;(2) the child goes to live with the obligor; (3) the child is emancipatedor dies; (4) the obligor becomes permanently, or temporarily disabled,or seriously ill, with no benefits, earning capacity or assets; or (5)the obligor becomes unemployed. If the obligor cannot afford legal counsel,the obligor should seek assistance from any available public legal services.Federal law and regulations do not preclude the States from having lawsthat permit automatic prospective suspension or prospective terminationof the support obligation upon the development of specific circumstancessuch as the emancipation or death of a child. Such ``modifications by operationof law'' upon the occurrence of an event known to both parties, if applicablegenerally to all child support orders in the State, would not appear tocontradict the intent of the law. We would caution, however, that any apparent``exceptions'' to the general rule barring retroactive modification ofsupport orders will be closely scrutinized for purposes of determiningState IV-D plan conformity.Enforcement of child support judgments should be treated the same as enforcementof other judgments in the State, and a child support judgment would alsobe subject to the equitable defenses that apply to all other judgments.Thus, if the obligor presents to the court or administrative authoritya basis for laches or an equitable estoppel defense, there may be circumstancesunder which the court or administrative authority will decline to permitenforcement of the child support judgment. We do not, however, believethat a temporary loss of employment or even a change of actual custodyof the child should result in a modification of support liability unlessthe court or administrative authority is duly notified and sanctions suchmodification.10. <T3>Comment:</T3> Another commenter indicated that the provisions regardingthe prohibition of retroactive modification of support arrearages resultin deprivation of Constitutional rights, denial of due process, and lackof equity and fair play in cases in which there are changes in circumstancesand, for various reasons, the obligor does not seek to modify the order.Several commenters objected to the prohibition of retroactive modificationof support because the requirement will cause substantial litigation dueto the denial of property and other rights and due process to obligors.<T3>Response:</T3> Federal law and regulations provide that child supportjudgments will be treated in the same manner as any other judgment in theState. A child support debtor whose circumstances change is entitled tothe same fairness and equity defenses and due process rights as other judgmentdebtors in the State. An obligor subject to the enforcement of a childsupport judgment is entitled to the same due process protection and statutoryexemptions that apply to the enforcement of other judgments within theState.We encourage States to establish expedited procedures for modificationof child support judgment orders whenever there is a substantial changein the circumstances of either party. State laws and court orders can providefor prompt, efficient modifications of support obligations when deemedappropriate. In addition, some occurrences (e.g., death or emancipationof a dependent child) might be construed under State law as triggeringautomatic prospective termination or modification of the support obligationto avoid inequitable results.11.<T3> Comment:</T3> Three commenters objected to the prohibition of retroactivemodification of support arrearages because it replaces the case-by-casereview by the judiciary which they believe is necessary to ensure fairnessand equity. For example, if the obligor loses his or her job or becomesseriously ill and lacks the funds or knowledge to pursue immediate modificationof the support order, arrearages will accrue which otherwise might havebeen avoided. Several commenters objected to the prohibition of retroactivemodification of support because it limits judges' discretion and authorityand prohibits the obligor from challenging improperly calculated arrearages.<T3>Response:</T3> Federal law and regulations will require some Statesto amend laws and to limit judicial discretion and authority regardingthe retroactive modification of support arrearages. In a relatively smallnumber of cases there may be situations where obligors fail to seek orare unable to obtain prompt modifications to which they may have been entitled.We believe, however, that this law remedies a greater inequity which previouslyoccurred in many more cases where a child support obligor, through hisor her own neglect or refusal to comply with the support order, incurredarrearages which were subsequently reduced or forgiven entirely by thecourt. In such situations the obligor's children paid the consequencesthrough no fault or responsibility of their own. We encourage States toenact laws providing expedited procedures for prompt modification of supportobligations whenever circumstances change (e.g., an obligor becomes incapacitated).In addition, the courts or administrative authority should provide guidancewhen child support orders are entered encouraging either party to notifythe court or administrative authority when circumstances change.Federal law and regulations do not prohibit the correction of improperlycalculated arrearages; the IV-D agency, judiciary or administrative authoritymay correct any improperly calculated arrearages.12.<T3> Comment:</T3> A commenter suggested that the proposed regulationsbe revised to permit retroactive reduction of support arrearages if a determinationis made that failure to pay support was not willful. The commenter indicatedthat incarcerated individuals unable to obtain prompt legal representationwould be assisted by this change. Another commenter indicated that theproposed regulations place a hardship on incarcerated individuals who are,for the most part, incapable of paying support, or securing legal counsel.In addition, several commenters suggested that the regulations be revisedto indicate that when a person is confined to jail, prison or a mentalhealth institution or treatment facility, the initial date of confinementis constructive notice that a petition to revise the support obligationduring the period of incarceration or confinement is pending. The commentersbelieve that this change is necessary because: (1) Many inmates do nothave prompt access to legal assistance or the courts; (2) the ability topay support is affected by incarceration or confinement; (3) support arrearagesthat accrue while an individual is confined or incarcerated cannot be modifiedonce an individual is released; and (4) the accumulation of support arrearageswhile an individual is confined or incarcerated may discourage an individualfrom working while incarcerated or upon release.<T3>Response:</T3> The obligor, including an incarcerated individual, isgenerally responsible for filing a request for modification of the supportorder with the appropriate court or administrative authority immediatelyupon any change in circumstances which affects the ability to pay, or needfor support. The law does not provide any exception for obligors who failedto file in a timely manner for any reason including lack of knowledge regardingthe process, prompt access to counsel, and lack of money. If the obligorcannot afford legal counsel, the obligor should seek assistance from availablepublic legal services or should contact the court or administrative authoritydirectly.The Federal Government does not prescribe State requirements for noticeof filing a petition to suspend or modify a support obligation. The State'sown procedures of due process specify exactly what notice is required inthe circumstances presented by the commenter. It would appear that Statesmight enact laws that could provide for automatic prospective suspensionof support obligations when a person is placed in a hospital or institutionand does not have the assets or unearned income necessary to meet the supportobligation if such laws applied generally to all judgment debtors in theState. Some obligors may, however, have assets or investment income whichare adequate to meet their obligations even during periods of temporaryunemployment. We believe that most modifications should be subject to approvalof the court or administrative authority, and that the obligor is usuallyin the best position to bring changes in his or her circumstances to thecourt's or administrative authority's attention. 13. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulations be revisedto indicate that prohibition of retroactive modification of support arrearagesin the 18 States that permitted such modification before the new law bea ``rebuttable presumption'' rather than an absolute prohibition. <T3>Response: </T3>Federal law does not allow exceptions to the prohibitionof retroactive modification of support arrearages for some States basedon their past practices, and we believe the proposed change to the regulationwould be improper. The prohibition applies on the same basis to all States;States may not use a ``rebuttable presumption'' standard. 14. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulations be revisedto permit the parties (obligee and obligor) to stipulate to a retroactivereduction of the child support arrearage if the obligor agrees to makean immediate lump sum payment. Several commenters suggested that the regulationsbe revised to permit retroactive modification of support arrearages byagreement of the parties. A commenter also asked whether a State law thatpermits a court approved agreement between the parties to retroactivelymodify a support order is consistent with section 9103 of Pub. Law 99-509.If not, the commenter further suggested that the regulations indicate thatthis is not permissible. Another commenter suggested that the regulationsbe revised to clarify that the prohibition of retroactive modificationof support arrearages does not provide for any judicial or parental discretion.<T3>Response: </T3>Federal law and regulations provide that child supportis a judgment on and after the date due with the full force, effect andattributes of a judgment of the State. Such support judgments may, however,be compromised or satisfied by specific agreement of the parties on thesame grounds as exist for any other judgment in the State. Judgments involvingchild support arrearages assigned to the State under titles IV-A, IV-Eand XIX of the Social Security Act, of course, may not be compromised byan agreement between the obligee and obligor unless the State, as assignee,also approves such an agreement. State law may require that any agreementaffecting child support orders must be endorsed by the court or administrativeauthority to ensure that the best interests of the child are protected.15. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether the law regarding the prohibitionof retroactive modification of support arrearages applies to a custodialparent's request to increase the amount of arrearages and future payments.The commenter further asked whether, if the new law applies to this situation,does the modification apply as of the date the obligor receives noticeof the petition. <T3>Response: </T3>Federal law and regulations permit an upward modificationof the support order and related arrearages for any period during whicha petition is pending for modification, but only from the date notice hasbeen given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligor.16. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked about the extent of IV-D agency responsibilityfor judicial compliance with the prohibition of retroactive modificationrequirements. <T3>Response: </T3>OCSE approval of a State plan amendment regarding theprohibition of retroactive modification of support arrearages requirementsis dependent upon whether the State has in effect the necessary State lawsand procedures required by the new Federal law. Judges would be requiredby State law to comply with the prohibition of retroactive modificationrequirements.Federal law requires each State to operate a Child Support Enforcementprogram throughout the State in accordance with the requirements of titleIV-D of the Social Security Act, including the prohibition of retroactivemodification of support arrearages. To ensure that a State has an effectiveChild Support Enforcement program, OCSE conducts an audit of each State'sChild Support Enforcement program, at least once every three years, todetermine whether the State is in substantial compliance with the requirementsof title IV-D of the Act. If, as the result of an audit, a determinationis made that the State did not substantially comply with the requirementsregarding the prohibition of retroactive modification of support, the Statewill be subject to a reduction of Federal funding under title IV-A of theAct. 17. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that the regulations be revisedto specify that, at the time the support obligation is established, theobligor be notified of the requirements regarding the prohibition of retroactivemodification of support arrearages. The commenter also suggested that theregulations be revised to require prison administrators to give immediatenotice to inmates regarding the prohibition of retroactive modificationof support arrearages requirements. <T3>Response:</T3> Federal law and regulations do not prohibit the Statefrom notifying the parties, at the time the support order is established,or, in the case of incarceration, at the time of incarceration, notifyingthe obligor, of the prohibition of retroactive modification of supportarrearages requirements. We believe that the States are in the best positionto determine the means, and under what circumstances, notice should beprovided. 18. <T3>Comment:</T3> A comment was received on the requirement that arrearagesmay be modified, but only from the date notice of the petition for modificationhas been given to the obligee, or where the obligee is the petitioner,to the obligor. The commenter suggested that this provision refers to thedate action is filed and notice is issued or the date the notice is issuedif the notice is not issued on the same date the petition is filed, ratherthan the date notice is received by the opposing party. The commenter'srationale was that it is consistent with general law that the court's powersare invoked and exercisable as of the date the petition is filed and noticeis sent to the other party. The commenter believes that the legislativehistory regarding the prohibition of retroactive modification of arrearagessupports this position. A second commenter suggested that the regulations be revised to permitretroactive modification of support  arrearages as of the date the noticeis filed, rather than the date of service on the obligor because most motionsto modify include requests to increase the support order and the obligorwill attempt to avoid service of process. Several other commenters alsorecommended that the regulations be revised to permit retroactive modificationof support arrearages as of the date the petition is filed. One of thesecommenters indicated that the preamble does not address why the regulationrequires the States to abandon the longstanding legal principle that ajudgment may be modified retroactively at least to the date it is filed.Another commenter suggested that the regulations be revised to indicatethat modification of support arrearages can take place during any periodin which a petition for modification is pending if the party seeking modificationof support arrearages shows diligence in providing notice to the otherparty because various tactics will be used by the obligor to avoid serviceof process. Finally, a commenter asked that we explain the meaning of the word ``given''as used in the phrase ``the date notice of the petition has been given''in the proposed regulations. <T3>Response:</T3> Federal law permits the retroactive modification ofsupport arrearages during any period in which a petition for modificationis pending, but only from the date that notice of the petition has beengiven, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee,or where the obligee is the petitioner, to the obligor. The regulatoryrequirement mirrors the Federal statutory language. We believe Congressintended that ``date of notice'' or ``date notice is given'' should beconstrued literally and in terms of acquiring personal jurisdiction overthe other party. State law provides rules to determine when personal jurisdictionis acquired by service of notice of an action. Under these provisions,the ``date of notice'' or ``date notice is given'' should be interpretedby the State in the same way as it is generally applied to commence othercivil litigation within the State. State law regarding the establishmentof the date of notice that a petition has been filed dictates when themodification may be effective. The date of notice may be the same dateon which the petition is filed if ``notice is given'' on the same dateby publication or other means and personal service is not required underState law. Although the effective date of any modification is tied to the date noticeof the petition is given, we believe notice through the mail or other meansmay be sufficient so long as the State has acquired personal jurisdictionover the other party under State law. Thus, the party named in the petitioncould not necessarily avoid the process server to delay the effective dateof any modification. However, the date of notice is subject to State dueprocess requirements. Consequently, some States may tie ``date of notice''to actual receipt of personal service if that is the standard in the Statefor securing personal jurisdiction over the opposing party in a modificationproceeding.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG>The Secretary has determined, in accordance with Executive Order 12291that this rule does not constitute a ``major'' rule for the following reasons:(1) The annual effect on the economy is less than $100 million; (2) This rule will not result in a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies,or geographic regions; and (3) This rule will not result in significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354), we are requiredto prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for those rules which willhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.For this rule, the principle impact is on State IV-D agencies who willbe required to expend minimal effort, and on the judicial system. Thisprovision could potentially save money for both the Federal Governmentand the States by increasing amounts available for collection and reducingthe costs of collecting support. Further, the cost of interstate enforcementactivities will be reduced by eliminating the need to obtain a child supportorder in more than one State. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>45 CFR Part 302Child support, Grant programs_social programs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.45 CFR Part 303Child support, Grant programs_social programs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.45 CFR Part 305Accounting, Child support, Grant programs_social programs, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="20"> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.783, ChildSupport Enforcement Program.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
