Promising to pursue every avenue to win the release of thehostages, Bush said the lives of all of them are ``too precious forme to be sticking my head in the sand.''   The president said some parties who have been ambivalent orsilent on the hostage issue are now willing to help because theyare ``so infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by a videotapepurporting to show an American hostage hanging from a rope, as wellas by a death threat against another American.   ``There is a common thread: this is too much, enough isenough,'' Bush said.   Bush was asked about his policy on dealing with hostage takersin the wake of a comment in an interview with The Boston Globe inwhich he said, ``We do not negotiate in any way that's going tojeopardize the lives of other Americans.''   The administration's policy has been that the United States willtalk with anyone but will not negotiate for the release of thehostages.   ``I don't think there's any subtle change'' from the position hetook in 1986 when he led a task force that wrote a report onterrorism, Bush said.   ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some otherAmerican, perhaps in some other place at some other time, atrisk,'' Bush said. ``And that means trading off or negotiating forhostages.''   Discussing his policy on dealing with kidnappers, particularlyon whether the United States might release billions of dollars infrozen Iranian assets, Bush said he would ``do nothing that will beseen a quid pro quo for hostages.''   Bush answered questions while posing in the Oval Office withCardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic leader of Boston. Bushcalled on Americans to say a prayer this weekend for the hostagesand their families, as well as for world peace.   The president said he wanted to be alert to any possible openingto win the hostages' release. ``I don't want to miss a signal,'' hesaid.   Bush has been described by his spokesman as cautiouslyoptimistic, but said in the Globe interview he had no reason tobelieve the hostage problem would be solved in the immediate future.   He told reporters today, ``I've never felt that the hostageswould be here tomorrow but I hope they will. I hope that somethingwill happen.''   Earlier, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, whilesaying there was no new policy, acknowledged that theadministration had come up with new language ``to give definition''to the U.S. stand.   In another development, the wife of Marine Lt. Col. WilliamHiggins said she is praying for Bush's efforts to ``save theliving'' U.S. hostages in Lebanon, acknowledging that her husbandalmost certainly is dead.   Robin Higgins, wearing her Marine Corps uniform and speaking ina calm and steady voice, acknowledged for the first time Tuesday itis a ``virtual certainty'' her husband is dead.   ``Now is not the time for anger and bitterness, forrecrimination and blame.   ``Now is the time for calm reflection. ... Now is the time totell Rich Higgins that we love him and we miss him,'' she said.   Higgins was the commander of a U.N. peacekeeping force insouthern Lebanon when he was abducted on Feb. 17, 1988.   His Shiite Moslem kidnappers released a 30-second videotape aweek ago that purported to show him dangling by a rope, bound andgagged. The terrorists said the U.S. officer was hanged inretaliation for Israel's kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aMoslem cleric.   Mrs. Higgins, a Marine major, is on leave from her job as aPentagon public affairs officer.   In her statement, she made no mention of the grisly videotapereleased by her husband's kidnappers.   The FBI says it has concluded ``within a reasonable degree ofmedical certainty'' that the person depicted in the videotape wasHiggins, but it released no information about the time or cause ofdeath.   The bureau's analysis suggests Higgins was killed in some othermanner before the videotape was made, according to anadministration official who declined to be named publicly.   Mrs. Higgins, her hands shaking slightly as she read from herprepared text, said she had been ``advised ... of the virtualcertainty that my husband ... is dead'' by the Marine commandant,Gen. Alfred Gray. She also noted she had received calls from thepresident.   ``I am also mindful of the fact that our president has agonizedin a very profound and personal manner over my husband's fate,''she said. ``He has my prayers and my support as he tries to savethe living and end the suffering.''   In her statement, Mrs. Higgins lauded her husband as a man oftolerance and dignity who served as a U.N. peacekeeper because of``a profound sense of duty.''   ``Rich went to Lebanon in the service of the United Nationsbecause he believed he could be useful, that he could help, that hewas needed,'' Mrs. Higgins said.   ``He wrote in his high school yearbook that his goal was `alwaysto make my family proud of me,''' Mrs. Higgins said. ``Hesucceeded.''</TEXT></DOC>
