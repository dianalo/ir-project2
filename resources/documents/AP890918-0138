SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the federal agency that studies theair and oceans said Monday that climatic change is likely over thenext century and that there are no quick or easy answers to theproblem.   ``We can recycle, we can conserve, we can change our lifestyle,but I believe it is unrealistic'' to expect that population andenergy use can continue to grow without adding human-inducedclimatic change to the normal variability of nature, said JohnKnauss, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   Knauss spoke at a conference on Earth Observation and GlobalChange held to discuss research efforts into the causes of theproblem and to seek solutions.   ``Do not expect easy answers and do not expect quick results. Iexpect in the next hundred years and more we will go through asignificant (human) induced climate change,'' said Knauss.   Climatic change, particularly the so-called Greenhouse warmingeffect, have attracted considerable attention in recent years.   Many scientists believe that carbon dioxide added to theatmosphere by industry and other human activities could trap heatfrom the sun and induce a catastrophic global overheating in thenext century.   Carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless gas, has increased by 25percent over the last 100 years, a change blamed on industrialprocesses that produce the chemical and on the destruction offorests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air.   Other scientists urge more study, however, wondering if increasedcloudiness or other natural factors might prevent much of the fearedwarming.   Both sides seem to agree that it is too soon to measure anyactual Greenhouse-induced warming because changes in year-to-yearweather normally vary so widely.   Leonard Fisk of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationtold the conference that his agency is launching a major ``Missionto Planet Earth'' to help answer some of the questions about globalchange.   William F. Harris of the National Science Foundation added thatthe organization also is promoting such research, and noted that thefederal Committee on Earth Science recently announced a coordinatedglobal change research effort by a dozen federal agencies.   But Knauss admonished listeners not to look for too much too fast.   He said that what concerns him even more than the threat ofchange is that many problems, such as the hole in the protectiveozone layer found over Antarctica, have come as surprises.   Greenhouse warming was first predicted three decades ago, henoted, but scientists were surprised by the ozone hole, by recentreports of increased methane in the air and by a rise in low-levelozone in rural areas.   ``My concern in this context is not so much on what their effectis on global change or the environment, which is real, but that wedid not predict them. It is not much of an exaggeration to say wealmost stumbled over them,'' said Knauss.   ``I continue to ask myself, `What is it that we're not measuringthat we should be measuring?''' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
