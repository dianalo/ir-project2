<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0827 </DOCNO><TEXT>Yuasa Battery Company has fabricated a battery composed of 280-300 Ahsubmodular cells to make the performance test in Moonlight Project underthe auspices of New Energy Development Organization. Although there wasno problem at all in the duration in discharge/charge at 8hr, energyefficiency, energy density and environmental acceptability, the dielectricstrength and energy loss in the idle time were unsatisfactory. It isnecessary to decrease the heat loss to half by improving the insulatingstructure to attain the target of 50 kW-module. Meanwhile, another 12.5kW-battery was fabricated to make the file test. The energy efficiencywas stable and the battery showed no sign of deterioration. The testresults indicate as a whole that the characteristics of the battery arepractically satisfactory compared with the target values in MoonlightProject.
