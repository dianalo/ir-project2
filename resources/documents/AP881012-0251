The 2{-hour product demonstration in San Francisco's swankLouise M. Davies Symphony Hall before 3,000 guests comes a yearafter it had been promised, prompting critics to dub thesecrecy-shrouded machine the ``Eventually.''   The computer won't immediately be available, and Next Inc. ofPalo Alto, Calif., so far has refused to say when the machine willbe on the market.   Besides its release date, the big question is the machine'sprice tag.   Next's machine is designed with the power of an engineeringworkstation, the kind that normally sells for upwards of $30,000 to$50,000. Jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less, butjust how much less is unknown.   Analysts early on speculated the machine would range from $3,000to $5,000, but estimates now range up to $7,000 to $10,000.   Jobs, who co-founded Apple Computer in 1976 in his parents'garage, has said the Next computer was initially designed forcollege students and academic researchers, although analystsbelieve he now envisions a wider market.   It's been speculated his machine will be capable of competingwith such hot-selling technical workstations as those from SunMicrosytems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Someof those companies are working on similar products that eventuallywill be sold for about $15,000.   Jonathan Seybold, a leading Los Angeles-based trade publisherwho has seen the Next, says industry critics `` ... all going tochange their minds'' after the machine's debut.   ``From a hardware and software standpoint, this is a remarkableachievement ... and will have a significant impact that will spreadwell beyond the number of computers Next will sell,'' he said in arecent interview.   Some details of the computer have leaked out, the most reliableone being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and17-inch monochrome monitor.   Dazzling Display Postscript software by Adobe Systems and othersoftware are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics _possibly offering photo-like realism _ and numerous type fonts andsizes. A laser printer also is expected to be offered, which wouldvastly improve industry reproduction quality standards.   In hardware, the Next is expected to come with an erasableoptical disk drive, which could increase current computer storageas much as 50 times, allow the storage of detailed images such asphotographs and give stereo-sound capability.   Jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32-bitMotorola 68030 chip, the industry's fastest; a connector to anindustry standard network called Ethernet that will allow Next toshare files with other types of computers; and Mathematicasoftware, of special use for sophisticated math equations.   ``This is going to be the biggest little computer in theworld,'' said Greg Stephens, an independent Santa Clara softwarespecialist.   A computer workstation is a machine about halfway between thecomputing capabilities of a personal computer and a mainframe.</TEXT></DOC>
