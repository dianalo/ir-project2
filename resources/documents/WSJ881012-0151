After a 1 1/2-year debate, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the plan, which will give investors who want to join a Merrill fund after Nov. 1 the option of paying either an initial sales charge or annual marketing and distribution fees.    The initial sales charge could be as much as 6.5% on stock funds and 4% for bond funds. The marketing and distribution fees could total 1% annually, in addition to a redemption fee of as much as 4% if investors leave the fund in the first few years.    Some fund groups currently offer one or the other of these pricing alternatives. But no group has ever given holders the choice with a particular fund.    &quot;Previously, many investors may have avoided a fund with a front-end load even though the fund's investment objectives and risk levels matched their own,&quot; says Arthur Zeikel, president of Merrill Lynch's Asset Management Inc. unit. Now, Mr. Zeikel says, &quot;investors will be able to choose from a broader range of funds to properly meet their needs.&quot;    The plan will cover 22 of Merrill's 28 stock and bond funds, half of which currently charge up-front fees. The dual pricing will enable investors to exchange shares among these 22 funds, though once investors choose a price plan, they can't switch later to another.    Merrill Lynch is the nation's second-largest vendor of mutual funds, with more than $71 billion in fund assets, and some fund specialists expect other fund groups to follow its move.    Merrill Lynch officials said the new fee structure reflects the trouble they are having attracting new investors to their funds. &quot;If we could sell old funds {with the up-front load}, we would,&quot; Mr. Zeikel said, noting that just two of Merrill's 12 stock funds had net inflows in the past several months.    The move comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of the use of marketing and distribution fees. The SEC is considering whether to curb the use of such fees, so Merrill's plan could eventually be changed.    And the novel plan, which was first made public early last month, has drawn criticism from some fund experts who say the annual distribution fees for long-term investors eventually could exceed the up-front costs.    But Merrill Lynch officials said yesterday that the National Association of Securities Dealers is considering a proposal that would create a maximum amount investors could pay over time.    Currently, a fund can charge no more than a 8.5% up-front sales fee, according to NASD rules, but there isn't any limit as to how much they can pay in annual distribution charges. </TEXT></DOC>
