L. 98-457, 42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.). Title III of these Amendments,entitled the ``Family Violence Prevention and Services Act'' (the Act),enumerates the responsibilities of the Departments of Justice and Healthand Human Services, pursuant to section 311 of the Act, ``Law EnforcementTraining and Technical Assistance Grants and Contracts.'' In order to enablethe Department of Justice to carry out these responsibilities, funds aretransferred from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the AttorneyGeneral of the United States. The overall purposes of the Act are to: assist states in efforts to preventfamily violence; provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victimsof family violence and their dependents; and provide technical assistanceand training relating to family violence programs for state and local publicagencies (including law enforcement agencies), nonprofit organizations,and other persons seeking such assistance. Section 311 of the Act provides for regionally-based training and technicalassistance to personnel of local and state law enforcement agencies toprovide them with the means for responding to incidents of family violence.The Act states that ``applications which propose projects or programs whichwill develop, demonstrate, or disseminate information with respect to improvedtechniques for responding to incidents of family violence by law enforcementofficers shall be given priority.'' This announcement applies only to section 311 of the Act. Also, for purposesof this program announcement, the term ``family violence'', as definedin section 309 of the Act, means any act or threatened act of violence,including any forceful detention of any individual, which: a. Results or threatens to result in physical injury; and b. Is committed by a person against another individual (including an elderlyperson) to whom such person is or was related by blood or marriage or withwhom such person is or was lawfully residing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Problem </ITAG>The problem of family violence has existed for generations, yet only recentlyhas it begun to receive any degree of attention. The Reagan Administrationfocused special attention on this issue with initiation of the AttorneyGeneral's Task Force on Family Violence which issued its final report inSeptember 1984. Based upon considerable research, including testimony receivedfrom public hearings held across the country, the Task Force reported thata law enforcement agency is usually the first and often the only agencycalled upon to intervene in family violence incidents. Public safety officersare in the forefront of the effort to preserve peace, even within families.But the Task Force discovered that_largely as a result of traditional communityattitudes which considered violence within the family to be a private,less serious matter than violence between strangers_calls to police involvingfamily violence are usually given a low priority. The Task Force researchalso indicated that in carrying out the community's priorities and lawenforcement agency practices, police dispatchers and emergency call operatorsmay often give the impression that a family violence call is a nuisance.Accordingly, minimal information is requested from the caller and the dispatcheror emergency call operator assigns the call a low dispatch priority. Asa result, the intervention by the patrol officer may be slow and inconsistent.The FBI has reported that nearly 20 percent of all homicides in this countryoccur among family members. To reduce this high incidence of violence andprevent these tragic consequences, it is essential that all law enforcementagencies review their existing policies and publish operational proceduresthat establish family violence as a priority response. Implementation mustbegin with the police chief or sheriff and continue down the chain of commandto the individual patrol officer. Consequently, patrol officers, and theofficers who provide training both at the academies and within the departments,should understand the need for swift and responsive law enforcement intervention,the need to respond with caution and sensitivity toward the seriousnessof the situation, the proper methods of screening and classifying familyviolence calls, and the appropriate referral and disposition of familyviolence victims and perpetrators. The Attorney General's Task Force on Family Violence made several recommendationsfor the justice system, law enforcement and education and training. Amongthe recommendations were that: 1. Family violence should be recognized and responded to as a criminalactivity. 2. Law enforcement agencies should publish operational procedures thatestablish family violence as a priority response and require officers tofile written reports on these incidents. In addition, the operational proceduresshould require officers to perform a variety of activities to assist thevictim. 3. Consistent with state law, the chief executive of every law enforcementagency should establish arrest as the preferred response in cases of familyviolence. 4. Law enforcement officials should maintain a current file of all protectionorders valid in their jurisdiction. 5. Law enforcement officers should respond without delay to calls involvingviolations of protection orders. 6. Federal, state, and local government should train relevant personnelto diagnose and appropriately intervene in family violence cases. A significant number of law enforcement agences have made marked progressin addressing the recommendations and in responding to the handling offamily violence incidents since the report was issued. Many agencies haveindicated their interest in further improving their operational proceduresand response to family violence incidents.In order to support efforts by state and local law enforcement agenciesto improve their response to family violence incidents, the Office of JusticePrograms is issuing this program announcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>In issuing this program announcement, the Office of Justice Programs, throughawarding one to three grants from funds made available under the Act, seeksto provide training on domestic violence policies and procedures to themaximum number of law enforcement executivies and mid-level managers possible.Additionally, such training will utilize a curriculum which was developedunder a previous grant made from these funds, wherein regional trainingsessions reached approximately 3% of this nation's law enforcement executivies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Description</ITAG>The selected grantees will be required to perform the following tasks:1.
