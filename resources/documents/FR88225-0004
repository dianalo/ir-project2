The amendments are matters relating toagency organization and are exempt from the notice and comment requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 553(b). Since this rule reflects current organizational changesbeing placed in effect and has no substantive effect, good cause existsto make it effective in less than 30 days after publication, under 5 U.S.C.553(d). The rulemaking merely clarifies the boundary line between the MorganCity and New Orleans Marine Inspection and Captain of the Port Zones. Therewill be no effect on the public, since Marine Safety Offices Morgan Cityand New Orleans will continue to perform all functions affecting the publicthat were previously performed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>Commander J. Kuchin, Eighth Coast Guard District Marine Safety Division,Project Manager; and Lieutenant Commander J. J. Vallone, Project Attorney,Eighth Coast Guard District Legal Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Effective 1 October 1987, the Captain of the Port Office New Orleans andMarine Inspection Office New Orleans merged resources to establish MarineSafety Office New Orleans and Marine Safety Office Morgan City. The establishmentof the boundary lines was contained in <T4>Federal Register, </T4>Vol. 52, No. 185, pg. 35913. The segment ofthe boundary line between 28anddegrees;50andmin172; N., 89anddegrees;21andmin172;06&quot;W. and the Lafourche Parish line is not accurately described. This changecorrects that by identifying coordinates in latitute and longitude. Itwill not affect any Coast Guard service to the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>This final rule is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order 12291since it pertains to matters of agency organization as provided for insection 1(a)(3) of the Order. It is considered to be nonsignificant underDOT regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).The economic impact of this final rule has been found to be so minimalthat further evaluation is unnecessary. This final rule places no requirementson any sector of the public. It will not affect Coast Guard services deliveredto the public. The rule reflects a change in internal Coast Guard organization.Since the impact of the final rule is minimal, the Coast Guard certifiesthat it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Coast guard areas, Districts, Marine inspection zones, Captain of the portzones.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, Part 3 of Title 33 of the Code of FederalRegulations, is amended as set forth below.1.
