One such program to limit Medicare programsexpenditures was the Medicare Secondary payer (MSP) provisions (42 U.S.C.1395y(b)).The purpose of this routine use is to enable HCFA and other ``entitiesresponsible for payment'' to engage in exchanges of information concerningprimary or secondary responsibility for a Medicare beneficiary's healthcare expenses. This notice is not the basis for a mandatory reporting requirementfor ``entities responsible for making payment'' as required by 42 U.S.C.1395y(b). Currently no statute mandates this type of exchange of information,therefore, these exchanges of information are strictly voluntary.The Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) is amending systems noticesfor (1) Carrier Medicare Claims Records HHS/HCFA/BOP No. 09-70-0501; (2)Health Insurance Master Record HHS/HCFA/BOP No. 09-70-0502 and (3) IntermediaryMedicare Claims Records HHS/HCFA/BPO No. 09-70-0503, to add a new routineuse. The proposed routine use will enhance our capability for identifyingMedicare Secondary payer situations where Medicare can assume a positionof reduced liability due to the presence of other entities responsiblefor making primary payment in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>The proposed new routine use shall take effectwithout further notice November 9, 1989, unless comments received on orbefore that date would warrant changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Please address comments to: Richard A.

Data in these files are used toadminister the Medicare program and for research and statistical purposes.Please note that the categories of individuals and records in the systemremain unchanged.The Privacy Act allows us to disclose information without an individual'sconsent if the information is to be used for a purpose which is compatiblewith the purposes for which the information was collected. We discloseinformation for ``routine uses'' when it is necessary to carry out ourprograms. We may also routinely disclose information to Federal, Stateor local or private agencies or individuals for purposes that are compatiblewith the purposes of our programs when the benefit of the proposed useoutweighs the effect, or risk of an effect, on the privacy of individuals.The Medicare Act at 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b) creates circumstances where theMedicare program no longer has primary liability for the medical expensesan individual incurs. It is necessary for Medicare to be able to identifythose Medicare beneficiaries who have other coverage and to demonstrateto the other involved insurer or other type of payer their primary liability.To comply with the technical requirements of the Privacy Act, HCFA is proposingto amend three systems of records by adding a new routine use to each.The affected systems of records and proposed new routine use for each systemis as follows:<ITAG tagnum="25">(1) No. 09-70-0501 (Routine use No. 24)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(2) No. 09-70-0502 (Routine use No. 16)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(3) No. 09-70-0503 (Routine use No. 22)</ITAG>To insurers, underwriters, Third Party Administrators (TPAs), self-insurers,group health plans, employers, health maintenance organizations, healthand welfare benefits funds, Federal agencies, a State or local governmentor political subdivision of either (when the organization has assumed therole of an insurer, underwriter, or TPA, or in the case of a State thatassumes the liabilities of an insolvent insurer, through a State createdinsolvent insurer pool or fund), multiple-employer trusts, no-fault, medical,automobile insurers, workers' compensation carriers or plans, liabilityinsurers, and other groups providing protection against medical expenseswho are primary payers to Medicare in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b),or any entity having knowledge of the occurrence of any event affecting(A) an individual's right to any such benefit or payment, or (B) the initialor continued right to any such benefit or payment (or example, a StateMedicaid Agency, State Worker's Compensation Board, or Department of MotorVehicles) for the purpose of coordination of benefits with the Medicareprogram and implementation of the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions at42 U.S.C. 1395y(b). The information HCFA may disclose will be:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Name</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Health Insurance Claim Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Social Security Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Sex</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary Date of Birth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Amount of Medicare Conditional Payment</ITAG>To administer the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions at 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2),(3), (4) more effectively, HCFA would receive (to the extent that it isavailable) and may disclose the following types of information from insurers,underwriters, TPAs, self-insureds, etc. concerning potentially affectedindividuals:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Subscriber Name and Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Subscriber Date of Birth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Subscriber Social Security Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Dependent Date of Birth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Dependent Social Security Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Dependent Relationship to Subscriber</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurer/Underwriter/TPA Name and Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurer/Underwriter/TPA Group Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurer/Underwriter/TPA Group Name</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Prescription Drug Coverage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Policy Number </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Effective Date of Coverage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Employer Name, Employer Identification Number (EIN) and Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Employment Status</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Amounts of Payment</ITAG>To administer the Medicare Secondary payer provision at 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(1)more effectively for entities such as Workers Compensation carriers orboards, liability insurers, no-fault and automobile medical policies orplans, HCFA would receive to the extent that it is available) and may disclosethe following information concerning potentially affected individuals.<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Benficiary's Name and Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary's Date of Birth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Beneficiary's Social Security Number*</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Name of Insured*</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurer name and Address</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Type of coverage; automobile medical, no-fault, liabilitypayment, or workers' compensation settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insured's Policy Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Effective Date of Coverage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Date of accident, injury or illness</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Amount of payment under liability, no-fault, or automobilemedical policies, plans, and workers compensation settlements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Employer Name and Address (Workers' Compensation only)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">*Name of insured could be the driver of the car, a business, the beneficiary(i.e., the name of the individual or entity which carries the insurancepolicy or plan).</ITAG>In order to receive this information the entity must agree to the followingconditions:a. To utilize the information solely for the purpose of coordination ofbenefits with the Medicare program in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b);b. to safeguard the confidentiality of the data and to prevent unauthorizedaccess to it.;c. To prohibit the use of beneficiary-specific data for purposes otherthan for the coordination of benefits between the recipient organizationand the Medicare program. The agreement would allow the entities to usethe information to determine cases where they have primary responsibilityfor payment or cases wher Medicare has primary responsibility for payment.Examples of prohibited uses would include but are not limited to: Creationof a mailing list, sale or transfer of data.The new routine use is consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7),since it is compatible with the purposes for which the information is collected.Providing these organizations with information concerning the Medicarestatus of individuals will enable the proper implementation of the MedicareSecondary Payer provisions of the Social Security Act, realize the substantialprogram savings envisioned by Congress, and will save the entities listedabove significant administrative costs in complying with Federal law.This can be accomplished with no reduction in a beneficiary's privacy.Release of this information is already a general condition of payment inthe insurance industry and the other entities will agree in writing toprotect the data from unauthorized access and use.Because the addition of this new routine use will not change the purposesfor which the information is to be used or otherwise significantly afterthe system, this action does not require a report of altered system under5 U.S.C. 552a(o). We are publishing below the affected system notices intheir entirety, with the proposed changes incorporated.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B.
