Traders attributed the market's sudden swoon tofutures-related program selling and profit-taking, reflectingan advance in stocks beyond the upper limit of their recenttrading range and a downturn in bond prices.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.26 higher at2763.06 after peaking with a gain of nearly 32 points. IBM,which soared 3 3/4 to 110 7/8, accounted for more than halfof the closing gain in the 30-stock average.   Broader market indexes posted only modest gains. Standardandamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.40 to 344.74, the New YorkStock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.14 to 188.94 and theDow Jones Equity Market Index advanced 0.38 to 321.11.   Declining stocks led advancers by about 778 to 714 on theBig Board, where the sluggish pace of trading activity lastweek in advance of the Good Friday observance continued. BigBoard volume totaled 142,810,000 shares, compared with142,470,000 Thursday.   The session was &quot;one of those days where the blue chipsare obviously leading the way,&quot; said Paul Hennessey, a vicepresident of trading at Boston Co., Boston. IBM topped thelist of most active Big Board issues by a considerablemargin; more than 4.1 million shares changed hands incomposite trading.   The Dow industrials surged about 29 points in the firsthalf-hour of trading as the market responded to IBM'sresults, which were released before trading opened. Thecompany's first-quarter net income rose 9.2%, and itsearnings per share of $1.81 for the first quarter exceededeven the most optimistic Wall Street forecast.   But the market stalled following its early rally -- inwhich the Dow industrials reached the vicinity of 2780 -- andprices drifted until the late sell-off got under way.   Program trading resulting from stock-index arbitrage,which had contributed to the market's initial gains, alsospurred its retreat, traders said. Sell programs hit themarket after index futures dropped to relatively smallpremiums to the cash indexes, making it profitable to buyfutures contracts and sell baskets of stocks.
