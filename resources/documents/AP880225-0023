After a two-hour White House meeting on Wednesday, thePortuguese leader said that because of declining U.S. assistance,he wanted consultations on the relations, as provided in a 1983cooperation agreement.   He assured Reagan that ``We do not have the intention of ceasingor reducing the facilities enjoyed by the United States inPortuguese territory.'' The goal is to ``identify and overcomeexisting difficulties,'' he said.   At issue is how much assistance the United States is providingPortugal in return for base rights, notably at Lajes Air Base _ amajor refueling point in the Azores Islands.   In the 1983 agreement, the United States promised its ``bestefforts'' to keep aid at the highest levels and granted Portugal$205 million the following year. Since then assistance hasdeclined, hitting $117 million this year.   This did not meet what Cavaco Silva called ``the legitimatePortuguese expectations,'' causing hardship for the NATO country asit tries to modernize its armed forces.   Cavaco Silva told guests at an embassy reception Wednesday nightthat the 1983 agreement permits either consultations between thetwo countries or a revision of the pact.   As of now, Portugal is asking only for the consultations, but``it may lead to a revision of the agreement,'' he said.   He said Portuguese leaders understand the U.S. need to reducethe budget deficit. The Portuguese people, however, don'tunderstnad why the United States is not paying Portugal the moneythat was promised, he said.   ``This is affecting in a negative way public opinion inPortugal,'' he said.   Reagan has asked Congress for $163 million in the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1 and officials have said chances are good therequest will be met _ given informal consultations with Congressbefore the budget was submitted.   But Reagan gave no assurances to Cavaco Silva, said a senioradministration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Asked what the consultations requested by Cavaco Silva wouldentail, the official said, ``What we are talking about today wasthe whole of this relationship, and we'll sit down and see whatmight be available in economic, science, cultural and educationalareas that would add to it.''   Reagan, who called his talks with Cavaco Silva ``cordial andcandid,'' said, ``Portugal's role as a key and trusted ally is muchappreciated here. We applaud Portugal's desire to modernize itsarmed forces, and to play a more active role in NATO's collectivedefense efforts.   ``Our commitment to assist Portugal in these efforts remainsfirm, ever within the context of the harsh budget realities that weall face.''   Under the terms of the defense pact, which expires in 1991,Portugal has the right to ask for a midterm review, the form ofwhich is not precisely spelled out.   Earlier this month, in an effort to soothe Portuguese worriesabout the aid cuts, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci went toLisbon and reached agreement with Portugal's defense chief tosubstitute surplus U.S. military equipment for some of the aid lostin the U.S. budget cutbacks.   Talks are to begin soon to identify the military needs thatmight be filled with U.S. aid.   Since Carlucci's visit, however, several Portuguese leaders havesaid the surplus equipment promise did not satisfy theirrequirements, and Cavaco Silva's comments at the White Housereflected that dissatisfaction.</TEXT></DOC>
