ARC 386s/25c SkyscraperandM;FACT FILEandM;ARC 386s/25c Skyscraper American Research Corp., 1101 Monterey Pass Rd.,andO;Monterey Park, CA 91754; (800) 423-3877 (outside Calif.), (213) 265-0835.andM;List Price: With 1MB RAM, 1.2MB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, one parallel andtwo serial ports, DOS 3.3 or 4.01, $2,182; with 4MB RAM, 150MB hard disk, VGAmonitor, $4,300; with 1.2MB 5.25-inch and 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy disk drives,Microsoft Windows 386 2.01, mouse, $4,616.andM;In Short: The Skyscraper tower's low price is offset by generallybelow-average scores on PC Labs' benchmark tests.andP;  The system has goodexpansion potential, but its design presents some minor inconvenieces.andM;American Research Corp. builds its ARC 386s/25c Skyscraper as a tower.andP;  At23.5 inches high by 6.75 inches wide by 18 inches deep, the Skyscraper isn'tmuch larger than a standard AT set on end.andP;  Yet the tower configurationoffers plenty of room for expansion--but not in the best way it could havebeen implemented.andM;While the standard configuration has a list price of $4,300, you can buy theSkyscraper nearly empty and configure it to taste.andP;  The base price of $2,182includes 1MB of RAM, one 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, one parallel and twoserial ports, and DOS 3.3 or 4.01.andP;  The $4,616 tested system included a totalof 4MB RAM, a 150MB hard disk and controller, high-density 3.5-inch and5.25-inch floppy disk drives, a VGA card and Samsung monitor, DOS 4.01,Microsoft Windows 386, and a Microsoft Mouse.andP;  The warranty includes twoyears' parts and labor on the system board and one year on everything else.andO;Warranty service is on a return-to-dealer basis, with optional on-siteservice available from Video Aid Corp.andM;Inside the Skyscraper is an ARC motherboard with the ZyMOS Poach chip set,Phoenix BIOS, 80386-25, and a coprocessor socket for an 80387, Weitek 1167,or Weitek 3167.andP;  According to ARC, you can set the socket for a 16-, 20-, or25-MHz 80387 using a jumper on the motherboard.andP;  (The tested system did nothave a coprocessor installed.)andM;All 32-bit memory in the system resides on the motherboard, with 16 SIMMsockets allowing a maximum of 16MB RAM.andP;  The SIMM sockets are located betweenthe slots and power supply, where you can reach them easily.andP;  The test unithad four 1MB SIMMs installed, using 80-nanosecond DRAM.andM;Also on the motherboard is an Austek cache controller and 32K of 25-ns.andO;static RAM cache.andP;  But despite the cache feature, the Skyscraper'sperformance was well below average on PC Labs' processor and memory tests.andO;On the other benchmark tests, the system fared a little better, with midrangeresults for the video tests, and scores on the disk tests that ranged frombelow average to better than average.andP;  The overall performance is somewhatbelow par.andM;The ARC motherboard sports two 8-bit slots and six 16-bit slots.andP;  On thereview system, three of these were filled with an ARC 16-bit VGA card, anUltrastor ESDI disk controller, and an ARC parallel/serial board.andP;  Two moreslots were taken up with the parallel port and second serial port, both ofwhich connect to the parallel/serial board by ribbon cable.andP;  The system needsa separate cutout for each port, because they all use DB-25 connectors.andP;  Thisis an avoidable waste of two slots, since the ARC tower has eight additionalDB-25 size cutouts.andP;  Alternative connectors are available on request for noextra charge; if you buy the Skyscraper, be sure to ask for them.andM;You can mount as many as five drives in the Skyscraper.andP;  The front panel hasroom for two 3.5-inch half-height and two 5.25-inch half-height devices.andO;There's also room for a hard disk inside, up to a 5.25-inch full-heightmodel, though it's hard to reach because the disk has to be mounted through acutout in the top of the chassis.andP;  You should note that the top bay isintended for one drive only, though it can handle either a half-height orfull-height drive.andP;  In the tested system, the 150MB Toshiba full-height drivewas mounted in the top bay.andM;The Skyscraper case is unusual in that it is held together with only twoscrews.andP;  The front-panel cover is held on with strong spring-loaded clips,like the hubcap on a car.andP;  To open the system, you pop the cover off, removethe two screws to release the top, slide the top off, and then lift off theside panel, which is simply hooked on the chassis.andM;This arrangement is a mixed blessing.andP;  The minimal number of screws makes iteasy to open the system.andP;  But the front-panel cover is difficult to snap backon without some pounding, much as with a hubcap.andP;  And you ought to feeluneasy about hammering on the front panel of a computer--especially if youhave some valuable data on the hard disk inside.andP;  ARC acknowledges the mostpeople will reinstall the front panel by hitting it, but adds that the casehas been available for three years without causing problems.andM;All told, the ARC 386s/25c Skyscraper is a credible system but mildly flawed.andO;There is nothing seriously wrong with it but nothing particularly enticingeither.andP;  If you can get it at a low enough price, the Skyscraper may be worthconsidering.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
