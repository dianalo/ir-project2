Indeed, some analysts believe the biggest problems in thetax-exempt market are brewing in small cities and townsscattered across California.</LP><TEXT>   David Hitchcock, an analyst at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., iswarning investors that a portion of the $3.1 billion ofso-called &quot;Mello-Roos&quot; bonds issued by California communitiescould default over the next few years. The credit ratingagency said that one such bond issue, Oceanside, Calif.'s$6.4 million William Ranch Facilities District, already is onthe brink of default and could be followed closely by manyothers.   &quot;If you have a loose structure that allows just aboutanybody to issue tax-exempt bonds, eventually you will seeabuses,&quot; said Richard Lehmann, president of the BondInvestors Association, a nonprofit organization in MiamiLakes, Fla. that tracks bond defaults. &quot;People are going tolook back at these {Mello-Roos} bonds and ask: `How did thesethings get sold in the first place.'&quot;   The bonds in question, named after their state legislativesponsors, are one of many creative types of financing thatemerged in response to California's landmark anti-taxProposition 13, which, among other things, makes it difficultfor communities in the state to issue general obligationbonds. Mello-Roos bonds have been used to build roads, sewagetreatment plants, police stations and other projects designedto improve the infrastructure of an existing community or onethat is in the early-development stages.   Most of the tax-exempt bonds are unrated by the creditrating agencies, either because the issues are too small orthe projects are considered too risky to receive aninvestment-grade rating. Generally, the bonds are notobligations of a municipality, so the financial health of theproject, real-estate development or local special district iscritical for the bonds.   Sandamp;P's Mr. Hitchcock says that many districts that issuedMello-Roos bonds have solid tax bases and are highlycreditworthy. But the criteria for issuance of Mello-Roosbonds is so flexible that they have often been used by realestate speculators following a sort of &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;approach, that is: &quot;If we build it, they will come.&quot; As longas California's economy was growing, new communities didspring up and the homeowners -- and that means taxpayers --did come.   However, declining California property values, an economicrecession that made home buyers skittish and a rise in thenumber of &quot;no growth&quot; voter initiatives have sapped thestrength of California's once go-go real estate market.Unable to attract sufficient numbers of taxpayers, some ofthe more speculative Mello-Roos projects are having troublemeeting debt payments.   Sound familiar? Many bond analysts compare the situationunfolding in California to the one that has hurt manyinvestors holding Colorado municipal bonds in the past fewyears. More than $500 million of Colorado municipals havegone sour since that state's economy went bust several yearsago. Analysts expect real estate-linked municipal bonddefaults to hit $1 billion in Colorado over the next year ortwo.   Historically, the municipal bond market has enjoyed verylow levels of default and therefore is generally viewed as asafe place in which to invest. But some analyts worry thattoo many states are allowing municipalities to issuespeculative-grade bonds, the riskiest of which are tied toreal estate and economic development projects. Sandamp;P notes thatseveral states have recently come up with their own versionsof Mello-Roos.   Mr. Lehmann of the Bond Investors Association warnedinvestors last year that California could be the nextColorado. Now, Sandamp;P is making the same comparison. AlthoughSandamp;P does not expect defaults in California to reach Coloradolevels, Mr. Hitchcock says in today's issue of Sandamp;P'sCreditWeek Municipal publication that &quot;there are a number oftroubling points about the current situation in Californiathat bear watching.&quot;   Of course, if California's housing market comes barrellingback, and the number of no-growth initiatives slows, thecreditworthiness of the bonds may improve.   But Sandamp;P is somewhat skeptical that this will happen. Therating agency notes, for example, that construction of newhousing units in California fell 7% in 1989, 31% in 1990 andis projected by the California Construction Industry ResearchBoard to fall another 30% this year, before perhapsrebounding in 1992. Construction is down because sales of newhomes has stalled.   Meanwhile, California's state government -- scrambling toclose huge budget deficits in the face of dwindling taxrevenue -- is busy raising taxes and shifting the cost ofcertain social service programs to cities and counties. It iswidely expected that the state, which currently is ratedtriple-A, will be downgraded next year.   Despite this downbeat outlook, MelloRoos bonds have somesupporters. The Franklin Group of mutual funds, the largestsingle buyer of Mello-Roos bonds, believes some analysts areexaggerating California's problems and don't fully appreciatethe state's strengths. Thomas Kenny, Franklin's director ofmunicipal research, said the firm's funds have cut back onpurchases of Mello-Roos bonds &quot;considerably&quot; this year.Franklin nevertheless believes that most of the bonds aresound and that comparisons with Colorado are a stretch, hesays.   &quot;There is a potential for some defaults, but overall tosay that California will be another Colorado is verymisleading,&quot; Mr. Kenny said. Among other things, he notedthat while Colorado has always been viewed as a boom-or-buststate that is heavily dependent on a few industries,California's economy is diverse. And while the economicdownturn in California has been more severe than many hadexpected, Mr. Kenny said that California remains afast-growing state with a steady influx of new residents inneed of housing.   That may be, but statistics show that California's rapidpopulation growth increasingly involves people whose incomesare too low to buy homes.   In fact, Sandamp;P believes that California's high housing costsare partly responsible for the state's declining home sales.The U.S. affordability index estimates that 49% of U.S.households could afford to buy the U.S. median-priced home of$103,000 in July. At the same time, only 19% of Los AngelesCounty households could buy the median-priced home of$220,000 there, compared with 22% in Orange County, 21% inSan Diego, 19% in Ventura County, 14% in San Francisco and36% in Sacramento.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices ended mixed with short-term notes postinggains while long-term bonds faded in sympathy with a lateselloff in the futures market in Chicago.   Bond prices had been higher for most of the day, lifted bymore disheartening news about the U.S. economy. The LaborDepartment reported that nonfarm payrolls declined by 1,000in October after rising by 48,000 in September. The Septemberincrease was originally reported as 24,000. Other pieces ofthe report, such as the average workweek and average hourlyearnings, also signaled economic weakness. The report wouldappear to give the Federal Reserve plenty of room to lowershort-term interest rates without igniting inflationaryexpectations.   There was no news to account for the late decline inprices of long-term bonds. But traders and analysts said thattrepidation ahead of this week's $38 billion Treasuryquarterly refunding and reports that Japanese investorscontinue to sell zero-coupon bonds exerted downward pressureon long-term bond prices.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of102 2/32, compared with 102 10/32 on Thursday. The declinetranslates into a loss of 1/4 point, or $2.50 for a bond witha $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, rose to 7.93% from 7.91% onThursday.   Meanwhile, the latest two-year Treasury notes advanced toa price of 100 21/32 to yield 5.63%, compared with a price of100 17/32 to yield 5.70% Thursday.   In when-issued trading, the $12 billion of new 30-yearTreasury bonds to be sold Thursday were quoted at a yield of7.90%. The $12 billion of 10-year bonds to be auctionedWednesday were quoted Friday at 7.45%, while the yield on thethree-year notes to be sold tomorrow were quoted late at5.95%.   In the municipal bond market, more than $2.8 billion ofdebt is scheduled to be priced this week. On the competitivecalendar, where investment banks bid against each other forissues, offerings include $321 million of Pennsylvaniageneral obligation bonds, $76 million of Clark County, Nev.,gneeral obligation bonds and $60 million of Orange County,Fla., School District tax anticipation notes. Negotiatedofferings include $622 million of Houston, Tex., water andsewer revenue bonds, $192 million of Hawaii generalobligation bonds, and $189 million of electric revenue bondsfrom the Piedmont Municipal Power Agency in South Carolina.   In addition, the California Public Works Board plans tosell approximately $50 million of College Savings Bonds,which are zero-coupon bonds. Zero-coupon bonds are sold at adeep discount to their par value and pay no interest untilmaturity.</TEXT></DOC>
