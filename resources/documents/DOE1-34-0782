The CASP (Canadian Atlantic Storms Program) wasan intensive observation program aimed at studying the evolution of winterstorms that affect the Canadian Atlantic provinces related and offshoreareas. A large amount of meteorological and oceanographical data wascollected during the CASP field project (15 January - 15 March 1986)over the Scotian Shelf and the Grand Banks area. In conjunction withthe data collection program, two spectral wave models (the ODGP, OceanData Gathering Program model, and the WAVAD model) were tested in anoperational mode during the CASP field project; both of these wave modelswere driven by winds obtainable from the operational weather predictionmodel at the Canadian Meteorological Centre in Montreal. The wave products(analyzed as well as forecast) from these two models were evaluated againstwind and wave data collected during the CASP field project. In addition,wind and wave products from the U.S. Navy's Global Spectral Ocean WaveModel were accessed and were also included in the intercomparison study.Some preliminary results of this intercomparison study are presented.5 refs., 2 tabs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
