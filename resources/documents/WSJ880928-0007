Foreign investors have bought billions of dollars of U.S. securities and property. The nation has gone from being the world's largest creditor to its largest debtor.    One might therefore expect the 1988 presidential candidates to be protectionists, promising to freeze out foreign competitors.    Not so. Both Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis are men of the traditional center on trade and international economics. Not surprisingly, their campaigns are emphasizing differences: Democrats portray Mr. Bush as weak in enforcing trade laws. Republicans charge that Mr. Dukakis leans toward union-endorsed protectionism.    In reality, however, both are &quot;fundamentally, deeply, abidingly free traders,&quot; says Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, a Dukakis campaign adviser. Both say they would be tough in battling specific overseas trade barriers, but both strongly disapprove of a broad protectionist approach to reduce the trade deficit, which, though below last year's, is likely to top $130 billion this year.    But each man may have a problem.    Mr. Bush's problem may be the Reagan administration's inconsistent trade record. In its first term, the administration was reluctant, on ideological grounds, to curb the dollar's surge or bring unfair-trade cases against foreign companies. The policy changed after James Baker became the Treasury secretary in 1985; the U.S. devalued the dollar and brought a flurry of trade cases. Robert Zoellick, the Bush campaign's issues director, says Mr. Bush would stick with the post-1985 approach.    Mr. Dukakis's problem may be the protectionist pressures from his own party, which will surely control Congress. The congressional Democrats, in fact, will have a lot to say about what either man could achieve in office.    On other troublesome international economic issues, the two men differ significantly -- and face irksome questions. They disagree on how to handle the Third World debt. In fact, the presidential campaign has become an extension of a long-running, occasionally heated debate over two competing debt-relief plans, one proposed by Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and the other by Mr. Baker, now the Bush campaign chairman.    Mr. Dukakis backs the Bradley plan. It calls for the U.S. government to convene conferences at which debtor nations and banks swap market-oriented economic reforms for progressive reductions in loan principal and interest payments.    Mr. Bush backs the Baker plan, which stresses new lending rather than debt relief. It calls for gradual, voluntary, case-by-case negotiations to trade market-oriented economic reforms in debtor countries for new loans from banks and international lending agencies.    Although both candidates embrace the new dollar-stabilizing process devised by the seven major economic powers -- the so-called Group of Seven, or G-7 -- questions remain about just what twist each might bring to the process. At least one prominent Bush adviser argues for getting governments out of the process, and at least one prominent Dukakis adviser has suggested that the Group of Seven, while keeping its hand in, might need to guide the dollar lower until the trade deficit is erased.    At the moment, though, campaign charges and countercharges on international economics are designed mostly to suggest a deep split over trade. Mr. Bush is attacking Mr. Dukakis's new campaign theme of &quot;economic patriotism,&quot; calling it in California recently &quot;nothing but a code word for protectionism.&quot;    Says Mr. Zoellick, the Bush adviser: &quot;A number of Democratic constituencies, especially the labor unions, want protectionism. We see this economic patriotism theme as a sign that Dukakis is moving their way.&quot; He acknowledges that some key Bush constituencies -- some businesses and some GOP congressmen -- also have leaned toward protectionism when their interests are at stake, but he argues that &quot;labor unions want protectionism more.&quot;    But AFL-CIO officials say Mr. Dukakis didn't make any protectionist promises to win the labor federation's endorsement. And Dukakis supporters contend that economic patriotism means only that Mr. Dukakis will be tougher than Mr. Bush in using existing trade laws. They charge that Mr. Bush acquiesced during the first Reagan term when the administration allowed the dollar to rise, trade complaints to languish and the trade gap to widen. They note that after the vice president was assigned to work on Japanese relations in 1983, the gap continued to worsen.    &quot;I would expect Dukakis, instinctively and by experience, to be a much better negotiator than Reagan or Bush,&quot; says Thomas Donahue, the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer. &quot;Bush has been in office for the last eight years, and we've had a tremendous explosion in the trade deficit.&quot;    In fact, after primary campaigns in which pummeling trade rivals and promising barriers to imports once seemed likely to turn into a compelling political theme, the parties nominated two men who made a mark by openly opposing more-protectionist candidates.    &quot;I would assume that both will use the unfair trade provisions in the new trade law vigorously because there's broad bipartisan support for that,&quot; says U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, a Bush supporter. &quot;But neither is personally a protectionist.&quot;    Though both candidates bemoan the trade deficit, neither proposes a very detailed plan for attacking it. Instead, they essentially propose gradualist approaches, in which the U.S. trims the debt over a period of years. Both favor a bilateral pact with Mexico and push &quot;competitiveness&quot; programs rather than radical changes in trade policy as the long-run solution.    On the campaign stump, Mr. Dukakis has stressed again and again that the trade deficit has broad economic causes and solutions. &quot;Unfair trading practices are only a partial cause of our overall trade deficit,&quot; he declares. &quot;In fact, if every barrier to American goods abroad disappeared tomorrow, we would still have a trade deficit of $125 billion.&quot;    Instead, Mr. Dukakis blames the Reagan administration's economic policies. Borrowing to finance budget deficits drove up the dollar, raising the cost of American exports as much as 40% and driving down import prices, he asserts.    The Democrat offers a five-part program. He proposes to reduce the budget deficit; to finance long-range programs, such as better job training and more subsidized technology research, to enhance American industrial competitiveness; to push hard for conclusion of a new trade treaty now being negotiated in Geneva at the so-called Uruguay Round; to use the new trade law to knock down foreign barriers to U.S. exports, with a threat of retaliation; and to offer certain industries protection from imports, but only if they launch a government-approved plan to become competitive in world markets.    Lately, as he has lagged in the polls, Mr. Dukakis has weaved in his economic patriotism theme, which calls for a national drive to ensure that no country will &quot;outsell or outcompete&quot; the U.S.    Mr. Bush, in contrast, argues that the trade deficit is already being wiped out. &quot;America's exports are booming,&quot; he declares. &quot;The trade gap has dropped at a rate of $40 billion over the last year.&quot;    He agrees that much of the trade problem has been due to the &quot;overvalued&quot; dollar of recent years -- though he doesn't blame that on the Reagan administration but rather leaves its cause undefined.    The core of the Bush trade program, like that of his rival, is to get federal deficits under control and improve competitiveness. He would expand education programs, cut the capital-gains tax and extend the tax credit for research and development to generate investment.    Mr. Bush also pledges to complete the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Last January, he pledged to pursue a bilateral trade pact with Japan -- opening one rift with Mr. Dukakis. Christopher Edley, Mr. Dukakis's issues adviser, says the U.S. has so many trade difficulties with Japan that a bilateral pact is &quot;a pipe dream.&quot;    Though Mr. Bush has attacked Mr. Dukakis's &quot;economic patriotism&quot; as protectionist, he has toughened his own rhetoric. He recently leaped to the support of American rice farmers demanding a White House drive to open the Japanese rice market to imports, even though negotiators doubt that that tactic would work.    Both candidates say they would continue the close coordination used by the U.S. and the other Group of Seven industrialized nations -- Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan -- to stabilize the dollar, but whether they fully support the group's current approach isn't clear. That approach establishes a secret range for the dollar's value, then enforces it by pursuing economic policies that make it seem reasonable and by buying and selling dollars in the market.    For Mr. Bush, supporting the G-7 approach comes easily because Mr. Baker, his campaign manager, fathered much of it. But one of his economic advisers, Martin Feldstein, has campaigned against the dollar-stabilization plan, arguing that the dollar has to fall much further than the group favors. Mr. Baker -- no fan of Mr. Feldstein -- insists that the economist doesn't speak for the Bush team and that Mr. Bush supports the current process.    Mr. Bush's own comments are slightly fuzzier. After a recent meeting of economic advisers, he declared himself &quot;in support of what Jimmy Baker is trying to do.&quot; But he seemed momentarily to back off when he added: &quot;I do not favor pegging the dollar to international currencies in some rigid formula.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis, by nature, favors international coordination and has said he would continue it. However, there are signs that a Dukakis administration might rethink the G-7's current dollar strategy. The candidate has spoken favorably in principle of formalizing the system someday to keep the dollar within declared &quot;target zones,&quot; but he suggests it may be premature until the trade imbalances between the U.S. and other big countries are wiped out. The implication is that Mr. Dukakis, for now, would keep the informal process of managing exchange rates as it is but would favor trying to stabilize the dollar at a lower rate than the G-7 has sought, until the trade gap is closed.    The debate last Sunday revealed sharper disagreement between the candidates on how to resolve the Third World debt crisis, especially in Latin America. Mr. Dukakis argued for a more activist approach by the government, saying that &quot;we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt&quot; which could &quot;destroy their economies, destroy their future and . . . destroy markets that are important to our firms.&quot; So he endorses the Bradley plan, under which banks would have to carry the costs of debt relief, while the government would adjust banking and accounting rules so the write-downs wouldn't drive them under.    &quot;I think the banks are going to have to take some losses,&quot; Mr. Dukakis says in an interview, noting that many large banks have already increased loss reserves. &quot;I don't think the public treasury ought to bail them out.&quot;    In the debate, Mr. Bush reiterated his support for the Baker plan, asserting: &quot;I want to see free-market economies spring up all around the world.&quot; He sees the problem largely in commercial and financial terms and believes that the solution involves new lending by private banks and organizations such as the World Bank.    Richard Darman, a Bush campaign adviser and Mr. Baker's former deputy at Treasury, contends that the Bradley plan can't work without an infusion of public money. And he says turmoil is more likely if debtor nations see Mr. Dukakis elected and expect quick implementation of the Bradley plan. In that case, debtors &quot;most certainly will try to precipitate an early crisis and make enormous demands for debt relief.&quot;    But Sen. Bradley predicts that the debt crisis will boil over early next year unless the new president moves swiftly to start resolving it. If the Republicans win, he charges, Mr. Bush &quot;will pretend there's no problem until the night before Mexico or Brazil is about to precipitate a world financial crisis.&quot; The result, he contends, would be that debt relief will be forced on the U.S. anyway, and American leadership, democratic influence and capitalism will be eroded in Latin America.    ---             Bush and Dukakis on International Economics            Areas of Agreement: Both candidates support   -- A lower budget deficit and improved U.S. industrial competitiveness as the best way to reduce the trade deficit.   -- Continued stabilization of the dollar.   -- Current negotiations to liberalize world trading rules.                        Areas of Disagreement   Japan: Bush supports a bilateral trade pact with Japan; Dukakis doesn't.   Third World Debt: Dukakis supports the Bradley debt-relief plan; Bush backs the Baker plan calling for new lending rather than debt relief.</TEXT></DOC>
