While emphasizing that President Reagan has made no finaldecision, the official said the administration is concerned thatcontinuing the prohibition actually could end up benefiting Libyanstrongman Moammar Gadhafi.   The official discussed the administration's thinking on groundsthat he not be named publicly.   Since mid-1986, several U.S. oil companies have been barred fromdoing business directly in Libya, but they have kept their assets,including equipment, there under an agreement in which Gadhafirecognized the firms' 49 percent share in the state-owned oilcompany. The agreement froze the assets of five American companies _Amerada Hess, Marathon Oil, W.R. Grace, Occidental Petroleum andConcoco Petroleum.   Under that pact, Libya has extracted oil from the American oilfields, paying the costs of such operations while also reaping theprofits.   But the agreement with Gadhafi expires on June 30, and somepeople in the administration have voiced concern that if the U.S.government continues its ban on the American firms doing businessthere, Gadhafi might seize the assets, thus benefiting from the ban.   The restrictions on the operations of the U.S. oil firms wereseparate from the broad economic sanctions that Reagan placed onLibya in February 1986. In April of that year, U.S. warplanes bombedTripoli in reprisal for Libya's alleged role in a terrorist bombingincident that took the life of an American soldier at a West Berlindiscotheque.   There have been new tensions between the United States and Libyain connection with the construction of a facility that the Americansmaintain is designed to manufacture chemical weapons. Earlier thismonth, American F-16 fighter jets shot down two Libyan aircraft overthe Mediterranean Gulf.   ``It's a `Catch-22' here,'' the administration official saidtoday in a telephone interview. ``If things remain the same(concerning the status of U.S. oil firms), they could benefitGadhafi.''   This official said that if the sanctions against operations inLibya by U.S. oil companies remain, ``it could result in a windfallfor Gadhafi.''   ``No decisions have been made, but there has been discussion''about easing the sanctions, he said. ``There are some problems withthese sanctions. ... Any changes that might be made would not bedone to ease (overall) sanctions on Libya. ... I can guarantee youthat.''   A lifting of the restrictions by Reagan, who will leave officeFriday, could permit the companies to resume doing business inLibya, perhaps through subsidiaries, or to sell their assets beforethe agreement with Gadhafi expires.   The New York Times reported in today's editions that Reagan wasexpected this week to lift some prohibitions on U.S. oil companiesdoing business in Libya to prevent them from losing their assetsthere.</TEXT></DOC>
