Arrests numbered in the triple digits in Philadelphia andAlbany, N.Y., as demonstrators chanted, prayed, picketed andblocked entrances at women's clinics Friday. Long Beach, Calif.,Syracuse, N.Y., Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, and St. Paul, Minn.,had more peaceful protests.   Binghamton, N.Y.-based Operation Rescue has organized periodicdemonstrations of civil disobedience to publicize its stanceagainst abortion, and Holy Week has been a traditional time foranti-abortion protests. Abortion rights groups used the anticipateddemonstrations to organize counterprotests in several cities.   In Long Beach, site of the largest demonstration, about 350abortion foes blocked doorways at a downtown medical office as some300 abortion rights advocates chanted, ``Read 'em their rights andtake them away.''   However, Police Chief Lawrence Binkley refused to make arrests,saying the building was closed.   It was not immediately clear whether the protesters, who hadarrived about 6:30 a.m., had kept the office from opening orwhether the facility was scheduled to be closed Friday.   Operation Rescue's leader, Randall Terry, arrived on the sceneas the protest was well under way and declared, ``What a riot.'' Herepeated his claim that the news media is ``hiding the truth fromthe American public.''   One anti-abortion activist was charged with misdemeanor batteryfor allegedly throwing himself onto three pro-choice activistssitting on the ground in front of another clinic, said Sgt. BillSnow.   About 1:45 p.m., a man called the administrative offices ofPlanned Parenthood and ``said there's a bomb in the building andit's going to blow up any minute,'' said Stephanie Alexander,director of clinical programs.   About 30 people evacuated the building but police found no bomband the workers returned an hour later, said Dr. Joan Babbott,executive director.   A day earlier 373 protesters had been hauled off by police inthe Los Angeles suburb of Cypress.   In Philadelphia, 400 to 500 demonstrators on both sides of theabortion issue gathered in rain and gusting winds outside twodowntown clinics a block apart. About 180 people _ more than fourbusloads _ were carted off by police for blocking entrances at thePlanned Parenthood clinic and the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Centerfor Women.   Marcy McCook, a worker at Planned Parenthood, said abortionrights advocates were staging a counterdemonstration because``people are afraid they're going to lose their rights.''   In Albany, some 200 protesters carried banners and signs thatread, ``Abortion, The Ultimate Child Abuse,'' ``Baby HumansSlaughtered Here'' and ``Hitler Would be Proud of PlannedParenthood,'' shortly after dawn at the downtown office of UpperHudson Planned Parenthood.   About 115 protesters were arrested for blocking the clinic'sdoors or standing on clinic property. They went limp, forcingpolice to drag them into waiting vans and a converted passenger bus.   ``We're trying to save babies,'' said Bishop Austin Vaughan ofthe New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese, as he was carted away. Hesaid he'd been arrested five times before at similar protests.   The demonstrators refused to say whether they were part ofOperation Rescue, but some sported ``O.R.'' armbands and OperationRescue sweatshirts. By afternoon, a pro-choice advocates had beguna counterdemonstration across the street.   In Syracuse, police used wheelchairs to haul away as many as 50protesters who entered the Planned Parenthood Center while about100 others picketed outside in a cold drizzle.   ``They barged in and shoved at least one staff worker aside,''said Jim Dessauer, the clinic's community relations director. ``Idon't think they pushed any patients, but they certainly verballyharangued and harassed them.''   In St. Paul, Minn., about 150 anti-abortion protesters, somecarrying large crosses, chanted and prayed outside St. Paul-RamseyMedical Center in their traditional Good Friday protest. Policereported no arrests.   About three dozen protesters from Cincinnati blocked doors atthe Dayton Women's Health Center in suburban Kettering. About 30were handcuffed and put onto a police bus as the few remainingdemonstrators cheered.   Mary Keck, a protester, said the group came to Dayton becauseCincinnati police were waiting for them. Earlier, in Cincinnati, 30to 35 demonstrators picketed two women's clinics but no on wasarrested.</TEXT></DOC>
