 Today, with the aid of graphic displays,computer-aided typography, and windowing technology (e.g., compare the facingpage with the cover of this issue) we have returned to this desirablesituation.andP;  We have corrected the technology-driven separation forced upon usfor centuries by conventional practices of mechanical printing and dataencoding.andP;  Now computer support of human interaction with multimediainformation is rapidly accelerating, as evidenced by the phenomenal growth inuse of digital technology for audio processing and the remarkable advances incomputer graphics.andM;This issue of Communications will help prepare us for the next giant step inthe sensory evolution of human-computer interaction, where digitalmanipulation of full-motion video can also become a standard capability ofworkstations and personal computers.andP;  The focus of the eight articles in thisspecial issue is thus on some of the exciting developments in computerscience that make possible the storage and real-time interactive use ofdigitally encoded video.andP;  The authors discuss algorithms, artificialintelligence, audio, graphics, information retrieval, parallel processing,software engineering, standards, and storage technology.andP;  The perspectivesrepresented include theoretical analysis, design, prototyping,implementation, and abstraction from completed applications.andM;An underlying theme of this issue is the potential impact of affordableinteractive digital video.andP;  From video conferencing to video telephony, fromgames to simulations, from information access to instruction, from realism tosynthetic video, from 2-D to 3-D effects, from video windowing on monitors tovideo editing, there are diverse classes of applications.andP;  Image processingtechniques can enhance individual frames (e.g., for North American TV, 30still frames are shown each second), and novel approaches to handling motionsequences are possible.andP;  Exciting new blends of graphics, animations, audio,and video are emerging, with computer and human control shares to effect anincredibly high bandwidth multisensory symbiosis.andM;To better understand the promise and challenge relating to interactivepreparation and use of digitally encoded video, however, it will be useful tobecome acquainted with several of the many related developments.andP;  Inparticular, it is crucial, in light of the enormous space normally requiredto store collections of high quality color images, to review some of the mostimportant recent advances in optical storage technology.andM;STORAGE TECHNOLOGYandM;In his 1984 CACM article, &quot;Laser optical disk: The coming revolution inon-line storage,&quot; Fujitani correctly foresaw the importance of the revolutionthat optical storage technology has enabled, and alerted us to some of thepossibilities.andP;  This becomes clear when we consider several key developments,and how they relate to multimedia information storage.andM;* In the 1970s, laser videodiscs as they are now known were first produced,with 54,000 analog video frames (e.g., 30 minutes of motion video) pressedonto each side of a 12-inch platter.andM;* In 1982, CD-DA, (compact disc-digital audio) was launched, adaptingvideodisc technology for storing up to 72 minutes of high quality digitallyencoded audio on a 12-centimeter mass produced compact disk.andM;* In 1984, the first prototype CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory) driveswere demonstrated, allowing personal computers to access over 600 megabytesof pre-recorded digital data that could represent any computer readableinformation, including text, pictures, structural databases, and speciallyencoded data in a wide variety of forms.andM;* Also in 1984, writable optical disks, often called WORMs (write once readmany), became commercially available, with 12-inch platters used forarchiving a gigabyte or mor of digital multimedia information.andM;* In 1986, it was announced that CD-I (compact disk-interactive)specifications would be submitted, so that CD-I players could be developedfor the consumer market that would handle compact disks with video, images,graphics, audio, text, data--as well as software to support interactive use.andM;* In 1987, a David Sarnoff Research Center team first publicly demonstratedDVI (digital video interactive) technology, wherein 72 minutes of highlycompressed full motion video and FM quality audio could be decompressed inreal time using special boards in an IBM PC/AT with attached CD-ROM drive.andM;* In 1988, erasable optical disks became commercially available, storinghundreds of megabytes on stable removable media, so that large volumes ofdigital multimedia can be economically manipulated and readily distributed(in limited quantities).andM;* Also in 1988, and ISO (International Organization for Standardization)standard specifying the volume and file organization of CD-ROMs was approved,allowing inexpensive worldwide publication and distribution of multimediadata that is directly accessible across a wide range of hardware andoperating systems.andM;While the first class of disks mentioned above used analog technology tostore images, all of the other developments mentioned involve all-digitaldata.andP;  Indeed, though videodiscs can also store limited amounts of audio,data, and programs, and can provide high quality images in commonly availableformats for analog color television monitors, their use has generally beenconcentrated on either training or archival storage and access.andP;  Digitalencoding, on the other hand, has a variety of advantages, including thepromise of allowing simpler delivery systems (with a single monitor handlingdigital text, graphics, images, video, and audio--all played back from asingle optical disk) and of fine control of the contents and of each frame.andM;INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIAandM;Once storage problems are resolved, it is the interactive component ofmultimedia systems that presents the most exciting challenges.andP;  Thus, it iscommonplace for videodisc preparation to involve use of some type ofauthoring system, where software tools and an environment are set up to allowan individual or team of developers to focus on content specification andother high level tasks.andP;  With digital video, we may move toward a moreegalitarian situation where authors and users all have control over the finalcreation, much as is hoped for with hypertext and hypermedia systems.andO;Ideally, then, concerns relating to the authors and users should be viewed asparamount.andM;Interactive systems will generally be successful only if the human-computerinterface is carefully developed according to principles of graphic designand cognitive psychology, and is thoroughly tested.andP;  If cognitive concernsare to be emphasized, an understanding of users and their needs is essential.andO;One of the most effective approaches is to model users, a tactic best adaptedfrom the area of intelligent tutoring systems.andP;  If computer systems candevelop accurate models of user knowledge, including goals and plans as wellas facts, multimedia information might then dramatically improve thebandwidth and effectiveness of instruction.andP;  A fascinating possibility existsfor computer science education, where interactive access to algorithmanimations will bring to life important concepts and processes.andP;  Another areaof increasing interest is the integration of graphics processing, especiallywindowing, with text, leading to hypertext, as considered in the July 1988Communications.andM;PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS WITH DIGITAL VIDEOandM;Investigations and debates over new higher quality television schemes havenow captured public attention.andP;  Television studio equipment includes avariety of digital units, and digital aids for editing and special effectsare commonplace.andP;  Some computer workstations now support very high resolutioncolor displays that are much better than TVs, and allow image enhancement aswell as video windows.andP;  The key problem for digital motion video, however, isthat each color image, especially when recorded with very high resolution,requires an enormous amount of storage space.andP;  That space not only consumesvaluable disk capacity (an entire CD-ROM would normally be required to handle30 seconds of directly stored motion video) but also places severe demands oncomputer and I/O bandwidth (it would normally take over an hour to play backthe 30 seconds of video from the CD-ROM).andM;The solution is to use compression.andP;  Indeed, the DVI approach mentioned aboveis one example of how compression along with real-time decompression from aPC with CD-ROM can be effective.andP;  While some digital video applications maysimply require a video window, others may be even more taxing, requiringreal-time compression, possibly with real-time decompression, thus involving,different hardware, algorithms, and storage units.andP;  Furthermore, manyadditional difficult technical problems still remain: reducing the cost ofcompression, reducing the amount of hardware and special software required,improving the quality of individual images, and ensuring smooth motionsequences.andM;Quite important, too, is the question of finding suitable applications fordigital video--where does video in general, and digital video in particular,add real value beyond the costs and complexity that now result?andP;  Finally,there is the problem of first specifying, then developing, and finally using,authoring tools and eventually an authoring environment, where multimediainteractivity is at the heart of any application development effort and ofany use of products of that environment.andP;  Some of the most importantchallenges include the following:andM;* Efficient tools and environments for authoring and editing of interactivemultimedia programs must be developed.andM;* Meanwhile, team efforts, with growing involvement by all levels ofeducators, must commence, using existing tools (so that a dramatic boost inmotivation and student participation in learning will result).andM;* Standards must emerge in a timely fashion, whether de facto or byconsensus, to encourage investment of time and resources by developers andusers.andM;* Theories and models must develop for interactive digital multimedia systemsand applications, that will be based upon relevant insights from a variety ofcomputing areas as well as related disciplines.andM;We are fortunate to have a series of papers to help with further explorationof these issues.andM;IN THIS ISSUEandM;The first article in this special issue, by Mackay and Davenport, deals withinteractivity.andP;  While focusing on video editing, they bridge the gap fromwhat many have undertaken, caught glimpses of, or at least thought of, in thecontext of editing videotapes or films and what is now a wide-open fieldessential for future TV productions and multimedia authoring systems.andO;Drawing in part upon experiences at MIT, in the Media Lab and at ProjectAthena, they abstract the research questions relating to editing ofinteractive programs by both users and authors, and give insights into thepotential for digital video, where interaction ties into direct access tovideo frames or sequences.andM;The second article, by Ripley, deals with interactive systems that canaccommodate digital video.andP;  Though this and the later articles of Dixon andTinker are all written from a background of involvement in DVI (digital videointeractive), they should be viewed as telling a more general story.andP;  Thus,Ripley considers the broad problem of digital multimedia, first describing anarchitecture that allows integration of graphics with video, and thenconsidering a variety of application areas.andM;Dixon continues with the theme of applications launched by Ripley, but from adifferent tact.andP;  His work involved devising ways to demonstrate the benefitsof interactive digital video.andP;  As such, the third article of the issue can beviewed on the one hand as a fascinating history of rapid prototyping efforts,and on the other hand as research into and feasibility testing of novel ideasfor using digital video.andM;Stevens' article, then, is particularly appropriate as a sequel, since hemakes use of DVI tools for a real application where digital video has anumber of advantages over competing solutions.andP;  Stevens also demonstrates theneed to apply concepts from other computing fields to carry out his chosentask: developing an intelligent tutoring system for training softwareengineers.andP;  He uses hypertext and hypermedia, simulation, a pseudo-naturallanguage interface, and expert systems techniques--as well as digital video.andM;The fifth paper, by Tinker, recounts more of the story initiated by Ripley,describing in some detail their approach to digital motion video compression.andO;This involves asymmetric processing, where a great deal of time and computingis applied to compression so that decompression can be carried out inreal-time.andP;  Tinker explores the use of parallel processors for this task, andconsiders methods to efficiently schedule a sequence of compression jobs on alarge compression engine.andM;Lippman and Butera, in the sixth paper, provide an excellent introduction tothe problem of motion video compression, and then proceed to describe asolution that builds upon studies of human vision and image processing.andO;Later sections go into a fair amount of detail regarding subband coding andvector quantization, as well as various extensions.andM;The article by Yu et al., serves to illustrate some of the complexityinvolved in CD-I (compact disk-interactive) program development.andP;  Buildingupon earlier work in information retrieval, Yu and several colleagues havecollaborated with a team involved in constructing authoring systems for CD-I.andO;After a brief overview of CD-I, the problem is stated: how to merge multipleaudio streams (e.g., French, English, and German sound tracks to accompany avideo sequence) so that a drive can play back any one of the versions withouthaving to start and stop the reading process, and without recourse tosophisticated buffering.andP;  Since many CD-I systems are limited in terms ofbuffer memory available, and since roughly 50 to 100 kilobytes of data can beread in during the time it takes to interrupt reading from a CD-ROM, theirproblem is a serious one.andP;  Synchronizing audio is another important aspect ofinteractive multimedia systems, and the elegant solutions presented will nodoubt also prove useful in some video applications where multiple planes ofhigh resolution images must be closely synchronized.andM;To conclude this issue, a lively overview of current issues in this field ispresented by Frenkel.andP;  She provides additional information on CD-I, as wellas other related interactive technologies.andP;  Thus, while the emphasispreviously was on methods suitable for video playback from CD-ROM, Frenkelalso considers systems using broadcast television and telephones.andP;  Herextensive collection of statements from many spokesmen regarding competingtechnologies provides a useful counterpoint, and examples of a variety ofinteractive applications now under development gives more insight into theexciting prospects.andP;  Her coverage of the 1989 Microsoft CD-ROM Conferencebrings us almost up-to-date on the latest CD-ROM-related announcements andofferings, and gives a timeline to watch regarding future product plans andstandards efforts.andM;Viewed another way, these eight articles cover four important themes.andP;  Mackayand Davenport, and Frenkel deal with interactivity.andP;  Ripley and Tinker focuson one approach to digital video, and Lippman and Butera provide acontrasting perspective.andP;  The Dixon and Stevens articles, as well as part ofthe Ripley article, deal with applications, and the Mackay and Davenportarticle provides a different perspective on that topic.andP;  Finally, for thoseinterested in highly technical work, Lippman and Butera give details about anexciting area of image processing, and Yu et al.andP;  solve some complex problemsin data merging.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;This special issue provides a variety of perspectives on the emerging fieldof interactive digital video.andP;  While significant process has been made, thereis much work to be done.andP;  It is hoped that the articles in this issue willhelp encourage future work in this field to meet the many challenges andopportunities.andM;ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHYandM;Optical Disks and CD-ROMandM;1.andP;
