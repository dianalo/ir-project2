After Joseph F. Fernandez, 51, the agency's former station chiefin Costa Rica, entered his plea in U.S. District Court, hisattorney said he had committed no crime and that his indictmentsends a ``chilling message'' to the nation's intelligence agents.   The message tells agents that ``Should you become enmeshed inactivities ... involving policies where there may be an absence ofpolitical harmony at home, you may find yourselves upon your returnto the United States the targets of criminal prosecutions,''defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson said in a statement to reporters.   ``Throughout the time Mr. Fernandez served in Costa Rica, hisactions were entirely consistent with United States law and withthe declared policies of the president of the United States,''Wilson said.   Fernandez, who left the CIA last year, stood in U.S. DistrictCourt when U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. asked for hisplea.   ``Your Honor, I plead not guilty,'' the bespectacled defendantsaid in a loud, firm voice.   Fernandez was released on his own recognizance. Outside thecourthouse, a dozen demonstrators carried signs, one of whichcalled Fernandez ``an American hero.''   Law enforcement officials have said Fernandez is the firstformer CIA station chief to be indicted in connection with hisduties.   Wilson said the charges ``relate exclusively to his conduct inhis official capacity as CIA's chief of station in San Jose, CostaRica, between 1984 and 1986. As such, the indictment is a first inthe history of the United States.''   The attorney called the indictment ``a tragedy for JoeFernandez, for his wife, Dale, and for their seven children. It isa tragedy for CIA; and, in the largest sense, it is a tragedy forthis nation.''   Fernandez is accused of participating in an illegal conspiracyto arm the Nicaraguan rebels. He is named in a five-countindictment charging that he and unidentified co-conspirators``deceitfully and without legal authorization'' organized a privatearms supply network for the Contras when Congress banned such aid.He also is charged with lying to his superiors to conceal theoperation.   Fernandez also is accused of obstructing an investigation of thesale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to theContras that was conducted by the presidential commission headed byformer Sen. John Tower, R-Texas.   The indictment says Fernandez lied to the Tower commission lastyear by stating that he did not know for a fact that fired NationalSecurity Council aide Oliver L. North was involved in aiding theContras.   Each of the charges carries a maximum sentence of five years inprison and a $250,000 fine.   The charges are the latest stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the case,already has charged North, former national security adviser John M.Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord withconspiring to divert profits from the arms sales illegally to theContras.   President Reagan has said he knew nothing about the diversion,but testimony before congressional panels last year suggested thatWilliam J. Casey, the CIA director at the time, was aware of thescheme.   Laurence Shtasel, associate independent counsel, told reportersoutside court he could not comment on Casey's role in the affair orwhether other CIA officials face indictment.   Fernandez, who operated in the field under the cover name TomasCastillo, is accused of overseeing the construction of an airstripin northern Costa Rica that the conspiracy built to help deliverarms to the rebels.   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to his superiorsabout the purpose of the airstrip and sent incomplete andunresponsive cables to the agency designed to conceal the operationafter a C-123K cargo plane carrying weapons for the Contras wasshot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, the indictment says.   Fernandez told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that theoperations were authorized by CIA officials. But he admitted hemisled both the Tower commission and the CIA's inspector general,actions he said he thought were ``within the guidelines'' set byClair George, then the agency's deputy director for operations.   Fernandez was one of several CIA officers disciplined by CIADirector William Webster last year.</TEXT></DOC>
