BakerIII made an unconstitutional side agreement with congressionalleaders on $49.8 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras.   The side agreement provides that the Bush administration won'tobligate funds appropriated under the law after next Nov. 30 unlessit receives unanimous consent in writing from nine congressionalleaders, said the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.   The suit says the side agreement doesn't follow constitutionalprocedures requiring consideration by the entire House and Senate.   It was filed by U.S. Reps. Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Chuck Douglas,R-N.H.; Philip Crane, R-Ill., and Robert Smith, R-N.H.   Burton and Crane voted for the law providing the assistance whileDouglas and Smith voted against it.   The votes by the four congressmen ``have been renderedineffective and substantially nullified'' and they have beeninhibited in their performance of their constitutional duties, theysaid in the lawsuit.   Bush on April 18 signed into law a bipartisan plan to give theContras non-military aid.   The aid is intended to sustain the rebels until Nicaragua holdselections early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
