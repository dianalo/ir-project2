Wolfswinkel and a former bankofficer for defrauding several Arizona banks of about $149million in a &quot;check kite scheme.&quot;   Mr. Wolfswinkel and John J.

Mr. O'Neill was Mr.Rhodes's campaign finance manager.   Mr. O'Neill &quot;will plead not guilty. He has alwaysmaintained his innocence and continually sought to cooperatewith the government.
