(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Light PatrolandM;With the recent finalization of Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), theANSI standard for 100Mbps fiber networks, a greater number of end users arelooking with interest at what was previously pigeonholed as a backbonesolution for large networks.andP;  As a media, fiber is also becoming easier towork with in terms of splicing and connecting and is therefore cheaper.andO;Users who once balked at the prohibitive expense are finding that fiber,especially in the long term, can be a reasonable investment.andM;As the technology makes the slow journey from novelty to commodity, morevendors will provide FDDI products.andP;  Even those holdouts who complained thatFDDI was a flash in the pan or were waiting for the Station Management (SMT)portion of the standard to be finalized will be jumping on the ANSI X3T9.5(or FDDI) bandwagon.andM;All this activity is mostly good news for users who want to seriously investin FDDI.andP;  However, the companies that provide FDDI products are notnecessarily FDDI specialists.andP;  While almost all of the fiber companies haveembraced FDDI, other vendors have started to manufacture FDDI versions ofproducts they already made.andP;  Bridge manufacturers, for example, are releasingFDDI-to-Ethernet and FDDI-to-Token Ring bridges.andP;  Other manufacturers areselling mainframe gateways adapted for FDDI networks.andM;This proliferation of products means that end users are sure to haveequipment from a variety of vendors incorporated into their FDDI network.andO;They are also sure to experience interoperability problems.andP;  It's been aninescapable fact of networking life: Whether because of dissimilarimplementations of a standard, timing problems, or some cryptic reason,different systems often do not interoperate.andP;  To a fledgling such as FDDI, itis in each vendor's best interests to guarantee its FDDI productsinteroperate with every other vendors' FDDI products.andP;  It's not enough thatthey ensure that their product conforms to the standard.andP;  Conformance doesnot necessarily equal interoperability with other conformant products, and aproduct can even pass an interoperability test and not comply to a standard.andM;Says Colin Mick, executive director of LanQuest, an independent LAN testhouse in San Jose, Calif., &quot;When you talk about conformance to a standard,you're talking about a stimulus-response effect.andP;  You're saying that when Ahappens, then B should happen.andP;  When you test for conformance, you generateall the A's and look to make sure that the B's occur, and if they do, thetest unit is in conformance.andP;  That doesn't ensure interoperability, becausehow to get from A to B is left to the discretion of the manufacturer.&quot;andM;Two FDDI Test CentersandM;To assure end users that FDDI products from a variety of vendors willinteroperate, two organizations have recently started FDDI interoperabilitytesting labs.andP;  The Advanced Networking Test Center (ANTC) in Sunnyvale,Calif., is run under the auspices of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), aSunnyvale-based maker of an FDDI chip set.andP;  The center was started inresponse to customers' requests for some sort of interoperability testing.andM;&quot;It's been an issue since people started producing FDDI products,&quot; saysSanjay Dhawan, manager of the ANTC facility.andP;  &quot;People want to be confidentthat FDDI is truly a multi-vendor technology.&quot;andP;  The test center givescompanies an advantage not only from an engineering standpoint, but also froma marketing perspective.andP;  Vendors accredited by the ANTC can assure theircustomers of interoperability with a host of other products.andP;  AMD emphasizedat the inception of the ANTC that it would welcome and encourage competitorsand companies that used competitors' products.andM;As a chip set maker, AMD has obvious reasons to establish an interoperabilitytest center.andP;  The other interoperability lab is located in an unlikely place:the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in Durham.andP;  The lab, set up severalmonths before the ANTC facility, provides vendors with interoperabilityaccreditation from a neutral third-party source and gives the university aresearch center for its students.andP;  Foremost in an interoperability testsituation, testers must ensure the testing methods are adequately rigorous.andO;It's not enough to connect equipment from one vendor to an existing testnetwork, since it makes it difficult to isolate interoperability problemswhen they do arise.andP;  At the same time, testing equipment against a single,standalone platform is not enough because interoperability is not atransitive property.andP;  Just because Vendor A's equipment interoperates withVendor B's equipment and Vendor B's interoperates with Vendor C's does notmean that Vendor A's will interoperate with Vendor C's, although it may be agood indicator.andM;&quot;When you test for interoperability in a network situation, there are anincredible number of variables, and it's difficult to control them all,&quot; saysMick.andP;  Lanquest does all the testing for the Open Token Foundation (OTF), aconsortium of Token Ring vendors, and Mick admits that most testing methodsare flawed in some way.andP;  It is nearly impossible to test a machine in everypossible configuration, but test centers try to achieve a practical level ofrigor in their testing.andM;Both the ANTC and UNH facilities use a three-step methodology.andP;  The ANTCfirst tests new equipment or the &quot;system under test&quot; against a stand-alonetest platform, which assures basic functionality.andP;  Then the system under testis tested against each individual system already in the lab.andP;  Once that stageis complete, the system is tested on a live FDDI ring with all otherstations.andP;  It is moved around the ring, so it's tested upstream anddownstream from all other stations.andP;  The equipment then becomes a part of thelab and the testing process, so it's guaranteed to be interoperable with eachpiece of new equipment.andM;The ANTC's test suite focuses on the four main FDDI documents: PhysicalMedium Dependent (PMD), Physical Layer Protocol (PHY), Media Access ControlLayer (MAC), and Station Management (SMT).andP;  The tests treat each vendor'sindividual implementation as a black box, only testing the data transmittedover the fiber itself.andP;  While some of the test suites are still indevelopment, the ANTC proposes two levels of certification.andP;  One level wouldcertify a vendor for each portion of the interoperability test that itpassed.andP;  For example, a piece of equipment that was tested successfully forthe SMT portion of the standard would get an ANTC certification number S-xx.andO;Equipment that passed all four tests would get an FDDI-xx number.andM;The ANTC completed its first interoperability test in June, with a variety ofproducts from nine FDDI vendors, including one from Europe.andP;  AMD claims thatit was the world's first automated structured FDDI multivendorinteroperability test ever performed, as well as being the first test ofversion 6.1 of SMT.andP;  The tests showed that the vendors differingimplementations of SMT, all of which were done in software, wereinteroperable, and that version 6.1 is backward-compatible with version 5.1.andO;Chip sets from both AMD and National Semiconductor were represented among theproducts tested, which included routers, bridges concentrators, and dual- andsingle-attachment stations.andM;Testing at New HampshireandM;The UNH uses three classes of test rings, similar to the three stages oftesting done by the ANTC.andP;  The first, or Class 1, ring consists of astandalone platform which tests for interoperability with specific pieces ofequipment.andP;  The Class 2 ring consists of all the units and tests for generalinteroperability.andP;  The Class 3 ring is a university-wide semiproductionnetwork that tests the unit in a live environment.andM;Barry Reinhold, director of the Interoperability Lab at the UNH, agrees thatinteroperability testing is difficult to do but feels that the productionenvironment is the best testing method.andP;  &quot;Saying I want my device to workwith your device is vague,&quot; says Reinhold.andP;  &quot;We try to put the devices in asemiproduction environment, where we can monitor and control them.andP;  We canbring the rigor of a live environment to what is essentially a beta testsince our users can tolerate some degree of errors.&quot;andM;Universities have long been ideal beta sites for corporations for preciselythat reason, and Reinhold says he has seen the need for an independenttesting facility for years.andP;  &quot;The computing industry has been moving steadilyaway from centralized systems and towards distributed ones,&quot; says Reinhold.andO;&quot;This means that the individual vendor is no longer in control of the overallsystem.andP;  Companies are increasingly concerned with making sure their productswork together.&quot;andM;Aside from the ideal testing situation it provides, the university alsoprovides a neutral environment for vendors skittish about exposing theirdeveloping technologies to competitors.andP;  While from a marketing stand-pointthey may be hesitant, they still need to assure their end users ofinteroperability.andP;  The UNH houses their equipment and makes it available toother companies though a network interface, providing a vehicle forinteroperability testing without exposing any proprietary technology.andM;The university's inherent neutrality is also attractive in terms of thedesign and development of test suites.andP;  &quot;Companies that create their own labshave large vested interests that could polarize the test suites,&quot; saysReinhold.andP;  &quot;That makes their competitors not want to participate.andP;  Of course,interoperability lab tests aren't the same as benchmarking tests, which rateperformance, but tests could conceivably be designed to favor certainimplementations of FDDI.andM;Interoperability testing also isn't a reasonable investment for a lot ofcompanies, since it requires a lot of money and provides very littlemeasurable return.andP;  However, while it may not sell products, it turns out tobe a good way to teach students, which is the primary reason that theuniversity undertook the project.andP;  &quot;It helps the students to reallyunderstand the standards,&quot; says Reinhold.andP;  &quot;they get real-world experience,since we have the technology inhouse.&quot;andP;  The project is entirely funded bydonations, from equipment to integration.andM;Pushing the EnvelopeandM;This kind of interoperability testing is clearly not restricted to FDDI, butit's in a unique position where networking topology goes.andP;  FDDI is not onlymore complex than Ethernet or Token Ring, but it has emerged into a maturenetworking market.andP;  Users are no longer dazzled by the simple fact of beingable to connect PCs and share resources.andP;  They want both performance and aguarantee that their investment will continue to serve them in the long term.andO;The interoperability test centers give users a degree of confidence thattheir systems will not become obsolete anytime soon.andM;While the centers are involved in basic testing right now, both have plansfor expansion in the future.andP;  The ANTC is overseen by a technical advisoryboard comprising its 20 charter members.andP;  Other vendors can be asked to joinby existing members.andP;  The advisory board, which meets every two months duringANSI FDDI standard meetings, is mainly chartered to make sure the test suitesare indicative of real-life multivendor situations.andM;Once the basic test suite is completed, the advisory board may begin to dosome higher level testing.andP;  According to Dhawan, the lab may undertakeFDDI-to-Ethernet interoperability testing and certification, as well asTCP/IP and application testing over FDDI.andP;  The UNH facility already has a10BaseT consortium in place for interoperability testing, although its focusis limited to testing MAUs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
