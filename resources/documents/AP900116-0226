Figures released by the 69-nation organization showed that its50 coffee-producing member countries, which account for 99 per centof all coffee exports, shipped 32.51 million bags in July-November1989, compared with 25.58 million in the same period in 1988. Onebag equals 132 pounds (60 kg).   The coffee organization lifted its export quota system on July 4after consumers and producers failed to agree on terms formaintaining it. The system was aimed at stabilizing prices bybalancing supply with import demand.   The organization's 16-member executive board opened a two-daymeeting Tuesday to discuss the impasse which led to the decision.   Prices have fallen sharply in the free market, and reached a14-year low on the London market on Tuesday.
