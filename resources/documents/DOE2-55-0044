<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-0044 </DOCNO><TEXT>Worker exposures to toluene were determined at the Fasson Division ofthe Materials Group of Avery International in Painesville, Ohio, on May3, 1979. The company was under consideration for inclusion in a NIOSHstudy of the health effects of occupational toluene exposure. Approximately231 of the employees are assigned to the production areas surveyed. Thecompany had no formal safety or industrial-hygiene program. Medical serviceswere furnished by a local clinic and first-aid trained employees. Personnelrecords were available for active and inactive employees dating from1974. Air-sample concentrations for toluene and total hydrocarbons werewell below the existing OSHA permissible-exposure limit of 200 partsper million (ppm) for all areas tested. The authors concluded that theadequacy of this facility for a detailed industrial hygiene survey willbe evaluated in light of its suitability for an epidemiologic study.</TEXT></DOC>
