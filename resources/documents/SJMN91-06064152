Water authorities say it will take 20 more storms as heavy asthe one in recent days to bring water levels back to normal.;    At the sametime, said water resources technician Mark Merritt, more than 2 inches havefallen in the Palo Alto baylands and more than 3 inches at a rain measuringstation between Morgan Hill and Gilroy.;    In the Santa Cruz Mountains, thehillsides were saturated enough to trigger the first significant runoff intoreservoirs this year -- 3,000 acre feet of runoff for the 10 reservoirsoperated by the Santa Clara Valley Water District.;    &quot;That's only 10 percentof capacity,&quot; district official Dick Gates said today.;    In normal times,the reservoirs should pack about 60 percent of their capacity by now, he.;   (An acre foot is nearly 326,000 gallons, which would fill an area the size ofa football field to a depth of 1 foot, or provide enough water to supply atypical family of five for a year.);    Today's early morning storm may havecontributed to a death in Sunnyvale, authorities said.;    Gustau Hass, 72, ofRedwood City was hit and killed by a car at 6:30 a.m. in front of LockheedMissiles and Space Co., and Sunnyvale public safety officers said there is apossibility the rain contributed to the fatal accident.;    Despite theferocity of the weekend storm, damage throughout the region was light.;   Piles of rocks and mud closed Highway 129 east of Watsonville. Gilroy'sdowntown was one big puddle for a while. And residents in the ritzy PacificHeights district of San Francisco managed without electricity Sunday morningafter a falling tree severed power lines.;    Gordon Kauhanen and RogerHartry, meanwhile, were two lucky fishermen. They attempted to take advantageof the beginning of the salmon season, but instead found themselves tossedinto Monterey Bay when 10-foot waves whipped by 58-mph winds capsized their14-foot inflatable raft.;    A passing charter boat quickly rescued them about8:45 a.m. Sunday, Coast Guard spokesman Steve Tierney said.;    &quot;There aren'tmany boats that would dare to go out,&quot; Tierney said. &quot;This weather is just toomuch for them.&quot;;    In the Sierra, many ski resorts opened all their runs forthe first time this season, thanks to four to six feet of new snow.;  Thewater's rising; In less than two days during the weekend, these 10 reservoirsadministered by the Santa Clara Valley Water District added 1,016 acre-feet ofwater from rainfall runoff.
