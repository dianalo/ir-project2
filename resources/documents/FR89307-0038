L. No. 100-670 has made it possiblefor owners of patents directed to new animal drugs and veterinary biologicalproducts that are not biotechnology-generated to apply for extension ofthe term of such patents in a manner similar to the owners of patents directedto human drugs, food additives, color additives, and medical devices. Anew animal drug or veterinary biological product is biotechnology-generatedif it is primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA,hybridoma technology, or other processes including site specific geneticmanipulation techniques. The primary purpose of the proposed rule changeis to revise the present regulations contained in 37 CFR Part 1, SubpartF, to include the two additional categories of subject matter that cannow form the basis of patent term extension. These regulations set forthprocedures that govern the content and submission of applications for theextension of a patent term to the PTO, and procedures governing the extensiondetermination and issuance of patent term extension certifiates by thePTO.The proposed changes also correct some minor errors in the regulationsas they now exist. Section 1.740(a)(9) is proposed to be amended to strikethe requirement that the information to be provided in accordance withthat section must be on a new page of the application for extension ofpatent term. Section 1.741(a)(2) is proposed to be amended to acknowledgethat regulatory review of a product may have occurred under more than oneFederal statute. Section 1.785 is proposed to be amended to indicate thatin cases where the terms of two or more patents are sought to be extendedbased upon the same regulatory review period, an applicant may elect whichterm to extend among eligible patents; in the absence of an election bythe applicant, an appropriate extension of patent term will be given tothe patent with the earliest date of issuance.Initial guidelines directed to the preparation and filing of applicationsfor patent term extension as authorized by Pub. L. No. 100-670 were publishedas ``Guidelines For Extension of Patent Term For New Animal Drugs or VeterinaryBiological Products Under 35 U.S.C. 156 as Amended'' in the Official Gazette.1097 <T3>Official Gazette </T3>63 (December 27, 1988). It is intended that thoseguidelines will continue in effect until the promulgation of final rulesbased on the proposed rule making.The Secretary of Health and Human Services will publish regulations togive guidance concerning the handling of applications for patent term extensionfor a new animal drug in the Department of Health and Human Services.The Secretary of Agriculture will publish regulations to give guidanceconcerning the handling of applications for patent term extension for aveterinary biological product in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Rules</ITAG>Section 1.710(a), if amended as proposed, would specifically set forththe existing policy and practice relating to the eligibility of patentsclaiming a composition or formulation that includes the active ingredient.As noted in the final rule promulgation (53 FR 9386, March 24, 1987), apatent is considered to claim the product where it claims the active ingredientper se, or claims a composition or formulation which contains the activeingredient(s) and reads on the composition or formulation approved forcommercial marketing or use.Section 1.710(b), if amended as proposed, would revise the definition ofhuman drug product in paragraph (b)(1) to make the definition conform toPub. L. No. 100-670. A new paragraph (b)(2) would be added to expand thedefinition of ``product'' in andSection; 1.710(a) to incldue a new animaldrug and a veterinary biological product, but not ones that are primarilymanufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology,or other processes including site specific genetic manipulation techniques.Present paragraph (b)(2) would be renumbered as paragraph (b)(3). It shouldbe understood that the discussion here of new animal drugs and veterinarybiological products is limited to the animal drugs and products definedin Pub. L. No. 100-670.Section 1.720, if amended as proposed, would indicate in paragraph (e)(ii)that the conditions given therein concern a patent for a product otherthan one recited in andSection; 1.710(b)(2) due to the exclusion of biotechnology-generatednew animal drugs and veterinary biological products in Pub. L. No. 100-670.A new paragraph (e)(iii) would be added directed to the provision in 35U.S.C. 156(a)(5)(c), which permits a patent directed to a new animal drugor veterinary biological product to be extended based on a second or subsequentapproval of the active ingredient if the patent claims the drug or product,provided the drug or product is not covered by the claims in any otherpatent that has been extended (``covered by the claims'' means that thedrug or product would infringe a claim in the other patent), if the patentterm was not extended on the basis of the regulatory review period foruse in non-food-producing animals, and if the second or subsequent approvalwas the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug or productfor administration to a food-producing animal. All conditions must existbefore eligibility could be based on this provision of the statute, whichis reflected in proposed new andSection; 1.720(e)(iii). Paragraph (f), ifamended as proposed, would add a new portion of the paragraph directedto the case where eligibility is to be based on 35 U.S.C. 156(a)(5)(C).In this latter case, the application must be field within 60 days of approvalfor administration to a food-producing animal.Section 1.740(a), if amended as proposed, would have paragraph (a)(4) revisedby (1) eliminating ``human'' as a modifier for ``product,'' (2) addingthe Public Health Service Act and the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act to the listof appropriate statutes, and (3) adding a requirement to indicate the usefor which the product was approved. The first two proposed amendments arenecessary to comply with terms of 35 U.S.C. 156 as amended, and the thirdproposed amendment is necessary to a determination of eligibility wherethe application is based on a second or subsequent approval of an activeingredient, but the first approval for administration to a food-producinganimal. Paragraph (a)(9), if amended as proposed, would eliminate the requirementto set forth beginning on a new page the statement that the patent forwhich patent term extension is sought claims the approved product or amethod of using or making same, and the required showing listing each applicableclaim of the patent and demonstrating the manner in which each applicableclaim reads on the approved product or a method of using or making same;this change is proposed because the information required by this paragraphis within the province of PTO review and there is no need to have suchinformation recited in a readily segregable section of the application.Paragraph (a)(10), if amended as proposed, will indicate that, as appropriate,the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculturewill determine the applicable regulatory review period. Paragraph (a)(10)(i),if amended as proposed, will recite also a Product License Applicationas a type of application that may be recited in an application for termextension of a patent claiming a human biological product. New paragraphs(a)(10)(ii) and (a)(10)(iii) are proposed to be added to set forth thetype of tests or applications that are to be considered for determinationof the applicable regulatory review period for patents claiming a new animaldrug or a veterinary biological product. Present paragraphs (a)(10)(ii)and (a)(10)(iii) are proposed to be renumbered as paragraphs (a)(10)(iv)and (a)(10)(v), respectively. Paragraph (a)(10)(v) is also proposed tobe amended to reflect that approval of a medical device could be made throughthe use of a product development protocol. Paragraph (a)(13), if amendedas proposed, will indicate that the duty to disclose any information materialto the determination of entitlement to the extension sought applies alsoto the Secretary of Agriculture where the regulatory review was conductedby the USDA.Section 1.741(a)(2), if amended as proposed, will represent an acknowledgementthat regulatory review may take place under more than one Federal statuteand that each appropriate statute should be listed. This proposed amendmentis intended to apply to a situation where a human biological product istested under an investigational new drug application (IND) pursuant tothe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but is approved under the PublicHealth Service Act. The amendment is not intended to encompass a situationwhere approval is sought for use of a particular medical device with aspecific drug product. The product that forms the basis of an applicationfor patent term extension must be either a medical device or a drug product;it cannot be a combination of those separate products. See the file historyof U.S. Patent No. 4,428,744 for an example of the application of thisprinciple. Section 1.741(a)(5), if amended as proposed, will recognize that the Secretaryof Agriculture may determine the length of the regulatory review periodwhere the regulatory review of the product takes place at the USDA. Thesection is further modified to point out that a determination of the lengthof the regulatory review period is made under 35 U.S.C. 156(g), and notthe length of the patent term extension that is made by the PTO under 35U.S.C. 156(c).Section 1.765(a), if amended as proposed, will recite that a duty of candorand good faith is owed to the Secretary of Agriculture in patent term extensionproceedings wherein the USDA is involved. Section 1.775, if amended as proposed, will have its title recite thatthe section is directed to calculating patent term extension for humandrug, antibiotic drug, and human biological products. Paragraphs (a), (b),(c), and (d), if amended as proposed, will indicate that the determinationsare being made for any of a human drug, an antibiotic drug, or a hmuanbiological product. Sections (c)(1) and (c)(2), if amended as proposed,will refer merely to a ``product'' rather than to a ``human drug product''or a ``drug product'' in order to make the sections more clear. Section 1.778, if added as proposed, would set forth the manner of calculationof the patent term extension for an animal drug product. Proposed paragraph (a) would specify that the extension will run from theoriginal expiration date of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer.Proposed paragraph (b) of andSection; 1.778 would provide that the patentterm would be extended by the regulatory review period for the productbut reduced, where appropriate, by the time periods provided in proposedparagraph (d). Proposed paragraph (c) defines how the regulatory review period is to becalculated. The period is determined by counting (1) The number of days in the period beginning on the earlier of the datesa major health or environmental effects test was initiated on the drugor an exemption under subsection (j) of section 512 of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective for the drug and ending on thedate an application was initially submitted for the drug under section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and (2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date the applicationwas initially submitted for the approved drug under subsection (b) of section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and ending on the datethe application was approved under the section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The added total of the days determined in subparagraphs (c)(1) and(c)(2) constitutes the regulatory review period, which is then reduced,where appropriate, by the time periods described in proposed paragraph(d). Proposed paragraph (d) of andSection; 1.778 would revise the term of thepatent extension by indicating that (1) The time period determined from proposed paragraph (c) would be reduced,where appropriate, by (i) The number of days in the period of proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and(c)(2) of andSection; 1.778 that were before the date on which the patentissued;(ii) The number of days in proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of andSection;1.778 during which it is determined under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B) that applicantdid not act with due diligence; and (iii) The number of days equal to one-half the number of days remainingin proposed paragraph (c)(1) after the paragraph (c)(1) determination hasbeen reduced in accordance with proposed paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii)of andSection; 1.778 (half days to be ignored for subtraction purposes);(2) Adding the number of days determined in proposed paragraph (d)(1) tothe original expiration date of the patent as shortened by any terminaldisclaimer; (3) Adding 14 years to the date of approval of the application under section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;(4) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) witheach other and selecting the earlier date; (5) If the original patent issued after November 16, 1988, by_(i) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and (ii) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(i)with each other and selecting the earlier date;(6) If the original patent issued before November 16, 1988, and (i) If no major health or environmental effects test on the drug was initiatedand no request was submitted for an exemption under subsection (j) of section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before November 16, 1988,by_(A) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(i)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date; or(ii) If a major health or environmental effects test was initiated or arequest for an exemption under subsection (j) of section 512 of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was submitted before November 16, 1988, andthe application for commercial marketing or use of the drug was not approvedbefore November 16, 1988, by_(A) Adding 3 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(B) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(ii)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date.Section 1.779, if added as proposed, would set forth the manner of calculationof the patent term extension for a veterinary biological product.Proposed paragraph (a) would specify that the extension will run from theoriganal expiration date of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer.Proposed paragraph (b) of andSection; 1.779 would provide that the patentterm would be extended by the regulatory review period for the productbut reduced, where appropriate, by the time periods provided in proposedparagraph (d).Proposed paragraph (c) defines how the regulatory review period is to becalculated. The period is determined by counting(1) The number of days in the period beginning on the date the authorityto prepare an experimental biological product under the Virus-Serum-ToxinAct became effective and ending on the date an application for a licensewas submitted under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act; and(2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date an applicationfor a license was initially submitted under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act andending on the date a license was issued.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The added total of the days determined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)constitutes the regulatory review period, which is then reduced, were appropriate,by the time periods described in proposed paragraph (d).Paragraph (d) of proposed andSection; 1.779 would define the term of thepatent extension by indicating that(1) The time period determined from proposed paragraph (c) would be reduced,where appropriate, by(i) The number of days in the periods of proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and(c)(2) that were on and before the date on which the patent issued;(ii) The number of days in the periods of proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and(c)(2) during which it is determined under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B) thatthe applicant did not act with due diligence; and(iii) One-half the number of days remaining in the period defined by proposedparagraph (c)(1) after that period is reduced in accordance with paragraphs(d)(1)(i) and (d)(ii) (half days being ignored for purposes of subtraction);(2) Adding the number of days determined in paragraph (d)(1) to the originalterms of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer;(3) Adding 14 years to the date of the issuance of a license under theVirus-Serum-Toxin Act;(4) Comparing the dates for the ends of the periods obtained pursuant toparagraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) and selecting the earlier date;(5) If the patent was issued after November 16, 1988, by_(i) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(ii) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(i)with each other and selecting the earlier date;(6) If the original patent issued before November 16, 1988 and(i) If no request for the authority to prepare an experimental biologicalproduct under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was submitted before November 16,1988, by_(A) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(i)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date; or(ii) If a request for the authority to prepare an experimental biologicalproduct under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was submitted before November 16,1988 and the commercial marketing or use of the Product was not approvedbefore November 16, 1988, by_(A) Adding 3 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and (B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(ii)(A)and selecting the earlier date.Section 1.785(b), if amended as proposed, will indicate that, in thoseinstances where an applicant is seeking patent term extension for two ormore patents based upon the same regulatory review period, the applicantwill have the right to elect which patent is to have its term extended.In the absence of an election by applicant, the Commissioner will extendthat patent having the earliest date of issuance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The proposed rule change is in conformity with the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291and 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration that the proposedrule change will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities [Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354].The proposed rule change setting forth procedures allowing owners of patentsdirected to new animal drugs and veterinary biological products to applyfor extension of patent term would not be expected to result in any adverseeconomic impact on small entities because patented drugs are generallynot commercialized by small entities.The PTO has determined that this rule change is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291. The annual effect to the economy will be less than$100 million. There will be no major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions. There will be no significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.The PTO has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the National Government and the Statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612.The proposed rule contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>which has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for approval. Preparation of an application for patent term extensionis estimated to take approximately 60 hours, including time for reviewinginstructions, gathering and maintaining data needed and completing andreviewing the collection of information.
