(products).andO;Ticker:    MSFT.andO;Product:   Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (market share)OS/2 Presentation Manager (Graphical user interface) (marketshare).andO;Topic:     Market ShareWindowingSoftware PublishersSalesInterviewAttitude.andO;Person:    Patton, Carole (interviews).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Within the last year, Windows has made a remarkable transition from aPresentation Manager training-wheels product to a serious developmentenvironment.andP;  Finally, major horizontal applications and specializedprogramming tools are beginning to surface, even from microsoft's archrivals.andO;in fact, it's becoming hard to find PC developers who don't expect to releaseWindows-based products within the next few years.andM;But we still hear a good deal of grumbling about the quality of the Windowscode and--perhaps more importantly--about Microsoft's equivocal support ofWindows third-party companies.andP;  Developers may be exquisitely polite aboutmicrosoft in public, but privately they rank the company's reputation forsincerity on a par with used car salesmen, politicians, and TV evangelists.andM;Some of the complaints we hear, of course, are clearly inspired by a mixtureof envy at Microsoft's success and a dash of classic notinvented-heresyndrome.andP;  But even Microsoft's closest development partners say they don'treally trust the gang from Redmond.andP;  &quot;windows will probably succeed becauseMicrosoft is determined to own the whole world,&quot; said one.andP;  &quot;Are wecomfortable with that attitude? Not really.&quot;andM;One observer who has been openly critical of Microsoft's Windows evangelismeffort is Carole Patton, the publisher of ACKnowledge/The Window Letter, amonthly newsletter targeted at Windows users in Fortune 1000 companies.andO;Patton is full of praise for windows itself (especially for Windows 3.0, anunnannounced but widely-previewed upgrade that will probably ship early nextyear).andP;  But she argues that Microsoft continues to create unnecessaryobstacles that hinder the acceptance of Windows as a viable environment forcommercial developers.andM;We recently asked Patton for her appraisal of the current and future Windowsmarketplace:andM;Earlier this year, you said Microsoft has been &quot;leading windows developersdown the primrose path with overblown estimates of Windows sales.&quot; What'syour latest estimate of the real size of the Windows installed base?andM;&quot;Microsoft claims to be shipping a million copies of windows every year.andO;That's pure bunk.andP;  If it were true, Windows would be on top of the bestsellerlists along with Lotus 1-2-3 and Word Perfect.andP;  Also, about $16 million inadditional Windows revenue would be showing up on Microsoft's incomestatement, and I don't see any big jumps there.andP;  in fact, if you askretailers what the demand for Windows is right now, they'll tell you thereisn't any.andM;&quot;I would place the real size of the windows installed base at between 300,000and 500,000 copies, not including run-time versions that were shipped withWindows applications.andP;  That estimate is in line with the actual sales ofcompanies selling windows products--and those numbers are small.andP;  Micrografxis the top seller, and they probably do about $27 million in annual sales.andO;Aldus does a very small business with PageMaker for Windows.andP;  And I would besurprised if Samna has sold more than 5,000 copies of Ami.andP;  Even Microsofthas probably sold only 50,000 or 60,000 copies of PC Excel.&quot;andM;Are there any smaller Windows developers who are doing well in niche markets?andM;&quot;Except in the graphics and publishing area, there has been a lukewarm marketresponse to most new Windows products.andP;  We get review copies of wonderfulsoftware that carry ridiculously low serial numbers--like 105, or 287.andO;Usually the serial number is hand written on the disk in pencil.andP;  You knowthe developer hasn't sold many copies.andM;&quot;On the other hand, Windows is booming abroad.andP;  Micrografx president PaulGrayson told me recently that nearly 60% of his sales were coming from Europeand Australia.andP;  Other developers say they're getting a lot of overseasinquiries, but often they don't have the manpower to follow up...andM;Do you expect the release of Windows 3.0 (a version you've said is&quot;terrific&quot;) to have much impact?andM;&quot;Windows 3.0 will stimulate the market tremendously because it breaks the640K barrier.andP;  All the other changes are cosmetic, including an improved userinterface for the desktop manager.andP;  Microsoft is showing 3.0 with Excel atcorporate beta sites, and corporate users who were talking OS/2 six monthsago are planning for Windows instead.andM;&quot;Moreover, Microsoft has plans to bundle Windows 3.0 with DOS next year.andO;That'll break the market wide open--by millions of copies.andP;  I expectMicrosoft will make a real push to get a Windows/DOS combination onto as many286 and 386 machines as possible.andP;  Remember, DOS is microsoft's biggestsuccess story, and windows is a Dos upgrade.&quot;andM;You've been critical of microsoft for failing to help smaller companies thatsell development tools and other windows aftermarket products.andP;  Has therebeen any progress is this area?andM;&quot;Last January, Microsoft closed off access to its mailing list of registeredWindows users.andP;  For small software developers this was a disaster.andP;  That'sbecause three or four software distributors control national markets and thedealer channel won't handle a product until it's a major hit.andP;  &quot;Fortunately,Microsoft recently reversed its mailing list policy and will probablyannounce later this month that its list will be available to developers on acase-by-case basis.andP;  in fact, the new policy will let developers use the listfree the first time, as long as they are marketing a product and not fishingaround for prospect names.andP;  This is great news.andM;&quot;Incidentally, I think one reason Microsoft closed off the list was becausepeople could readily see that the numbers the company was claiming forWindows sales didn't jibe with the number of registered users.andP;  Another evenbigger reason: Microsoft was probably worried that a competitor like Lotuswould use the list to grab away Excel users.&quot;andM;Microsoft's concern about protecting Excel (and other applications) raises arelated question: Does microsoft have an obligation to support developers whocompete with Microsoft's own products?andM;&quot;If Microsoft was purely an applications house, I couldn't fault them.andP;  Theycertainly don't owe their competitors anything.andP;  But they are also a systemshouse selling an environment called Windows.andP;  it's in microsoft's interest tosupport their developers.andP;  it doesn't look good when your customers gobankrupt.andM;&quot;Microsoft will have to deal with this issue head-on one day.andP;  I know severalwindows developers who can't raise capital because investors think theproposed product will compete with an application microsoft is workingon.andO;it's pretty silly to have to base your business plan on whether or notmicrosoft will develop a competing product.andP;  I believe Microsoft musteventually split up its systems and applications divisions much as Apple didby spinning off Claris.&quot;andM;Do you expect Presentation Manager to cut into sales of Windows titles?andM;&quot;For the next three to five years the Pc market will belong to Windows.andP;  Onereason is because corporations are just now retiring some of their outdated8086s and 8088s and are standardizing on 286 and 386-based machines that canrun windows.andM;&quot;Those new machines could run os/2 just as well, but they won't.andP;  ThePresentation Manager products we see are windows remakes--PageMaker, Packrat,and Excel--and offer no real advantages under OS/2.andP;  Users know that, too.andO;For example, Informix software developed an os/2 version of Wingz, thendiscovered at PC Expo in June that there was no market for it.andP;  Now, Informixis belatedly doing a windows version.andM;&quot;Programmers wax poetic about OS/2 because they like the technology.andP;  ButuserB never buy technology; they buy products.andP;  Besides, windows 3.0 willhave OS/2's multitasking and memory management abilities--and it will run DOSprograms.andP;  The only thing Windows 3.0 won't have is multithreading.andP;  Peoplewith industrial or engineering systems might be concerned about that, butsecretaries and most professionals don't care a whit.andP;  Keep in mind that 90%of the people who use computers in offices are support personnel--and there'sno such thing as a low-co3t OS/2 workstation on the horizon.andM;&quot;In short, OS/2 is like doing a trapeze act.andP;  You leap, and hope IBM is thereto catch you.andP;  Windows doesn't require any great leaps of faith or radicalcommitments.andP;  It's just DOS, only better.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
