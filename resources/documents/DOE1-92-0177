The otheris called Acid Retardation, and applies to the highly ionized acids.Phosphoric acid is commonly used for metal treatment. Phosphoric acidis used to clean other metals, steel, and stainless steel, to removescale, or radioactivity. Activated carbon is made by leaching out theash components of wood, Ca, Mg, K, and Na, using H{sub 3}PO{sub 4}. Phosphoricacid is not only expensive, but also enhances algae growth when dumpedto the environment. Continuous Countercurrent Ion Exchange (CCIX) equipment,is paramount in maintaining H{sub 3}PO{sub 4} strength and being ableto tolerate the very low distribution coefficient of metal ions for cationresin. A successful production plant will be presented which has includedmobile equipment and a Model 3624 Folded CCIX unit that extracts 95%to 99% of the metals from 35% H{sub 3}PO{sub 4} at about 60 gpm. In strongionized acids or salt plus acids there is selective and strong sorptionof the H-ion. Water is, therefore, the only eluting agent necessary forthe acid. This is called Acid Retardation and is useful for salt-acidseparations. Specific areas of application are, anodizing wastes, cationregenerant wastes, lead battery waste, electrowinning cell blow-downwaste, and more generally almost any industrial waste that is a mixtureof acid and salts. Again, continuous countercurrent flow is vital forpracticability, to keep solutions strong.</TEXT></DOC>
