The acquisition of Piscataway, N.J.-based RCA Globcom will give MCI an important base for expanding its voice telecommunications business overseas. In addition, the purchase would boost MCI's share of the international telex market to about 45% from an estimated 20%.    Although it generates considerable cash, the telex industry is slowly declining and undergoing a consolidation as the world-wide use of voice communications continues to expand. Consequently, Wall Street analysts suspect that Washington-based MCI wants to exploit RCA Globcom's ties with foreign governments. RCA Globcom has been conducting business internationally since the 1920s.    &quot;MCI wants to use RCA Globcom's relationships with foreign countries to convert its telex services into voice services,&quot; said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst for PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Telex is a dying business.&quot;    &quot;It's a strategic move,&quot; acknowledged H. Brian Thompson, MCI's executive vice president. &quot;It gives us an opportunity to penetrate the voice markets.&quot;    MCI's current share of the international telephone market is about 2%, while American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. dominates with about a 95% share. ATandamp;T doesn't provide telex services.    GE put RCA Globcom up for sale in February because the unit didn't fit GE's stated strategy of being a market leader in all of its businesses.    GE apparently cut RCA Globcom's price to sell it to MCI. When the unit initially went on the market, potential purchasers said GE wanted an exorbitant price, more than ITT Corp. was asking for its ITT World Communications Inc. unit, which was put up for sale in 1986.    As reported, ITT has agreed to sell ITT Worldcom for $135 million plus $35 million of debt to New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, who also considered buying RCA Globcom. Industry executives said MCI also considered buying ITT's business.    Mr. LeBow has said that RCA's Globcom business is about the same size as ITT's, which last year had a loss of $8.2 million on revenue of $207.3 million. MCI wouldn't disclose earnings figures for RCA Globcom. </TEXT></DOC>
