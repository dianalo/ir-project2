Background </ITAG>On September 17, 1985, RSPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> under Docket HM-183,183A (50 FR 37766). TheNPRM contained proposals to revise and clarify the HMR pertaining to themanufacture, maintenance, requalification and use of all specificationcargo tanks. These proposals were based on research findings, petitionsfor rule change, requests for interpretation of the regulations, recommendationsfrom other agencies, and RSPA's and the Federal Highway Administration's(FHWA) efforts to eliminate certain exemptions and to correct discrepanciesand deficiencies appearing in the requirements for cargo tanks in the HMR.On December 5, 1985, RSPA published a document making certain correctionsand changes to the NPRM (50 FR 49866), and on January 23, 1986, RSPA extendedthe time for filing written comments on the NPRM (51 FR 3085). Interestedreaders should refer to the aforementioned documents for additional backgrounddiscussion. During 1985 and 1986, RSPA and FHWA held a public briefing and three publichearings to allow interested persons to participate in this rulemakingproceeding. In addition, RSPA received over 100 written comments on theproposals contained in the NPRM. These comments were from trade associations,cargo tank manufacturers and repairers, shippers, carriers, disinterestedinspectors, insurance organizations, State and local agencies, etc. Allcomments, including late submission and hearing transcripts, were reviewedby RSPA and FHWA staff members. These comments contain many diverse viewson how to improve the safe transportation of hazardous materials in cargotanks. Some of the comments were vague or unsupported by data. RSPA andFHWA held a series of public working meetings with certain commenters toobtain clarification of their comments and additional supporting informationon their alternate proposals. These meetings were held from March 1987through February 1988. Several well-defined aspects of the NPRM were the subject of most of thecommentary. In some cases, a review of the costs and safety benefits involvedhas resulted in modification of the proposals. A listing of twenty-fourof the most important proposals appeared in the preamble of the NPRM beginningat 50 FR 37766. These proposals are repeated below with an indication,in brackets, of whether the proposal is or is not adopted in this finalrule. The NPRM proposed_ 1. To require that each manufacturer of cargo tanks hold a current AmericanSociety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Certificate of Authorization. [adopted]2. To require that each cargo tank designed with an internal design pressureof 15 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or greater be ``constructed andcertified in conformance with the ASME Code'', and each cargo tank withan internal design pressure less than 15 psig be ``constructed in accordancewith the ASME Code.'' [adopted with changes] 3. To require that all new specification cargo tanks be certified by anAuthorized Inspector who is commissioned by the National Board of Boilerand Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board). [adopted with changes]4. To require that ring stiffeners on a cargo tank be of a design thatcan be visually inspected. [adopted with changes] 5.

[adopted with changes] 24. To require that an owner of a cargo tank used in the transportationof hazardous materials keep certain records. [adopted] Those proposed requirements which met with substantial objection by commentersare discussed in this preamble by subject. Following the subject-by-subjectreview is a review by section which briefly discusses each section of therule and the significant changes that have been made since the NPRM. (Asused in this preamble, ``we'' refers to ``RSPA and FHWA''.) <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Specification Design And Construction Requirements_Part 178 </ITAG>Several commenters, including the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association(TTMA) and the National Tank Truck Carriers (NTTC), stated that the proposedrule so fundamentally changes the design and construction of new cargotanks that confusion will exist among inspectors, shippers, buyers, etc.unless designations other than MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 are used. TTMAfurther stated that the MC specification numbers were changed in 1967 followingminor changes in the specifications. We agree with these commenters andhave revised the specification designations covering new cargo tank constructions.Instead of the ``MC'' prefix designation, these new specification designationsare preceded with a ``DOT'' prefix for consistency with the prefix designationsof other DOT packaging specifications. To eliminate confusion in the futureto references for the now obsolete MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tankspecifications contained in andSection;andSection; 178.340 through 178.343,we have revised the section numbering designations. These new individualspecifications and section numbering designations are: DOT 406 (andSection;178.346), DOT 407 (andSection; 178.347), and DOT 412 (andSection; 178.348).The general requirements applicable to these specification cargo tanksare contained in andSection; 178.345. In this preamble, we have used these specifications and section designationsto distinguish between discussions of the existing cargo tanks and thenew cargo tank construction requirements. A. Application of the ASME Code to Low Pressure Cargo Tanks Commenters objected to the proposed requirement that all new DOT specificationcargo tanks be constructed in conformance with the American Society ofMechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code),and that each cargo tank with an internal design pressure greater than15 psig be ``constructed and certified in conformance with the ASME Code.''They argued that the ASME Code does not apply to low-pressure (i.e. pressuresbelow 15 psig) non- stationary vessels. Several commenters, including theTTMA and the NTTC, stated that DOT 406 cargo tanks, and DOT 407 cargo tankswith a working pressure less than 50 psig should be constructed by a manufacturerholding a current ASME Certificate of Authorization, but should not be``constructed in accordance with the ASME Code.'' Commenters also statedthat requiring the design and construction of DOT 406 cargo tanks in accordancewith the ASME Code would in practice eliminate oval tank designs and requirethe construction of tanks with a cylindrical shell and heads, with a knuckleradius larger than that currently used. This circular cross section designwould create cargo tanks with a higher center of gravity that are lessstable than the currently designed oval cross-section tanks. Commentersstated that compliance with the ASME Code for low pressure DOT 407 cargotanks (design pressure less than 50 psig) would also eliminate the practiceof manufacturing multi-cargo tank motor vehicles with inserted (``stuffed'')heads and require a redesign of these cargo tanks to incorporate headswith a 6% knuckle radius. Commenters claimed that if these proposals wereadopted, manufacturers would no longer be able to shape their own headsand would have to purchase them. TTMA maintained there is no adverse accidentexperience data to substantiate that the current knuckle radius and the``stuffed head'' configuration have presented any safety problems. TTMAlisted a number of sections in the ASME Code which they stated should notapply to the construction of DOT 406 cargo tanks, which included thosesections on head formation and installation. Although the ASME Code allows an exception for pressure vessels with aninternal design pressure of less than 15 psig from the requirements ofthe ASME Code, we believe these vessels can be constructed in accordancewith the ASME Code. Extending the application of the ASME Code to DOT 406cargo tanks should enhance the overall quality of construction of DOT 406cargo tanks. However, we recognize there are certain design configurationsand construction practices used in constructing MC 306 and MC 307 cargotanks for many years that have been proven to be reliable. Therefore, asadopted in this final rule, DOT 406 cargo tanks must be constructed inaccordance with the ASME Code, with certain exceptions. These exceptions,found in andSection; 178.346-1, will allow the continued use of the ``stuffedhead'' configuration and permit a knuckle radius of three times the materialthickness and not less than one-half inch. Similar exceptions are providedfor DOT 407 cargo tanks with a working pressure of 35 psig or less. Currently only DOT Specification MC 307 cargo tanks with a working pressuregreater than 50 psig are required to be designed in accordance with theASME Code. The NPRM proposed that all DOT Specification MC 307 cargo tanksbe constructed and certified in conformance with the ASME Code. In consideringthe design requirements for DOT 407 cargo tanks, we reviewed the data submittedshowing the number and pressure rating of current MC 307 cargo tanks.A review of the data showed that 35 psig is a natural breakpoint for cargotank construction in the current fleet. Cargo tanks with a maximum allowableworking pressure greater than 35 psig are generally not constructed withstuffed heads. Because of this natural breakpoint and the fact that thehazard to the public increases with pressure, we have required that allDOT 407 cargo tanks with a maximum allowable working pressure greater than35 psig be constructed and certified in conformance with the ASME Code.Commenters did not object to the application of the ASME Code to higherpressure DOT 407 and most DOT 412 cargo tanks. This requirement has beenincluded in the final rule. B. Cargo Tank: Manufacturer Qualification, Registration, Quality Control,and Certification The existing DOT certification system for cargo tanks, except for ASMECode tanks, allows a manufacturer to certify that a cargo tank conformsto all requirements of the applicable specification. The HMR contain nocriteria for assessment of a manufacturer's knowledge and skills in exercisingthe certification process. As we stated in the NPRM, most cargo tank manufacturersexhibit great knowledge, skills, and integrity; however, a number of manufacturershave demonstrated very limited knowledge and skill about matters such asstress analyses, welding, metallurgy, recognized good design and qualitycontrol practices, and the HMR. We believe that a qualification systemis necessary for all cargo tank manufacturers to assure quality control.Further, we believe that a qualification system is needed for those whoinspect and certify cargo tanks to assure a high level of compliance withthe design, construction, and test requirements. To achieve this goal,the NPRM proposed:<ITAG tagnum="16">_All cargo tank manufacturers hold a current ASME ``U'' Certificateof Authorization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_An Authorized Inspector commissioned by the National Board must certifyeach DOT cargo tank in accordance with the ASME Code and the applicablespecification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_For repairs on cargo tanks involving welding on the tank wall, anAuthorized Inspector certify the repair and the repair work must be performedby: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Manufacturers who hold an ASME ``U'' Certificate of Authorization;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Repairers who hold a National Board ``R'' Certificate of Authorization;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Persons who do not hold an ASME or National Board Certificate, providedthat the work is performed under the direct supervision of an AuthorizedInspector and the cargo tank has a design pressure of less than 15 psig.</ITAG>Commenters generally supported the requirement that all cargo tank manufacturershold a current ASME Certificate of Authorization on the basis that it willassure a minimum level of manufacturing qualification, particularly forwelding and quality control procedures. However, some commenters arguedthat the cost of obtaining an ASME Certificate of Authorization for useof the ``U'' stamp would be excessive. We should point out that existingandSection; 178.340-2(a) prescribes that cargo tanks are to be ``* * * designedand constructed in accordance with the best known and available practices* * *.'' The ASME Code is a nationally recognized industry standard forthe design and construction of pressure vessels and ASME quality controlprocedures and qualified welders are among the best known and available.We believe that the cost of obtaining a ``U'' stamp will be minimal forthose manufacturers currently using the ``best known and available practices''as currently prescribed in the HMR. A number of cargo tank manufacturerscurrently hold an ASME Certificate of Authorization. We believe that requiringall new DOT specification cargo tanks be constructed by a manufacturerholding a current ASME Certificate of Authorization is necessary to enhancethe qualifications of cargo tank manufacturers. Therefore, this requirementis adopted as proposed. Commenters objected to the proposed use of Authorized Inspectors, to theexclusion of all other possible inspectors, for the inspection and certificationof cargo tanks. They argued that: (1) The manufacturer or the owner ofa cargo tank is the person who is best qualified to certify that the cargotank conforms to the applicable specification; (2) Authorized Inspectorsare not knowledgeable in the DOT specification requirements and the experienceof these persons is limited to stationary pressure vessels and not to cargotank motor vehicles; and (3) requiring the use of an Authorized Inspectorto certify each cargo tank would result in production delays due to inspectionscheduling difficulties arising from the limited number of Authorized Inspectorscurrently commissioned by the National Board. In addition, commenters characterizedthe cost of employing an Authorized Inspector for cargo tank certificationas excessive, adding as much as $1,000 to the cost of each cargo tank.As an alternative to requiring that all DOT specification cargo tanks beconstructed in accordance with the ASME Code and inspected and certifiedby an Authorized Inspector, commenters recommended that all cargo tankmanufacturers hold a current ASME ``U'' stamp, follow quality control proceduresaccording to the ASME Code, and register with the DOT. Commenters suggestedvariations of the registration alternative ranging from a simple notificationof activities to DOT approval of all cargo tank manufacturing facilities.Commenters presented similar arguments and alternative proposals with regardto cargo tank repairers. The NTTC, in its comments, recommended that manufacturersand repairers, as well as hazardous materials shippers and carriers, berequired to register a notification of their activities with the Department.This registration would include an annual report of the organization'sactivities and operations and the name of the corporate officer responsiblefor compliance with the regulations. In its comments to the docket, the TTMA simply stated that ``MC specificationcargo tank manufacturers should be registered with DOT.'' In the publicworking meeting held between the DOT and the National Petroleum Gas Association(NPGA; formerly the National L-P Gas Association) and Compressed Gas Association(CGA), the participants proposed that the DOT inspect and approve cargotank manufacturers and repairers as a condition of their doing businessin the area of DOT specification cargo tanks. In other public working meetings,representatives from the NTTC, TTMA, American Petroleum Institute (API),NPGA, and CGA suggested that, in conjunction with the registration program,inspection and certification of cargo tank manufacturers be conducted byDOT inspectors or by ``DOT approved'' inspectors, who could be employeesof the manufacturer. In summary, commenters have supported DOT's beliefthat qualification standards are necessary for persons who manufacture,assemble, repair, inspect, or certify cargo tanks and cargo tank motorvehicles.With respect to the qualifications for persons who manufacture or repaircargo tanks, we believe a basic competency evaluation and approval is demonstratedby the person's having an ASME or National Board Certificate of Authorization.To obtain an authorization, the applicant's employees, facilities, andquality assurance plan must be audited and approved. These approval processesby the ASME and National Board are nationally and internationally recognizedsystems. Most commenters have agreed that this would provide an acceptablequalification standard. Because of the quality and broad acceptance ofthe ASME's and National Board's approval processes, we believe it is notnecessary for DOT to further audit and approve persons who hold these certificatesas proposed by several commenters. DOT approval of persons holding thesecertificates would be unnecessarily costly and burdensome. Furthermore,because cargo tank motor vehicle assemblers do not manufacture cargo tanksbut only assemble cargo tanks to motor vehicles, we believe it is unnecessaryto require these assemblers to obtain an ASME Certificate of Authorization.With respect to the qualifications for persons who inspect or certify cargotanks and cargo tank motor vehicles, we still believe that the currentsystem of self-certification is inadequate since no qualification requirementsare placed on persons who inspect and certify cargo tank design, construction,repair, and testing for conformance with the applicable specifications.However,  because of the stringent qualification standards for personswho manufacture or repair cargo tanks, we agree with many commenters thatthese functions can be adequately performed by individuals other than ``disinterested''Authorized Inspectors who have the necessary qualifications. We believethese qualifications can be developed through a combination of educationand work experience, particularly experience in cargo tank design, construction,or repair. To ease the economic and scheduling burden in requiring thatthe person performing the certification be an Authorized Inspector commissionedby the National Board, in this final rule we are allowing greater flexibilityin the selection of inspectors, as recommended by commenters. In place of the proposed requirement for independent review of each cargotank by an Authorized Inspector, we have relaxed the provisions in thefinal rule to provide that the design be certified by a ``design certifyingengineer'' and that construction, assembly, and repair of cargo tanks becertified by a ``Registered Inspector.'' For certification of a cargo tankdesign, a design certifying engineer may be an Authorized Inspector whohas the knowledge and ability to determine if a cargo tank design meetsthe applicable DOT specification, or a person other than an AuthorizedInspector, such as a professional engineer (registered by the appropriateauthority of a State of the United States or a Province of Canada) whohas this knowledge and ability. The design certifying engineer must haveat least one year of work experience in structural or mechanical designand an engineering degree. We believe these qualifications are necessaryto ensure that the individual performing the functions of a design certifyingengineer has knowledge and skill in areas such as stress analysis, welding,metallurgy, and recognized good design and quality control practices. For certification of cargo tank construction, assembly or repairs, a RegisteredInspector may be an Authorized Inspector who has the knowledge and abilityto determine if a cargo tank conforms with the applicable DOT specificationor a person other than an Authorized Inspector who has this ability. TheRegistered Inspector must have the following combination of work experiencein cargo tank construction or repair, and education: One year of work experienceand a bachelors degree in engineering, two years of work experience andan associate degree in engineering, or three years of work experience anda high school diploma. These qualifications are the same as those prescribedby the National Board for Authorized Inspectors. We believe these qualificationsare necessary to ensure that the individual performing the functions ofa Registered Inspector has knowledge and skill in areas such as welding,metallurgy, and recognized cargo tank design and quality control practices.We agree with commenters that it is difficult at present for DOT to monitorcompliance with and enforcement of the HMR, because it is difficult toidentify and locate persons who manufacture, assemble, repair, inspect,or certify cargo tanks or cargo tank motor vehicles. The NPRM would haverequired that all DOT specification cargo tanks be constructed in conformancewith the ASME Code, and inspected and certified by an Authorized Inspectorwho has been approved by the National Board. The repair of cargo tanksalso would have been inspected and certified by an Authorized Inspector.This would have included an approval and registration process under boththe ASME and the National Board but not with the DOT. We no longer believethis ASME and National Board approval process to be necessary for eachcargo tank. We believe it is unnecessary for DOT to approve each cargotank manufacturer or repairer, as suggested by some commenters, since aswe have stated a basic competency evaluation and approval is demonstratedby having an ASME or National Board Certificate of Authorization. However,we believe that it is necessary for such persons to be identified to DOT.Therefore, in new Subpart F of Part 107, requirements for the registrationby RSPA of cargo tank manufacturers, assemblers, and repairers have beenadopted, in place of the more extensive approval and registration processesproposed in the notice and suggested by commenters. Under the registration provisions in Subpart F to Part 107, as adoptedherein, any person engaged in the manufacture, assembly, certification,inspection or repair of a DOT specification cargo tank or cargo tank motorvehicle, or a cargo tank manufactured under the terms of an exemption,must register with the Department. Information and documents required tobe submitted as a part of the registration for manufacturers include: (1) A current ASME Certificate of Authorization. (2) A statement signed by the person who has oversight for ensuring compliancewith the applicable requirements of the chapter. The person must certifyknowledge of those requirements and that each employee who has responsibilityfor ensuring quality control during the manufacture of a cargo tank, orfor ensuring compliance with other cargo tank specification, qualificationor design requirements, will meet certain minimum qualification requirements.(3) A description of the specific function to be performed, e.g., manufactureof cargo tanks, or the assembly of cargo tanks to a motor vehicle.Information and documents required to be submitted by repairers are thesame as those for manufacturers, except that a National Board Certificateof Authorization for use of the ``R'' stamp may be submitted instead ofan ASME Certificate. Registration renewal will be every three years orupon reissuance of the ASME or National Board Certification, whicheveroccurs first. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Qualification, Maintenance_Part 180 </ITAG>This final rule establishes a new Part 180 containing all requirementsapplicable to persons who perform functions relating to maintenance andcontinuing qualification of packagings, such as prescribed inspections,testing, reconditioning and repair of cargo tanks. An outline of the subpartsthat will be contained in Part 180 and the present sections containingthese requirements are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Part 180_Continuing Qualification and Maintenance of Packagings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart A_General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart B_Non-bulk packagings (except cylinders); Qualification andmaintenance (andSection; 173.28).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart C_Cylinders; Qualification and maintenance (andSection; 173.34).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart D_Portable Tanks; Qualification and maintenance (andSection;andSection;173.32, 173.32a, 173.32b, 173.32c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart E_Cargo Tanks; Qualification and maintenance (andSection;andSection;173.33, 177.824).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Subpart F_Tank Cars; Qualification and maintenance (andSection; 173.31).</ITAG>Only the requirements contained in Subparts A and E are adopted in thisfinal rule. Subpart A contains general requirements pertaining to the continuingqualification and use of packagings set forth in this Part. Subpart E containsrequirements on the maintenance and retesting of DOT specification cargotanks and cargo tanks used under an exemption, and the requirements forcontinuing qualification of a cargo tank as an authorized packaging forhazardous materials. Certain other provisions addressed in Subpart E arethe continued use of existing cargo tanks made to an obsolete specification,and cargo tanks conforming to and used under a DOT exemption containingprovisions that have been incorporated in the HMR. A. Manhole Closures Included in Subpart E are requirements pertaining to features on cargotanks such as the leak-tightness of manhole closures. Proposed andSection;180.405(a) would have required that each cargo tank be equipped with asecure closure on each manhole which is structurally capable of withstandingfor at least 5 minutes, without leakage or permanent deformation, a staticinternal fluid pressure of at least 36 psig or the cargo tank test pressure,whichever is greater. Manhole assemblies on existing cargo tanks not meetingthe proposed requirements would have been required to be retrofitted. Basedon data furnished by a manufacturer, we estimated the cost to retrofitthe affected cargo tanks to be between $20 and $250 per manhole when includedas part of scheduled maintenance and testing. Commenters expressed no objection to the proposal as it relates to manholeclosures on MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks. Regarding MC 306 cargo tanks,commenters stated that requiring the manhole assembly to be structurallycapable of withstanding 36 psig without permanent deformation is unrealisticand would not enhance safety. They stated that TTMA Recommended Practice(RP) No. 61-82, upon which the proposed structural capability requirementwas based, allows some leakage, and deformation that does not affect ladingretention capability. Commenters suggested a revision of the proposal toallow the use of manhole assemblies conforming to TTMA RP No. 61-82. Webelieve that to allow leakage of product from a manhole assembly createsan unsafe condition. Accordingly, as suggested by the commenters, we haverevised proposed andSection; 180.405(g) to adopt provisions consistent witha revised version of TTMA's standard for MC 306 type cargo tanks. Theseprovisions specify no leakage, but allow deformation not affecting ladingretention capability, and specify a quality control testing frequency ofat least one percent (or one manhole closure, whichever is greater) ofall manhole closures of each type produced, every three months. We believethat allowing deformation of the tank without leakage will not affect safety.Commenters stated that we underestimated the cost of retrofitting affectedcargo tanks and that the replacement cost for manholes requiring new collarinstallation could be as much as $1,300. Commenters also stated there aremany cargo tanks equipped with manhole closures conforming to the requiredstructural capability, but which are not certified or marked as conformingto TTMA RP No. 61-82. We agree with commenters that many unmarked manholeclosures conform to this standard. Accordingly, we have revised proposedandSection; 180.407. In those cases where the manufacturer of the manholeclosure has identified and certified a particular model or series of closuresas conforming to TTMA RP No. 61-82, the owner of the cargo tank may certifyand mark the manhole closure in conformance with this standard. Commenterspointed out that, in some cases, the manufacturer of the manhole closuremay not be known, or the manufacturer may not be willing to certify thatthe closure is structurally capable of conforming to the industry standard.To address this problem TTMA proposed a static test procedure for evaluatingthe integrity of existing manhole closures which are not marked and certifiedto RP No. 61-82 by the manufacturer. The test procedure contained in TTMATechnical Bulletin (TB) No. 107 specifies a 15 psig hydrostatic test, whichthe manhole closure must withstand without any evidence of leakage or permanentdeformation. TTMA has submitted data to support its position that a manholeclosure which has been tested in this manner is structurally capable ofwithstanding the 36 psig test without leakage. We believe the test procedurescontained in TTMA TB No. 107 will be adequate in verifying the leak-tightnessof unmarked closures. Accordingly, we are authorizing unmarked manholeclosures that have been successfully tested in conformance with TTMA TechnicalBulletin No. 107 to be marked and certified as conforming to the applicablerequirements as prescribed in the technical bulletin. B. Inspection and Testing The table in proposed andSection; 180.407(c) containing the testing and inspectionschedule for DOT specification cargo tanks is revised for clarity, as suggestedby NTTC. The specific scheduling intervals are adopted essentially unchanged.Several commenters addressed the qualification requirements for personsperforming certain prescribed tests. Commenters objected to the proposalin $ andSection; 180.407 requiring that the periodic pressure retest be performedby, or witnessed and certified by, an Authorized Inspector. Commentersargued that the cost for the use of an Authorized Inspector to witnessor perform the pressure retest is not justified. Several commenters statedthat performing a pressure retest requires less knowledge and skill thanperforming a thorough visual inspection. Several commenters also citedincidents to support their claims that their company employees are as knowledgeableand qualified, if not more so, than some Authorized Inspectors that theyhave employed. As an alternative to the use of an Authorized Inspector,several commenters urged DOT to permit the periodic pressure retest andinspection to be performed by a ``certified'' inspector, e.g., a motorcarrier employee with appropriate training and experience. The NTTC statedthat such training should be specified by DOT and monitored by DOT andstate enforcement agencies. Based on full consideration of the merits ofthese comments the periodic pressure retest may be performed by a qualifiedperson who is registered with the Department under the procedures prescribedin andSection; 180.409. We believe this change will allow more flexibilityin the selection of qualified individuals. Commenters also argued that, in proposed andSection; 180.407(i), the useof persons qualified under the American Society for Nondestructive Testing(ASNT) Level II for ultrasonic testing for the required thickness testsis unnecessary. Commenters pointed out that a Level II Technician is qualifiedto perform ultrasonic examination for weld defects, a far more complicatedprocedure than a thickness measurement. We believe that this comment hasmerit and are requiring, instead of the Level II qualifications, that thetester be trained in the use of the particular thickness testing device,according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the device.C. Bottom Damage Protection_Wet Lines Bottom loading and unloading outlets on cargo tanks, although very useful,present the inherent risk that if damaged the entire contents of the tankmay be released. To counteract this risk the tank outlet, outlet valveand piping are specifically designed to prevent damage to the outlet andoutlet valves that would result in the loss of lading in an accident. Thetank outlet and outlet valve are designed to be nearly flush with the surfaceof the tank. In addition, piping attached to the outlet valve is providedwith a sacrificial device that is designed to break under accident loadsand thereby prevent the piping from causing damage to the outlet valveor tank wall. Because such piping under the current regulation is not specificallya part of the product containment vessel and is designed to fail in anaccident, RSPA's position is that piping between the tank outlet valveand any loading valves is not an appropriate packaging for the transportationof hazardous materials. As a part of the implementation of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA requiredthat cargo tanks used in areas operating under EPA's State ImplementationPlan for the CAA must be equipped with a vapor recovery system. The petroleumindustry chose to use bottom loading in conjunction with tank top vaporrecovery as their method of compliance with the CAA. All motor fuels mustbe metered for tax purposes. Unfortunately, in implementing this systemthe industry did not provide for a way to drain product from the cargotank piping back into the loading facility and maintain proper accountingfor tax purposes. As a result, cargo tanks are currently operated withgasoline in external piping that is designed to fail in an accident. Theoperation of cargo tanks with lading retained in external piping is generallylimited to petroleum distillate fuels metered for road fuel tax purposesand transported in bottom loaded MC 306 type cargo tanks. The scope ofthese operations encompasses the vast majority of all gasoline transported.RSPA strongly believes the practice of transporting hazardous materialsin exposed unprotected piping designed to fail, if impacted in an accident,is an unnecessary risk. Currently this practice is generally limited togasoline transportation; expansion of this practice to other segments ofthe cargo tank transportation industry particularly for material with inherenthazards greater than gasoline is unacceptable. Accordingly, RSPA proposedin the NPRM a prohibition on the transportation of hazardous materialsin external piping unless the piping is protected by very substantial guards.Commenters from the petroleum industry, represented by the American PetroleumInstitute (API) and several large petroleum companies, argued that theneed for bottom damage protection structures to protect piping containinglading is not justified. They argued that, based on statistical data showingthe infrequency of accidents involving these lines, the relatively smallamount of product exposed, and the integrity and operation of current self-closingvalves, the loss of lading from piping is not a significant problem. RSPA agrees that accidents resulting in damage to unprotected externalpiping carrying lading are infrequent, but the consequences of such accidentscan be substantial, particularly if the material released has inherenthazards greater than that of gasoline. For this reason, we have adoptedthe proposal to clarify that, with the exception of gasoline, the transportationof hazardous materials in external unprotected piping is prohibited. Forhazardous materials other than gasoline, transportation in external unprotectedpiping is less common and thus the prohibition of such transportation willhave a much lower cost impact. However, if the transportation of gasolinein external unprotected piping were prohibited, the impact on the petroleumindustry could be substantial. Although we have very serious concerns with the practice of transportinggasoline in external unprotected piping, we do not have sufficient dataregarding incidents that can be attributed to the dislodging of pipingto justify prohibiting the practice for gasoline at this time. Nor do wehave adequate information concerning possible alternative procedures orequipment for accomplishing vapor recovery and road fuel tax metering,and the costs associated with these alternatives. Many of the potentialcost effective ways to eliminate the risk associated with the transportationof gasoline in external unprotected line may entail alterations to thecargo tank piping, fixed loading and unloading equipment, or both. Forthese reasons we are excepting gasoline from the prohibition on the transportationof hazardous materials in external unprotected piping. However, we encouragethe petroleum industry to consider the risk they accept in employing thispractice, and work to eliminate it. We believe the petroleum industry isbest positioned to consider and evaluate all the possible ways to eliminatethis risk in the most cost effective manner. The final rule contains a new provision, at andSection; 173.33(e), whichpermits the retention of fuels in piping outboard of a shear section providedcertain conditions are met. These conditions limit the inside diameterand aggregate volume of all unprotected piping on the cargo tank transportinghazardous materials. The intent of these provisions is to limit the quantityof lading transported and thereby limit the level of risk to current levels.These provisions in andSection; 173.33(e) are limited to fuels metered forroad fuel tax purposes. The retention of any other hazardous material inexternal unprotected piping is prohibited. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Use of Cargo Tanks </ITAG>A. Gasoline_Design Pressure of Cargo Tanks Several commenters addressed the proposal in andSection; 173.33(c) on theapplication of the design pressure formula to gasoline. (See discussionof andSection; 173.33 later in this preamble). In its comments, the AmericanPetroleum Institute (API) pointed out that gasoline is a blend of organicchemicals which have seasonal variations to enhance the efficiency of motorvehicles. For the winter, gasoline is blended with a higher volatility(higher vapor pressure) to ensure engine start up; whereas for the summer,a lower volatility (lower vapor pressure) is blended to prevent vapor lock.As a result of this seasonal blending, gasoline typically marketed in thewinter could not, under the proposal, be transported in the existing fleetof gasoline cargo tanks, because the proposed design pressure formula andreference temperature would require the use of a cargo tank having a designpressure exceeding that of the existing MC 306 cargo tank. API furtherstates that in order to provide uniform automotive performance year-round,the majority of gasoline is blended and marketed in accordance with a consensusstandard, ASTM D439, which would prevent winter gasoline from being shippedduring periods of elevated temperatures approaching 115 anddegrees;F. APIasserts that use of this standard would achieve the same condition soughtunder proposed andSection; 173.33(c). The concluding recommendation fromAPI was that ASTM D439 should be adopted as the safety standard for thetransportation of gasoline. This would be achieved by exempting gasolinegenerally conforming to ASTM D439 from the design pressure formula.At a subsequent public meeting, API provided additional information tosupport its recommendation, including a listing of States with requirementssimilar to ASTM D439, results of a gasoline marketing survey, and calculationssupporting their proposal. The gasoline marketing survey provided by APIdocumented divergence from ASTM D439, and in some cases the maximum allowedReid Vapor Pressure (RVP) specified in ASTM D439 for classes of gasolinewere exceeded. Further, only a few States have regulations requiring compliancewith the ASTM D439 standard. Two States even allow marketing of wintergasoline with RVP's greater than 16 psia, which is not authorized for transportin MC 306 cargo tanks nor is it in compliance with ASTM D439. Based oncomments and information we have received on ASTM D439, it is clear thatthe standard: (a) is a marketing standard designed towards consumer's satisfactionwith automotive performance; (b) is not a safety standard; and (c) is notwidely recognized by States nor strictly followed by shippers of gasoline.However, the general concept that winter gasoline should not be marketedin the summer forms the basis for our modifying the proposed design pressurerequirement (herein an MAWP requirement) for gasoline transported in cargotanks equipped with a 1 psig normal vent. In this final rule, in orderfor a hazardous material to be transported in a cargo tank equipped witha 1 psig normal vent, the sum of the tank static head and 1 psig (the maximumvapor pressure exerted by the lading) must be less than or equal to theMAWP of the cargo tank. In addition, the vapor pressure of the lading at115 anddegrees;F must be no greater than 1 psig. An exception from the vaporpressure limit is granted for gasoline under certain circumstances. A maximumambient and lading temperature table appears in andSection; 173.119(a)(17)(iii)in the final rule. The table prescribes the maximum ambient and ladingtemperature for the transportation of each class of gasoline and generallyrecognizes ASTM D439, as was recommended by API. This table is derivedfrom the ASTM D439 gasoline class definitions, API technical documentationfor the conversion of Reid Vapor Pressure to normal vapor pressure, anda revision of the maximum allowable working pressure equation appearingin proposed andSection; 173.33(c). The derivation process involved calculationof the maximum ambient temperature for each ASTM D439 class of gasolinethat would not exceed a 1 psig pressure measured at the top of the tank.Pressures in excess of 1 psig will be relieved by the 1 psig normal vent,which vents predominantly air. (See discussion on andSection; 178.346). Whileensuring adequate pressure capability of the cargo tank for each classof gasoline, use of the table will not prevent the transportation of anygasoline blended in accordance with ASTM D439. B. Smaller Capacity Cargo Tanks in Flammable Liquid Service The NPRM contained a proposal to remove, at andSection; 177.824(a), an exceptionfor cargo tanks with a capacity of 3,000 gallons or less used exclusivelyin flammable liquid service from inspection and periodic retest requirements.Most of these are MC 306 type cargo tanks. Comments from the petroleummarketing industry (i.e., distributors of gasoline, fuels and other petroleumproducts), took strong exception to the proposal. Many commenters supportedthe comments filed by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA).PMAA stated, in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">Contrary to DOT's assertion, these smaller vehicles are not ``operatedunder similar conditions, and operated over the same roads * * * as typical4000 to 8000 gallon cargo tanks motor vehicles.'' Rather, these smallervehicles are generally used in less populated, and therefore, less exposed,rural areas to deliver product intrastate to small accounts with an averagetank capacity of between 500-1000 gallons. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While PMAA agrees that ``periodic maintenance, inspection and retestingof any vehicle transporting hazardous material must be an integral partof any responsible operator's safety management program,'' DOT offers noevidence to show that owners of these vehicles do not already engage inperiodic maintenance or that these vehicles present a hazard to the public.These vehicles are already subject to state regulations and local ordinancedesigned to meet community safety concerns, some of which may be more stringentthan federal requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Elimination of the small vehicle exemption will subject smallbusiness marketers to dual, and perhaps triple, regulation under federal,state and local requirements. Compliance with several layers of regulationswill make it impractical, if not impossible for these small businessesto continue to supply the farm and bulk end user accounts solely dependentupon the largely rural network of marketers for their petroleum requirements.</ITAG>RSPA acknowledges that information is not readily available on the typeof periodic maintenance being performed by owners of these smaller cargotanks. Several commenters asserted that they already perform periodic maintenanceand inspection of their smaller cargo tanks and, therefore, the proposalto subject these vehicles to periodic inspections is unnecessary. One commenterasserted that their vehicles are inspected annually by State fire marshalsand, therefore, the exception should be retained. However, we believe thatfew State and local agencies have enacted regulations governing the maintenanceand testing of smaller cargo tanks. We find that many States have adoptedor incorporated the HMR as a part of their laws, including the exceptiongranted for smaller cargo tanks operating exclusively in flammable liquidservice. We believe that a cargo tank containing 3000 gallons of a flammable liquidpresents a significant risk to the public. Furthermore, we believe thatcitizens in rural as well as urban areas must be provided protection fromthat risk. Many state public safety representatives have supported thisproposal. The proposed requirement that the retest be performed or witnessedby an Authorized Inspector, as discussed earlier in this preamble, is notadopted in this final rule. Similarly, the proposal to require all repairsto pressure parts on cargo tanks be performed or witnessed by an AuthorizedInspector is not adopted in this final rule. These changes will alleviatecommenters' concerns regarding potential cost increases in those areas.We believe that if the commenters' assertions that periodic maintenance,inspections, and repairs are presently being performed on these tanks aretrue, there should be minimal incremental costs to small businesses. Thefinal rule contains requirements for the periodic maintenance, inspection,and retest of all cargo tanks.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Impact of this Rulemaking on Existing Exemptions </ITAG>A number of cargo tanks are being operated under exemption. It is our intentionthat, to the maximum extent appropriate, existing cargo tanks authorizedfor use under an outstanding exemption be covered under this rule, therebyeliminating the need for the exemption. It is our position, however, thatin order to be re-marked as a specification cargo tank, an existing cargotank must, as a minimum, meet the basic provisions in this rule. Accordingly, each owner or manufacturer of a cargo tank which is used inthe transportation of liquid hazardous materials should examine the tankand the tank drawings to determine if the cargo tank meets the requirementsof the applicable MC 306, MC 307 or MC 312 cargo tank specification ineffect at the time of manufacture and the conditions prescribed in theapplicable DOT exemption. The owner of a cargo tank meeting the applicablerequirements should remove the DOT exemption number stenciled on the cargotank and mark the identification plate (or a plate placed adjacent to thespecification plate) as specified by andSection; 180.407(f)(6) accordingto the applicable specification. A copy of the exemption in effect at thetime the cargo tank is remarked must be retained on file at the owner'sprincipal place of business during the period the cargo tank is in service,and for at least one year thereafter. DOT exemptions that may be affectedby this rulemaking are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="44"/><T3>Hazardous waste tanks </T3><ITAG tagnum="42">3095 </ITAG><P>5701 </P><P>6325 </P><P>7476 </P><P>7948 </P><P>8213 </P><P>8269 </P><P>8337 </P><P>8348 </P><P>8408 </P><P>8426 </P><P>8478 </P><P>8518 </P><P>8549 </P><P>8551 </P><P>8552 </P><P>8620 </P><P>8640 </P><P>8706 </P><P>8742 </P><P>8751 </P><P>8761 </P><P>8822 </P><P>8844 </P><P>8904 </P><P>9143 </P><P>9463 </P><P>9486 </P><P>9512 </P><P>9515 </P><P>9536 </P><P>9543 </P><P>9568</P><ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Delayed Effective Dates </ITAG>Delayed effective dates are found in the following sections to providefor a smooth transition from the existing requirements to the new requirements:1. Section 180.405_Authorizes the construction of DOT Specification MC306, MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks conforming to the applicable specificationrequirements in effect on June 12, 1989 until December 12, 1990. 2. Section 180.413_Authorizes the repair of DOT Specification MC 300, MC301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, and MC 306 cargo tanks, and non ASME MC 304,MC 307, MC 310, MC 311 and MC 312 cargo tanks by persons who do not presentlyhold an ASME or National Board Certificate of Authorization until December12, 1990.3. Section 180.405(g)_Allows owners of existing cargo tanks with manholeassemblies not meeting the requirements of andSection; 178.345-5 until June13, 1994 to retrofit the manhole assemblies. 4. Sections 178.345-10 and 180.405(h)_Require that after June 12, 1991any reclosing pressure relief valve installed on a cargo tank must be capableof reseating to a leak-tight condition. 5. Section 178.345-10_Requires that each pressure relief system on a DOTSpecification 406, 407 or 412 cargo tank be designed to withstand a dynamicpressure surge of 50 psig applied for at least 300 milliseconds withoutleakage of liquid regardless of vehicle orientation after June 13, 1994.Review by Section Readers are reminded that this review by section discusses only significantcomments on the proposals in the NPRM and changes made to the NPRM in thisFinal Rule. For those provisions that are unchanged, readers are referredto the preamble discussion in the original NPRM (50 FR 37766) and subsequentcorrection document (50 FR 49866). <T3>Sections 107.501-107.504.</T3> These new sections contain registrationrequirements for persons engaged in the manufacture, assembly, certification,inspection or repair of DOT specification cargo tanks or cargo tank motorvehicles, and cargo tanks manufactured under exemption. Section 107.502contains general registration requirements applicable to manufacturers,assemblers, repair facilities, and other persons who perform the specifiedfunctions. Section 107.503 contains information on completing a registrationstatement. This section also grants an exception from requirements foran ASME Certificate of Authorization for assemblers of cargo tanks whoperform no welding on the cargo tank wall. Section 107.504 contains provisionson required documentation, required updates of registration information,and procedures for renewal. See earlier discussion in this preamble underthe heading ``Cargo tank; Manufacturer Qualification, Registration, QualityControl, and Certification.''  <T3>Section 171.3.</T3> Proposed andSection; 171.3(f)(1) would have authorizedthe continued use of nonspecification cargo tank motor vehicles for transportationof hazardous wastes in intrastate commerce under certain conditions. Uponfurther consideration, we realized that these tanks, which are not underexemption, are used only to transport waste materials that do not requirethe use of a DOT specification cargo tank. Therefore, the proposed provisionis unnecessary and is not adopted in this rule. <T3>Section 171.7. </T3>Several commenters requested that matter incorporatedby reference not be identified by a specific edition number or date. Thecommenters stated that the absence of dated material would allow personsto use the most recently published edition of incorporated standards withoutdelay and would eliminate the need for RSPA to publish periodic updatesof incorporated matter in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Director of the Federal Register (OFR) hasthe responsibility for approval of materials incorporated by referenceinto the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Thus, OFR regulations require an agency thatseeks approval for a change to a publication that is approved for incorporationby reference must publish notice of the change in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and amend the Code of Federal Regulations. Thelanguage incorporating a publication by reference must state the title,date, edition, author, publisher, and identification number of the publication.See approval procedures for incorporation by reference in l CFR Part 51.The proposed changes to reflect the new address of the American WeldingSociety (AWS), to revise the reference numbering of the AWS Code, and toincorporate the latest editions of the American Boiler and Pressure VesselCode and CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 were handled in other separate rulemakingactions. The change to incorporate the Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) TechnicalBulletin 13 is not adopted. The provisions contained in RMA Technical Bulletin13 that were to be referenced are brief and, thus, are adopted in the rule.Also the change to incorporate the American Society for NondestructiveTesting Standard for use by persons who perform ultrasonic thickness testingon cargo tanks is not adopted in this rule. See preamble discussion toandSection; 180.409. <T3>Section 171.8.</T3> The definitions for ``Authorized Inspector,'' ``AuthorizedInspection Agency,'' and ``Cargo tank motor vehicle,'' are adopted as proposed.The proposed definition for ``cargo tank'' as a tank with a capacity ofover 110 gallons is revised to provide consistency with the definitionof a ``bulk packaging.'' A bulk packaging is defined in andSection; 171.8to mean a packaging with a capacity of greater than 118.9 gallons if usedfor a liquid. Since a cargo tank is considered a bulk packaging, this changeeliminates discrepancies between the two definitions for tanks with a capacitybetween 110 gallons and 118.9 gallons. In addition, in the cargo tank definition,references are added to refer to the definitions of ``tank'' appearingin the MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tank specifications, in andSection;andSection;178.337-1 and 178.338-1, respectively, and new definitions are added for``Registered Inspector'' and ``Design certifying engineer.''<T3>Section 172.203. </T3>Paragraph (h) is amended to correct referencesto provisions contained in andSection; 173.315. <T3>Section 173.33. </T3>Proposed paragraph (a)(2) is revised, as suggestedby NTTC and the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), to make boththe shipper and the carrier responsible for ensuring the compatibilityof materials that are offered or loaded for transportation in a cargo tankmotor vehicle. The CMA stated, ``For customer pickup shipments, where acargo tank in a multi-compartmental motor vehicle already contains a materialwhen arriving at a shipper's facility, it should be the responsibilityof the receiver (motor carrier) to ensure that mixture of the materialswill not create an unsafe condition. A shipper may not be familiar withthe characteristics of the chemical which is already contained in one ormore of the cargo tanks in a multi-compartmental vehicle.'' RSPA agreeswith the commenters that, in a case where a motor carrier receives hazardousmaterials from different shippers, the responsibility for ensuring an unsafecondition is not generated, should be a shared responsibility and not theexclusive responsibility of the shipper or the carrier. Accordingly, paragraph(a)(2) has been revised to provide that ``two or more materials may notbe loaded or accepted for transportation. . . .'' Proposed paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) are revised to clarify that a cargotank may not be loaded with any hazardous materials that may produce anunsafe condition. A commenter objected to proposed paragraph (b)(4) which would require thatthe rate used to load or unload a cargo tank be less than or equal to therate marked on the cargo tank specification plate. The commenter statedthat a proposed requirement would have no effect if the manhole is openor if the closed system is protected by the pressure relief devices. Wedo not agree with the commenter. The use of a loading rate exceeding themaximum loading rate may lead to possible over pressurization and tankrupture in addition to leakage of lading through relief valves. In addition,we have revised proposed paragraph (b)(4) to specify the maximum pressurethat may be used during loading and unloading when the loading/unloadingrate is not marked on the cargo tank specification plate. Proposed paragraph (c) would have required that prior to filling and offeringa hazardous material for transportation, a shipper must confirm that thedesign pressure of the cargo tank is greater than or equal to 120 percentof the sum of the vapor pressure of the lading at 115 anddegrees;F, the tankstatic head exerted by the lading, and any pressure exerted by the gaspadding, including air, in the ullage space or dome. As is discussed laterin this preamble (see discussion of andSection; 178.345-1), the term ``maximumallowable working pressure'' (MAWP) has replaced the term ``design pressure''in this final rule. The term MAWP will be used for the remainder of thisdiscussion for consistency with the final rule. Commenters argued thatthe proposed formula is too restrictive, and would require a higher MAWPthan is necessary for the commodity to be shipped, particularly for gasolineshipped in MC 306-type cargo tanks. These commenters suggested that eitherthe safety factor of 1.2 or the vapor pressure reference temperature bereduced in order to present a more realistic approach. Additionally, commenterspointed out that the ASME Code provides a 4 to 1 factor of safety in thestructural design of cargo tanks, eliminating the need for an additionalsafety factor in the MAWP equation. We agree that a cargo tank constructed to the ASME Code or to the HMR isstructurally designed with a substantial factor of safety. We are alsoaware that the use of a vapor pressure reference temperature of 115 anddegrees;Fis the extreme of what is experienced in normal transportation. However,we are concerned about the possible loss of hazardous materials ladingfrom a cargo tank involved in an accident involving a rollover. Under proposedandSection; 178.340-10, safety relief valves would be set at the MAWP, andreclose at 90% of the set pressure. We believe that a safety factor mustbe included to ensure that the static head and vapor pressure of the lading,in addition to any gas padding in the tank, do not cause the relief valvesto open in a rollover situation, and release product continuously withoutreseating. The intent of the NPRM was to link the properties of the lading to thestructural design of the tank and to the relief device settings. Our primaryconcern in relating a potential lading to the cargo tank MAWP is in thesettings of the pressure relief valves, as discussed above, since an adequatefactor of safety is included in the structural design of the tank itself.As a result of the written comments received and the public meetings held,we have modified the maximum allowable working pressure requirements inthe final rule. This final rule requires an MAWP greater than or equalto 100 percent of the sum of the vapor pressure of the lading at 115 anddegrees;F,plus the tank static head of the lading, plus the pressure exerted by anygas padding. The 20 percent safety cushion has been removed from the calculationof the MAWP where it results in increased wall thickness; but it has beenretained in the pressure relief valve settings. The final rule requiresthat the primary pressure relief valve setting be no less than 120 percentof the MAWP of the tank, determined as described above.It was not our intention in proposed paragraph (c) to change the existingpressure relief and venting requirements of cargo tanks used to transportcompressed gases, including cryogenic liquids. This error has been correctedin the final rule.Proposed paragraph (c)(4) would have required the use of a cargo tank motorvehicle having a design pressure of 25 psig or higher for any materialthat meets the definition of more than one hazard class. It was our intentin the NPRM to require a higher integrity tank for dual hazard materials,and to specifically exclude the MC 306 cargo tank from use in transportingflammable liquids that also meet the definition of a corrosive. However,the proposal would also have excluded MC 312 cargo tanks in the pressurerange of 15-25 psig. Some commenters questioned the necessity of the requiredminimum pressure for low vapor pressure, high flash point (such as UN PackagingGroup III) materials, while other commenters expressed support for theproposed change. This proposal has not been adopted in this final rule.However, it will be given further consideration under a separate rulemakingaction (Docket HM 181). The NPRM contained proposals to standardize certain commodity requirementsand eliminate several discrepancies in the requirements for transportingcertain kinds of commodities in DOT specification cargo tanks. For example,it was proposed to require that all cargo tanks used to transport poisonousmaterials have a design pressure of 25 psig and to prohibit the use ofnon-reclosing pressure relief devices (except when in series with a reclosingrelief valve) on cargo tanks transporting flammable liquids. The NPRM wasnot intended to be an extensive review and possible reclassification ofthose hazardous materials authorized to be shipped in cargo tanks. On May 5, 1987, RSPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking under DocketHM-181, entitled ``Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards; MiscellaneousProposals''. Among other things, the proposal called for the adoption ofan internationally recognized classification system for hazardous materialsand the placement of hazardous materials into groups of bulk packagingswhich provide equivalent levels of packaging integrity. The present packagingsections for the bulk transportation of hazardous materials were adoptedon a piecemeal basis over the years. In some sections, materials with similartransportation hazards are not authorized in similar bulk packagings dueto oversight or because the industry did not petition the DOT to authorizethem. Specifically, the proposal would allow a hazardous material thatcan safely be carried in one type of cargo tank to be carried in all cargotanks of similar or greater integrity. Additionally, the proposal wouldrequire bulk packagings of much greater integrity than presently requiredfor materials that are toxic by inhalation. This final rule does not addressany of the issues raised in Docket HM-181. For the above stated reason, RSPA has not accepted a commenter's recommendationthat a new provision be added to provide that whenever an MC 300, MC 301,MC 302, MC 305 or MC 306 cargo tank is authorized, the use of an MC 307,MC 312 or MC 331 cargo tank having an equal or higher marked design pressurebe authorized. The use of a higher integrity tank in place of a currentlyauthorized specification tank is being considered under a separate rulemaking(Docket HM-181) and, therefore, has not been made a part of this finalrule. The public and regulated industry should be aware that the finalrule promulgated under Docket HM-181 might have significant impact on commoditiesauthorized to be transported in DOT specification cargo tanks in the future.<T3>Section 173.119. </T3>For discussion of the substantive changes affectingthis section, refer to the preamble discussions under the heading ``Useof Cargo Tank'' and the discussion of changes to andSection; 178.346. <T3>Sections 173.135 and 173.136. </T3>A commenter suggested that transportationsafety could be enhanced by authorizing only MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanksfor use in transporting the named chlorosilanes under this section. Thissame commenter requested that RSPA amend the provisions in this sectionto provide for the transportation of dimethyl chlorosilane in MC 330 andMC 331 cargo tanks The commenter presented no data to support these morerestrictive provisions nor is RSPA aware of any problems with the use ofthe cargo tanks authorized. RSPA will give this matter further considerationshould information be received to support the change. <T3>Section 173.154. </T3>A provision is added in proposed paragraph (a)(4)to specify the requirements for prsssure relief devices on MC 310, MC 311,MC 312 and DOT 412 cargo tanks, which was inadvertently omitted from thissection. <T3>Section 173.240. </T3>NTTC recommended that RSPA amend andSection; 173.240by revising the definition of a ``corrosive material'' and the test requirements.NTTC stated, in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe that the regulatory testing of ``corrosive materials''(at Section 173.240) must be changed. It bears little relevance to transportationpractices; has been outdated by contemporary testing and analytical technology;and has [led] to premature deterioration of even newly-manufactured cargotanks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current mandated tests allow the manufacturer of a corrosive totest under one set of circumstances and then offer the product for transportationunder another. For example, the manufacturer may conduct the corrosivetest with a product at a temperature of 70 degrees F. at a specified concentrationwhile loading it aboard a cargo tank at 95 degrees F. and at a significantlydifferent concentration. Metallurgists inform us that chemicals may besubstantially more aggressive to tank parent and weld metal at a highertemperature. Such would accelerate internal corrosion, pitting, and (particularly)intergranular cracking.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Although NTTC's recommendation has merit, the suggested corrosivematerial definition and test criteria are beyond the scope of this rulemaking and, therefore, has not been made a part of this rule. However,this matter may be considered under a rulemaking action in the future.<T3>Section 173.247. </T3>A commenter requested a revision to authorizesilicon chloride for transportation under andSection; 173.280 instead ofandSection; 173.247. The commenter stated that this change would simplifythe HMR and enhance safety. In the comments made to andSection; 178.280,the commenter suggested that RSPA change the section heading from ``Trichlorosilanes''to ``Nonflammable Chlorosilanes (including silicon chloride)''. The commenterstated that this change would provide for these chemicals to be more rationallygrouped for appropriate packaging in MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks. Thecommenter provided no reason for this more restrictive provision. Withoutdata to support these changes, no action has been taken under this finalrule. <T3>Section 173.252. </T3>A commenter disagreed with the clarificationcontained in proposed paragraph (a)(4) stating that the prescribed \3/8\inch minimum thickness for the tank shell and head excludes any lining,cladding or corrosion allowance. The commenter stated that the existingregulations required that each tank must have a head and shell thicknessof at least \3/8\ inch and a nickel cladding on the inside surface comprisingat least 20 percent of the total thickness. RSPA also received a letterrequesting clarification of the provision. In the reply, RSPA agreed that(1) where cladding is required by andSection; 173.252(a)(4), the thicknessof the cladding is based on a percentage of the minimum calculated shellthickness rather than the as-built thickness if the shell is thicker thanrequired, and (2) the word ``shell'' as mentioned in andSection; 173.252(a)(4)means the total thickness of steel plus nickel. In any case the steel portionof the composite shell must conform to the material, minimum thicknessand structural integrity requirements of the applicable cargo tank specification.The composite steel/nickel plate must conform to the requirements of ASTMspecification A-265-69. The final rule has been revised consistent withthis clarification. <T3>Section 173.264. </T3>In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to include a provisionfound in Note 1 to paragraph (a)(14) that authorized inhibited hydrofluoricacid solution of 60 percent to 65 percent concentrations in unlined cargotanks. A commenter stated that 60 percent to 65 percent hydrofluoric acidis no longer being produced and, therefore, continuing to grant the provisionis unnecessary. The commenter also pointed out that the Manufacturing ChemistsAssociation had filed a petition (P-440) seeking removal of the provision.Although not a part of the proposal, RSPA believes the request has meritand it is adopted in paragraph (a)(14) of this final rule. The commenter also requested that we prohibit the use of bottom outletson cargo tanks authorized under this section and andSection; 173.265(a)(4).The commenter presented no data to support this change. RSPA is not awareof any safety problems with the use of bottom outlets on cargo tanks authorizedunder this section. In the absence of data to support the change, no actionis being taken at this time. <T3>Section 173.265. </T3>The proposed change to paragraph (a)(4) is correctedto apply to paragraph (b)(4) in the final rule. <T3>Section 173.266. </T3>Proposed paragraph (r)(2) would have removeda provision that designs for venting and pressure relief devices be examinedby the Bureau of Explosives and approved by the Director, OHMT. A commenterrequested that the provision be retained to keep the continuous vent arrangement.RSPA did not intend to remove this provision and this proposal has notbeen adopted. <T3>Section 173.273. </T3>A commenter stated that the wording ``and consistingof a spring-loaded pressure relief valve'' in proposed paragraph (a)(5)(i)implies that a frangible disc in series is prohibited. The commenter statedthat the use of a frangible disc should be allowed to protect the spring-loadedvalve and to provide additional containment. As an alternative, the commenterrequested that the wording be removed, as proposed andSection; 178.340-10(andSection; 178.345-10 as adopted herein) requires the use of a spring-loadedpressure relief valve and allows the use of a frangible disc in series.We agree with the commenter and have revised paragraph (a)(5) accordingly.We have also revised proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) to allow the settingof a spring-loaded valve in series with a frangible disc at 125 percentof design pressure instead of 150 percent of design pressure. <T3>Section 173.315. </T3>Paragraph (i) is revised to permit safety reliefvalves to be certified by the valve manufacturer in place of an AuthorizedInspector. Existing andSection; 173.33(k), which requires that MC 330 cargo tanks usedto transport certain gases be equipped with liquid discharge controls conformingto andSection; 178.337-11(c) at each liquid discharge opening, would havebeen removed and placed in new paragraph (n) of this section. Proposedparagraph (n) would have required that each vapor or liquid discharge openingon MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks be equipped as prescribed in proposedandSection; 178.337-11. Several commenters expressed concern that, as proposed,these tanks would have to be retrofitted with internal valves on the vaporopenings. It was not our intention to make any substantive change in thespecification requirements for these tanks. Accordingly, the referenceto the vapor discharge opening is removed.<T3>Section 173.318. </T3>Consistent with other changes to the final ruleand the reformatting of this section under a separate rulemaking, paragraphs(b)(2)(i) and (ii) are revised to require that the flow capacity and ratingof pressure relief devices be verified and certified by the manufacturerof the device. <T3>Section 173.346. </T3>A commenter requested a revision of proposedparagraph (a)(12) to authorize the continued use of a MC 306 cargo tankwith a capacity of 3,000 gallons or less when operated by private carrierto transport formulated agricultural chemicals meeting the definition ofPoison B. The transportation of Poison B materials was discussed in thepreamble of the NPRM, and requires a cargo tank with a MAWP of 25 psig.We believe an MC 306 cargo tank is not adequate for the transportationof Poison B n.o.s. materials. Therefore, the final rule is adopted as proposed.<T3>Sections 177.801 and 177.802. </T3>Section 177.801 is revised for clarity.After further consideration, we believe the provisions concerning the inspectionof carrier facilities and records in proposed andSection; 177.802(a), (b)and (c) are redundant. The provisions contained in paragraph (a) are adoptedin this rule. We proposed that the reporting and recordkeeping requirements presentlyfound in andSection; 177.824 be relocated to andSection; 180.417. However,the provision in andSection; 177.824(f) requiring motor carriers to filea report with FHWA listing all MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tanks in service,or being placed in or removed from service, was not included or discussedin the proposed rule. In the NPRM, the present requirement that motor carriersoperating an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in anhydrous ammonia service mustcomplete a written report after testing and inspection was expanded toinclude cargo tanks motor vehicles operating in liquefied petroleum gasor any other service that may cause stress corrosion cracking of the tank.Therefore, we believe the reporting requirements appearing in present andSection;177.824(f) are no longer necessary, and they are not included in this finalrule. <T3>Section 178.320 General requirements applicable to all DOT specificationcargo tanks. </T3>This new section contains general provisions pertainingto all DOT specification cargo tanks, including those used for compressedgases. Included are definitions of ``manufacturer'' and ``design type.''As is discussed elsewhere in this document, the requirement that all cargotanks be constructed and certified in conformance with the ASME Code isnot adopted in this final rule. Independent inspection and certificationof cargo tank design and construction by an Authorized Inspector is notrequired. The absence of independent review of each cargo tank by an AuthorizedInspector has made necessary a new provision in andSection; 178.320 whichrequires each design type (as defined in this section) be certified bya ``Design Certifying Engineer'' (as defined in andSection; 171.8). Designcertification by a qualified individual will ensure the integrity of acargo tank design without requiring independent design review of each individualcargo tank. <T3>Sections 178.337-3 and 178.338-3. </T3>Commenters emphasized that theNPRM proposed parameters for the determination of structural integritywould require cargo tanks with walls up to 25% thicker than presently required.The intent was not to increase the minimum wall thickness requirements.The parameters in this final rule are as follows: <T3>For MC 331 cargo tanks. </T3>The stress values used are the same asthat suggested in our research findings and recommendations. Further, forthe dynamic pressure condition resulting from a deceleration of 2 g's incombination with the MAWP, the design stress value used for wall thicknesscalculations will be the lesser of the tank material's yield strength or75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material <T3>For MC 338 cargo tanks. </T3>The stress values used will be the sameas that proposed for the MC 331, except that the ``g'' loads used willbe those found in andSection; 178.338-13.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In andSection; 178.337-3(d), a requirement which was inadvertently omittedwould be restored as paragraph (3). <T3>Section 178.345-1 (proposed andSection; 178.340-1) General Requirements.</T3>Several commenters objected to the use of the term ``design pressure''throughout the general sections as well as in sections containing the individualcargo tank specifications. These commenters, including TTMA and the FruehaufCorporation, suggested that the term ``maximum allowable working pressure(MAWP)'' should be used. Commenters, at the public meetings held betweenthe DOT and commenters, argued that an MC 306 cargo tank (DOT 406 herein),which is generally an oval cross-section tank not constructed in accordancewith the ASME Code, is not ``designed'' through a series of calculations.Rather, the integrity of an MC 306 cargo tank is verified by hydrostatictest, and the use of the term ``design pressure'' for the MC 306 cargotank is inaccurate. Further, commenters stated that use of the term ``MAWP''maintains consistency with the ASME Code. It should be noted that the ASMECode uses both the terms ``design pressure'' and ``MAWP.'' However, itis the MAWP which is used in the general structural design and pressurerating of the tank. We understand cargo tank manufacturers' reluctance to use the term ``designpressure,'' which is the term used in the existing cargo tank specification.Accordingly, the term ``MAWP'' is used in the final rule in place of theterm ``design pressure.'' The MAWP is the pressure used in the design ofthe cargo tank in the ASME Code and the individual cargo tank specifications.However, a shipper still must determine that the MAWP of a particular cargotank is appropriate for the shipment of a commodity, as required by andSection;173.33. <T3>Section 178.345-2 (proposed andSection; 178.340-2) Material and materialthickness. </T3>Several commenters requested, in addition to materialsconforming to Section II, Parts A and B of the ASME Code, that materialsconforming to ASTM standards be authorized for the construction of DOTspecification cargo tanks. Specifically, TTMA listed two ASTM steel specifications,A676 and A715, and several aluminum alloy specifications for consideration.The aluminum alloy specifications that were listed are authorized in theHMR, and are suitable for use. We believe the two ASTM steel specificationsare also suitable for use. Therefore, we have authorized those materialsas well. Commenters objected to a proposal to use a formula in place of the tablesappearing in the current regulations to determine the minimum requiredthickness of a cargo tank shell or head. Commenters argued that it is easierto verify compliance with the specification requirements through the useof a table. TTMA, in its comments, requested that the thickness tablesbe retained in the individual specifications, with certain changes suchas specifying the thickness by the use of decimals in place of fractionsof inches or gauge designations. TTMA's revised thickness tables were derivedbased on the knowledge and experience of the cargo tank manufacturers inits membership, rather than on specific calculations based on anticipatedstress levels. We agree that the minimum thickness tables are easier to use than a formula.The use of minimum thickness tables can also prevent unusual situationssuch as a cargo tank designed with a very thin shell, but with enough ringstiffeners to meet the maximum allowable stress level requirements. However,we believe that the minimum required thickness of a cargo tank shell orhead must take into account the maximum allowable stress levels. We foundthat the thicknesses in the tables presented by TTMA were generally adequateonly to accommodate the stresses due to internal pressure. Consequently,the minimum thickness tables are being retained in the individual specifications;however, the values appearing in these tables must be replaced by the resultsof the stress calculations of andSection; 178.345-3 if those calculationsrequire a greater thickness. The tables, which are revisions of the tablesdeveloped by TTMA, have been greatly simplified, and the thickness tablesfor the DOT 412 cargo tank are expanded to include product densities of16 to 26 pounds per gallon. The minimum thicknesses for cargo tank shellsand heads listed in the tables are equal to or somewhat greater than thoselisted in the current regulations. <T3>Section 178.345-3 (proposed andSection; 178.340-3) Structural integrity.</T3>The principal comments received on the structural integrity requirementscame from the TTMA and its members. In addition to written comments, severalpublic working meetings were held between representatives of the DOT andTTMA. TTMA agreed that provisions for structural integrity based on g-loadingswere needed for low pressure cargo tanks. However, they stated that theproposed g-loadings were too great. Commenters argued that, although thepreamble to the NPRM specifically stated that no increases in the shellthickness of cargo tanks were intended by the rulemaking, the proposedg-loadings would nearly double the required shell and head thicknesses.The g-loadings recommended by TTMA were: 1.7-g vertical, based on verticalroad shocks and ANSI recommendations; and 0.75-g longitudinal, based onthe maximum expected deceleration. TTMA also stated that a realistic lateralforce would be 0.4-g, which research has proven is the force necessaryto cause overturn.The proposed g-loadings are the same as those specified for the MC 330and MC 331 cargo tanks, since all cargo tanks experience the same over-the-road loading conditions. Commenters stated that the g-loadings for thosehigh pressure cargo tanks were set artificially high in order to add morethickness to the tanks, and that the loadings recommended by the commentershave worked successfully for many years. Further, commenters pointed outthat the ASME design requirements already include a 4 to 1 factor of safety.We agree that the g-loadings recommended by TTMA, combined with the factorof safety required by the ASME Code, will ensure that cargo tanks are designedwith adequate structural integrity. These loadings of 1.7-g vertical, 0.75-glongitudinal, and 0.4-g lateral are adopted in this final rule. With regards to the evaluation of specific stresses, TTMA opposed the proposedrequirement to include, in the design of heads and shell, the load resultingfrom the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resultingfrom a longitudinal deceleration of 2 ``g.'' TTMA stated that such a requirementwould eliminate oval cross section tanks, and that the tank would not experiencethis type of loading in normal transportation. This requirement was proposedin order to account for accident conditions in which such loadings couldoccur. However, we believe that since this load combination would onlyoccur during an accident situation, and would not ordinarily be experiencedin transportation, a lower factor of safety, and a higher allowable stresscould be allowed in the design for the loading. Therefore, in the finalrule, the MAWP in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting froma longitudinal deceleration of 2 ``g'' may not exceed the lesser of theyield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the materialof construction. TTMA further stated that the shear stresses described in proposed andSection;178.340-3(b) (6), (7), and (8) need not be calculated or taken into account,since the effective stress calculated by the formula in proposed andSection;178.340-3(c) (andSection; 178.345-3(c) herein) is governed by the tensileand compressive stresses described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (5).TTMA stated that the calculated shear stresses are much lower than thetensile and compressive stresses. Additionally, TTMA and other commenterspointed out that a calculation of the tensile or compressive stress resultingfrom accelerative and decelerative forces applied at the horizontal pivotof the fifth wheel, as described in proposed andSection; 178.345-3(b)(4),is unnecessary, as this result will not exceed that calculated under proposedparagraph (b)(3). We agree that in most cases, the stress levels will belargely governed by the tensile and compressive stresses. However, sinceshear stresses in addition to accelerative and decelerative forces at thefifth wheel, are also experienced by the cargo tank motor vehicle in transportation,we believe that they must be evaluated as part of the design. <T3>Section 178.345-5 (proposed andSection; 178.340-5) Manhole Assemblies.</T3>Commenters objected to the proposed requirement that manhole closuresbe capable of withstanding, without leakage or permanent deformation, staticinternal fluid pressure of 36 psig or test pressure, whichever is greater.These commenters recommended that we should allow de minimis leakage anddeformation that does not affect the structural integrity of the closures.Commenters stated that if deformation of the tank were allowed, then manholeassemblies conforming to the industry consensus standard TTMA RP No. 61-82could be used. We believe that a leak-tight condition is necessary. Toallow a certain amount of leakage would open the question of how much leakageis acceptable, and how that amount of leakage can be accurately measured.However, we believe that to allow deformation that does not affect thestructural integrity of the cargo tank should not adversely affect safety.TTMA has developed a revised RP. No 61-89, which specifies no leakage,but allows some deformation. The revised standard also contains a requirementfor testing every 3 months, one percent (or one manhole closure, whicheveris greater) of all manhole closures of each type produced to verify compliancewith this requirement. Provisions consistent with those found in revisedTTMA RP No. 61-89 are being adopted for use in andSection; 178.345-5 in thisfinal rule. <T3>Section 178.345-7 (proposed andSection; 178.340-7) Circumferential reinforcements.</T3>The proposal would have required that all ring stiffeners conformto the ASME Code. Several commenters pointed out that the ASME Code requirementsfor ring stiffeners apply only to tanks under external pressure. We agreewith the commenters that the ASME Code does not address ring stiffenersfor tanks under internal pressure. Therefore, the existing requirementsfor ring stiffeners are retained under this final rule. This rule alsoallows ring stiffeners to be placed farther apart than 60 inches for vacuum-loadedtanks under certain conditions. The NPRM contained a proposal to prohibit the use of hat shaped or openchannel rings precluding visual inspection of the tank shell. Most commentersagreed that hat shaped or open channel rings should be prohibited on cargotanks constructed of carbon steel which are used to transport corrosivematerials, but did not believe that such rings should be prohibited oncargo tanks constructed of other materials or transporting other than corrosivematerials. They argued that the proposal would require the use of ``T''rings which are more susceptible to damage in a rollover accident whereskidding is involved. They further stated that ``T'' rings create higherconcentrated stress on the tank shell, which could lead to tearing of theshell and catastrophic loss of lading. We believe that this comment hasmerit; however, we do not agree that the prohibition against hat shapedor open channel rings should be limited to cargo tanks carrying corrosivematerial. We are aware of several accidents in which a cargo tank faileddue to corrosion of the tank shell underneath a reinforcement ring, wheresuch corrosion was caused externally by environmental elements rather thanby the hazardous materials lading. Therefore, this final rule prohibits,on any cargo tank constructed of carbon steel, hat shaped or open channelrings which preclude visual inspection of the tank shell. <T3>Section 178.345-8 (proposed andSection; 178.340-8) Accident Damage Protection.</T3>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in its comments tothe docket, supported the requirement in proposed 178.340-8(a) for accidentdamage protection for projections from the cargo tank shell. However, theNTSB stated that all projections from the cargo tank should be subjectto the accident damage protection requirements, not just those extendingmore than 2 inches from the tank shell. NTSB stated, in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">While we believe it is the intent of the NPRM to protect all projectionsfrom rollover damage, even if they protrude less than two inches, the languageused in andSection; 178.340-8 (a) and (c) is not entirely clear in that respect.The Safety Board believes that the proposed rule should indicate unequivocallythat all protrusions should have rollover protection.</ITAG>The NTSB cited an accident which occurred near Springville, Alabama, andinvolved the spillage of 3,000 gallons of a Poison B liquid from an overturnedcargo tank. The spill occurred because two 3-inch diameter washout pipes,projecting about 3 inches above the ring stiffeners, were torn away fromthe tank shell. These pipes were not protected by accident damage protectiondevices.In contrast, TTMA commented that 2 inches from the tank was not adequatefor most washouts and sumps. They stated that currently most sumps extend4 inches from the tank and experience has shown little accident damageon such devices. TTMA requested that an exception from the accident damageprotection requirements be granted for those projections which extend lessthan \1/2\ their diameter and less than 4 inches from the tank shell. It was our intention in the NPRM to provide an exception from the accidentdamage protection requirements for domes, sumps, and washout cover plateswhich have a relatively large diameter compared to their height and, therefore,are not likely to be torn from the cargo tank shell in a rollover accidenton the roadway. Accordingly, we proposed an exception from the accidentdamage protection requirements for projections from the cargo tank whichare of a material of a toughness equivalent to that of the tank shell andwhich extend not more than 2 inches from the tank shell. It was not ourintent to except smaller diameter pipes, or projections whose diameteris smaller than the projection from the tank shell, from the accident damageprotection requirements. Upon consideration of both comments, we have clarified this section inthe final rule. Proposed andSection; 178.340-8(a)(1) (andSection; 178.345-8(a)(1)herein) has been revised to clarify that it applies specifically to domes,sumps, and washout cover plates, and that in order for these componentsto be excepted from the accident damage protection requirements, they mustbe of a strength, toughness, and thickness equal to the cargo tank shellthickness. In consideration of NTSB's comment, we believe that damage toprojections from the tank is most likely to occur on the upper two thirdsof the tank. Experience has shown that damage to large-diameter low-profileprojections is very rare. We have clarified our proposal by adding a requirementthat for the top \2/3\ of the tank a projection may extend no more than2 inches or \1/4\ its diameter from the tank without protection. Thus,a 2 inch high projection must be no less than 8 inches in diameter. Forthe bottom \1/3\ of the tank, experience has shown TTMA's proposal to beadequate. Therefore, we have adopted TTMA's recommendation in the finalrule for the lower \1/3\ of the tank. However, proposed andSection; 178.340-8(a)(2)(adopted as andSection; 178.345-(a)(2) herein) is revised to clarify thatall piping, and other devices not identified in andSection; 178.345-8(a)(1),that may retain lading in any tank orientation must be protected from accidentdamage. Commenters objected to the use of the term ``fail safe'' to describe adevice designed to fail sacrificially in order to prevent loss of ladingor failure of the cargo tank shell. According to one commenter, the implicationof the use of the term ``creates a situation wherein failure of the deviceto perform as expected, no matter what the situation, constitutes a designfailure and exposes the designer, constructor, and tank owner to legalaction.'' Commenters recommended that the term ``shear section'' be used,since that is the type of ``fail safe'' device which is used. TTMA proposedthat the wall thickness of the shear section be at least 30 percent lessthan that of the adjacent piping or valve wall as opposed to the current20 percent. We recognize the difficulty which may arise through the useof the term ``fail safe.'' We proposed usage of the term ``fail safe device''in the NPRM in order to provide some flexibility for cargo tank manufacturersand owners in meeting the safety requirements. We believe that the regulationsshould allow the development and use of other devices designed to failsacrificially in order to protect the integrity of the cargo tank. Therefore,andSection; 178.345-8(a)(4), as adopted herein, requires ``a sacrificialdevice such as a shear section.'' We have adopted TTMA's proposal on thereduction of wall thickness in our definition of ``Sacrificial device.''The term ``sacrificial device'' is defined in andSection; 178.345-1 as ``adevice designed to break at no more than 70 percent of the load that wouldbe required to cause failure of the protected lading retention device,part, or tank wall.'' The term ``shear section'' is also defined, as ``asacrificial device fabricated so that the wall thickness of the adjacentpiping is abruptly reduced by at least 30 percent.'' The failure of thesacrificial device must leave the protected lading retention device orpart and its attachment to the tank wall intact and capable of retaininglading. Recently RSPA received a letter requesting clarification on whether a groovewhich is cast, rather than machined, is permissible under the requirementin existing andSection; 178.340-8(d)(1)(i). The existing regulation requiresthat a shear section ``be machined in such a manner as to abruptly reducethe wall thickness of the adjacent piping (or valve) material by at least20 percent.'' RSPA stated in its reply that although an ``as-cast sheargroove'' may produce the same level of safety as the ``machined'' shearsection, andSection; 178-340-8(d)(1)(i) does not provide for such an alternative.This final rule prescribes a performance requirement for a ``sacrificialdevice'' rather than requiring a specific type of device, such as a shearsection. Therefore, an ``as-cast'' shear groove would satisfy the sacrificialdevice requirements if it can be proven through test or other supportinginformation that it meets the performance requirement. That is, the sheargroove must break at no more than 70 percent of the load that would berequired to cause the failure of the protected lading retention device,part, or the tank wall. Commenters objected to the bottom damage protection requirements containedin proposed andSection; 178.340-8(b), particularly the design specificationswhich require any bottom damage protection device to be able to withstand``an impact equivalent to an energy of 275,000 foot pounds.'' This energywas based on the impact of a 4,000 pound automobile at a speed of 50 milesper hour or the impact of an 80,000 pound truck backing into a stationarystructure at 10 miles per hour. Commenters stated that it is not definitivein engineering technology to define something as an impact equivalent toan energy. As one commenter, Fruehauf, stated, ``the strength of the guardneeds to be defined as a force rather than an energy.'' Fruehauf furtherpointed out that this energy could be created by a light object travellingat a high velocity or a heavy object travelling at a low velocity. TTMAand several individual manufacturers recommended that the design forcebe a 45,000 pounds force, with the guard extending at least 6 inches fromany component that may contain lading. TTMA stated that this recommendedforce is based on the results of a rear underride study sponsored by theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In that study,it was determined that 45,000 pounds is the force created by an automobiletravelling at 35 miles per hour impacting a heavy tractor-trailer combination.Our analysis of past studies sponsored by NHTSA and FHWA has shown thata 4000 pound automobile travelling at 50 miles per hour experiences a forcewell in excess of 45,000 pounds upon impacting an 80,000 pound tractor-trailercombination. As stated in the NPRM, according to the accident data fromstudies of underride accidents, a significant percentage of underride accidentsoccur at or near highway speed limits. The 45,000 pound force obtainedby NHTSA in its study of rear-underride accidents was recommended as theimpact force above which the occupants of an automobile, travelling at35 miles per hour, would not survive the impact of striking a tractor-trailercombination. A 1980 study sponsored by the FHWA entitled, ``PerformanceUpgrading of Commercial Vehicle Rear Underride Guards,'' contains an equationfor determining the maximum impact force experienced in a collision betweenan automobile and a truck. Assuming an automobile weight of 4000 poundsand width of 5 feet, a ground clearance of 24 inches, and an impact speedof 50 miles per hour, a maximum impact force of approximately 153,000 poundsis attained. That study recommends that a maximum impact force of 124,000pounds be used in the design of underride guards. The purpose of the FHWAand NHTSA studies differ from our intent in this final rule, in that FHWAand NHTSA were designing a guard to minimize injury to passengers, includinginjury due to the force of impact, in occurrences where the automobileunderrides a tractor-trailer combination. Our intention is to design aguard that will prevent loss of hazardous material lading from the cargotank when lading retention components are struck in a collision. Tha maximumforces experienced in an automobile-tractor-trailer collision are the sameregardless of the purpose of the guard. Therefore, we believe the guardmust be designed to withstand a force of at least 155,000 pounds (basedon the ultimate strength of the material) from the front, side, or rear,uniformly distributed over the surface of the device.The NPRM proposed that the impact energy be applied over an area not greaterthan 6 square feet. Commenters objected to this design feature, declaringthat it is too open for interpretation. This final rule establishes a designforce of 155,000 pounds which must be applied over the surface of the device,but the allowable guard area and width over which the design force maybe applied are limited. It must be pointed out that the bottom damage protection device describedabove is only required if the optional external self-closing stop valveis used. An internal self-closing stop valve equipped with the proper sacrificialdevice need not be protected by an accident damage protection device. Further,in many cases, the vehicle frame, rear wheels, suspension system and rearend tank protection provide all or a significant portion of the necessaryprotection for external valves. Comments addressing the proposed rear-end protection requirements werehandled under a separate rulemaking action addressing rear bumpers on cargotank trucks (Docket HM-183B, 54 FR 18820; May 2, 1989). <T3>Section 178.345-9 (proposed 178.340-9) Pumps, piping, hoses, and connections.</T3>A commenter stated that the provisions in proposed andSection; 178.340-9(a)apply only to loading pumps, as the cargo tank is not on the suction sideof an unloading pump and need not be protected from the pump's outlet pressure.TTMA also stated that this paragraph should apply only to those pumps thatmay pressurize the cargo tank. The intent of this paragraph is to ensurethat the cargo tank is protected from excessive rise in pressure due tothe action of a pump. We do not believe this provision should be restrictedto any one type of pump; however, we do believe that the paragraph canbe restricted to those pumps which may pressurize the cargo tank. Therefore,the words ``that may pressurize the cargo tank'' are added to clarify thatthese pumps must be provided with an automatic means of closure. <T3>Section 178.345-10 (proposed andSection; 178.340-10) Pressure relief.</T3>Several commenters objected to the use of the term ``spring-loaded.'' preferringthe term ``reclosing'' to describe the required valves. We are acceptingthe term ``reclosing''; however, we are prohibiting the use of gravityactuated reclosing valves since they may not reclose in the event of arollover. Most comments received on the requirements for pressure relief systemsaddressed the proposal requiring that a dual function vent be capable ofwithstanding a dynamic pressure surge of 50 psig applied for at least 300milliseconds without leakage of liquid lading regardless of vehicle orientation,and be capable of functioning in the event of sustained pressure rise inexcess of the prescribed set pressure. Most commenters, including TTMAand NTTC, stated that the proposed device does not exist, and that developmentand testing of such a vent would require time and extensive funding. Additionally,as NTTC stated, the device necessary to test this vent would require ahigh degree of sophistication, and funding. Since publication of the NPRM,we have been made aware that at least one manufacturer has developed avent that purports to satisfy the ``dual function'' requirements. Thismanufacturer has publicly stated that the cost of such a vent would beabout twice that of the currently used spring-loaded pressure relief device.We believe that the development, testing, and use of the proposed dualfunction vent is desirable, and that such a device can be effectively andeconomically produced. However, we realize that a reasonable period mustbe provided for development, testing, and ultimately, installation of thesedevices on cargo tank motor vehicles. Therefore, the mandatory use of thedual function pressure relief device is delayed until June 13, 1994. Useof the ``dual function'' device is permissible until that time. We believe that until use of the dual function vent is mandatory, provisionsare needed to limit the amount of product that is released from a pressurerelief device in the event of a dynamic pressure surge, such as duringa rollover, and to ensure that the device reseats and does not leak withina reasonable period. As a result of the various public meetings held betweenDOT and TTMA, TTMA has adapted an Australian standard for testing the behaviorof pressure relief devices in rollover situations. This standard requiresthat each spring-loaded pressure relief valve be subjected to a seriesof three drop tests, to simulate a rollover situation. The amount of liquidejected during the test is measured each time, and the amount lost mustbe less than a specified amount, for all three tests, for the pressurerelief device to meet the requirements of the standard. After June 12,1991, each pressure relief valve must be capable of reseating after a pressuresurge and not release a volume greater than one gallon. This allowablerelease volume was derived from a series of tests conducted by TTMA onexisting pressure relief valves mounted in MC 306 dome covers. During thesetests, the pressure relief valves remained open for an average of 53 millisecondsbefore reseating, with an average of 0.8 gallon of water ejected. Specificinitial pressure conditions and calibration requirements are added to insurethe magnitude and duration of the pressure generated in actual roll-oversis duplicated by the drop test. Several commenters claimed that to install a valve on a tank which wouldwithstand a 50 psig pressure surge for up to 300 milliseconds would createa greater hazard to safety than a valve which releases a small amount ofproduct in a pressure surge. These commenters stated that the cargo tankcould potentially rupture if the pressure of the surge is held inside thetank. Commenters presented no data to support their claim that the cargotank will rupture if subjected to a 50 psig pressure surge. In the absenceof data to support that claim, the requirements for a dual function ventare adopted in the final rule. The requirement contained in proposed andSection; 178.340-11(f) that allpressure relief devices be certified in compliance with the design andtesting requirements by a responsible official of the manufacturer andAuthorized Inspector has been removed. These pressure relief devices mustbe certified by the device manufacturer (See preceding discussion in thispreamble regarding the use of the Authorized Inspector). Certificationin accordance with the ASME Code is required for relief devices built inaccordance with the ASME Code. Several commenters objected to the proposal to prohibit the use of non-reclosingpressure relief devices, specifically for MC 312 cargo tanks (DOT 412 cargotanks herein). Commenters stated that non-reclosing devices, such as fusibleand frangible (rupture) disks, provide a greater venting capacity and areless vulnerable to damage in a rollover accident than reclosing reliefdevices. Further, commenters argued that the MC 312 cargo tank is usedprimarily for corrosive materials. For corrosive materials, a large proportionof the required total venting capacity is for a fire situation and, incertain cases a single, lower capacity reclosing pressure relief deviceis more than adequate to relieve any pressure that will accumulate in thetank due to product expansion. Commenters also stated that to add severalsmaller capacity reclosing devices to replace a larger capacity non-reclosingdevice will unnecessarily add potential sources of leakage to the cargotank.As stated in the preamble to the NPRM, in a cargo tank accident, particularlyan overturn followed by a fire, the functioning of a frangible disc ora fusible element would result in the release of a substantial quantityof lading, while a reclosing valve would minimize the quantity of ladingreleased. Further. we believe that frangible discs are much more likelyto fail as a result of impact and liquid surge than reclosing pressurerelief devices. However, we recognize that low vapor pressure corrosivematerials with no other hazards are not as susceptible to fire as flammablematerials. and do not require the same total venting capacity. Therefore,instead of allowing  frangible discs as a method of reducing the numberof vents required, this final rule provides for a lower total venting capacityfor cargo tanks transporting low vapor pressure corrosive materials withno other hazards. For these cargo tanks, the total venting capacity mustbe determined by the equation appearing in the IM portable tank specificationat andSection; 178.270.11(d)(3). This equation relates the properties ofthe material to the required venting capacity. Cargo tanks with a totalventing capacity determined in this manner must be in dedicated servicefor the corrosive material for which the required venting was calculated.Several commenters argued that the proposed provisions on pressure reliefdevices were different from the pressure relief requirements of the ASMECode. It has always been our position that since cargo tanks are not stationaryvessels, different pressure relief requirements are warranted. Commenters also objected to the proposed elimination of the 1 psig ``normalvent'' from the DOT 406 cargo tank. Those comments are addressed in thediscussion in andSection; 178.346-1, on the design/operating pressure ofthe DOT 406, and in andSection; 178.346-10 on pressure relief devices. <T3>Section 178.345-11 (proposed andSection; 178.340-11) Tank Outlets.</T3>Several commenters stated that a definition of the term ``leak tight''should be established, since a drip-tight seal is extremely difficult tomaintain, particularly for chemical tanks. Commenters requested that alimited amount of leakage be permitted for closures equipped with an additionalleak tight cap or a closure outboard of the primary means of closure. TTMAand several manufacturers requested that leak tight be defined as no liquidleakage in excess of 30 cubic centimeters in 5 minutes with the tank pressurizedto the maximum allowable working pressure. This amounts to in excess ofone-third of a quart per hour. It is our position that any leakage froma closure presents an unsafe condition. even where such closure is providedwith a secondary closure. A leak from the inboard closure would permitthe accumulation of hazardous material lading between the inboard and theoutboard closures, which would be spilled from the piping upon removalof the external closure. Such an occurrence could potentially injure transportworkers or create a fire situation. Therefore, the term ``leak tight''in this final rule means no leakage. During the last several years, RSPA has received numerous inquiries concerningthe required location of the self-closing stop valve required by the cargotank specifications. The NPRM contained a proposal to allow the use of``external'' valves in place of internal valves, provided the externalvalve is adequately protected against damage which could result in lossof lading from the cargo tank shell This provision is revised in the finalrule to identify those situations (valve locations) where accident damageprotection devices are required, and those situations where the use ofa shear section would provide adequate protection against the loss of ladingfrom the cargo tank. The NTSB expressed its opposition to the proposed revision to permit theuse of external valves in lieu of internal valves. NTSB stated: ``The protectionafforded by current requirements will be negated because an external valvewill be more subject to damage from impacts that can render this essentialsafety device useless during emergencies.'' As was stated in the preambleto the NPRM, we believe that vacuum-loaded cargo tanks operating underDOT exemption, which have external self-closing stop valves protected bybottom damage protection, have demonstrated a high level of integrity.We have no experience data to indicate that this type of valve arrangementwith adequate protection presents  an unsafe condition. Therefore. we arepermitting the use of adequately protected external valves. However, wehave specified that the valve must be securely closed during transportation,and remain intact and capable of retaining product if the self-stored energysource is sheared off in an accident. Further, any piping extending beyondthe accident damage protection device must be equipped with a sacrificialdevice which will fail under load in order to protect the external valve,piping and cargo tank wall. Several commenters from the hazardous waste industry objected to the clarificationthat stop valves must be self-closing. Commenters stated that for cargotanks transporting hazardous waste which may contain solids, semi-solids,or foreign objects which may interfere with the operation of the valve,a manually operated valve is preferable. A manually operated valve allowsthe operator to reopen the valve and remove the foreign object. A self-closingvalve, commenters contended, would be damaged in a case where an obstructionblocks reseating of the valve. We recognize that solids or foreign objectsmay be present in waste materials and can potentially create an obstructionto effective seating of the discharge valve. However, many hazardous wasteswhich are transported in vacuum loaded cargo tanks do not contain solidsor foreign objects. Also, the rule does not limit the use of these cargotanks to hazardous wastes. We believe a safety feature must be availablewhich will ensure that the discharge valve closes in an emergency situationsuch as a fire, where the operator may not be able to reach the valve.Therefore, we have revised the proposal to allow the stop valve on a loading/unloadingoutlet to be manually operated in normal loading and unloading operations.In addition, the cargo tank outlet must be equipped with a self-closingfeature that will close automatically in an emergency situation, such asa fire.  The requirements for remote operators and thermally activated closureshave also been revised for clarity. Additionally, a time limit of 30 secondsmaximum has been placed on the time permitted from the actuation of a self-closingvalve system to full closure. This time limit was established based upondiscussions which took place at the public working meetings. <T3>Section 178.345-12 (proposed andSection; 178.340-12) Gauging devices.</T3>The proposal would have required that each cargo tank, except a tank intendedto be filled by weight, be equipped with a gauging device which indicatesthe maximum permitted liquid level. Fruehauf commented that, in additionto allowing tanks to be filled by weight, the filling of tanks by a metershould be included. It was not our intention in the NPRM to limit the authorizedmethod of loading of these cargo tanks. Rather, it was our intention toallow any method that would measure the actual amount of product containedin the cargo tank at any one time, including any heel that remains in thetank when it is reloaded. TTMA stated that cargo tanks filled by volume, or intended to be loadedthrough an open manhole, should also be exempted from the requirement forgauging devices. These methods of loading can perhaps accurately measurethe quantity of hazardous material that is loaded in the tank at the timeof filling, but will not measure any residual lading which remained inthe tank from a previous load. A cargo tank which is loaded by weight willtake into account the total lading in the cargo tank at one time. Therefore,the proposed gauging device requirement is adopted unchanged. <T3>Section 178.345-13 (proposed andSection; 178.340-13) Pressure tests.</T3>This section has been revised to clarify that the pressure test appliesto the ``tank'' rather than the ``cargo tank.'' <T3>Section 178.345-14 (proposed andSection; 178.340-14) Marking. </T3>Severalcommenters stated that the location of the required nameplate and specificationplates should be the right or curb side of the vehicle, in order to ensurethat the inspector is not placed in an unsafe position while inspectingthese plates. Other commenters stated that the location of the plates shouldbe ``on the same side as the NHTSA plate,'' in consideration of any changesmade in the location of the NHTSA plate. The location of the certificationplate was moved to the left side of the cargo tank several years ago tocoincide with the location of the NHTSA identification plate. A changein the location of the plate was not proposed in this rulemaking. Therefore,any discussion of such a change is deferred to a future rulemaking. Commenters also stated that, in addition to allowing the nameplate andspecification plate to be attached directly to the tank, the integral supportingstructure of the tank should be authorized as an attachment site for theplates. RSPA has reservations about allowing the plates to be attachedto the chassis of the cargo tank motor vehicle, because in some instances,a tank will be placed on a new chassis, while the specification plate remainson the old chassis. In this scenario, the cargo tank is rendered out ofspecification due to the lack of a specification plate. However, we donot object to the attachment of the plates to an integral supporting structure,which will never be separated from the tank. The provisions in this section are reorganized to consolidate and placein paragraph (a) the requirements on the location and attachment of thenameplate and specification plate, the information required to be markedon these plates, and the size of the lettering. The proposal would have required that the nameplate be affixed to eachcargo tank, and a specification plate be affixed to each cargo tank motorvehicle. It was our intention to allow the use of a single plate on a cargotank motor vehicle composed of more than one cargo tank made to the samespecification. These provisions are revised to clarify that only one plateis required for each cargo tank motor vehicle if: the cargo tank motorvehicle is composed of non-ASME cargo tanks, none of which are separatedby a void space; all the information required by paragraphs (b) and (c)appears on the plate; and the plate is not covered or hidden by any insulation.If a single plate is used, the information required must be printed foreach cargo tank, from front to rear, in the order of the correspondingcargo tanks. NTTC stated that the color coding requirement in proposed paragraph (f)(2)for specification plates on multi-specification cargo tanks is redundantto the information appearing on the data plate and, therefore, is unnecessary.We agree with the NTTC, and proposed paragraph (f)(2) has been removed.<T3>Section 178.345-15 (proposed andSection; 178.340-15) Certification. </T3>Theproposed provision to require that the certification certificate be signedby an Authorized Inspector, and that a cargo tank not requiring ASME Codecertification be certified as ``constructed in accordance with the ASMECode'' are not adopted in this final rule. See the earlier preamble discussionsunder subject headings. In addition, the proposed requirement that design drawings be attachedto the certification certificate and be provided to the purchaser has beenremoved. We believe that it is important for drawings to be furnished tothe final manufacturer in a multi-stage construction. However, based onthe comments we received, we no longer believe it is necessary for DOTto require that the drawings be provided to the purchaser of the cargotank motor vehicle. <T3>Section 178.346 (Specification DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicle). </T3>Numerouscommenters addressed the proposed revision of the MC 306 cargo tank specification.Commenters objected to the designation of the MAWP (design pressure) rangeof an MC 306 cargo tank between 3 psig and 14.9 psig. Comments receivedfrom cargo tank manufacturers, motor carriers and shippers all stated thatthere is no need to set the minimum pressure of this cargo tank at 3 psig,as these cargo tanks have been operating successfully for many years ata working pressure of 1 psig, which is maintained through the use of the1 psig normal vent. The normal vent was not included in the NPRM. A minimumMAWP of 3 psig would have required that pressure relief devices be setat 3 psig, identical to current MC 306 cargo tank specification requirements.Operators of MC 306 cargo tanks used to transport gasoline have statedthat the normal vent, in normal operation, vents predominantly air. Duringtransportation, the gasoline heats up and expands, increasing the pressurein the vapor space of the tank, which contains mostly air. This increasedpressure is relieved when it reaches 1 psig. Without the normal vent, commentersstated, the cargo tank will be operated at higher pressures unnecessarilyand perhaps unsafely, with a reduction in the fatigue life of the cargotank. As was stated earlier in this document, we are concerned that in an overturnsituation, even with an undamaged cargo tank, relief valves set at a pressureless than that determined from the formula in andSection; 173.33(c) willrelease product continuously without reseating. However, the design ofthe 1 psig normal vent is such that it will not function in an overturnsituation. We also point out that the MC 306 cargo tank is not used exclusivelyfor gasoline, and higher vapor pressure materials could be transportedin these cargo tanks, provided the MAWP of the tank complied with proposedandSection; 173.33(c). A cargo tank equipped with a normal vent, carryinglading with a vapor pressure greater than 1 psig, would vent lading throughthe normal vent during normal transportation conditions. For this reason,in the final rule a 1 psig normal vent may be installed only on a DOT 406(or MC 306-type) cargo tank which is used to transport a material for whichthe sum of the vapor pressure at 115 anddegrees;F and 1 psig is less thanor equal to the MAWP. Manufacturers and carriers have maintained that there is no need to definea range of MAWP's for this cargo tank, since there are no cargo tanks currentlybuilt to the MC 306 specification which have a design pressure of ``over3 psig and less than 14.9 psig.'' They stated that the MC 306 is generallyconsidered to be a ``gasoline'' cargo tank. Taking full consideration ofthese comments, we have established a minimum MAWP for a DOT 406 cargotank based on the minimum pressure that any point on the cargo tank mightsee when in a rollover situation. The final rule establishes a minimumMAWP of 2.65 psig for the DOT 406 cargo tank. This pressure includes thestatic head of a gasoline lading in a typical MC 306-type cargo tank, plusa maximum of 1 psig of vapor pressure which will be seen in a tank equippedwith a normal vent. For DOT 406 cargo tanks with a larger static head thanthat produced by gasoline in cargo tanks currently used, the MAWP mustexceed 2.65 psig. In each case the required MAWP for the lading must bedetermined in accordance with andSection; 173.33(c). The MAWP of a cargotank not equipped with a normal vent may be as high as 4 psig to accountfor the variations in the lading. (See also discussion of maximum ambienttemperature table for gasoline in andSection; 173.119). To accommodate situations where the ASME Code conflicts with current MC306 design and construction practices, TTMA presented a list of sectionsof the ASME Code which they believe should not apply to construction ofthe new DOT 406 cargo tanks, including those sections relating to headformation and installation. We do not believe that adequate justificationwas presented for the elimination of many of the sections of the ASME Codecited by TTMA for exception in the DOT 406 specification. However, we agreethat certain provisions in the ASME Code need not be applied to the constructionof the DOT 406 cargo tank. As discussed earlier in the preamble, andSection; 178.345-1 provides certainexceptions to the ASME Code for the DOT 406 cargo tank. These exceptionsinclude the required certification by a National Board authorized inspector,the use of ``stuffed heads,'' and the construction of cargo tanks withan elliptical cross section. Other exceptions include the required loadingsto be used in stress calculations, marking and certification of the cargotank, material identification and recordkeeping requirements. Thickness tables for shell, heads, bulkheads, and baffles for DOT 406 cargotanks are contained in andSection; 178.346-2. These tables have been greatlysimplified, and are based on the volume of the cargo tank in gallons ratherthan on the volume capacity in gallons per inch, as has been used previously,because of the elliptical shape of most of these cargo tanks. Section 178.346-10 contains a provision to allow the 1 psig ``normal vent,''as discussed earlier in this preamble. We are allowing the use of a 1 psigvent in order to extend the life of the cargo tank, on the basis that thisvent releases predominantly air, and not hazardous material lading, duringtransportation. This section limits the use of cargo tanks equipped withnormal vents to ladings meeting the requirements of andSection; 173.33(c)(1)(i)(C).As was discussed earlier in this document, the final rule requires pressurerelief devices to be set at 120 percent of the MAWP of the cargo tank.Many commenters to proposed andSection; 178.340-10 objected to the requirementthat reclosing pressure relief devices close after discharge at not lessthan 90% of the set-to-discharge pressure, as it applies to the MC 306cargo tank. For these cargo tanks, in order for a valve seat to lift highenough to allow the large airflows required in this specification, reclosingat 90% of the opening pressure will be nearly impossible. A commenter recommendedthat the reclosing pressure be reduced to 75% of the opening pressure.We believe that this comment has merit; however, in a cargo tank accidentinvolving a rollover, the pressure exerted on the pressure relief devicewill be equal to the tank static head of lading plus the vapor pressureof the lading added to any gas padding. For cargo tanks equipped with a1 psig normal vent transporting gasoline, the minimum pressure in thissituation is 2.65 psig. Therefore the minimum reclosing pressure for arelief device on these tanks must be 2.65 psig, to ensure that the deviceindeed reseats, particularly during an overturn situation. To allow thispressure to be 75% of the set-to-discharge pressure would necessitate aminimum set pressure of 3.5 psig. However, this pressure is 130 percentof the MAWP of the cargo tank. In order to balance the requirements fora minimum reclosing pressure, and the concerns of the industry regardingthe necessary differential between the set pressure and the reclosing pressure,the final rule requires that the primary pressure relief valves on DOT406 cargo tanks be set to discharge at 125 percent of the MAWP (or 3.3psig for gasoline cargo tanks equipped with a normal vent), and recloseat not less than 80 percent of the set to discharge pressure. The highersetting of relief valves at 125 percent of the tank MAWP has precedencein the intermodal tank area, where an ASME Code case approved such an arrangement.The required minimum reclosing pressure of 80 percent of the set pressurewill provide substantial relief from the general requirement which statesthat pressure relief devices must reseat at not less than 90 percent ofthe set to discharge pressure. TTMA suggested certain additional testing requirements for MC 306 cargotanks. These tests would be used to ensure the proper functioning of reliefvalves at the set-to-discharge pressure, and ensure that these devicesretain the cargo tank pressure below the set-to-discharge pressure. Thesedevices are required to be tested and certified by the device manufacturerat the time of manufacture, and will be periodically tested in accordancewith the requirements of Part 180. We believe it is unnecessary to addthese additional requirements to the cargo tank manufacturing specifications.The required test pressure found in andSection; 178.346-13 herein has beenchanged to the greater of 5 psig or 150 percent of the MAWP, and the inspectionpressure to the MAWP, with a minimum of 2.65 psig, to coincide with thechange to prescribe the minimum MAWP of 2.65 psig for a DOT 406 cargo tank.<T3>Section 178.347 (Specification DOT 407 cargo tank motor vehicle).</T3>As discussed earlier in the preamble, certain requirements have been relaxed.DOT 407 cargo tanks with a design pressure of 35 psig or less must be constructedin accordance with the ASME Code, with certain exceptions which are foundin andSection; 178.347-1. These exceptions include the use of a RegisteredInspector in place of an Authorized Inspector for inspection and certification;the use of the ``stuffed head'' configuration, and knuckle radius of lessthan 6% of the tank diameter. Other exceptions include the required loadingsto be used in stress calculations, marking and certification of the cargotank, material identification and recordkeeping requirements. Cargo tanks with a design pressure above 35 psig must be constructed andcertified in full conformance with the ASME Code. These cargo tanks areof sufficiently high pressure to warrant the additional safety benefitsof the ASME Code. Cargo tanks constructed to these pressures are generallynot constructed with ``stuffed heads.'' Revised thickness tables, as discussed in the preamble to andSection; 178.345-2,are found in andSection; 178.347-2. Where the minimum thicknesses recommendedby TTMA are lower than the thicknesses required by the current regulations,the higher values found in the current regulations are prescribed in thetable. Several commenters pointed out that vacuum relief devices should not berequired on vacuum-loaded cargo tanks. We agree with the commenters andan exception has been added in andSection; 178.347-10(b) which grants relieffrom the requirement for vacuum relief devices on cargo tanks designedto be loaded by vacuum. Cargo tanks not designed to be loaded by vacuum,however, must have a vacuum relief system capable of limiting the vacuumin the tank to less than 80 percent of the design vacuum capability ofthe cargo tank. <T3>Section 178.348 (Specification DOT 412 cargo tank motor vehicle).</T3>A commenter stated that lower pressure (less than 15 psig design pressure)MC 312 cargo tanks, with elliptical cross-sections, are being used to transportlow-density, low vapor pressure corrosive materials in oilfield servicingoperations. The hazardous materials carried in these cargo tanks wouldrequire a design pressure less than 15 psig, based on the requirementsof andSection; 173.33(c). The commenter argued that there is no need to requirea minimum design pressure of 15 psig, and full ASME construction, for thesecargo tanks. Application of the ASME Code would require a circular cross-sectionto replace the elliptical cross-section currently used, and create cargotanks with a higher center of gravity and less stability. Due to the lesserhazard and low vapor pressure of these materials, we agree that a 15 psigminimum design pressure is not necessary. To permit the transportation of hazardous materials with low vapor pressure,we have revised the minimum MAWP for DOT 412 cargo tanks to 5 psig. Therequirements of andSection; 173.33(c) must be met for any material to betransported in these cargo tanks. Any DOT 412 cargo tank with an MAWP between5 and 15 psig must be constructed in accordance with the ASME Code withcertain exceptions. These exceptions allow an elliptical cross-section,and all inspection and certification of these tanks may be performed bya Registered Inspector instead of an Authorized Inspector. As stated in the discussion of andSection; 178.345-10 earlier in this preamble,several commenters asked that non-reclosing pressure relief valves be authorizedfor MC 312 cargo tanks transporting corrosive materials. Alternatively,andSection; 178.348-10 has been revised to allow a lower total venting capacityon these cargo tanks only when used in dedicated service for corrosivematerials with no other hazard. <T3>Subpart F, Part 180. </T3>This new subpart establishes the requirementsfor the retest, requalification and use of cargo tank motor vehicles. <T3>Section 180.403. </T3>Several comments were received on the proposeddefinitions contained in this section. <T3>Modification. </T3>Several commenters stated that the definition of``modification'' should be revised to include only changes to the originalcargo tank shell design. They stated that this change would ensure thatthe replacement of valves and fittings, and minor changes to appurtenances,such as fender attachments, lighting brackets, and ladder brackets wouldnot be construed as modification. We agree that minor changes to non-ladingretention components of the cargo tank, and replacement of valves and fittings,as long as they are in conformance with the original design criteria andappropriate specification, should not be considered ``modifications.''Therefore, the definition of ``modification'' is revised to clarify thatmodification means any change to a tank's original design and constructionthat would affect the structural integrity of the tank, and to excludeminor changes to and replacement of many appurtenances, fittings, valves,and vents. We have also removed ``stretching,'' which is also defined inthis section, from the definition of ``modification.''<T3>Rebarrelling.</T3> Several commenters objected to the proposed definitionof ``rebarrelling'' which was defined as ``replacing more than 25 percentof the shell material of a cargo tank.'' Commenters stated that ``rebarrelling''should mean replacement of 100 percent of the cargo tank shell, and thatsuch replacement of the cargo tank shell material should not be subjectto the requirements in andSection; 180.413, which would require any rebarrellingto conform to the specification in effect at the time of rebarrelling.We disagree with the commenters. It is our position that replacement ofa large portion of the cargo tank wall constitutes the manufacture of anew cargo tank, and the cargo tank must conform to the specification requirementsin effect at the time of manufacture. What constitutes rebarrelling wasdiscussed at the public meetings. In consideration of those discussions,``rebarrelling'' is defined in this final rule to mean replacing more than50 percent of the cargo tank wall. <T3>Repair.</T3> The definition of ``repair'' is revised to clarify thatthe term refers only to work involving welding on a cargo tank's pressureparts. Therefore, the replacement of a valve or fitting which involvesno welding does not constitute a ``repair'' and, therefore, is not requiredto be performed in an ASME ``U'' shop or a National Board ``R'' shop. Paragraph (c) of this section permits the modification of the pressurerelief devices and outlets of certain cargo tank specifications previouslyauthorized to conform to a new specification. For instance, the outletson an MC 307 cargo tank may be modified to conform to the outlet requirementsfound in the DOT 407 specification. This provision will allow MC 307 cargotanks to be equipped with external self-closing stop valves, provided thevalves are adequately protected as required by andSection; 178.345-8. <T3>Section 180.405.</T3> Paragraph (f) of this section contains provisionsfor re-marking certain cargo tanks manufactured under the terms of an exemptionas DOT specification cargo tanks, under certain circumstances. This provisiongenerally refers to vacuum-loaded cargo tanks constructed under exemption,substantially in compliance with the MC 307 or MC 312 cargo tank. For manyyears we have required that vacuum-loaded cargo tanks must be equippedwith self-closing valves. There has been a great deal of confusion andmisunderstanding on the part of exemption holders regarding the self-closingand remote closure features of these valves. This has resulted in cargotanks manufactured without these features. It still is our position thatthese valves must have a self-closing feature; however, this self-closingfeature may be external to the valve. This will allow the use of a valvewhich may be manually operated in normal loading and unloading operations.In order to allow adequate time for owners of vacuum loaded hazardous wastecargo tanks currently under exemption to equip their cargo tanks with self-closingvalves, we are providing a 2-year compliance period. Cargo tanks meetingthe requirements of andSection; 180.405(f) except for the self-closing valverequirement, may be re-marked in accordance with that paragraph only afterthe self-closing valve has been installed. The requirement currently in andSection; 173.33(a)(2) granting a 36-monthcompliance period for certain cargo tank motor vehicles to be equippedwith a rear accident damage protection device has been placed in andSection;180.405(1). The MC 303 cargo tank motor vehicle, which is a MC 306 typecargo tank, was not included in the final rule adopting those provisions(Docket HM-183B). It is added in this rule. <T3>Section 180.407.</T3> Existing andSection; 173.33(d)(i) contains an exceptionfrom the hydrostatic or pneumatic test for MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanksused only in sodium metal service, since sodium metal presents a severefire risk in contact with water, and the purity of the sodium metal mustbe maintained. A new Note 1 has been added to the Retest and InspectionTable in andSection; 180.407(c) which retains this exception. A commenter stated that lined or clad cargo tanks should not be hydrostaticallyretested. The commenter stated that a visual internal examination willreveal any problem with the lining that must be corrected. Further, thecommenter pointed out that the tank car retest table in andSection; 173.31excepts glass, rubber, lead, or elastomeric lined tanks from periodic retest,and a similar exception should apply to cargo tanks. We agree with thecommenter that for lower pressure cargo tanks, hydrostatic testing of acargo tank which is lined or clad may not be a suitable indicator of thetank's structural integrity, particularly where the lining or claddingprovides additional support to the tank. If a problem or defect in thelining or cladding exists, hydrostatic testing may cause deteriorationof the tank under the lining, especially with acidic ladings. Therefore,a new Note 2 is added to the Retest and Inspection Table which containsan exception from the pressure test for uninsulated lined or clad tankswith a design pressure or MAWP less than 15 psig. These cargo tanks willbe subject to the periodic lining inspection requirements. We believe thathigher pressure (greater than or equal to 15 psig MAWP or design pressure)cargo tanks must be hydrostatically tested, and this requirement appearsin the final rule. Several commenters also noted that exceptions from the external and internalvisual inspections which appear in the current regulations for certaincargo tanks for which such inspection is impracticable or impossible werenot included in the NPRM. These provisions were inadvertently omitted inthe NPRM. Accordingly, paragraph (d), in the final rule, allows an internalvisual inspection to be performed in place of the external visual inspectionfor cargo tanks which are insulated, and allows the pressure retest conductedin accordance with this section to be used in place of both the internaland external visual inspections when visual inspection of the cargo tankis precluded by both internal coating and external insulation, or whenthe cargo tank is not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening. Paragraph(e) contains an exception from the internal inspection requirements forcargo tanks not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening. Paragraph (g) has been relaxed to allow inspectors other than RegisteredInspectors to perform the pressure test. The inspector's qualificationmust be as prescribed in andSection; 180.409, and the inspector must be identifiedto the Department in accordance with that section. Several commenters objected to the proposed requirement in andSection; 180.407(d)(2)to remove all spring-loaded pressure relief valves from the cargo tankfor inspection and testing. These commenters pointed out that the pressurerelief devices for MC 306-type cargo tanks are usually mounted in the domecover. The removal of the dome cover on an annual basis for inspectionand testing of the pressure relief valves would create unnecessary expenseand downtime. Commenters recommended that the pressure relief devices beremoved for inspection and testing at the time of the pressure test, whichfor most cargo tanks is at a 5 year interval. We believe the commenters'suggestion has merit. However, we do not believe that a 5-year frequencyin removal, testing, and inspection is adequate for pressure relief deviceswhich may be subject to corrosion damage due to the lading. Corrosion damagedue to environmental elements can be detected during the annual externalvisual inspection. Therefore, as adopted in this final rule, pressure reliefvalves must be externally inspected for any corrosion or damage which mightprevent safe operation, during the annual external visual inspection. Onlythose pressure relief valves on cargo tanks used to transport lading corrosiveto the valve must be removed for testing and inspection on an annual basis.All pressure relief devices must be removed from the cargo tank for testingand inspection at the time of the pressure test.A new provision has been added to the external visual inspection requirementsin andSection; 180.407(d)(2) to address the inspection of the gaskets onfull opening rear heads. Additionally, the frequency of visual inspectionof cargo tanks with full opening rear heads has been increased to onceevery 6 months in lieu of once each year. At the suggestion of the NationalPropane Gas Association (NPGA) (formerly National Liquefied Petroleum GasAssociation) and several other commenters, a requirement to inspect thetank head and shell areas covered by the upper skid plate for corrodedand abraded areas has been added to the visual inspection requirements.This inspection must be conducted at the time of the internal visual inspection,since we do not believe it is necessary to inspect this area on an annualbasis. The hydrostatic pressure test described in andSection; 180.407(g) has alsobeen modified to include only the cargo tank, less fittings, as containedin the current regulations. Additionally, in accordance with NTTC's comments,this section has been revised to clarify that owners of fewer than 5 cargotanks have 5 years in which to pressure test their cargo tanks. As statedearlier, the requirement for removal of pressure relief valves for inspectionand testing must be performed at the time of the pressure test for mostcargo tanks. Proposed paragraph (g)(4) would have required that each MC 330 and MC 331cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel, or constructed ofother than quenched and tempered steel but without postweld heat treatment,used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied petroleum gas,or any other hazardous material that may cause stress corrosion cracking,be inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediatelyprior to and in conjunction with the pressure test. Several commenters,including the NPGA and the CGA objected to the application of the requirementsto all cargo tanks used to transport liquefied petroleum gas in this requirement.These commenters stated that only ``corrosive'' liquefied petroleum gastransported in cargo tanks constructed of quenched and tempered steel causesstress corrosion cracking, and liquefied petroleum gas which is transportedin accordance with 49 CFR is not corrosive to the tank. They further indicatedthat the transportation of corrosive LP gas in quenched and tempered steelcargo tanks is a compliance problem rather than a problem with existingregulations. The commenters claim that the addition of the proposed wetfluorescent magnetic particle inspection presents an unacceptable expenseto those motor carriers who are currently complying with the requirementsfor transportation of liquefied petroleum gas. We believe that in many cases, a load of ``sour'' LP gas will be transportedin a cargo tank due to inadequate product testing on the part of shippersand carriers. We agree that this situation constitutes non-compliance withthe current regulations, and there is insufficient data to indicate that``non- corrosive'' LP gas causes stress corrosion cracking, or that ``corrosive''LP gas causes stress corrosion cracking in cargo tanks constructed of otherthan quenched and tempered steel. Therefore, for cargo tanks transportingliquefied petroleum gas, we have limited the requirement for wet fluorescentmagnetic particle inspection to cargo tanks constructed of quenched andtempered steel (Part UHT of the ASME Code). However, this includes thetransportation of all liquefied petroleum gas and not only that which isconsidered ``corrosive.'' Several commenters argued that MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks should beexcepted from the leakage test, since these tanks are effectively leaktested every refill. The requirements for the leakage test, which appearin paragraph (h), have been clarified to allow the leakage test to be evaluatedwith the hazardous materials lading in the tank for MC 330 and MC 331 cargotanks <T3>Section 180.409. </T3>Paragraph (a) of this section has been clarifiedto indicate that all persons performing any prescribed inspection or testmust be familiar with the cargo tank and skillful in the use of the inspectionand testing equipment needed. As stated earlier in this preamble underthe heading ``Inspection and Testing'', the requirement that the personperforming thickness testing be qualified in accordance with ASNT LevelII for ultrasonic testing has been dropped. The person performing thicknesstesting must be trained in the use of the thickness testing device by theemployer of the tester in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturerof the thickness testing device. Additionally, the person performing, orwitnessing and certifying, the pressure test may be a Registered Inspectoror an employee of the motor carrier or the owner of the cargo tank whohas training and experience in conducting pressure tests in accordancewith the ASME Code. <T3>Section 180.411. </T3>Several commenters objected to the acceptabilityof results of tests and inspections related to cuts, digs, or gouges. TheNPRM stated that no cut, dig, or gouge may be greater than 4 inches inlength. Commenters stated that the length of the cut, dig, or gouge isirrelevant; the important factor being the depth of the defect. We agreethat the most important factor of any cut, dig, or gouge is its depth.Accordingly, we have removed the length specification and now require thatthe minimum thickness remaining beneath a cut, dig, or gouge not be lessthan that prescribed in the applicable specification. Several commenters argued that this section is too restrictive in thatit does not allow any reduction in thickness below that prescribed in theapplicable specification. These commenters pointed out that CGA TB-2, whichis referenced in the repair procedures for MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks,allows minor defects to be removed by grinding if the wall thickness isnot reduced below that shown on the data plate minus 0.010 inch. It wasrecommended that some tolerance be allowed for isolated areas. We haveconsistently held that, as stated in the current regulations at andSection;177.824(i) (and in andSection; 180.407(j) herein), the cargo tank metal certificationplate must be removed or made illegible if for any reason a cargo tankno longer meets the applicable specification. This includes the minimumwall thickness. Shippers and carriers were made aware of these provisionsin a rule related notice titled ``Carriers and Shippers_Concerning ContinuingQualification of Cargo Tanks'' (48 FR 15127; April 7, 1983). <T3>Section 180.413. </T3>Commenters objected to the proposed requirementthat any repair, modification, stretching, or rebarrelling be performedin accordance with the specification in effect at the time the work isdone. Commenters stated that we should require only that the work conformto the specification at the time of manufacture. In many cases, the entirecargo tank could not be brought into compliance with the new specifications.We believe that a stretching or rebarrelling constitutes a major changeto the cargo tank which effectively creates a new cargo tank, and thatsuch work must be performed in accordance with the specification requirementsin effect at the time of stretching or rebarrelling The change in the definitionof ``rebarrelling'' from 25 to 50 percent replacement of the cargo tankwall will limit the number of changes to a cargo tank which require conformancewith the current specification rather than the specification in effectat the time of manufacture. Additionally, we have made certain changesto clarify that only the parts affected by the stretching or rebarrellingneed be in compliance with a new specification. ``Modifications'' and ``repairs''may conform to the original specification or to the specification in effectat the time the work is performed. The requirement that repairs be certified by an Authorized Inspector hasbeen relaxed to allow certification by a Registered Inspector. Proposedparagraph (b)(vi) of andSection; 180.413 has been changed to require repairsto MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks to be performed in accordance with theNational Board Inspection Code's ``Provisions for Repair of Pressure Vessels''instead of section VIII of the ASME Code under which the cargo tank wasbuilt. The National Board Inspection Code more specifically addresses repair.<T3>Section 180.415. </T3>The letter ``<T3>K</T3>'' has been added to designate the leakage test in cargo tankmarkings. <T3>Section 180.417. </T3>Paragraph (a)(3)(i) has been revised to allowtesting and certification of non-ASME Code stamped cargo tanks under thedirect supervision of a Registered Inspector rather than an AuthorizedInspector. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Notices </ITAG>A.
