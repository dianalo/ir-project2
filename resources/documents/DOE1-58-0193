Normal (euthyroid), hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rats were used.Gastric lesion incidence and severity was significantly increased inhypothyroid rats, whereas in contrast hyperthyroid rats developed significantlyless gastric lesions. As anticipated, plasma levels of thyroxin (T{sub4}) were significantly elevated in hyperthyroid rats, and undetectablein hypothyroid rats. Acute pretreatment with i.p. cimetidine, but notT{sub 4} 1 h prior to stress completely prevented gastric lesions formationin hypothyroid rats. Finally, binding of {sup 3}H-dihydroalprenolol to{beta}-adrenergic receptors on brain membranes prepared from frontalcortex was reduced by 20% in hypothyroid rats after 3 h of stress. Theseand other data contained herein suggest that thyroid hormones contributeto modulate the responsiveness of the gastric mucosa to stress. The increaserate of ulcerogenesis observed in hypothyroid rats appears to be mediatedby gastric acid secretion. The central mechanism for this response mayinvolve decreased brain nonadrenergic receptor function.</TEXT></DOC>
