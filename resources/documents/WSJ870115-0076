Mario Cuomo's plan to appoint a public power authority to negotiate a state takeover of Lilco.    Lilco filed suit in federal district court in Albany, charging that legislation that would establish the authority is unconstitutional, in part because it would enable the state to &quot;coerce&quot; Lilco shareholders into selling at &quot;far below&quot; the stock's &quot;true value.&quot;    Lilco further charged that Gov. Cuomo and others conspired to &quot;destroy Lilco's very existence&quot; by passing a &quot;Used and Useful&quot; act, that is, a law that retroactively changes rate-making procedures so that if the utility's Shoreham nuclear power plant doesn't go into service, its costs of more than $4 billion can't be recovered from ratepayers. That law was passed in mid-1986.    The Shoreham plant was completed months ago but still hasn't been federally licensed because of state and local opposition over the adequacy of Lilco's emergency evacuation plan for the area surrounding the plant. A drill was held last February. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has scheduled licensing hearings beginning next month but hasn't indicated when it might make a ruling.    Lilco's announcement was made late yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the utility's stock closed at $10.50, up 25 cents.    In a prepared statement, Gov. Cuomo said he is still &quot;totally committed&quot; to implementing the public power authority statute. He said Lilco was &quot;desperately trying to derail&quot; well-conceived legislation, throwing up &quot;barricades&quot; to &quot;safe and reliable energy&quot; for Long Island.    Paul C. Parshley, a utility analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said, &quot;We're in store for a long battle&quot; between New York state and Lilco's management. He added that Lilco has built up a &quot;war chest&quot; that should allow them to fight in court well into 1988.    But Daniel Scotto, utility analyst for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, said Lilco might have been better advised to negotiate with Gov. Cuomo rather than confront him in court. He explained that next month the governor will appoint six new members to the seven-member state utility commission, giving him a &quot;big trump card&quot; with which to influence Lilco's operations.    Anthony Earley, Lilco's general counsel, said the utility didn't seek a temporary restraining order against the creation of the authority. He explained that the authority can't take any steps to take over Lilco until it first finds that a public authority would be able to provide lower electricity rates -- a process that would take a few months.    Under the legislation, the power authority goes into operation today. Among those whose names were announced by Gov. Cuomo's office yesterday was Stephen Liss, counsel to New York Assemblyman Paul Harenberg, who introduced the statute.    Mr. Liss, who wrote the act, said of the Lilco suit: &quot;Lilco has been spitting in the face of Long Islanders for a long time. Now they're saying to hell with the state Legislature.&quot;    Others who were named yesterday were: William Mack, a building contractor and chairman of the Javits Convention Center; Nora Bredes, head of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition, a citizens' group working to keep Shoreham from ever operating; Irving Like, an attorney who has represented Long Island counties against Lilco on rate-increase requests; Richard Kessel, the state Consumer Protection Board director; John Canas, president of North Fork Bancorp in East Moriches, N.Y., and Vincent Tese, the state's economic development director. Mr. Mack will serve as chairman.    In an interview, Ms. Bredes said a public takeover of Lilco would be &quot;healthy.&quot; Mr. Like, in a separate interview, said Lilco management has made several mistakes over the years, including consistently overstating power requirements and making unsound outside investments, such as in a uranium mine that subsequently went bankrupt.    The others couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
