The bone injuries of theskull were occasionally taken less into consideration, because in comparisonto intracranial brain damage they were considered less important andthe possibilities of their description using old first generation CTinstruments was sometimes unsatisfactory because of the large layer thicknesses.As a result of further technological development of CT instruments, theso-called third generation, there has been a marked improvement in thedescription of the skull's bony structures and accordingly an influenceon the therapeutic procedures used with skull-brain injuries. The advantagesof the computed tomography in diagnosis of skull fractures in comparisonto the conventional X-ray diagnosis are: no special position of the patients;small radiation dose; description of fleshy and bony lesions in one examinationstep; consistent picture quality and the diagnosis of almost twice asmany skull fractures as was possible with the first general pictures.The disadvantage is that fractures, which lie parallel to the scanningplane (for example, orbital floor fractures, cannot be detected. Computedtomography with skull and brain injuries should not be used just to describeintracranial lesions, but also in addition to delicately examine theskull base, this above all for the early detection of severe lesionsand to minimize further costly and complicated examinations. The earlydetection of skull fractures helps to avoid later problems and allowsprompt therapeutical measures to be taken.</TEXT></DOC>
