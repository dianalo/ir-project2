<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0147 </DOCNO><TEXT>A laser spectroscopy system has been developed to observe on-line theatomic hyperfine structure of nuclides produced by heavy-ion collisionsand formed into a monoenergetic beam with an isotope separator. The systemhas been used to observe the hyperfine structure and isotope shifts of/sup 189-194,201,203,205/Tl. We present here a brief description of thesystem and discuss its performance characteristics in these initial experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
