The curbs expire Sept. 30 and President Bush is expected to issuea decision that tries to mollify both sides.   In 1984, the Reagan administration negotiated five-year,product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' with 29nations, including Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the EuropeanCommunity, to limit the flow of steel into the United States.

The requests for a stay had been filed in June by the Puerto RicoTelephone Co. and La Telefonica Larga Distancia, which had said thenew plan to limit the prices American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. cancharge would put the two companies at a competitive disadvantage.   But the FCC, in a decision made public Tuesday, concluded thatthe companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a stay and thepublic would benefit from the new pricing.   ATandamp;T last month told the commission it would lower its prices by$140 million on July 1. The price cap lets ATandamp;T, which in 1988controlled 68 percent of the U.S. long-distance market, raise rates3 percent less than the rate of inflation in three categories ofservice: residential and small business; 800 calls; and otherbusiness services, mainly for large customers.</TEXT></DOC>
