Firing back at Democrats who have criticized hisadministration's efforts to prosecute white-collar crime, Mr.Bush told a gathering of hundreds of federal enforcementofficials that the Justice Department will form newcommittees and task forces to coordinate Sandamp;L investigationsand &quot;throw the crooks in jail.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The president praised a variety of recent legislativeproposals to help prosecutors go after financial crime,including one that would allow federal investigators torequest court-ordered wiretaps in bank fraud cases. Hechastized Congress for moving too slowly to appropriateadditional money for criminal investigations of the deeplytroubled Sandamp;L industry. And he proposed that Congressauthorize $100 million for such investigations for fiscalyear 1991, a $25 million increase over the amount currentlyauthorized.   Congressional Democrats rejected the Bush assault,pointing out that for fiscal years 1989 and 1990, Mr. Bushdidn't even propose spending the full $75 million thatCongress had authorized for Sandamp;L enforcement. Speaking onbehalf of the critics, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) saidfederal prosecutors have moved slowly in seeking indictments,creating a huge backlog of unaddressed cases.</TEXT></DOC>
