The commission authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction from a federal court. The commission said it had reason to believe that the merger could substantially reduce competition in syndicated national tracking of which products consumers buy.    New York-based Dun andamp; Bradstreet and Chicago-based Information Resources provide such tracking services, the FTC said, and only one other company, SAMI/Burke Inc., is in the same business.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Nielsen Marketing Research provides tracking information on brand sales, market shares and related marketing data. Its Nielsen Media Research provides measurements of television audiences. Chicago-based Information Resources provides test-marketing services and a variety of database services, the companies said. The merger is aimed at creating a unit of Dun andamp; Bradstreet called Nielsen Information Resources.    Neither company had any immediate comment on the FTC announcement.    A federal challenge had been widely expected. According to some analysts, the combined firms would have controlled roughly 40% of some types of market research on consumer goods.    For example, an Information Resources service, InfoScan, competes directly against Nielsen's ScanTrack service. The services provide historic data on consumer buying patterns and television ads and coupons, among other things.    In October, the companies disclosed additional information about the proposed combination in response to a request from the FTC. The waiting period for regulatory clearance of the pact under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act was slated to expire today.    Under terms of the definitive pact announced in August, Dun andamp; Bradstreet agreed to swap 0.5084 common share for each of Information Resources' 16.8 million common shares.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Dun closed at $51.50, up $1.50. In national over-the-counter trading, Information Resources closed at $21, up $2.125. News of the FTC announcement was made after the close of trading.    The value of the proposed acquisition has plummeted since it was announced before the stock-market crash. In late August, Dun andamp; Bradstreet traded at $67 a share, which gave the transaction an indicated value of $572 million. </TEXT></DOC>
