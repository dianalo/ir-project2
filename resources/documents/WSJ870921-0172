Our research indicates that the real culprit is fresh-air ventilation. Commercial airlines are engaged in a policy to reduce fresh-air ventilation aboard aircraft in an effort to conserve fuel by reducing the number of air packs operating during flight. It is this policy that allows unhealthy conditions to exist in the cabin.    Reduced fresh air increases the level of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide from sources such as tobacco smoke, jet exhaust, fellow passengers, ozone and other contaminants. An American Medical Association report published in February 1982 found that reduced pressurization causes less oxygen to dissolve in the blood as it passes through the lungs. A person's inability to compensate for a decrease in cabin pressure may cause intermittent pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure) and associated ventilatory or cardiac decompensation (the inability of the heart to compensate for its defects).    Ozone exposure has been identified with such symptoms as chest pain or tightness, difficulty in breathing, a persistent cough and a sore dry throat. Prior to March 1978, over 45% of the membership of the Independent Union of Flight Attendants (IUFA) experienced these symptoms. Nonozone related symptoms were also recorded. Over 50% of the flight attendants had chronic difficulty with ears, 85% complained of extreme fatigue, 50% experienced headaches and neck pain, over 25% were affected by nausea and vomiting, and 35% complained of dizziness and fainting.    All these symptoms are not related or caused by smoking aboard aircraft. Nor will a smoking ban of any length correct this fresh-air deficiency. Federal legislation calling for a study of the cabin environment led to a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study of existing data. While the NAS recommended a ban on smoking, it more importantly recommended federal agency oversight of the cabin, and safety and health issues.    The immediate solution is to force the airlines to operate all air packs during flight. Should full operation of the air packs be inadequate, smoking should be allowed only during specific periods. A staggered smoking period would allow airlines to accommodate all passengers.    Peter L. Trask   President   Aviation Safety andamp; Health Association    Honolulu   ---   Having flown as second officer on the Boeing 727 for a major airline, I can assure you that the shorter flights are not where the problem exists. It is those flights of two hours or more when smoking becomes a problem.    One need only look aft from the cockpit on a long flight and observe the cloud of thick smoke that extends the entire length of the passenger cabin to realize that there is no such thing as a non-smoking section. I have observed this gaseous and odorous cloud on numerous occasions when opening the door to allow a bleary-eyed flight attendant into the cockpit to take a couple of breaths of pure oxygen from the supplemental crew oxygen system before returning to the smoke-filled cabin.    The safety concern of smokers sneaking into the lavatory if smoking is banned has little validity, since all airliners are now equipped with lavatory smoke detectors.    James G.
