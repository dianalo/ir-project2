Some thrifts are planning to convert to coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to avoid higher annual premiums charged by the bank board's Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. The FSLIC's fees were raised recently to help pay for liquidation and assisted mergers of insolvent thrifts.    Currently, the board allows institutions that convert to FDIC insurance to retain membership in the Home Loan Bank System, which provides its members low interest loans.    The board, in explaining the decision to reconsider its policy, cited the 1982 Garn-St Germain Act, which said that thrifts leaving FSLIC coverage should be barred from Home Loan Bank membership for five years. A 1987 banking bill bars thrifts from leaving the FSLIC until Aug. 10. </TEXT></DOC>
