Federal authorities continued Sunday to investigate both theplane crash and Nir's visit to Uruapan, an out-of-the-way city inthe western mountains of Michoacan state famed for its avocados andnotorious for drug trafficking.   New revelations about Nir's role in the Iran-Contra affair,meanwhile, emerged Sunday in a Washington Post report quoting him assaying in June that a secret U.S.-Israeli agreement authorizedcounterterrorist operations he supervised with former White Houseaide Oliver North in 1985-86.   Nir, 37, was a counterterrorism adviser to Prime Minister ShimonPeres and his successor, Yitzhak Shamir.   In Jerusalem, the office of Peres, now foreign minister, deniedthe Washington Post report Sunday.   ``There is no such agreement,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman AlonLiel said in a statement. He declined to elaborate.   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, appearing on ABC-TV's``This Week with David Brinkley,'' was asked if such an agreementever existed.   ``Not that I know of,'' he replied.   Police here said they have no evidence that Nir's visit involvedanything but avocados. But they could not explain why he apparentlydecided to travel under an assumed name.   Jose Luis Arriaga, a Federal Judicial Police commander inUruapan, said Nir spent three days at the best hotel in town anddiscussed avocado prices with a French-owned exporter. Nir wastraveling on a visa issued Nov. 25 in London.   ``He came to solicit prices for avocados,'' Arriaga said.   He said Nir had planned to return to Uruapan in a week, possiblyto close a deal with the exporter Eupasa, a local subsidiary ofLucal France, a fruit and vegetable importer based in France.   When Nir left Uruapan on a charter flight he registered under anassumed name, Pat Weber. However, Arriaga said, Nir used his ownname at the hotel in Uruapan.   Arriaga said police obtained information about Nir's visit fromPedro Curchet, the local agent for Eupasa, which he said employsabout 50 people in an avocado-packing operation in Uruapan.   Curchet identified Nir's body in the wreckage of the Aerotaxis ofUruapan Cessna T-210 that went down Wednesday in the mountainsoutside Ciudad Hidalgo, about 110 miles west of Mexico City.   The pilot also died and three other people were seriouslyinjured. One was a Canadian woman, Adriana Stanton, 25, who said sheknew Nir only slightly and the others apparently were only sharingthe chartered flight.   Stanton told The Associated Press Thursday that she did not knowwhat Nir was doing in Mexico.   ``I don't know what his usual itinerary is. I don't know if hecomes to Mexico a lot,'' she said.   The Mexico City daily La Jornada said Saturday that Stanton wasalso traveling under an assumed name, Esther Arriaga. The newspaperdid not quote a source for the information.   Curchet was one of a party of about eight people from Argentinawho had been staying at the hillside hotel since September. Hotelpersonnel said they left Thursday or Friday.   They said Stanton arrived before Curchet and they did not know ifshe was working with him.   Hotel personnel and police who interviewed Curchet said the visitwas Nir's first. Curchet could not be located for comment, and theoffices of Eupasa in Uruapan were closed Sunday.   Arriaga said the investigation involves Mexican aviation expertsfrom Mexico City and the international police organization Interpol.   Israeli Embassy officials and friends of Nir in Israel have saidNir was in Mexico on a business trip but would not reveal the natureof the visit.   Arriaga said he did not know if Nir was acting as an independentbuyer or as an agent for an importer abroad.   In November, local avocado businessmen formed the Association ofProducers and Exporters to compete with the foreign exporters fromEupasa.   Federal authorities describe the region as critical to drugtrafficking. Marijuana is grown clandestinely and the mountains arepocked wtih secret airstrips for transporting drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
