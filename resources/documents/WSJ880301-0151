The crime: the theft of a valuable oil painting from the card room, replaced in its frame by a photographic copy.    The culprit? &quot;I've been waiting for one where the butler did it,&quot; says William Martin, art cop for the Los Angeles Police Department. And he and Interpol say that it looks as if the wait is over. &quot;It's like the game of Clue,&quot; Detective Martin adds.    The butler in question, Rune &quot;Roy&quot; Gunnar Donell, who is now in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial, has a different story. Asserts his lawyer, Donald Randolph: &quot;The butler didn't steal this painting. He was framed.&quot;    Mr. Donell's trial, due to start in a month or so, may run like an episode of &quot;Dallas,&quot; considering that the victims are multimillionaire oilman Howard Keck, former chairman of Superior Oil Co., and his wife, Elizabeth. The two have been embroiled in bitter divorce proceedings since before Mr. Donell's arrest.    Police claim that by the time the theft was reported last August, the 62-year-old butler, a Swedish national who had worked for the Kecks for 15 years, had already spirited the painting to Sweden and sold it at auction for more than $500,000.    Moreover, that painting -- an 1888 nude of a woman and child by the Swedish impressionist Anders Zorn -- is the second work stolen by Mr. Donell, the police charge. The other, they say, is a small French painting transported to Stockholm and auctioned for $6,000. Neither has been returned yet, pending negotiations by the State Department, Detective Martin says.    In the face of such charges, Mr. Randolph plans to try to prove that Mr. Donell sold both paintings at Mrs. Keck's request. He suggests that this explains why Mr. Donell returned to work for the Kecks for several months after selling the second painting (he eventually retired), and why he didn't hide the works from customs agents on his way to Sweden or conceal his identity from auction-house officials.    &quot;It is unbelievable what one person did to set up my client as the fall guy in this case,&quot; Mr. Randolph says, adding that the whereabouts of the money from the sales will come out during the trial. An attorney for Mrs. Keck responds: &quot;The position that Mrs. Keck would desire her painting be stolen is laughable. (Mr. Donell) is guilty, and he is obviously grasping at straws in terms of what defense he can use.&quot;    On second thought, maybe this belongs on &quot;People's Court.&quot; Stay tuned. </TEXT></DOC>
