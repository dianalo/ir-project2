This paper reports on the progress made toward achievingthe program goal of developing advanced technology to significantly reducefuel consumption and operating costs of future subsonic transport-typepropulsion systems. An additional goal was that the advanced conceptsbe compatible with future environmental regulations. Along with the resultsobtained, a brief overview of the design details of both the GeneralElectric and Pratt and Whitney energy efficient engines and the overallprogram scope are presented. Overall, this program has been highly successful;the technology developed during its course is, and will continue to be,effectively employed in both current and future advance transport aircraftengine designs. 9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
