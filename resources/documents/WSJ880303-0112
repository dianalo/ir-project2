The new policy, calling for the removal of &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of weapons, is designed to show the Western alliance's determination to address the Soviet Union's superiority in conventional arms. That superiority looms larger in the wake of the recent U.S.-Soviet accord to remove intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe -- weapons that were designed to compensate for Soviet superiority in conventional arms.    Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, announced the policy at a summit meeting here yesterday. The move came after NATO leaders spent most of the day applauding the unity of the alliance and carefully skirting issues of disagreement, such as the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons.    &quot;There are no great fundamental differences there,&quot; President Reagan told reporters after he emerged from closed meetings with leaders of the 16 NATO nations. &quot;I have never seen such harmony and togetherness as we have.&quot;    The conventional-arms initiative comes after NATO officials spent several months attempting to set an agenda for a complex new set of conventional arms-control talks. The negotiations, involving 35 nations, may begin next fall. They would replace a moribund, 15-year-old set of negotiations in Vienna that have focused on reducing troop levels in a small area of central Europe.    &quot;This document is a major step forward for the alliance,&quot; President Reagan said. He asserted that the most direct threat to stability in Europe consists of the Soviet Union's arsenal, which &quot;far exceeds its defense needs.&quot;    The agreement is also intended to get NATO out ahead of anticipated proposals for conventional cuts by Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose arms-control initiatives over the past year or so have given him a major propaganda advantage in Europe and left the Western alliance largely reacting.    Yesterday's NATO statement said a priority in the new talks would be to eliminate &quot;the capability for launching surprise attack and for initiating large-scale offensive action.&quot; The negotiations would focus on weapons systems such as tanks and artillery and logistical items, such as portable bridging equipment that allows an army to move forward quickly and hold territory. The discussions would cover a much larger area, extending from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.    The NATO statement also suggests an effort to reduce Soviet forces based in central Europe would be a key to increased military stability in the area. &quot;I wouldn't underestimate how difficult this is going to be,&quot; one U.S. official said. He noted that success of the new plan requires lopsided reductions by the Soviets.    NATO officials believe the time is ripe for the new reduction talks because both the Warsaw Pact and NATO will have increasing difficulty modernizing their conventional forces in coming months. Mr. Gorbachev has suggested he is willing to make reductions to a level of &quot;military sufficiency&quot; to provide more money for economic reforms. And after several years of increased defense budgets, the U.S. and other NATO nations are entering a new period of fiscal austerity that will require deeper cuts into weapons programs.    One complication involving the new talks will be the inclusion of 12 neutral nations in Europe that don't belong to either the Warsaw Pact or NATO. Another will be verification. Up to this point, a method hasn't been found that can fully account for key weapons such as tanks.    The Warsaw Pact has 52,200 tanks, compared with NATO's 22,200, and 37,000 artillery pieces, compared with NATO's 11,000, according to the Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The institute issues an annual report on the military balance in Europe.    Soviet negotiators likely will propose reductions in the areas of attack aircraft and armed helicopters, where NATO forces are more nearly equal. </TEXT></DOC>
