The armed forces press office listed 88 rebels killed and 117wounded in September and said 65 soldiers died and 141 were wounded.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontclaimed to have inflicted 1,062 casualties on forces of theU.S.-backed government last month, which saw the beginning of arebel drive called ``Death to Reagan's (Salvador) Policy, Yankeeout of El Salvador.''   Radio Venceremos, the rebels' clandestine radio, said the deathsof 78 troops was confirmed.   The rebels do not usually provide figures on their owncasualties.   Guerrillas early Monday attacked a branch of the state-run BancoCapitalizador in Atiquizaya, 42 miles west of San Salvador, thearmed forces said.   A communique said the branch was sacked and burned in thepre-dawn raid, and that two national policemen were woundedfighting the rebels.   Bank manager Francisco Rodriguez told journalists the guerrillastook about $48,000.   The communique also reported that government forces kIlled fiverebels and wounded two in fighting Sunday in northeastern Morazanprovince.   No way exists to independently verify casualty figures reportedby either side in the 9-year-old war. Evidence indicates both sidesinflate the number of casualties inflicted on the enemy, whileunderreporting their own casualties. Radio Venceremos said 450soldiers were killed or wounded in what it described as the``annihilation'' of the 4th Army Brigade headquarters inChalatenango province on Sept. 13.   Reporters who visited the brigade that day saw damage from rebelmortar fire but no evidence the base had been overrun. Thegovernment said 15 soldiers and six guerrillas were killed in thatattack.   The guerrilla claim for September was nearly double that ofAugust, when the rebels said they caused 544 government casualties.   Rebel reports do not separate dead and wounded.   About 65,000 people have died in the war, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
