<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0644 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of separating the water, produced in the coking process duringthe cooling of the hot crude gas in the receiver and the preliminarycondensers into a small fraction which is rich in salt and a large fractionwhich is impoverished in salt characterised in that, (a) after it hasbeen cooled in the receiver, the crude gas is firstly guided throughan electrostatic filter before it enters the preliminary condensers forfurther cooling, (b) the condensate from the receiver and the dischargefrom the electrostatic filter are combined in the tar separator, (c)the condensate from the preliminary condensers is recirculated in partinto the receiver cycle while the remainder is subsequently treated asa fraction which is impoverished in salt, (d) the aqueous phase fromthe tar separator is subsequently treated in part as a fraction whichis rich in salt.</TEXT></DOC>
