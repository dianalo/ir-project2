Madrid's general stock index, which uses its Jan. 1, 1986, level as a base of 100, closed at a high of 294.57 Tuesday, its seventh record finish in a row. At its high, the index was up almost 46% since this year's nadir at about 202 May 8. On Friday the index closed at 286.95, up 3.65.    Now a high of 350 looks attainable by year end, says Alvaro Llanza, an analyst at the brokerage firm Investcorp. S.A., although the speed of the recent ascent leaves the market vulnerable to a short-term correction.    Spanish individuals only have about 10% of their wealth tied up in equities, according to Investcorp.'s estimate, and attempts to increase that share should bolster the market, the firm says.    &quot;There is a lot of liquidity in the market, mostly from local investors moving out of government bonds,&quot; says Monica Morales, an Investcorp. director.    &quot;Furthermore, there are no indications of long-term selling,&quot; Ms. Morales says. &quot;People are restructuring their portfolios but staying in the equity market.&quot;    Meanwhile, Spain's economy and its budding capital market should expand rapidly as the country integrates itself into the Common Market, analysts say. And that twin expansion should help sustain the interest of foreign investors, they say.    Spain's economic growth, currently at an annualized rate of about 4%, should outpace the rest of Europe for at least the next five years, providing a solid foundation for stocks, says Richard Robinson, senior investment manager at the Kuwait Investment Office in London.    The economic indicators are looking good, local analysts agree. The inflation rate stood at 4.9% in June, and most analysts expect it to hover around the government's target of 5% for the year.    At the same time, interest rates should fall as the government slows growth in the money supply, analysts say. The overnight interbank rate, which stands at about 18%, down from a peak of 22% in February, should ease to 12% by year end, Investcorp. says.    Telefonica Nacional de Espana, the state-controlled telecommunications giant, should continue to lead the market as it has in recent months, analysts say. Telefonica has attracted healthy foreign demand following its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in June.    The company's stock surged in Madrid almost 44% after the listing to a high of 250 Monday. It closed at 247, up 10, Friday. Telefonica's shares, like other Spanish stocks, are quoted as a percentage of par rather than in pesetas, or cash.    Many analysts also recommend construction stocks. The Barcelona Olympic games and Seville's universal trade fair in 1992 should give a big boost to the sector, says Belen Sanchez Cortes, an analyst at brokerage firm Benito y Monjardin. In particular, cement companies Portland Valderrivas and Asland are well-managed and have solid prospects for growth, Ms. Sanchez Cortes says.    Auto makers also have good potential for growth because Spain's car pool is considerably older than the rest of Europe's, analysts say. Ms. Sanchez Cortes recommends Citroen Hispania, which is expected to have a 150% jump in sales and record profits this year, and Fasa-Renault.    While rumors of takeover bids have boosted some issues recently, many analysts believe the speculation has produced some overvalued stocks -- Explosivos Rio Tinto, in particular.    The chemical and fertilizer giant's stock surged recently amid rumors that the Kuwait Investment Office, or KIO, was seeking control. While Barcelona-based paper company Torras Hostench, which is 36%-owned by the KIO, has acquired a 15% stake in Explosivos Rio Tinto, the KIO itself doesn't have a direct stake or intend to acquire one, says the office's Mr. Robinson. On Friday Explosivos Rio Tinto rose 37.25 to 783.25 -- far less than its high of 910, reached July 27.    Analysts also advise investors to avoid most banks. The sharp rise in interbank rates earlier this year appears to have taken a toll on some large banks that were caught short of funds and had to borrow.    On the other hand, some smaller banks appeared to have caught the upward trend and lent in the interbank market during the period of high rates. Banco Popular Espanol and Banco de Andalucia benefited from the rise in rates, says Ms. Morales of Investcorp.    ---   London and Tokyo Stocks   London stock prices fell across the board Friday but closed above the day's lows, as jitters persisted in the market following Thursday's full percentage-point jump in U.K. banks' base lending rates.    At one point Friday the 100-share index, which fell a record 56 points Thursday, was down 65, but it recovered somewhat to finish down 35.2 points at 2226.2. The Financial Times 30-share index was down 27.2 at 1726.9. Volume rose to 923 million shares from 832.3 million Thursday.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average rose 142.72 points to 24800.95. The first section index was up 11.56 at 2041.49. Turnover totaled 650 million shares, up from 600 million Thursday. Gainers outnumbered losers 508 to 376, while 137 issues were unchanged.    Some domestic-demand dependent issues drifted higher, while most export-led stocks edged lower, traders said.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Aug 6      Aug 5      Year   U.S. ....................... 299.3      295.7     +31.2   Britain .................... 676.8      694.2     +36.0   Canada ..................... 451.1      451.5     +35.4   Japan ..................... 1205.7     1189.3     +27.6   France ..................... 421.1      417.6     + 3.2   Germany .................... 250.9      248.1     - 3.4   Hong Kong ................. 2502.9     2523.8     +40.7   Switzerland ................ 207.3      204.5     + 3.2   Australia .................. 389.4      388.5     +47.5   World index ................ 466.8      463.4     +30.8</TEXT></DOC>
