The Afghan News Agency, an organ of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrillas,said guerrillas also shot down a military transport plane and aMiG-27 jet fighter with a U.S. Stinger missile.   There was no independent confirmation of the reports.   The guerrillas said they captured 168 soldiers of the Afghanarmy's 20th Division in fighting Saturday along the strategic SalangHighway. They said about 80 others were captured in other areas ofAfghanistan, but did not specify when or where.   Guerrillas reportedly have blocked portions of the 240-mileSalang Highway, which is a key supply route from the Soviet borderto the Afghan capital of Kabul.   Two pilots defected with two Mi-35 helicopter gunships on Tuesdayin central Kapisa province, northeast of the capital, the agencysaid.   The agency said guerrillas also shot down two planes _ atransport plane near the southeastern city of Kandahar and a MiGfighter in the western province of Farah.   A rival rebel group said Sunday that three communist regiments,or about 10,000 troops, have surrendered to the resistance innorthern Afghanistan since Soviet troops completed their militarypullout on Feb. 15.   The Soviets had intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, oneyear after a communist coup prompted the Moslem guerrilla revolt.   About 250,000 government security forces hold key Afghan citiesbut are encircled by the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who control most ofthe countryside.   Guerrilla leaders predict that communist troops soon will defectin numbers large enough to cause the Kabul government to fall.   In another development, a French nurse with the humanitarian aidgroup Medecins Du Monde died in an avalanche southwest of Kabul, anorganization official said Wednesday.   The Medecins Du Monde spokesman, who asked not to be identified,said Kristof Cany, a male nurse, and an 18-year-old Afghan assistantdied Sunday in Afghanistan's central Wardak province.   The two were walking between the Medecins Du Monde clinic andliving quarters when the snow roared down the mountain, thespokesman said.   Four French nationals worked at the clinic, which has beentreating war wounded for more than two years.   Cany, 26, went to Afghanistan in October and was scheduled toreturn to France this month. He was from Carmaux, France.   The French spokesman said Cany's death is the first sinceMedecins Du Monde began operating in Afghanistan in 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
