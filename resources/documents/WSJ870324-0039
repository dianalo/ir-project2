CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBMCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp., which has lost market share to Digital Equipment Corp., said it will move up by two months the deliveries of its new midrange computers.    IBM announced its strategically important 9370 computers last October and, in the face of customer concern about the lateness of delivery dates, has made a major push to bring them to market as quickly as possible.    Analysts and consultants have generally praised the machines and said they should at least slow Digital's progress with IBM customers, though some said Digital still has significant advantages in the software available for midrange machines.    &quot;The 9370 is probably going to be a banner product for IBM,&quot; said Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, a longtime bear on IBM.    IBM said the low-end 9370 Model 20 and the Model 60 will be available in July; it had earlier promised delivery only by the end of the third quarter. Shipments of the Model 40 and the high-end Model 90 will start in October; previously, delivery had been promised only by year-end.    The machines are important to IBM because they use the same architecture and some of the same basic software as IBM's mainframes, making it easier for the machines to talk to each other and for users to move from one type of machine to another. Largely because of Digital's common architecture, Annex Research said Digital's share of the U.S. market for midrange computers jumped to 41.3% in 1986 from 23% in 1985 while IBM's share tumbled to 29.1% from 51.9%.    IBM has said it has received tens of thousands of orders for 9370s, and analysts generally put the number at 40,000 to 45,000. The analysts said, though, that many customers placed those orders just to get in line for an early delivery and could still withdraw the orders without penalty if the 9370 doesn't seem to meet expectations.    &quot;We view 1987 as a pilot year,&quot; said Steve Cohen, an analyst at Gartner Group. &quot;You know, 'Let's put one or two in our (computer services) department and kick the tires a bit.'&quot;    Still, Mr. Cohen said he conservatively estimates that IBM will ship 6,000 units this year and 15,000 next year. Depending on the configuration the customer chooses, a 9370 typically costs $100,000 to $250,000.    Consultants said IBM achieved performance gains by using some impressive technology to package the chips more densely inside the machine. Better packaging also allowed IBM to pack the innards into a smaller box, making the machines more appropriate for use in a small office.    &quot;I think elegance is the right word to use for its design,&quot; said Amy Wohl, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consultant.    In addition, IBM made it much easier to install the machine and maintain it without having experts on the premises. For instance, IBM said the basic software can be installed in five to six hours now, compared with 45 hours for versions of that software designed for mainframes.    United Airlines, which has developed a system for travel agents that will run on 9370s, is enthusiastic about the new machines because they provide enough power to do departmental-level computing and yet resemble IBM's mainframes.    Barry Kotar, vice president of Apollo Services, a unit of UAL Inc.'s United Airlines subsidiary, said he will order hundreds of 9370s. &quot;Let's put it this way,&quot; he said, &quot;if it goes into the thousands I have a huge success on my hands, and there's no reason why it can't.&quot;    Richard Stuckey, a partner in Arthur Andersen's Technical Services Organization, a consulting group, said: &quot;The 9370 will certainly slow the rate at which Digital has been getting into IBM shops, which has been just staggering of late. But I don't think it'll stop it by any means.&quot;    He said IBM needs to do more to improve the machines' ability to talk to each other. Other analysts said the machines need better database capabilities and need to remove some of the complexity from the operating system, the computer's internal traffic cop. In addition, analysts said IBM needs to make the machines easier to use.    &quot;There's obviously more to come on the 9370,&quot; said Mr. Cohen of Gartner Group. &quot;It's sort of a leapfrog game.&quot;    An IBM spokeswoman dismissed the concerns about software as misguided. &quot;We've said all along that the 9370 is easy to use, and from our perspective it is,&quot; she said.    In any case, Digital professed little concern about the 9370. It has improved its service package to match changes IBM made, and recently announced three new versions of its midrange computers, but Ken Olsen, Digital's president, said he had little time for talk about the 9370.    Queried about the 9370 at a Digital product announcement in January, he said: &quot;Some people call it a hot machine. Some people say it's two years too late. Me, I don't think about it much.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM was actively traded and closed at $149.75, up $1.125, on volume of nearly 2.2 million shares. </TEXT></DOC>
