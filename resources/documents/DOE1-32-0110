<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0110 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spectral efficiencies of energy dispersive Si(Li) photon countershave been measured using the storage ring BESSY as a radiometric standardsource of extremely low photon flux of the order of 1 photon/s eV). Thedetectors were irradiated with white synchrotron radiation when the storagering was operated with only about 5 electrons stored. For energy calibrationand measurement of the energy resolution X-ray emission lines excitedby a 55-Fe source were used. Towards lower photon energies the efficiencyis drastically decreased by the building-up of an ice-layer on the permanentlycooled detector. By this surface contamination also the energy resolutionof the detector is affected. The performance of detector can be recoveredby a warming-up procedure.</TEXT></DOC>
