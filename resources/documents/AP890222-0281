(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The York Dispatch and York Daily Recordannounced Wednesday they are asking for a joint operating agreementthat would unite the business and production functions of the twonewspapers.   The York market is one of the smallest in the nation where twonewspapers owned by different companies are in direct competition.   Under the proposal, filed with the U.S. Justice Department,editorial departments of the Record and The Dispatch would remainseparate and under control of the respective newspapers. YorkNewspapers Inc., publisher of the Dispatch, would also retaineditorial control over its Sunday newspaper, the York Sunday News.   Business functions such as advertising, circulation and printingwould be provided by a new, integrated enterprise, the YorkNewspaper Co., according to a joint statement.   Under the proposal, the Record, published by the York DailyRecord Inc. and owned by the Buckner News Alliance, would publishMonday through Saturday mornings. The Dispatch, owned by GardenState Newspapers Inc., would publish Monday through Fridayafternoons.   Asked whether The Dispatch would cease its morning, weekdayedition under the joint agreement, Anthony F. Tierno, Garden Statevice president, responded, ``not necessarily.''   The Record would cease to publish its Sunday edition, but wouldpublish on all holidays. The Dispatch would cease publication onholidays and on Saturday.   The York Sunday News would continue unchanged. The Dispatchpurchased the Sunday News from Lancaster Newspapers Inc. last year.   According to the statement, ``financial hardship'' was the reasonfor combining the business functions of the two daily newspapers.   Implementation of the proposed agreement is contingent on theapproval of the U.S. Attorney General's Office. If approved, theagreement would be put in place as soon as practical, the statementsaid.   Similar joint operating agreements are in place in 20 U.S. cities.   Tierno said he was unsure how long the review would take butnoted the Justice Department has sometimes taken as long as threeyears to make decisions involving other papers.   ``It's clear in the agreement that both of us have said we willcontinue to compete until the (agreement) is voted yes or no. Atthat point, we will make whatever decisions have to be made,'' hesaid.   According to ABC figures reported in the 1988 directory of thePennsylvania Newspaper Publishers's Association, the Record had adaily circulation of 40,408 and a Sunday circulation of 38,328.   The Dispatch listed a daily circulation of 48,310; the YorkSunday News had a circulation of 42,482.   Garden State Newspapers Inc. is an affiliate of MediaNewsHoldings Inc. of Houston.
