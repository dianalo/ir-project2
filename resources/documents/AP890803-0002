(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The family of hostage Joseph Cicippioexpressed renewed relief Thursday that his kidnappers in Lebanonhad suspended their threat of execution, but one brother said hewas heartbroken by Cicippio's appearence.   ``Really after seeing that picture today I fell apart. That wasnot the brother I knew ... four or five years ago, three yearsago,'' said Anthony Cicippio, speaking from a neighbor's house inan interview on CNN's Larry King Live show.   ``He's changed considerably, his face is drawn in, his eyes areshrunken, he looks like he's malnutritioned. I really cried todaywhen I saw that picture. ... It was really a pathetic picture of mybrother.''   Cicippio's Lebanese captors on Thursday released a videotapedplea from Cicippio, who called for the release of a Shiite Moslemcleric kidnapped by the Israelis and added: ``Don't be late ...because they are very serious.''   After learning that the Revolutionary Justice Organization hadsuspended plans to execute Cicippio, another brother, ThomasCicippio, brightened and relaxed.   ``This is very good news for the Cicippio family. We are happyand delighted,'' he said before a battery of microphones on hisfront lawn.   Joseph Cicippio's son David said he was relieved but added:   ``Our government has to find a solution for this crisis. Wecan't just keep on reacting to things when they happen.   ``The last 50 hours have been very devastating. I hope we neverhave to go through this again.''   The tense situation began Monday when Israel refused to freeSheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem religious leader capturedby Israeli commandos last week and taken to Israel.   In retaliation, the captors of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. WilliamHiggins, member of a U.N. peacekeeping force, said they hangedtheir hostage Monday. That was followed by threats againstCicippio's life.   After heavy international pressure, including a plea fromCicippio's Lebanese wife, his kidnappers postponed their Tuesdaydeath sentence for 48 hours and finally suspended it.   Thomas Cicippio said he wanted to see the momentum ofnegotiations continue.   ``Other governments are involved right now; I'm not sure whothey are. I'm more hopeful now than ever, since this has gotten somuch attention,'' he said.   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, from thecampus of American University of Beirut, where he was actingcomptroller.   On Thursday, his captors released a videotape of him pleadingfor the United States to pressure Israel into releasing the Shiitecleric.   Thomas Cicippio read a telex he had sent to his sister-in-law,Elham, in Lebanon: ``At a time like this, we are all together inmind and heart. We are with you in our feelings. Have faith. Wewill not give up hope. Keep your spirits high.''   As the family retreated inside the house, Joseph Cicippio Jr.paused in the doorway.   He said the family did not plan to celebrate the suspension ofthe death threat. ``We'll just have a sigh of relief at thispoint,'' he said. ``We'll hold up the celebration for when my dad'shere.''</TEXT></DOC>
