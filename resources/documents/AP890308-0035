Bush on Tuesday responded to news reports that his administrationis adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing asavings and loan rescue plan, meeting with foreign leaders andpresenting a budget package to Congress.   ``My response is it's not adrift and there isn't malaise,'' hesaid. ``I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to bebubbling around, that nothing is happening. A lot is happening. Notall of it good, but a lot is happening.''   Bush, in an impromptu news conference, also reiterated hisopposition to White House intervention in the Eastern Airlinesstrike. He said pilots threatening a slowdown to support thestriking machinists should not ``make the innocent traveling publica pawn in this dispute.''   Bush continued to stand by Tower, as he picked up a piece of goodnews in the Senate fight over confirmation _ a second Democrat, Sen.Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, announced he would vote for thenominee.   ``I believe he is the best man for the job,'' the president saidof Tower. ``I'm not going to pull back on this.''   He noted that Tower has pledged not to take another drink ifconfirmed, and said, ``You'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagonmaking sure that's true.''   To counter allegations that his administration is stalled, Bushcited a phone conversation with a friend in Lubbock, Texas, who toldhim, ``All the people in Lubbock think things are going just great.''   The friend was campaign contributor Robert Blake, an oil and gasbusinessman and longtime friend of Bush.   ``I think we're on track,'' Bush said.   Bush was responding to news reports that the uphill Towerconfirmation fight has diverted attention from other administrationbusiness, particularly appointment of key personnel, and that aftersix weeks Bush's presidency is floundering.   Bush said he would like to see his appointments move morequickly, but he claimed that he is ahead of where the Reaganadministration was on appointments at this point in 1981.   He acknowledged that trouble in getting a defense secretaryconfirmed was ``an inhibiting factor'' in completing a strategicreview on defense but said, ``I hope there's not going to be anyslippage'' in meeting a May 10 deadline.   Bush also said he has ``total confidence'' in his White Housechief of staff, John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor whohas been criticized for alleged tactical errors in the Towernomination struggle.   On other subjects, Bush said:   _He has directed his nominee for drug policy coordinator, WilliamBennett, to look into ways to block criminal use of semiautomaticassault guns. The president, a member of the National RifleAssociation, previously said he opposed banning such weapons. But hesaid he told Bennett he would take a hard look at any ``sensibleanswer'' the drug czar proposes.   _There ``has to be some linkage'' between U.S. policy toward theSoviets and the Kremlin's behavior in Central America. Reiteratingthat he will push at the end of this month for new humanitarian aidfor the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, Bush indicated he is looking tothe Soviets to pull back on their military aid to the rulingSandinista government there.   _He is as committed to human rights as former President Reaganwas, though Bush didn't publicly focus on the issue even whenChinese authorities prevented the nation's leading dissident fromattending a dinner Bush invited him to in Beijing. Bush said ``quietdiscussion'' is the best way to voice human rights concerns.   He did not mention Chinese actions in Tibet, where demonstratorsare protesting Chinese occupation and report widespread human rightsabuses.</TEXT></DOC>
