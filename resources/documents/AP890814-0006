The first trip through the man-made shortcut between theAtlantic and the Pacific was made by the steamer Ancon on August15, 1914, a voyage nearly lost in the rush of history as World WarI began in Europe.   ``We made Panama the gateway to the world,'' said Arnold Small,99, who came from Barbados in 1911 to work on the canal and is oneof the few surviving workers.   The waterway made Panama an international trading center but italso tied Panama to the United States, which guaranteed the youngcountry's independence from Colombia in 1903 in return for a chunkof territory to build the canal.   Ten years of work followed as a labor force that reached 36,000built dams and locks, conquered yellow fever and malaria and sawedthrough Gold Hill, now the peak of Culebra Cut, also known as theGailliard Cut for its chief engineer.   The Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty of 1903 created a little America inthe 10-mile wide Canal Zone, with its own courts, police, stamps,stores and lifestyle.   It was also a land of high salaries for Americans and low wagesfor Panamanians, a land where the racial segregation of theAmerican South was imposed.   That history is still being used by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegaand the Panamanian government to whip up anti-U.S. sentiment.   In 1977, President Jimmy Carter and the late Panamanian dictatorOmar Torrijos signed the treaties that eliminated the Canal Zoneand called for the United States to give up all rights to the canalit built and maintained at noon on Dec. 31, 1999.   Noriega claims the United States plans to renege on itscommitment to turn the canal over to Panama and close down itsmilitary bases. As commander of the Defense Forces, Noriega is defacto ruler of Panama although he has been indicted in the UnitedStates on drug charges.   ``The canal has been good and bad for us,'' said Panamanianhistorian Carlos Bolivar Pedreschi in an interview. ``It helped usattain independence and created an efficient class ofadministrators. But then the United States also created andsupported a Panamanian military class that, claiming it mustprepare to protect the canal, has suppressed the democraticforces.''   After 75 years the canal is working as well as ever. In 1988more than 12,300 ships _ about 211 million tons _ passed through,paying out more than $340 million in tolls.   And traffic is increasing in both number and volume as more andmore ships are built to the maximum the canal can take _ the locksare 1,000 feet long, 110 feet wide.   Ships are lifted 85 feet from one ocean and deposited again inthe other through the locks, whose level rises or descendsdepending on the ship's direction.   In between, the ships sail through nine narrow miles at CulebraCut and cross Gatun Lake, 138 square miles of fresh water formed bya dam across the Chagres River.   While the importance of the canal to the United States has beenreduced by air and highways over the ``land bridge'' between Eastand West Coasts and by the increased size of the U.S. Navy, 14percent of U.S. maritime trade still moves through the locks.   The canal is increasingly being used by Japanese, Korean andother Far Eastern nations to export to the United States, Europeand Latin America. Asia-East Coast trade accounts for 45 percent ofcanal traffic by itself.   And while the volume is lower, the canal is vital to economicdevelopment in Latin American nations; the canal route from Peru tothe East Coast is 6,200 miles shorter than sailing around Cape Hornat the tip of South America.   ``Far into the 21st century, the canal will continue to be animportant route for many countries,'' said Deputy AdministratorFernando Manfredo, the highest-ranking Panamanian on the PanamaCanal Commission.   In the past two years the United States used its control to putpressure on the Panamanian government to oust Noriega. Theshort-term outlook is for more confrontation.   U.S. forces, charged with defense of the canal, often carry outmaneuvers on Panamanian soil as a show of force. The short-termoutlook is for more confrontation.   The U.S. government, which operates the waterway through thePanama Canal Commission, has withheld more than $100 million incanal tolls from the government of Panama.   The Canal Commission's adminstrator is a U.S. citizen and thedeputy adminstrator a Panamanian, roles that are to reverse Jan. 1,according to the Carter-Torrijos treaties.   But the United States is not likely to approve a Panamanianlinked to Noriega and Noriega is unlikely to nominate Manfredo, whomight gain approval.   ``You will have a deputy U.S. administrator running the canal,''Manfredo said.   Nevertheless, the canal will remain for a long time Panama'smain natural resource, according to Pedreschi.   U.S. agencies involved in the operation of the canal paid morethan $224 million in wages and salaries to employees in 1988. Inaddition, more than $200 milion went into the Panamanian economy aspayment for services, for direct purchases and for construction.   Manfredo said that for the next 20 years canal traffic shouldregister a sustained growth of 2 percent annually, ``if the canalis run efficiently and there are no exaggerated canal tollincreases, and if there are no political problems.''   Manfredo says the Panamanians have the capacity to run andimprove the canal, pointing to ongoing work to control mudslides atGold Hill.   The canal still arouses intense emotion among some in the UnitedStates who believe that it should never be given up, but most U.S.canal workers are reconciled to the fact.   The work force of about 7,500 is 85 percent Panamanian. Onevital engineering area, the locks division, is 100 percentPanamanian. Slowest to change have been the pilots, where 58 of 238are Panamanian.</TEXT></DOC>
