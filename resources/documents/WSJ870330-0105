The Senate voted 79-11 for the measure, which allows the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to borrow as much as $7.5 billion over two years in the bond market and gives the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more options in dealing with failing banks.    In addition, the bill would bar the Federal Reserve Board from granting banks any new securities, insurance or real estate powers until March 1, 1988, place restrictions on limited-service banks and limit the time institutions may hold a depositor's check before making the funds available for withdrawal.    The House is considering separate bills to do some of the same things. The moratorium on new bank powers and the curbs on limited-service banks, however, are not part of the House bills, and some lawmakers fear that those controversial provisions could delay the assistance to the FSLIC. Before passing the legislation Friday, the Senate rejected 54-35 an attempt by Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) to remove those sections.    Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) indicated he may yield on those sections if they threaten the measure when the Senate and House meet to reconcile their differences.    &quot;If necessary we will go only with a FSLIC recapitalization,&quot; Mr. Proxmire told his colleagues during Senate debate Friday. &quot;We're going to push it just as hard and as fast as we possibly can . . . We have to move on the FSLIC recap, no question about it.&quot;    To raise funds for the FSLIC, the legislation would create a financing corporation that would borrow as much as $3.75 billion each year for two years by selling long-term bonds. Those securities would be backed by zero-coupon bonds, purchased with as much as $2.2 billion from the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.    Since last year, the Reagan administration has sought a five-year, $15-billion borrowing authority for the FSLIC. Treasury Department officials said they would recommend that President Reagan veto any FSLIC bill with a lower figure because it would be insufficient.    But some thrift executives fear that if the fund gets $15 billion, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, would move too aggressively; they contend the Bank Board not only would close institutions that are beyond hope, but also would shut those that could work themselves out of problems.    The FSLIC, which insures $900 billion in deposits in 3,200 federally insured thrifts, has been declared insolvent by government auditors. The Bank Board estimates it would cost $23.5 billion to resolve the current problems of troubled thrifts.    A House Banking subcommittee is to consider a funding plan for the FSLIC beginning tomorrow.    The measure also would make it easier for the FDIC to arrange the purchase of a bank that is failing but hasn't yet closed. Currently, the agency must wait until an institution is shut before arranging its sale. In addition, the FDIC would be allowed to establish a new institution to take over the operations of a failed bank for as long as three years while the agency seeks a permanent buyer.    The bill would also revive a law giving the FDIC emergency powers to arrange interstate sales of failed banks. The law, which was passed in 1982 and expired last Oct. 13, would be reinstated through March 1990.    These expanded powers could save the FDIC as much as $400 million each year the law is in effect by giving the agency more options when institutions founder, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.    In other action before passing the legislation, the Senate agreed, by a voice vote, to an amendment offered by Mr. Garn that would allow limited-service banks to purchase failed or failing thrifts.    Also by a voice vote, the Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) directing the FDIC, Bank Board, Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and Justice and Labor departments to study banks' and thrifts' investments in high-yield, low-quality securities, also known as junk bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
