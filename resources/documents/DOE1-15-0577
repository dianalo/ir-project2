The study is a part of thetotal inventory of the peat resources of Finland that Geological Surveyis undertaking. In this report the material collected in the year 1985is been dealt with. The main goal of the studies is to located the peatresources with industrial interest main emphasis beeing on fuel peatproduction. Anyway, also other important ways to use mires are takeninto account, including conservation and recreation. The detailed surveyon a peatland was made using a survey line grid where the main line wasrun through the long axis of the deposit and through its center. A numberof secondary lines were made perpendicular to the main line at 400 mintervals. The study sites were staked out at 100 m intervals. Depthmeasurements were made at 50 m intervals. The following surface characteristicswere studied and recorded at each stake: The cover type and wetness ofmire, the amount and height of peat mounds and the density, size andquality of trees. After that the peat deposit was sampled from the surfaceto the bottom to determine the type, fibrousity, wetness and the degreeof humification of peat. The amount of snags in the deposit was determinedby pushing a two meters long rod ten times into the ground. Laboratorysamples were taken from selected sites to determine the pH-value, ashcontent, heating value, and bulk density of peat. Altogether 766 ha ofmires were evaluated good for fuel peat production. This is 18% of thesurveyed area of 4 252 ha. The amount of useful pea is 13.9 million cubicmeters in situ. The energy content is 25.2 million GJ or 7.1 millionMWh.</TEXT></DOC>
