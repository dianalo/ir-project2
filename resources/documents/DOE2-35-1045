The temperature evolution and thermal transfersin the soil are modelized in and around the quarry filled with hot water.It appears that the thermal load is well preserved but the output temperaturewhen the water is recuperated is too low to allow direct utilization.A heat pump is still suitable.</TEXT></DOC>
