On the balance sheet, incentive costs come directly out of NorthAmerican operations. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. haveprofitable overseas operations, especially in Europe, but ChryslerCorp. doesn't.   Consequently, Chrysler's earnings could take a big hit when theBig Three report their earnings during the week of Oct. 23.   Incentive costs, sometimes called marketing expenses, have beenheavy during the second and third quarters of 1989 for the BigThree. Each embarked on extensive rebate and low-interest financingprograms as the second quarter began and continued them through thethird quarter, mostly to remove built up inventories before the1990 model year began Oct. 1.   ``You know what's a killer? Marketing expenses, which could beas high as $1,000 a car,'' said analyst Kathleen Heaney of NikkoSecurities Co. International Inc. of New York City.   Analysts estimates of third-quarter earnings vary greatly, buteach is significantly lower for each company compared to the samethree-month period a year ago. During the third quarter of 1988,the Big Three earned a combined $1.83 billion, or $3.51 a share, topost the best third quarter in history.   This year, combined earnings should be somewhere around $1.02billion, or about $1.95 a share, analysts figures show. That's down44.3 percent.   ``It's not going to be a pretty quarter,'' said analyst DouglasLaughlin of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. of New York.   He attributed nearly all the sour performance to North Americanoperations, as did independent analyst David Healy.   ``I think chances are that a break even or loss in NorthAmerican operations will affect all three,'' Healy said.   Even though incentives eat into profits, none of the Big Threeare shying away from them so far in the fourth quarter. GM, Fordand Chrysler have offered rebates, low-interest financing orspecialized promotions nationwide and regionally for 1989 and 1990cars.   Some of the programs were introduced on 1990 vehicles evenbefore the cars and trucks officially went on sale.   Less profitable North American operations affect not only thebalance sheet for the corporation but profit sharing for thecompanies' workers. Each contract between a Big Three automaker andthe United Auto Workers union contains a formula for figuringprofit sharing checks for the workers.   The amount of the check is directly related to the profitabilityof a company's operations in North America.</TEXT></DOC>
