Delbert C. Staley, chairman and chief executive officer, said Nynex is still &quot;on track&quot; with internal profit-growth projections made before the stock market plunge in October. Mr. Staley declined to predict the size of this year's expected profit rise.    The telecommunications concern has many big customers in the financial-services industry, so it did experience some &quot;softening&quot; late last year, Mr. Staley acknowledged in an interview. But he said a pickup in the manufacturing sector has enabled the company to make up for the financial-services weakness. Moreover, the generally robust economy of Nynex's New England Telephone Co. territory has helped offset sluggish conditions in the New York and Boston financial communities.    To help improve earnings, Nynex is continuing to look for ways to reduce costs, mainly by consolidating duplicate operations. For example, the company last year combined the payroll, billing and operator services of its two telephone operating companies, New England Telephone and New York Telephone Co.    In addition, Nynex plans to introduce several new services that are expected bolster earnings in 1989, including automatic meter reading for utilities, voice mail and message storage, and various telephone network applications.    Nynex is particularly interested in acquiring businesses that would expand its computer software and cellular telephone operations, Mr. Staley said.    He said Nynex is also shopping for a company that would provide an entry into the integrated solutions market. &quot;Our customers more and more need help integrating their computer and telephone networks,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to provide them with that help.&quot;    While saying that he wants to expand Nynex's cellular business, Mr. Staley stressed that the company will buy cellular properties, as well as any other operations, only if they are &quot;priced right.&quot;    Meanwhile, Nynex plans to spend $2.6 billion this year on upgrading and developing its telecommunications network, the same as in 1987. As part of that program, Nynex said it will install 87,400 miles of optical-fiber cable, expanding that network by about 45% to 282,400 miles.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Nynex closed at $62.25, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
