Dealers said the market was directionless as investors wereunable to decide whether they should buy or sell amid politicaluncertainties ahead of a July 23 parliamentary election despite thedownward trend in the U.S. interest rates.   It is widely expected that the ruling Liberal Democratic Partywill lose badly in the upcoming upper house election, hurt by aninfluence-pedddling stock scandal, an unpopular 3 percentconsumption tax and Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's reportedinvolvement with paid mistresses.   Investors are reluctant to buy due to fears that the LDP'selection loss will result in a market plunge.   A dealer with New Japan Securities Co. said the index fellsharply within 30 minutes of morning trading, when foreign investorssold spot issues and bought futures issues in arbitrage deals, butthe index made up most of the losses later. He spoke on condition ofanonymity.   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's strength followedits uptrend in New York as no other major U.S. banks followed ChaseManhattan Bank's lead in cutting the prime lending rate.   The New York bank cut the rate by 0.5 percent Monday to 10.5percent.   Lower U.S. interest rates decrease the value ofdollar-denominated investments.
