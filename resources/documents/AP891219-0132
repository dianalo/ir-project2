Gorbachev atthe Malta summit that using force to block non-violent independencemovements in the three Baltic Republics would damage U.S.-Sovietrelations, a senior administration source said Tuesday.   ``I think the Soviet leadership understands our position on thisvery clearly,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Meanwhile, an emigre Baltic diplomat who was briefed by U.S.officials on the discussion said he was told that Gorbachevresponded that violence would not be used under his reform.However, Gorbachev made no specific promises on the Baltics, whoseindependence he has opposed, the diplomat said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III received similarassurances from his Soviet counterpart in September. Theconversation at Malta was significant because the independencemovements are gaining strength.   The United States never recognized the Soviet annexation ofLithuania, Latvia and Estonia after World War II.   Under Gorbachev's reforms, those three republics, with acombined population of 7 million, have been striving forindependence. Gorbachev has said that post-war Soviet borderscannot be changed.   Bush's conversation with Gorbachev was not disclosed in the daysimmediately after the Dec. 2-3 summit, but representatives of thethree emigre Baltic governments were briefed Monday by AssistantSecretary of State Raymond Seitz.   By warning Gorbachev against the use of force, Bush assisted theBaltic independence movements, said Stasys Lozoraitis, charged'affaires at the Washington legation of the Lithuania. The exilegovernments of the three republics have maintained legations inWashington since they lost their independence.   ``If they do not use violence, we can slowly and carefully dowhat we need to do,'' Lozoraitis said.   Leaders of the Lithuanian popular front Sajudis are predicting avictory in February elections to the republican parliament and planto use their majority to secede from the Soviet Union, a step thatis legal under the Soviet constitution.   The administration source said that Bush and ``the secretary ofstate have made clear our legal position, that we do not recognizethe incorporation, and that their status ought to be a matter ofself-determination. We have no particular view as to the outcome.'''   A key point of the U.S. position, said the source, was that theprocess ``should be peaceful.'' The exchange on the issue at Malta,the source said ``wasn't really a dialogue. It was a presenting ofviews.''</TEXT></DOC>
