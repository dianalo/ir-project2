Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African who headsNamibia territorial force, said 42 guerrillas were killed inclashes Thursday afternoon, including one battle involving scoresof insurgents. An undetermined number of policemen were injured, hesaid.   Government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said a ``pitchedbattle ... raged for several hours'' Thursday between securityforces and about 200 guerrillas.   Du Rand said at least 252 guerrillas of the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization and 24 members of the South African-ledsecurity forces have been killed since gunbattles broke outSaturday, when a cease-fire was supposed to take effect.   Angola's state news agency quoted SWAPO defense spokesman PeterMuehihange as saying only 38 guerrillas died in that time and nineare missing. He said 20 security force members were killed.   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said his governmentis committed to the plan to grant independence to Namibia, whichPretoria has ruled for 74 years.   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,500 guerrillasinto Namibia in violation of an accord requiring the insurgents toremain at their bases in Angola, at least 100 miles away.   The South African Council of Churches, led by prominentanti-apartheid clergymen, said ``the carnage of the last few days''could have been prevented if the United Nations had denied SouthAfrica's request to let its forces leave their bases to combat theguerrillas.   It said the credibility of the U.N. peacekeeping force was indoubt.   A joint South African-Cuban-Angolan commission monitoring theindependence accord scheduled a meeting Saturday to discuss thecrisis. South Africa's President P.W. Botha said U.S. and Sovietobservers would participate.   ``I trust that the commission will be able to find a peacefulsolution to the very serious situation which has arisen,'' he toldParliament in Cape Town.   Chester A. Crocker, the assistant secretary of state for AfricanAffairs, left Washington on Thursday to attend the commissionmeeting.   A Namibian police official, Chief Inspector Derek Brune,reported more skirmishes Thursday across the 300-mile front nearthe Angolan border. He said the guerrillas have broken up intosmall groups and that some fighters were reported as far as 120miles south of the border.   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent,said the United Nations hoped to have its first infantry battalionsin the battle areas early next week.   The United Nations has authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibiaoperation, but only 921 have arrived. The only forces in the battlearea are about 300 logistical personnel.   The United Nations accepted a U.S. offer to fly 850 Finnishsoldiers to Namibia. Francois Giuliani, spokesman forSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, told reporters the mencould be arriving over the weekend.   SWAPO officials said the guerrilla fighters had been insideNamibia for some time and had no intention of leaving or acceptinga surrender proposal.   But Thornberry said: ``It was made clear beyond a shadow of adoubt to SWAPO that it would have to negotiate an additionalelement'' to the U.N. plan if it wanted bases inside Namibia.   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling forwithdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist Angolabattle U.S.-backed rebels.   Besides granting Namibia independence, South Africa is to endmilitary aid to the Angolan rebels.   SWAPO, which has been waging a war for independence for 23years, is favored to win elections scheduled in November under theU.N. plan.</TEXT></DOC>
