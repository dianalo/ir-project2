The peace symbol is prohibited in at least six Pasadena schools,and a districtwide ban may be established in the fall, he said.   A few miles away, Baytown schools also ban the symbol.   Pasadena officials said the recent drug- and cult-relatedslayings of 15 people in Matamoros, Mexico, reinforced their doubtsabout the symbol.   ``The dramatic conclusion of that tragedy made us sit up and takenotice, but the awareness was already there,'' Lewis said. ``We'dpick up little signs, like students doodling things on desk topswhile not listening in class or rumors of some students involved incult practices.''   Student Andrew Yuhr, 12, said his T-shirt with the symbol ``justmeant peace.''   ``If they ban peace symbols, they'll have to ban basic geometrybecause of all its lines and circles,'' he said.   The peace symbol _ a circle with an inverted ``Y'' with anextended bar _ is believed to date from the late 1950s, created bynuclear disarmament advocates from the semaphore codes for ``N'' and``D.''   Lyle J. Rapecki, an occult expert in Flagstaff, Ariz., and authorof a book on satanic symbols, said that to some groups, the peacesymbol represents Nero's Cross, which he described as an upside-downcross with broken arms.   Debora Johnson said she was shocked when her 11-year-old told herabout the peace-symbol ban at school.   ``A lot of my hippie friends wore peace symbols. When my son toldme some people are saying it has an evil meaning, I said, `That'snot what that means.' I was shocked,'' she said. ``From peace symbolto devil sign _ there's a big gap there.''</TEXT></DOC>
