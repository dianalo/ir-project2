The RTC's plan to settle with Mr. Milken regardless of theFDIC's reservations makes it far more likely that thesettlement will be approved by U.S. District Judge MiltonPollack. RTC Chairman Albert R. Casey is expected to announcethe agency's position at a hearing this afternoon.</LP><TEXT>   The hearing, originally scheduled for last Friday, waspostponed after the FDIC unexpectedly balked at the terms ofthe deal. In a letter to Judge Pollack, a representative ofthe FDIC board of directors said that the agreement didn'trequire Mr. Milken and other top Drexel bankers to discloseenough information about their personal assets. Thesettlement has also been attacked by members of Congress whofeel that Mr. Milken will be left too wealthy under the termsof the deal.   The FDIC and RTC sued Mr. Milken and other former Drexelemployees last year for allegedly helping to cause thefailure of more than 200 savings and loans by manipulatingthe junk bond market. Mr. Milken has denied the allegations.   The proposed settlement calls for Mr. Milken to contribute$900 million, his former colleagues $300 million, andDrexel's insurance companies $100 million. The deal wouldsettle about 170 suits filed by thrift regulators, allegedlydefrauded investors and Drexel against Mr. Milken and others.It would leave Mr. Milken in control of as much as $500million, $125 million of which is in his name and the rest inhis family's.   The RTC's support could be enough to push the deal throughbecause roughly 90% of the claims at issue in the litigationinvolve failed institutions now overseen by the RTC,according to individuals involved in the negotiations. TheRTC, which was under FDIC control until last year, isresponsible for selling the assets of insolvent thrifts.   Supporters of the deal would like to get it approvedbefore additional objections mount. Already lawyers for morethan 20 former Drexel employees have objected to the deal,arguing that Mr. Milken had too much control over its terms.Mr. Milken is serving a ten-year prison sentence for sixcounts of securities-related fraud.   As of yesterday afternoon, negotiations over thedisclosure of the defendants' assets were continuing with theFDIC. But apparently the RTC has resolved those issues to itssatisfaction. The RTC is said to have agreed to anarrangement by which it would examine Mr. Milken's assetsafter it signed off on the deal. If the estimates of Mr.Milken's wealth exceed what is publicly known, the RTC wouldwalk away from the settlement.   Individuals familiar with the negotiations said that ifthe deal is approved without the FDIC's participation, theRTC would simply keep a portion of the government's $500million share of the settlement in an escrow account untilthe FDIC's claims are resolved.   Mr. Casey, a former head of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,is said to have early on supported the settlement because itwould require Mr. Milken to quickly pay what is believed tobe the largest settlement ever negotiated with an individual.People involved in the negotiations said that Mr. Casey wantsto avoid the delay, cost and uncertainty of a trial.   Both the FDIC and the RTC have been represented in thelitigation by the highpowered New York law firm Cravath,Swaine andamp; Moore, which stands to make $40 million on thesettlement. During the course of the negotiations, accordingto individuals involved, the Cravath lawyers gave theimpression that the FDIC would back the $1.3 billionsettlement.   But Cravath partner David Boies said he made it clearduring the negotiations that the disclosure issue mightderail the deal. &quot;I told defense lawyers in words of onesyllable, not once or twice, but several times, that theissue of disclosure was very important to the FDIC,&quot; he said.   The split between the two agencies could put Cravath inthe awkward position of representing clients with conflictinginterests. But so far, the FDIC has not formally objected tothe RTC's position. Spokesmen at the RTC and FDIC could notbe reached for comment.   Lawyers for the defendants fear that the FDIC's demand formore information about the Milken family assets is simply aploy to pressure them for more money. &quot;The FDIC risksunbuttoning the whole thing,&quot; said Michael O. Finkelstein, alawyer representing Michael Milken's brother, Lowell. He saidthat they wouldn't agree to a larger settlement pot. &quot;Wealready negotiated our deal,&quot; Mr. Finkelstein said.</TEXT></DOC>
