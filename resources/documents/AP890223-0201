Critics of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's RioGrande policy said refugees would just be driven to other bordercrossing points or go underground.   Only 10 applicants were processed Thursday, compared to some 50Wednesday and 233 Tuesday, the day the tougher rules went intoeffect.   Of all those applicants, only two had been granted asylum byThursday and the rest were put in barracks at the INS Port IsabelService Processing Center here, 15 miles from Brownsville, or in aRed Cross Shelter in Brownsville.   They were held on bail $1,000 to $4,000 while they await hearingsbefore an INS administrative judge.   The government announced Thursday it is giving $3 million to theRed Cross to operate the Brownsville shelter.   Hundreds of INS officials have been sent to the Rio Grande Valleyto process cases the day they are submitted and weed outapplications the agency says are made by Central Americans coming tothe United States for economic, not political reasons.   Under INS policy that took effect Tuesday, immigrants applyingfor asylum in south Texas must remain in the area until their casesare processed, and those found to have submitted false or frivolousclaims are jailed.   Previously, most immigrants remained free while they awaitedprocessing, appeals or deportation.   Among the 625 immigrants held at Bayview was Juan BautistaSanchez-Sanchez, 28, who said he fled Nicaragua after he wasarrested and beaten because of his participation in marches againstthe leftist Sandinista government.   Sanchez-Sanchez said his application was denied because INSadjudicators did not believe his claims that the government ofPresident Daniel Ortega would jail him or kill him if he returned.   ``They want us to get papers signed by Daniel that they beat usup,'' Sanchez-Sanchez said. ``If they send me back to Nicaragua,they'll probably put me in jail for 30 years on treason charges.''   The two granted asylum the first day were a 32-year-old formerconstruction worker from Managua, who plans to settle in Miami, anda 65-year-old Nicaraguan businessman and accountant living inBrownsville, according to the INS.   ``It was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria,and if they were forced to return to their country they faced awell-founded fear of persecution,'' INS spokesman Virginia Kice said.   INS officials and attorneys representing Central Americansseeking asylum said the dwindling number of applicants may mean thatthey are going underground and taking their chances getting to theirdestination in the United States.   ``Nobody is coming to apply for asylum and that's sort ofpredictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jailhere, so obviously people are going underground and they are notgoing to be going through the system anymore, which is a tragedy,''said Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based ProyectoLibertad, which represents Central Americans.   ``We really don't believe this repressive policy here in the RioGrande Valley is going to do anything to stop refugees from comingto the United States.''   INS officials hope that the word will spread to Central Americathat refugees will face a tougher battle getting into the UnitedStates.   Ms. Kice said the number of Central Americans entering the UnitedStates through Brownsville would decrease or shift to another area.   Since last spring, more than 100,000 Central Americans have usedthe Rio Grande Valley as their gateway to the United States.   Sanchez-Sanchez said more Central Americans would continue totravel to the United States even if it meant they would be jailed.``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but forpolitical reasons and I think they will come if I tell them thateven if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
