MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was a simple, stinging campaign ad _ a pairof hands tearing up a Social Security card.   That was 24 years ago, and Barry Goldwater still recalls it withanger, saying in his memoirs that it was ``a repellent lie'' forthe Democrats to charge he would have destroyed Social Security ifhe had been elected president in 1964.   There's a somewhat milder reprise of that television ad in thiscampaign, as Democrat Michael Dukakis tries to cast Vice PresidentGeorge Bush in the Goldwater role.   It shows a Social Security card with pieces disappearing whileRepublican Bush is accused of favoring benefit cuts. ``Vote for theman you know will protect Social Security and make sure it's therewhen you need it,'' the Dukakis campaign commercial urges.   The issue is back, with the volume relatively low so far butwith the Democrats likely to turn it up in the waning days of thecampaign. A push on Social Security hardly would qualify as anOctober surprise. It has become an October habit.   Dukakis raised the Social Security flag in his first debate withBush on Sept. 25, asserting that ``if he's serious about what he'ssaying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is toraid the Social Security trust fund and he tried that in 1985 and Ithink he's going to try it again.''   The topic may come up again tonight as Bush and Dukakis meet intheir second and final campaign debate.   Both presidential nominees have declared Social Security offlimits in budget-cutting efforts. Bush specifically exempts it fromhis proposed ``flexible freeze'' budget plan.   But that fits the tested Democratic theme, which is to arguethat Republicans always say they are solidly behind Social Securitybefore the election, and renege afterward.   Democratic Sen. Lloyd Benten spelled that out in the vicepresidential debate. ``I know too well what their track record is... and we should be concerned about that kind of an effort onceagain after the election is over.''   Bentsen accused Sen. Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, of votingeight times to cut Social Security benefits. Quayle replied thatwhat he'd voted for, and what Bentsen himself had twice voted for,was to delay cost-of-living increases.   Bush voted in 1985 to break a Senate tie and impose a one-yearfreeze on increases in Social Security benefits. In the end,nothing was frozen.   Dukakis supported a 1985 National Governors' Association policystatement that included a freeze in Social Security cost-of-livingincreases. The Dukakis campaign says the Massachusetts governorfirst voted for an amendment that would have exempted SocialSecurity, but his side lost. None of it was binding anyhow.   So there is enough history, and enough ambiguity on both sidesto push most other topics off the campaign agenda. Not this one.   Bush is trying to anticipate, and undercut, the long-testedDemocratic issue by calling it more of the same. ``Here again, myopponent is using what can only be described as irresponsible scaretactics _ the same shopworn ones his party trots out every timethey fall behind, usually about three weeks before an election,''he said in Seattle on Monday.   It may look shopworn, but is also is shop-proven. After theRepublicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Sen. Bob Dole ofKansas blamed the loss of the majority he had led on the Democrats'chorused campaign on the Social Security issue.   The Republican administration had sought to slow cost-of-livingincreases, and had recommended reductions in ancillary benefits,rearming Democrats on the issue. It has been a troublesome topicfor President Reagan since he came to national politics _ aftercalling Social Security the flagship of the liberal cause andsiding with 1964 Goldwater suggestions that it be made voluntary.   Writing about his own campaign in his new book, ``Goldwater,''the former Arizona senator said the point he tried to make was thatSocial Security was not actuarily sound, a point Reagan repeatedduring his 1976 and 1980 Republican campaign. That argument wasbetter mathematically than politically.   Goldwater also warned that Social Security taxes wouldinevitably escalate and would one day rival the burden of federalincome taxes for many Americans. That seemed improbable in 1964,but not now.   President Ford took on the issue in 1975, proposing ceilingsthat would have curbed Social Security cost-of-living increases byalmost half, and telling Congress that it would have to restrainthat and other transfer payments, programs in which the governmentmakes payments to individuals. He got nowhere.   A month ago, Robert Strauss, co-chairman of a bipartisancommission that will offer economic advice to the incomingpresident, said that if deficits really are to be eliminated ``wehave to go to Social Security, Medicare and entitlementsgenerally,'' along with defense spending curbs. Strauss is aveteran Democratic campaigner and fund-raiser, and a former partychairman.   He later said that wasn't a commission idea but, rather, his ownview of the cold, hard truth.   The hard political truth is that neither candidate is going topermit, let alone propose, any talk of significant curbs or changesin Social Security. It's a given.   Quayle made that point after accusing debate rival Bentsen oftrying to scare the elderly on the issue.   ``This program is not a Republican program, it's not aDemocratic program,'' Quayle said. ``It's a program for olderAmericans that program is actuarily sound to the turn of thiscentury.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
