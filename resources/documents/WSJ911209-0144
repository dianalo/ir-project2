The employment report came as a shock to White Houseofficials, as well as many private economists, who haveargued for months that the economy began a modest upturn lastspring. Their arguments rested largely on figures showingthat payroll employment began creeping upward in April. ButFriday's figures, which registered a drop of 241,000 inpayroll workers during November, reversed most of thoseearlier gains and depicted an economy flat on its back.</LP><TEXT>   Within the Bush administration, officials privately calledthe numbers &quot;very troubling.&quot; The administration is nowscrambling to assemble an economic recovery plan that it willunveil in the president's State of the Union address in lateJanuary. And members of Congress at a hearing of the HouseWays and Means committee on Friday were adamant about theneed for action. &quot;Above all,&quot; said GOP Rep. Mickey Edwards ofOklahoma, &quot;let's just not sit here and do nothing.&quot;   But what can the government do?   A quarter century ago, that question seemed an easy one.Economists were in the ascendancy. Time magazine ran a coverphoto of British economist John Maynard Keynes in 1965 anddeclared that his followers &quot;had descended in force fromtheir ivory towers and now sit confidently at the elbow ofalmost every important leader in government and business.&quot;Robert Lekachman wrote that, thanks to Mr. Keynes's ideas,&quot;the sad cycle of boom and bust has been tamed.&quot;   Today, that easy confidence has evaporated. The nation haslearned that the tools for combating recessions are far lesspotent than once thought. And their potency is especiallylimited at the present, with fiscal policy hobbled by a $350billion federal budget deficit and monetary policy crippledby a banking system under siege   There's also a timing problem. The recession began 17months ago, and any effective measures to counter it shouldhave begun shortly thereafter. As it is, the president's planwon't be unveiled until late January, and under even the bestof circumstances legislation won't be enacted until lateMarch or April. That means any boost to the economy will bedelayed until the second half of next year -- more than twoyears after the recession began and possibly months after itends.   Nevertheless, the new numbers raise the risk that thisdownturn could last far longer than past recessions. And thepolitical pressures for action in an election year havebecome too strong to ignore.   As a result, an economic rescue package now seems all butcertain. The challenge for the government is to fashionproposals that will offer some hope of helping the economy inthe near-term, without harming it over the longer run.   That won't be easy. Any measures that make large permanentadditions to the nation's huge budget deficit, for instance,could stimulate the economy over the next 12 to 24 months buthobble it well into the next century. Economists across thepolitical spectrum agree the U.S. economy has suffered fordecades from insufficient investment. The big budget deficitsthat soak up the nation's scarce savings -- which provide thefunds for such investment -- are only likely to make thatproblem worse.   Here's a look at some of the options the government has,and arguments both for and against them.                                                                                                          Middle Class Tax Cuts                                                                                                          This is the clear favorite of the politicians, but winslittle praise from the experts. If a tax cut for the middleclass is permanent, it could indeed stimulate consumerspending and boost the economy. But because the middle classis so big, the cost to the government of any substantialmiddle-class tax relief will be immense, swelling an alreadyswollen deficit.   To cut the cost, administration and congressionaltax-writers may make any middle-class tax cut they adopttemporary. But economic research suggests that when peopleknow a tax cut is temporary, they will save most of it ratherthan spend it -- thus providing little short-term kick to theeconomy. &quot;It's well-known by macro economists that temporarytax cuts don't provide much stimulus,&quot; says Joel Slemrod,professor of economics at the University of Michigan.   Another proposal that's popular among Democrats would givea permanent tax cut for the middle-class while paying for itby raising taxes on high-income Americans. There may be anargument for this on social equity grounds, but it would dolittle to stimulate the economy, since it simply shiftsincome from one group to another. In the short run, the planmight give a very slight boost to consumer spending, sincemiddle-class people tend to spend a greater share of theirincome than the rich. But in the long-run it would decreasesavings, since the wealthy save more.   Nevertheless, with an election year approaching, politicsis a more powerful motivating force than economic logic. Asubstantial part of the administration's rescue plan -- andan even larger part of the plan finally enacted by Congress-- is likely to be devoted to middle-class tax relief.                                                                                                          Investment Tax Credit                                                                                                          The investment tax credit, which has been in and out ofthe tax code three times in the last three decades, is nowvying for another run. And it may well get it.   Economic evidence suggests the credit -- a tax break forcompanies that invest in new equipment -- has in the pastprovided a short-term boost to investment spending. Andunlike middle-class tax cuts, this tax break is even morepotent if it's temporary. If companies know the credit isgoing to expire after two years, they are likely to speed upinvestment spending they had planned for the future -- givinga boost to the economy.   The credit has its drawbacks. It only encourages certaintypes of traditional equipment investments, and does little,for instance, to boost investment in research or newtechnologies. Moreover, it is expensive. The one eliminatedin 1986 cost the government more than $25 billion a year inlost tax revenue. But the cost can be trimmed substantiallyif the credit is allowed only for certain types of equipment(the old credit applied to purchases of cars and officepartitions, as well as machine tools), and if it is made&quot;incremental&quot; -- that is, if a company only gets the creditfor investments that exceed a certain threshold.   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold Poling said last week thathe thought an investment tax credit would do more to boostcar sales than a middle-class tax cut. The reason? &quot;Aninvestment tax credit would encourage more investment,thereby creating more jobs,&quot; he said. The idea, initially asleeper, is picking up some support in Congress and the WhiteHouse.                                                                                                          Capital Gains Tax Cut                                                                                                          The virtue of a capital gains tax cut is that it providesan investment incentive at little -- if any -- cost to thegovernment. Indeed, administration calculations suggest thetax cut actually raises money in the first few years it's ineffect.   That's because in the U.S., the capital gains tax -- whichis the tax on the increase in the value of an investment --is essentially voluntary. Wealthy people can choose, if theywish, to hold their assets until they die, and thereby passthem along to heirs without paying any tax on the gain. Thewealthy are less likely to sell those assets and pay the taxif the tax rate is high. Thus, a lower tax rate can result inmore sales and perhaps more tax revenue for the government.   The administration says the measure would help the economyin the short run by boosting the value of assets that qualifyfor the tax break, such as real estate. But most economistssay that any short-term boost would be very small. And whilethe tax cut could increase investment in the long run,experts worry the cut could bring back tax shelters and otherforms of activity designed more to elude taxes than createproductive investment.   The main argument against the tax cut, however, is anegalitarian one. The greatest benefit from a cut in capitalgains taxes goes to the wealthy. The administration iscertain to repropose this cut, but it will face oppositionfrom Democrats, who call it a giveaway to the rich.                                                                                                          Increased Spending                                                                                                          The government could choose simply to increase its ownspending, thus stimulating the economy. President Bush hasalready called for a modest speed-up in certain types offederal spending.   Critics say, however, that government bureaucracies tendto be a slow and inefficient means of channeling increasedspending to the economy. &quot;You are looking at a lag of a year,maybe two years.&quot; says Van Ooms, former chief economist forthe House Budget Committee. Moreover, in Washington,&quot;temporary&quot; spending increases -- as well as &quot;temporary&quot; taxcuts -- have a way of becoming permanent, and thus increasingthe budget deficit.   Some Democrats have proposed paying for increased spendingby cutting defense. &quot;I believe that we should change thebudget agreement to permit defense cuts to fund domesticspending in areas such as education, training and publicworks,&quot; House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said onFriday. But such measures will only stimulate the economy ifthe increased spending occurs now, and the defense cuts aredelayed for several years. Otherwise, the overall economiceffect would likely be neutral.   Currently, however, both Congress and the White House arefocusing most of their attention on tax cuts, rather thanspending increases.                                                                                                          Lower Interest Rates                                                                                                          The Federal Reserve has been gradually cutting short-terminterest rates since the economy turned down, providing thegovernment's only real attack against the recession. The Fedcut its key federal funds interest rate another quarter pointon Friday, to 4.5%.   But many critics still say the Fed has moved too slowly,and could do more to spur the economy. To be sure, the Fedhas cut short-term interest rates more than 3.5 percentagepoints since the recession began. And many Fed officialsworry that further cuts now could fuel inflation once theeconomy recovers.   But at the moment, the threat from inflation seems small.And in percentage terms, the Fed's rate cuts have been modestcompared to cuts it made in previous recessions. &quot;To begenerally consistent with historical norms,&quot; writes RobertGiordano, economist at Goldman Sachs, the fed funds ratewould have to fall &quot;into the 3.5% to 4% range.&quot;   &quot;The principal short-run action to get the economy movinghas to be monetary policy,&quot; agrees economist Paul McCracken,who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisersunder President Nixon.                                                                                                          Bank Capital                                                                                                          Some analysts complain the Fed's efforts to boost theeconomy are failing because of the banking crisis. A lowerfed funds rate -- which is the interest rate banks charge onloans to each other -- reduces the amount banks must pay formoney. But it doesn't necessarily make a bank that'sstruggling to increase capital and to improve its balancesheet any more willing to lend.   To address this problem, New York Governor Mario Cuomo --who is considering running for president -- has proposed thatthe Federal Reserve invest $20 billion to $25 billion ofequity in major banks, in return for a commitment from thosebanks that they will make new loans to small and medium-sizedbusinesses.   The idea gets a chilly reception at the Federal Reserve,and among most banking experts. First, assuming the Fed makesno changes in monetary policy, the $25 billion would comestraight out of the taxpayer's pocket. Second, bankingexperts say, the idea is bad banking policy. &quot;It's a clearconflict of interest,&quot; says Robert Litan of the BrookingsInstitution, &quot;to have the Fed supervising banks it doesn'town at the same time it is owning banks&quot; through an equityinterest.                                                                                                          Individual Retirement Accounts                                                                                                          The various proposals to expand tax breaks for savingsaccounts demonstrate the confusion over short- and long-rungoals. Savings may be desirable in the long-run; but if theseproposals succeeded in making people save more in thenear-term, they would only cut consumer spending and deepenthe recession.   On the other hand, various ideas have been proposed thatwould allow people to borrow from existing IRAs and otherpension programs to finance purchases of new homes. Thatcould help the economy in the near-term by boosting homesales; but it could also decrease the savings available forother, more productive investments in the long-run.   In the end, of course, any rescue package should begreeted with only modest expectations. Many of the problemsthe U.S. economy faces -- overbuilt commercial real estatemarkets, overextended banks, debt-burdened consumers -- areones that must be worked out over time. &quot;One of the worstthings the government can do right now,&quot; says Robert Hormats,vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, &quot;is to implythere is a way to `jump-start' this economy. There's too muchheavy baggage in the economy, and if you imply you can jumpstart it, you will just breed more cynicism.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
