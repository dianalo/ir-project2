As autumn nears, futures prices normally trade at a widepremium to the index of freight rates, says Matthew Frank, atrader at GNI Freight Futures Ltd. This year, however,futures contracts over the next nine months are level withthe spot index of 1208 points, he says, while the contractfor next July is at a discount of 10%.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The futures market reflects the consensus of the shippingtrade,&quot; an executive of an Oslo shipping company says.&quot;Demand for cargoes is waning, while the supply of ships isrising at a rapid rate. As a result, the market expectsfreight rates to decline.&quot;   London's Baltic International Freight Futures Exchangeaccounts for only a tiny proportion of the shipping market,dealers say, but it is used by the trade as a guide to thefuture. The market trades contracts based on an index ofimportant dry cargo shipping rates covering 14 shippingroutes. Grain accounts for about 60% of the index'sweighting, followed by iron ore and steel at 18%. Theremainder of the index is allocated to coal and phosphates.   Gloomy forecasts by futures traders and shipping brokerscontrast with the smart 12% rally in the index of freightrates since the beginning of July. The market becamedepressed when expected grain orders from the Soviet Unionand China failed to materialize, Mr. Frank of GNI says.   Having begun to appreciate from their July lows, freightfutures prices jumped when Iraq invaded Kuwait, he says.Shipowners raised freight rates to compensate for the surgein bunker fuel prices, Mr. Frank says, and internationalgrain traders, taking advantage of low corn, wheat and barleyprices, bought cargoes for shipment.   Yet it is highly unlikely that shipowners will maintainfreight rates, ship brokers say.   Despite the rally in the past two months, the BalticFreight index is down 31% from its all time high of 1750points in May 1989. The decline almost matches freight ratesof a ship carrying 55,000 metric tons of grain from the Gulfof Mexico to Ports of Antwerp, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, whichhave fallen to $11 a metric ton from $15 a ton last year.Meanwhile, ships ranging from 25,000 metric tons to more than100,000 tons lowered their charges this year, says PeterKerr-Dineen, a director of Howe Robinson Shipbrokers.   The freight index was buoyant in 1988 and 1989 because ofhuge Soviet orders for grain, a growing world economy andfewer new ships, Mr. Kerr-Dineen says.   In the coming 12 months, however, the Soviet Union, Chinaand India are unlikely to import vast quantities of grain, hesays. And a slowdown in production of steel and other bulkcommodities will help reduce the flow of cargoes across theoceans, he says.   While demand is falling, supply has increased. The revivalin trade between 1987 to 1989 encouraged shipowners to buildmore ships, and fewer of the older vessels are beingscrapped, brokers say.   As a result, ships equivalent to 67 millions tonsdeadweight were on order by the first quarter this year,compared with 33 million tons deadweight at the end of 1987,says Robert Garner, a joint managing director of EggarForrester Ltd., London ship brokers.   At the end of June there were orders for 398 ships,including oil, bulk cargo and combination carriers, he says.This quantity was much larger than in previous years.   The crisis in the Persian Gulf will aggravate thesituation, Mr. Garner says. The Iraqi trade blockade andmines in the Persian Gulf will force large &quot;combinationships,&quot; which can transport either oil or dry cargoes, tocompete for grain, iron ore or coal business, he says. As aresult other shipowners will lower freight rates, Mr. Garnerpredicts.   &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; says Philip Rogers, head of research atSimpson, Spence andamp; Young, London ship brokers, &quot;I don'tforesee a collapse of the freight market. But shipping tradeis likely to be flat next year.&quot;   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Gold                                                                                                          Gold turned quiet around midweek as tensions cooled a bitin the Persian Gulf, and eased Friday -- a trend analysts saymay continue.   One analyst says the Mideast crisis remains the majorfactor in gold, but the dollar appears to be having a renewedinfluence.   &quot;Historically, the dollar has had a greater impact on goldwhen it is strong than when it weakens,&quot; the analyst says,&quot;so the easiness of gold may be forecasting a strongerdollar.&quot;   Significantly, he says, the lower trend in gold is takingplace when prices for crude oil and products are strong andgenerating an inflationary climate.   A negative for precious metals in general, he says, isthat there is very little investor demand for gold, even lessfor platinum and practically none for silver.   Another analyst, Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader forChase Manhattan Bank, says the market at the moment was&quot;anticipating peace&quot; but that overall it &quot;remainsevent-driven.&quot;   Craig Sloane, precious metals analyst for Smith Barney,says the market at the weekend was &quot;sort of haphazard andgiving no real signs of what is in store&quot; this week.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          This week traders will watch for any sign that wheatprices can find strength after the value of some contractsdropped about 8% last week.   Wheat prices are sinking amid forecasts that largeharvests in the Soviet Union might trim its demand for U.S.crops. At the same time, other countries, such as India, aredealing with good-sized crops. According to traders, Indiamight export one million metric tons of wheat. It usuallyisn't such a large supplier.   &quot;The world is awash in wheat,&quot; says Victor Lespinasse,assistant vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.   Traders will also continue to watch the military crisis inthe Persian Gulf. If oil prices climb sharply this week,grain prices would tend to follow suit on speculation thatsome oil-producing nations might use their higher revenues tobuy more U.S. grain.                                                                                                          Sugar                                                                                                          Futures prices plunged a half cent a pound Friday on areported world market sale of sugar by Brazil. Tradersdeparted for the long holiday weekend wondering if furthersales were in store this week.   According to one analyst, Brazil was reported to have soldas much as 170,000 tons of refined sugar to internationaltrade houses. &quot;It caught the market by surprise because noone expected export sales so soon in the new season thatbegan June 1,&quot; the analyst says.   The sales raise questions as to how much more sugar Brazilmay have for sale, the analyst says. Due to high oil prices,Brazil had been expected to divert more cane to alcohol andwithhold sugar stocks in case they were needed for internalconsumption, either as alcohol or sugar, she says.</TEXT></DOC>
