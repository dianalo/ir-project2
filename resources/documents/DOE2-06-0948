Theamount of primary energy to be spent for the production of the fuelsfrom biomass initially, is less than the amount of energy from fossilfuels which these products can substitute. However, only a small partof the total primary energy required in the FRG will be covered by biomass-derivedfuels which will be competitive in exceptional cases only, bearing inmind today's economic conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
