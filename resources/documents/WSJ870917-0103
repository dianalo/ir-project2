It is the seventh insurance carrier this year to file for withdrawal in Maine, which insurers say has relatively low premium rates but generous compensation benefits. Compared with other states, Maine ranks among the highest in the nation for lost workday rates.    Workers compensation insurance pays for the cost of medical care, rehabilitation and lost wages for injured employees and death benefits for dependents of people killed in work-related accidents.    In filing its request, Travelers noted that it has incurred a loss of almost $10 million from 1984 to 1986 on workmen's compensation insurance in the state. Dan Kaferle, a Travelers spokesman, said that during the three years Travelers paid $31.9 million in benefits and collected $22.1 million in premiums.    &quot;Simply put, the Maine system pays first-class benefits at fourth-class prices,&quot; said Raymond Stahl, Travelers senior vice president. He added that Travelers' action was necessitated by the dim prospects that circumstances will change soon.    The company asks that it be allowed to stop writing new policies beginning next Jan. 1. Travelers, which currently provides coverage for about 5% of Maine's workers compensation market, added that it will continue all current policies to expiration.    Everard Stevens, a spokesman in the state insurance office, said that Travelers' request to withdraw will be reviewed, like those submitted by other insurance companies that have filed similar requests.    Among that group, two have been given permission to discontinue writing workers compensation policies as of Dec. 31, and the others remain under review, Mr. Stevens said.    Insurance companies require state regulatory agency clearance to discontinue their policies in Maine. Mr. Stevens said the provision, similar to those in other states, is to protect claimants from &quot;sudden and unreasonable terminations of policies.&quot;    A request for withdrawal by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., the nation's and Maine's largest carrier of workers' compensation insurance, was rejected in June. But Liberty spokeswoman Jean Fitz said that the company has appealed that decision.    If an insurer's request for withdrawal is finally denied by the state, the company may contest the decision in court. </TEXT></DOC>
