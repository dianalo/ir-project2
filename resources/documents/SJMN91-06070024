But the fact is, lots of Americans look forward to a little foreignspice in their holidays. The big question: Can they find it on this side ofthe Atlantic and the Pacific?;    Glad you asked. We've come up with 10 U.S.,Canadian and Mexican destinations that have a distinctly exotic flavor. Soclose, and yet so far -- that's the idea.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INTERNATIONAL APPEAL WITHOUT CROSSING ANOCEAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Destination: North AmericaScripps Howard News Service contributed to this story.  </MEMO><TEXT>     To qualify for the list, each of the 10 places had to possess broad appealas a vacation site. Each had to be different from almost anywhere else in theUnited States and Canada.;    In addition, if flying worries you, all thesedestinations can be reached by car, except Southeastern Alaska, which isserved by ferry and cruise ships. For a vacation with international flair butno transoceanic flights, consider:;     Quebec City;  The local folks speakFrench, which gives Quebec City a distinctly foreign flavor. The food is verymuch French-influenced, right down to the ubiquitous loaves of French bread.And, happily, it looks like a French city. It was France's first settlement inNorth America.;    It is a walled city, which strongly reinforces theimpression you are in Europe, and the restored 17th- and 18th-century stonebuildings in the old section duplicate the architecture of a French provincialtown. Cobblestone squares, narrow streets, the castle-like Chateau Frontenachotel and a profusion of sidewalk cafes complete the picture.;    Information:Quebec Government Office of Tourism, (800) 443-7000.;     San Antonio; Founded by Spanish missionaries arriving from Mexico, San Antonio retains manyof the features of Spanish colonial architecture -- red-tiled roofs, adobewalls and shady courtyards -- found in 17th- and 18th-century towns south ofthe border. The famed Alamo was a Spanish mission, and four other old missionsin the city are preserved as San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.;   San Antonio's Spanish colonial heritage is authentic, but the city also hascreated a Mexican fantasyland called the Paseo del Rio, a beautiful promenadealong the San Antonio River. Stone stairways, arched bridges, banana trees,outdoor cafes, sidewalk musicians and a profusion of twinkling lights are theromantic setting for a nightly Mexican-flavored fiesta.;    Information: SanAntonio Convention and Visitors Bureau, 317 Alamo St., San Antonio, Texas78205; (800) 447-3372.;     Aspen;  Other Rocky Mountain states can offer theawesome scenery and rugged outdoor challenges that are a big part of theappeal of the Alps. But only Colorado has all of this and Aspen, a chicmountain village that is as fashionable as any Alpine retreat -- in summer aswell as winter.;    Sure, you can visit Aspen on a modest budget, but there'sprobably no other North American resort where you also can splurge asindulgently on luxury hotels, fine cuisine and expensive souvenirs. Inappearance, Aspen is as tastefully attractive in Old West garb as the moreformal grand resorts of the Alps. And the mountain vistas are as spectacular.In summer, the resort plays host to a major festival of classical music.;    Information: Aspen Visitors Center, 620 East Hyman Ave., Aspen, Colo. 81611;(303) 925-5656.;      Minneapolis-St. Paul;  In winter, the Twin Cities canresemble Europe's frozen northland. But similarities are strong in summer,too. Minneapolis is a modern city with avant-garde flair while St. Paul ismore Old World in style. Together, they reflect the old and new of the citiesof Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Both are sparkling clean, and thesidewalks seem filled with tall, lanky, blond people.;    But what reallygives the Twin Cities a Scandinavian look is their river setting amid pineforests and lakes. Though far from the ocean, they are nevertheless watersidecities. Within Minneapolis itself are several large lakes, which residentsmake good use of in the summer for swimming and boating.;     Information:Minnesota Office of Tourism, 375 Jackson St., 250 Farm Credit Services, St.Paul, Minn. 55101; (800) 657-3700.;     Miami and the Keys;  If you can't makeit to the Caribbean, then Miami and the Florida Keys might do nicely instead.Miami's beaches are good, the city's vegetation is lush and -- for better orworse -- the summer climate is as sultry as it is on any Caribbean island.;   The city's large Cuban population has given Miami a Latin flavor, which isreflected in interesting dishes on many menus. Spanish is spoken widely, bothby Cuban residents and hordes of South Americans who flock to the city for thebright lights and good times. Venture down into the Keys, and you findexcellent Caribbean-style resorts such as Hawk's Cay on Duck Key at MileMarker 61.;     Information: Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, 701Brickell Ave., Suite 2700, Miami, Fla. 33131, (305) 539-3000.;     Victoria,B.C.;  Victoria draws tourists by the ferry-loads, in large part because itmanages to live up to most preconceptions of what a proper English town shouldlook like. It is wonderfully quaint, which it manages to achieve by hangingpots of blooming flowers off every imaginable pillar and post.;    Much of thearchitecture is Tudor or Victorian, and the city is filled with the sort ofbroad green parks and well-tended gardens that make London so appealing. Thewaterfront bustles, which adds a proper British seagoing element to theambiance. Dominating the harbor is another castle-like hotel, the monumentalEmpress, which each afternoon serves high tea to those fortunate to find afree table.;     Information: Tourism British Columbia, Parliament Building,Victoria, B.C. V8V 1X4, Canada; (800) 663-6000.;     Los Cabos;  Not much morethan empty beaches and barren desert a few years ago, the Mexican governmentis planning for a resort more controlled than Cancun.;    Visitors will findtwo sides to Los Cabos: San Jose del Cabo, a charming, more-authenticallyMexican town, and Cabo San Lucas with its nightlife.;    This is the ends ofthe Earth, literally. Los Cabos is at the tip of land's end on the1,000-mile-long Baja California peninsula, where the Pacific Ocean meets theSea of Cortez.;    Big plans for resorts and golf courses are on drawingboards with target dates of 2000 or before. If you go now, you'll seesomething more original.;    If you want peace and quiet, there's a lagoon andestuary with more than 200 species of birds next to the Stouffer PresidenteHotel. If you want noise, check out the hottest nightspot in town, the CaboWabo Cantina, owned by the rock group Van Halen.;     Information: MexicanGovernment Tourist Office, 10100 Santa Monica Blvd.,  224, Los Angeles 90067;(213) 203-9335.;     Nova Scotia;  The Scottish were among severalnationalities who settled the rugged, wind-swept peninsula jutting into theAtlantic. For them, the dramatic seascapes, now dotted with fishing villages,and the highlands and forests reminded them of home. As in Scotland, much ofNova Scotia remains remote and wild.;     Information: Nova Scotia Tourism andCulture, 136 Commercial St., Portland, Maine 04101; (800) 341-6096.;    Southeastern Alaska;  In truth, some of our North American substitutes areonly shadows of the real thing. But the Inside Passage to Alaska is fully asspectacular -- if not more so -- than a cruise of Norway's legendary fiords.Along both the Alaskan or Norwegian coast, much of the view is of soaringsnow-capped mountains, rocky ridges and dense forests broken by occasionalvillages.;     Information: Alaska Division of Tourism, P.O. Box E, Juneau,Alaska 99811; (907) 465-2010.;     New Orleans;  New Orleans is a mix of manyinfluences. In the city's famed French Quarter, street names are in Frenchwhile several of the most historic buildings are Spanish in origin. They giveNew Orleans a European look, but the city's steamy summer weather isdefinitely tropical. While touring the French Quarter's narrow, balcony-shadedstreets, picture yourself, perhaps, in a raffish Mediterranean port where thepace is slow and good times are appreciated. If you are looking for fun, NewOrleans welcomes visitors nightly with a friendly open-air party on BourbonStreet.;    -- Information: Greater New Orleans Tourist and ConventionCommission, 1520 Sugar Bowl Drive, Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, La.70112; (504) 566-5068.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JAMES T.
