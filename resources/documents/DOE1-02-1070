The long half-life (14 d)of sup(117m)Sn and its emission of abundant short-range Auger and conversionelectrons, make sup(117m)Sn(4+)DTPA an attractive therapeutic agent forbone tumors. The necessary nuclear data for production of clinical quantitiesof sup(117m)Sn using Sb(p,2pxn) reactions at BLIP was obtained. The excitationfunctions for {sup 121}Sb(p,2p3n) and {sup 123}Sb(p,2p5n) reactions inthe regions of 43 andless;=Esub(p)andless;=60 MeV were measured and compared with predictedvalues obtained from semi-empirical formulae given by Silberberg andTsao. sup(117m)Sn is routinely produced at ORNL by thermal neutron activationof {sup 116}Sn. The possibility has been investigated of improving thespecific activity of the reactor-produced sup(117m)Sn by irradiatingenriched {sup 116}Sn and {sup 117}Sn in the core of the HFBR. The resultsindicate that, due to a strong absorption resonance better specific activityfor reactor-produced sup(117m)Sn can be obtained by irradiating naturaltin in the core of a reactor.</TEXT></DOC>
