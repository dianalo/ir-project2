The decision, by a 5-4 vote, marked the first time thehigh court has imposed a uniform federal time limit onlawsuits under the frequently used Section 10(b) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 of theSecurities and Exchange Commission.</LP><TEXT>   Until yesterday, shareholders' lawsuits under these broadprovisions, which make securities fraud illegal, were subjectto time limits imposed by state laws. Many states giveindividuals six years to file suits after discovering thatthey had been victims of securities fraud. Some states allowas long as 10 years.   The Supreme Court ended these state-by-state disparities,saying in a decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun thatsaid securities fraud cases must be filed within one year ofdiscovering the fraud and no later than three years after thefraud took place.   As this time period is shorter than that allowed by moststates, lawyers who represent shareholders in securitiesfraud cases said the decision will significantly reduce thenumber of class-action suits in big fraud cases, wherewrongdoing is often well-concealed and difficult to discover.   But other securities experts welcomed the decision. JohnCoffee, a Columbia University Law School professor, said itfills a need for a &quot;uniform, coherent and rational&quot; timelimit. He said suits that may be thrown out because theydidn't meet the time limit will include some that misuse thefederal securities laws.   Prof. Coffee said, &quot;If the reasonable plaintiff doesn'tdiscover that he's been deceived in three years, it may bethat he's trying to convert the federal securities laws intoan insurance system which is very costly.&quot;   Theodore Olson, a former Reagan administration officialwho argued the case for the defendants, contends that thedecision will limit the risk of lawsuits for &quot;issuers,underwriters, accountants, officers and directors,&quot;particularly after public offerings. &quot;It becomes a majorbenefit that there will be peace of mind after a few years,&quot;he said.   But the SEC disagreed with the ruling. Although the agencyadvocated a uniform federal time limit, it favored afive-year period for filing securities-fraud actions. ThomasRiesenberg, assistant general counsel of the SEC, called thenew time period too short, saying, it will &quot;cut off theability of some victims of securities fraud to recover theirdamages.&quot;   Some private securities-fraud lawsuits are filed onlyafter the SEC has brought a civil action. The SEC isn'tcovered by the new time limit and often takes more than threeyears to investigate a case secretly before filing publiccharges.   The high court said the one-year and three-year limits arebased on those in other parts of federal securities law.Section 10(b) doesn't include its own time limit because itdoesn't explicitly authorize lawsuits by individuals oversecurities fraud. The federal courts found that such privatelawsuits were implicit in Section 10(b).   The ruling yesterday threw out securities-fraud claimsagainst a New Jersey law firm, Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupisandamp; Petigrow. The claims were filed by individuals who investedin limited partnerships that were organized as a tax shelterin 1979 with advice from the law firm. The federal taxbenefits were later disallowed by the Internal RevenueService, prompting the investors to sue.   The four justices who dissented were John Stevens, SandraO'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter.
