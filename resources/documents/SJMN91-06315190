Maybe we can even talk about it.Maybe we can even practice it safely. The virus that invariably leads to AIDSis not something that happens only to others or just someone unlucky enough tobe in the wrong dentist's chair. If it could happen to Magic Johnson, it couldhappen to us.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MANY MORE IMPLICATIONS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  NBA Report; Some information in this report was obtained from writers in othercities.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The basketball implications are ominous for the Lakers. This is the end oftheir era, the one that began when Johnson joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 12 yearsago and brought an NBA championship to the Forum in his rookie season. Thelights of Showtime have flickered their last.;   What it means for theWarriors, if they can stay healthy, is a very real chance to finally survivethe semifinal playoff round and advance to the Pacific Conference finals. A50-victory season is not out of the question.;   And what it means for the NBAis the loss of its most upbeat voice. The smile is gone for the league. We'reall the sadder for it.; TRADE THAT NEVER WAS: The Warriors had a chance todeal with Sacramento before the June draft. But they wouldn't have ended upwith Billy Owens on the team. They would have taken Dikembe Mutombo.;   Coachand General Manager Don Nelson acknowledges he wanted Mutombo more than anyoneelse in the draft. And all he had to do to get him was send Mitch Richmond andthe top two of his first-round draft choices to the Kings for the No. 3 slot.Mutombo was taken by Denver, the team choosing fourth. There still was achance that Charlotte, picking first, would have gone for Mutombo, but theHornets went with Nevada-Las Vegas forward Larry Johnson.;   &quot;That was toohigh a price,&quot; Nelson said about the 3-for-1 Sacramento proposal. &quot; . . . Theway it's worked out is much better.&quot;;   This leads to the question of whetherthe Warriors would be a better team without Richmond, bulky rookie backupcenter Victor Alexander and unused forward Chris Gatling -- or without Owens-- but with Mutombo starting in the middle. We'll never know.; TELLIS IS BACK:Look who popped up in Minnesota. None other than Tellis Frank, the Warriors'failed No. 1 draft choice of 1987. He was traded to Miami in 1989 for a No. 2draft pick, then released after one season with the Heat.;   Frank played aseason in Italy, which wasn't to his taste.;   &quot;You can't go out in the middleof the night and get a Slurpee,&quot; Frank said.;   Another almost unnoticedtransaction was the release of Russell Cross, the Warriors' No. 1 of 1983 andthe sixth player taken in the draft, by the Continental BasketballAssociation's La Crosse Catbirds. Cross, who lasted only a season with theWarriors, is 30 years old.;   A better story is Kevin Pritchard, the Warriors'No. 2 pick last year. He was traded to San Antonio for a 1993 No. 2, thenreleased by the Spurs. Injuries to Boston guards Dee Brown and Brian Shaw havegiven Pritchard a job with the Celtics.; SHORT SHOTS: Remember those 375,000pocket schedules the Warriors handed out with the Dec. 21 game against Seattlein the wrong place? One other problem: Richmond is on the cover. . . . Seattlecenter Benoit Benjamin has dropped boxing promoter Don King as his co-agentbut says it isn't because of recent suggestions King was associated with mobguys. . . . Phoenix's Tom Chambers is in danger of losing his starting forwardjob to Jerrod Mustaf. . . . Pat Riley wants Xavier McDaniel to take 20 shots agame for the Knicks. The X-man says he wants to shoot better before doingthat, adding, &quot;You can't shoot 39 percent and expect the ball. I wouldn't passthe ball to me.&quot; . . . What's wrong with Portland? The league's bestrebounding club was losing the battle of the boards by a margin of eightthrough the first four games. . . . Karl Malone's unusual triple crown of lastseason, courtesy of Harvey Pollack's Philly media guide: 23 technicals (morethan any other player), plus league highs of 65 offensive fouls and 18three-second lane violations. . . . Cleveland guard Mark Price is doing sowell in his rehabilitation from knee surgery that he probably won't have towear a brace when he returns within the next two months. . . . Someone figuredout that expansion Miami was over .500 for only seven of the franchise's first1,660 days.; TALKING TRASH: Tim Hardaway said after Tuesday's game that he andMichael Jordan were just talking about the Chicago weather.;   Actually,Jordan told Hardaway, &quot;This is my town,&quot; when the Bulls were in front in thethird quarter. But when the Warriors went ahead for good in the fourthquarter, the cocky Hardaway yelled at Jordan, &quot;This ain't your town anymore!&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Bergman  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  875  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 10, 199100315190,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
