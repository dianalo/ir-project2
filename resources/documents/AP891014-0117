A Presidio County jury Friday found Eduardo Rodriguez Pinedaguilty in the attack after a weeklong trial. The jury sentencedRodriguez on Saturday. In Texas, the judge or jury may setpunishment at the option of the defendant.   Authorities said Rodriguez was one of four youths who stood atop300-foot-high canyon walls overlooking the river on Nov. 19, 1988,and fired shots that struck and killed Michael Heffley, 40, ofEastland. His wife, Jamie, and their rafting guide were wounded.   The shots were fired from the Mexican side of the river, andunder international law, a person standing in one country whofatally shoots a person in another country can be tried in eithernation.   ``I am disappointed,'' said Mrs. Heffley. ``They took intoaccount his age, but he didn't take into account my husband's life.The Bible says, `Thou shall not kill.'''   Defense attorneys asked the jury to give Rodriguez probation.Prosecutors had requested a life sentence.   Asked if he had anything to say, Rodriguez said through aninterpreter, ``Yes, I just want to ask for forgiveness for thatwith which I have been charged.''   Defense attorneys said they would appeal.   Two juveniles are in custody in Mexico in connection with thecase. All three are Mexican citizens, but Rodriguez is a legalresident of the United States and lives in Redford, 60 milesnorthwest of Big Bend National Park.</TEXT></DOC>
