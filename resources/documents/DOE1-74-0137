The anatomicaland clinical implications, both potential and real, of fractures or dislocationsof the wrist, are discussed briefly. It is stressed by the authors thatthe potential for a misdiagnosis, particularly in a case of trauma tothe wrist, certainly exists in instances where an absent or hypoplastichook of the hamate is present. It is also stressed that even though ahook of the hamate is not delineated radiologically, it may be presentin its cartilaginous form. Under such circumstances, imaging with magneticresonance might be helpful. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
