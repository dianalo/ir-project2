Adsorptionof CO{sub 2} on a clean Pd(100) surface is weak and nondissociative.However, the preadsorbed potassium dramatically affected the adsorptionbehavior of CO{sub 2} on Pd(100) and it caused significant changes inthe electron energy loss spectrum of adsorbed CO{sub 2}. It increased(i) the amount of weakly adsorbed CO{sub 2}, (ii) the rate of CO{sub2} adsorption, and (iii) the binding energy of CO{sub 2}, and (iv) itinduced the formation of new adsorption states and lowered the activationbarrier for dissociation. The lowest potassium coverage where the dissociationof CO{sub 2} was detected was theta = 0.21. The peak temperatures forCO desorption were 624 and 693 K, which are significantly higher thanthose measured for the clean Pd(100) surface. The adsorption of CO{sub2} on potassium-dosed Pd leads to a work function increase of 2.20 eVat nearly monolayer of potassium. This indicates a substantial chargetransfer from the potassium-dosed metal to an empty CO/sub 2{pi}/* orbital;as a result the bonding and the structure of adsorbed CO{sub 2} are basicallychanged. In the interpretation of the data a direct interaction betweenpreadsorbed K and CO{sub 2} leading to the formation of carbonate andCO is also considered.</TEXT></DOC>
