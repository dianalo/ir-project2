The subjects covered areas follows: (1) Description of genetic resource information -- items,evaluation criteria, and methodology, (2) standardization of notationand evaluation methods -- the gene nomenclature convention and linkagegroup determination for rice (Oryza sativa) as an example, (3) geneticresource information and its management at present, and (4) successfulexamples of genetic resource utilization -- breeding of middle-stalkwheat and rice, improvement soybean protein amino-acid composition, andutilization of genes which do not allow crossbreed.
