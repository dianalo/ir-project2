With strong support throughout Dixie, DemocratJesse Jackson made a last-minute appeal to minority voters.   It was the biggest day in the history of presidential primaries,one that could virtually settle the Republican race and give aclearer focus to the crowded Democratic contest.   Five candidates were among the voters.   ``If we exceed our expectations of live up to them, I thinkwe'll be in good shape,'' said Bush as he arrived at his pollingplace in Houston.   GOP rival Bob Dole told reporters in Missouri that ``it's goingto be a little tougher as we go along, but I've been in toughfights before.''   Dukakis voted in the Brookline section of Boston and denouncedas ``garbage'' television ads run this weekend by Sen. Albert GoreJr. of Tennessee. The ads said he let Massachusetts losemanufacturing jobs at a rate eight times the national average andthat his foreign policy views had been described as ``mushy.''   Jackson made one last pitch to black voters in Alabama andHispanic voters in Texas in his bid to translate Dixie appeal intodelegates.   Republican Pat Robertson was carrying David and Goliath dollswhen he arrived to vote in Virginia Beach, Va., and said theysymbolized his contest against Bush.   ``I am the conservative candidate and I will be the conservativecandidate all the way to New Orleans,'' he said, referring to thesite of the Republican National Convention.   Gore and his wife, Tipper, voted in Carthage, Tenn., and thecandidate said, ``I think we've got the momentum. I think we'regoing to have a good day.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri voted by absentee ballot.   Voters began to make their choices in 14 Southern and borderstates and in seven other locales as far afield as Hawaii andAmerican Samoa. Early reports on voter turnout ranged from light tomoderate in many Southern states to projections of a record turnoutin Texas. ``It's just a steady stream,'' said Vernon Tigner, theDemocratic judge at Cross Creek 22 in North Carolina.   It was raining in Arkansas and elections officials reported alight turnout except in black areas where it was heavy.   ``We are having a pretty heavy turnout,'' said JaniceMcClelland, a worker at a predominantly black precinct inCrittenden County.   Bush sounded confident of a solid delegate boost toward theRepublican nomination. Dole had already returned to the Midwest,flying to Illinois which holds its primary next Tuesday.   ``The person that clearly wins Super Tuesday is going to be thenominee of the party and I think the next president,'' Bush toldreporters in Tulsa on Monday.   Dole also was in Oklahoma and while conceding Bush was likely tocarry most Super Tuesday states, said, ``We don't want to lose theWhite House by nominating the wrong person.''   An ABC News poll of voters in Super Tuesday states said Bush wasleading in 16 of the 17 states holding Republican contests. Dolewas ahead only in Missouri.   ABC News said it interviewed a total of 8,659 voters across theregion between March 3 and 6 for the survey, but cautioned that itssamples in the non-Southern states were too small to producespecific numbers for the candidates. It said the margin of errorfor the Southern results was 3 percentage points either way.   The survey indicated that not only that Bush was leadingthroughout the South, but that his strongest leads were in the twobiggest states _ Texas with 111 delegates and Florida with 82.   Among the Democrats, Dukakis had a lock on his home state ofMassachusetts and Rhode Island and was leading in Florida, Marylandand by a narrow margin in Texas.   Jackson was the leader in Deep South states such as Alabama,Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as Arkansas, NorthCarolina and Virginia where blacks comprise up to 30 percent of theDemocratic electorate.   ``Hands that once picked cotton tomorrow morning will pick apresident,'' Jackson told an exuberant crowd at a rally inBirmingham, Ala. on Monday night.   Gore, banking on his Southern heritage and longest time spentcapaigning the region, was leading in Kentucky, Oklahoma andTennessee, according to the survey.   Gephardt, counting on winning support with a populist appeal,was said to be leading only in his home state.   A new poll published today in the Atlanta Journal-Constitutionalso gave Bush a wide lead in the South, finding him favored by 56percent of Republicans surveyed in 12 states in the region. On theDemocratic side, Jackson led with 29 percent support, followed byDukakis and Gore with 20 percent each.   For Robertson, the Southern primaries amounted to his last, bestchance to demonstrate that he could mount a serious challenge tothe establishment candidates. Despite a strong following amongevangelical Christians, the former television preacher has yet towin a GOP primary and was a disappointing third in South Carolinaon Saturday, a state he once boasted he would win ecisively.   ``Bush has me four to one,'' Robertson said Monday in Charlotte,N.C. ``I'm like David up against Goliath. But we will do very wellin the South.''   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York was given no chance of carrying aSuper Tuesday state and planned to meet with advisers on Wednesdayand was presumed to be ready to drop out of the race.   On the Democratic side, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois made noeffort in the Super Tuesday states and planned to resume hiscandidacy in his home state.   Gary Hart trudged on, attracting little notice and even lesssupport.   Holding Republican and Democratic primaries were Alabama,Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma,Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. In addition, Democratsin American Samoa, Hawaii, Idaho and Nevada were holding caucusesas were both parties in Washington.   Democrats in Minnesota, constrained by national party rules fromallocating delegates from their caucuses held two weeks ago, weredoing so tonight.   Dukakis was the big winner in Minnesota, but Jackson and Simonalso were expected to pick up delegates.   The states holding Republican primaries were selecting 712delegates, more than two-thirds of the 1,139 needed for aconvention majority.   On the Democratic side, the prize was 1,307 delegates. A totalof 2,082 were needed for the nomination.   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Bush 126, Dole65, Kemp 35 and Robertson 8. For the Democrats the count wasDukakis 69, Gephardt 50, Gore 21, Jackson 27, Simon 35, Hart 0, anduncommitted 258.   During a campaign flight in Missouri, Bush told reporters hewouldn't predict a sweep. ``It's too much for anyone to expect,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
