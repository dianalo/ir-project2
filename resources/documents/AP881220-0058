In all, 7,200 officials, 56 of whom were described ashigh-ranking government officials, have been punished in thecampaign, the People's Daily said. Of these, 1,100 officials havehad their cases referred to the nation's courts for criminalprosecution, it said.

In return, he was able to send his children to study inJapan, according to the report.   In another case, 71 workers at an aluminum factory took 14 tripsto the United States, France, Italy and Japan to research a singledeal. In all, they spent $216,000 of government money on the trips,the newspaper said.   ``In reality it was pure jobbery, using public funds for atourist trip,'' the paper said.   On Sunday, the paper reported that 30,000 inspectors were workingin 3,000 officies nationwide to fight Chinese corruption in dealingwith foreign companies.   In all, 1.7 million foreign trade contracts involving $150billion have been examined by officials, the paper said.   Since the campaign began in June 1987, investigators have opened15,600 cases, of which 7,500 have been solved, the paper said.   ``In its work concerning foreign trade, China has some major weaklinks and loopholes,'' the People's Daily said. ``There really doexist some corrupt officials doing international trade. Politicallyand economically, they create a very bad impression.''   Corruption is one of the major problems China faces as itattempts to open its economy to the West. Western companies wishingto do business in China are often forced by corrupt officials to paybribes or offer gifts just for the chance to do business withBeijing.   Internal corruption in China has also been blamed for causingprice rises. Illegal companies, often set up by sons and daughtersof powerful officials, buy goods at wholesale rates and sell themfor a profit, increasing the goods' price.   China's inflation hovers at about 20 percent to 30 percent, thehighest since the revolution in 1949.</TEXT></DOC>
