First, Mr. Mellor'spromotion underscores the increasing role of internationalsales at U.S. defense companies in general and GeneralDynamics in particular; in his present role at the St. Louiscompany, which he has played since 1986, Mr. Mellor hasconcentrated on marketing M-1 tanks and F-16 jet fightersabroad. As the U.S. defense budget is cut, success overseaswill become more crucial.   Mr. Rogers's decision to stay on indefinitely, meanwhile,is a sign of how much the company is determined to turnaround the A-12 aircraft line at its Fort Worth, Texas,factory, where the 65-year-old General Dynamics veteran isnow on special assignment. In the second quarter, the companyrecorded a $450 million charge on the A-12 program, which isexperiencing delays because of what Navy officials havedescribed as design problems and excessive weight.   &quot;We've got real heavy firepower on it&quot; to rectify the A-12situation, said William Anders, who is the company's currentvice chairman and who was named in September 1989 to becomechairman and chief executive officer when Stanley Paceretires at the end of this year.   Mr. Mellor was unavailable for comment yesterday. But Mr.Anders, in an interview, described his colleague as &quot;a solid,instinctive businessman.&quot;   &quot;Besides being an experienced man, he is a pleasantno-nonsense guy,&quot; Mr. Anders added.
