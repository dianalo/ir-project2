Walter Thompson's office herein June, yesterday split its $20 million to $25 million adaccount between two agencies, DDB Needham and Saatchi andamp;Saatchi DFS/Pacific.   DDB Needham's office here is the big winner, handling theestimated $18 million to $20 million account for the flagshipVons chain, which has 285 stores.</LP><TEXT>   Saatchi andamp; Saatchi's local agency will create ads forPavilions, Vons's upscale store chain that has just 28 units.Valdes Zacky Associates will continue to handle the verysmall Tianguis chain that's geared to Hispanic consumers.   But the new agencies may have difficulty scraping much ofa profit out of their new client, which, like otheradvertisers, is looking for ways to cut its costs. Whilesplitting its ad account, Vons said it's also assigningmedia-buying for all its stores to Western InternationalMedia here. While the account was at Thompson, that agencycreated ads and bought the chain's media time, receiving thestandard compensation of 15% of total billings.   The agencies instead will receive a fee for creating ads,managing the account and planning media schedules. Industryexecutives said DDB Needham, a unit of Omnicom Group, will bepaid an annual fee of about $1.5 million. Saatchi andamp; Saatchi'sfee will be much lower, since the much smaller Pavilionschain doesn't do much television advertising. Each agency'sagreement will include incentives built in to increasecompensation if customer traffic rises.   Before Vons announced its plans to split the creative andmedia functions, it told agencies it planned to pay them afee effectively equal to 7.5% of billings.   Dennis Eck, Vons's chief operating officer, said in aninterview that the financial arrangements with its newagencies are fair and will allow the shops to make a profit.&quot;We wanted to provide the agency with enough money so theycould provide high-quality basic service,&quot; he said. &quot;Wedidn't want to short an agency up front.&quot;   He said the &quot;traffic incentive&quot; would be a powerfuladdition to the compensation agreements that could bring anagency's fee up to a full 15% if certain previously agreedupon traffic goals were met. &quot;We both will have a strongdesire to build our store customer counts,&quot; Mr. Eck said.   Building store traffic at Vons outlets may be tough, sinceVons is already the No. 1 supermarket operator in the region.It controls about 21% of the market in Los Angeles County andabout 32% in San Diego County, according to CharlesCerankosky, an analyst at Kemper Securities Group inCleveland.   &quot;This doesn't mean they can't increase their leadfurther,&quot; he said. He estimates that Vons could pick up threeto seven market share points, but he warns that's notsomething that will happen overnight. &quot;That kind of growth isconceivable over a five-year period,&quot; he said.   Not all Los Angeles agencies were willing to compete forthe labor-intensive retail account under the low compensationterms. Dailey andamp; Associates, among others, dropped out of thereview after determining that it would be difficult to make aprofit. Still, other income-starved shops in this troubled admarket pulled out the stops to win Vons's favor. The otherfinalists included Della Femina McNamee andLintas:Campbell-Ewald.   ---   Lord Dentsu to Lose Peugeot                                                                                                          Peugeot S.A.'s decision to stop selling cars in the U.S.deals a blow to Lord, Dentsu andamp; Partners, the agency that hashandled the car maker's estimated $10 million account.   The French car maker yesterday said that, after years ofsteadily dropping sales, it would stop selling cars inSeptember. Dan Petit, national marketing manager for the U.S.arm, Peugeot Motors of America, said that the company wouldcontinue to work with Lord Dentsu to advertise the 700 carsremaining on dealer's lots, but that he expected those carsto be sold by the end of the year.   A Lord Dentsu spokeswoman said Peugeot's decision meantthe agency would aggressively pursue other car accounts. Theagency, a joint venture of Young andamp; Rubicam and Dentsu ofJapan, created the &quot;Beyond the Obvious&quot; campaign for Peugeot.The campaign got notice because of its print ads' unusualEuropean-style typefaces and placement in alternativemagazines that don't typically run car ads.   The loss follows a tumultuous period for Lord Dentsu,formed in February by the merger of Lord Einstein O'Neill andamp;Partners and HDM. Although the agency has won severalaccounts, including the $30 million Dole Foods business andthe recent Air New Zealand, HealthNet HMO and In Healthmagazine accounts, it has lost numerous clients, includingDannon yogurt, the New Yorker magazine, and more recently,the Lehman Brothers investment banking firm and Sandoz'sTavist-D allergy and cold medication.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
