Subway and railroad workers, meanwhile, threatened to holdanother one-day strike on Wednesday. It would be the fourth suchwalkout in four weeks.   But rail workers also agreed Monday to hold their first directnegotiations since May, raising hopes of a possible settlement inthe chronic transit dispute that has periodically forced millions toseek alternate transportation.   About 9,400 dockworkers at 60 ports went on strike at midnightMonday to protest the decision by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative government to scrap a 1947 law guaranteeing dockworkersjobs for life.   The law was enacted because of widespread labor abuses at thedocks during that time. Mrs. Thatcher's government, which has curbedmany union powers in the 10 years she has been in power, argued thatsuch a guarantee is outdated.   The National Association of Port Employers predicted the strikewould fail. The 60 ports affected handle just 43 percent of shippingtraffic, with the rest going through Britain's other 102 ports. Manyof the 102 have been developed since 1947 and were never covered bythe lifetime job guarantee.   Many shippers have arranged for cargoes to be transferred fromthe 60 ports affected by the strike to other ports.   But Ron Todd, general secretary of the 1.3 million-memberTransport and General Workers' Union to which the striking dockersbelong, said: ``Let's see what they (the port employers) say at theend of the first month or the second month or the third month of thestrike.''   The 48-hour strike by more than 500,000 members of the NationalAssociation of Local Government Officers is part of a series ofprotest strikes this year to demand higher wages. The walkouts havedisrupted municipal services ranging from library services togarbage collection.   Unions say a major cause of this summer's labor unrest isinflation eating into wages. Britain's annual rate of inflation nowstands at 8.3 percent, the highest it has been in seven years.   In other labor disputes this summer, strikes have regularlyclosed passport offices, halted London bus services and causedcancellation of news and current affairs programs on BritishBroadcasting Corp. television and radio.   Railroad and subway workers both planned one-day walkoutsWednesday to demand higher wages.   But hopes for an end to the rail dispute surfaced on Monday whenrail unions oficials agreed to meet today with British Rail, theboard that runs the state-owned network. It would be the firstdirect talks since early May.   The series of 24-hour strikes called by the 117,000-memberNational Union of Railwaymen have completely shut down the networkeach Wednesday since June 14.   On Monday, in a separate move, the 17,500 train drivers ofanother union, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers andFiremen, began an indefinite overtime ban, severely disruptingservices on a day-to-day basis.</TEXT></DOC>
