He has since shifted gears. Mr. Strong, fretting about rising interest rates and a booming economy, has recently built his cash hoard to the highest levels in six years -- and plans to raise it further.    &quot;We're like a race car driver going into a corner -- it's time to slow down,&quot; Mr. Strong says. &quot;When we come out of the corner, we'll gun it again.&quot;    Aggressively turning over the portfolio can pose potential problems, of course. &quot;He plays trends extremely hard and fast with a lot of trading,&quot; a competing fund manager says. Mr. Strong's funds do tend to have high transaction costs, with the portfolios averaging about 100% annual turnover. And the funds can get whipsawed more than most if hit with an unanticipated market move.    Still, Mr. Strong has shown skill in jumping on market trends. He doesn't try to call market moves; instead, he goes with the cost of money and runs with it. Last year, his portfolio adjustments helped sidestep some of the carnage suffered by many stock funds. This year, he has picked up where he left off. Three of his seven funds have posted double-digit gains through Aug. 11, led by a 24% rise in the $9.6 million Strong Discovery Fund.    What he's worried about now is a surging economy. He sees the recent interest-rate rise continuing, which would be negative for most stocks. But it's not only economic indicators that move him; he goes by other, more tangible, signs that he sees in his native Midwest.    Most perceptible is a shortage of labor. A few years ago, he says, he would drive by a plant and see bulldozers knocking down part of the building and signs saying, 'No hiring.' Now, he says, &quot;they're putting the bricks back up and have signs like: 'Needed: 14 Welders.'&quot;    His strategy stems from the &quot;feast-famine phenomenon&quot; he grew up with in North Dakota, colleagues and fund specialists say. &quot;He's got a profound and deep conviction of the cyclicality of the system,&quot; says Michael Stolper, a San Diego investment adviser who uses the Strong group to manage $100 million in pension assets for clients. &quot;He deals with the world as it is, rather than the way he'd like it to be.&quot;    Mr. Strong agrees. His background, he says, &quot;is tatooed on my forehead.&quot; As for his cash holdings, he says he won't back down until the economy slows and he sees signs of interest rates topping out. And he doesn't expect that for awhile. His cash positions, which have gradually risen this year, have accelerated recently. From the crash until July, for instance, Mr. Strong's funds were net buyers of securities; since then, they've been net sellers, he says.    Meantime, half of the money he still has invested in equities is in arbitrage plays. He has benefited from announced deals, for instance, in Macmillan Inc., Interco and Farmers Group -- the last of which makes up 5% of his Total Return, Investment and Opportunity funds.    The other half of his positions is in what he calls positive cash flow issues. These include Quaker Oats and Ralston Purina products that are used every day in good times or in bad.    Some of his portfolios cost more than others. Strong's $12 million Government Fund, $167 million Income Fund and $47 million Short-Term Bond Fund are no-load. But the $269 million Investment Fund and $956 million Total Return Fund charge 1%, and the Discovery Fund and $174 million Opportunity Fund levy an up-front fee of 2%. The last two are riskier, he says, and the load should lead investors to leave their money in the fund for the long term.    Meantime, the Strong group will launch a new hybrid fund this autumn -- essentially a cross between a money market and a short-term bond fund. Unlike a money market fund, the asset value will vary with interest rates but it's not expected to be as risky as some longer-term bond funds. Expected to be called Cash Plus Fund, the portfolio probably will register a yield of as much as 1.5% higher than a money market fund, Mr. Strong says.    What about closed-end funds? Though they're the hottest sector of the fund industry, Mr. Strong says he's avoiding them. (Closed-end funds manage pools of investor money like their more popular mutual-fund cousins, but issue a fixed number of shares that trade on the open market at a premium or discount to their net asset value.)    Noting the discounts that some closed-end funds have fallen to from their initial offering price, Mr. Strong says: &quot;We want people to make money, not lose it.&quot;    ---                     Strong's Cash Shift                                      Cash Position         Fund                      Aug. 17     June 30         Opportunity                 59%         33%         Total Return                54          36         Investment                  76          71         Discovery                   67          31         Income                      63          44         Government                  81          59         Short-Term Bond             66          64         Source: Strong/Corneliuson Capital Mgt.
