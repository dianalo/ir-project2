In the case of high acceleration,turbulent transition takes place simultaneously over the whole area inthe pipe. This is due to the instability of the flow, and can be explainedby the linear theory because the viscosity of the flow exerts no influencesonto the inside of the pipe. In this case, almost the same changes incross-section velocity profile and disturbance intensity are found overthe whole area in the pipe substantially without any disturbance developedafter the transition. In the case of relatively low acceleration, theturbulent transition originally generated near the pipe inlet forms adiscontinuous surface, which propagates toward the downstream. Accordingly,the transition time is varied depending on the position in the pipe.In this case, the relative value of disturbance in the same cross-sectionof the pipe is the highest immediately after the transition. Also, withthe velocity increased, the disturbance itself is developed. The propagationvelocity of the transition surface is higher than the mean flow velocityand, in some cases, the max. velocity in the cross-section. (11 figs,1 tab, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
