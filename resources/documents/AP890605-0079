President Bush last week proposed ceilings on troops, tanks,combat aircraft and attack helicopters, artillery and armoredpersonnel as part of a revised NATO response to Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev's planned cuts in Warsaw Pact forces.   ``If mutual reductions take place in Europe, American forceswill be withdrawn across the Atlantic while Soviet forces willremain at the other end of the European rail network,'' Sen. EdwardKennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Armed Servicessubcommittee on projection forces and regional defense, said at ahearing of the panel.   ``In such an environment, a robust fast sealift program would bea crucial element of continued conventional deterrence in Europe,''Kennedy said.   But the Massachusetts Democrat said the ``biggest gap toreinforce NATO Europe is in fast sealift,'' a complaint that wasechoed by a series of former and present Pentagon officials.   Witnesses told the Senate committee that U.S. sealift capabilityhas suffered as the nation's merchant marine has declined andannual spending for research and development in shipbuilding hasdecreased from $4.4 million to $500,000.   ``Our long suit is people and technology and we're exploitingneither in the world today,'' said Gen. Duane H. Cassidy,commander-in-chief of the U.S. Transportation Command.   Robert Costello, the Pentagon's former undersecretary foracquisition, expressed dismay over Japan's 60-knot cargo ship, twoor three times as fast as conventional ships. ``We don't haveanything like that on the agenda,'' he said.   Bush's proposal would reduce U.S. deployments in Europe fromabout 330,000 troops to about 275,000. The president proposed thesame ceiling for Soviet deployments in eastern European countriesoutside the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
