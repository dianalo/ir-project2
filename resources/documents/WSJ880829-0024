U.S. investment bankers, in particular, are dangling high yields on hordes of takeover funds, junk bonds and bridge loans before Japanese clients, which are abandoning some of their traditional reluctance to invest in low-grade debt.    Japanese investors in this area are still limited to select banks, trading houses, leasing companies and wealthy manufacturers. But the roster of willing Japanese suppliers of funds to support takeovers, leveraged buy-outs and similar transactions in the U.S. is growing, as competitors become envious of healthy profits earned by aggressive industry leaders.    &quot;The margins are very high, even on the senior debt portion&quot; of the financing for a restructuring in the U.S., says Naoaki Ishida, joint general manager of credit and economics at the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. The bank is seen as one of the biggest players among Japanese banks in helping to fund leveraged buy-outs in the U.S., often acting as agent on the bank-loan portion of the financing.    The type of Japanese investor participating in this sort of financing is considerably different from those long accustomed to buying U.S. stocks or Treasury bonds. Often, these investors borrow dollars to make investments, and are simply trying to earn a satisfactory spread above their funding cost.    But while the spread is important, buyers and sellers agree the more important consideration is credit quality.    It is up to investment bankers, mostly with U.S.-based firms, to convince Japanese institutions that lending to the American company going through a restructuring is worth the risk.    &quot;Sometimes poor deals are popular if they have well-known names,&quot; says a specialist in Tokyo for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    For the kind of deals Japanese investors like, investment bankers estimate companies here may purchase 10% to 15% of an issue. For some of the &quot;mega-deals,&quot; Japanese participation has been up to 50%. &quot;They are a real growing force,&quot; the Drexel official says.    In contrast with U.S. high-yield portfolio managers, even decisions by senior Japanese executives must be approved by high-level committees, often the directors. Without special approval, many Japanese institutions typically won't put money into debt rated lower than double-A.    Thus, when middle-level officials at Japanese companies would like to participate in a U.S. financing, they must make a presentation to the upper management.    &quot;They like famous names best,&quot; says Hidemi Fukuhara, executive director of the corporate institutions department at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.    &quot;When junk bonds were first introduced to Japan, investors didn't like them, for they are careful about credit,&quot; he says. &quot;But in LBOs, big names like Safeway, Burlington and Borg-Warner are well-known here.&quot;    Before going through a restructuring, these kinds of companies offered narrow spreads when they issued high-grade debt in the U.S. or Euromarkets, Mr. Fukuhara says. Now, the bank-loan portion of an LBO financing might bring 1 1/2 to two percentage points over the London interbank offered rate, and subordinated notes may yield two to two and a half percentage points over Libor, according to the Merrill official.    Many of the trading and leasing companies can fund themselves in the short-term markets at Libor plus about one-third of a percentage point, so those kind of spreads can be quite appealing, investment bankers and Japanese investors say.    The general manager for international finance at a top Japanese leasing company says spreads are narrowing on high-grade debt, and a lack of alternatives is forcing the industry to look more at U.S. restructurings.    &quot;The pure leasing business is getting smaller every year,&quot; he says. &quot;It is now less than 30% of our total, so we have to diversify.&quot;    The general manager says his leasing company has participated in short-term bridge loans and has bought junk bonds, and is now considering investing in LBO funds.    Investment bankers say many U.S. companies are structuring their financings specifically with such investors as the Japanese in mind. Private placements can be tailored especially well.    Recent guidelines issued by the Bank for International Settlements concerning risk-weighting for bank assets have also spurred Japanese interest in higher yields, analysts say.    &quot;The BIS rules are causing a demand for higher spreads, so investors are moving at a faster pace down the credit curve. It has helped some issuers who couldn't get Japanese funding before,&quot; the Drexel high-yield specialist says.    Still, many Japanese investors wonder if they can adequately assess the risks of high-yield debt, and this has spurred some to limit their involvement to funds.    Masami Tsukamoto, manager of the bond market department at C. Itoh andamp; Co., a major trading house, says &quot;we don't have the specialists to analyze high-yield bonds. He says C. Itoh would like to invest in individual junk bonds, but doesn't contemplate being able to do so for several years. </TEXT></DOC>
