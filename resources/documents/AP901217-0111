(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   You can drink, dance or listen to a discjockey at the Basix nightclub, but if you want to light a cigaretteyou've got to go outside.   ``It's an enlightenment for customers who suddenly realize theydon't have to put up with cigarette smoke. There is analternative,'' said bar owner Bill Watkins, who opened thenightclub Oct. 31 in a partnership with Pittsburgh Steelers'football player Chuck Lanza.   ``When you walk through the door, just take a breath and you cansmell the difference,'' said Watkins, who has asthma.   Outside, a billboard reads: ``Try smoke-free air for a change.Draft beer $1.''   The owners say they've had no major problem because of thepolicy.   ``Every once in a while you get somebody in here who isn't awareof the policy, and they'll light a cigarette. And everyone willturn and look at them. It's just like they totally ostracize them.You don't have to say a word,'' Watkins said. ``When they're toldit's smoke-free, they put it out very graciously. And that's theend of it.''   At least one other bar in the country - the Jazz Showcase inChicago's Blackstone Hotel - also bans smoking.   On Fridays and Saturdays, the South Bend club has about 500customers, each paying a $3 cover charge, the owners say.   Watkins admits there was much skepticism that the bar wouldsucceed.   ``No one believed it literally. We were fought from day one,''he said.   But Watkins cites studies from the American tobacco industrysaying only 22 percent of the American public smokes.   ``I think this country is ready for a smokeless kind of livingenvironment,'' said Lanza.</TEXT></DOC>
