The study said its conclusions applied to developments likely inthe next five years, mostly in agriculture and mostly to organismsproduced using the so-called ``recombinant'' techniques forinserting genes of one species into the DNA _ the genetic material_ of another.   So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kindor another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said.These include plants engineered to resist pests, pesticides ordiseases; bacteria to confer on plants resistance to frost; and newanimal vaccines.   Researchers are planning engineered microbes that canconcentrate metallic ores and digest toxic wastes.   ``It is important to note that modifying organisms for specifichuman ends is not new,'' the study said. ``Selective breeders ofplants and animals have been transferring genes for millennia,often creating forms through centuries of selection that differfrom their original stocks more than the forms produced byrecombinant DNA methods.''   In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably couldease or control damage, if any, from experiments gone awry, thereport said.   ``In those rare circumstances of a negative impact on a naturalcommunity, the consequence seems most likely to be a transitorydisturbance of plant or animal community structure,'' the studysaid.   The worst possibilities appear to be ``to disrupt a fundamentalecosystem process,'' it said.   The existence in ecosystems of many species performing the samefunctions, and the resilience of ecosystems, ``are persuasivearguments against the likelihood of such consequences,'' it said.   Regulatory agencies soon should have enough experience to ``sortplanned introductions into broad categories for which low, mediumor high levels of review are appropriate,'' OTA said.   ``Counter examples can be provided from existing experience tonegate almost any proposed category from review,'' but experienceis piling up so fast that the agencies might be able to easerequirements in some cases even to the point of exemptions fromreview, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
