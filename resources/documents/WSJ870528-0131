We're just following their example and should have the same freedom they have.&quot; Seven or eight years later our more jaded readers may find confirmation of their belief that, in time, everything repeats itself, whether as tragedy, farce or just confusion. Writing in the very liberal United Church News of the very liberal United Church of Christ, the Rev. Richard Hughes responds to the criticism that the UCC is too political: &quot;I don't see anyone criticizing Jerry Falwell or Pat Robinson for their brand of political religion. So why not give the rest of us the same freedom?&quot; This is perhaps the first instance of what was once the mainline and is now the old-line invoking the precedent of the new mainline in order to justify its participation in public life. Historians of American religion, take note. </TEXT></DOC>
