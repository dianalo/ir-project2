The firm is looking for a buyer for a short-term tax-exempt securities program that brought it a lot of corporate clients. The program, called daily adjustable tax-exempt securities, or Dates, lets municipalities and corporations issue securities that investors can sell back to the issuer as often as every day. Salomon re-markets the securities to other investors, so the issuer doesn't actually have to buy them.    Salomon last week met with a number of rival firms to try to interest them in taking the program over -- if possible, for a price. Thomas McCaughey, a managing director at Salomon and the program's inventor, says the main reason for transferring the program rather than simply pulling out as the re-marketer, is &quot;to do the right thing&quot; for clients. &quot;But we think it would be rational for someone to pay for it.&quot;    Salomon will have to move fast, however, if it's going to have anything left to sell. Many of the firm's rivals, which have their own similar programs, already are poaching Dates clients. By the time Salomon can get the program transferred, the bulk of the clients already may have jumped ship.    &quot;We got six telephone calls within four hours&quot; of Salomon's announcement earlier this month that it was getting out of the municipal business, says John C. Pope, chief financial officer of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, which has $293 million of Dates outstanding. AMR plans to meet with all the firms that are after its business &quot;and see who can offer us the best deal.&quot;    Indeed, Dates issuers probably would resent any suggestion that they automatically would move to the program's new owner. &quot;It would depend on who they sell it to,&quot; said Joseph L. Donnelly, executive vice president at Gulf States Utilities Co. &quot;It's like a doctor trying to sell his practice.&quot;    At least one potential bidder is thinking of tying his offer to Salomon's ability to deliver clients. &quot;We don't know what Salomon can deliver,&quot; said D. Lee Hayes, manager of the municipal securities division at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., &quot;so we would have to make our bid contingent&quot; on the size of the transferred client list. Mr. Hayes added that Shearson, which would like to have more short-term tax-exempt securities to sell, plans to bid but hasn't decided how much compensation to offer -- if any.    Although the municipal business as a whole hasn't been profitable for Salomon, firm officials claim the Dates program has been a moneymaker. About $4 billion of the securities currently are outstanding, and the firm collected a yearly re-marketing fee of 0.125% of that, or $5 million. Officials decline to say how much is eaten up by expenses, but they insist the firm's back-office systems are efficient enough to leave a &quot;substantial&quot; profit.    In addition, the product has been an effective introduction to new corporate clients. (Corporations issue Dates and other tax-exempt securities by setting up a municipal entity to serve as the actual issuer. Proceeds of the offering flow through to the corporation, which also guarantees the issue.)    The tax-exempt business &quot;was where Salomon got in the door with Mead,&quot; said Keith A. McBride, director of corporate finance at Mead Corp., which has more than $161 million of Dates outstanding. Salomon's leaving the business &quot;will change our dealings some.&quot; But he and some other clients say they expect to continue to do business with Salomon.    &quot;This one product has been a wonderful success in opening up the firm to a list of clients with whom we hadn't previously done business,&quot; agreed Mr. McCaughey, who has spent a good deal of the past three years promoting the product. &quot;There's a certain sadness&quot; in having to hand it over to a rival.    Salomon has asked the firms that would like to take over the product to submit proposals by Wednesday, and it promises to choose a successor within a week. Even so, it may take until the end of the year to complete the transfer, officials say. </TEXT></DOC>
