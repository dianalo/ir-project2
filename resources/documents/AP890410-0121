The EEC had balked at the earlier U.S. insistence that alltrade-distorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the longhaul. The agreement reached in Geneva last week by more than 100countries calls for a ``substantial progressive reduction'' in suchsubsidies.   Yeutter, in an interview with a group of reporters, said theEuropeans had objected to earlier language calling for the``elimination'' of the subsidies and later to a modified``ratcheting'' down of them.   Asked if the final language represented backtracking on the partof the United States in its quest to do away eventually withtrade-distorting subsidies and other practices, Yeutter replied:``I don't consider it backtracking at all.''   Indeed, he said, there is no practical difference between``elimination'' or ``racheting'' or the accepted ``substantialprogressive reduction'' of subsidies, regardless of what someEuropean leaders may feel.   ``They may have their own reasons for articulating the outcomeof the meeting as they have,'' Yeutter said. ``Obviously, everyonewill go home and, to some degree, at least, articulate their owninterpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs.''   The accord provides a framework for further discussions underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a four-year effortcalled the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize global trade. Thecurrent GATT round will conclude at the end of 1990.   As part of the Geneva agreement, participants agreed to anoverall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990.   Yeutter said the U.S. goal is to gain long-term accord on thefuture of agricultural trade and that the short-term agreementreached in Geneva, while acceptable, was no big challenge for U.S.negotiators.   Some American farm leaders, including Dean Kleckner of theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, had urged Congress to proceedwriting a new general farm bill on an assumption that littleprogress could be expected under the GATT talks.   Yeutter said he had no objection to Congress proceeding with anew farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year.And Yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislationuntil it was clearer how the GATT talks would shape up.   ``Somehow that got misinterpreted ... because that's not reallywhat I meant at all,'' Yeutter said.   ``Assuming that (GATT) negotiations are a success, the 1990 farmlegislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991,'' hesaid. ``But I never meant to indicate that we shouldn't havefull-scale farm legislation in 1990.''   On the matter of U.S. export subsidies used in the ExportEnhancement Program, or EEP, Yeutter said it was ``our view that weare not constrained on EEP expenditures.''   Yeutter said further that he still favors Congress removing thelid on EEP spending so that the United States can match theunrestrained export subsidies of the Europeans. The program, hesaid, was a major factor in reaching an aggreement in Geneva lastweek.</TEXT></DOC>
