The voting trust allows American, a unit of AMR Corp., to purchase the majority stake in ACI Holdings, but American won't be able to exert control over AirCal until the department gives final approval to the merger. The trust will be run by an independent trustee, MBank Dallas, a unit of MCorp, American said.    As previously reported, American agreed last month to buy ACI, the Newport, Ca.-based parent company of the West Coast carrier, for about $225 million. As a first step in that transaction, it agreed to buy six million shares, or slightly more than 70% of the common stock outstanding, from ACI's two principal shareholders, William Lyon and George L. Argyros, for $15 a share. Those shares will be put into the voting trust as soon as possible, American said.    American said it asked the department for expedited approval of the acquisition. The company said it doesn't expect the department to oppose the merger because there isn't any significant route overlap between American and AirCal. </TEXT></DOC>
