Maxwell and staff design a medical diagnosis codingdatabase system to ease the process of retrieving data onpatients' discharge diagnoses for insurance and clinical purposes.andO;Consistent wording of the diagnoses was a key goal of the system,and rules for nomenclature were implemented.andP;  The first databasewas set up by coding diagnoses of patients seen for one month,following the guidelines in the International Classification ofDisease, ninth revision, Clinical Modification.andP;  After threeyears, the database was stable at approximately 3000 diagnoses;only 10% of the entries require manual correction.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Data Base DesignMedical DiagnosisData Base Management SystemsCodesCodingAutomationBilling-Invoicing.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Ground rules regarding nomenclature for discharge diagnoses.andO;(table)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
