Professor Henry Green, head of Judaic studies at the Universityof Miami, hopes to change all that.   ``When you think of Florida and Jews you basically think ofcondo commandos searching for early-bird specials,'' Green said.``But the Jews have been here since the beginning, contributingsince the beginning.''   The history of Florida Jews has been compiled into an exhibitentitled ``Mosaic, Jewish Life in Florida.'' It is on display atMiami's Historical Museum of Southern Florida through Jan. 6. Thenit will travel the state for two years and head to Israel in 1993.   About 90 percent of Florida's 750,000 Jews live in the threeSouth Florida counties of Palm Beach, Broward and Dade, making itthe region with the third largest population of Jews in the world,after Israel and the New York area.   The exhibit began as a grass-roots project for a Jewishcommunity center in Plantation, a sleepy suburban city west of FortLauderdale, and blossomed into a collection of thousands of Jewishartifacts, documents, photographs and oral histories donated bypeople from two dozen Jewish communities around the state.   It has become an official project of the Christopher ColumbusQuincentenary in two years, which marks the 500th anniversary ofthe Italian explorer's arrival in the Western Hemisphere.   Green, director of Mosaic, believes at least five crew memberson Columbus' first voyage were ``conversos,'' Jews who converted toChristianity in an attempt to save their lives during the SpanishInquisition.   ``We have survived for so long, but you can't perpetuate unlessyou know your own history,'' said Beverly Kaiman of Pensacola,where the state's first Sephardic Jews settled in 1763.   Her relatives first came to Pensacola, located in the Floridapanhandle, from Russia at the turn of the century. The familydonated a Russian teapot, a ``yahzheit,'' which is a record ofdebts owed by relatives, and several photographs to the exhibit.   Jean Leibert has lived in Miami since 1956. She said the exhibitshowed her ties to the state she didn't know she had.   ``It's given me more of a strong feeling of being a part ofFlorida, like I have roots here,'' she said.   Leibert said she was surprised to learn that Levy County wasnamed after one of the first Jewish families in Florida.   Moses Levy, fleeing anti-Semitism in Morocco, landed in CentralFlorida in 1819 and bought 52,000 acres of land near Gainesville. Astrict Zionist, he intended to create a ``New Jerusalem.''   That plan failed when few Jews answered his ads in Europeannewspapers. Levy's son, David Levy Yulee, who helped draftFlorida's constitution, was the first Jewish U.S. senator.   Other little-known facts Mosaic's researchers discovered:   - Jewish women in the 19th century made their dishes kosher bywashing them with sand and sea water in Pensacola and Miami Beach.   - In the 1950s, the Jewish owners of the South Beach BlackstoneHotel on Miami Beach invited black Baptist ministers to be theirguests when the ministers could find no other accommodations inracially segregated Miami.   - Key West Jews in the 1890s formed the Committee to Aid theCubans, supporting the revolution against Spain. In gratitude,revolutionary leader Jose Marti paid a courtesy visit to committeechairman Louis Fine.   Also part of Mosaic is a U.S. Army-supplied knapsack withcandles and a kiddush cup for ritual prayer.   The items were used during World War II by Rabbi SidneyLefkowitz of Jacksonville, the military chaplain who performed thefirst Jewish service in Germany after the Holocaust.   One old photograph in the exhibit is of Marcus Joseph Weinkle, aRussian Jew who was called to serve in the Russian army in 1887.Just before he was to leave, his family the announced he hadsuddenly died.   After he was buried, he crawled out of his grave and tookclothes and money that had been hidden for him and smuggled himselfout of the country through Turkey. Weinkle eventually moved toMoffit, Fla., where he opened a lumber mill.   Stephen Whitfield, a professor of American studies at BrandeisUniversity in Waltham, Mass., said the exhibit was importantbecause South Florida was the best hope for the future of theJewish South.   ``It's the only spot in the South where Jewish life will bevibrant, so the caliber and character of that community iscrucial,'' he said.   The exhibit also could help improve ethnic relations in SouthFlorida, said Joseph Mensch, a trustee of the historical museum.   ``Miami is a multiethnic society that must learn to get alongwith each other,'' Mensch said. ``This adds to the melting pot thathelps us live together.''</TEXT></DOC>
