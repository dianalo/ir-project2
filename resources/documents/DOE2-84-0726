Approximately 200 artificiallyproduced nuclides are commercially available from reactors or acceleratorsources. Another 400 or so have properties which may make them usefulif satisfactory methods of production can be developed. One of the mosteconomically important industrial applications of radionuclides has beenin wear measurement and condition monitoring in reciprocating engines.The general techniques developed for this purpose have also been appliedin a number of other areas besides engine or lubrication studies. Thewear of floor wax applied to linoleum, for example, has been measuredby mixing shortlived radionuclides in the wax. In those applicationswhere the material is tagged and then followed, the radionuclides aretermed &quot;tracers,&quot; similar to the medical tracer materials used to measureuptake or metabolism of biologically active chemicals in the body. Thealternate function for the radionuclides is to act as &quot;markers&quot; whichindicate the amount of material which is remaining at the location ofthe original activation. Both approaches require that the debris removedfrom the surface must be carried away from the original site. The firstapplication of radioactive tracers as a diagnostic tool in engines wasin 1949. In this technique, an entire wearing part such as a piston ringor gear was first exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor. This causedthe entire volume of the part to become radioactive. The part was nextinstalled and exposed to wear in the operating engine. Detectors placednear the oil line, an oil filter or a sediment trap then determined theamount of debris from the part by counting the gamma rays escaping fromthe debris.</TEXT></DOC>
