The suit is one of a growing number of cases in whichpublic figures sue on grounds that an article or broadcastcreated a false impression, even if each statement takenseparately was true. In a ruling yesterday, the U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in San Francisco found that most of thefactual statements in the broadcast were undisputed and thatany false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate orreckless.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public figures can'twin a libel case unless they prove that a statement wasfalse, defamatory and published with knowledge of its falsityor with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.But Mr. Newton had alleged that he had been defamed byimplication and that the reporters must take responsibilityfor the impressions they intentionally conveyed.   The suit arose out of an Oct. 6, 1980, segment on NBC'sevening news titled &quot;Wayne Newton and the Law.&quot; Mr. Newtonargued that the NBC report created the impression that he hadreceived financial assistance from organized-crime figures tofinance the purchase of a hotel. Among other things, he citedthe reporters' failure to include in the broadcast the factthat he received a bank loan to finance the purchase.   In December 1986, a jury in a Las Vegas, Nev., federaldistrict court found that the broadcast had created a falseimpression and awarded Mr. Newton $19.2 million in damages.Judge Myron Crocker, who heard the case, reduced the award to$5.2 million, setting aside the jury's award for loss ofincome and reducing an award for injury to reputation to$50,000 from $5 million.   &quot;Wayne Newton's case poses the danger that First Amendmentvalues will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of aprominent local public figure against an alien speaker whocriticizes that local hero,&quot; the appeals court wrote.   The appeals panel said that NBC could not be held liableeven if the broadcast created a false impression as Mr.Newton alleged. The panel said the lower court improperlyconsidered its own view of the supposed false impressioninstead of the intentions of the journalists who prepared thebroadcast. Such an approach, the panel wrote, &quot;would permitliability to be imposed not only for what was not said butalso for what was not intended to be said.&quot;   The panel did not rule on whether the broadcast as a wholewas false. Instead, it based the ruling on the fact that Mr.Newton had failed to show sufficient evidence that thereporters deliberately lied or had been reckless with thetruth.   Morton Galane, the Reno, Nev., lawyer who represented Mr.Newton, said he could not comment because he was unable toreach his client.   &quot;This is a case that never should have been brought orgone to a jury in the first place. But the decision reaffirmsthe willingness of the courts to afford protection in thelibel area when the jury system goes haywire,&quot; said FloydAbrams of the New York firm Cahill, Gordon andamp; Reindel, alawyer for NBC.   ---   RACKETEERING CHARGES FILED against Asian fraternalorganization.   A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted the On LeongChinese Merchants Association, and chapters of the nationwideorganization in three U.S. cities, on racketeering, gamblingand tax-fraud charges.   The 34-count indictment -- which followed a 30-monthinvestigation -- alleges the operation of what prosecutorscall a &quot;nationwide illegal gambling business.&quot; On Leongchapters in Chicago, Houston, and New York were also accusedin the indictment of operating &quot;casino-style&quot; centersfeaturing games of chance such as pai gow and fan-tan. Alsonamed as defendants were 29 officials and members of theso-called tong, or association.   Under racketeering law, prosecutors are seeking forfeitureof certain On Leong properties, including the nationalheadquarters in New York, as well as about $11.5 million inproceeds from the alleged gambling operation.   On Leong officials couldn't immediately be reached forcomment.   The indictment leans heavily on telephone conversations atthe Chicago chapter, which federal agents raided and closeddown in 1988.   The indictment also cites conversations between thedefendants and Simon Au Yeung, an informant hired by theFederal Bureau of Investigation to penetrate illegal Asianorganizations in the U.S. Mr. Au Yeung played a role in theFBI's 1988 investigation.   More recently he worked undercover to assist federal andNew York authorities in seizing 850 pounds of Southeast Asianheroin allegedly imported by a different Chinese group.   ---   DECISION BARRING REPORTERS from taking notes during trialis appealed.   Attorneys for the Philadelphia Daily News are appealing ajudge's order prohibiting a reporter from taking notes duringa first-degree murder trial.   The order, handed down by Philadelphia Common Pleas JudgeEdward J. Maier, is thought to be unprecedented. Judge Maierruled at a hearing in his chambers that he had a &quot;gutfeeling&quot; against allowing reporters to take notes, accordingto a court transcript.   The judge said the notes could be used to challenge theofficial court record and that the taking of notes coulddistract jurors.   &quot;It might cause the jury to give greater attention to sometestimony rather than other testimony,&quot; Judge Maier ruled.   The ruling came after Daily News reporter Joseph P. Blakewas told by a court bailiff to stop taking notes on Aug. 20.The judge noted that few reporters ever cover trials in hiscourt but that he has nonetheless forbidden note-taking for10 years. Allowing reporters to take notes, he said, couldlead to allowing tape recorders and cameras.   Courts have generally been protective of the right ofspectators to take notes and sketch pictures during trials,particularly news gatherers, said Katherine Hatton, of thePhiladelphia law firm Kohn, Savett, Klein andamp; Graf, whichrepresents the Daily News, published by PhiladelphiaNewspapers Inc., a unit of Knight-Ridder Inc. of Miami.   In 1980 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that reporters attrials function as &quot;surrogates for the public,&quot; and thereforecan be entitled under the First Amendment to special seatingand priority entry, Ms. Hatton wrote in her appeal to thePennsylvania Superior Court.   The issue of whether reporters can be barred from takingnotes, however, has never come up in a court case, Ms. Hattonsaid.   ---   SUPERFUND ENFORCEMENT CHIEF is to join law firm.
