About 1,000 people protested plans for a highway throughdowntown Prague Wednesday with a march in the capital that policedid not move to break up.   They did prevent protesters from marching to governmentheadquarters but their restraint was a departure from brutaltactics of the past.   Helmeted riot police have routinely beaten and arrested peoplewho stage demonstrations, most recently on Oct. 28 whenanti-government protesters in Prague sought to mark the anniversaryof the country's 1918 independence.   On Wednesday, a court in Bratislava sentenced oppositionactivist Miroslav Kusy to an eight-month suspended sentence andacquitted three others. The activists had signed a statement urgingSlovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Soviet invasionthat crushed reforms.   In the past, Kusy would almost certainly have been jailed.   On Tuesday, Premier Ladislav Adamec announced that Czechoslovakswishing to travel to the West will no longer need exit visasbeginning Jan. 1.   In today's editions, The New York Times quoted Communist Partyofficials as saying the Soviet Union had warned Czechoslovakia lastweek that further stalling on political reforms that have overtakenother East bloc countries could cause serious trouble.   The newspaper said Moscow had cautioned Prague in a high-levelmessage not to make the same mistakes as Communist hard-linerselsewhere.   The message cited East Germany, which opened its borders a weekago under the pressure of a peaceful popular revolt that began theOctober weekend that Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited to mark the 40thanniversary of the Communist state and encouraged the country'sCommunist leaders to get in step.   A senior adviser to one Czech minister said the message wassimilar to one sent to Bulgaria that apparently helped persuadeTodor I. Zhivkov that it was time to retire after 35 years inpower, according to the Times.   In 1968, Soviet tanks and troops led a Warsaw Pact invasion thatousted the Czechoslovakian government of Alexander Dubcek when ittried to effect democratic reforms in what became known as the``Prague Spring.''   Now the Soviet Union is leading a wave of reform among East blocstates. Poland and Hungary have followed Moscow's lead.Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania have resisted, however.   Up to 1,000 people took part in the rally Wednesday nearPrague's Old Town Square. They protested plans to build asuperhighway through the Stromovka Park, Prague's largest. So far458 people have signed a petition seeking a referendum on the issue.   The demonstrators divided into two groups, with one marchingtoward the Romanian Embassy to protest that country's move a yearago to crush a demonstration by workers in Brasov, Romania'ssecond-largest city.   A larger group sought to cross Charles Bridge to reach buildingshousing the national government. Lines of police, many in riotgear, blocked the other side of the bridge. There was no violence.   Some of the protesters sat down, lighted candles and sang ``WeShall Overcome.'' The crowd then rose to sing the national anthem.   The riot police left a short time later. There were some shoutsfrom the crowd, including ``We want a new government'' and``Germany, Germany,'' an apparent reference to the dramatic changesin East Germany.   The remaining police began to move and the crowd walked backacross the bridge, again singing the national anthem.   More police moved in when the crowd surged toward the Old TownSquare, shouting ``Czechs, come with us.''   ``You should protect us,'' they shouted at police. A small groupof demonstrators baited police and three were taken away.   The demonstration was peaceful, although toward the end officerspushed some of the protesters, who then gradually dispersed.   A much larger demonstration was expected Friday to mark the 50thanniversary of the first Czech uprising against the Nazi occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
