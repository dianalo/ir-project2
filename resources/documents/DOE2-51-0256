Ultra sonography and computedtomography are helpful in the identification of peripancreatic and intra-abdominalfluid collections. Sterile fluid collections can be effectively treatedby percutaneous catheter drainage, whereas most intra-abdominal infectionsrequire surgical intervention. Angiography is performed primarily fordiagnosis of vascular thrombosis. Recent results suggest that magneticresonance may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of pancreatictransplant rejection. Further imaging studies are needed to better definethe development of progressive fibrotic atrophy in long-term functioningpancreatic transplants.</TEXT></DOC>
