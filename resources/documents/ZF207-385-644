(products).andO;Product:   Software Through Pictures 4.0 (CASE software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationProgram Development ToolsComputer-Aided Software EngineeringSystems AnalysisData Base Design.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Software through PicturesandM;As UNIX continues to gain in popularity with desktop computer users (fueledin large measure by the Intel 386 chip), many programmers will beinvestigating UNIX-based CASE tools.andP;  What they will find is that unlike theDOS world, most UNIX-based CASE tools are oriented toward military andembedded systems development and usually priced in the high four-figurerange.andP;  The migration of DOS users to UNIX will pressure vendors to provideCASE products at a price desktop computer users can afford.andM;Software through Pictures (StP) from Interactive Development Environments(IDE) of San Francisco, Calif., is one of the best CASE tools available onany platform.andP;  However, StP is available only for UNIX-based workstations,including those offered by Sun, Apollo, DEC, and Hewlett-Packard.andP;  For thisreview, I installed StP on a Sun-4.andM;StP is designed to assist systems analysts and database designers in theinitial and intermediate stages of the waterfall model of the software lifecycle, including analysis and design.andP;  In particular, StP supports theYourdon-DeMarco data flow diagram (DFD) notation technique as well as themethods developed by Chris Gane and Trish Sarson.andP;  For the data modeler, StPsupports entity-relationship diagram (ERD) notation, BackusNaur Form (BNF)notation, and Michael Jackson-data structures.andM;Although database schemas for various relational database systems may begenerated, no code generation, simulation, or reverse-engineering facilitiesare provided.andP;  IDE has announced, however, that work on several new facilities is almost complete and will be announced before the end of 1989.andP;  Theobjective--as with many other CASE vendors--is to supply full life-cyclesupport.andP;  In addition, products that will support the emerging discipline ofobject-oriented structured design will eventually be supported.andM;If yopu like UNIX, you will appreciate how IDE has constructed StP: verymodular, completely open, fully documented, and extremely powerful.andP;  If youdon't like UNIX, you can still appreciate (and use) the tools from thegraphical environment.andP;  IDE belongs to the X-Windows Consortium: as variousplatforms are provided with X-Windows capabilities, IDE will be able to portStP to those platforms.andP;  For a variety of reasons (some based on marketingconsiderations and others based on ideological ones), IDE is focusing on thehigh-end workstation marketplace--as its price illustrates.andM;Since I do most of my CASE product work in the DOS environment, and much ofmy other work in a character-based UNIX environment, working with StP was atreat--one reason is the allure of that huge, clear screen on the Sunworkstation.andP;  In addition, I was frequently reminded that this machine hadmuch more power than a PC.andP;  Multitasking is de rigueur, and it was hard to goback to the DOS world after experiencing such power and elegance.andP;  It isparticularly difficult to return to a PC after experiencing thesophistication, elegance, and functionality of having multiple windows open,each containing a different analysis activity, as the screen display inFigure 1 illustrates.andM;StP, as I mentioned before, is a modular product.andP;  Included with the basicStP package is a collection of editors to automate the process of structureanalysis.andP;  These editors include the data flow diagram editor (DFE), theentity relationship editor (ERE), the data structure editor (DSE), and thestructure chart editor (SCE).andP;  IDE offers three optional editors--the controlspecification editor, the control flow editor, and the state transitioneditor--to extend StP for development of real-time systems using theHatley-Pirbhai extensions to the Yourdon-DeMarco notation.andM;The DFE supports both the Yourdon-DeMarco and the Gane-Sarson notations forDFDs.andP;  An interesting feature of the DFE is that the same diagram can bedrawn in either Yourdon-DeMarco or Gane-Sarson notation, regardless of themethod used to draw it originally.andP;  Thus the same diagram could be worked onby two different analysts using different methods.andP;  The drawing area providedfor DFDs is large enough to accommodate approximately 10 processes; however,this limitation, like virtually every other limitation, is a reflection ofthe default configurations supplied with StP.andP;  StP provides few limitationsother than those imposed by the hardware.andM;An outstanding feature of the DFE is that you are not required to begin aproject at the top level and decompose the various processes intosubprocesses.andP;  This feature may seem like a strange thing to get excitedabout, but if you have read Essential Systems Analysis by Stephen McMenaminand John Palmer (Yourdon Press, 1984), which describes a method of reducing asystem to its essential activities through a process involving eventpartitioning, you will immediately recognize the value of this feature.andP;  (Ifyou haven't read Essential Systems Analysis and you are involved in muchstructured analysis, you should definitely put this book on your must-readlist.)andM;The DFE allows you to partially automate the generation of minispecs via auser-definable template that picks up various variables from the graphicaleditor and the StP environment and places them on the minispec as desired.andO;Naturally, the analyst needs to complete the minispec with a description ofwhat the process does, but the bulk of the documentation effort is automated.andM;DFDs may be documented as elaborately as desired: you need not complete a DFDbefore decomposing it or gathering it into an essential activity.andP;  Althoughcomplete tools for checking for DFD integrity are available, you can callthem whenever you wish; you are never required to fully balance a DFD at anytime.andM;All information generated for DFDs is stored in the central repository ofStP: the data dictionary.andP;  IDE has developed a proprietary databasemanagement system called Troll that is used for managing all of the dataabout a project, including the data dictionary.andP;  Again, as with all other StPtools, the structure of Troll databases is completely open and fullydocumented.andP;  Several predefined reports and numerous tools for accessing aTroll database are provided.andM;Some analysts prefer to begin designing a system by documenting the datastructures.andP;  StP supports data-modeling activity with three different ways ofviewing the data.andP;  The first, probably most familiar to American programmers,is the ERD.andP;  Although ERDs can be drawn several ways, the one StP supports isthe one defined by Chen in 1976.andM;Other analysts prefer Jackson's hierarchial data structure diagrammingnotation.andP;  IDE has thoughtfully provided an alternative to data modelingusing ERDs: using the DSE, you may decompose data flows found on DFDs; allrelevant information is stored in the data dictionary.andM;When your ERDs or Jackson data structures are complete, you have the optionof generating schemas for various DBMSs from different vendors including DB2,Informix, Ingres, Oracle, Interbase, Sybase (SQL), and data structuredefinitions for various programming languages including C, Pascal, and Ada.andO;Additionally, data modeled with either the ERE or the DSE may be representedin BNF.andM;Rounding out the selection of graphical editors is the SCE, which providesthe programmer with the tools to create structure charts in the formdescribed by Larry Constantine (Yourdon and Constantine, Structured Design,Prentice-Hall, 1979).andP;  The structure charts are integrated into the datadictionary like the other StP tools, and can generate templates for modulesin various programming languages.andP;  However, this facility is quite primitiveand only documents the relationships among the various modules.andM;As I already mentioned, the data dictionary is built on the Troll DBMS IDEdeveloped.andP;  Significantly, any entity defined in any of the graphical editorsmay be referenced via the data dictionary.andP;  This feature provides aconsistent naming scheme, ensuring that all entities use the same names ineach environment.andM;Two recurring themes I have attempted to develop while describing StP areextensibility and configurability.andP;  IDE calls the glue that the userconfigures to meet unique requirements the Visible Connections architecture,which makes all interfaces to the tools visible.andP;  Virtually every aspect ofStP is user-configurable -- so configurable that if you don't know whatyou're doing you can dig yourself into a very deep hole.andP;  And if you findthat a particular tool's operation or functionality doesn't quite meet yourneeds, the published interfaces to virtually every aspect of StP makes iteasy to create your own tools, which can be integrated into the StPenvironment.andM;Installation of StP is very straightforward and poses no problems.andP;  Followingthe recommended procedure, I created a login for IDE and established the Cshell as the default shell.andP;  Then, using the UNIX tar utility, I extractedthe files from the tape to my home directory.andP;  Finally, I executed theinstall program, which created various subdirectories and moved theappropriate files to them.andP;  Although the locations and names of thesesubdirectories are user definable, I accepted IDE's default suggestions.andP;  Theinstall program concludes with a variety of questions regarding outputdevices and formatting programs (for example, whether UNIX troff/pic orPostScript will be used).andM;The software may be installed on another workstation or server from yourworkstation, for use by any workstation on the network.andP;  One reason StP isonly available on UNIX workstations is IDE firmly believes that softwareengineering should be a group activity--one that requires sophisticatedmultiple-workstation support.andM;Software through Pictures is a large, complex, expensive, impressive piece ofwork.andP;  Few CASE environments come close to what IDE provides for the systemsanalyst.andP;  But although IDE has done an admirable job automating the earlystages of software development, much work remains to support the latterstages of the life cycle.andP;  Specifically, code generation and prototypingfacilities are weak, and StP lacks reverse-engineering capacity andconfiguration management capabilities.andP;  However, given IDE's impressive trackrecord, I'm sure many of these needs will be addressed in the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
