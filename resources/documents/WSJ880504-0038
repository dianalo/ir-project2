The allegations were part of an otherwise routine motion made here for discovery in a broader case regarding financial disclosure.    Shearson, a unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., holds a 46% active equity stake in BNS Inc., the Beazer-led group that has made a $1.69 billion, or $60-a-share, bid for Koppers.    A Shearson spokesman vigorously denied the allegations made by Koppers. &quot;This amounts to a diversionary tactic,&quot; he said. &quot;The allegations raised are totally groundless.&quot;    The motion calls attention to Koppers shares traded by Shearson brokers and E.F. Hutton brokers. (Shearson and Hutton officially merged last week.) According to the motion, E.F. Hutton sold a net of nearly 154,710 Koppers shares from various brokerage accounts and Shearson sold a net of 2,270 shares from its discretionary accounts. By contrast, Koppers said, Shearson bought a net of 139,895 shares for its managed discretionary accounts, in which clients set strict parameters for the buying and selling of their stock.    These transactions, which Koppers said were revealed in court filings made by Shearson, were made from January through March 2, the day before BNS launched its offer.    According to the Koppers motion, the stock bought by Shearson included 115,460 shares purchased just two days before the tender offer was announced.    In the case of E.F. Hutton, the motion says, there is &quot;a clear pattern of moving Koppers shares out of those accounts, particularly in the weeks preceding the tender offer. The customers fortunate enough to be in Shearson's managed discretionary accounts, however, received a far different treatment. . . .    &quot;The data suggests . . . the purposeful use of inside information to benefit selected Shearson customers.&quot;    Yesterday's motion by Koppers, a construction materials and chemicals concern, is part of a larger defensive strategy in which Beazer, a British builder, has essentially been tied up in legal knots. Koppers, in fact, has won two preliminary injunctions -- one in the case here and one on antitrust grounds in Los Angeles -- indefinitely stopping completion of the bid.    BNS, meanwhile, has received valid tenders for about 66% of Koppers outstanding common shares. Still, almost every week, more paperwork is submitted by Koppers, alleging various violations of court orders and other offenses by BNS.    A source close to Koppers said yesterday's filing was the most serious. &quot;If you have some customers getting preferential treatment,&quot; he said. &quot;it doesn't make for a very open marketplace.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
