Traces of the drug clomipramine, known by the trade nameAnafrail, turned up in autopsy tests on Laurie Dann's body, CookCounty Medical Examiner Robert Stein said Wednesday. He said thetests showed no traces of any other drug.   Anafrail can cause suicidal tendencies in some patients who takeit, Dr. Robert DeVito, a pyschiatrist at Loyola University MedicalCenter in suburban Maywood, said Thursday.   DeVito, in an interview with WMAQ-TV, said he didn't think thedrug would have caused Ms. Dann to go on the shooting spree.   Dr. John Griest, a Madison, Wis., psychiatrist treating Ms.Dann, was involved in tests of Anafrail at a University ofWisconsin clinic, said Gloria Martini, a spokeswoman for Ciba-GeigyCorp., the New Jersey maker of the drug.   Griest cannot comment on Ms. Dann's case under theconfidentiality of doctor-patient relationships, said Lauren Cnare,a spokesman at the Madison clinic. But Ms. Cnare said, ``We areinvolved in clinical trials of Anafrail.''   On May 20, Ms. Dann, 30, walked into the Hubbard WoodsElementary School in Winnetka, north of Chicago, shot a boy in thebathroom and then entered a classroom and shot five otheryoungsters.   She fled the school and entered a nearby home, where she woundeda 20-year-old man who tried to seize the gun, then killed herselfas police surrounded the house.   Ms. Cnare said the drug, which has been used in other countriesfor two decades, is being tested in the United States to treat``obsessive-compulsive disorder,'' which occurs in about 1 percentof the population.   People suffering from the disorder have repeated unpleasantthoughts or impulses as well as repetitive behavior, Ms. Cnare said.   ``Carried to the extreme, some people spend eight hours in theshower,'' Ms. Martini said. The drug also is used to check``repetitive thoughts of random violence,'' she added.   Ms. Dann had exhibited various symptoms of the disorder.Residents of an apartment complex in Madison where she once livedsaid she often rode the elevator for hours.   Ms. Cnare said the University of Wisconsin has been involvedwith clinical trials of Anafrail since September 1986. So far, shesaid, 32 adults and 30 children have been given the drug.   The clinical tests are being conducted, with governmentapproval, at 21 centers around the country.</TEXT></DOC>
