Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta tested the blood of165 people who had tested negative for the human immunodeficiencyvirus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, and found that 30 actually wereinfected with the virus.   Dr. Tab Ansari, the Emory professor who supervised the study,said Tuesday that his team used a new type of test to find HIVantibodies in blood samples that the routine laboratory tests hadsaid were disease-free.   ``All of the ones that they found positive, we found positive inour assay,'' said Ansari. ``But in addition, there were quite a fewthat were negative in their assay that were picked up as positivein our assay.''</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Pennsylvania voters set the stage for an unusual governor's racebetween an anti-abortion Democrat _ Gov.

Nuclear warheads, suggests the American Institute of Aeronauticsand Astronautics, may be needed to protect the planet againstmountain-sized space boulders that might smash into the Earth at46,000 miles an hour.   ``We have the technology needed to detect and track such anobject and possibly to divert it from an impending impact,'' theAIAA said. ``We would be derelict if we did nothing.''   In a position paper, the society suggested that searches of theheavens be increased, perhaps by spotting relatively inexpensivetelescopes around the globe. It also called for a study of ways to``deflect or destroy, or significantly alter the orbits of,asteroids predicted to impact the Earth.''</TEXT></DOC>
