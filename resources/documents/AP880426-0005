The influx of Vietnamese refugees began in 1975 after U.S.forces withdrew from South Vietnam and it fell to communist forcesfrom North Vietnam.   Of the 226,091 refugees, 217,812 resettled in other countries,including 128,000 in the United States, said Eric E. Morris, theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for Malaysia andBrunei.   In the first three months of this year, 2,921 boat peoplereached Malaysian shores, higher than the 1,702 for the same periodlast year, he said.   Morris told reporters the increase was due, in part, toThailand's decision to forbid boats of refugees to land on itsshores.
