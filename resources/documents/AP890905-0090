An official announcement said a top level security conferencepresided over by Interior Minister Christodoulos Veniamin ``decidedon taking a series of measures aimed at the further strengthening ofinternal security and preventing criminal activities in Cyprus.''   Witnesses have reported more frequent foot and mobile patrols byparamilitary police at the island's two civil airports, at Larnacaon the south coast and at Paphos on the west.   Extra security also has been mounted at other sensitive spots,including major foreign diplomatic missions.   The increased security also is believed to be linked to thetransit through Larnaca airport in the past week of several heads ofstate en route to the summit conference of the non-aligned movementin Belgrade. The same leaders will be passing through the airport ontheir way home at the end of the week.   The additional security follows two serious terrorist incidentson the island in the past two months.   Six Lebanese Moslems armed with a shoulder-fired anti-aircraftmissile launcher were arrested near Larnaca airport in July. Theyconfessed they had arrived on the island to shoot down thehelicopter of Christian Lebanese leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who hadbeen expected at the airport.   Authorities fear that other Lebanese terrorists may attempt anaircraft hijack or some other operation to demand the release of thesix Lebanese who are awaiting trial.   In the other incident, late in August, an Iranian Kurdish leaderwas shot to death and another Iranian was critically wounded inLarnaca by two unknown assailants.   It was the first such incident involving Iranians on the island,which has been frequently caught in the cross fire of Middle Eastrivalries like the Arab-Israeli conflict or other inter-Arab feuds.</TEXT></DOC>
