(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A spill at a Shell Oil Co. refinery hasleft dozens of birds and marsh animals coated with crude oil duringnesting season in the wildlife haven of the Suisun Bay marshland.   By Monday, about 100 oiled birds _ including egrets, avocets,cinnamon teals, mallard ducks, grebes, herons and endangeredclapper rail birds _ had been rescued and taken to centers inBerkeley and Walnut Creek for cleaning, said Brian Hunter, of thestate Department of Fish and Game.   In another California oil industry development, a federal judgehas decided that local ordinances did not violate federalregulations in a ruling that threw out 10 of 13 oil industry claimsagainst cities and counties attempting to control offshore drilling.   The birds were trapped after 21,000 gallons of thick, unrefinedcrude gushed Saturday from Martinez' Shell Refinery holding tank,30 miles northeast of San Francisco.   The oil coats the birds' feathers, leaving them unable to keepwarm or move around.   Also threatened are the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse andsuch marsh creatures as tortoises, muskrats and otters. Volunteershave reported a dozen dead muskrats, several oil-coated turtles anda dead heron.   State officials said Monday they planned to sacrifice a sectionof Suisun Bay marshland in order to save hundreds more acres ofwetlands.   ``We're trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled,'' saidHunter.   By Monday, a slick stretched 10 miles from Port Costa east toRyer Island.   Six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 vacuum tank-trucks weresent to capture oil but Coast Guard spokesman Ken Massey estimatedit could take until next week to clean up the oil.   Shell said it traced the spill to a damaged drain on a tank onthe west side of Interstate 680.   Massey said Shell will have to pay for the damage, including newpaint for the bottoms of hundreds of pleasure boats.   In the offshore drilling case, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B.Marshall ruled in Los Angeles that in 10 cases the local ordinancesdid not challenge federal supremacy as the oil industry had claimed.   The judge, in a decision made public Monday, said furtherexamination of the evidence was necessary to determine ifordinances in three areas might violate the commerce clause of theConstitution.   The Western Oil and Gas Association and National OceanIndustries Association filed suit last August.   Western Oil contended in the suit that the local ordinanceswould ``create a wall from the Mexican border to the Oregon stateline blocking development of oil in the outer continental shelf.''Development would be hindered by severe restrictions on onshoresupport facilities such as pipelines and processing plants,according to the suit.   But the judge ruled the ordinances are not true obstacles tocommerce.   ``By implication, the judge has recognized the local governmentshave good reason to be concerned about the impacts and effectsonshore facilities can have on the quality of their environments,''said Johanna Wald, attorney for the San Francisco-based NaturalResources Defense Council, which helped fight the claim.   Western Oil spokesman Robert Getts said he didn't know if thetwo associations would appeal the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
