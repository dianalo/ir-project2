 Thehigh-end 33-MHz system, once confined to a role as departmentalfile server, is now enjoying considerable success in the personalcomputer market.andP;  Detailed is a buyer's guide to the featuresavailable on a 33-MHz Intel 80386-based microcomputer in today'smarket, including the top of the line, the slim design of desktopcases, tower systems, using memory cache to speed up a system,expansion capabilities, and using Microsoft Windows 3.0.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Intel 80386 (Microprocessor) (Usage).andO;Topic:     TutorialHardware SelectionMicrocomputers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Once the status power machine of the well-to-do, or the blazing file serverfor a company's local area network, the 33MHz 386 has come down dramaticallyin price, but not, surprising, in statuture.andP;  The fact remains that althoughthe 486 is a faster and somewhat more efficient processing chip, there isnothing the 486 can do that the 386 cannot.andP;  And by moving from thehigh-priced, high-end workstation and server market, the 386 is creating asecond stir of excitement as it becomes a powerful yet relatively inexpensivemainstream machine for the business user.andM;The 386 you see on the market today has not only survived the test of time,it boasts a wealth of cutting-edge design and performance enhancements notfound in earlier models.andP;  These enhancements include smaller and fastercomponents, reduced chip sets, efficiently downsized motherboards, andhigh-speed caching schemes.andP;  Some models have on-board Super VGA graphics andupgradeable processors, and may come bundled with extras like Windows 3.0,diagnostic software, a mouse, toll-free technical support, and next-day oronsite repair.andP;  Many of these systems, even those most fully stocked, maycost as little as $3,000 through the mail.andM;Top of the LineandM;The 33MHz 386 is one of the hottest systems on the market.andP;  With muscularprocessing power and affordable mail-order prices, it's hard to find a biggerbang for your PC-purchasing buck.andP;  You can expect roughly a 32 percentincrease in performance going from a 25MHz system to an equally configured33MHz machine.andP;  Yet the faster computer costs only $200 to $400 more onaverage.andP;  Clearly, the price/performance advantage belongs to the 33MHzcomputer.andM;The 33MHz is the top of Intel's 386 line of ultimate 32-bit processing chips.andO;It was originally utilized only by top brand-name manufacturers who targetedsophisticated, high-end users.andP;  But as time has passed, improvements in 386technology along with a greater availability of chip sets and theirdiminishing costs have opened up the market for the 386.andP;  Mail-ordercompanies can now design, produce, and market systems as technicallyefficient as--and sometimes even superior to--Compaq and IBM at a fraction ofthose vendors' costs.andP;  In fact, rather than move away from the 386, recentdevelopments like the new release of a 40MHz 386 processor by Intel'scompetitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) illustrate the staying power of the386 chip.andP;  (See the sidebar, &quot;AMD Challenges Intel.&quot;)andM;The net result of these changes is a market brimming with choices.andP;  There hasnever been a better time to snap up a power machine loaded with extras forbetween $2,300 abd $4,500.andP;  But because of all the choices you have, thinkthrough your buying decision carefully.andP;  As you compare models, you mightbreak down a machine's characteristics into a few key categories such assize, components, expansion, upgradeability, and service and support.andM;Slim Is InandM;The efficient new motherboards found in the 386 family mean a greaterassortment of shapes and sizes from which to choose.andP;  While most are stillavailable in conventional full-size desktop cases, some of the hottest newmachines are barely bigger than a VCR.andP;  Half-height small-footprint cases(known as slimlines) measure a scant 4 by 15 by 16 inches (HWD) on average,and are ideal for those who want the power, but can't spare the space.andO;Slimlines are also lightweight--at 15 pounds, these units can easily betucked away or moved without much effort.andM;The secret to the smaller cases is in the motherboards.andP;  Thanks toinnovations in design, the latest generation of motherboards are not onlyhalf the size of their mothers before them--some also provide on-board video,I/O ports, and a hard drive controller or IDE pass-through and floppy diskdrive controller without the need for add-in expansion cards.andM;The slim-style cases may be more aesthetically pleasing, but reclaiming somedesktop real estate usually means giving up a little space inside the PC.andO;Slim cases usually offer about half the expansion room of their full-size bigbrothers.andP;  If expansion is anticipated, you should probably conider a 33MHz386 that resides in a larger box.andM;Slimlines usually offer three 16-bit ISA slots and three bay cavities, andsome provide an additional three 8-bit slots.andP;  While a six-slot unit willsuit most users, three drive bays can pose a problem--especially since astandard two-floppy, one-hard-drive configuration instantly uses up theavailable bays.andP;  Of course, there are ways around the limitation.andP;  You canbuy external versions of components like tape backups, or hard cards insteadof another hard drive, but limited bays are the Achilles' heel of theseunits.andM;Nonetheless, slimline machines are no doubt the most elegant way to computeas long as you can manage to stay within three bays and three 16-bit slotsmaximum.andM;Power TowersandM;Greater diversity in shape also caters to the 386 destined for rigorousworkstation and network server duty.andP;  Upright tower cases were designed formaximum expansion and sturdy, industrial performance.andP;  Some tower units offeras many as eight or nine drive bays, and eight expansion slots.andM;Smaller tower units are ideal for floor storage.andP;  They won't tip as easily,and if the floppy drives are set in true upright-tower fashion--that is,horizontally--you won't have to fumble around when putting in a disk.andP;  Babytowers are meant more for desktop use, and are more cosmetically tower-likethan in the true expansion sense of the word.andP;  However, a baby tower doesoffer the smallest footprint of all, so you may want to give one a secondlook if the slimlines seem too limiting.andP;  Baby towers can vary in terms ofdrive bays and expansion slots--falling somewhere between a regular desktopcase and a slimline.andM;Though the internal operations of a 386-33 processor are inherently fast,overall performance can be compromised if the computer system is loaded withthe wrong components.andM;Install a video board with a poorly written BIOS or less-than-efficient chipset, and video performance starts a domino effect that affects performanceacross the system.andP;  And if a video board is light on memory, it can restrictyour use of colors on the screen or force you into a lower refresh rate thatincreases screen flicker.andM;Many of the machines sold today come with VGA graphics included.andP;  Dependingon the motherboard design, some systems are starting to offer on-board SuperVGA, although this is truer of slimlines than full-size systems.andP;  On-boardVGA usually comes with 256K of video memory, but tends to go no farther than512K.andP;  As most Super VGA cards now offer memory up to 1MB, you may findyourself disabling the on-board video for a better adapter.andP;  One megabytewill accommodate 256 colors, while in most cases, 512K limits you to only 16simultaneous on-screen colors.andM;If you have particular graphics requirements, always check the adaptersincluded with a system, and the other video options the company offers.andO;While most adapters will work with older or lower resolution monitors, theyhave a ceiling in terms of maximum resolution which you monitor many surpass.andM;Today, many people are migrating to Super VGA, which provides a resolution of800 by 600 non-interlaced, and crisp graphics for applications such asdesk-top publishing, drawing packages, and Windows.andP;  (For more detailed videoand adapter information, see the June, 1991, PC Sources Hardware Buyer'sGuide.)andM;Since the bus in a 386 33MHz computer is the same size as in an 8MHz 286, IDEand ESDI drives usually have buffered controllers to help the slow ISA buskeep from being overrun by the faster data transfer speed.andP;  This bufferedspace typically runs anywhere from 32K to 64K.andP;  The hard drive itself shouldhave an average access time of 25ms or faster, or it will start to addoverhead that can adversely affect the system's performance.andP;  Most IDEdrives, as in the machines profiled in this buyer's guide, run faster than20ms.andM;While system performance won't be affected by the keyboard, a mushy orespecially clicky set of keys can hamper your productivity, and even yourenjoyment of your new system.andP;  But don't turn away from an otherwisesuperlative system because you hate the keyboard.andP;  Unless the system has anon-standard connection, you can replace the keyboard with one you likebetter for under $100.andM;And there are more specialty keyboards from which to choose now.andP;  Some areeven programmable, so that users of the same system can load custom-designedkey layouts from the keyboard's memory each time they use the machine.andP;  Inaddition, specialty keyboards provide user-specified macro keys.andP;  XT and ATrows of function keys, and even electronic calculators.andM;Turbo Charge Your SystemandM;Even with fast components, the performance of a 386-33 can be boosted withthe addition of a small amount of highspeed spetic RAM cache.andP;  RAM cache actsas a freeway between the processor and the slower system memory.andO;Essentially, for a 33MHz computer to operate at the desired and frequentlyadvertised zero-wait states, the processor must access the memory chips every33 nanoseconds.andP;  Unfortunately, only very expensive SRAM chips can perform atthat speed, so designers have had to turn to slow but inexpensive 60ns to80ns dynamic RAM chips to keep down system costs.andM;By adding 32K to 128K of RAM cache, the system can achieve a memory hit rateof 90 percent or better, and run at nearly zero wait states.andP;  RAM cache helpsa system operate with a much better match between processing speed and systemmemory.andP;  And you can do this for only an extra $100 or so.andP;  (For a morespecific look at what cache size is right for you and what not opting forcache means to performance, see the sidebar, &quot;Processor RAM Cache: Hype orHelp?&quot;)andM;Overall, processor RAM cache will improve a system's performance.andP;  Anotherway to jack up overall system performance is shadowing.andP;  This occursautomatically after bootup as the system BIOS and video BIOS are copied intoa small segment of RAM--which is faster than ROM.andP;  Make sure, however, thatthe BIOS comes with some method of disabling the shadowing feature--asshadowing can sometimes conflict with certain applications, such as Windowsor any other program that uses protected-mode memory.andM;You can enhance performance further by adding a coprocessor.andP;  But that willonly help if you perform extensive financial calculations or use CAD programsand, more importantly, those applications that support a coprocessor.andP;  (For adetailed look into math coprocessors and their costs, manufacturers, andbenefits, see the sidebar, &quot;Do You Need a Coprocessor?&quot;)andM;ExpansionandM;Even if you've paid careful attention to getting the right configuration andcomponents to maintain optimal performance, it's likely you'll have to add toyour system in one way or another over time.andP;  One of the first additionsyou'll probably make is more RAM.andP;  Software requirements are continuallygrowing, particularly in the Windows environment.andP;  But, with a range of 16MBto 64MB of installable RAM in tbe systems profiled here, expansion shouldnever be a problem, even with operating systems like UNIX.andM;Most systems use 1MB single-in-line memory modules (SIMMs), but many nowsupport 4MB SIMMs, and a rare few are starting to install them in standardconfigurations.andP;  SIMMs are easy to obtain, inexpensive, and much simpler toinstall than individual chips.andP;  They just click into specially designedconnecting racks on the motherboard.andP;  The process is similar to installing anexpansion card, except that a SIMM is only a couple of inches long.andP;  (See theApplications Focus, &quot;Upgrade Features.&quot;)andM;With DRAM prices at an affordable level, there is no reason to settle forfewer than 4MB of system RAM--especially if you're using Windows, a number ofTSRs, or want to use software disk caching.andP;  Generally, two megabytes willget you through most applications, including Windows, if you're not doinglarge spread-sheet-type work or trying to run a great many applications atonce.andP;  (See the sidebar, &quot;Making Do with Less.&quot;)andM;Another common way you might add to your system is with expansion cards.andO;They may come in the form of a modem, tape backup controller, CD-ROMcontroller, etc.andP;  Most 386 33MHz computers offer a mix of ISA slots toaccommodate these expansion cards.andP;  An average configuration might be two8-bit, four 16-bit, and one 32-bit slot.andP;  Currently, 16-bit slots are themost desirable--as they will accept 8-bit boards as well as 16-bit adapters.andO;Slimlines tend to offer only three 16-bit slots, or three 16-and three 8-bitslots.andP;  In the case of ISA systems, a 32-bit slot can just be used for avendor's special memory board or other proprietary enhancements.andM;Drive bays ive you the chance to build up your storage capacity.andP;  Withfull-height, half-height, and 3.5-inch sizes from which to choose, a typicalmix usually includes three half-height external bays and two half-heightinternals, with 3.5-inch options finding their way into the smallestmachines.andP;  Generally, slimlines are full if you opt for two floppy drives andone hard drive.andP;  The size of the case usually determines the number ofpossible drives.andP;  Machines slated as network servers are usually bought inlarge tower cases, with individual needs dictating the desktop case sizes.andM;Keeping Options OpenandM;The ultimate addition to your system is a new motherboard or an upgradedprocessor card.andP;  But you can generally change the motherboard only inmachines that are built to be upgraded.andM;The motherboards in upgradeable machines are usually designed with aproprietary upgrade slot placed somewhere near the 386 processor chip.andP;  Oryou might find a small plug-in processor board that sits above the 386socket.andP;  When you decide to upgrade, you either inset the new processor cardand tighten a few screws, or pull out the chip and place the smaller board ontop.andP;  Some companies offer rebates on the old processor, which requirescarefully removing the 386 chip from the socket and mailing it in to themanufacturer for a refund.andP;  Upgrading to a 33MHz 486 costs between $900 to$2,600 for the upgrade card--significantly lower than the cost of a newmachine at today's prices.andM;Another design innovation is the generic motherboard.andP;  This lets themanufacturer create one motherboard for a wide range of processors.andP;  Byplacing a tiny processor platform over a generic socket on the motherboard,the platform, not the motherboard, determines the specific model.andP;  This letsthe manufacturer produce more precise quantities of platfors at a lower cost,creating a more efficient manufacturing process--one that should translate tolower-priced machines.andM;Upgradeable machines are hot items right now.andP;  Since technology changes atsuch a lightening-fast pace, many companies have found themselves insituations where the technology ages faster than depreciation schedules.andP;  Anupgradeable machine is one way to stay up to date, although some upgradecards are so expensive that they out-price brand-new systems.andP;  (For a closerlook at the pros and cons of this issue, see the sidebar,&quot;Point/Counterpoint: Upgradeable Systems.&quot;)andM;Doing WindowsandM;Some of the reasons for upgrading your system center on the incrediblepopularity of Windows 3.0.andP;  This is also a good rationale for buying a 33MHzsystem in the first place.andP;  Windows is notoriously slow, so the faster yourprocessor, the better off you are.andP;  In 386 enhanced mode, Windows comes alivewith speed, and combined with a Super VGA monitor and 2MB to 4MB of RAM,running Windows can be a viable alternative to DOS.andM;Vendors are responding to the mass movement to Windows by offering attractiveWindows/DOS bundles.andP;  Some will throw in a mouse with the package, and thelatest selling promotion is to pre-install Windows and DOS for you, so thatsetup is truly plug-and-go.andP;  As a rule of thumb, always double-check the costfor &quot;free&quot; services or preinstallation options.andP;  A vendor that charges $100to install DOS on your hard drive, for example, is not offering much of aservice.andM;DocumentationandM;Another service that tends to be overlooked is documentation.andP;  Even if youregularly work under the hood of your computer, it pays to insist on gooddocumentation for every unit you buy.andP;  In addition to being a printed sourcefor basic computing information, a good set of manuals should offer completediagrams of your system's layout, a solid section on upgrades andtroubleshooting, and maintenance tips and suggestions for your particularmachine.andP;  And if the vendor bundles other programs, the proper manuals shouldaccompany each piece of software as well.andM;For those who like having manuals, but never seem to read them, somemanufacturers are starting to attach full system diagrams directly inside thecase--usually on the underside of the cover.andP;  This can be a helpful way toquickly locate something without breaking out the documentation.andP;  Othermanuals take a more visual approach by using actual photographs of themachine.andP;  Manufacturers are also getting better about labeling ports andsometimes even areas of the motherboard to facilitate setup.andM;In addition to instructional material, there should be a printed warrantyincluded somewhere in your documentation package.andP;  Warranties are usuallyprinted on cardboard stock, but can just as often be found printed on theback of invoices or packing slips.andP;  (See &quot;Paper Trail: What Your Mail-OrderInvoice Tells You,&quot; in the March, 1991, PC Sources.)andM;Always ask the vendor to describe not only the terms of the warranty, butwhat it looks like and where it will be fulfilled.andM;Buying by MailandM;Although there is a difference between ordering a $40 piece of software and a$3,500 system, the mail-order channel is really geared to selling systemswith a variety of hard-to-beat policies, prices, and quality assuranceprograms.andP;  If you insist on a few key policies, and take the time to examinewarranty and repair programs, you should have no trouble locating anexcellent buy and a wealth of services.andM;Even before you buy, make sure the system you're considering has a proper FCCcertification.andP;  If the computer is to be used in a home, it must have theClass B rating, which calls for especially low radio-frequency emissions.andP;  Ifthe computer is going to be used in an office or industrial setting, it onlyneeds to have a Class A rating, which is somewhat more lenient with theamount of radio emissions.andP;  (With the growing trend toward wireless LANs,that leniency may change over time.)andP;  Even so, home or office, it's toeveryone's benefit to insist on true Class B machines.andP;  You can confirm asystem's Class B certification by locating the FCC sticker on the back of theunit when it arrives.andM;Another thing on which to insist before buying is a 30-day,no-questions-asked return policy.andP;  Thirty days gives you the time to exploreevery aspect of your new system for any flaws or disappointments withoutpaying more than the return freight.andM;There is no greater safety net than this policy, and some vendors arestretching their guarantees to 60 days--though usually at slightly higherprices.andP;  As long as you return the system in its original packaging, and havenot destroyed or defaced the documentation, the trial run is a low-costinsurance policy.andM;Service and SupportandM;In such a competitive arena, vendors often use outstanding service andsupport policies as a way to break ahead of the crowd.andP;  In fact, traditionalstorefront dealers can no longer compete with the level of technical supportoffered as a toll-free service to most mail-order customers.andP;  A toll-freephone call is actually the fastest way to resolve the majority of systemproblems and questions.andP;  Some companies have developed customer databases sothat a detailed account of your call and problem can be recorded and kept asa sort of medical record for your machine.andM;When a repair is necessary, you may have the choice of on-site service ormailing back the unit of repair.andP;  Most mail-order companies offer mail-backrepair services, although some offer a combination of the two--whereby thecompany will mail a part and try to talk you through the repair, opting tosend in a technician or have you ship back the unit if the attempt wasunsuccessful.andP;  In most cases, technical problems including repairs can behandled with a good phone technician.andM;On-site service is largely a matter of preference, and its usefulness candepend on the company licensed to do the job.andP;  Whether you automatically geton-site service with your system or buy it as an option, you should press thevendor for a guarantee on turnaround time.andP;  Sometimes, when a vendor says itoffers on-site service, it will send service at its discretion.andP;  This meansit may be a last resort exercised only after other considerable efforts.andP;  Andalways check into the company that services the on-site policy, if it's athird party.andM;If you agree to a mail-back repair policy, check to see if you will have tofirst mail back defective parts before receiving new ones.andP;  Some companieswill send out a new part and then give you 30 days to return the defectiveone.andP;  Try to get a commitment in writing for all aspects of repair, includingturnaround time and the shipping method.andP;  It always helps to ask the vendorto explain its complete repair process in detail.andP;  For instance, find out inadvance who pays for shipping, where the unit goes, and what must be doneprior to a repair.andM;A good vendor will also be committed to preventing system problems are wellas repairing them.andP;  In terms of preventative support, some companies offerfree diagnostic programs to keep your machine ahead of trouble, as well asinstructions for cleaning and caring for you unit.andP;  A copy of The NortonUtilities, PC Tools, or QAPlus is also a smart investment since thesepackages come with powerful utilities for troubleshooting, and repairingsystem and file-related problems.andM;The 386 remains a tremendously powerful machine.andP;  With so many options,performance enhancements, and storage and processing capacities, this is onesystem you won't see collecting dust anytime soon.andM;AMD CHALLENGES INTELandM;&quot;We have broken the Intel monopoly,&quot; proclaimed the announcement fromAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) on the day its Am386DX-40 became the first chipto break Intel's exclusive control of the 386 market.andP;  AMD's was also thefirst 386 chip to exceed the 33MHz speed barrier.andM;According to AMD, its pin-for-pin Intel-compatible chip, which runs at alightning-fast 40MHz, offers users a 21 percent performance boost over the33MHz 386.andP;  It does this for as little as $100 more than a comparableIntel-based 33MHz 80386 system.andM;To counter, Intel immediately released on affordable SX version of itsi486DX, sending a strong message to the public that a migration to 486processing was, in Intel's opinion, inevitable.andP;  (See the sidebar, &quot;IntelBrings Us Another SX Chip.&quot;)  To the buyers suddenly caught in the crossfire,this latest development further complicates buying decisions.andP;  Processor typeand processor-chip manufacturer are now factors to weigh before buying.andM;The confusion arises from the fact that although the 486 is abetter-implemented version of 386, there is nothing the 486 can do that the386 cannot.andP;  This was not true of the 286/386 transition, where there was agenuine and significant difference between a 16-bit platform and a true32-bit architecture.andM;The not-so-dramatic difference between the 386 and 486 may mean, according tosome analysts, that buyers will not migrate in droves to the 486--despiteIntel's prod.andP;  AMD is convinced that the 386 has plenty of life left, and theAm386DX-40 chip surfacing in more and more machines may be evidence that thepublic is not willing to let go of the 386 just yet.andM;The Am386DX-40 made its debut in mail-order systems from AresMicrodevelopment, Northgate, Peregrine, and Standard Computer--all companiesthat traditionally received Intel chips, but only after preferred customerslike Compaq are IBM were supplied first.andP;  The greater availability of AMDchips has strong appeal to smaller mail-order companies who typically bearthe brunt of Intel chip shortages.andM;With AMD now in the picture, mail-order companies committed to completesystem design have the first crack at new and unique chips.andP;  As a boon tobuyers, the added competition in the 386 market is likely to cause prices todrop, although both Intel and AMD claim that a 386 price war will not occur.andM;In any event, the combination of value and availability offered by the AMDchip makes it an attractive Intel alternative to developers and customersalike.andP;  And while the 486 will continue to gain strength in the networkserver and workstation markets, the AMD is one fast chip for buyersinterested in the 386.andM;INTEL BRINGS US ANOTHER SX CHIPandM;Is there a 486 in your future?andP;  Intel says yes, but after a new 386announcement and extremely affordable pricing in that market, many buyers arestopping to think twice.andM;Intel rolled out an SX version of its 486 chip this April in hopes of luringbuyers into the 486 market and away from the 386 arena.andP;  However, this wasconsidered to be more of a tactical move than a technical one.andP;  Intel's 486SXintroduction barely trailed emerging competitor Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD)recent unveiling of its 40MHz 386 chip--touted as the chip that broke Intel'scontrol of the 386 market.andP;  (See the sidebar, &quot;AMD Challenges Intel.&quot;)andM;Ever since, the issue is: Which chip manufacturer should be believe?andO;According to Intel, the 486SX is a true 486 processor with slightlyscaled-back features.andP;  The chip runs at a maximum of 20MHz, does not includethe built-in math coprocessor feature of the i486DX, but does provide thesame 8K high-speed SRAM cache built on the DX.andM;This makes the 486 family more appealing to a potentially wider segment ofbuyers--hopefully stretching the group on include more than the presenthighened workstation and server customers.andP;  To add even more incentive, Intelpriced its chip at a bulk cost roughly equal to 33MHz 80386.andM;AMD's argument has always been that the 486 at any price does not offer thecompelling incentive to switch--like the 386 did for 286 owners.andP;  Since boththe 486 and the 386 are 32-bit processors, the 486 is nothing more than asophisticated 386 with a built-in match coprocessor.andP;  Which, according toAMD, is not something to get excited about.andM;The success of Intel's 386SX chip was based on the disparities of a 16-bitplatform versus the 32-bit platform, the growing demand for popularapplications like Windows 3.0, and faster 32-bit processing.andP;  The 486SX isnot expected to achieve the same success precisely because it doesn't havethe dramatic contrast to chips like the Am386-40 and the 386 platform, ingeneral.andM;Intel has called AMD's latest move five years behind the times--the exact ageof 386 technology--and is quick to point out that AMD also developed and soldfaster 286 version long after Intel moved to the 386 platform.andP;  As allprocessors eventually sink to the most inexpensive entry level, Intel appearscontent to leave behind what may look like a vital and breathing technologyfor more of the high-end market.andM;So what's the determining factor is this tug of war?andP;  For the moment, it'sprice, since AMD's 386 chip and Intel's 486SX are estimated to be just aboutequal in terms of overall speed.andP;  In reality, overall pricing may influencebuyers for more than the heated arguments launched from both sides.andM;As buyer's increasingly demand the most processing muscle for their dollar,the chip that emerges better-suited and better-priced will probably prevail.andM;PROCESSOR RAM CACHE: HYPE OR HELP?andM;The 80386 computers in this review run at 33 million cycles (or operations)per second.andP;  That's how the 386 gets its 33MHz label.andP;  Dynamic random-accessmemory (DRAM), on the other hand, is rated for its access time, and thatnumber appears in nanoseconds, not megahertz.andP;  Unfortunately, when you'redesigning a computer, you need to try to match the speed of the processor andthe speed of the RAM.andM;Getting both devices on equal footing isn't really that difficult; it startsby finding the inverse of the processor's speed.andP;  If 33 million cycles occurin one second, each cycle takes 1/33 millionth of a second, or 30.0nanoseconds.andM;The majority of the computers in this buyer's guide use 80ns RAM devices, andthey are hardly a good match for a processor running at 30ns.andP;  The processorneeds to wait through more than two of its own cycles before memory cancomplete one of its own--and it gets worse.andP;  The access rating for DRAMdoesn't take into account its refresh or recharge time, which can raise theRAM's true access time by 50 to 100 percent.andM;The simplest answer is to use faster DRAM.andP;  For a 30ns processor, 15ns to25ns devices would work well if you could find them, but you can't.andP;  No onecurrently makes a DRAM chip that fast for your microcomputer.andP;  There isanother solution.andP;  It's called static random-access memory (SRAM).andP;  Thebenefit of SRAM chips is that they don't need to be refreshed.andP;  With the lossof the refresh overhead, 15ns SRAM chips would be excellent, but a 30nsprocessor could easily get by with 20ns to 25ns devices--and they areavailable.andP;  They're also very expensive.andP;  The cost of 128K of SRAM is aboutthe same as 1MB of DRAM, making it impractical for most of us load up acomputer with only SRAM chips.andM;The solution is a compromise between the problems of slow DRAM and costlySRAM, and it's called cache RAM.andP;  A small number of SRAM chips (currently,the field runs from 8K to 256K) is used to cache data coming from slow DRAMin the faster SRAM environment.andP;  Everyone agrees that cache works, but no onecan agree on how much is needed, not even the experts.andP;  For example, Inteldesigned its 80486 with 8K internal cache, and that must be the optimumamount, right?andP;  No, it doesn't appear to be.andP;  Intel also released aTurboCache chip that contains an external cache controller and, you guessedit, more cache RAM.andP;  So what's a person to do?andM;There's roughly a 10 percent difference between the best possible amount ofSRAM and the amount you most often find as the base cache SRAM in a computer.andO;That difference will still cost you more than $500.andP;  But if you want to getevery last ounce of performance from your system, it's money well spent.andO;Under most other conditions, however, save your money for a larger harddrive.andM;DO YOU NEED A COPROCESSOR?andM;The bad news is that an 80486-based computer will be faster than anequivalent 80386 computer--no matter what you do.andP;  Primarily affecting thedifference is the 486's internal cache RAM and built-in math coprocessor.andO;But there are other subtleties of design in the advanced chip and in thecomputers built around it that add to its speed.andM;The good news is that you can come very close to 486 power if you buildprocessor RAM cache into your 386, and toss in a math coprocessor.andP;  The cacheis easy.andP;  At 33MHz, you're hard-pressed to find a 386 that doesn't haveexternal cache.andP;  Math coprocessors, on the other hand, can be elusive.andM;It's not that there's a lack of them, either.andP;  Intel's own 80387 is incompany with Cyrix's 83D87 and EMC87 models, as well as IntegratedInformation Technologies' 3C87.andP;  All these chips are functional clones ofeach other to the extent that if your software is written to use the Intelchip, it will also work with the  ther three.andM;Naturally, each of the alternative manufacturers makes superior-performanceclaims over the Intel product.andP;  While the finer points of comparisons may beargued, the bottom line is this: With software written with the 387 in mind,there's little difference among chips.andP;  It's only if you're running softwarethat makes specific use of any of the features uniquely available in aspecific chip that you may see degress of difference.andM;The larger question is, what kind of work merits a coprocessor?andP;  If you'redoing mostly floating-point calculations, a math coprocessor is the only wayto go.andP;  But not every financial application incorporates floating math.andO;Spreadsheets certainly do not.andP;  Even the most complex future-valuedetermination is nothing more than a combination of additions andsubstractions.andM;Get into trigonometry or irrational numbers (engineers and scientistscalculating the laws of the universe, take note) and you begin to see some ofthe honest effects of the coprocessor.andP;  Keep in mind, however, that thecalculations themselves represent only a portion of the program's activities.andO;With drive, memory, and video usage, an application's actual performanceimprovement--incorporating a coprocessor--is hardly commensurate with mostvendors' claims.andM;Further complicating the issue is Waitek's 3167 coprocessor.andP;  This chip isbest-suited to the high-end market of scientific and CAD software.andP;  For thoseprograms that specifically know the Weitek chip and can take advantage of it,the 3167 is an excellent deal.andP;  But compared to the number of applicationsthat use the 387, the amount of Weitek-based software available is small.andM;One thing all these chips have in common is their price.andP;  The 33MHz versionscarry list prices hovering around $1,000.andP;  Mail-order pricing can bring downthe cost by almost half, but even that can be a hefty expense.andP;  And if yoursoftware isn't fine-tuned to use the coprocessor, your money would be betterspent on a hard drive upgrade.andM;MAKING DO WITH LESSandM;When it comes to buying a car, everyone knows that if you decide on a manualtransmission instead of an automatic one, and forgo the power door locks andelectronic windows, you win up with pretty much the same car for a whole lotless.andP;  This same buying principle works even better when it comes to choosinga computer.andP;  While everyone might desire the 400MB hard drive option or thebig-screen Super VGA monitor and card combo, these items can quickly double asystem price into something no longer affordable.andP;  The answer: Consider abase version.andM;Vendors tend to define base versions in one of two ways.andP;  A bare-bones systemlets you essentially add in everything outside of the motherboard and casefor a certain fee per item.andP;  Add-ins would include otherwise basic componentssuch as the hard drive, video card, monitor, and floppy drives.andM;To other vendors, a base system is really a company-defined&quot; standardconfiguration&quot; that lumps desired features into a price-competitive system.andO;Any deviation from the base tacks on an extra charge.andP;  The common rule inboth instances is that the less you add, the more you save.andM;For example, one vendor's advertisement features a barebones system thatlists a 33MHz 386 with keyboard, case, and power supply for $910.andP;  But addthe vendor's 40MB hard drive option, 2MB of RAM, a floppy drive, andmonochrome monitor, and the total price jumps to $1,479.andP;  Go all out, optingfor the 200MB hard drive and 14-inch 1,024 by 786 VGA system, and the totalsoars to over $2,489--nearly triple the original base price.andM;Another vendor's advertisement, featuring its standard configuration-stylesystem, list a 33MHz 386 with 64K cache, 4MB of RAM, on 80MB hard drive,case, power supply, floppy drive, keyboard, and 640 by 480 VGA monitor for areasonable $2,259.andP;  But change the hard drive to a 330MB ESDI model and optfor a Super VGA color monitor, and the system price shoots to $3,469--a jumpof over $1,200.andM;Generally, you'll find the best buys in these advertised base-unitspecials--precisely because the vendors are counting on you to add a littleof this or a little of that until the final price bears little resemblance tothe original advertisement.andP;  However, not everyone will need a 200MB harddrive or expensive graphics.andP;  And if you're running Windows, 2MB of RAM willwork in a pinch, and you can always add an additional floppy drive later.andM;If you can stick with a base system offers what you need without a lot ofwhat you don't, you still get to drive off the lot without going broke.andM;POINT/COUNTERPOINT: UPGRADEABLE SYSTEMSandM;POINT/BILL O'BRIENandM;Right now I can buy an 80386X in either 16MHz or 20MHz speeds, an Intel 80386that runs at 16Mhz, 20MHz, 25MHz, or 33MHz, or an AMD AM386-based computerhigh-stepping along at 40MHz.andP;  If you consider that each of these computerscan be had with or without processor RAM cache, that's 14 possibilities.andP;  Andthat doesn't even take into account the six possible 80486 computer modelscurrently available.andM;Even if we stick to just the 33MHz 386 computers in this buyers's guide,given the present rampant rate of technology, by the time my order isprocessed and delivered, there's a good chance that my computer will beoutdated.andP;  Granted, my $2,500 may not be a lot of money in the grand schemeof things, but that doesn't mean I should risk throwing it away because Ican't get assurance that a computer I buy now will still be a working tool ina year or two.andP;  That's the case for a modular computer, and I don't think youcan disagree.andM;COUNTERPOINT/ALICE HILLandM;I know that technology is fast, but let's not get carried away here.andP;  No onewants to get stuck with old goods, but buying into an upgradeable machine isa nice idea that has little to do with time or saving money.andP;  First, the costto upgrade does not come cheap.andP;  Dell, for example, offers a 486 upgrade thatcost $2,500.andP;  That's $2,500 for a $500 processing chip on a green plasticboard.andP;  By the time you can afford that kind of additional investment, you'restill saddled with a computer that's probably outdated in other ways.andM;Who knows, in a couple of years, the 586 may be all the rage of 486upgradeability won't help you there.andP;  The latest motherboards might wind upthe size of an index card, with 32-bit ISA slots, on-board graphicscoprocessors, and 16MB of base RAM.andP;  Upgradeability will never hold back theeffects of time because systems evolve in more ways than their processingchips.andP;  We don't buy upgradeable cars for much the same reason: Changing theengine just won't make a new model out of an old oneandM;POINT/B.O.andM;A couple of years? A couple of years?andP;  A computer pretty much obsoletesitself in about three years (and if you follow IBM'S pattern of releasing newequipment, sometimes that's a much more active process).andP;  What are yousupposed to do in the meantime?andP;  As much as Dell has grown up to be a finecomputer company, its pricing is hardly typical of the rest of the market.andO;While you couldn't buy another Dell computer for the price of Dell'sprocessor upgrade, you could buy at least one of the other computers wereviewed.andM;But let's widen your thinking a little.andP;  Why stop at believing that it's justthe processor that can be upgraded?andP;  Why not consider an entirely upgradeablecomputer much like the old S-100 systems?andP;  All you ned is a box with slotsand everything else--everything--can be swapped out.andP;  If you consider thateven hard drives can be handled in that way, there are absolutely noimpediments to creating such a system--or buying one.andM;COUNTERPOINT/A.H.andM;There isn't a new upgradeable machine out there claiming to be &quot;a box withslots.&quot;andP;  These machines are full-fledged systems with real system price tags,and the point is not to swap out everything, but to instantly plug in newprocessing muscle.andP;  By your way of looking at things, an old XT can be calledan upgradeable unit--in fact, those systems often are, technically.andP;  Changinga motherboard or putting in a better hard drive and a high-density floppydrive is upgrading the old way--inexpensively and efficiently.andM;What we're talking about here, in case you forgot, is this new-frangledscheme called plug-and-go upgrading.andP;  The sell is in the fact that you're notsupposed to buy anything else, or swap out everything in sight.andP;  The lure isin the supposed one-shot switch to a new platform, and even you, by the soundof your argument, never fell for it in the first place.andP;  Of course, it's notthat simple, and this solution is no shortcut by any means.andP;  But you alreadyknew that.andM;POINT/B.O.andM;The concept of a motherboard in your PC is founded in IBM's (and Apple'sbefore it) desire to control the peripherals that go into the machine.andO;Upgradeable processors are just the tip of the iceberg.andP;  When I had my S-100bus system, anything was possible.andP;  Instead of sending back my entirecomputer for repair if there was a problem with the processor, all I shippedwas a card--boy, did that save a shipping damage to the 8-inch floppy drives.andM;Upgrades do work--when they're implemented seriously and not just offeredbecause they're trendy.andP;  And if we're going to keep the price of computersdown as the possible inventory levels of different processors go up,upgradeability is the only solution that makes any sense.andM;COUNTERPOINT/A.H.andM;I see why you're so gun-shy, but computers get old before our eyes.andP;  You madethe case yourself by mentioning those 8-inch drives in your S-100.andP;  When youreally look at an upgradeable machine, the upgrade choices have nothing to dowith insuring the future and buying into the most advanced technology.andP;  Thechoices are the same old things you could buy anywhere today, but simplycan't afford.andP;  The hottest technology will always cost you a fortune, and thebargains will always be in last year's models.andM;WHAT WAS EVALUATEDandM;Featured in this buyer's guide are 80386-based computers running at 33MHz.andO;All the evaluated models have 4MB of RAM, 32K or 64K of processor cache RAM,both a 1.2MB and a 1.44MB floppy drive, a 200MB IDE hard drive, and a SuperVGA video card and monitor.andM;The only exception to this is Everex, which supplied a machine with only onefloppy and a 124MB hard drive.andP;  Everex does sell a machine that fits thebuyer's guide requested configuration, and a price for such a system islisted in the Features Chart.andM;The manufacturers of the machines profiled are the most prominent onesavailable in the mail-order channel.andP;  Each computer was evaulated in sixcategories: System Check, Expansion Capability, System Components, PeripheralComponents, Upgrade Features, and Service and Support.andP;  The results arediscussed in the six Applications Focus articles that follow and theindividual Product Profiles.andP;  The Sytem Check Applications Focus takes a lookat the FCC certification of the computers, setup, software and other extrasincluded at no charge, and documentation.andM;The computers vary in case size and shape--although many manufacturers offermore than one type.andP;  There are desktop units, towers, slimlines, andsmall-footprints.andP;  The different case types have various expansioncapabilities.andM;Aside from this difference, all the systems have basically the sameconfiguration and are, with a few exceptions, remarkably close in price.andP;  Soyou should pay particular attention to the service and support area.andP;  TheFocus pieces point out the most important features for comparative shoppingand contain buying tips to help you make the right final choice.andM;The Product Profiles take a close look at each machine.andP;  They discuss acomputer's price, and examine its outstanding features and weaknesses.andP;  Inthe profiles, you will find out whom makes the computer's motherboard and allthe important components in a standard configuration.andP;  The profiles will alsotell you if the system should be high or low on your shopping list.andM;Finally, the Features Chart at the end of the buyer's guide will give youdetailed information on a great many other 386 33MHz computers sold by mail.andO;This chart is an easy way to compare some of the key features of a system inwhich you're interested against almost all the other models on the market.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
