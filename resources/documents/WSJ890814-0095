Over the past 16 months, several states have proposed laws drastically reducing the need for motorists to pay for such a waiver, which costs as much as $13 a day and is similar to insurance. But some car-rental companies have talked many of those states into withdrawing these bills, which essentially ban the waiver. And last week, in a move that may stall remaining efforts to wipe out the waiver, Alamo Rent A Car Corp. sued Illinois for passing such a bill.    The optional waiver is essentially an agreement that a car-rental company won't charge the driver for any car damage in many cases. Consumer advocates and state attorneys general have long criticized the waiver for being too expensive; renters spent an estimated $500 million on the add-on in 1987, even though they caused only $260 million in damage to rented cars.    What's more, many drivers pay for the waiver without realizing their own automobile insurance policies may cover such damage. &quot;Pure and simple, it's a rip-off,&quot; says Steve Gardner, an assistant state attorney general in Texas. &quot;It has to go.&quot;    But smaller car-rental companies say they need the waiver to compete with the majors. Large car-rental companies may be able to absorb damage costs, but smaller outfits say they can't. (Hertz Corp. and Budget Rent a Car Corp., in fact, support banning the waiver.)    &quot;The penalty is particularly severe {for} the smaller companies,&quot; says Michael LePlaca, an attorney for the Car Rental Coalition in Washington. &quot;In some cases, their fleet is under 100 cars. The loss of one vehicle is a big problem.&quot;    So far, the smaller companies are winning. Last year, lawmakers in California, Hawaii, Florida and many other states proposed bills banning the waiver. But after intense lobbying by some local car-rental concerns this year, Hawaii and Florida dropped their bills. California passed a weaker bill, capping the waiver fee at $9 a day and mandating disclosure of what it covers. In all, seven states have backed off passing any bills. At least another dozen states have passed legislation requiring only that waiver terms be disclosed fully. The only states effectively to ban the waivers are New York and Illinois. Those states limited the amount car-rental companies can charge for automobile damage to $100 in New York and $200 in Illinois -- which eliminates most people's need to take the waiver.    But last week, Alamo sued Illinois, alleging the law deprives the company of its rights to recover damages to its cars. And some states that are still considering bills will probably hold off now to see how the Illinois law fares in court, officials in those states say. Alamo's suit, &quot;will put the brakes on even more,&quot; says Art Weiss, an assistant attorney general in Kansas.    Still, consumer advocates aren't giving up. In February, Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) proposed a bill in Congress to eliminate the waiver on cars rented less than 30 days. That bill is still in committee. But, says the representative's spokesman, &quot;We're picking up some broad-based support.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
