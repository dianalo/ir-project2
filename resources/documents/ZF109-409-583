(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>USED EQUIPMENT: COST SAVINGS WITHOUT CUTTING CORNERSandM;For companies not in dire need of the latest and greatest in hardwaretechnology, used equipment can offer an excellent savings opportunity.andM;However, it can be costly to maintain used equipment, especially if theorganization wants to have all its equipment--used as well as new--servicedby DEC.andP;  Also, because many of the products on the used-equipment market havea limited upgrade path, used equipment it best suited to non-criticalapplications.andM;To make the most out of an excursion into the used-computer market, an MISmanager should keep tabs on DEC's strategic plans: Any system introductionfrom DEC will dramatically affect the residual value of installed VAXequipment and the price of retaining service for those machines.andM;For example, DEC does not sell refurbished MicroVAX 2000s, although dealersare offering them for $5,000 to $20,000.andP;  The maintenance costs of somedefunct lines can rise drastically, however, and thus affect the overall costof ownership.andM;Most often, independent used-equipment vendors, as opposed to DEC itself,offer greater savings and faster delivery.andP;  DEC's delivery time runs aboutsix weeks: A dealer who has the desired equipment in stock can offerimmediate deliveryandM;Buying a computer from DEC does guarantee that DEC will service it.andP;  However,be advised that DEC makes the most out of many buyers' desire to remainwholly committed to DEC when it comes to used equipment.andP;  For example, arefurbished VAX 8800 when purchased from DEC can cost $270,000 vs.andP;  just$109,000 from a dealer.andM;In general, DEC's competitors sell refurbished VAX equipment at discountsranging from 20 percent to 50 percent of the published forecasts of residualvalues for refurbished equipment.andP;  This variation results in part from thespot-market nature of used-equipment sales; one never really knows when DECis likely to announce or release a product that will drive down refurbishedprices even more.andM;LET'S MAKE A (BETTER) DEALandM;To get the best deal in the used-equipment market, buyers must research theprojected life span of their intended purchase and the long-term viability oftheir potential supplier.andM;For example, although there may seem to be bargains galore in thediscontinued VAX 8000 series, a system manager planning for the long-termability to expand should look elsewhere.andP;  The problem with the VAX 8000series stems from the fact that its price/performance advantages were quicklyovertaken by DEC's VAX 6000 series, and that DFC is gradually moving awayfrom the BI bus used in the 8000 line.andM;Prices for used computers are indeed enticing.andP;  According to figures providedby Technology Investment Strategies, a market research company in Framingham,Mass., prices for used VAX 8000 computers have plummeted and are expected todrop even further.andP;  (See chart above).andM;But residual values are also falling dramatically on mainstream VAX lines.andO;According to Computer Economics, a market research company in Carlsbad,Calif., the VAX 6310, listed at $184,100 in the first quarter of last year,will drop in price to $47,300, just 26 percent of its original value, by May1991, and to $3,700, 2 percent of its original price, by May 1995.andP;  A usedVAX 6310 is currently priced at about $155,000.andM;Whereas DEC product life cycles formerly averaged three to five years, theynow span six to 12 months.andP;  For instance, the latest VAX 6000 Model 400release is the fourth version to be introduced in about two years.andP;  And theVAX 6000 Model 500, scheduled to be announced in October, will no doubt drivedown the residual values of the entire 6000 line even more.andM;For example, a prospective buyer may be faced with a choice between a new VAX6000-410 and a used VAX 8650.andP;  The price is about $179,713 vs.andP;  about$60,000, respectively, for the CPUs and licenses, not including the memoryand peripherals.andP;  (See &quot;Calculating cost of computers,&quot; page 34.)andM;Whereas the VAX 6000-410 provides 9.88 MicroVAX II units of processing(MVUPs), the VAX 8650 offers 7.78 MVUPs as well as better-packed decimalCobol processing and faster backup speeds.andP;  For customers who don't need orwant expandability, the VAX 8650 will often do the job.andM;Essentially, the VAX 6000 series is priced between $18,000 and $25,000 perMVUP new, compared with the VAX 8000's $7,700 per MVUP.andP;  But with the VAX8000 series, the tradeoff is that the ability to upgrade is essentiallyforfeited.andM;On the low end of the DEC system line, used MicroVAX processors andworkstations are now selling for 25 percent to 71 percent of their originallist prices and are expected to be priced at 2 percent to 9 percent of theirlist prices by 1994.andM;On the peripheral side, used disk drives and printers might be dirt cheap,but buyers run the very real risk of buying an item that has seen too muchwear and tear.andP;  Memory and CPUs rarely break down, and in fact theirdefects--if any--are more likely to show up soon after purchase.andM;These completely electronic devices stand up to long-term wear, whereas diskdrives and printers are electromechanical and consequently suffer more wearand tear from long-term use.andM;Even used-peripheral purchases backed up by a responsive maintenance contractcan't always turn the trick.andP;  If the used equipment goes down twice as oftenas the new, the true cost of ownership rises because of the productivity lostto downtime.andM;Computer Economics' forecast for residual prices on DEC printers andterminals shows savings similar to that found with used computers.andP;  Forexample, an LN03-AA laser printer that listed at $2,895 in 1985 is now pricedat about $1,250, or 43 percent of its list price.andM;According to Computer Economics' projections, the printer will sell for about$800 by June 1991 and drop in price to about $100 by June 1994--28 percentand 2 percent, respectively, of the original DEC list price.andM;The Computer Economics figures indicate comparable savings for DEC-compatibledisk drives and controllers.andP;  Used-product prices range from 6 percent to 74percent of the original list price.andM;It can pay to shop with a dealer of new and refurbished DEC andDEC-compatible equipment: A dealer would probably be more willing to sell aDEC-compatible drive than DEC would.andM;MORE THAN JUST HARDWAREandM;The price of the used equipment itself is just the beginning.andP;  In most cases,the purchaser has to pay all freight charges, insurance and installation.andO;These vary, of course, based on the distance covered and the amount andweight of the materials.andM;Buyers may save on installation charges if they have purchased from aused-equipment vendor.andP;  Installation charges incurred from the used-equipmentvendor generally run 40 percent to 50 percent lower than those charged byDEC.andM;On a non-contract basis, the ballpark figure is $150 per hour plus traveltime and expenses.andP;  For a two-day VAX 8650 installation, this comes out toabout $2,400, not including expenses.andP;  For a one-day installation of a 6310and a 8550, this translates to approximately $1,200.andM;The major potential downside to third-party used-equipment purchases is thatDEC manipulates its maintenance fees to encourage users to purchase newsystems.andP;  For example, DEC's maintenance on a VAX 8600-class machine runs ashigh as $24,000 per year, or 40 percent of the machine's $60,000 purchaseprice.andM;This situation can often be circumvented by contracting with a third-partymaintenance organization, or a used-equipment dealer.andM;As in the case of installation, savings amount to an average of 45 percent.andO;And the technicians are often as qualified as DEC's field serviceprofessionals.andM;Legal sources caution that when negotiating any used-equipment contract,buyers should demand a certificate of maintainability guaranteeing that theproduct can be maintained by either DEC or a third party.andP;  The contractshould also specify exactly what refurbishments have been made, includingcosmetic improvements like cleaning and painting.andM;BEWARE OF DISCLAIMERSandM;One trick that an unscrupulous dealer may try, and something buyers shouldpay careful attention to, is the inclusion of a disclaimer-of-warrantystatement to the contract.andP;  Essentially stating that there is no warrantyexpressed or implied, this disclaimer overrides any other warranty includedin the contract, such as a warranty of fitness of use.andM;Because of these considerations, it is crucial that buyers of used equipmentdeal with vendors that have proven track records.andP;  Many buyers prefer topurchase through dealers associated with professional organizations such asthe Digital Dealers Association (DDA).andP;  Groups such as the DDA require thatmember dealers meet certain standards of professional conduct, providing somelevel of assurance for prospective buyers.andM;The DDA is working to require that any equipment purchased from its memberscarry a certificate of maintainability and that DEC will install theequipment at current engineering change order (ECO) and field change order(FCO) levels, though the latter is more difficult.andP;  Getting a machine withcurrent ECO and FCO levels is important, because ECO and FCO represent theminimum acceptable levels for DEC maintenance.andM;This requirement can mean board upgrades that, depending on the equipment,range in price from $200 to more than $10,000.andP;  However, some buyers reportgetting a better deal by purchasing a machine that hasn't met these levelsand then paying for the board upgrades themselves.andM;In addition, if a customer teams up with a dealer that is familiar with theproper procedures for operating system relicensing, the customer isguaranteed that upon transfer of ownership, the system comes with a validoperating system license.andP;  If a buyer purchases an unlicensed system, he orshe may have to fork over $1,000 to $100,000 for a new license.andM;This consideration is particularly important when purchasing a used VAX 6000or MicroVAX, thanks to DEC's enforcement of a VMS licensing requirement forthese machines, whereby users must pay the full price of a license unlessthey buy a bundled upgrade package from DEC.andP;  (See &quot;DEC enforcement of VMSlicensing policy raises upgrade costs,&quot; DR, Aug. 20, page 1.)andM;ONE MANAGER'S STORYandM;The great effect that licensing can have on a used-equipment deal is evidentin the following example.andP;  One manager purchased a VAX-11/750 from a dealer;the previous owner had not requested license updates for several years.andP;  Whenthe new owner requested an update from DEC, DEC informed him that the machinedid not have a valid license.andM;In this instance, the user had a letter from the dealer stating the machinehad a current license.andP;  In the meantime, the user, because he needed themachine, paid $9,000 to acquire a valid license--though he eventuallycollected a refund from the dealer.andM;In short, dealers cannot rely on the end user's word alone to determine if amachine to be refurbished is actually licensed.andP;  Buyers should be sure to dobusiness with dealers that can address this issue satisfactorily.andM;MIS managers who plan to sell or trade in their own used equipment as part ofa deal with a used-equipment vendors can often negotiate a sizable discounton purchasing new and/or used equipment.andM;However, MIS managers need to be aware of, and fulfill, their ownresponsibilities as well.andP;  This will help facilitate present dealings andpave a smooth path for future transactions, too.andM;For example, a common problem for end-user companies that want to sell andreplace their used equipment is that they are often unsure of their exactholdings.andP;  They must inventory the used equipment carefully, noting allperipherals and model numbers.andP;  The easiest way to do this is to checkequipment on-hand against the organization's bill of materials andmaintenance contract.andM;WHEN TIME IS MONEYandM;It is also essential for the end-user company to know exactly when it will beready to sell the equipment, because this will have a great impact on adealer's bid.andP;  The difference between being ready to sell immediately or sixmonths down the road could be as great as $50,000 for the larger DECmachines.andP;  If the timing is close to, or coincides with, a DEC introduction,the price of the refurbished equipment will be driven down further.andM;Current average purchase prices for a sampling of computers on theused-equipment market are VAX 8650, $35,000; VAX 6310, $130,00; VAX 8550,$55,000; LN03-AA printer, $650.andM;This markup, better than 30 percent, is fairly standard.andM;Asking for dealer references is a good idea in any transaction and isparticularly critical when trading used equipment.andP;  It is essential to checkwith credit bureaus and accept payment only in advance and in the form of awire transfer or cashier's check.andM;Horror stories abound of dealers who accepted delivery of equipment and neverpaid, and of other who made high offers but low deposits and never paid thebalance.andP;  after receiving the equipment.andM;MIS managers can realize the most return on their investment by keeping everysystem licensable under contract with DEC and selling it while it's still upand running.andM;Buyers should require dealers to agree in writing that they will provide theequipment in a reasonable amount of time and that the buyer has the right towalk away from or extend the deal with no financial penalties if this term isnot met.andM;Refurbished equipment offers significant advantages.andP;  There is an opportunityto pay fair marker price and, at the same time, get greater value per MVUP,plus receive more timely delivery.andM;In both the long and short terms, users at small companies who know exactlywhat they need can realize significant savings on acquisition costs for usedequipment.andM;By paying careful attention to installation andmaintenance charges, the wiseMIS manager can set aside additional funds for more equipment, software orpersonnel.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
