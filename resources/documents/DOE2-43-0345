The Department of Energy's(DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory has completed a three phase studyof karst subsidence in East Tennessee to quantify historical subsidenceactivity. The purpose of the study was to determine the principal factorswhich cause karst subsidence in the region. Techniques used and resultsobtained in this study form a basis for more detailed risk assessmentat the local scale within the region. As development pressures diminishavailable land for various uses, risk-based land use decisions must bemade to site critical facilities. To fulfill the study objectives a threephase study was designed including, (1) collection of subsidence dataand compilation of a database, (2) performance of detailed studies ofsubsidence in three, two-to-five square-mile areas, and (3) synthesisof data obtained to; quantify the predominant sinkhole collapse dimensions,and identify events prior to subsidence or collapse events which mayhave caused the event, and estimate the intensity of subsidence as afunction of geologic unit within subregional areas of higher and lowersubsidence risk. 4 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
