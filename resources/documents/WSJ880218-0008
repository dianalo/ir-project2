Bob Dole soared briefly on the one accident of geography and Mike Dukakis is aloft this week on the other. Aside from those two findings, and with Super Tuesday in the South still three weeks away, we'll have to remain content with merely reading tea leaves.    There are, however, some interesting portents from the New Hampshire brew. One is the early evidence that the voters of 1988 are no friendlier to would-be tax boosters than were those of 1984. Senator Dole and Bruce Babbitt have the scars to prove it.    Gov. Babbitt appears to have blown himself right out of the presidential race by advocating a new consumption tax during the Democratic debate just prior to the New Hampshire vote. He earned a sixth-place finish among the Democrats.    Mr. Dole's case is a little more complicated. He came into New Hampshire with a full head of steam from his victory in the Iowa caucuses, only to fade just before Tuesday's balloting. On NBC Tuesday night, he bitterly blamed Bush TV spots that he said unfairly depicted him as a tax booster. What better testimony could you have that carrying such a label is equivalent to smallpox this year, just as it was for Fritz Mondale in 1984?    Were the Bush ads unfair? Maybe partly so. But Senator Dole has presented himself as the candidate of &quot;realism.&quot; He helped President Reagan win tax reforms but he also helped push through the infamous 1982 TEFRA tax boost. More to the point, he has waffled on challenges by his Republican opponents to forswear tax increases.    The voters, we suspect, now know quite well that the key to balancing the budget is not to raise taxes but to deny Congress tax increases and thereby force it to curb its propensity to spend. Mr. Dole's assurance that he can &quot;work with Congress&quot; was not the message the voters wanted to hear. It is more plausible that they want a candidate who will work against Congress, reasserting the legitimate right of a President to fight a colossal waste of public money.    Vice President Bush has avoided any suggestion of a cozy relationship with Congress and, with his impressive win in New Hampshire and a total of 61 delegates, has become the Republican front-runner. Senator Dole has 42. Jack Kemp, with 35 and a chance to pick up some more in Minnesota and South Dakota, is still in the chase.    The Democrats present far greater complexity. Mike Dukakis did well in New Hampshire but his reputation as a big taxer and spender, if exploited by his opponents, may not play well with Democrats as the campaign progresses. Dick Gephardt will continue to bid for the union vote with his procompetitive rhetoric and anti-competitive policies. Albert Gore and Jesse Jackson hope to do well on Super Tuesday. Paul Simon is pinning his few remaining hopes on Minnesota and South Dakota.    The Democratic race could become a four-candidate dead heat, which would make for an interesting convention with last-minute deal making and surprises. But it is too early to predict any such outcome.    If, however, the vote in the up-and-coming state of New Hampshire has demonstrated to all the candidates the unwisdom of running on a pro-taxation platform, that is a very big issue to have so quickly resolved. </TEXT></DOC>
