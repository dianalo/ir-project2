The decision came after the Democratic-controlled chamber votedoverwhelmingly to invoke cloture and end an attempt by Republicanconservatives to block final action on the measure.   The chamber also voted down, 60-32, a move to permit up to 10days, instead of 48 hours, for notification.   The House is considering a similar bill, but President Reaganhas threatened to veto the legislation because he argues that it isan unconstitutional restriction on his authority in the foreignpolicy field.   The bill overhauls procedures for informing Congress aboutintelligence activities. The most controversial provision was theone requiring that Capitol Hill be told about covert operationswithin 48 hours after they begin.   The bill was chiefly written by Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine,vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and also a member ofthe committee which last summer investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   Reagan withheld notice from Capitol Hill for 10 months that U.S.arms were secretly being sold to Iran. Some of the money wasdiverted to the anti-Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.   Current law requires only that the president give ``timelynotice'' to Capitol Hill about covert action, but does not definethe term.   Cohen and other backers of the legislation have argued that hadReagan told Congress about the planned sale of weapons to Iran, thelegislators might have complained so loudly that the deal wouldhave been scuttled.   Cohen said the 48-hour time period was suggested by intelligenceofficials, who said it could be met.   As it returned to the bill, the Senate voted 73-18 to limitdebate. That was 13 more votes than needed to invoke cloture andhalt the Senate practice of unlimited debate.   Then, the chamber killed, by a 60-32 margin, an amendmentproposed by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., to extend to up to 10 daysthe period during which information about covert actions can bewithheld. Chafee said, ``I think this is a sufficient time'' forthe completion of covert actions such as a hostage rescue, but itwould block anything like the Iran-Contra situation.   The House Intelligence Committee is considering a similar bill,but Reagan has already decided to veto any such legislation becausehe believes it is an unconstitutional restriction on his authorityto conduct foreign policy, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci saidlast week.   Carlucci took over as Reagan's national security adviser in thewake of the Iran-Contra affair.   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., told his colleagues Tuesday that``this bill is badly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of itsconceptions is that somehow you can legislate intelligence. ...It's hard for me to believe that one piece of legislation canobviate stupid activity.''   If the measure passes, ``we can perhaps prevent anotherIran-Contra,'' said Wallop, but ``we would deny some very wholesomeactivity.''   Wallop claimed that the bill ``would substitute our judgment forthat of the president.''   But Cohen said, ``nothing could be further from the truth'' andargued that the Senate ``should not abdicate its constitutionalresponsibility.''   The Senate is a ``co-equal'' to the White House and shouldshoulder the burden of overseeing actions by the intelligenceagencies, Cohen said.</TEXT></DOC>
