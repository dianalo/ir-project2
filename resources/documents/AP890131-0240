The fact is, however, that no such effort can help society avoidpaying the cost of bailing out insolvent thrifts, estimates of whichseem to be at a rock- bottom low of $20 billion and an uncapped highof more than $100 billion.   It matters not what you call the vehicle for raising the money _a tax, a fee or an increase in insurance premiums _ it is inevitablethat a large number of ordinary Americans are going to pay for it.There is no other way.   It matters not, for example, who the culprits are or what theydid or the injustice of it all. You can jail the culprits, but youcannot transform mismanagers into financial geniuses who can earnback and pay what they lost.   The pain may be hidden in business assessments, but businesssooner or later passes on its costs to customers. There's no wayUncle Sam can pay, since he has hardly a dime in his pockets thatyou, taxpayers, didn't give him.   So testy is this matter, that it threatens to end PresidentGeorge Bush's honeymoon abruptly. Bush's proposal calls for a25-cent a year fee for every $100 on deposits at banks, creditunions and, of course, savings and loans.   Clearly, it has flaws. It might, for instance, unfairly penalizesmaller institutions and their depositors while allowing operatorsof large money market funds to escape. Conceivably, money could flowfrom one to the other.   But any proposal that is offered is likely to be flawed andsubject to criticism as unfair.   Recognizing this, William C. Dunkelberg, professor of economics,authority on savings and loans, and dean of Temple University'sSchool of Business and Management, offers this defense of Bush'sproposal:   ``Our problem is simply this: We failed to accurately forecast oranticipate the insurance liability for the Sandamp;L systems. So, wecharged too low a premium to cover the insurance claims.   ``Now, we need a surcharge that amounts to 25 cents per $100 ofdeposits. It means that if you have $100 in your local bank paying 5percent interest you will get $4.75 rather than $5 for every $100 ofsavings.''   Dunkelberg cites state automobile insurance charges as roughlycomparable.   ``During the 18 months I have lived in New Jersey, this hashappened a number of times to my automobile insurance. Liabilitiesfor uninsured and high- risk state insurance program weredramatically underestimated.   ``As a result, we were `taxed,' if you wish to use that word, tomake up the shortfall in the past premiums that had been charged.   ``I may be unhappy with the insurance premium boost, incensedover rumors of mismanagement, poor planning, fraud and other factorsthat produced the huge insurance deficit, but I cannot solve any ofthose problems by refusing to pay the `one-time' additional chargeon my premium to remove the deficit _ claims now owed by theinsurance system to thousands of innocent motorists.''   The Sandamp;L situation, he maintains, ``is no different.''   Many people affected to one degree or another will challenge thatassertion, and the entire proposal might be abandoned for anotherthat, in turn, is likely to be severely criticized.   The issue is basic and painful, one that touches on the phrase``we the people,'' so often cited to express pride in participatorygovernment.   Most often the reference is in regard to inherent rights. Therest of the definition defines obligations.</TEXT></DOC>
