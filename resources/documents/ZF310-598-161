 Preparinginformation to fax and processing it when received entails costsof its own, and fax output can be misdirected.andP;  Many firms re-keyall incoming faxes, a time-consuming and costly process.andO;Installing the right number of fax machines can be difficult aswell; some companies have too few machines and force employees tostand in line, while others have too many machines that sit idleall day.andP;  Security is also a problem.andP;  It is very easy to faxconfidential documents unless a full-time guard is placed on amachine.andP;  Fax use can e addictive, and telephone charges can behigh when long documents are sent for long distances.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TrendsFacsimileProductivityManagement of EDP.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fax use (and abuse) is so rampant in corporate America these days thatsomebody ought to put warning labels on the sides of the machines.andP;  Thelabels should read: &quot;Warning: Fax abuse can be hazardous to your company'sproductivity.&quot;andM;OK, I know I'm being overly critical.andP;  Faxing sure is better than thetraditional way of sending mail.andP;  Faxing is quicker, more convenient andsometimes cheaper than the standard alternatives.andP;  No messing with 27-digitmail stops and nine-digit ZIP codes; no envelopes, stamps or express-mailpouches.andM;And faxing can turn the lag time for getting information from one location toanother from days into minutes.andP;  Admittedly, the fax revolution has been onesmall step in the right direction for moving information around.andP;  But ithasn't exactly enhanced productivity.andM;We need to think beyond transporting paper.andP;  We need to consider what ittakes to prepare information on one end, then process it on the other end.andO;All too often, the contents of one person's fax ends up being put back intosomebody else's computer.andP;  The output of one computer must be input intoanother -- and human beings become the &quot;processors&quot; of information.andM;Take, for example, the sales group at a company I know.andP;  As regular asclockwork, the people at branch offices write up a status report at the endof every month and fax it to corporate headquarters.andP;  The report consists ofa couple of pages of data produced using a spreadsheet and a word processor.andM;At the headquarters, all the incoming faxes are stamped, sorted, copied ontoplain paper, rekeyed and then filed.andP;  The numbers go into a masterspreadsheet, and the text goes into a consolidated word-processing document.andM;Frankly, the process takes days worth of &quot;dumb-time.&quot; Participants expendgreat effort in the dim-witted process of rekeying and editing data.andM;The people at this company aren't happy about the amount of work it takes toproduce their reports, but they say fax machines are an improvement over theold method of mailing the reports to headquarters.andM;Back then, the lag time required to send the reports seemed to take weeks;now it's down to days.andP;  But the new process is not necessarily better.andM;Rekeying is just one productivity-robbing effect.andP;  There are others, such asthe waiting lines at fax machines.andP;  Most companies haven't been tooscientific about the placement of these machines.andP;  There never seems to bethe right number around -- either there are too few machines and people waitin line to use them, or there are too many machines and they (and thededicated phone lines that service them) are idle all day.andM;Another problem with the fax fad is security.andP;  Want to know what's going onin a company?andP;  Just hang out by the fax machine.andP;  I know some people who havefound it a great place for coffee breaks.andM;Unless somebody assigns a full-time guard to the fax room, you're likely tosee all kinds of company secrets roll out.andP;  And if the fax machine is locatedanywhere near a photocopier, you can count on a few extra copies ofconfidential documents being circulated.andM;And don't forget cost.andP;  Fax use can be habit-forming -- and it isn't always acheap habit.andP;  It can be especially costly when fax abusers start sending longdocuments.andM;I know of one place where staffers sent a 27-page document from one companydivision to another.andP;  That was a pretty bad story -- made even worse when Ilearned it was the information systems department sending the fax rather thantransmitting the file through E-mail.andM;How can you solve these and other fax-abuse problems?andP;  Is fax a fad that willgo away by itself, or is it here forever?andP;  Tune in next week for a few morethoughts on faxing.andM;--------------------Cheryl Currid is the founder of Currid andamp; Co., a Houston-basedcorporate-computing consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
