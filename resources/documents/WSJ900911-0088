I can only speak formyself, but I believe that many other Reservists, and indeedmembers of my generation, share my commitment.</LP><TEXT>   I volunteered to join the Army and eventually the Reservenot for tuition money and benefits, but so that I would beready to help our country in just this kind of crisis. Makeno mistake, I fear war and I fear death. I am married and Ihave a lot to lose. But I am willing to endure hardship andrisk my life to help our country defeat an aggressive leaderwho could kill millions in the future if left unchecked. Weneed only to remember Saddam Hussein's threat &quot;to scorch halfof Israel&quot; with chemical weapons to understand the danger.   I am not poor. I am not underprivileged. I earned myundergraduate degree at Harvard, and am about to start mysecond year at Harvard Business School. However, I am willingto leave my wife and delay both my education and career toserve our country in this crisis -- even if that means goingto war.   Mr. President, I know that many Americans, especiallymembers of the generation now in its 30s and 40s, can thinkof nothing but the tragedy of Vietnam when they see militaryuniforms or hear talk of war. But I have studied the historyof other wars. As a result, I do not forget the 6 millionJews who were murdered in the Holocaust or the 250,000American soldiers and sailors (young men like myself) whodied fighting the dictatorial perpetrators of these and othercrimes during World War II. There is no doubt that there aretimes when fighting a war is unnecessary -- even immoral.Perhaps Vietnam was one of those occasions. Perhaps not. Butit is equally true that there are times when a democraticpeople must go to war to halt aggression and atrocity.   Of course it would be best if you and other world leaderscould peacefully maneuver Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait andout of power. However, if you fail, please have confidencethat I am prepared, as many others in my generation are, tomake whatever sacrifice is necessary to do the job by forceof arms.   Mr. President, 50 years ago you faced combat for yourcountry in a just and necessary war. If you need me now, Iwill too.   ---   Mr. Meakem is a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve.</TEXT></DOC>
