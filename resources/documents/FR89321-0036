Robinson, Chief, GradingBranch, 202-447-3271.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>An initial determination has been made that this proposed rule is not amajor rule under Executive Order 12291. It will not (i) result in an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (ii) result in a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (iii) have significanteffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.This proposed rule has been reviewed for cost effectiveness under U.S.Department of Agriculture procedures established in Departmental Regulation1512_1 implementing Executive Order 12291. It would increase fees and chargesto cover escalating costs of providing Federal voluntary grading, inspection,and laboratory services. Federal law requires that users pay for theseservices. It is anticipated that these increases will not have a significanteconomic effect on producers, packers, and consumers. Furthermore, anydenial or disruption of grading/inspection services due to inadequate feesand charges could result in adverse impacts on the orderly marketing ofpoultry, rabbits, eggs, and egg products and on the quality of productsavailable to consumers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has determinedthat this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), because (i) the fees and charges merely reflect, ona cost-per-unit-graded/inspected basis, a minimal increase in the costscurrently borne by those entities utilizing the services; and (ii) competitiveeffects are offset under the major voluntary programs (resident shell eggand poultry grading) through administrative charges based on the volumeof product handled; i.e., the cost to users increases in proportion toincreased volume.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning theseproposed amendments. Comments must be sent in duplicate to the StandardizationBranch and should bear a reference to the date and page of this issue ofthe <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Comments submitted pursuant to this documentwill be made available for public inspection in the Washington, DC, StandardizationBranch during regular business hours.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Proposed Changes</ITAG>Each fiscal year, the fees for services rendered to operators of officialpoultry, rabbit, shell egg, and egg products by the AMS are reviewed. Acost analysis is performed to determine if such fees are adequate to recoverthe cost or providing the services. The fees are determined by the employee'ssalary and fringe benefits, cost of supervision, travel, and other andoverhead administrative costs.The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended, provides for the collectionof fees approximately equal to the cost of providing egg products inspection;voluntary egg, poultry, and rabbit grading; and laboratory services.The last fee increase was effective on May 1, 1987. Since then, Federalemployees' salaries have increased by about 6 percent, including a 4.1-percentincrease in salaries beginning in January 1989. Also, health benefits areup 28 percent, and salaries of federally licensed State employees haveincreased by about 9 percent. Additionally, the costs for workers' compensationincreased 15 percent.With the exception of salary increased for federally licensed State graders,costs of supervision and other overhead and administrative costs have alsoincreases for the reasons described above. These costs are covered by anadministrative service charge assessed on each case of shell eggs and eachpound of poultry handled in plants using resident grading service. In 1987,these rates were established at $.026 per case of shell eggs and $.00026per pound of poultry.These rates would be changed to $.027 per case of shell eggs and $.00027per pound of poultry. Also, these charges were set a minimum of $130 andmaximum of $1,300 per billing period for each official plant. It is proposedto change these amounts to $135 and $1,350, respectively.Overall, resident fees and charges would be increased about 10 percent.Due to the situations described above, the hourly rate for nonresidentvoluntary grading and inspection service would be increased from $23.20to $24.12. Likewise, the rate for such services performed on Saturdays,Sundays, or holidays would be increased from $24.92 each to $25.92. Thehourly rate for laboratory analyses for other than individual test wouldbe increased from $29.32 to $30.52, and the fees for individual tests wouldbe increased approximately 4 percent. Administrative charges for the residentvoluntary rabbit grading and egg products inspection programs and nonresidentvoluntary continuous poultry and egg grading programs will continue tobe based on 25 percent of the grader's or inspector's total salary costs.The minimum charge per billing period for these programs would be increasedfrom $130 to $135 per offical plant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Information Collection Requirements and Recordkeeping</ITAG>Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions containedin 7 CFR Parts 55, 56, and 70 have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C.
