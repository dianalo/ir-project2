In a second upbeat report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state jobless benefits fell for the second week in a row.    A surge in auto sales accounted for much of the January increase in retail sales. Without autos, retail sales rose only 0.2% after climbing a revised 0.9% in December.    Consumer spending is particularly important to the economy at the moment. Not only does it comprise two-thirds of the gross national product, but economists who foresee a recession or slow growth in 1988 have been predicting a substantial slowdown in consumer spending.    &quot;If what people were worrying about was that consumers were going to really retrench, certainly there is no evidence that consumers are,&quot; said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington.    The upward revision in the December figures bolsters the case for continued, modest growth in consumer spending. The department previously put the December increase in total sales at 0.7% and the increase excluding autos at 0.2%. The January numbers could be similarly revised, of course. The initial estimates are based on a small sample and often are changed as more data are collected. Rosalind Wells, chief economist for J.C. Penney Co., said, &quot;Our feeling here has been that consumer spending didn't dry up after Oct. 19 (when the stock market collapsed).People are continuing to spend.&quot;    Nevertheless, the Commerce Department noted that total retail sales in November, December and January were &quot;virtually unchanged&quot; from the prior three months.    Sales of durable goods, those intended to last more than three years, rose 1.3% in January after a 1.9% increase in December. Auto sales were up 1.6% on top of a 1.9% gain in December. And home-furniture sales rose 2.6% after falling 0.5% in December.    Sales of nondurable goods were unchanged after rising 0.7% in December. Sales at general-merchandise stores were up 2.5% after climbing a revised 1.4% the month before.    In all, the department estimated total retail sales in January at $128.08 billion, up from $127.46 billion in December. The January total was 8.5% higher than in January 1987. The figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for inflation. The measure doesn't count spending on services, a major portion of total consumer spending.    In a preliminary report last month, the department estimated that fourth-quarter GNP -- the value of all the goods and services produced in the nation -- showed a 3.8% decline in personal consumption, which includes retail sales and other consumer spending. James Smith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, said the change in the December retail-sales numbers makes likely an upward revision of that figure. Revised GNP numbers are due Feb. 25.    The Labor Department said initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 in the week ended Jan. 30 from 353,000 the previous week and 391,000 the week before that.    For the week ended Jan. 23, 2,273,000 people, or 2.3% of those covered by unemployment insurance, were receiving regular state benefits after seasonal adjustments. That's up from 2,225,000 the previous week, when the insured-unemployment rate was the same.    Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Jan. 23 rose to 2,914,300 from a revised 2,788,200 a week earlier. These figures aren't seasonally adjusted. </TEXT></DOC>
