The budget plan, approved 201-181 at a sparsely attended session, projects a $135.3 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year, out of nearly $1.1 trillion in total spending. That deficit figure nominally is less than the $146 billion red-ink total that would trigger across-the-board spending cuts -- called a &quot;sequester&quot; in Washington budget parlance -- under the Gramm-Rudman law.    But the White House budget chief yesterday repeated his warnings that, despite the numbers in the resolution, higher-than-anticipated interest rates and costly federal bank bailouts could push the deficit higher and set off the Gramm-Rudman cuts this summer. &quot;We are looking a sequester straight in the face,&quot; said James Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget. &quot;It's going to be very, very close at best.&quot;    Although the House budget document would set a goal of trimming the deficit, it would call for $400 million in new spending for low-income families saddled with high medical costs and for a new nutritional program that also is a farm subsidy. Spending on those programs would total $2.2 billion over three years.    The plan doesn't call for any tax increases, although tax increases are part of pending bills that would raise federal expenditures. The Senate is expected to adopt the non-binding budget resolution next month.    Only 26 Republicans voted for the budget resolution in the House. Some GOP lawmakers complained that the spending plan would increase too many categories of spending and that it finessed details. &quot;We shouldn't be adding anything,&quot; said Rep. Denny Smith (R., Ore.), who called the document &quot;ridiculous.&quot;    The budget plan would call for $294 billion in military spending, up from $285.4 billion in the current fiscal year. Non-military spending -- excluding programs such as Social Security, whose outlays are dictated by formula -- would be allowed to rise to $185.3 billion from $176.8 billion.    The agreement would include a 4% pay increase for all federal workers, although House leaders have said that they don't intend to include members of Congress.    The Reagan administration's original budget proposal for fiscal 1989 projected a deficit of $142.7 billion, just shy of the $146 billion Gramm-Rudman goal. In a letter to Rep. Delbert Latta (R., Ohio) that was released by Mr. Miller's office, the budget director said that the rise in interest rates &quot;may add several billion&quot; dollars to the projected deficit. Bank bailouts and higher-than-anticipated payments of claims on government-guaranteed loans &quot;may add several billion more,&quot; making the automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts likely, Mr. Miller said.    James Blum, acting director of the Congressional Budget Office, discounted Mr. Miller's warning. &quot;A sequester doesn't strike me as something that the administration would want to do right before the election,&quot; he said. In the end, he predicted, that Mr. Miller's office will respond to higher interest rates and other deficit-boosting developments with &quot;perfectly reasonable offsetting adjustments.&quot;    The administration will decide in July whether to change its interest rate forecast, a key ingredient in projections of the deficit. If it chooses to ignore the upward trend in rates, the chances of across-the-board spending cuts would be diminished.    Separately, Mr. Miller said he would recommend that President Reagan veto the agriculture appropriations bill if it reaches the White House in the form now before the House Appropriations Committee. He said the bill, in its current form, would &quot;seriously jeopardize&quot; the budget summit agreement signed by Congress and the White House last year. </TEXT></DOC>
