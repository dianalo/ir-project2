A dedicated triggerfor selection of {Lambda}{sub c}{sup +} {yields} pK{sup {minus}}{pi}{sup+}, D{sub s}{sup +} {yields} K{sup +}K{sup {minus}}{pi}{sup +} was used.A high resolution vertex detector consisting of charged coupled devicesand silicon microstrip detectors allowed the selection of very cleansamples of {Lambda}{sub c}{sup +} and D{sub s}{sup +}. We obtained aswell a large sample of D{sup 0} and D{sup +}. In a preliminary analysis,a total of 1200 charmed particles in 20 different channels are fullyreconstructed. Preliminary results on branching ratios are given. 11refs., 11 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
