North limited immunity to get him toturn over 2,848 pages of notes he took while a key White Houseoperative in the Iran-Contra affair.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said such immunity is among theoptions the panel will consider as it seeks to wrap up its probe ofconnections between U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels and LatinAmerican drug trafficking.   Other possibilities include subpoenaing North's Washingtonlawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., and enlisting the help ofexecutive branch agencies that should rightfully have thedocuments, say Kerry and his aides.   At a hearing Tuesday, Sullivan appeared on North's behalf andinvoked his client's Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination in refusing to turn over the dozens ofspiral-bound notebooks North compiled while running PresidentReagan's covert Contra aid program.   North, who retired this month as a Marine lieutenant colonel,did not appear.   North is one of several targets in a broad conspiracy case thatcharges he illegally diverted profits from the sale of arms to Iranto aid the Contras.   At the White House, President Reagan responded with an emphatic``no'' when asked whether he had ruled out granting pardons toNorth and to his former national security adviser, John M.Poindexter.   Reagan did not elaborate, but his answer came a day after hetold columnist Carl Rowan it would be wrong to grant pardons beforethe trial is over, and suggested he would be out of office whenthat happens.   Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward apardon for North and Poindexter, saying he did not think they wereguilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them.   Portions of North's notebooks previously given to congressionalinvestigators are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs,drug traffickers, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA.But large segments _ committee aides said about half the contents _have been blacked out by Sullivan or by White House censors.   ``It's the first time I ever heard of in history that anattorney who is not code-cleared, classified-cleared or even anysecurity clearance whatsoever, sits as the custodian of documentsthat have been walked out of the workplace of the most highlysensitive government agency that we have,'' said Kerry, chairman ofthe panel's narcotics subcommittee.   ``It's unheard of, and I think it's inappropriate,'' he said.   Kerry said Sullivan, in a closed-door meeting of the committee,presented an affidavit from North acknowledging the subpoena forhis notebooks but citing his constitutional right not toincriminate himself as justification for withholding them.   Kerry said the committee will meet again soon to decide what todo next.   It took 10 days for U.S. Capitol police to deliver the subpoenato North, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. Police who wereoutmanuevered by North at his Virginia home and elsewhere, finallythrew the papers into his car last Saturday while the former Marinewas stopped at a traffic light near his house, the Post said,citing unnamed Capitol Hill sources.   Kerry said he does not know what the notes might reveal ofimportance to his investigation, but believes his subcommittee musthave the documents in order to be sure it has done a thorough job.He promised that if turned over, the documents would be kept secret.   ``Why does the name of someone involved in narcotics appear inOllie North's notebook?'' he asked. ``These are unansweredquestions that still tell me there is a lot that has not yet cometo light.''   North, a former National Security Council staff member, directedmuch of the operation that sent arms to Iran and raised money tosupply the Contras at a time when Congress barred such aid.   He and Sullivan also have declined to provide the notebooks toLawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel who is prosecuting Northand others on charges stemming from the Iran affair.   Kerry said he has spoken to members of Walsh's staff about thematter, and ``it's clear they don't know as much as we do'' aboutthe case.</TEXT></DOC>
