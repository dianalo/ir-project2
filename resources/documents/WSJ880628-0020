A surge in U.S. commodity prices added to inflation fears and contributed to concerns that higher interest rates are coming, several traders said. Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds fell more than a point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount, erasing nearly half their gains of last week.    The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 8.96% from 8.85% Friday. Yields also rose on corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed issues.    In Japan, the yield on the government's bellwether 10-year bond closed above 5% for the first time since last November. Prices of West German and British government bonds also dropped, along with Eurodollar bonds.    &quot;There's a lot of focus on the possibility of overseas rates going up,&quot; said Maury Harris, first vice president at PaineWebber Inc. Moreover, the U.S. economy &quot;is in pretty good shape,&quot; he said, &quot;and the risks right now are on the side of inflation.&quot;    West Germany, Japan and Britain may act to boost rates, analysts said. That, in turn, could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. rates to keep the dollar from dropping sharply in the currency markets. The Fed's policy committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow and Thursday to review its strategy.    &quot;People still are legitimately concerned about inflation,&quot; said Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp. &quot;There is a lot of momentum in the economy. . . . Until we start seeing softness in the economy, and particularly in capital spending, we shouldn't expect to see any sustained downturn in rates.&quot;    Foreign Bonds   Japanese government bond prices fell on the weakness of the yen as well as on speculation about coming interest-rate increases in Japan and West Germany.    The government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.03% in the interdealer market, up 0.085 of a percentage point from Saturday's close and up 0.135 of a point from late Friday.    The issue ranged between 4.96% and 5.045%. The closing yield represented a price of 99.80 yen, down 0.55 yen from Saturday.    Traders are watching to see whether the Bank of Japan will raise domestic interest rates to defend the yen. The market also grew nervous late in the afternoon on rumors that West Germany is contemplating an increase in its discount rate.    West Germany's central bank raised its securities repurchase agreement rate last week by 1/4 point to 3 1/2%. Some analysts say the next step could be an increase in West Germany's discount rate, now 2 1/2%, to 3%.    The dollar's recent surge against other major currencies has prompted investment strategists to look for a further tightening by West Germany's central bank to defend an ailing mark. It also has spurred a slide in mark bond prices.    The West German government's 6 1/2% issue due 1998 was quoted late yesterday at a price of 98.30 bid, down 0.45 from Friday. The yield rose to 6.74% from 6.67%. Euromark issues also eased. The European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 ended 1/2 point lower at 97.10 bid.    In London, gilt, or government securities, prices ended as much as 5/8 of a point lower, with analysts saying Britain's May trade figures raised the chances of another round of base lending rate increases.    Dealers said market reaction to the data was relatively brief, with turnover falling back swiftly to low levels. &quot;There was no serious selling from the client base,&quot; said Sean Bagley, a director of Kleinwort Grieveson Charlesworth.    At the same time, there were few signs of investor willingness to buy bonds at the lower levels while the possibility of another base rate increase remains.    The British Treasury's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 fell 22/32 to 115 21/32 to yield 9.72%. Among shorter-term bonds, the 11 3/4% issue due 1991 fell 10/32 to 104 7/32 to yield 9.81%, and the 12% issue due 1995 declined 17/32 to 109 26/32 to yield 9.93%.    In the Eurodollar bond market, prices of seasoned Eurodollar issues gave up about 1/4 of a point.    With the dollar near its highs of the year, dealers had hoped to bring more dollar offerings for clients who reportedly included some well-known U.S. companies. But when the market eased, some apparently were delayed. -   Treasury Securities   Treasury bond prices, which outpaced other bonds in last week's rally, also led the way down yesterday.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 13.03 points, its largest one-day drop since June 17, to close at 1240.26. The index finished just above its low for the day of 1239.61. The high was 1248.21.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to 101 22/32 from 102 27/32 Friday. The government's latest 10-year notes declined to 100 3/8 from 101 5/32. The yield rose to 8.94% from 8.82%.    Adding to the bond market's gloom was the continued high level of the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other. The funds rate averaged 7.59% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up slightly from 7.56% Friday.    Several traders said the Federal Reserve appears to have recently tightened its credit grip slightly. They said the funds rate will continue to hover between 7 1/2% and 7 5/8%, up from its previous range of around 7 3/8%. Others, though, argue that the funds rate has been distorted by technical factors and that it will soon drift back to the 7 3/8% level.    Indications from the Federal Reserve continue to suggest that there has been no significant change in policy, and that the higher federal funds rate only reflects a willingness by the Fed to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.    Separately, the government sold new 13-week Treasury bills yesterday at an average rate of 6.59%. That was up from 6.51% at last week's sale. The average rate on new 26-week bills fell to 6.75% from 6.83% the previous week. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week           26-Week Applications ............ $24,301,870,000   $24,773,335,000 Accepted bids ............ $6,424,470,000    $6,412,640,000 Accepted at low price ............... 36%               87% Accepted noncompet'ly ...... $868,565,000      $746,425,000 Average price (Rate) ..... 98.334 (6.59%)    96.588 (6.75%) High price (Rate) ........ 98.342 (6.56%)    96.603 (6.72%) Low price (Rate) ......... 98.332 (6.60%)    96.582 (6.76%) Coupon equivalent ................. 6.80%             7.08%   Both issues are dated June 30. The 13-week bills mature Sept. 29, 1988, and the 26-week bills mature Dec. 29, 1988.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices fell as much as  3/4 of a point in light trading.   In the high-yield market, some Public Service Co. of New Hampshire debt securities bucked the trend by closing between one and two points higher.   The upswing came on a report that the utility wouldn't rule out an agreement to abandon its Seabrook nuclear power plant in an accord like the one planned for Long Island Lighting Co.'s Shoreham plant. However, PS New Hampshire said such an accord is unlikely. Heavy debt servicing obligations related to the $5.4 billion Seabrook plant forced the utility this year to file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.   The PS New Hampshire 17 1/2% issue due 2004, considered the utility's bellwether issue, closed at 49 1/4, up 1 7/8 points, for an indicated yield of 35.58%, but the utility isn't currently making interest payments on the debt.   Meanwhile, the dollar's recent strength is leading to more offerings that allow investors to benefit.   Market sources say the Student Loan Marketing Association is in the market with a $110 million issue of reverse principal exchange rate linked securities, also known as Reverse Perls.   Reverse Perls pay interest semi-annually in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate. However, the amount of principal that the investor receives at maturity depends on how the dollar performs against a specified foreign currency.   The security holder could receive an amount greater than the sum paid if the dollar rises substantially. Likewise, if the dollar falls in value, the noteholder may receive less than the principal amount originally paid.   Sallie Mae officials would say only that no announcement has yet been made regarding such a debt offering.   Municipals   Municipal bond prices edged lower in light activity.   Among bellwether issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 declined 3/8 of a point to 90 1/4 bid. The issue currently yields 8.06%.   Only one new issue was brought to market Monday, a $190.1 million offering for the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency. Those bonds were priced to yield from 5.25% in 1989 to 8.12% in 2002 through underwriters led by Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.   Separately, the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that would allow the sale of $1.3 billion of taxexempt bonds to help close the state's budget gap of about $1 billion.   A spokesman for Louisiana Gov. Charles Roemer said state officials expect the decision to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court but are confident that the deficit-closing plan will be able to proceed.   Under the plan, Louisiana would create a political subdivision that would be able to levy a one-cent sales tax. Debt service on the proposed bonds would be paid from the that sales tax.   The governor's spokesman said Louisiana officials hope that the bonds can be priced in mid-July. The size of the offering wasn't specified.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage-backed securities fell, but by less than comparable Treasury issues.   Dealers said the better performance of the mortgage market reflected several factors, including a lack of significant selling pressure by mortgage originators and the fact that Japanese investors aren't large holders of mortgage securities.   Japanese investors have been playing a significant part in recent price movements in Treasurys, but they haven't become major players in the mortgage market, partly because mortgage securities don't offer the cash flow and certainty desired by many Japanese portfolio managers.   &quot;The Japanese own the 10-year note and long bond, but not Ginnie Mae 8s,&quot; one trader said.   Mortgage securities also tend to perform better than Treasurys in declining markets because mortgages are considered more defensive investments.   Among active issues, the July Ginnie Mae 9% issue was quoted late yesterday at a price of 94 1/4 bid, down 1/2. The 10% issue was quoted at 100 2/32, down 10/32, to yield 10.12% to a 12-year average life assumption.</TEXT></DOC>
