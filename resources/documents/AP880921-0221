Kohlberg Kravis, the New York investment firm that has outbidDart for three other corporations in recent years, offered to pay$58.50 a share in cash and securities for Kroger in a buyout aimedat keeping the company's present management at the helm.   Kroger, which refused to meet with Kohlberg, indicated it wouldreview the offer but also would continue pursuing its own proposedrestructuring plan.   Kroger stock soared after the Kohlberg Kravis announcement,closing at $56.25 a share, up $3.50 from Monday in New York StockExchange composite trading.   Kohlberg Kravis offered to pay Kroger shareholders $50 in cashand securities valued at $8.50 for each share they own.   Dart, the Landover, Md.-based retailing company headed by theHaft family, has offered to pay $55 a share _ $43 cash andsecurities valued at $12 _ for each of Kroger's 78.6 millionoutstanding shares, or about $4.32 billion.   Kohlberg Kravis, in a letter sent to Kroger Chairman LyleEveringham, said its takeover plan would leave Kroger'sheadquarters in Cincinnati and its current management in place.   The firm specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a company isacquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with cashraised by the target company's cash flow or from the sale of itsassets.   Kroger's restructuring plan, valued at between $4.2 billion and$4.6 billion, was announced after learning that Hafts had receivedfederal clearance to buy at least $15 million in Kroger stock.   The plan would pay $40 a share in cash, plus securities valuedat $8 and a remaining publicly traded stock worth between $5 and$10.   Analysts earlier suggested that Kroger might turn to KohlbergKravis as a so-called ``white knight.'' Kohlberg Kravis won ahostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos. in 1985, in which theHafts were a bidder, and outbid the Hafts for Safeway Stores in1986 and Stop andamp; Shop Cos. earlier this year.   Kohlberg Kravis apparently offered to act as a white knight butwas rebuffed by Kroger management. The firm, in its letter,revealed that its request to discuss a buyout offer in aface-to-face meeting with Kroger advisers was turned down.   ``The entry of the Kohlbergs brings a whole new level ofseriousness to this,'' said Gary Giblen, a vice president withRotan Mosle Inc. in Houston.   Linda Morris, analyst with Provident National Bank inPittsburgh, said shareholders may lean toward the KKR proposalbecause it offers more cash.   Furthermore, because the Hafts have a reputation for pushingcompanies into takeover battles and then making a big profit byselling their stock on those companies, there was uncertainty overwhether Dart would pursue a costly takeover fight.   Morris called the KKR package ``a fair offer'' and said Krogerwould be hard pressed to top it, even if it joined up with anotherbuyout firm.   Morris speculated that Kohlberg Kravis was drawn to the dealpartially because it wants to spend some of its considerable fundsbefore the White House changes guard in November.   ``They are sitting on an attractive war chest,'' she said,adding that the federal government's attitude toward takeoveractivity could change once a new administration is elected.   In addition to bidding for Kroger, Kohlberg Kravis is engaged ina bidding war for publishing giant Macmillan. Macmillan has agreedto a $2.36 billion buyout led by KKR, but British publisher RobertMaxwell has made a competing $2.41 billion offer.</TEXT></DOC>
