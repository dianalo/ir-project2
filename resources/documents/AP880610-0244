Now we are about to set rules on this scandalous situation of(waste) exports going to developing countries unable to processthese materials.''   Clerc heads a 50-nation group of legal and technical expertsformed to prepare a global agreement on the shipment of hazardouswastes.   A preliminary list that was drawn up includes 44 types of wasteproduced by most world industry, especially those processingchemicals and minerals.   The meeting in Caracas included Western industrial countries andthe Soviet Union. The group was formed last year and is to holdanother meeting later this year.   Meeting delefates failed to agree on a demand by developingnations that transit countries be allowed to decide on wasteshipments passing over their territory.   Clerc said the conference agreed, however, that transit nationsshould be granted as much information as that provided to countriesreceiving the waste.   Disagreement remained on how long a transit nation could hold upshipments over its territory.   Greenpeace International, one of the 14 organizations attendingthe meeting, wanted more than emerged from the conference. In astatement read at the end of the meeting, representatives of theenvironmental organization called for a ``global ban'' on movinghazardous wastes across boundaries.   According to Greenpeace, the rate of such movements hasaccelerated in recent years. It said the main route for shippingindustrial wastes, historically between industrialized Europe andNorth America, ``has exploded into less-industrialized regions, inparticular Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America''.   U.S. delegate Andrew Senn, representing the State Department,commented, ``(The) Greenpeace stand is fine if you disregard theeconomic element. But there is one.''   Developed nations insisted at the meeting that processing wastecould involve significant transfer of technologies that eventuallywould help ecnomically developing countries.</TEXT></DOC>
