Dealers said there was no firm reason for the dollar's climb,although there was a brief rally after a report that U.S. durablegoods orders surged 6.4 percent in December. Many had expected a 0.3percent rise.   The dollar retreated somewhat when details showed some of thegains were from large defense and transportation orders.   The Federal Reserve sold some dollars for West German marks latein New York's trading session, dealers said.   The underlying demand for dollars comes from investors who wantto take advantage of relatively high U.S. interest rates, saidPhillip Eriksen, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Bank in SanFrancisco.
