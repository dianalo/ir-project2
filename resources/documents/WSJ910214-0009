A 10-company group including a unit of Fluor Corp.submitted the lowest bid for one wing of the terminalbuilding and another group including Bechtel Group Inc. wasthe low bidder for the other wing. Together, the Japanese-ledconsortia contain Japan's five biggest constructioncompanies.</LP><TEXT>   Although the bids were the lowest submitted by fourcompeting groups, both were higher than the amount budgetedby the airport, according to a spokesman for KansaiInternational Airport Co. The airport company said it willattempt to negotiate an acceptable price with the two groups,and hopes to sign contracts with them by the end of thismonth.   Neither the bids nor the airport's internal budget weremade public. But industry sources said the price for the twoterminal wings is expected to total around 150 billion yen($1.17 billion).   Kansai International Airport is being built on a man-madeisland in Osaka Bay. Its passenger terminal building,designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, will have 311,000square meters in floor space, making it the largest structurein Japan, according to the airport company.   The airport is one of 14 major projects included in a 1988U.S.-Japan agreement designed to pave the way for foreignconstruction companies to establish themselves in Japan. Butcomplaints over the handling of certain of the airport'scontracts -- particularly one for a so-called people-moversystem -- have made the airport a focal point for charges bysome that collusive behavior persists in Japan's constructionmarket. U.S. and Japanese negotiators broke off talks overpossible extension of the accord last month after reaching animpasse on, among other things, a U.S. request to increasethe number of designated projects.   One of the U.S. complaints about the current agreement isa requirement that foreign companies bid for projects asmembers of joint ventures. In the case of the terminalbuilding, the Kansai airport authorities requested that eachbidding group include 10 companies.   Fluor Daniel (Japan) Inc. and Overseas Bechtel Inc. areexpected to help with the overall management and schedulingof the construction work -- an area in which U.S. companiesare considered to have special expertise because of theirexperience with international airports. Fluor's parentcompany is based in Irvine, Calif., and Bechtel's is in SanFrancisco.   Tokyo-based officials of Fluor and Bechtel said they hopea contract agreement can be reached with the airport thismonth. But a spokesman for Takenaka Komuten, the Osaka-basedcompany heading Bechtel's group, cautioned that negotiationsover the contract price &quot;probably won't be easy.&quot;   Airport authorities are anxious to get the project underway, since complications in completing the island and anexpansion in the planned size of the terminal have alreadyforced them to delay the airport's opening date to mid-1994from early 1993.   Late last month a Japanese-led group including SchalAssociates Inc. of Chicago won an 11.41 billion yen ($89million) contract from Japan's Ministry of Transport to builda control tower and an administration building at theairport. And the airport company earlier this month named acatering group including Marriott Co. of the U.S. and anotherincluding Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong to serveairplanes using the airport.</TEXT></DOC>
