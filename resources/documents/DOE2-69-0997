This was particularlytrue in the case of the heat transport and shutdown cooling systems sincethese embody many components. This paper addresses the two helium circulatorsin these systems. An integrated approach is being used in the developmentof design and design documentation for the MHTGR plant. It is an organizedand systematic development of plant functions and requirements, determinedby top-down design, performance, and cost trade-off studies and analyses,to define the overall plant systems, subsystems, components, and humanactions. These studies, that led to the identification of the major designparameters for the two circulators, are discussed in this paper. Thisincludes the performance information, steady state and transient data,and the various interface requirements. The design of the circulatorsused in the MHTGR is presented.
