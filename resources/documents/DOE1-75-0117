Equipment employed for this work includesthe PB-3 M/1 rail track laying machine, rail carriages, four furthermachines (SBR 2/001, FRM 2/002, GSM 2/003 and SFV 2/005) for track gravelbed preparation, levelling and compacting as well as auxiliary equipment.Prefabricated rail track sections (in 900 mm track width) were 25 m long,had a weight of 11 t and kept a 800 mm distance between concrete sleepers.The time required for laying procedures is calculated: 12 sections wereplaced in 180 min, thus amounting to 100 m of track completed per hour.It is pointed out however that this time applies for straight track withoutcurves and obstacles.</TEXT></DOC>
