(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ruled Friday that the caseof a former graduate student accused of unleashing a ``worm''program into thousands of computers nationwide can go to trial.   A federal judge rejected pleas from the lawyer of Robert T.Morris to dismiss a felony computer fraud charge becauseinformation leaked by the Justice Department would prevent him fromreceiving a fair trial.   Morris' lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, contended the JusticeDepartment improperly revealed to a reporter before Morris wasindicted in July that Morris had given a statement to prosecutorsand that the department was considering whether he should beallowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor.   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson said no concrete proof wasoffered to show that Morris suffered from the Justice Departmentdisclosures. The judge scheduled the trial for Nov. 29.   In November 1988, a ``worm'' program that prosecutors saidMorris created clogged a network of about 6,000 computers shared bycolleges, research centers and the military.   It took several days to cleanse the network of the program,which multiplied out of control, overloading memories at suchplaces as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration inMoffett Field, Calif., and Air Force Logistics Command at WrightPatterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.   Computer industry experts estimated the down time and workinghours needed to combat the program cost from $5 million to $12million.   Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md., became the first person in thecountry to be charged criminally under the 1986 Computer Fraud andAbuse Act when he was indicted on a charge of gaining unauthorizedaccess to computers, preventing authorized access to computers andcausing losses in excess of $1,000.   Morris, whose father, Robert T. Morris Sr., is the chiefscientist at the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda,Md., faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine ifconvicted.   When the worm was unleashed, the younger Morris was a first-yeardoctoral student in computer studies at Cornell University, but hewas suspended from the school in May.   He remains free on his own recognizance.</TEXT></DOC>
