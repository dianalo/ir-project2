Not quite, at least for now.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, this assembly line belongs to Mazda Motor Co.,Ford Motor Co.'s 25%-owned Japanese affiliate. Mazda buildscars here for Ford on a contract basis, and Ford sells them,along with some vehicles exported from the U.S., in Ford'ssmall but growing network of Japanese dealerships. It is partof Ford's fledgling effort to crack the market here.   For years, even as Japan's auto makers invaded the U.S.,Detroit's Big Three did virtually nothing about Japan butcomplain. Now, Detroit is starting to view it as a market.The implications, potentially, are enormous.   Japan is the linchpin of the emerging Asian car market,whose future growth will far outstrip the mature markets ofEurope and North America. &quot;You can't be a world-leading autocompany and not have a major presence in the Asia-Pacificregion,&quot; declares W. Wayne Booker, a Ford vice president whoheads the company's operations in the area. &quot;So much salesvolume is going to be here that if you are only No. 10 in theAsia-Pacific market, you won't be No. 2 in the world.&quot;   Japan's auto makers, who already dominate their homemarket, are rapidly expanding in Southeast Asia -- perhapstoo rapidly for the Big Three, which are preoccupied withreversing their huge losses in the U.S. But the red ink athome shouldn't blot out the importance of Japan and the restof Asia, some U.S. experts believe.   Among them is Mr. Booker, a soft-spoken 57-year-old whoseviews on competing in Japan are decidedly unorthodox byDetroit standards. The market here really is open to Americancars, he contends, if the Big Three will mount a serious,long-term effort and not expect instant profits.   By pitting themselves directly against the world's bestauto makers in their home market, he adds, the Big Threecould practically force themselves to become competitiveworld-wide. For 20 years, most major advances in quality,efficiency and technology have been pioneered in Japan. Bynot being here, the Big Three have been slow to catch on andhave been run over by the Japanese.   America's Big Three got only 1.3% of the market here lastyear, minor-league stuff compared with Japan's 28% of U.S.car and truck sales. But that 1.3% is 102,000 vehicles; justa few years ago, Detroit was selling hardly anything inJapan. Finally, the Big Three are getting into gear.   In 1988, Chrysler Corp. set up a small dealership chain(now 50 stores) as a joint venture with a Japanese retailer.And in September 1990, Chrysler began selling Jeeps throughHonda Motor Co.'s extensive dealer network.   General Motors Corp. sells its cars in Japan throughYanase andamp; Co., the country's largest distributor of importedcars. GM sold 12,500 vehicles in Japan last year, a tinytotal but a tenfold increase from 1985. Just this month, GMboosted its corporate presence here by opening a technicalcenter near Tokyo to help sell GM components to Japanese automakers.   Ford appears best positioned, especially in Japan. It soldmore than 88,000 cars and trucks here last year -- enough tomake Ford the top foreign-car brand in the country. Most ofthose cars -- about 80,500 -- actually were made in Japan byMazda (though Ford handles the exterior styling), so theydidn't do anything to ease the U.S. trade deficit. In fact,some automotive experts question whether the Mazda-made carsqualify as real Fords.   But Ford and Mazda engage in mutual &quot;production by proxy&quot;around the world. They make vehicles for each other in theU.S., and they are nearing an agreement for Ford to make carsfor Mazda in Europe. Ford officials believe they have hit onthe quickest way to build sales and brand identity in Japanand to lay the base for future expansion here.   &quot;American auto makers have big market potential in Japan,&quot;declares Konen Suzuki, president of Ford of Japan. Inresponse to the surprise that remark generates, Mr. Suzukiadds: &quot;Did you believe in the late 1960s and early 1970s thatToyota would become so big in the U.S.?&quot;   Comparisons to Toyota Motor Corp.'s success in Americaseem rather premature, but if anyone can make this point, itis Mr. Suzuki. He spent 29 years at Toyota, including sevenin the U.S., and rose to the rank of managing director. Then,last February, he shocked Japan's auto industry by jumping toFord as the first Japanese president of Ford of Japan. It wasone of several steps Ford took to strengthen its Japanesetoehold.   In 1989, Ford moved its Asia-Pacific headquarters to Tokyofrom Australia and bought a 34% stake in Autorama, thenetwork of dealerships that sells Ford cars in Japan. (Mazdaowns 39%, with other investors holding the rest.) Next fall,Ford will start exporting right-hand-drive cars to Japan fromEurope (the Japanese, like the British, drive on the leftside of the road, but so far none of the Big Three shipsright-hand-drive vehicles to Japan).   Ford's next step, probably by the mid-1990s, will be todecide where to put its major Asian manufacturing base.&quot;Japan is obviously the logical place to be,&quot; says Mr.Booker, again expressing what is a minority view in Detroit.&quot;It has a well-established supplier base, a well-educatedwork force, and our principal competitors export cars fromhere. Why not put it here?&quot;   Actually, there are some good reasons why not to put it inJapan, as Mr. Booker himself acknowledges. In Japan, land isenormously expensive and the labor shortage increasinglysevere. So, Ford may choose Taiwan, where it already has athriving, though small, subsidiary called Ford Lio Ho.   But the fact that a Ford executive is even discussing aplant in Japan bespeaks an enormous change in attitude.Imported cars were banned from Japan between 1945 and 1974 --an oft-forgotten factor in the success of Japan's autoindustry. But even after the ban was lifted, a self-absorbedDetroit generally acted as if the Japanese market didn'texist.   Ford did try to ship cars to Japan from the U.S. in theearly 1980s but then gave up, hurt by the strong dollar andshoddy quality. The company started selling Mazda-made carsin Japan in 1982 but didn't resume shipping in American-madevehicles until 1988.   Even now, the Big Three's executives, especially ChryslerChairman Lee A. Iacocca, complain that they don't have fullaccess to the market here. The Japanese retort that Detroithasn't tried hard enough; they cite Mercedes-Benz, BMW andVolkswagen as evidence that foreign car makers can succeed inJapan.   Another foreign success story, ironically, is anonautomotive unit of Ford itself. It is The Associates, afinancial-services concern whose Japanese subsidiary, AICCorp., makes consumer loans.   AIC (in Japan it is pronounced Ike, as in Eisenhower)started in Japan in 1979. American competitors such as Avco,Household Finance and Beneficial already had entered themarket alongside major Japanese lenders. But between 1981 and1986, the other Americans, tired of waiting for big profits,sold out to AIC.   AIC doesn't always stick to American-style practices.Americans who borrow money from The Associates get a check todeposit in their bank. But Japanese consumers considered thatpractice embarrassing because the bank would know theyborrowed money elsewhere. So AIC gives its borrowers cash.   &quot;You need a home office with a long-term commitment to themarket, and you have to adapt to Japan,&quot; says AIC PresidentWilfred Y. Horie, a Hawaii native who is the only Americanamong his company's 700-plus employees. AIC has 152 officesand plans on 200 by the end of next year. Its return oninvestment tops 10%, double that of The Associates in theU.S.   As for cars, Ford once enjoyed enormous success in Japan.It was the first company to build cars in Asia and beforeWorld War II held 75% of the Japanese market. But in 1939, onthe eve of the war, Japan expelled the company. The road backhas been difficult. Japan has nine major car companies --three times as many as the U.S. -- and competition so fiercethat Isuzu Motors Ltd. is sustaining losses, and even Hondais struggling on its home turf.   In Japan, American cars have an image problem, which Fordmoved to repair last month. The company entertained reportersfrom Japan's auto magazines on a 10-day visit to the U.S.,where they visited Ford factories and test-drove Ford carsfrom Detroit to Atlanta.   &quot;American cars have improved significantly from severalyears ago,&quot; says Masaki Ogura, editor of Le Volant magazine.&quot;Unfortunately, they are still not so good as Japanese cars.&quot;The engine and transmission feel rough by Japanese standards,he adds.   Even the people who sell Ford cars in Japan agree. &quot;I knowthat there is trade friction between the two countries, butAmericans should make higher-quality automobiles,&quot; declaresYosuke Iwasaki, an official of the Autorama dealershipnetwork. In a suburban-Tokyo showroom that displays FordTauruses, a Thunderbird and Lincoln Continentals, Mr. Iwasakiadds: &quot;If they had higher quality, we would sell much more.&quot;   Ford executives see a need to improve quality further. Butthey are frustrated that Japanese strongly prefer to &quot;buyJapanese,&quot; while &quot;buy American&quot; attitudes have faded in theU.S. &quot;Instead of being looked down upon for being a member ofthe home team,&quot; says Philip E. Benton Jr., Ford's president,&quot;here you are looked up at for being on the home team.&quot;   Nonetheless, Mr. Suzuki, the Toyota expatriate now runningFord of Japan, expresses long-term hope. Some American cars,such as the Taurus station wagon, aren't duplicated by anyJapanese products, he maintains. He adds that althoughJapanese cars give better high-speed performance, Americancars offer what is perhaps more useful on Japan's crowdedroads: smooth, strong acceleration from a standing start.   Autorama now has 339 showrooms in Japan, and Ford plans anincrease to 370 next year. Over time, Mr. Suzuki says,foreign brands could get 10% to 15% of the Japanese vehiclemarket, up from about 4% currently, with most of the growthcoming from Detroit's Big Three.   But for now, he adds, &quot;we are almost starting from scratchand have a lot of things to do.&quot; Foremost among them isimproving Ford's service and repair network. Even if Ford'ssales boomed tomorrow, Mr. Suzuki explains, weak servicewould destroy the brand's reputation. &quot;Before a farmercultivates the field, he must take out the trees and stumps,&quot;he says. &quot;That is what we are doing.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          IMPORTS of foreign cars into Japan were curbed from theend of World War II until the mid-1970s by tariff duties andcommodity taxes. A page one article in last Tuesday's editionincorrectly said the imported cars were banned.   (WSJ Nov. 25, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
