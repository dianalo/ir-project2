graphics file format translation utility.andP;  With the addition of anumber of features, the application first saw distribution in October 1988 asBarneyscan XP, the color image-processing software bundled with theBarneyscan 35mm color slide scanner.andP;  In April of this year Adobe acquiredrights to the program and started implementing a long list of enhancements,with a planned ship date of February and a price tag of $895.andM;According to Steven Guttman, product marketing manager, Adobe Photoshop fitsvery well into the company's product line.andP;  &quot;We see Photoshop sharing muchthe same user base as Illustrator 88,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The two products are verycomplementary.&quot;andM;Using Adobe Photoshop.andP;  Because Adobe Photoshop employs a virtual-memorytechnique, loading and working with very large graphics files doesn't requirea lot of RAM, only a lot of hard disk space.andP;  Working with only 3 Mbytes ofavailable RAM on a Macintosh II, we were able to open and satisfactorily workwith 8-Mbyte and 2-Mbyte full-color graphics files simultaneously.andP;  Thedocumentation indicates that files as large as 300 Mbytes can be edited.andM;The tool palette's diversity may give you pause at first.andP;  It brings togethertools from paint programs such as Claris Corp.'s MacPaint and SuperMacTechnology's PixelPaint, from draw systems such as Adobe Illustrator 88 andAldus Freehand, and from image-processing systems such as Silicon BeachSoftware's Digital Darkroom.andM;Selection tools -- Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Lasso and MagicWand -- are grouped at the top of the tool palette.andP;  The Magic Wand tool,similar to the one contained in Digital Darkroom, is used to select pixels inan image based upon the similarity of their color.andP;  You can easily add to,delete from or refine selections as required.andM;Moving farther down the palette you'll come across a Cropping tool, a Blendtool (for creating graduated fills), an Eye Dropper tool (for &quot;picking up&quot;foreground and background colors from an existing image), an Airbrush tool,and a Rubber Stamp tool (for picking up or cloning a sample area of animage).andP;  Additionally, Blur and Sharpen tools are used to produce focusingeffects.andM;Channels.andP;  Adobe Photoshop excels when it comes to pure image-processingwork.andP;  Image-editing tools can be used to adjust image brightness, contrast,gamma, color balance, hue and saturation.andP;  In addition, you can work on theentire color image, a selected area or single components in the image.andM;Gray-scale images have only one channel.andP;  If you are working with an RGBimage, however, you can access and manipulate the red, green and bluecomponents (channels) of that image individually.andP;  Similarly, if you areworking with an HSB image you can work with the hue, saturation andbrightness image components separately.andM;Extra channels (referred to as alpha channels) can be created for an imageand then used for special purposes such as creating masks.andM;Filters.andP;  Once you have an image to work with, Adobe Photoshop provides morethan 20 built-in Filter effects, including Sharpen, Blur, Motion Blur, AddNoise, Diffuse, Facet, Find Edges, Star Lens and Despeckle.andP;  Photoshop alsosupports &quot;plug-in filters,&quot; even those designed for its gray-scale competitorDigital Darkroom.andP;  Plug-ins are custom code files that can be accessed viamenu options merely by having them available on disk.andM;File formats.andP;  Considering Photoshop's origins, it's not surprising that awide range of file formats are supported.andP;  In addition to its own format,those supported are Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, Encapsulated PostScript,MacPaint, Thunderscan, TIFF, PICT, PICT2, Pixar's RenderMan, PixelPaint,Scitex and Targa.andP;  There is also a catch-all type called &quot;Raw&quot; that, whengiven sufficient information about a file's header length and/or image area,will make a best-guess attempt to open unrecognized file formats.andM;Photoshop also can take a file of one image level and convert it to another,such as converting color to black and white, black and white to color, grayscale to halftone, and one bit-level color image to another bit-level colorimage.andM;Output.andP;  Once you're done working with an image, Photoshop provides a numberof output options.andP;  There is, of course, the ability to create and print CYMK(cyan, yellow, magenta, black) separations.andP;  You can also export files in EPSso that they can be imported into any PostScript-compatible application.andM;Even in its pre-release state of development, Adobe Photoshop appears to be acomplete image-processing environment.andP;  And its features and structure arecapable of being expanded even further.andM;Adobe Systems Inc. is located at 1585 Charleston Road, Mountain View, Calif.andO;94039; (415) 962-2000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
