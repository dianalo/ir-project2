As of 1981, the Mid-Continent has produced 127.8tcf of gas and 18.2 billion bbl of oil, while retaining 32 tcf of gasand 1.5 billion bbl of oil in measured reserves. The 1981 US GeologicalSurvey's estimate of reserves yet to be discovered in the Mid-Continentis 44.5 tcf of gas and 4.4 billion bbl of oil. Since these estimateswere made, approximately 25% of those reserves have been found. Productionhas increased over the last several years, but has been at a rate higherthan reserve replacement, owing to the drop in footage drilled and inreserves found per foot drilled. The Mid-Continent is a mature petroleumprovince whose future years will see an overwhelming emphasis on smallfield exploration and large field exploitation. In the past 5 years,extensions of old reservoirs and the discovery of new reservoirs in oldfields have provided 88% of the newly discovered reserves. As the pricesof oil and gas rebound from their 1986 levels, they should see a gradualincrease in drilling, both in terms of total footage and in total numberof wells drilled. They should also expect fewer exploratory wells andthe reserve replacement ratio to remain low. Exploration of new frontiersin the Mid-Continent will be extremely slow in the foreseeable future.</TEXT></DOC>
