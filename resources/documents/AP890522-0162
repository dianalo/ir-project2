The conservation group noted the devastation of federal parkbeaches from the oil spill in Alaska, but said other coastal parksalso ``are fending off a distressing variety of threats thateventually may overwhelm them.''   Among the problems facing these parklands are:   _Tons of garbage and other ocean debris washing ashore onfederal searshores and parks each year, including medical wastesand unmarked chemical drums.   _Pressure for offshore oil development near the federal land.   _Wastewater pollution from nearby agriculture or urbandevelopment.   _The increasing use by park visitors of all-terrain vehiclesthat damages dunes and wildlife habitat.   _Developers who aggressively are buying private parcels of landwithin some of the parks, while the government is unable to competefor the parcels because of budget constraints.   The report by the conservation group said there are no signs theproblems facing the coastal parks will ease.   ``Tomorrow the problems facing our coastal parks will be moreserious than they are today'' unless additional measures are takento better protect these stretches of federal seashore, theWilderness Society report said.   The coastal parks and seashore areas examined were Acadia inMaine; Aniakchak, Bering Land Bridge, Cape Krusenstern, GlacierBay, Katmai, Lake Clark and Kenai Fjords in Alaska; Everglades,Biscayne, Canaveral, Fort Jefferson and Timucuan in Florida;   Assateague Island in Maryland-Virginia; Cape Cod inMassachusetts; Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout in North Carolina;Cumberland Island in Georgia; Fire Island in New York; Gateway inNew Jersy-New York;   Gulf Island in Mississippi-Florida; Hawaii Volcanoes in Hawaii;Olympic in Washington; Padre Island in Texas; Virgin IslandsNational Park; Golden Gate, Channel Islands, Gateway, Redwood,Point Reyes, Santa Monica Mountains, all in California.</TEXT></DOC>
