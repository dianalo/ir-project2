The justices said they will decide whether a government lawenforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor beinginvestigated for possible fraud certain documents received fromanother agency.   Much of the case is cloaked in secrecy _ including the identityof the contractor and the government agencies involved _ presumablyto protect the contractor's reputation.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York City,ruled last June 23 that the sought-after government documents mustbe released to the contractor. But Supreme Court Justice ThurgoodMarshall on Jan. 30 blocked any such release until the high courtconsidered the government's appeal.   The documents at issue are 1978 letters a government agency,referred to in court papers as the John Doe Agency, exchanged withthe contractor, identified as John Doe Corp., about the contractor'sbilling practices.   Those letters became relevant in 1986 during a grand juryinvestigation of possible fraudulent practices by the contractor,and they were tranferred from the John Doe Agency to a federal lawenforcement agency, identified in court papers as John DoeGovernment Agency.   The contractor under investigation filed an FOIA lawsuit in 1987seeking ``all documents that are related in any way to the subjectmatter of the (1978) correspondence.''   A federal trial judge ruled against the contractor, sayingrelease of the documents would jeopardize the grand juryinvestigation.   But the 2nd Circuit court ruled that the FOIA requires surrenderof the documents.   An exemption in the law for materials ``compiled for lawenforcement purposes'' does not apply in this case, the appealscourt said, because the letters were not originally obtained orgenerated for law enforcement purposes.   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers arguedthat the June ruling ``would seriously impair the ability ofnumerous federal agencies to conduct their law enforcementresponsibilities'' and hinder ``an important law enforcementinvestigation.''   The case is John Doe Agency vs. John Doe Corp., 88-1083.</TEXT></DOC>
