WHO said its appeal followed the recent discovery thatmalarial parasites had developed resistance to theanti-malarial drug mefloquine at the Thai-Cambodian border.That discovery was &quot;particularly disturbing as we have someevidence that these (malaria) parasites are also resistant toother drugs not yet used in the area such as halofantrine,&quot;said Tore Godal, a WHO official involved in tropical-diseaseresearch.   WHO estimates that there are 110 million new malaria casesa year but that about 270 million people may be carrying themalaria parasite; from one million to two million people dieeach year from malaria and its complications.   Dr. Godal said there is some cause for optimism. &quot;Avaccine blocking the transmission of human malaria is underdevelopment,&quot; he said. &quot;What we now need is to scale up theproduction, complete toxicological studies and start studiesin human volunteers and in the field.&quot;                                                                                                          DROP IN AIRBUS ORDERS                                                                                                          Airbus Industrie said it recorded new firm orders for 118of its commercial jets during the first half of 1990, downsharply from 252 planes in the corresponding year-earlierperiod. The European aircraft group said the year-earliertotal reflected a period of exceptionally brisk sales andinterpreted the 1990 first-half result as a sign of&quot;continuing strong demand for civil aircraft, albeit at amore reasonable level for the industry.&quot;                                                                                                          RADIO CONTROVERSY IN ISRAEL                                                                                                          An Israeli state planning board approved construction inthe Negev desert of a Voice of America radio transmitter thatenvironmentalists had fought against. Conservationists, whosay the radio emissions could be harmful and disorientmillions of migratory birds, threatened to appeal to theSupreme Court. The U.S. plans to use the transmitter to carryprograms of Voice of America and Radio Liberty to EasternEurope, Central Asia and Africa in 28 languages.

TRANS-SOVIET PROJECT                                                                                                          South Korea will participate in a $500 milliontrans-Soviet telecommunication-cable project, the state-ownedKorea Telecommunication Authority said. The consortium behindthe project now consists of 11 agencies from 10 nations,including the Soviet Union, the U.S., Japan and the UnitedKingdom. The project will link South Korea and Japan toWestern Europe via the Soviet Union.                                                                                                          PACIFIC PROTEST                                                                                                          Pacific island leaders and environmental groups areraising concerns about the U.S. Army's plan to move chemicalweapons from West Germany to Johnston Atoll, 800 milessouthwest of Honolulu. &quot;Transporting the European stockpilehalfway around the world inescapably increases the risks,&quot;said the Federated States of Micronesia. The MarshallIslands, Cook Islands, New Zealand and the U.S. territory ofAmerican Samoa also have expressed reservations about theplan. The Army said moving the weapons and destroying them atJohnston Atoll would have minimal public-health, safety andenvironmental effects.                                                                                                          EC AND MONETARY UNION                                                                                                          The wide economic differences between European Communitymembers could make it necessary for economic and monetaryunion to be phased in at different speeds within the EC, agrowing number of EC officials believe.   The EC's monetary committee presented this view in areport to a meeting of EC finance ministers. The idea'ssupporters include EC Commission President Jacques Delors,according to EC sources.   Mr. Delors insisted such an approach wouldn't mean thecreation of a &quot;two-speed Europe,&quot; a prospect opposed firmlyby Britain, among others. &quot;There is no question&quot; of atwo-tier approach, said Italian Finance Minister Guido Carli.   The approach in the committee's report calls for all ECcountries to agree simultaneously to the creation of a singleEC currency and central bank. But it would give some of thema longer time to move toward that goal.

Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs are reviving in EasternEurope after decades of repression, the World Organization ofthe Scout Movement said yesterday, after readmitting Hungaryand Czechoslovakia. . . .
