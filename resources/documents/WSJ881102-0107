Bonneville, a developer and operator of alternative energy plants, said the power plant will produce up to 80,000 kilowatts of electricity for sale to a nearby utility. Heat from the power-generation operation will be sold to Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta building-products concern, for use in its Nevada gypsum-board factory. </TEXT></DOC>
