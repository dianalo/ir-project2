The purpose of the assessmentis to obtain information of radioactivity caused by both natural andman-made in the soils such as, Ra-226, Bi-214, Pb-214, Th-228, K-40,and Cs-137. There are wide range of background radiation exists becauseof the different soils and geological conditions. Although there arewide range, average values obtained in 1987 are closely related whencompared with 1985 and 1986 PVGNS Environmental Control Program and OakRidge National Laboratory findings. The average value of K-40 was obtainedto be 21.4 pCi/gram compared to 20.6 and 19.7 in the 1985 and 1986 radiationreadings. Cesium (137), which was also abundant in most samples, wasfound to be 0.076 pCi/gram as compared to 0.21 and 0.17 for 1985 and1986 radiation monitor studies. The radioactive equilibrium was foundto exist in nearly all samples for the thorium decay series, and in mostsamples for the uranium chain.</TEXT></DOC>
