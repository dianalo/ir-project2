The government suggested giving the societies, the British equivalent of U.S. savings and loan associations, additional abilities to issue unsecured loans and offer a wider range of financial services beyond their traditional mainstay of home loans. The changes, revising a 1986 law, likely will be submitted to Parliament before Easter. Approval is expected.    British banks, however, professed to be unworried by the government's move. A spokesman for the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers predicted that the changes will have a greater impact on building societies than on banks. &quot;If the societies can offer more services,&quot; he said, &quot;big building societies will take business away from the smaller societies so that the number of societies will fall.&quot;    The changes could make the acquisition of a building society eventually attractive to a foreign bank. Foreign banks have dabbled in the British mortgage market, but so far haven't become major players.    In mid-1987, Britain's nearly 140 building societies had about #150 billion ($264.20 billion) in assets. They lent nearly #36 billion in mortgages during 1986.    Peter Lilley, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government proposed doubling societies' limit of #5,000 ($8,807) per borrower for personal unsecured loans. The Treasury also plans to let societies manage funds, including mutual funds; take equity stakes in life and general insurance companies and stockbrokerages; and offer a wider variety of banking and housing-related services.    To help building societies diversify, the government proposed a gradual relaxation of rules that oblige them to channel 90% of their loans to home buyers. By January 1993, societies would be able to lend 25% of their assets for such nontraditional purposes as commercial property development and unsecured personal loans.    Building societies had pressed the government for additional powers after seeing their share of new mortgage lending plummet to 47% in the third quarter of 1987 from 86% in the first quarter of 1986.    Industry officials contended they only could compete equally with banks in the mortgage business if they could offer house buyers other services, such as insurance and unsecured loans. The proposed doubling of the unsecured personal loan ceiling likely would make the societies strong competitors in the lucrative automobile-loan market.    The Building Societies Association generally welcomed the government's suggestions. But Mark Boleat, director general of the trade group, forecast &quot;some disappointment&quot; among societies that the ceiling for unsecured loans wasn't raised beyond #10,000 per individual. At #10,000, the higher ceiling matches overdraft loan facilities typically offered by many banks. </TEXT></DOC>
