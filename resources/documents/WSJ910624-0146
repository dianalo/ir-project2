WorldSpace Corp.'s AfriSpace unit won FederalCommunications Commission approval for an experimentallicense to launch and operate its Afristar satellite, whichwould provide radio service throughout Africa and parts ofthe Middle East.</LP><TEXT>   The company plans to launch a $40 million satellite, whichhas yet to be built, in 1993, according to company officials.The purpose of the experimental license is to show thatsatellites can be used economically to deliver radioprogramming with high-quality sound over large regions. Ifthe company proves its theory, the experimental license couldbecome permanent. But just where the service might end up onthe broadcast spectrum is uncertain until a world conferenceon spectrum allocation next year decides to set aside aportion of the airwaves for the new service.   To pick up the signals, users would need specialcar-mounted or hand-held receivers that are likely to cost asmuch as $100, according to WorldSpace. Because electricityand batteries are often scarce in much of Africa and theMiddle East, the receivers would be solar powered.   Currently, radio programs may be beamed from a satelliteto a ground station for delivery to homes via terrestrialtransmitters, but the signals often fade or are interruptedby static.   WorldSpace Chairman Noah Samara plans to market channelson his Afristar satellite to governments in Africa and theMiddle East. WorldSpace also hopes that other ventures suchas Voice of America or the British Broadcasting Corp. wouldlease satellite channels or time.   In addition, Frank Wright, chief of the FCC's frequencyliaison branch, said that the company plans to donate freesatellite capacity to the World Health Organization.</TEXT></DOC>
