Employees from hourly workers to CEOs look upon an annualwage increase as a birthright or an entitlement. Thisnewspaper reports regularly on planned wage increases forrank-and-file employees with added emphasis on increases fortop level executives.   How, why, and when was the idea of an annual wage increaseborn? I've searched management literature and found muchmaterial about how and when to give an annual increase, butnothing on why or when the idea came into existence.   It wasn't always thus.   During the Depression, my college-graduate cousin wasoffered a job with a retail catalogue firm at $25 a week. Twoweeks before he was to begin work, he received a letternotifying him that his starting salary had been cut to $20.Furthermore, the letter stated that if he didn't find thechange acceptable, he could make other career plans.   At the same time, my father received an enormous $5 a weekraise after three years without an increase. It called for afamily celebration, but nobody suggested that he might getanother raise next year or at any time in the foreseeablefuture. In those days, there was no such thing as a scheduledannual increase.   In the 1950s, when I was working for Underwood (thetypewriter company), the corporation was struggling forsurvival. For two successive years, we signed union contractswithout a wage increase; increases for all salaried employeeswere frozen for that period.   At another company, I asked an engineer, during his annualreview, what he had done to warrant an increase. &quot;Myattendance record is excellent, I've never been late, andI've finished all of my projects on time, if not ahead ofschedule.&quot;   &quot;If that is what earned you a raise, what was the companypaying you for?&quot; was my response. Being at work regularly andon time, and finishing assignments on schedule is what we areall paid for. Is such performance worthy of an automatic,guaranteed raise?   We seem to believe that the passing of a year entitles usto a raise. Has an assembly-line operator who has servedfaithfully for another year earned an increase? Has a CEO whohas survived another year earned an automatic increase? Ifcompanies want to grant &quot;years of service bonuses&quot; (andthere's nothing wrong with that concept), then employersshould give longevity bonuses.   Lest I be considered some sort of Neanderthal, let mestate that during my 40 years in industry, I never let sixmonths pass without some discussion of my performance and apossible raise. I am not opposed, in any shape, form ormanner, to wage increases. However, I don't recall when allof us started believing that an annual wage increase wassomething we were entitled to.   Wage and salary administration departments need to changetheir thinking: They should get away from budgeting automaticannual wage increases. Instead, there should be two types ofwage adjustments: inflationary wage adjustments and meritwage adjustments.   But first, there is the acid test: Can the organizationafford to give an increase? Wage increases should be based onwhat the organization can afford. However, it isunconscionable to tell rank-and-file employees that thecompany cannot afford to give a pay hike and then rewardsalaried employees -- especially top level management -- withincreases and bonuses. Either a company can afford to giveincreases for inflation and/or performance to everyone or itcan afford to give such increases to no one, including theCEO.   Inflationary wage increases should reflect currenteconomic conditions and be granted accordingly, notnecessarily on a given date, or even annually.   Merit increases should be just that: increases formeritorious performance -- not for having survived anotheryear, not for doing what one is being paid to do, butperformance above and beyond what one is paid for. That theorganization can afford to give merit increases does not meanthat every employee is automatically entitled to one. Ratherthan having managers tell employees what they did to earn amerit increase, employees should be prepared to tell theirsupervisors why they think they deserve a raise.   The employees at the social service agency were notgetting their expected annual increase (for inflation orperformance) because the agency could not afford an increasefor anyone, including the executive director.   If that action destroyed the concept of an expected annualincrease, so be it. Perhaps during these difficult economictimes, it is incumbent that we all face the realities of theeconomic world: There is no such thing as a guaranteed annualwage increase]   ---   Mr. Gittler, of Oberlin, Ohio, writes and lectures onmanagement issues. He anxiously awaits the next increase inhis Social Security check, which he will consider a meritincrease for his outstanding performance in retirement.</TEXT></DOC>
