However, when thetemperature of the element was lowered back to the room temperature aftermaking an amorphous silicon layer at 150-250{sup 0}C, its portion ofamorphous silicon became to be easily peeled off due to the stress, consequentlythe polymer film substrate could not be used on the light incident side.This invention solves the above defects by proposing a flexible amorphoussilicon or thin film solar cell with the features of using, as a substrate,a high polymer film with extremely fine metal or metal oxide islandsat least on the interface with the accumulated active layer and alsousing the opposite surface on the side of the active layer concernedas the light incident surface. Furthermore, the invention specifies thatthe above metal or metal oxide are to be alloys of silver and titaniumand others, the density of islands is to be 10{sup 6}/mm{sup 2} or moreand the difference of height of the islands is to be 100-5,000A.
