There were no other casualties in the 9 a.m. crash of the OH-58AKiowa helicopter near Nabern, 25 miles southeast of Stuttgart,according to a statement from the Stuttgart-based U.S. Army 7thCorps.   The statement identified the dead pilot as 1st Lt. Glen P.Adams, 28, who was assigned to Headquarters Company, 4th Battalion,159th Aviation, 11th Aviation Brigade, in Schwaebisch Hall, nearStuttgart. The Army could not provide his hometown.   Also killed was a West German employee of the U.S. Army, who wasa passenger on the aircraft, the statement said. His name was beingwithheld until relatives had been notified, the Army said.   Stuttgart police said the helicopter went down in an open areaafter running into tree branches in fog.   A board of officers from the U.S. Army Safety Center in FortRucker, Ala., planned to arrive Wednesday to investigate the crash,the Army said.   It was the third crash of a NATO military aircraft in less thana week.   A French Mirage jet fighter crashed on March 30 one mile from anuclear power plant in the southern state of Bavaria, killing thepilot.   A day later, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed into thesouthern town of Forst, near another nuclear power plant,demolishing three houses and killing a resident and the pilot.   The crashes increased criticism of NATO pilot-training practices.   Tens of thousands of West German protesters in traditionalEaster peace marches not only called for scrapping nuclear arms,but also protested the two crashes.   The Association for General Aviation, a West German organizationof private pilots, joined the protesters in demanding that NATOkeep its warplanes away from nuclear power plants.   On Sunday, the mass-circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaperprinted a article headlined ``This Junk Flies Over Our Heads,''accompanied by what it said was pictures of a patched-up U.S. AirForce F-16.   The newspaper quoted an unidentified U.S. employee at SembachAir Base southwest of Frankfurt as saying poor maintenance and ashortage of spare parts made U.S. F-16 planes unsafe.   The report said 110,000 low-level military practice flights wereconducted over West Germany annually by seven NATO-member airforces, including the United States.   On Tuesday, U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Pascoe said he was``greatly concerned and disturbed'' by the report. ``The UnitedStates Air Force does not fly junk,'' he said at a news conferenceat Sembach.   Pascoe said the aircraft pictured on the front page of Bild amSonntag was the shell of a F-4 that had been out of service sinceJuly 1986. He said the aircraft does not fly and was only used forbattle damage repair training.   He said the man quoted in the newspaper did not work at SembachAir Base. He said a man with the same last name worked for a fewweeks as a gate guard at the base about five years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
