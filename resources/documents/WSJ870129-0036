The suit was filed against the drug wholesaler in federal court in Pennsylvania in 1985. It alleges that the company, certain current and former officers and certain underwriters violated federal and state securities laws pertaining to offerings of Bindley Western common stock and debentures.    A company spokeswoman said officers weren't available late yesterday to comment on the settlement. In 1985's fourth quarter, the company posted net income of $1.4 million, or 21 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
