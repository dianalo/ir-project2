Much of this island and its neighbors in the eastern Caribbeanremained without water and electricity Monday, one week after Hugoand its 125-mph winds whipped through the region.   Relief from the United States and Caribbean islands that escapedHugo's destruction has poured into Puerto Rico, which Gov. RafaelHernandez Colon said sustained $1 billion in damage and caused thedeaths of seven people on the island. Earlier reports had put thedead at six.   The federal government, working with Puerto Rican officials,began distributing the $300 emergency checks to families withouthomes. By Monday, 7,000 checks had been approved, but officialswere uncertain how many people would eventually receive them.   The governor met with school superintendents and asked them totake a census of the number of families without homes. Variousgovernment estimates range from 25,000 to 53,000 of Puerto Rico's750,000 families are homeless.   Jose Bravo, director of the Federal Emergency ManagementAdministration on this U.S. Commonwealth, said the maximum aid to asingle family is $10,000 if its property is in a disaster zone. Thecapital, San Juan, and other communities on the eastern side ofthis island were declared disaster areas.   The Puerto Rico water company estimated 800,000 of Puerto Rico's3.3 million people were still without water service Monday. LuisRuiz Javier, executive director of the company, said San Juanshould be receiving water by Tuesday.   Meanwhile, people were taking water from swimming pools, bathingat fire hydrants or in the sea, and filling buckets at portabletanks distributed throughout the city. Two U.S. Navy destroyers,each carrying 10,000 gallons of fresh water, distributed water at aSan Juan harbor.   The Electric Power Authority reported it had restored power to70 percent of the island, although much of the capital remainedwithout electricity.   On the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua, the governmentreported $90 million in damages and 420 people homeless out of atotal population of 85,000.   A government emergency committee said much of the country wasleft without power, water and telephone service, but publicutilities should be restored by the weekend.   Only one death was confirmed, a 74-year-old woman who ran fromher home seeking shelter during the hurricane. Earlier, two peoplewere reported to have died.   A total of 33 to 35 people were reported killed by Hugo, whichswept through Sept. 17-18.   Aid and relief personnel were arriving from Caribbean neighborsthat escaped the storm, including Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana andJamaica. Much of the relief was for the British colony ofMontserrat, where 10 people were killed, 30 percent of the homesdestroyed and damages of $100 million were incurred.   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Coast Guard reported a storagetank at the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority was stillleaking at a rate of 42,000 gallons a day.   They said the tank, damaged by the storm, still contained 1.25million gallons, but that the oil was no longer seeping into theharbor. The Guard also said 40,000 gallons that did reach theharbor had been confined in containment booms.   Military and civilian cargo planes continued to unload reliefsupplies at St. Croix, where Hugo damaged 90 percent of the homesand left 45,000 homeless. Gov. Alexander Farrell estimates propertydamage at $500 million.   About 1,200 U.S. troops sent to quell widespread looting werehelping in the relief effort.   On neighboring St. Thomas, capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands,heavy overnight rains caused flash flooding, sending mud and waterinto some homes already hit hard by the hurricane. There were noreports of injuries from the flooding, however.</TEXT></DOC>
