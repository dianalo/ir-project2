The bank said the decision followed discussions with several community groups over its compliance with the federal Community Reinvestment Act. Federal regulators review banks' compliance with the act when they are asked to approve mergers. As bank mergers have risen in number and dimension in recent years, community groups have managed to win large concessions by threatening to delay the regulatory approval process.    The loans will be made during the next two years. The bank also agreed to create a direct-deposit checking account for low-income individuals, provide more bilingual banking services and boost purchases from minority and women suppliers.    California First is 77%-owned by the Bank of Tokyo; Union Bank is owned by Standard Chartered PLC. The merger, expected to be completed in the fall, will create a bank with about $15 billion in assets. </TEXT></DOC>
