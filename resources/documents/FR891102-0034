BackgroundThe Department of Transportation (DOT or Department) is comprised of theOffice of the Secretary (OST) and nine separate modal administrations:The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Maritime Administration(MARAD), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), theResearch and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), the St. Lawrence SeawayDevelopment Corporation (SLSDC), the Urban Mass Transportation Administration(UMTA), and the United States Coast Guard (USCG).Each of the modal administrations operates under different statutory authority;for example, some extensively regulate actions by persons within theirmode of transportation, while others do not. As discussed below in greaterdetail, the Department, through its modal administrations, already hasimplemented several programs designed to address the use and abuse of alcoholby transportation workers. The states also are active in combating theuse and abuse of alcohol; some of these efforts are funded through theDepartment.Six of the Department's modes (USCG, FAA, FHWA, FRA, RSPA, and UMTA) recentlyissued drug testing rules for members of their regulated industries (53FR 47002 et. seq., Nov. 21, 1988). The rules apply to persons performingsensitive safety- and security-related functions in commercial operations.During the drug testing rulemakings, the Department noted on numerous occasionsthat alcohol is a drug. The Department recognized its wide use, its addictivenature, and the number of transportation-related deaths and injuries thatresult every year from its abuse. However, the Department also realizedthat, for numerous reasons, the solution to the alcohol abuse problem maybe very different from that concerning other drugs, such as cocaine ormarijuana. For that reason, with one exception, the modal administrationsdid not include alcohol among the list of substances to be tested for underthe drug testing regulations. (Pursuant to a statutory mandate, the CoastGuard required post-accident alcohol testing, in an amendment to an existingrule permitting that testing. FRA had previously included alcohol in itspost-accident testing mandate and had authorized alcohol testing for reasonablecause and pre-employment.) In announcing the drug testing rules, then Secretaryof Transportation, Jim Burnley, stated that he had directed his GeneralCounsel's Office to review the Department's existing alcohol regulationsto determine if they were sufficient. The extensive press coverage of andpublic interest in the possible involvement of alcohol in the Exxon Valdezoil spill heightened the governmental interest in this area.In his June 15, 1989, testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce,Science and Technology, Secretary Skinner committed the Department to exploringfurther the need for additional regulations on alcohol use. This ANPRMis intended to elicit public comment on whether the Department's currentregulatory requirements and programs are sufficient to respond to the hazardsof alcohol use and abuse in DOT-regulated transportation industries andwhat additional action, if any, should be taken.If further rulemaking action is necessary, the Department could considera number of options that could improve safety by reducing alcohol abusein DOT-regulated transportation industries. The list that follows is notall-inclusive and options may be combined. The options include:1. Requiring employers to establish Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)that provide education on the dangers of alcohol abuse and training todetect alcohol use or impairment on the job;2. Requiring employers to set up self- and peer-referral programs designedto identify alcohol abusers and get them into rehabilitation programs,with the understanding that the identified abusers, if rehabilitation issuccessfully completed, could retain their jobs;3. Requiring alcohol testing of transportation employees similar in wholeor in part to our drug testing rules, summarized in Appendix B (e.g., preemployment,periodic, reasonable cause, post-accident and random testing);4. Requiring pre-performance testing prior to permitting an employee tooperate a vehicle or perform safety- or security-related duties (e.g.,a pilot could be tested before entering the cockpit to fly an airplane);and/or 5. (A nonrulemaking option) encouraging the states to implement safetyprograms directed at alcohol abuse and to increase their enforcement efforts.If further regulatory action is deemed necessary after a review of thecomments on this ANPRM, separate dockets will be set up and notices ofproposed rulemakings will be developed by each of the affected modal administrations.B. Major IssuesThe Department particularly desires public comment on the following issues.This list is intended only to serve as a focal point and is not exhaustive.Following the list, there is an extensive discussion of these and otherissues, and readers will note many questions throughout the document.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Are Additional Measures Necessary To Control Alcohol Abuse AmongTransportation Workers?</ITAG>How well are existing regulations and programs working? We have anecdotalreports that alcohol use is more widespread among transportation workersthan other drug abuse, but are there supportive data? Are further regulationsneeded or would other actions such as increased enforcement of existingrules be more effective?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. What Should Be Prohibited?</ITAG>If we decide that new prohibitions or new testing for alcohol is appropriate,an important issue is what use of alcohol to prohibit. Unlike some otherdrugs, alcohol is a legal substance with legally and socially acceptableuses, at least for persons over 21 years of age. The Department alreadyhas made some decisions on what to prohibit. Most of the modes regulatingcommercial transportation (FAA, FHWA, FRA and Coast Guard) have selecteda .04 percent blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level as the standard fordetermining whether a commercial operator is under the influence of alcohol,and prohibit any use of alcohol on the job. Some modes (USCG, FAA and FHWA)subject commercial operators to pre-duty abstinence periods. FHWA rulesrequire that commercial vehicle operators with any measurable BAC levelbe placed out-of-service for a 24-hour period. Recreational boaters areprohibited only from being intoxicated, which correlates generally to aBAC of .10 percent. The BAC level is a ratio of the number of grams ofalcohol per 100 milliliters of blood; for the purpose of determining BACthrough an analysis of the breath, the amount of alcohol in one part ofblood is presumed to equal the amount of alcohol in 2100 parts of expiredbreath sample (by volume).Should the department undertake to make the transportation industries alcohol-free?Is this practicable, given the fact that alcohol is a legal substance?Or should the Department target impairment on the job, which poses thegreatest danger? If so, where should the line be drawn? Should there bedifferences in this respect for different industries or occupations?<ITAG tagnum="81">3. If Further Action Is Necessary, What General Forms Should It Take?</ITAG>a. <T3>Education.</T3> Should the Department mandate employer-provided alcoholabuse training? Should educational efforts focus on convincing abusersto seek treatment or on training supervisors to identify problem drinkers?Are there data to validate the success of alcohol education programs? Whatelements are necessary for a successful program? Should educational effortsbe coupled with self- and peer-referral rehabilitation programs? Are educationalprograms more successful if coupled with increased enforcement efforts?b. <T3>Enforcement.</T3> Are the federal and state penalties for alcohol usesufficient? Are effective actions being taken to ensure compliance withalcohol restrictions? What enforcement strategies are likely to be mosteffective? What should be the roles of employers and the Federal, stateand local governments?c. <T3>Alcohol Testing.</T3> Mandatory testing programs are costly and inevitablycontroversial. The Department's recent experience with imposing mandatorydrug tests may provide some guidance, but we recognize that alcohol testingmay involve different problems.To what extent do our current drug rules serve as a viable model for alcoholtesting? What changes would be necessary to account for the differencesbetween alcohol and other drugs? Does widespread mandatory alcohol testingmake sense if we choose to prohibit intoxication or impairment as a distinctfrom all use of alcohol? The signs of alcohol intoxication are much morewidely recognized among the general population than the indicators of druguse. On the other hand, ``functional'' alcoholics can often mask signsof intoxication. Further, moderate levels of alcohol can impair certainfaculties without constituting ``intoxication.'' Would it be cost-effectiveto randomly test for alcohol intoxication? If not, should the Departmentrequire, at a minimum, post accident and reasonable cause testing for alcoholintoxication, where not already required?d. <T3>State Programs.</T3> State and local governments have extensive experiencein dealing with alcohol impairment. Testing for the presence of alcoholhas traditionally been done by State enforcement personnel (usually aspart of a stop of an individual on the highways). Some States have lawsagainst boating while intoxicated and some states have laws against flyingwhile intoxicated. Under FAA rules, crewmembers must submit to state testsupon request by a state law enforcement officer. The ability to test generallyis predicated upon establishing reasonable suspicion to stop, probablecause to test, followed by an arrest if warranted, and finally, conductinga second and more sophisticated test (which would be used as evidence).In what areas can the Department make use of the states' resources andexpertise?<ITAG tagnum="81">4. What Should Be the Consequences for an Employee Identified as UsingAlcohol on the Job, Being Under the Influence While on the Job, or ImproperlyUsing Alcohol Prior to Work?</ITAG>Should all who are found to be under the influence be removed from safety-and security-related jobs until they are rehabilitated? Should the functionthey were performing when under the influence be relevant? (e.g., fillingout paperwork at a desk?) Should an opportunity for rehabilitation be required?Are there distinctions that warrant a federal role in mandating at leastone opportunity for rehabilitation for alcohol abuse in light of DOT'sposition that such a role was inappropriate in the drug area? Rehabilitationmay be more successful for alcohol users than for at least some kinds ofdrug use. Use of alcohol is also legal for persons aged 21 and older. Shouldeither or both of these factors influence how we treat persons identifiedas alcohol abusers? What is the success rate of existing programs? Shouldthe circumstances of use (on the job, for example) be a factor in determiningwhether an employee should have a right to rehabilitation? What about thecircumstances of identification? Should self-identified problem users betreated differently? Should the level of consumption be a consideration?Should it matter whether the abuse was a cause of an accident? Should ajob be held open in the event an employee takes advantage of an opportunityfor rehabilitation?C. General Information and DefinitionsThroughout this notice, we have generally relied on or referred to theresults of many studies concerning alcohol. Parenthetical references tothese studies are included in the text; their full names are listed alphabeticallyin a bibliography in Appendix A. Copies of all of these studies have beenplaced in the rulemaking docket. It is important to note that the datawe have are not complete; often the database includes only those teststhat were performed. Tests are performed after some accidents, but notothers depending upon current regulatory requirements, the availabilityof state enforcement personnel and location and timing of accidents. Also,data are not comparable among the transportation modes, because of differencesin reporting requirements, databases and time periods. In addition, thereferenced studies generally used different parameters and are not comparableto each other. We welcome the submission of additional data from commenters.Many of the words relating to alcohol are used interchangeably in our society,which may cause some confusion. In this document, we use the terms ``intoxication'',``driving while intoxicated'' (DWI) and ``driving under the influence''(DUI) to refer to the same thing: violation of State and/or Federal BACstandards defining intoxication. ``Zero tolerance'' refers to a 0.00 BACstandard. ``Impairment'' and ``under the influence'' mean affected by alcoholingestion, without regard to a specific BAC level. An ``active alcoholic''is an current problem drinker. Some active alcoholics can successfullymask the effects of drinking and function in their jobs without detectionfor long periods of time; these people are often referred to as ``functionalalcoholics'', but may still be safety risks in transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Problem of Alcohol Use and Abuse</ITAG>A. Effect of AlcoholThe potential effects of alcohol abuse are substantial in terms of liveslost and environmental damage. It claims at least 100,000 lives annually,25 times as many as all illegal drugs combined. In 1988, slightly over47,000 deaths occurred on our nation's highways, of which 39 percent involvedan intoxicated driver or non-occupant (with BAC over 0.10%), and another11 percent where at least some alcohol was involved. (National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration, ``Drunk Driving Facts,'' July 1989).Ethanol (the psychoactive component beverages) is a central nervous systemdepressant. It has been widely recognized for years that consumption ofalcohol can degrade human performance of demanding or delicate tasks. However,there is somewhat less agreement about how much alcohol must be ingestedbefore there is a significant deterioration in performance. Studies haveindicated that the effects of alcohol vary among individuals, and, evenfor a given individual, alcohol will have varying effects depending onsuch factors as motivation, fatigue, and previous experience with alcohol(Zero Alcohol, 1987; Ryder, 1981; Landauer, 1983; Lister, 1983). One reasonfor the substantial variation among individuals is that ingestion of aspecified quantity of alcohol will not necessarily produce the same BACin two different people, even if they have the same body weight (Zero Alcohol,1987).In one study, for example, it was found that a particular body-weight-adjusteddose of ethanol could produce a range of BAC levels of .036 to .095 percent(O'Neill, 1983). In addition, alcohol appears to enter the blood streamat different rates in different people (Zero Alcohol, 1987). In anotherstudy, subjects were given controlled doses and had equal amounts of foodin their system. Nevertheless, the time required to reach the peak BAClevel varied from 15 to 90 minutes after ingestion (Wilson, 1984).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,3,3,3,3</C><T4>Alcohol Levels by Weight</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Here are blood alcohol levels based on one's weight and the amountof alcohol consumed within an hour.]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Weight</H1><H2>100</H2><H2>140</H2><H2>180</H2><H2>220</H2>Beer:<ITAG tagnum="3">1 glass </ITAG><D>.05 </D><D>.04 </D><D>.03 </D><D>.02</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2 glasses </ITAG><D>.08 </D><D>.06 </D><D>.05 </D><D>.05</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 glasses </ITAG><D>.11 </D><D>.09 </D><D>.08 </D><D>.07</D>Wine:<ITAG tagnum="3">1 glass </ITAG><D>.03 </D><D>.03 </D><D>.02 </D><D>.02</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2 glasses </ITAG><D>.06 </D><D>.05 </D><D>.04 </D><D>.03</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 glasses </ITAG><D>.08 </D><D>.06 </D><D>.04 </D><D>.04</D>Distilled spirits:<ITAG tagnum="3">1 ounce </ITAG><D>.04 </D><D>.03 </D><D>.02 </D><D>.02</D><ITAG tagnum="3">2 ounces </ITAG><D>.07 </D><D>.05 </D><D>.04 </D><D>.03</D><ITAG tagnum="3">3 ounces </ITAG><D>.09 </D><D>.07 </D><D>.06 </D><D>.05</D><F>Source National Safety Council.</F></ITAG>There are also performance differences between individuals that are unrelatedto the blood alcohol concentration. It appears, for example, that highlyskilled professionals may be better able to compensate for the physiologicaleffects of alcohol than persons who are less skilled, particularly at lowerBAC levels. In two studies comparing the effect of alcohol on the performanceof racing drivers and ordinary drivers on a closed track, the skill ofthe ordinary drivers showed some deterioration at a BAC of .05 percent,while the racing drivers showed no impairment until they had substantiallyhigher BAC levels (Forney, 1961; Lovibond, 1970). Similarly, in a comparisonof nonprofessional and professional pilots at BAC's of .04, .08, and .12percent, the nonprofessionals made numerous errors in tracking, while theprofessionals' tracking ability did not decrease even at the highest BAClevels. (Billings, 1972) (However, the study noted that the professionalpilots committed more procedural errors than normal after alcohol consumption.There may also be compounding factors, such as fatigue, that could affectresults in a real-world situation.)Under the circumstances, it must be recognized that a uniform standardwill necessarily have nonuniform effects when measured against the behaviorof specific individuals. However, this has not limited the states' abilityto define and enforce driving-under-the-influence (DUI) standards and doesnot mean that we cannot take action. Rather, it means merely that a widevariety of factors must be weighed as we reevaluate our current requirementsand consider new ones.Most States have adopted a BAC of .10 percent as the definition of intoxicationin connection with laws on driving under the influence. Some use it asa rebuttable presumption of a violation; others as a <T3>per se</T3> violation. (Several states are considering lowering theirBAC standards to .08; and a number of states are in the process of consideringadoption of the FHWA BAC standard for commercial drivers of .04.) Stateswith BAC standards for operating vessels of aircraft typically use .10percent.However, as indicated above, a number of laboratory studies have shownthat performance on some tasks can begin to deteriorate at BAC levels wellunder .10 percent (Moskowitz, 1973; Drew, 1959; Landauer, 1983). Some studieshave suggested that performance deteriorates in a linear fashion, beginningwith the lowest levels tested (Moskowitz, 1985; Drew, 1959). BAC's lowerthan .05 percent have been associated with increases in errors in tasksrequiring divided attention, and it appears that cognitive performanceis decreased for most individuals at BAC's of .04 percent or less (ZeroAlcohol, 1987; Evans, 1974). Low BAC levels have also been shown to affecta driver's stopping distance and to increase errors in steering (Laurell,1977). There is no definitive answer to how much the risk of accident occurrenceincreases as a result of the performance deficit, but some relationshipcan be assumed. Those administrations in the Department that have set allowableBAC levels for transportation workers (FAA, FHWA, FRA and Coast Guard)generally have used .04 percent as the maximum.In addition, there is some evidence that serious impairment may continueafter alcohol has been eliminated from a person's blood. National Instituteon Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-supported researchers found that ``handovereffects'' seriously impaired the performance of ten pilots on a flightsimulator for as long as fourteen hours after they consumed enough alcoholto render them legally intoxicated in most states. They showed an inabilityto prevent the plane from veering away from a straight course and to holdthe plane straight on landings. The researchers found no correlation betweenthe pilots' degree of flight experience or their subjective interpretationof their performance and the investigators' objective measurements. (AmericanJournal of Psychiatry, December 1986). BAC tests in the above situationwould be negative.A common problem is multiple substance abuse, impairment by a combinationof alcohol and other drugs. The tendency of drug or alcohol abusers toabuse other substances poses a serious danger to the travelling publicand complicates the treatment of the abuser. Combinations of substancescan have unforeseeable synergistic effects, resulting in greater impairment.We also are concerned about the propensity of users to switch from abusingone substance to abusing another depending upon what is being tested for.B. The Alcohol Problem_GenerallyThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) reportedin 1987 that, in the United States, two in every three adults drink, but10 percent of those drinkers consume half of the nation's beer, wine, andliquor. An estimated 17 million U.S. adults are alcoholics, which is aboutsix times higher than the number of cocaine users. (NIDA study, 1989).C. Costs of Alcohol Abuse to SocietyWhile it is difficult to estimate the precise cost to society from alcoholabuse, there is no doubt that the cost is enormous. The potential effectsof alcohol abuse are substantial in terms of lives lost, personal injuries,property damage, business losses (lost productivity, absenteeism, etc.)and environmental damage.According to a Research Triangle Institute study performed for the Departmentof Health and Human Services, the overall economic cost to American societyfrom alcohol abuse was $89.5 billion in 1980. This amount represents directcosts, such as medical treatment, and indirect costs, such as lost wagesand reduced productivity. In 1987, the NIAAA estimated the economic coststo society of alcohol abuse to be nearly $117 billion a year, including$18 billion from premature deaths, $66 billion in lost productivity, and$13 billion for rehabilitation. Assuming the base numbers are still thesame, inflation presumably has increased the cost in current dollars.D. Alcohol Abuse in the Transportation Industry<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>Generally, the Department's anti-alcohol abuse efforts have focused onalcohol as it affects an individual's medical qualifications; prohibitionson on-duty use and operating while under the influence, and, in certaincases, use during defined pre-duty periods; and sanctions for violationsof the Federal regulatory scheme, as well as sanctions for violations ofState alcohol laws. Thus, alcohol testing, with limited exceptions, isleft to State enforcement personnel. (Coast Guard and FRA rules providefor post-accident and reasonable cause testing. As noted above, the FAArequires crewmembers to submit to state tests upon request.) Each of thefollowing sections briefly describes the existing federal rules by modeof transportation; Appendix B describes them in additional detail. Thefollowing sections also contain data that the Department has on the alcoholproblem in each mode.We specifically invite commenters to provide any additional relevant dataor statistics about the alcohol problem in the different modes of transportation.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Aviation</ITAG>The FAA regulations prohibit a person from acting or attempting to actas an aircraft crewmember if he or she is under the influence of alcohol,or has consumed any alcoholic beverage within 8 hours of reporting forduty. They also prohibit crewmembers from flying with a BAC of .04 or higher.If a history of drug dependence, alcoholism, or mental problems is discovered,the FAA may disqualify the pilot. In 1987, the Department's Inspector General'soffice checked the National Driver Register (NDR) and records in the FloridaDepartment of Motor Vehicles; they found that nearly 8,000 FAA-certifiedpilots in Florida had been convicted of drunk-driving offenses. The FAAwas unaware of these DUI convictions because the pilots had not reportedthem to the FAA as required. The FAA recently issued a DUI enforcementpolicy and an NPRM that includes, among other matters, a process for examiningdriving records.There has never been an accident involving a transport-category U.S. aircarrier in which the probable cause was attributed to alcohol use. However,starting in the early seventies, the Air Line Pilots Association and themajor airlines, in cooperation with the FAA, developed a program to identifyalcoholic pilots, so that they could be treated and, if appropriate, returnedto duty. More than 1,200 pilots have been through this program, with arelapse rate of less than 15 percent. Since the program provides for stringentsurveillance of treated pilots, there has been no compromise of safety.Nevertheless, the existence of this extensive a program demonstrates thatthe air carrier industry is not immune to the problem of alcohol abuse.We do not have any data, however, on the costs of alcohol abuse in termsof such things as lost productivity and increased medical expenses.The number of general aviation accidents that can actually be attributedto the use of alcohol is uncertain. In the past, general aviation accidentshave usually not been investigated by the National Transportation SafetyBoard (NTSB) to determine cause. FAA accident investigations are intendedmerely to be fact-finding and do not make a finding of probable cause.We do know, however, that in 3,949 general aviation accidents occurringbetween 1978 and 1987, 239 or 6 percent of the pilots involved had BAClevels above .04 percent. However, the general pattern over those ten yearsimproved; the incidence of alcohol among private pilots involved in accidentsactually declined by 36 percent over the course of the period, from 8.3percent of all general aviation accidents in 1978 to 5.5 percent of suchaccidents in 1987.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Motor Carriers</ITAG>It is a criminal offense to operate a commercial motor vehicle (CMV), orany vehicle subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs)under the influence of alcohol or drugs. FHWA regulations prohibit theuse of alcoholic beverages within 4 hours of reporting to work and alsoprohibit a driver from working while having any measured BAC or any detectedpresence of alcohol in his or her system. This effectively amounts to azero alcohol threshold for CMV operators. A driver will not be consideredphysically qualified to drive a motor vehicle if, among other things, thedriver is currently an active alcoholic. On October 4, 1988, FHWA issuedrequirements that states must adopt regulations, whereby a commercial motorvehicle (CMV) operator convicted of having a BAC level of .04 or abovewill be deemed to be DUI and subject to a disqualification of at leastone year, or they will lose a percentage of federal-aid highway funds.These BAC regulations are integral to the commercial driver's license (CDL)program, a nationwide restructuring (under FHWA and state auspices) oftesting, licensing, and disqualification procedures for CMV operators.Mandated by the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, the CDL programincludes a national clearinghouse through which states will exchange commercialdrivers' record information, including BAC violation histories.Accident statistics indicate that nearly half of the fatally injured noncommercialmotor vehicle drivers had a measurable amount of alcohol in their blood(usually .01 percent or more) compared to about 15 percent of fatally injureddrivers of medium and heavy trucks. Moreover, as the chart below indicates,for those truck drivers who had been drinking prior to an accident, thehighest accident rate was among those consuming the most alcohol. Driversof heavy and medium trucks with positive BAC's are involved in about 750fatal crashes annually, along with another 7,700 crashes resulting in personalinjuries and 4,750 crashes involving only property damage (Zero Alcohol,1987).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,9,9</C>  <H1>  </H1><H1>Percentage of all fatal truck accidents </H1><H1>Percentage of the 15 percent of truck drivers who had alcohol in theirblood</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">No truck driver use of alcohol <D>85.0 </D><D>_</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">BAC = .10 or more <D>9.1 </D><D>60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">BAC = .04-.10 <D>2.7 </D><D>18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">BAC = .03 or less <D>3.2 </D><D>21</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>100 </D><D> </D><F>(Zero Alcohol, 1987)</F><F>(FARS data tapes, 1982-1985)</F></ITAG></ITAG>The NTSB is in the process of studying alcohol (and other drug) use bymotor carrier operators in fatal accidents. We hope to have the resultsfor consideration at the next stage of this rulemaking. We do know, however,that the cost of accidents to employers is substantial, over and abovethe lives lost, whether these accidents are caused by alcohol or somethingelse. The National Safety Council estimates that an on-the-job accidentis four times more costly than one that occurs in a personal vehicle, withan average cost to employers of $168,000 for a fatal accident and $6,900for a nonfatal accident. To the extent alcohol use increases on-the-jobaccidents, its cost impact could be quite significant.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Rail</ITAG>The FRA regulations prohibit on-the-job use of, possession of, or impairmentby alcohol or any controlled substance. They also prohibit railroad employeessubject to the Hours of Service Act from having a BAC level of .04 or morewhile on the job. This is a per se violation; however, it is used for civil,and not criminal purposes. Following innovations such as an industry programcalled ``Operation Redblock'' and the FRA's testing and rehabilitationprogram, alcohol use among railroad workers, which has always been a seriousproblem for the industry, may be in decine.However, we recognize that problems continue in this area. From February1986, when mandatory post-accident blood testing for alcohol began, throughthe end of 1988, 13 employees tested positive for alcohol (0.6 percentof employees tested). In five accidents/incidents, involving two deaths,two injuries, and $3.18 million in property damage, alcohol appears tohave played a causal role. In one, the engineer tested positive at a BAClevel of .16, and alcohol was found by the NTSB to be a contributing factorin the accident, which caused $1.58 million damage and the death of theengineer. In another accident, which is still under investigation, eightinjuries and $194 thousand in damage were caused, and a dispatcher testedpositive at .15 percent BAC. Three additional accidents so far in 1989also involved four employees who tested positive for alcohol.Reasonable cause breath testing under the FRA program (triggered by ruleviolations, less serious accidents and injuries, or reasonable suspicion)has produced the following results: 11 of 348 persons tested positive in1986 (3.2 percent); 24 of 593 tested positive in 1987 (4.2 percent) and46 of 1005 tested positive in 1988 (4.6 percent). FRA regulations definea ``positive'' breath test as one indicating a BAC level of .02 percentor above. The significance of these results with respect to prevalencein the population is difficult to determine, since a number of the testswere performed because of reasonable cause, and it should be expected thata high percentage of reasonable cause tests would be positive since prohibiteduse or impairment has already been identified or is suspected.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Maritime</ITAG>Coast Guard regulations prohibit persons from operating a vessel whileintoxicated, and merchant mariners from drinking on duty or assuming dutieswithin 4 hours of consuming alcohol. In accordance with a statutory requirement,the regulations established Federal behavioral and BAC intoxication standardsfor both commercial and recreational vessel operators. Either the behavorialor BAC standard can be used independently to determine intoxication. Therule applies a .04 percent BAC standard to operators of all commercialvessels, including fishing vessels. For recreational boaters, the FederalBAC standard is .10 percent. For recreational boaters, this BAC standardand the Federal behavioral standard apply only in the absence of existingState BAC and behavioral standards or outside of State territorial waters.The Coast Guard regulations also require post-accident testing for alcoholand other drugs.In its 1986 NPRM on operating a vessel while intoxicated, the Coast Guardstated that alcohol use has had an adverse effect on marine safety. Itexamined commercial vessel casualty records, which indicated that 44 deaths,3 persons missing, and 33 injuries were attributable to alcohol duringthe period of January 1981 through May 1986. During the period 1982 through1984, the Coast Guard took suspension and revocation action against 72seamen for alcohol-related incidents.Recreational boating casualties are much higher than commercial vesselcasualties, second only to U.S. highway deaths as a cause of transportationdeaths. They have been dropping in recent years, due to increased effortsin the cooperative safety programs of the Coast Guard, the states, andvolunteer safety organizations. In 1988, 946 boating fatalities occurred,down from the previous record low of 1,037 in 1987. (Coast Guard report,``Boating Statistics 1988''). Studies conducted by the Coast Guard andthe NTSB indicated that up to 50 percent of all recreational boating fatalitiesmay have been alcohol-related.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Pipeline</ITAG>RSPA has no specific regulations on alcohol. It does have a general regulationon health of pipeline workers at liquified natural gas plants. Pipelineoperators must look for any physical condition that would impair performance,including any observable disorder or condition that is discoverable bya professional examination. We have no specific data on alcohol-relatedaccidents or lost productivity data in this area; however, a number ofthe commenters in the anti-drug rulemaking seemed to believe that alcoholwas a more pervasive problem than drugs. We are also aware that many companiesin the industry are known to have alcohol prevention programs, but we donot have statistics or data on the prevalence of the problem in the industry.Although we recognize that most accidents are caused by excavation workers(people not regulated by RSPA) digging into pipelines, we would like togather data on whether alcohol abuse does or can cause safety problemsin the pipeline industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Mass Transportation</ITAG>UMTA does not have any regulations concerning alcohol. However, many ofUMTA's grantees are subject to other Federal requirements on alcohol use.All commuter rail lines funded by UMTA, for example, are subject to FRAregulations. All drivers of UMTA-funded motor vehicles that are capableof carrying more than 15 passengers, including the driver, are subjectto the FHWA DUI standards which are enforced by the states.Data available to UMTA indicate that approximately 50 commuter train accidentsin the last 13 years have been attributed to drug-or alcohol-impaired workers,and, in the last three years, 15 percent of employees tested followingcommuter train accidents tested positive for drugs or alcohol. (The datado not provide separate figures for alcohol alone.) In informal implementationdiscussions following adoption of the UMTA anti-drug rulemaking, some industrymembers have indicated that they believe alcohol is a more serious problemthan drugs. One of the few surveys taken indicated that, between 1982 and1985, only five out of 1,210 bus drivers tested positive for alcohol followinga fatal accident. However, information originating from industry sourcesindicates that transit bus drivers are heavier drinkers than the generalpopulation (U.S. Census Bureau, 1984b). One survey is reported to havefound that 57 percent drink at least weekly, with an average consumptionof nine drinks per week; the national median is six drinks per week (U.S.Census Bureau, 1984b). No information is available about drinking on thejob (Zero Alcohol, 1987).At this time, we do not have any useful data on the other costs of alcoholabuse, such as lost productivity and absenteeism, and we again invite commentersto supply information on these matters. We specifically request additionaldata relating to the problem of alcohol abuse and use in each mode of transportation.We particularly want commenters to address whether the current rules andprograms are sufficient and, if not, why. We welcome suggestions on areaswhere further action is necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Legal Authority/Issues</ITAG>An analysis of the Department's authority to adopt any of the options discussedin this ANPRM would vary with the specific option.The option that may be considered the most intrusive would be a requirementto conduct alcohol testing. For that reason, we discuss that option here.If further rulemaking is deemed warranted, in subsequent documents, ouranalysis will address the option or options selected.As a general matter, the legal authority, both statutory and constitutional,to mandate any alcohol testing would be the same as that relied upon toissue the drug testing rules, except the Coast Guard also has a statutorymandate to conduct post-accident alcohol testing. Although the existingcase law addressing the constitutionality of employee alcohol testing programsis more sparse than that with regard to drug testing, the Department believesthat the available precedent supports rulemaking efforts that may requirealcohol testing in the regulated transportation industries.As courts have held with regard to government drug testing of employees,alcohol testing mandated by the government is considered a search withinthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. See, <T3>Schmerber</T3> v. <T3>California</T3>, 384 U.S. 757, 767-768 (1966) (``compelled intrusionsinto the body for blood to be analyzed for alcohol content'' must be considereda Fourth Amendment search); <T3>Skinner </T3>v. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association</T3>, 489 U.S.   , </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">  , 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1412 (1989) (``Subjecting a person to a breathalyzertest, which generally requires the production of alveolar or `deep lung'breath for chemical analysis * * * implicates similar concerns about bodilyintegrity and, like the blood-alcohol test * * * considered in Schmerber,should also be deemed a search.'')In determining whether a particular search comports with Fourth Amendmentrequirements, courts must establish that under all the particular circumstancesthe search itself is ``reasonable.'' As the leading case on bodily fluidtesting, <T3>Skinner </T3>v. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association</T3>, makes clear, issuance ofa warrant or the existence of probable cause or individualized suspicionis not a minimum essential requirement in establishing the reasonablenessof a search under an administrative testing program.In Skinner, the Supreme Court upheld regulations issued by the FederalRailroad Administration governing drug and alcohol post-accident and reasonablecause testing of railroad employees (49 CFR part 219). The Court concludedthat the testing procedures and methods of procuring blood, breath, orurine samples for testing as set forth in Subparts C and D of the FRA regulations``pose only limited threats to the justifiable expectations of privacyof covered employees.'' 489 U.S. at   , </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">  , 109 S.Ct. at 1417, 1419. By contrast, the Court found that thegovernment's interests in seeking to determine the cause of an accidentor incident, deterring alcohol and illegal drug use by rail employees,and safeguarding the general public are compelling. Under these circumstances,the Court held that alcohol and drug testing pursuant to the FRA regulationsare reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Also, the lack of a demonstrated substance abuse problem among the workforcein a particular industry should not, of itself, pose insurmountable constitutionalimpediments to a testing program for that workforce. This point was madeclear by the Supreme Court in <T3>National Treasury Employees Union </T3>v. <T3>Von Raab</T3>, 489 U.S.   ,   , 109 S.Ct. 1384 (1989), which was decidedthe same day as Skinner. In Von Raab, the Court upheld urinalysis testingfor illegal drugs of U.S. Customs Service employees slated for promotionsinto positions that involved either interdicting illegal drugs or carryinga firearm. Despite the Commissioner of Customs' stated belief that ``Customsis largely drug-free,'' the Court concluded that there was little reasonto suspect that the Customs Service was ``immune'' from society's pervasivedrug abuse problem and held that the testing program was constitutionallydefensible as a means to ensure that employees promoted to these sensitivepositions are drug-free. <T3>Id</T3>., 489 U.S. at   ,   , 109 S.Ct. at 1387, 1395.Pre-Skinner court decisions addressing the constitutionality of variousemployee alcohol testing programs have also concluded that such testingcomports with the Fourth Amendment. Thus, a state regulation requiringjockeys to submit to mandatory warrantless breath alcohol tests on eachracing day was found to be constitutionally permissible. <T3>Shoemaker</T3> v. <T3>Handel</T3>, 795 F.2d 1136 (3d Cir.), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 479 U.S. 986 (1986). Similarly, alcohol and drugtesting during a pre-employment physical examination, work-related examination,return to work after unscheduled absence, or on the basis of reasonablesuspicion or involvement in an accident or incident was upheld in the caseof mass transit employees directly involved in the operation, maintenanceand decisionmaking of a public transit system. <T3>Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 933</T3> v. <T3>City of Oklahoma City</T3>, 710 F. Supp. 1321 (W.D. Okla. 1988). <T3>Accord, Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1279 </T3>v. <T3>Cambria County Transit Authority</T3>, 691 F. Supp. 898 (W.D. Pa. 1988)(mandatory drug and alcohol testing during annual physical examinationdoes not violate Fourth Amendment).Also, DOT is aware of at least one recent Federal appellate court caseupholding employee alcohol testing in the wake of Skinner. In that case,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld, <T3>inter alia</T3>, random breathalyzer testing of mass transit operatingemployees. <T3>Transport Workers Union, Local 234 </T3>v. <T3>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</T3>, 863 F.2d 1110(3d Cir. 1988), <T3>vacated and remanded</T3>, 109 S.Ct. 3209 (1989), <T3>aff'd on remand sub nom. United Transportation Union </T3>v. <T3>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</T3>, 884 F.2d 709(3d Cir. 1989).Consistent with the Supreme Court's analysis in Skinner and Von Raab andlower court decisions, if the Department determines that there is a needfor properly-administered alcohol testing to ensure that employees in transportationindustries are not impaired while performing sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunctions, that need would outweigh the privacy interests of these employeesand, thus, would be constitutionally permissible.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. International Issues</ITAG>We are aware that any decision to issue regulations requiring alcohol testingor some of the other options discussed in this ANPRM is certain to raisequestions about compatibility with the laws of foreign countries. Our drugtesting requirements have already resulted in government-to-governmentconsultations, which we believe will ultimately result in mutually satisfactoryarrangements. Nevertheless, it would be useful, even at this early stageof our analysis, to understand more about how other countries whose transportationindustries operate in the U.S. or perform sensitive safety or security-relatedwork for U.S. operators outside the U.S. view the problem of alcohol useand abuse among transportation employees, how they respond to the problem,whether they conduct any alcohol testing and how those programs operate.We specifically invite comments on those situations where our regulationsmight have an international effect. Among other things, it should be notedthat Annex 2 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the ChicagoConvention), section 2.5, states that no person shall pilot or act as aflight crewmember while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor orany narcotic drug ``by reason of which his capacity to so act is impaired.''It is the U.S. government's intention to work with foreign governmentsto resolve potential conflicts in a manner that accommodates their concernswhile ensuring the necessary level of safety by those we regulate.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Questions of Approach</ITAG>A. IntroductionIf we determine that further action against alcohol abuse is necessary,there are several alternative approaches that we are considering. Theycould be adopted singly or in combination. As a preliminary matter, wefirst discuss who should be covered by any program we set up, which isrelevant to all but the enforcement options. A discussion of each alternativeand questions that each poses then follows. We welcome public commentson these alternatives. We also welcome public comment on any other approachesthat the Department could take to address the alcohol problem in the transportationindustry.B. Covered EmployeesOur modal drug rules generally cover persons who perform sensitive safety-or security-related functions in commercial transportation. They affectapproximately 4 million persons and include, for example, commercial truckdrivers, pilots, pipeline operators, licensed and documented mariners andothers serving on board a vessel with a licensed operator, mass transitoperators, and railroad workers subject to the Hours of Service Act. (Seethe end of Appendix B for a short summary of the drug regulations.) TheDepartment's existing alcohol regulations cover a somewhat different population.Chart 1 provides a general description of the types of people covered bythe drug regulations.The basis for imposing any requirements concerning alcohol abuse wouldbe sensitive safety- or security-related functions. It would appear thatthe same employees who could cause safety problems if they are on drugscould cause problems through misuse of alcohol.What, if any, rationale is there for covering a different population foralcohol testing than drug testing? In addition, we would like public commenton whether the line we drew between commercial operations and private operationsfor the drug rules should be changed with respect to alcohol? If so, why?Would the answers to these questions be different if the Department requiredaction other than testing? Why? C. The OptionsThe specific options include:<ITAG tagnum="81">1.

There is some disagreement about the respective effectivenessof education vis-a-vis enforcement. Some researchers claim that educationis more effective in preventing alcohol abuse than apprehension of theabuser. The American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safetycompared eight states that adopted tougher drunk driving laws with sixthat did not. The new laws had no effect at all on traffic fatalities.The Foundation attributes the overall decline in U.S. traffic-related deathsbetween 1980 and 1985 to public awareness campaigns by such groups as MothersAgainst Drunk Driving (MADD). A Boston University researcher similarlyconcluded that social pressure and publicity ``may be as important as governmentregulations in reducing drunk driving and fatal crashes.'' (Both quotedin USA Today, Wednesday, August 3, 1988.) However, would social pressurehave less effect on commercial operators who face economic pressures tocomplete their jobs?These studies have been criticized as poorly designed and misleading, sinceeducation programs were never isolated as an independent variable for comparison.NHTSA believes that the most effective programs are those that combineeducation and enforcement. Public information and education programs, inthe absence of enforcement or sanctions activities, have never been shownto impact alcohol-related fatal crashes. Conversely, scores of studieshave found that programs involving enhanced enforcement, roadside sobrietycheckpoints and the use of sanctions such as license suspensions frequentlyhave resulted in significant reductions of alcohol-related fatalities.Although there is disagreement on the effectiveness of education alone,it appears that using education as an adjunct to deterrent measures wouldmake them more effective.Education may be less effective for illegal drugs, because the users havealready decided to do something illegal. Having crossed over that line,they may be less susceptible to educational efforts. For that reason, alcoholabuse may warrant a different response from the approach the Departmenttook to illegal drug use.b. <T3>Employee Assistance Programs.</T3> One method of preventing, as wellas encouraging the voluntary cessation of, alcohol abuse is to establishan Employee Assistance Program (EAP). An EAP can have education, trainingand rehabilitation components that benefit both management and employeesand can be positive factors in determining the employee acceptance of andsuccess of an anti-alcohol abuse program. The Department's own EAP offerseducation and training for its employees and supervisors. The drug testingrules all require companies regulated by the Department to provide informationto employees on the dangers of drug use and the consequences of that use.In addition, supervisors are required to be trained in the detection ofdrug use among employees. Similar requirements could be imposed with respectto alcohol use and abuse.We would expect to find that the additional cost of adding informationabout alcohol to the existing drug prevention programs would be relativelysmall. We ask for public comment on whether this would be a useful approach.Also, how often should training be required and for whom? It would be helpfulif any data on the success or failure of educational efforts could be provided.Finally, we would like any data on costs, especially for programs thatare added to existing drug programs.c. <T3>Drug Free Workplace Programs.</T3> The Federal government recentlyenacted rules (54 FR 4946, January 31, 1989) that apply to its contractorsand grantees as a result of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Pub. L.100-690, title V, subtitle D). These rules require that grantees and contractors(1) certify that they will provide a drug-free work environment; (2) establisha written drug-free workplace policy; (3) inform employees about the consequencesof drug use and about any resources to assist those employees with drugabuse problems; (4) notify the government if an employee is convicted ofa criminal drug offense occuring in the workplace; (5) take action (disciplinaryaction or rehabilitation) with respect to a convicted employee.Given the fact that the Department already requires a drug free workplacefor its grantees and contractors, could a similar program for alcohol beinitiated for companies regulated by the Department? (Many of our regulatedcompanies would also be covered by the drug free workplace requirementsif they also are contractors or grantees of federal agencies.) What shouldthe elements of such a program be? Could alcohol easily be added to existingindustry drug-free workplace programs? Should alcohol be treated as anentirely separate issue requiring separate programs? What, if any, arethe problems associated with implementation? For grantees that also areregulated by the Department (e.g., UMTA grantees), could this serve asa cost effective program? Would it be cost effective for persons and companiesnot now subject to the drug free workplace rules? Who should be subjectto such a requirement? Would the rule be enforceable? Effective? In someregulated industries, such a certification would be viable; in others itmay not. Commenters should address how it could work or would not workin particular industries. Is a conviction reporting requirement practical?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rehabilitation</ITAG>a. <T3>General.</T3> We believe that both employers and employees benefitfrom the availability of rehabilitation programs. The opportunity for rehabilitationcan encourage employees to seek help and increase their overall acceptanceof an anti-alcohol program. Employers benefit from greater productivity,fewer accidents, and lower turnover costs if employees are rehabilitated.b. <T3>Employer-mandated Programs. </T3>One approach would be to encourageor require employers to offer rehabilitation opportunities to their employees.The Department decided that it would be inappropriate for the federal governmentto mandate employer-provided drug rehabilitation in its modal drug testingrules and that this issue should be worked out between employers and employees.However, as an employer, the Department provides such services. It offersa one-time opportunity for rehabilitation (usually paid for by the employee'shealth insurance) for employees who test positive under its internal drugtesting program. The employees eventually can be reinstated if they successfullycomplete rehabilitation and undergo subsequent monitoring. Counseling andrehabilitation opportunities are also provided to any DOT employees whoseek help for alcohol problems.Is there any justification for requiring employers to provide rehabilitationfor alcohol abusers, but not for drug users? If so, please explain why.Should rehabilitation be offered to those who volunteer or those who getcaught or both? Would required rehabilitation, by removing the incentivefor self-referral, only ensure that the alcohol abuse continues until theviolator is caught or causes an accident? Would education work effectivelywithout rehabilitation? Would education work if the Department encouraged,but did not mandate, rehabilitation?c. <T3>Expansion of Rehabilitation Programs Like ``Operation Redblock'' toOther Modes. </T3>To be effective, it appears that ``providing an opportunityfor rehabilitation'' means holding the same or similar job open for theemployee. The railroad industry's voluntary program called ``OperationRedblock'' is designed to identify substance abusers and get them intorehabilitation programs, with the understanding that persons who completethe program successfully will retain their jobs. The program relies onvoluntary self-referral (where the employee agrees to seek help beforean on-duty alcohol violation, based on his or her own initiative or anEAP contact by a family member or other concerned person), and peer-referral(where the co-worker notes on-the-job alcohol use and identifies the useras unsafe to work with). Employees have a natural reluctance to reporton a friend when it means that the friend could lose his or her job. BecauseOperation Redblock allows employees to bypass disciplinary rules, one importantaspect of the program is that it helps overcome this reluctance. OperationRedblock also includes an opportunity for treatment even where the employee'salcohol or drug use is detected through management action; but this isa special ``incentive provision'' offered in exchange for employees' activeparticipation, through prevention committees, in rule enforcement. As such,it may be more appropriate for negotiation between employer and employeethan as a regulatory requirement.A somewhat similar alcohol prevention program for airline pilots is runby the Air Line Pilots Association and many of the major airlines. Also,Coast Guard regulations allow licensed personnel to voluntarily deposittheir license, certificate or document and seek drug or alcohol rehabilitationprior to being subjected to a suspension or revocation proceeding for intoxicant-relatedincompetence. (This option is unavailable if the person caused an accident.)The document will not be returned until the individual successfully completesa rehabilitation program and participates in a post-rehabilitation monitoringprogram.Through some combination of regulation and promotion of voluntary efforts,these types of programs could be used in all transportation industriesin order to encourage more people to step forward and receive help. Itis more likely to result in the employee seeking early treatment. A criticalissue is when the opportunity for treatment will be offered. If an individualknows that he or she automatically will be provided rehabilitation aftertesting positive, he or she may have no incentive to volunteer before beingdetected or causing an accident. Of course, peer referral may not be possiblein some transportation operations (e.g., segments of the trucking industry).We ask for public comment on how successful this approach is in the industrieswhere it is used. Is it appropriate for all modes of transportation? Forsmall companies as well as large? What could be done for owner-operators?Would this approach be successful with respect to persons who abuse bothalcohol and other drugs? Would it be appropriate for the Department torequire such a program in light of the fact that it did not think it appropriateto do so in the drug testing rules? We are especially interested in dataon current rehabilitation efforts by transportation employers: the costof the program, the success rate, specific implementation problems, andso forth.d. <T3>Implementation Issues. </T3>If we pursued the rehabilitation option,should we mandate the particulars of a rehabilitation program? Who shouldpay for inpatient rehabilitation and the subsequent monitoring program?Should an employee continue to be paid while undergoing rehabilitation?What would be the economic costs of holding the job open? Would this bean impossible option for small companies? Should they be exempt or wouldthat have adverse effects? How much time should an employee be allowedto complete a rehabilitation program, taking into account how long it maytake an employee to be admitted into one? We are interested in commentson how to implement opportunities for rehabilitation among small companiesand owner-operators.e. <T3>Medical Review Officers. </T3>The kind of rehabilitation program needed(inpatient, outpatient or counseling/abatement) will necessarily vary fromcase to case. Who should make that determination? Under the drug rules,employers are required to appoint or designate a Medical Review Officer(MRO) to review the results of the employer's drug testing program, interpreteach confirmed positive test result, and evaluate an individual who hasundergone rehabilitation before he or she can return to the job. Shoulda similar requirement be included in any alcohol rule requiring or permittingrehabilitation? How would an MRO ``verify'' a positive in an alcohol case?Should an MRO have to be a licensed medical doctor or other substance abuseprofessional? Are there distinctions between the necessary qualificationsfor an MRO in the drug area and one in the alcohol area? The MRO couldbe a currently employed company physician or could be a private physicianwho performs MRO service for the employer on a contractual basis.D. Enforcement<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General.</ITAG>The Department relies mainly on the states to enforce its highway and maritimeregulations against persons operating while intoxicated. In recent years,it has encouraged greater enforcement efforts by the states against alcoholand other drug abuse. NHTSA has several programs to provide financial andtechnical assistance to states for improving laws and programs to combatalcohol- and drug-impaired driving. As discussed in Appendix B, FHWA andNHTSA have regulations that require states to adopt minimum BAC standardsfor commercial motor vehicle operators and to implement the minimum age21 drinking age law, respectively, or face the loss of some federal funding.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effectiveness of Deterrent Actions</ITAG>Enforcement is the most important deterrent activity, when accompaniedby sufficient public visibility. For example, if motor vehicle DWI offendersare not arrested, no sanctions can be imposed and no deterrence can occur.However, even if there is an increase in enforcement, this does not ensurethat deterrence will result, since the public may not be sufficiently awareof such efforts.The effectiveness of enforcement efforts has been recently summarized byVoas and Lacey (1988) and the effectiveness of roadside checkpoint operationshas been summarized by Dickman (1987). Highly visible enforcement, particularlythe frequent use of roadside sobriety checkpoints, has frequently, butnot always, resulted in reductions in alcohol-related fatal crashes orin surrogate measures. Many of the examples of such reductions have beenin foreign countries (Ross 1973; Ross 1984; Homel 1986; Ross 1988). Inthe United States, positive results have been documented for programs inLargo/Clearwater, Florida (Lacey et al. 1986); Charlottesville, Virginia(Voas, Rhodenizer and Lynn 1985); Arizona (Epperlein 1986); Stockton, California(Voas and Hause 1987) and Bergen County, New Jersey (Levy, Shea and Asch1987). Additional evidence for the deterrent effects of roadside checkpointshas been provided by Williams and Lund (1984), who found that drivers perceivedhigher enforcement levels in areas where checkpoints were used than inareas where they were not used, even though actual arrest rates were sometimeshigher in the latter. As a rule, 15-30 percent reductions in alcohol-relatedfatal crashes have been documented in the above studies. Most of the observedreductions were temporary in nature, primarily because the enforcementefforts, themselves, were short-term. However, it would be improper tocriticize enforcement programs for providing only temporary reductionswhen these programs have more frequently resulted in ``bottom-line'' reductionsin crashes than any other approach. Further, the ongoing roadside checkpointprogram in New South Wales, Australia (Homel, Carseldine and Kearns 1988)has demonstrated that long-term reductions in alcohol-related fatal crashescan be effected with long-term enforcement emphasis.The deterrent effects of sanctions have been reviewed by Voas (1986), Peck,Sadler and Perrine (1985) and by Nichols and Ross (1988). Nichols and Rossreviewed studies of the specific and general deterrent effects of confinement,license suspensions, fines and, to some extent, treatment programs. Theyconcluded that all sanctions provided some evidence of impact but thatlicense actions provided consistent evidence of both specific and generaldeterrence effects. With regard to the effectiveness of license suspensionson offenders who receive them, several controlled studies found that licensesuspensions have a significant impact on a variety of traffic safety measures,including subsequent total convictions, total crashes, alcohol-relatedcrashes, non-alcohol-related crashes and serious injury and fatal crashes(e.g. Hagen 1977; Popkin et al. 1983; Blomberg, Preusser and Ulmer 1987;and Preusser, Blomberg and Ulmer 1988). In addition, several controlledstudies provided evidence of a general deterrent impact, as reflected bypopulation-wide reductions in alcohol-related fatal crashes (e.g. Blomberg,Preusser and Ulmer 1987; Ross 1987; Zador et al. 1988; Klein 1989). Theresults of these studies provide reasonably sound evidence that the deterrenteffects of license suspensions extend beyond those offenders who are caughtand sanctioned. Nichols and Ross speculated that this was at least partiallybecause license actions are feared more by DWI offenders than any othersanctions. Nearly all of the studies that found reductions in crashes followingan increase in the use of license sanctions were studies of administrativelicense suspension laws. This suggests that the certainty of imposing licenseactions is also likely to be an important factor.In summary, it is likely that the effect of the arrest itself results inreduced drunk driving among those offenders who are caught. Further, enhancedenforcement efforts can extend such deterrent effects beyond offenderswho are caught. In addition, it appears that the imposition of licensesanctions (and to a lesser extent jail sentences) on offenders who arecaught results in reductions in their recidivism rates beyond those causedby arrest. Much of the reduction in recidivism among offenders receivinglicense actions appears to be due to reduced exposure, rather than deterrenceitself. However, since frequently-imposed license sanctions, like highvisibility enforcement, have been shown to reduce alcohol-related fatalcrashes on a population-wide basis, a significant element of deterrencemust also be operative.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The National Driver Register</ITAG>The National Driver Register (NDR) is a central, computerized index ofstate reports on drivers whose driving privileges have been denied, suspendedor revoked. Applications for driver licenses in many states are routinelychecked against the NDR to screen for potential problem drivers. In 1986,Congress enacted legislation to require a uniform national commercial driver'slicense to end a driver's ability to obtain a license in one state afterlosing one in another. The Commercial Driver's License Information System,which is tied in with the NDR, enables the states to check commercial driver'slicenses by computer.Recent legislation has expanded the role of the NDR to allow FAA and therail industry to use it to locate and review individual driving recordsto screen qualifications of airline pilots and locomotive engineers. Theinformation would be used as an indication of a possible alcohol abuseproblem, as well as evidence of any misrepresentation on their FAA medicalapplications. The FAA and FRA are currently considering regulations thatwill implement this legislation. The Department also has proposed legislationthat would authorize the Coast Guard to use the NDR to obtain informationon driving-records violations of merchant mariners.Should the Department seek access to the NDR for the other modes of transportation?Would information on convictions be useful for identifying possible alcoholabusers in sensitive safety jobs not requiring a Federal license? Are thereadditional steps that the Department could and should take to increaseenforcement of the existing regulations? Should additional legislationbe sought as incentives for additional state or local action in lieu ofor as a supplement to the other alternatives discussed in this ANPRM? Whatwould be the advantages of such an approach and what would its impact beon federalism? How can the Department best make use of the states' expertiseand position in the field to increase enforcement?<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Alcohol Testing Program</ITAG>Under this option, employers would be required to institute alcohol testingprograms, perhaps similar to our drug testing programs. However, the drugprograms focus on illicit use and controlled substances, and thus presentdifferent issues than would an alcohol testing program. In some ways, theissues raised by an alcohol program could prove to be more difficult thanthose of drug testing. They are more complicated simply because alcoholis a legal substance.Below, we discuss a series of issues and raise questions for commentersto address. These are relevant to pursuing this option.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. What to Prohibit?</ITAG>An important issue is what use of alcohol to prohibit. In addition to currentrestrictions, the Department could prohibit: (1) Any use affecting work,reflected by the presence of any alcohol in a covered employee's bloodduring working hours; or (2) impairment and/or intoxication on the job,as expressed by given BAC levels or behavior; or (3) a combination of bothfor different employees or different situations.Drug testing rules target drug usage by employees, regardless of whetherthe use occurred on- or off-duty. This makes sense because the drugs wetest for are illegal and no one yet has developed the capability to determine,based exclusively on a chemical test, at what level a particular drug impairsthe user's performance of a particular function and can have devastatingsafety consequences. Our current alcohol rules target both use and impairmentby prohibiting the employee from drinking on the job or just prior to reportingto work, or from performing a safety-related function under the influenceof alcohol identified by a certain BAC level. Data relating body fluidconcentrations of alcohol to performance decrements is more extensive thanthat available for drugs.Should we expand testing for alcohol beyond the current FRA, Coast Guard,and FAA (consent to testing) rules? If we decide to test, would the approachwe took with our modal drug rules be appropriate? That is, should the Departmentundertake to make transportation workers alcohol-free? Is this practicable,given the fact that alcohol is a legal substance? Is it necessary, or doesthe accident record indicate that an absolute prohibition would be a caseof over-regulation? If ``zero'' is an unrealistic or unnecessary goal,where should the line be drawn? We would like to hear from companies thatprohibit alcohol consumption by their employees on how they enforce thisprohibition and whether their programs are successful.The issue of being under the influence of, or impaired by, alcohol is morecomplicated than simply having drugs in one's system. To be legally relevant,the use or impairment must occur in the context of job performance. Drinkingduring most off-duty periods may or may not impinge upon a person's abilityto function well in the job, but generally by itself is not illegal. Focusingour efforts on detection of alcoholics would not be sufficient to addressthe problem. Drinking that causes on-the-job impairment poses a seriousdanger whether or not the drinker is an alcoholic.What function the person is performing is important. Finding a BAC levelof .04 in an aircraft pilot who is on duty but simply filling out administrativepaperwork in an office may be irrelevant to safety; i.e., the effects onhis ability to perform paperwork are not related to safety. Therefore,we might only want to test pilots when they are about to enter or leavethe cockpit as opposed to when they are performing administrative duties.Such a requirement could complicate the logistics of testing, especiallyfor those people that move in and out of safety-sensitive functions duringthe workday.Should testing be limited to those times when the employee is about toperform or is performing a safety function? What are the likely implementationproblems? Would it be too difficult to set up a program to randomly testpilots, for example, when they were about to perform or were performingsensitive safety functions?Do different functions demand different standards? For example, shouldwe continue to have different rules for commercial versus private operators?What about different job categories_should a pilot be held to a higherstandard (i.e., a lower BAC) than a flight attendant or a dispatcher?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. What is a Positive? </ITAG>If the Department were to require industry testing programs for alcohol,one of the most difficult issues to decide would be what blood level ofalcohol would constitute a ``positive'' test. The consensus of DOT rulesand practice would appear to support, as a measure of intoxication, a <T3>per se</T3> prohibited level of .04 percent. (It should be noted thatFRA leaves a conservative margin of error of about .01 percent for fieldtesting. Thus, the effective <T3>per se</T3> level is .05 percent.) However, some current rules implya tighter standard. For example, FAA prohibits crewmembers from drinkingless than eight hours before flight. To enforce this rule, the FAA mightwant to set a lower BAC on a ``positive'' level, on the theory that someoneat a given BAC level had imbibed within the eight-hour period. Others might argue that .04 is too strict a standard, that it would havethe effect of outlawing alcohol since it is difficult to establish withcertainty how long alcohol will stay in a particular individual's system.Still others would argue that the permissible level needs to vary dependingon, for example, whether an individual is about to fly an aircraft or fillout paperwork. In its comments on the FHWA rulemaking that established the .04 BAC standardfor driver disqualification, the NTSB recommended that a zero BAC levelbe used as the standard, because lower BAC levels have some impairmenteffects. FHWA accommodated this position by requiring that commercial motorvehicle operators with any measured BAC standard be placed out-of-servicefor the next 24 hours. We do not intend to reopen the issue of whetherspecific modal standards established for use within the existing regulatoryframework should be revisited. However, in the context of considering additionalregulatory action, including the possibility of additional testing requirements,we do believe that it is necessary to consider the appropriate BAC levelto be used under the different alternatives. What constitutes impairment? What impairment effects do hangovers have?How can we detect this type of impairment? Should we try? Moreover, howcan we avoid establishing a program that encourages ``binge'' drinkinga sufficient number of hours before work to avoid positive BAC tests, butthen results in the adverse effects of hangovers? Commenters should addresshow a program should be structured and what BAC cutoff should be applied.Commenters should also discuss whether sanctions should differ for differentBAC levels. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Treatment of Positives </ITAG>Finding alcohol abuse by an individual performing a safety-sensitive functionraises questions about how to treat that individual. Because alcohol isa legal substance, the questions may warrant different answers from theones that would be given concerning a similar individual who had used drugs.The answers also would depend upon what use of alcohol we prohibit. Themajor issues that would have to be confronted include: Should any actiontaken against an individual who tests positive depend on_or vary with_whetherthe individual is performing sensitive safety functions when tested? Shouldthe consequences of testing positive be different for persons known tobe chronic abusers versus persons caught under the influence one time?How could dependency on alcohol be accurately determined? Should the employeemerely be kept out of the sensitive safety job until sober? Or should rehabilitationbe required for every person testing ``positive'' before that person couldbe returned to the job? Should action vary depending on how high the BAClevel is? How should we treat persons who suffer from multiple addictionto both alcohol and drugs? <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Occasions/Grounds for Testing </ITAG>a. <T3>General.</T3> In the Department's drug testing rules, we required preemployment,periodic, reasonable cause, post-accident and random tests (special testingalso is required for rehabilitated employees). Depending upon what usewe prohibit, alcohol testing, unlike drug testing, may not be the mosteffective means of detecting abuse in all circumstances. The presence ofalcohol is relatively easier to detect from physical symptoms (e.g., breath)or behavior (e.g., inability to walk a straight line) than drug use (althoughalcohol symptoms often can be successfully masked), and people are morefamiliar with the symptoms of alcohol intoxication. Also, the time-framefor testing is limited, because the body processes alcohol within hoursof ingestion. If we decide to prohibit impairment, rather than use, thetime frame for testing would be further limited to the time the job performance.For that reason, certain types of testing may not be as useful for alcoholas they are in testing for drugs. Along with comments on the utility andneed for alcohol testing in general, we specifically invite comment onthe suitability for alcohol testing of the different types of drug tests(preemployment, periodic, reasonable cause, post-accident and random).Commenters also should address the utility of each type of test. In thisregard, we invite comments as to whether different types of tests are calledfor in different circumstances, such as blood testing only following anaccident. b. <T3>Preemployment Testing.</T3> Preemployment tests (for job applicantsor current employees transferring into covered positions) may or may notbe relevant, because testing normally would occur when the applicant isnot performing any sensitive safety function. However, they may providehelpful information for use by a medical officer in determining whetheran individual has a problem. Drinking prior to interviewing with a potential employer is not illegaleven though it might be imprudent. Therefore, there are legitimate questionsabout the significance of a positive test. On the other hand, it is possiblethat it could be used, along with other indicators, as a warning signalabout alcohol dependency. It might also be useful as one tool among manyfor an employer to determine whether an applicant can be expected to performreliably in a safety-related function. For example, the presence of alcoholmay indicate the need to ask follow-up questions of the applicants to determinewhether there would be a potential safety problem. Would such a test providesufficient benefits to warrant requiring it? Would it be necessary to limitthe use of any positive results; i.e., should we prohibit rejecting anapplicant solely on the basis of a positive test?c. <T3>Periodic Testing</T3>. As with preemployment testing, a primary purposeof periodic testing (at required, scheduled physicals) would be to identifypersons who may have an alcohol problem. Periodic testing often occursduring off-duty hours when the fact that the employee may be under theinfluence is not necessarily relevant to his or her job performance. Unlesswe determine to prohibit employees from having any alcohol content duringa physical examination, the primary purpose of such a test would be asa means of alerting employers to someone who may be a candidate for referralto an EAP or otherwise evaluated for substance dependency. Adding an alcoholtest to the regimen for a required physical might be beneficial becausethe examination might not otherwise identify the employee's problem. Ifa blood sample is already taken and could be used, it could lessen anylegal or cost obstacles. Would this type of test provide sufficient benefitsto warrant requiring it? As with preemployment testing, should we limitthe use of any positive results?d. <T3>Reasonable Cause Testing</T3>. Reasonable cause testing would be usefulto determine impairment during job performance. It would be based, as indrug testing, on a rule violation (e.g., FRA rule now provides for this)and/or on a reasonable suspicion by one or more supervisors that an employeeappeared to be under the influence. (The standard for triggering a testwould differ depending on whether the substantive prohibition of alcoholabuse went only to intoxication on the job or to any measurable BAC whilethe employee was working.)Because alcohol use often (at least at higher levels) results in more observablesymptoms (and because more research has been done on how to train peopleto make these observations), this test may be more valuable for alcoholthan for drugs. Although a supervisor may not know if the behavior is alcohol-related,whatever its cause it could support a decision to refuse to let the personoperate in a sensitive safety position. Supervisor observation would notbe a complete solution, however; ``practiced'' drinkers can appear normal(e.g., they can walk a straight line) and avoid detection. Also, supervisorsmay have reasons to overlook employee alcohol use (e.g., sympathy for employeeand dealing with problem is too much trouble). The Army has found thatsupervisors have a tendency to underreport alcohol involvement in accidents(The Alcohol and Accidents Guide, February 1987). Commenters also shouldaddress how to reduce the possibility of harassment. Would procedures similarto those for our drug testing rules (generally requiring two supervisors,etc.) be appropriate? Also, would this test be especially valuable in conjunctionwith reasonable cause testing for drugs? If an individual's behavior raisessuspicion and the person tests negative on an alcohol breathalyzer, someenforcement personnel might suggest performing a drug test.e. <T3>Post-Accident Testing. </T3>Post-accident testing is already requiredby federal regulation in some modes, and serves as a valuable accidentinvestigation and enforcement tool. States also conduct post-accident tests,depending upon the circumstances. Post-accident testing at remote locationsmight be more difficult to accomplish than drug testing, because alcoholpasses from the blood and breath more quickly than most drugs. Delays fortransportation of trained personnel to a test site could result in negativeor inconclusive tests. Requiring a blood test, for example, to be conductedwithin a very limited time could raise the costs tremendously by requiringexpensive forms of transportation in some instances. Therefore, it maybe necessary to use preliminary breath testing. This also may require theuse of trained people and special equipment. Commenters are invited toaddress this question, including the additional cost that may be involvedand any special problems that field breath testing would present in termsof the integrity of the test process.The drug rules require employers to test employees involved in an accidentas soon as possible, but not later than specified maximum time limits (generally32 hours). For the FRA, the average period of time is about 5 hours toget blood, but railroads run on track and accidents occur within limitedareas, unlike aviation or maritime accidents. Within what period of timeafter the accident should an employee be tested for alcohol? Should wearrange with state enforcement and/or investigative personnel to carryout such testing if the accident occurs in a remote area? They may be thefirst government officials able to get to the scene and are sometimes equippedto conduct field alcohol breath tests.f. <T3>Random Testing</T3>. Under the Department's drug rules, companies mustconduct random drug tests at a 50 percent annualized rate; that is, thenumber of annual random tests conducted should equal half the number ofthe testable population. Because alcohol is rapidly eliminated from thebody, random testing might be less effective for employees who, for example,do not work close to a place where a test can be conducted. The deterrenteffect of random testing might be reduced for the same reason. Commentersare requested to focus on how the objectives of random alcohol testing(e.g., deterrence) could be accomplished. Should we use a higher than 50percent annualized random testing rate? Because alcohol is generally eliminatedfrom the body within hours, can these tests be effectively administered?Is it too expensive and inefficient a means of identifying abusers? Doesit make sense if we only prohibit impairment on the job, rather than anyalcohol use? As discussed earlier, must any random testing be limited tothe specific times an employee is performing a sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunction? If so, how would this complicate implementation of a testingprogram? If alcohol misuse is more easily uncovered through observationand reasonable cause testing, will random testing add enough more deterrenteffect to an overall program to meet constitutional muster?g. <T3>Pre-Performance Tests_</T3>(1) General. Pre-performance testing couldpotentially be used in lieu of other forms of alcohol testing. Dependingupon the industry, supervised testing could be conducted before a coveredperson assumed his or her duties on board a plane or ship, or unsupervisedself-testing-type systems could be used to prevent a vehicle from operatingif a person failed a test.The advantage of pre-performance testing is that it detects an employee'simpairment at the time he or she begins to perform sensitive safety- orsecurity-related functions in a job where it is illegal to be under theinfluence of alcohol. Of all the kinds of testing, pre-performance testsmay offer the most direct nexus to improving safety. They also could providea strong deterrent. However, pre-performance testing may not be feasiblefor certain industries. Furthermore, technological and cost issues havenot been resolved for some types of tests.(2) <T3>Pre-Performance Testing: Under Supervision.</T3> An individual couldbe given a BAC test prior to performing a sensitive safety- or security-relatedfunction. This type of test is now being done in Alaska by Alyeska PipelineService Company. All crewmembers are tested prior to being allowed to work.Crewmembers that fail the test are not permitted to work until a test ispassed.This same system, or a variation, could be employed in other industrieswhere an individual reports to a specific station before operating a commercialvehicle. For example, in some segments of the trucking industry, driversreport to a central dispatch facility every day and return at the end ofthe day. Most commercial pilots also report to a central location priorto flying. In such instances, supervised BAC testing may be feasible. Inother segments of the two industries noted above, supervised BAC testingcould be impractical and unmanageable. However, the system eventually decidedupon by the Department to check for alcohol would not need to be uniformin every respect and in every segment of each of the regulated industries,if circumstances warrant different approaches. This may make the rulesmore complex, but could provide necessary flexibility to companies. Inaddition, it might be appropriate to give companies the option of conductingeither a pre-performance test or a random test.Commenters should address how such a system could be developed for eachindustry, and the costs of such a system. We are also interested in theexperience gained by the use of such tests in the U.S., as well as in othercountries. What are the benefits of a pre-performance test? How would suchbenefits compare with a random test? How should a pre-performance positivetest be treated? Any rule implemented would prohibit an individual fromoperating a commercial vehicle (aircraft, vessel, etc.) if a test werefailed. However, commenters should address the need for regulations thatmandate what additional action should be taken upon a positive test? Aresanctions needed, or should such steps be addressed by individual companies?Would alternative alcohol testing requirements (e.g., pre-performance vs.random) provide flexibility to companies? Is flexibility needed? To beeffective, must pre-performance tests be conducted before all operations,or could they be done on a random basis? How often? Should tests be performedat a central meeting place prior to an employee's assumption of dutiesor should the test be attached to the vehicle's ignition system (discussedbelow)? Could an employee simply start drinking after passing the pre-performancetest?(3) <T3>Pre-Performance Testing: Unsupervised.</T3> The Department, throughNHTSA, began to investigate the use of in-vehicle alcohol test devices(ignition interlock devices, referred to as ``IID's'') in 1968. The typesof devices developed over the years have focused on breath and performancetype tests; generally, if a driver does not pass the test, the vehiclewill not operate or, under some systems, if operated, the emergency flashersor horn will automatically go off.A recent report submitted to Congress describes the effectiveness and potentialfor application of ignition interlock devices to prohibit operation ofmotor vehicles by intoxicated drivers. (``Potential for Application ofIgnition Interlock Device to Prohibit Operation of Motor Vehicles by IntoxicatedIndividuals: A Report to Congress''.) NHTSA also performed laboratory testingfor commercially available in-vehicle test devices. (``Further LaboratoryTesting of In-Vehicle Alcohol Test Devices.'')Initially, attempts to develop IID's based on breath alcohol tests werehampered by technological limitations and concerns that they were too susceptibleto circumvention or cheating. At this point, however, the NHTSA reportnotes that these problems have been partially or completely solved. Thenew devices are more reliable and accurate, and are designed to preventor detect many forms of tampering and circumvention. NHTSA tests have indicatedthat the devices are more difficult to circumvent, but relatively uncomplicatedstrategies can still be used to ``fool'' these devices (e.g., use of bogusair samples or filters). In spite of these evasive practices, improvementsare possible that would further address potential circumvention. NHTSAalso noted that IID's are now being used by a specific population group(those subject to court supervision because they are convicted of drivingunder the influence) in passenger vehicles. Their placement in generaluse would likely meet public resistance due to costs. It should also benoted that the experience gained thus far has been in passenger motor vehiclesonly. What would the costs be to install comparable devices in commercialvehicles? What about vehicles used in other modes of transportation?(a) <T3>Performance Tests.</T3> Early research on IID's had focused on performancetests as well as breath tests. However, research and development work haveindicated that while performance tests may be operationally feasible, auseful device does not yet exist.The Canadian transportation ministry funded research that compared oneperformance test, the Critical Tracking Tester (CTT), with another, theTracometer. The CTT requires a driver to keep a pointer centered on a dialby appropriate movements of the steering wheel. The device generates randommovements of the pointer at an increasing rate, requiring the driver tomake corrective movements at an increasing speed. The Tracometer requiresa driver to align a pointer with one of five targets that are randomlyilluminated, requiring the driver to turn the wheel in the opposite directionof the desired pointer direction. The research concluded that the Tracometerprovided better discrimination than did the CTT in detecting BAC limits(0.08 in Canada). However, the researchers concluded that while the Tracometerappeared to be promising, further work was necessary before a practicaldevice would be available.The NHTSA report concludes that a useful device does not yet exist andthus more work is needed. For example, the CTT's are least accurate atmoderate BAC levels (0.05-0.10). The report also notes that there is apparentlylittle development work currently being done on performance-based systems.(b) <T3>Breath Tests Using Ignition Interlock Devices. </T3>With respect tobreath alcohol testing, there are currently three IID's available on themarket. Basically the devices are a simple form of a portable breath tester,but are not as sophisticated as evidential quality breath tests used bythe police. The three IID's are fairly similar. Each has three components:an alcohol breath test unit, an electronic control device, and a connectorto the vehicle's ignition and electrical system. The alcohol sensor isa breath test unit that is a hand-held unit and requires the driver toblow into the device. Only if the driver passes the test can the car bestarted. The devices use different sensors (pressure and/or temperature)to reduce the likelihood of circumvention.The IID's currently are marketed primarily to traffic courts for use withdrivers convicted of DWI/DUI. Such drivers may be required by the courtto install a device on their car. (Manufacturers envision further use ofthe devices, such as by fleet owners or commercial vehicles.) Nine stateshave passed legislation authorizing the use of IID's with convicted DUIoffenders. In California, for example, a two-year program was initiatedand terminates at the end of 1989, when an evaluation will be made. (California'sinterlocks prevent persons with a BAC of 0.03 or above from starting thevehicle.) Other states are also considering legislation.Based on the information available to date, the NHTSA report reached aseries of general conclusions about the new breath test ignition interlockdevices. These conclusions are listed in Appendix C.Commenters should address the feasibility of implementing such a programof IID's for a particular company or industries, and specify the potentialproblems if such an approach were adopted. Would these devices have anyapplication to types of vehicles other than motor vehicles? Will employeesaccept such devices? What are the practical problems of such devices? Willsuch a system be effective in cutting down the use of alcohol in the transportationindustry? If used in the context of preperformance testing, what staffingproblems would this cause? How will it affect accident rates? What arethe costs? What are the ways of getting around the system? Even if thesystems are not 100 percent tamper-proof, will the fact that such machinesare in place make employees more aware of the need to stay sober? Are thedevices cost-effective if this is the case? Finally, IID's are accuratein detecting low BAC levels. Would the usefulness of the tests be affectedif we prohibited any positive BAC level?NHTSA estimated that the one-year lease costs for one IID could be as highas $400-$500. Would IID's be cost effective? How would IID costs compareto random testing costs, for example?We welcome public comment on any additional new technological devices thatare accurate and reliable.h. <T3>Post-Rehabilitation Testing.</T3> Another approach would be to improvethe follow-up of alcohol abusers who receive treatment and re-enter thework force. Alcohol testing could be useful as part of post-rehabilitationmonitoring. Once an employee has undergone rehabilitation, there is a needto ensure continued disassociation from alcohol. However, many substanceabusers do not restrict themselves to one type of drug; they often combinedrugs, including alcohol. Alcohol testing could become a useful part ofthe follow-up testing of rehabilitated substance abusers.Is there any data that shows alcohol use rises when drug use declines,or vice-versa? Should we require post-rehabilitation monitoring and a recommendationfor reinstatement from the MRO or EAP counselor before an employee canbe returned to the job? If not, who should make the decision on what kindof rehabilitation the employee needs? Who should make the determinationthat the employee has established control over the substance abuse problemand has a good prognosis for recovery? Should there be procedures by whichthe employee can contest a determination that he or she is not ready toreturn to work?Should there be a uniform testing period after rehabilitation, or shouldthis be determined on a case-by-case basis? If we adopt a uniform post-rehabilitationperiod, how long should it be? Should the length of the follow-up perioddepend on the BAC level that was detected? Should it depend on the severityof the individual's alcohol problem, as indicated by the kind of treatmentthat was found to be necessary? (For example, should someone undergoinginpatient rehabilitation be subject to post-rehabilitation testing fora longer time than someone who needs only abatement counseling?) Who shoulddecide? Recognizing that alcoholism may be a lifetime disease, is therea period of time after the initial phase of rehabilitation when a relapseis most likely and during which testing would be valuable? If so, how longis that period? What should happen to a person who tests positive aftercompleting rehabilitation? During the post-rehabilitation period, shouldwe prescribe the minimum and/or maximum number of tests to be administered?We would want to ensure that any necessary tests would be given frequentlyenough to ensure that the employee is not abusing alcohol. At the sametime, however, we do not want alcohol testing to become an instrument ofharassment.One alternative, on which we also invite comments, is a specified post-rehabilitationtesting period that would apply only if the employee, the MRO, the EAPcounselor, and perhaps the employer failed to agree on an individualizedprogram. Such a fall-back system could provide, for example, for up tofour additional tests during the 12 months following rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Means of Alcohol Testing</ITAG>A. IntroductionThis section contains a discussion of the principal methods for conductingtests for the consumption of alcohol, including a list of some of the advantagesand disadvantages of each methodology. Comments are requested concerningthe cost and practicality of the various methodologies. Commenters shouldgive references to specific studies in support of their comments.B. Breath TestingThere are two types of breath testing devices: (1) The preliminary breathtesting (PBT) device, discussed above in the preperformance section, ahand-held device that is useful as a screening tool; and (2) the evidentiarybreath testing device (EBT), generally a larger machine found in policestations, that can provide results allowed as evidence in legal proceedings.The FRA allows the use of PBTs exclusively as a screening technique andrequires evidentiary testing to follow.In the breath alcohol test, often used by police agencies to test suspecteddrunk drivers, the subject blows into a machine that makes a chemical analysisof the expelled breath. The machine provides a reading expressed in termsof blood alcohol concentration. Breath tests, although they may be consideredsomewhat invasive, may nevertheless be less invasive and thus more acceptableto some people than other forms of tests. They provide a reasonably accuratemeasure of BAC, at least if they meet NHTSA specifications for accuracyand are properly calibrated. Many states accept the results of evidentiarybreath testing devices as <T3>per se</T3> determinants of intoxication.Perhaps most significant in the context of workplace testing, breath testing,unlike blood and urine tests, provides an immediate response, so that follow-upaction can be instituted promptly. In addition, it does not require elaboratechain of custody procedures for collection or laboratory analysis, sinceno specimens have to be sent to a laboratory for analysis.On the other hand, breath testing requires specific training and a qualitycontrol program to ensure proper administration of the test and calibrationof the device. Calibration requires proper use of a breath alcohol simulator,which in turn may require that the unit be set up by a chemist followinga specified procedure. The initial costs of EBT's (between about $400 and$5,000), as well as the costs of calibration, are substantial.Comments are requested on procedural standards for conducting a breathtest. We note that no nationally accepted standards exist, although theFRA, for example, has developed guidance materials for its programs. Eachstate, however, has its own standards for police administration of breathtests, and these standards vary considerably.One potential problem with breath testing is that no sample remains afterthe test for retesting in the event of a challenge. This is of particularconcern if the test is administered by the employer, because some employeesmay question the neutrality of the test; in such cases blood tests mightbe necessary in order to confirm a ``positive'' breath test result. Whatqualifications should people have to administer a breath alcohol test?Is there any need to confirm a breath alcohol test? We request commenton whether any have used this approach and had problems.C. Blood TestingIn this approach, a blood sample is taken from the individual, by normalmedical procedures for taking blood samples. The sample is sent to a laboratorywhere it is analyzed for blood alcohol concentration. Measurement is thusmade of the actual blood alcohol concentration and the test does not relyon breath/blood partition or on interpolation from the urine concentration.Blood testing is accepted in all jurisdictions as evidence concerning whetherthe tested individual is or is not intoxicated. While the test must beconducted in a laboratory, the medical technology required is not especiallygreat; there are many laboratories that can perform these tests competently,although there is no certification program comparable to that offered bythe Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing. (DOT's TransportationSystems Center does conduct a voluntary program of laboratory proficiencytesting. Laboratories that sign up for the program are given blood sampleswith known quantities of alcohol; if the lab provides an inaccurate testresult, it is notified so that it can correct its procedures or equipment.)Nevertheless, blood testing is the most physically invasive of all formsof alcohol testing, and some people may be afraid of having blood drawn.In addition, taking a blood sample, while relatively simple, is still amedical procedure, and should be performed only by a qualified professionalor technician and only at a suitable physical location. It may not be feasibleto conduct field sampling of employees' blood. We seek comment on how thosewho have used this procedure have handled employee fear and other implementationproblems.Blood tests have the same problems as any other test that must be sentto a laboratory (including the drug tests required by the Department).That is, the results of the test are not immediately available, so therewould inevitably be a delay before employers would be able to identifythe need for further action. And it would be necessary to establish collection,chain of custody and laboratory procedures analogous to those for urinetesting. We ask for comment on whether any acceptable procedures exists.D. Urine TestingIn this approach, employees would give a urine sample, just as in the caseof drug testing. The simplest method of administering a urine test wouldinvolve collecting a single sample. This would provide evidence with respectto prior alcohol use, but would not give a reliable indication of the currentBAC level. A more elaborate two-step process can indicate current alcohollevels. In the first step, the test subject voids. The collector then waitsuntil the subject can give a second sample, typically at least one-halfhour. The second sample, since it includes only newly excreted fluids,can be interpolated to calculate the approximate blood alcohol concentration.The success of this method requires that the initial void be complete.The double void will take more employee time than the single void neededfor urine drug testing, thus increasing costs.Compared to blood testing, urinalysis is less invasive physically, althoughit may be considered more of a privacy invasion. Of all the types of tests,it has the advantage of requiring the least skill to perform the on-sitesteps. In addition, since urine samples are already being taken for drugs,a requirement to institute alcohol tests might require no additional personnelor on-site equipment. This could be a significant cost advantage.The disadvantages of urinalysis parallel those of drug testing. The delaynecessary between the time of collection and the time results are availablemeans a corresponding delay before corrective action or rehabilitationcan be begun, where necessary.In addition, there is no uniform cut-off parallel to BAC and, except forthe Transportation Systems Center's limited and voluntary laboratory proficiencyprogram, there is no nationally-recognized system of regulation for laboratoriesperforming alcohol tests. There is no question that a urine test, particularlya two-step test, can determine whether an individual has recently consumedmeasurable amounts of alcohol. Thus, if the Department were to establisha permissible alcohol level of ``zero,'' there is little doubt that urinalysiscould be a useful tool. Some might argue, however, that the correlationbetween alcohol concentration in urine and its concentration in blood isinsufficiently precise to be used as a measurement for higher cutoffs,such as .04 or .10. However, we note that FRA authorizes the use of urinalysisfor alcohol (with a conservative assumption that the urine concentrationis 1.5 times the blood alcohol level), and some recent literature has alsoendorsed it. The use of conservative conversion factors may result in underestimationof the BAC.E. Other TechniquesThere are less-expensive means of determining approximate blood alcoholconcentration. We specifically request public comment on the feasibilityof using the following devices or other similar ones separately or in conjunctionwith other methods of testing.There are strips that turn various colors when wet with saliva mixed withan enzyme. The colors indicate saliva-alcohol concentration, which statisticallyis a close approximation of blood alcohol concentration. According to aNHTSA study, this method appears to give highly variable results with ahigh incidence of false positives. However, it could be used by individualsto determine if they can safely drive.A different device consists of a tube filled with chemical crystals. Afterbreaking an internal ampul containing the crystals, the person being testedexpels breath into the tube. The crystals change color to indicate theamount of alcohol in the subject's breath. The device does not accuratelymeasure blood alcohol concentration, but it is useful to indicate the presenceof alcohol in the individual's system, and has been marketed for use byprivate individuals who want to determine whether it is safe for them todrive.One device now in use by some police agencies is the Passive Alcohol Sensor(PAS), an electronic device which tests ambient air in front of a driver'smouth for the presence of alcohol. It must be placed within six inchesof the subject's mouth. The device gives false positives about 10 percentof the time, and temperature and wind conditions affect its accuracy. Themore sophisticated PBT's are more accurate, but are also subject to environmentalvariations from cold, wind, subject's cooperativeness, etc.These and similar devices could not be used as tests upon which legallyeffective determinations of intoxication could be made. However, it couldbe possible, if a blood or urine test were the method of choice, to usesuch devices as a means of screening employees. That is, if an employeeshowed no evidence of alcohol on one of these screening tests, a more costlyand invasive blood or urine test might not be necessary. To use these devicesfor this screening purpose, it would be necessary to determine, as well,whether they tend to give false negative readings. We would appreciatepublic comment on this. We note that the concerns that the Department hadwith respect to the use of screen test results to make permanent employmentdecisions also apply to alcohol testing.One other promising method for identifying people who may be under theinfluence of alcohol may be behavioral sobriety tests. NHTSA has developeda Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST), which comprises three psychophysicaltests. The three tests are: Walk and Turn (walking a straight line andback again); One-Leg Stand (one stage of which requires the subject tostand on one leg and count from ``one thousand and one'' to ``one thousandand thirty''); and Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. The first two tests measurea person's balance, muscular coordination and ability to concentrate ontwo activities. The horizontal nystagmus technique, which is used by somepolice departments as part of a roadside screening, relies on identifyingthe tendency of the eyes to jerk involuntarily as they move back and forth.This tendency becomes more pronounced with increased consumption of alcohol;depending upon the individual, usually the first clues of impairment occurat BAC levels of .05-.08. It is difficult to fake normal nystagmus andthe horizontal gaze nystagmus test is reported to be the most accuratemethod of detecting alcohol use without breath analysis or other specializedequipment. However, significant training and practice is required to masterand retain this ``testing'' skill. We specifically invite commenters toaddress the utility of increased training in this and/or other methodsof identifying persons who have consumed alcohol.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Other Practical Problems</ITAG>If alcohol testing is proposed, there are a myriad of implementation questionsthat will need to be addressed. In many cases, they are the same as, oranalogous to, questions that were addressed and resolved in the drug testingrules or the ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs''(49 CFR part 40). However, there may also be differences, and we invitecommenters to address any practical problems they foresee, including recommendedsolutions.One problem has been alluded to already: while we have limited the performanceof drug tests to laboratories certified by the Department of Health andHuman Services, there is no fully-comparable program to certify laboratoriesperforming alcohol tests. Of course, some tests (i.e., breath) do not requirelaboratory analysis, so this may not be a problem. In addition, it maybe that alcohol testing is sufficiently simple that no special certificationis necesssary. On the other hand, if we were to require testing, we wouldwant to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the accuracy oftest results. A related question involving laboratories is capacity. Amandatory alcohol testing program would undoubtedly increase demand forlaboratory services greatly. Is there sufficient capacity in the industryto accommodate such a demand?The role of a Medical Review Officer (MRO) would be another area of controversy.Should an MRO have to certify results before they are reported, as is donefor drug testing? One important function of the MRO in connection withdrug testing is to ascertain whether there is a legitimate explanationfor the presence of drugs in the employee's system (e.g., ingestion ofcough syrup). Does this consideration have relevance for alcohol? A legalexplanation for the presence of drugs results in a negative finding. However,if an individual exceeds an established BAC level should it matter thatit resulted from legal medication; i.e., if the person is under the influenceof alcohol while performing a safety function, is it necessary to knowmore? Does the question turn on the level of alcohol prohibited? Even ifan MRO would not be necessary to consider the circumstances of alcoholingestion, would it not still be necessary to have an independent reviewof the chain of custody?What are the costs associated with different types of testing? What kindsof calibration or other standards do we need for different types of tests?<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Process Matters</ITAG>It is not clear at this preliminary point what the annual effect of anyrule or program will be on the economy. To the extent the Department isaware of costs or benefits, it has provided that data in this document.However, there are too many variables and possible permutations of alternativesfor the Department to provide an overall cost benefit analysis. Upon reviewof the comments, the Department will assess the costs and benefits if furtherregulatory action is deemed appropriate. We do not anticipate at this pointthat the annual effect on the economy will be $100 million or more forany particular mode. If it becomes apparent at a later stage in this rulemakingthat the impact on the economy will be major, then we will prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis. Otherwise we will prepare an economic evaluation in accordancewith the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. Commenters shouldsubmit any relevant cost data.This ANPRM is significant under the Department's Regulatory Policies andProcedures, because it involves matters of significant public and Congressionalinterest.For the reasons noted above, at this time, we do not know whether therewould be a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will be prepared if we determinethat this rulemaking would have such an impact. At this stage, we cannotdetermine whether this rule will impose any reporting or paperwork requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act.FederalismDepending upon what action we determine to take, this rulemaking may havesubstantial effects on the states or on the relationship between the nationalgovernment and the states. One option under consideration is to rely onincreased state enforcement to combat the alcohol problem. Because of themany possibilities and permutations, at this time, we do not have enoughinformation to determine whether a Federalism Assessment will be necessaryin accordance with Executive Order 12612. We specifically request thatcommenters consider the impact on federalism of any of their comments orproposals.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>Alcohol abuse, Safety, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 49 U.S.C. 322.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, October 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel K.

Appendix B_Existing DOT Regulations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">A. Alcohol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a general matter, the Department's alcohol efforts have focusedon alcohol as it affects an individual's medical qualifications; prohibitionson on-duty use and, in certain cases, use just prior to reporting to work;and sanctions for violations of the Federal regulatory scheme. With limitedexceptions, alcohol testing is left to State enforcement personnel. (CoastGuard and FRA rules provide for post-accident and reasonable cause testing.FAA requires crewmembers to submit to tests upon request.) The Departmenthas nine operating administrations. A brief description of their generalfunctions and their specific responses to the problem of alcohol use orabuse follow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2. Current Modal Administration Regulations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>U.S. Coast Guard.</T3> The Coast Guard carries out a number of functionsincluding commercial vessel and recreational boating safety, search andrescue missions, enforcement of maritime law, bridge administration, portand environmental safety, regulation of deepwater ports, marine environmentalresponses, icebreaking operations, and aids to navigation. In addition,in conjunction with other agencies, the Coast Guard carries out drug interdictionactions aimed at stopping the importation of drugs into the U.S. throughits coastal waters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Coast Guard has broad authority for commercial vessel safety.The Coast Guard issues licenses and merchant mariner documents to merchantseamen. It also investigates marine casualties and can and does proceedagainst licenses or documents for violation of dangerous drug laws or fornegligent acts while under the influence of alcohol. The Coast Guard alsohas been taking action against licenses and merchant mariner's documentsof seamen who have been found to be either in the possession of intoxicatingliquor or intoxicated by alcohol.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1984 established civil and criminalpenalties for operating a vessel while intoxicated, as determined understandards developed by the Coast Guard. In addition to establishing penaltiesfor operating a vessel while intoxicated, the Act requires future reportsof marine casualties to include information concerning whether the useof alcohol contributed to the casualty. The Coast Guard issued a finalrule, effective January 13, 1988, implementing the directive in the 1984Authorization Act. It established Federal behavioral and blood alcoholconcentration (BAC) intoxication standards for both commercial and recreationalvessel operators. Either the behavioral or BAC standard can independentlybe used to determine intoxication. The behavioral standard is useful, becauseblood tests may be refused or not taken in a timely manner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule applies a .04 percent BAC standard to operators of all commercialvessels, including fishing vessels. For recreational boaters, the FederalBAC standard is .10 percent. This and the Federal behavioral standard applyonly in the absence of existing State BAC and behavioral standards or outsideof State territorial waters. For example, if a State has only a behavioralstandard, the Federal .10 percent BAC level would also apply to recreationalboaters. The rule does not preempt enforcement by a State of its applicablelaws and regulations concerning operating a recreational vessel while intoxicatedor limit more stringent employer-sponsored programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule requires employers to ensure that intoxicated individualsare not permitted on duty. Crewmembers are prohibited from operating avessel while intoxicated, drinking on duty or assuming duties within fourhours of consuming alcohol. The rule covers U.S. vessels operating anywhere,foreign vessels operated in U.S. waters and individuals with an essentialrole in operating a vessel, but not when they are on shore. It providesfor licensed personnel to seek voluntary rehabilitation prior to beingsubject to a suspension or revocation proceeding for intoxicant-relatedincompetence; allows Coast Guard officers to terminate the use of certainvessels when the operator appears to be under the influence of an intoxicantso that further operation creates an unsafe condition; and requires employers'reports on marine casualties to include specific information on the roleof intoxicants in the accident.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule allows post-accident and reasonable cause testing for intoxicantsby employers and State law enforcement officials. Where practicable, themarine employer's determination of reasonable cause should be based onobservation of the individual's behavior and demeanor by two persons. Refusalby commercial mariners to submit to a test is presumptive of intoxication(if State law permits such a presumption; this is true for recreationalboaters as well). Individuals determined to be intoxicated will have theopportunity during judicial or administrative hearings to dispute the charge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the Coast Guard has instructed its casualty investigatorsto be closely attuned to the possibility of drug or alcohol involvementin marine casualties and is training investigators to look for and recognizealcohol or drug ties to accidents. The Coast Guard, in cooperation withthe National Association of State Boating Law Administrators, and the NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB), has developed and distributed to thestates a set of guidelines for states to use in developing state legislationaddressing the drug and alcohol problem. Among other concerns, the guidelinesaddress restrictions and prohibitions that should be considered, testing,evidentiary requirements, penalties, and education.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Independent of present regulations, the master of a vessel traditionallyhas had plenary disciplinary authority aboard his vessel. Even today, amaster may, and often does, deal with alcohol-related problems by loggingindividuals who are intoxicated and docking their pay.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon completion of the voyage, a Coast Guard marine investigator reviewsthe ship's log. In addition to the shipboard punishment imposed by themaster, the investigator normally will charge a mariner with misconductfor failure to perform due to intoxication, subjecting the mariner to asuspension and revocation proceeding before an Administrative Law Judge.Depending on the circumstances of the incident, the mariner may be givena letter of admonishment, a suspension under probation, or outright suspensionor revocation of his license and/or document. The Administrative Law Judgealso may direct the mariner to enter a rehabilitation program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Coast Guard also has internal procedures that address alcoholproblems and drug use by its military employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Federal Aviation Administration.</T3> The Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) is charged with regulating air commerce. This includes programs governingsafety, airspace and air traffic management, air navigation facilities,research, engineering, development, testing and evaluation of systems neededfor a safe and efficient system, airport development and aircraft registration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FAA alcohol regulations cover pilots, flight engineers, and othercrewmembers. For example, they prohibit any pilot from acting or attemptingto act as a crewmember if he or she is under the influence of alcohol,or has consumed any alcoholic beverage within 8 hours of reporting forduty. FAA regulations also prohibit a pilot from flying with a blood alcoholconcentration (BAC) of .04 or higher. The FAA can suspend or revoke a certificateor assess penalties for failure to comply with its regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FAA requires pilots to have medical examinations (private andrecreational pilots_once every 2 years; commercial pilots_once every year;airline transport pilots_once every 6 months). If a history of drug dependence,alcoholism, or mental problems is discovered, the FAA may disqualify thepilot. The FAA also uses a ``driving while intoxicated'' (DWI) or a ``drivingunder the influence'' (DUI) conviction as an indication of a possible alcoholor drug problem. The FAA recently issued a notice of proposed rulemakingdesigned to identify those pilots that are convicted of driving while intoxicatedor driving under the influence and review their medical qualificationsin light of such convictions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, the FAA requires crewmembers to submit to an alcohol teston request of a law enforcement officer who has a reasonable basis to believethat the crewmember may have violated state alcohol rules. The law enforcementofficer must be authorized under State or local law to obtain such tests.State law and practices vary; only six states give explicit authority toobtain such tests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is also important to note the role of international conventionsin this area. Annex 2 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation(the Chicago Convention), section 2.5, of which the United States is acontracting state, provides that no person shall pilot or act as a flightcrewmember while impaired by an intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Federal Highway Administration.</T3> The Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) is involved in a variety of areas such as financial assistance,highway construction and motor carrier safety. It has the authority toestablish medical/physical qualification requirements for truck and busdrivers and has had regulations on this subject for over 30 years. Withinthe context of a comprehensive, nationwide revamping of testing, licensingand disqualification procedures for commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operators,the FHWA recently established stringent regulations defining driving underthe influence of alcohol (DUI) for commercial drivers. However, enforcementof the DUI standard continues to be primarily the responsibility of theStates in the motor carrier field.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FHWA regulations require that commercial drivers submit to a medicalexamination once every two years. A driver will not be considered physicallyqualified to drive a motor vehicle if, among other things, the driver iscurrently a practicing alcoholic.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FHWA regulations prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages within fourhours of reporting to work, and prohibit a driver from working while havingany measured BAC or any detected presence of alcohol in his or her system.These and related infractions carry a 24-hour out-of-service penalty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CDL regulations and the FMCSRs also require that a driver be disqualifiedfor one year if the driver is convicted of a DUI offense at the .04 percentBAC level or greater, or for a drug offense. The offenses must have occurredwhile the driver was driving a CMV or a vehicle subject to the FMCSRs.Second offenses, or offenses involving the movement of hazardous materials,carry longer disqualification penalties, ranging from three years to life.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commercial Driver's License Information System (CDLIS), implementedunder the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, will constitutea useful tool for identifying and removing from the road problem drinkerswho drive CMVs. After March 31, 1992, every driver of a CMV nationwidewill be required to hold a CDL from his or her state of domicile, issuedaccording to FHWA standards. Since the CDLIS will be the nationwide clearinghousefor driving record information for all CDL holders, and since states mustcheck with the CDLIS to yield important highway safety benefits in thealcohol area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On October 4, 1988, FHWA issued regulations whereby a commercial motorvehicle (CMV) driver found to have a blood alcohol concentration levelof .04 or above will be deemed to be DUI. States are required to adoptthis standard for CMV operators, or face the loss of highway funding. Theyalso require commercial motor vehicle operators with any measured BAC tobe placed out-of-service for a 24 hour period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The new DUI standard has not as yet been applied by the States. Underthe statutory mandate that authorized the Department to set the DUI standard,Congress recognized that it would take some time for the States to implementthe program. Therefore, States have until September 30, 1993 to adopt thesestandards. The States are rapidly enacting legislation to implement theentire CDL program, including its BAC provisions; over half the Stateshad enacted the .04 percent BAC level for CMV drivers by late summer 1989.The FHWA program thus establishes a DUI standard for a CMV driver, andsets penalties, which are to be enforced by the States. Currently, alcoholtesting is done by the States, but the new provisions mandate a lower anduniform BAC, as well as penalties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Federal Railroad Administration.</T3> The Federal Railroad Administration(FRA) is involved in areas such as railroad safety, financial assistance,and national rail transportation policy. Since 1970, FRA has had statutoryauthority to regulate all fields of railroad safety, including employeequalifications as they relate to safety. Historically, FRA encouraged railmanagement and labor to work together on alcohol and drug prevention programs,especially employee assistance programs. However, such programs were notrequired.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1985, FRA issued a final rule governing the conduct of railroadsand employees subject to the Hours of Service Act (engine, train and yardcrews, dispatchers and train order operators, and signal employees). Thefinal rule prohibits on-the-job use, possession of or impairment by alcoholor any controlled substance as well as having a BAC level of .04 or more.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule mandates full toxicological testing (blood and urine) aftercertain accidents that involve significant public interest or a high likelihoodof human failure (approximately 200 events per year). Railroads also areauthorized to conduct breath and urine tests: (1) On reasonable suspicionof impairment; (2) after a human factor accident/incident; and (3) afterother specified operating/safety rule violations. Effective March 1, 1986,railroads were required to institute pre-employment drug screening forpotential employees, which may include alcohol analysis. The rule furtherrequires railroads to have ``voluntary referral'' policies, thereby allowingworkers to enroll in assistance programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Maritime Administration.</T3> The Maritime Administration (MARAD) administersprograms to aid the development, promotion, and operation of the U.S. merchantmarine. MARAD also administers of U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, which hasan enrollment of approximately 1,100 people. The Academy regulations strictlyforbid the use and possession of controlled substances and the use andpossession of alcohol on Academy grounds. (Consumption of alcohol for specialevents can be authorized.) Entering freshman at the Academy must submitto urinalysis as part of the admissions process. For good cause, a midshipmancan be sent to the infirmary for urine or blood tests for drug or alcoholuse. Confirmation of a drug or alcohol rule violation leads to automaticexplusion. A full administrative hearing procedure is available. Thereis also an active counseling program on campus. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. <T3>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</T3> The National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) carries out programs relating tothe safety performance of motor vehicles and related equipment, motor vehicledrivers and pedestrains, a national maximum speed limit, and a nationalminimum drinking age, among other things. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NHTSA is actively involved in developing programs to reduce alcoholand other drug use by all motorists, including operators of commercialvehicles. NHTSA's programs include providing technical and financial assistanceto the states. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the section 402 program, NHTSA provides for a variety of Statehighway safety programs. In a joint final rule, published in April 1988,NHTSA and FHWA identified national priority program areas; included amongthem are alcohol and other drug counter-measures such as enforcement, educationand public information and improvement of records and court systems. NHTSAprovides technical assistance to states for DUI enforcement, such as thedevelopment and promotion of the use of its Standardized Field SobrietyTest (SFST), SFST training and SFST instructor training. The SFST consistsof three psycophysical tests that are used to detect drug and alcohol impairment.The three tests are: Walk and Turn (walking a straight line and back again);One-Leg Stand (one stage of which requires the subject to stand on oneleg and count from ``one thosand and one'' to ``one thousand and thirty'');and Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus. The first two tests measure a person's balance,muscular coordination and ability to concentrate on two activities. Thehorizontal nystagmus technique, which is used by some police departmentsas part of a roadside screening, relies on identifying the tendency ofthe eyes to jerk involuntarily as they move back and forth. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The section 408 alcohol incentive grant program provides funds toStates that have improved laws and programs to reduce traffic safety problemsinvolving drivers under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.The program is available to all qualifying States_21 have currently qualified.Through the 408 program, NHTSA also awards grants to States that have programsthat satisfy certain supplemental criteria established by regulation, orthat enact tough sentencing laws for individuals convicted of driving underthe influence of alcohol. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, a joint NHTSA/FHWA regulation implements the Federal statutethat requires that certain Federal highway funds be withheld from Statesthat permit the purchase or public possession of alcohol by those underthe age of 21. The law provides for a five percent total withholding inFY87 and a ten percent withholding in all succeeding fiscal years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g. <T3>Research and Special Programs Administration.</T3> The Research andSpecial Programs Administration (RSPA) regulates the safety of transportationof hazardous materials and the transportation of natural gas and hazardousliquids by pipeline, collects air carrier economic data, and conducts multimodaltransportation research and development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">RSPA has no specific regulations on alcohol. It does have a generalregulation on health of pipeline workers at liquified natural gas plants.Pipeline operators must look for any physical condition that would impairperformance, including any observable disorder or condition that is discoverableby a professional examination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h. <T3>St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. </T3>The St. LawrenceSeaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) is responsible for the development,operation and maintenance of that portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway thatfalls within the territorial limits of the U.S.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No specific legislation or SLSDC regulation covers alcohol and otherdrug use, but a general regulation allows the Corporation to prohibit thetransit of a vessel if the crew is incompetent or inadequate and to boardthe vessel to determine this. The U.S. Coast Guard regulations apply toU.S. pilots, crewmen and vessels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. <T3>Urban Mass Transportation Administration.</T3> The Urban Mass TransportationAdministration (UMTA) assists in developing improved mass transportationfacilities, planning and financing of such systems, and encouraging privatesector involvement in local mass transit systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The UMTA grant statutes prohibit the agency from making grants unlessrecipients have the legal, technical, and financial capability to carryout UMTA-assisted projects, including the ability to provide safe transitservices. Grantees must exercise satisfactory continuing control over UMTA-assistedfacilities and equipment. UMTA has no current regulations concerning alcohol.Even so, many of UMTA's grantees are subject to other Federal requirementson alcohol use. All commuter rail lines funded by UMTA, for example, aresubject to FRA regulations. All drivers of UMTA-funded vehicles that arecapable of carrying more than 15 passengers, including the driver, aresubject to the FHWA DUI standards. However, other grantees, small transitsystems, for example, and all UMTA-funded rail systems other than commuterrail, are not subject to Federal requirements on alcohol use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B. Drugs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On November 21, 1988, six modal administrations of the Departmentof Transportation published final rules that require the commercial transportationoperators they regulate to test employees in sensitive safety- and security-relatedoccupations for drugs and to develop employee assistance programs (EAP)to provide information and training. The rules cover approximately 4 millionpersons in the aviation, highway, railroad, pipeline, mass transit andmaritime industries. The employers are required to conduct preemployment,periodic (physicals), post-accident, reasonable cause, random, and returnto duty drug tests and to test for five classes of drugs: marijuana, cocaine,amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP) and opiates. The testing must be conductedin accordance with DOT-wise regulations based on the Department of Healthand Human Services Guidelines (HHS), which are designed to protect theprivacy and dignity of the individuals tested. A positive initial screeningtest is followed by a more specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometryconfirmation test. Persons who confirm positive must be removed from theirsensitive safety- or security-related position. They can be reinstatedonly upon successful completion of a rehabilitation program and a returnto duty test. The rules encourage, but do not require employers to establishrehabilitation programs. Most testing will begin in December 1989. Smallcompanies have an extra year to imlement drug testing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">XI. Appendix C_NHTSA Conclusion on IID's</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Ignition interlock technology based on breath alcohol testdevices for detecting and preventing alcohol-impaired driving does appearfeasible at this time. Devices that measure a driver's BAC level are currentlybeing marketed and used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Laboratory tests have shown the current breath test ignitioninterlock devices, when set to interlock at 0.03 percent BAC, to be relativelyaccurate in detecting low (i.e., 0.04 percent BAC) as well as high driverBAC levels. The accuracy and reliability of these devices under real-worldconditions is unknown. There is no apparent reason why any operationalproblems cannot easily be overcome.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The devices contain anti-tampering and circumvention measuresthat appear to reduce the likelihood of many forms of tampering and circumvention.Such activity by users is not impossible, but operational experience andtesting will indicate the extent to which tampering and circumvention willbe a problem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Current interest has focused on applying this technologyto convicted DWI offenders as a condition of probation or to obtain a restricteddriving privilege. Critical information necessary to estimate the potentialeffectiveness of these devices in this application is lacking. This includeswhether the devices function properly under real-world conditions and evidencethat persons required to use the devices do not tamper or circumvent theiruse and do not elect to operate other vehicles when drinking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; There is not yet enough evidence available to judge how effectivethese devices will be in deterring alcohol-impaired driving and relatedcrashes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; It is not appropriate for these devices to be used in lieuof other sanctions that have evidence of beneficial effects (e.g., licensesuspension). Use of this technology as an additional condition of probationor for reinstatement of a restricted driving privilege does appear appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The use of these devices with other populations may be feasible(e.g., fleet owners could install them, commercial and public transportationvehicles could be equipped, and individuals interested in this protectioncould pay for their installation). Widespread use of this type would haveto overcome resistance due to the costs, liability issues, and public acceptabilityissues. Also, considerable research is needed to ascertain the practicalityof these uses of the devices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Ignition interlock technology for detecting and preventingdrug-impaired driving does not appear feasible at this time. There is noeasy or feasible in-vehicle test method currently known to detect the useof drugs. In addition, the cost and complexity of testing for differentdrugs thought to impair driving skill (including legal as well as illegaldrugs), makes such an approach even more impractical.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The most immediate issues outstanding regarding the use of breathtest ignition interlock technology with convicted DWI offenders are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Their operational performance in the real world (i.e., theiraccuracy, reliability, maintenance and calibration requirements);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The extent to which the devices are tampered with, circumvented,or non-equipped vehicles are used by persons ordered to only drive carswith ignition interlock devices installed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The effectiveness of these devices in reducing alcohol-impaireddriving; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The certification standards adopted by the states authorizinguse of the devices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NHTSA research will help address these needs:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; NHTSA is currently initiating a project to develop modelperformance guidelines and test procedures that states can use in developingtheir own certification standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; NHTSA is providing grant funds to California to support theirongoing evaluation of their ignition interlock program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; NHTSA will provide technical assistance to states or localcommunities interested in evaluating the effectiveness of their ignitioninterlock program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-25802 Filed 10-31-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-62-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
