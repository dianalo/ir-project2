The report, which was released Wednesday, said nearly all smallbodies of water in central Europe are so badly contaminated thatthey can no longer be used for drinking water. It also said theactual damage could be much worse because the research was basedmainly on information provided by the countries involved.   ``In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said KaarleKenttamies, head of the Finnish Environment Ministry team whichconducted the survey for the U.N.-sponsored Convention onLong-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.   ``In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions suchas Scandinavia and southernmost Europe, there is still hope,'' hetold The Associated Press.   ``But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central Europe,are dead, and only a 100 percent drop in sulfur emissions can savethem,'' he said. He also said dumping heavy doses of lime couldalso help reduce acidity.   The year-long research project showed nearly all smaller bodiesof water in central Europe can no longer be used as sources ofdrinking water, Kenttamies said.   Acid rain carries a high concentration of acids produced bysulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other chemicals emitted duringthe burning of fossil fuels. The U.N.-sponsored conference, whichdrew participants from the United States, the Soviet Union and ninewest European nations, urged the Economic Commission for Europe toadopt stricter measures to fight pollution caused by nitrogen andsulfur emissions.   The commission's member countries have decided to start a jointinternational pollution monitoring project in 1989 to studyenvironmental changes caused by acid rain.   ``Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly inthe United States and Great Britain, we can can safely say thatacidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the1980s,'' Kenttamies said.   President Reagan has been criticized by environmentalists forfailing to do more to solve the problem of acid rain during his twoterms in office. In August, however, he gave the go-ahead forcontinuing negotiations toward U.S. participation in aninternational treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acidrain.      Kenttamies rejected as ``nonsense'' the argument that noconclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stationscontribute heavily to acid rain.   ``Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been toenough conventions like the one here today to know that we havesuch conclusive evidence,'' he said.   The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countrieswhich rely heavily on fossil fuels. Britain and Poland, both heavycoal users, are the only European nations which refused to join ina project to reduce sulfur emissions by 30 percent of 1980 levelsby 1993.   Acid rain in Scandinavia, mostly from industrial centers ineastern and western Europe, also has contaminated lakes and forests.   Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in whathad been considered virgin Lapland in northern Finland caused byhuge Soviet copper and nickel works in the Kola Peninsula.</TEXT></DOC>
