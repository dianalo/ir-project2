<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0986 </DOCNO><TEXT>Much of the acid rain debate between the US and Canada has centered onthe extent of damage caused by emissions from the US to sensitive ecologicalregions of Canada. This issue has also permeated deliberations of theUS Congress concerning the need for an emission reduction program. Whateffect would reducing US emissions have on ecological damage in the USand Canada? Although information is not yet available to reliably estimatedamages to certain receptors, changes in deposition can, with appropriatecaveats, be estimated with available models of long-range atmospherictransport, transformation, and deposition. Most modeling studies of long-rangetransport have emphasized the deposition patterns in sensitive areasassociated with various source regions. Several recent legal proceedings,however, have focused on the issues of net transboundary mass fluxesof pollutants. In this paper, the Advanced Statistical Trajectory RegionalAir Pollution (ASTRAP) model is used to estimate possible changes inthe flux of sulfur species from the US to Canada. Several scenarios offuture US emissions of sulfur dioxide are considered. The interannual,climatologically induced variability of transboundary fluxes is alsoaddressed.</TEXT></DOC>
