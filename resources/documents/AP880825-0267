The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 17-32 point, orabout $5.30 for every $1,000 in face amount.   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is anindicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.45 percent from 9.40percent late Wednesday.   The central banks of Britain, West Germany and several otherEuropean countries raised key interest rates Thursday in responseto the dollar's recent strength.   The coordinated steps pushed the dollar downward, and set anegative tone as trading opened in the bond market, said ElizabethG. Reiners, vice president for money market research at theinvestment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   The Federal Reserve recently raised its discount rate, theinterest it charges its member banks, and traders feared theoverseas rate hikes might prompt the Fed to increase the rateagain. That would force bond prices lower.   The bond market was dealt a bigger blow, however, when theCommerce Department issued its revised gross national productfigures for the second quarter.   The department said the economy expanded at a robust annual rateof 3.3 percent from April through June despite the severe impact ofthe drought on farm production. That was up from an earlierestimate of 3.1 percent.   What hurt bonds was a GNP price index, which rose at an annualrate of 5.1 percent during the quarter, the sharpest increase sincea 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982.   The 30-year Treasury issue fell nearly a point on the news, Mrs.Reiners said. The market has been sensitive to reports aboutinflation because the Federal Reserve has tightened credit in anattempt at keeping inflation in check.   Prices recovered, however, as traders had second thoughts aboutthe GNP report, Mrs. Reiners said.   ``Most people realize it's second quarter data, only throughJune,'' she said. And with the recent interest rate hikes in thiscountry, ``possibly there'll be some abatement in the economy,''she said.   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices ofshort-term government issues were [ point to 7-32 point lower,intermediate maturities ranged 9-32 point to ] point lower, and20-year issues were 13-32 point lower, according to figuresprovided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measuresprice movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturitiesof a year or longer, fell 2.66 to 1,123.07.   Corporate bonds also were down. Moody's Investment GradeCorporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down0.60 to 281.51.   Municipal bonds slipped as well. The Bond Buyer Municipal BondIndex slipped 7-32 point to 88 16-32, while its yield rose to 8.16percent from late Wednesday's 8.14 percent.   Yields on Treasury bills moved higher. Three-month bills rose 3basis points to a discounted rate of 7.28 percent and a yield of7.51 percent. Six-month bills were up 3 basis points to adiscounted rate of 7.48 percent to yield 7.87 percent, and one-yearbills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.71 percent anda yield of 8.27 percent.   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yieldis the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. Thediscounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, was quoted at 8\ percent, up from 7 13-16 percent lateWednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
