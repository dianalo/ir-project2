The values obtainedagree with the results of earlier HF solution calorimetry, when available.The heat of formation from the oxides generally becomes more negativethe closer the tolerance factor for that perovskite is to unity. Theheat of formation can be divided into two contributions, that from changesin electrostatic (Madelung) energy, which becomes more negative as thetolerance factor decreases from 1 to {similar_to}0.8, reflecting a smallervolume for the perovskite, and that from other energy terms, mainly repulsiveinteractions. The change in these terms is generally positive, reflectinggreater repulsion in the perovskite structure than in the binary oxides,and increases with increasing deviation of the tolerance factor fromunity. These energy terms also correlate with the apparent contractionof the octahedral sublattice relative to that calculated for ideal geometry.From the heats of solution of the polymorphs of CdTiO{sub 3} and BaTiO{sub3}, the heat of transition between ilmenite- and perovskite-type CdTiO{sub3} and that between perovskite- and high-temperature hexagonal-type BaTiO{sub3} were calculated to be 8.2 +/0 2.3 and 5.6 +/0 3.4 kJ/mole.</TEXT></DOC>
