COPS INDICTED IN BEATING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related article on page 17A  </MEMO><TEXT>     Information about the indictments came out as pressure mounted on LosAngeles police Chief Daryl F. Gates to resign, but Gates promised to fight anyouster attempt, saying &quot;I didn't invest 42 years of my life to go down thetubes over an incident that I had nothing to do with.&quot;;    According to theirattorneys, four of the 15 officers present at the beating had been indictedand were ordered to surrender in court today -- Sgt. Stacey Koon, 40, veteranofficers Ted Briseno, 38, and Laurence Powell, 28, and Timothy Wind, 30, arookie still on probation.;    The 23-member panel began hearing evidenceMonday in the case, which came to light when a witness to the early-morningincident March 3 presented a videotape to a Los Angeles television station.;   The images of uniformed officers repeatedly kicking and striking the prone,unarmed man have sparked outrage nationwide.;    At least 400 people turnedout Thursday for a police commission hearing, heckling Gates and cheering on asuccession of black community leaders and residents who called for hisdismissal. Gates, who sat somberly through the session, later repeated hisintention to remain as chief of the 8,300-member department.;    'No cause tofire me';  &quot;I am so confident about that that I am willing to undergo any kindof test they want to put me through,&quot; Gates said. &quot;But I think they are goingto find there is no cause to fire me.&quot;;    Later Thursday, Gates toldreporters that he would only step down if he lost the confidence of therank-and-file officers. He also vowed to fight any attempt to remove him --which under the city charter would require a showing of gross misconduct orother cause.;    &quot;If they begin to impeach me, I'd be delighted to meet thatchallenge,&quot; he said. &quot;And quite frankly, I'd beat that challenge.&quot;;    All 15officers present at the assault on Rodney G. King, 25, who is on parole aftera robbery conviction, have been removed from active field duty by Gates.;   Skull broken in 9 places;    King, whose skull was broken in nine places wasreported in good condition after surgery Thursday, said a spokeswoman forKing's attorney, Steve Lerman.;    Despite a statement last week by King thathe did not view the incident as racially motivated, most of those who spoke atthe hearing left no doubt that they considered the incident part of a patternof violent racism within the Police Department.;    &quot;We cannot express to you-- it is impossible to command the words -- the outrage we feel,&quot; said JohnMack, the president of the Urban League of Los Angeles. &quot;We believe this is apattern, not an aberration, a pattern of brutality by some but not all policeofficers against African-American males in particular.&quot;;    Campaign to oustchief;  The pressure on Gates, according to the Los Angeles Times, has led toa behind-the-scenes campaign, directed by Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani, designedto exert so much political and public pressure on Gates that he eventuallywill give up his post for the good of the police department and thecommunity.;    &quot;We have received literally thousands of letters and phonecalls, and a vast majority have sought the chief's resignation,&quot; Fabiani said.&quot;This is clearly a broad-based outcry on the part of all segments of thecommunity and it's growing. We see no signs here at City Hall that people'sanger is diminishing.&quot;;    The Federal Bureau of Investigation also ispressing ahead with its investigation of the incident, an unusual developmentin that the federal agency usually refrains from duplicating the efforts oflocal investigators.;    Videotape was crucial;  Witnesses before the grandjury included the man who made the videotape from a nearby balcony;eyewitnesses from the same apartment building; a Los Angeles Unified SchoolDistrict officer who was present, and at least two Los Angeles policeofficers.;    The central piece of evidence, however, is most certainly thevideotape. In the two-minute tape, a sergeant is shown holding a stun gun fromwhich a barb had been shot into King early in the incident. As he and otherslook on, at least three officers appear to take turns beating King withnightsticks and kicking him. Gates said the man had been struck more than 50times.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  777  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075143,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
