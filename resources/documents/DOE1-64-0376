<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0376 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors give explicit formulas for the decays of the Higgs bosonsof the minimal supersymmetric model to neutralinos and charginos. Theimportant features of these decays are illustrated and their phenomenologicalimplications discussed. When phase space allowed, this class of two-bodydecays is at least as important as, and often dominates, other typesof Higgs decay modes, such as WW or ZZ and heavy fermion anti-fermionchannels.</TEXT></DOC>
