At the same time, Airbus announced a $960 million contractwith International Lease Finance Corp. of California, withfirm orders for nine planes and options on an additional six.The purchase, announced at the Paris Air Show, comes onlydays after a Kuwait Airways order for up to 24 new Airbusjets, and amid speculation that Federal Express Corp. isplanning to buy wide-body Airbus A-300s.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, Boeing Co. said it received orders valued at atotal of $1.2 billion to build six 777 wide-body jets forThai Airways International, and two 747s jumbo jets forKorean Air.   Although Airbus's 150 billion lire ($112.5 million) offerto private investors doesn't necessarily signal the end ofits dependence on government funds, analysts said that itdoes reflect Airbus's growing confidence in its future.&quot;Whenever Airbus needed money before, it asked itsgovernments. Now it's asking the banks, and that marks arehabilitation,&quot; said Paul Compton, an aerospace analyst atUBS-Phillips andamp; Drew in London.   The money raised by the Airbus issue will help pay fordevelopment of the A-321 plane, a stretched version of theshort-haul A-320 airliner. Airbus, which has about a third ofthe world market for large jet airliners, currently hasorders for about 1,000 aircraft on its books.   With Airbus's success, the question of where theconsortium gets its funds has caused trade friction with theU.S. Rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp., with supportfrom Washington, say that the estimated $20 billion paid byEuropean governments over the last 20 years to developAirbus's family of jets represents unfair subsidies. Airbusdefends itself by describing the money as refundable loans,and counterattacks by saying the U.S. manufacturers receivesimilar support, albeit indirectly, through defense contractsfrom Washington.   Airbus, which was formed in the early 1970s, is aconsortium among Aerospatiale of France, British AerospacePLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and DeutscheAirbus, a unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. The fourpartners share production, building the separate componentsof each aircraft at their own factories, scattered acrossEurope, then shipping the elements to Toulouse, France, forfinal assembly.   The consortium doesn't publish any accounts, but earlierthis year Airbus officials said that it turned an operatingprofit for the first time in 1990, clearing between $100million and $150 million on sales of $4.6 billion.   For Boeing, meanwhile, yesterday's order from Thailand'snational airline was the fourth it has received for the 777,which was launched last October. The Thai Airways contract,valued at $900 million, includes spare parts and training, aswell as options to purchase an additional six 777s. The valueof the contract could rise to as much as $2 billion if allthe options are exercised, Boeing said. Deliveries arescheduled to begin in November 1995.   The Thai order brings the total number of commitments forthe 777 to 57 firm orders and 50 options. Boeing hasn'tdisclosed the total value of the commitments, which includeorders from UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, All Nippon Airwaysand Euralair, a French charter airline.   The Korean Air order, valued at about $300 million,includes one firm order and conversion of an option. Boeingsaid the planes will be delivered in early 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
