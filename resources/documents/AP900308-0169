The report concluded that even if most allegations made againstthe Georgia Republican were true, they would not violate Houserules.   The No. 2-ranking House Republican, who was the chief accuser inthe ethics case that triggered Democratic Speaker Jim Wright'sresignation last year, has called the case filed against him apolitical retaliation.   Gingrich said Thursday the report demonstrated the charges filedby Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., were ``politically inspirednonsense.''   He contended the ``political smear'' cost taxpayers at least$300,000 and himself more than $100,000 in legal fees. Jan Keyes,spokeswoman for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _the ethics panel's formal name _ said she could not verify the$300,000 cost.   Gingrich was criticized by the committee for failing to reporton his annual disclosure forms his joint purchase, with hisdaughter, of her home in Fulton County, Ga. in 1986.   He also was criticized for his staff's use of his officialletterhead in December 1986 and January 1987 to promote afor-profit cruise.   Gingrich was ordered to ``promptly amend'' his disclosurestatments to reflect purchase of the house and was warned of ``moresevere committee action'' if he fails to prevent future misdeeds byhis staff.   But Alexander's complaint was also criticized. ``Some of theassertions are pure speculation,'' the committee concluded.``Others advance unusual legal arguments not supported by priorcommittee interpretations.''   The most publicized issue in the case was whether Gingrichviolated outside income limits and rules against receiving giftsfrom those with a direct interest in legislation.   The allegations focused on the ``COS Limited Partnership''Gingrich formed to promote a book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' hewrote with his wife and a third author. Alexander also questionedGingrich's royalty arrangement.   The committee found Gingrich properly listed as royalties the$24,036 he and his wife received from book sales and advances.Alexander questioned whether Gingrich exceeded outside incomelimits with the payments, but the committee concluded the royaltieswere exempted from the ceiling.   The committee also rejected Alexander's allegation that the$105,000 raised from the 21 ``COS'' investors to promote the bookcould be considered ``gifts'' from people seeking legislativefavors from Gingrich.   ``The partners may simply have been seeking, in addition tomaking investments, advancing the political or philosophicalpolicies which Rep. Gingrich advocated in the book,'' the committeesaid. Gingrich is the leader of conservative Republicans in theHouse.   ``In sum, the committee is of the firm view that no adequatebasis exists for initiating a preliminary inquiry'' in the case,the panel said, referring to the first phase of its investigativeprocess.   The committee set up what amounted to an initial investigationwhen it hired a Chicago law firm last July for advice on whether topursue the case. The firm recommended last October the case shouldbe dismissed due to lack of evidence that rules were broken.   The panel wrote Gingrich a letter on the home purchase and thetravel promotion, which paralleled its findings in the report.   ``You were remiss in your oversight and administration of yourcongressional office,'' the committee wrote in criticizing theletters promoting the cruise for senior citizens.   Gingrich on Thursday blamed the travel-promotion letters on astaffer _ ``a young man who made a mistake in judgment.''   The panel also wrote Gingrich that the joint purchase of hisdaughter's home ``as well as the underlying liability you incurred,should have been reported on your financial disclosure statements.''   The panel said it considered _ and rejected _ Gingrich'scontention that he was only a guarantor of the loan and signeddocuments only as an accommodation for his daughter.   Gingrich said Thursday he failed to report that he co-signed themortgage stemmed because he misread of House rules.</TEXT></DOC>
