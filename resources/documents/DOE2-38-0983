The analysis of topologicalpeculiarities of magnetic fields shows that a three-dimensional generalizationof the line of X-type neutral points, namely separator, can appear andvanish with the evolution of sunspots arrangement. A three-dimensionalmagnetic field neutral line can exist even if the sunspots do not lieon a straight line. An isolated neutral point of magnetic field can appearon the separator above the plane of location of sunspots, and a smallchange of sunspots arrangement causes a great displacement of neutralpoint along the separator.</TEXT></DOC>
