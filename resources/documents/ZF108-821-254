 The 9370 will be replaced by the 9221 family;the 4381 will be succeeded by the 9121 family; and the 3090 will give way tothe 9021 family.andP;  Based on rumours that can be traced back to leaks fromIBM's sales force - the peddlers were told about the machines on Wednesday,August 22 - it appears that IBM will be unable to ship a truly new generationof mainframe processors until the fourth quarter of 1991.andP;  Even then, onlytwo models - a four-engined processor and a six-engined processor - arelikely to be in Big Blue's line-up.andP;  In the interim, the manufacturer willsell customers repackaged versions of 3090 mainframes.andP;  These mainframes willuse CPU technology identical to that in the 3090-J series but will offer someenhancements in the form of optional features such as glass rather thancopper input-output cabling.andP;  The new mainframes need thicker pipes forchilled water (2&quot; versus 1.5&quot;) but will use somewhat less power due to achange in memory technology.andP;  Optimistic observers suggest that IBM couldannounce more new processors before the end of 1991, killing the 3090 clones.andO;However, IBM can only do so if it no longer needs to sell the recast 3090mainframes.andP;  This means that IBM will only announce real 9021s below thefour-banger level if it can ship iron promptly - or if sales of theold-technology systems have already ground to a halt.andP;  IBM's really newmachines will be the four-processor, 161 MIPS 9021-820 and the six-processor,212 MIPS 9021-900.andP;  These machines will be promised to some users under earlysupport agreements for mid-1991.andP;  Regular deliveries will commence during thefourth quarter.-andM;By Hesh WienerandM;Only old-technology 9021s can be upgraded to new-technology 9021s; owners of3090s will have to buy multiple upgrades or just swap out old equipment toget new 9021s.andP;  Pricing information was not available to us at press time.andO;Even IBM's sales force seemed to be in the dark about IBM's list prices.andO;This leads us to believe that the big debate was raging right down to thewire: should IBM slash list prices and minimise discounts...andP;  or keep listprices artificially high and sell at deep discounts as it did with the 3090?andO;The 3090-technology machines in the 9021 line include six models.andP;  There aretwo uniprocessors: the 330, at 20 MIPS - a remake of the 170J - and the 340,at 24 MIPS - a recast 180J.andP;  IBM will unveil one dyadic machine: the model500, which, at 45 MIPS, is essentially a 3090-200J.andP;  IBM will offer toupgrade installed 3090 models 170J and 180J to 9021-500s.andP;  The triadic model580 - at 65 MIPS a recast 300J - is available directly or as an upgrade toinstalled 3090-200J processors.andP;  The four-engined model 620 has the 85 MIPSof a 3090-400J.andP;  It is optionally available as an upgrade to an installed3090-200J.andP;  The top of the old-technology 9021 line is the model 720.andP;  Withsix engines and capable of 112 MIPS, the 720 has the same power as the3090-600J on which its processor is based.andP;  Field upgrades will be availableto owners of 3090 models 300J, 400J, 500J and 600J.andP;  All the old-technologymachines should be shipped in limited quantities by year-end.andP;  Upgrades of3090s to 9021s will become available during the first several months of 1991.andO;The exact availabilities will vary depending on the source and targetmachines.andP;  All the 9021s will use new power units - for the first time basedon 230-volt 60-cycle three-phase current rather than the old 415-volttechnology.andP;  There will also be a new coolant distribution box and someadditional system components.andM;ClustersandM;One new box will eventually serve to synchronise processor clusters.andP;  Anotherwill provide switching between processors with both old-style and fibre opticchannel cabling and peripheral device controllers.andP;  There will be six modelsin the air-cooled 9121 midrange line.andP;  Four of the machines areuniprocessors: the 8 MIPS model 190, the 12 MIPS model 210, the 16 MIPS model280 and the 23 MIPS model 320.andP;  Above these machines lie the dual-processor32 MIPS model 440 and the dual-processor 40 MIPS model 480.andP;  There will notbe field upgrades of 4381s to these new machines, but within the 9121 therewill be full model-to-model upgrades (except, we understand, a model320-to-model 440 upgrade).andP;  The smallest new 370-architecture systems, the9221s, will encompass four boxes: the model 120 at 2 MIPS, the model 130 at 3MIPS, the model 150 at 5 MIPS and the model 170 at 6.5 MIPS.andP;  There may wellbe field upgrades or trade-in options to ease migration from some 9221s tosome 9121s.andP;  All these air-cooled systems should be shipped in short order,with volume production no later than first quarter 1991.andM;Summary of announcement expected on September 5andM;Model Processors MIPS Equivalent toandM;Summit 9021-900 Six 212 9021-820 Four 161andM;3090 9021-720 Six 20 3090-600J 9021-620 Four 85 3090-400J 9021-580 Three 653090-300J 9021-500 Two 45 3090-200J 9021-340 One 24 3090-180J 9021-330 One 203090-170J &quot;4391&quot;
