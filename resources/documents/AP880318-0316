WAKIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The founder and ex-president of anirradiation company and a leading spokesman for the foodpreservation process was indicted Friday on charges he orderedworkers to bypass safety precautions and lied about it to federalregulators.   The company, Radiation Technology Inc. of Morris Plains,Wednesday pleaded guilty to related charges involving violations atits Rockaway plant. RTI irradiates medical products and spices.   Company founder Martin Welt had planned to plead guilty tounspecified charges in the case the same day but withdrew from aplea agreement at the last moment, said prosecutors in the U.S.attorney's Newark office.   Welt, 55, of Denville, withdrew as RTI's president in mid-1986after the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission temporarilysuspended the company's license for the safety violations.   He has been one of the process's most vocal supporters, toutingit in the media and making a promotional trip to China last year.Welt also was a physicist with the NRC's predecessor, the AtomicEnergy Commission.   Also named in the 11-count indictment was William Jouris, 48, ofLittleton, Mass. In 1985, Jouris was a resident nuclear engineerand operations manager at the Rockaway plant, the indictment said.   Welt and Jouris were charged with conspiracy to defraud the NRC,making false statements and violating the Atomic Energy Act. Weltalso was charged with obstruction of justice.   Welt's attorney, Theodore H. Wells, said he had not seen theindictment and could not comment. He also refused to comment on theapparent breakdown in plea negotiations. Welt did not return amessage left on his answering machine.   Jouris could not be reached for comment. He did not return amessage left on his home answering machine. Attorney RobertFettweis, who prosecutors said has represented Jouris, did notreturn a message left at his office.   The indictment said the defendants bypassed or told others tobypass ``conveyor door safety interlocks'' at the Rockaway plant.The devices automatically lower the radiation source, in this caseCobalt 60, into a protective pool when a human or an object otherthan the product to be irradiated enters the area.   Welt ordered the locks routinely bypassed starting in April1984, the indictment said, and sought to impede an NRCinvestigation into the matter.   The criminal investigation grew out of the NRC probe, which ledto a pair of temporary license suspensions in 1986.   Welt called a meeting and threatened RTI workers with dismissalif they didn't lie to investigators, the indictment said.   Jouris was accused of removing a radiation safety monitor thatprevented workers from being inadvertently exposed to radiation.   The company has said no worker or member of the public washarmed because of the violations.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Wolff said authoritiesknow of at least one worker who entered the cell area whileproducts were being irradiated, but said the worker suffered noimmediate injury.   She said it was difficult to measure the health affects of thesafety violations because the results of low-level dosages don'tappear until years later.   She said the safety interlocks frequently malfunctioned,preventing the irradiation process from going on, so companyofficials bypassed them to keep operating.   The indictment said Jouris and Welt lied to the NRC about theinstallation of a new conveyor door safety system at the Rockawayplant, telling regulators during a routine inspection that it hadtested a new system in tandem with the old system for two weeksbefore dismantling the old one.   Instead, the indictment charged, the old system was taken apartand the new one installed without testing.   Welt faces up to 37 years in prison if convicted and Jourisfaces 22 years.   RTI also has operations in Salem, N.J., West Memphis, Ark., andHaw River, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
