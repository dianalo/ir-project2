(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Disk utilities: More than crash recovery toolsandM;By Amy BermarandM;Most people buy hard disk utility tools in a hurry, for two simple reasons.andO;&quot;Their hard drive just crashed, or they know someone whose drive justcrashed,&quot; said Lee Lensky, director of Symantec Corp.'s Macintosh utilitiesgroup, which makes SUM II.andM;Jay Fader, president of Eastern Storefront Co.andP;  Inc., based in Brooklyn,N.Y., might be considered an exception to thiscrash-recovery/crash-protection school of purchasing.andP;  He bought SUM twoyears ago and gradually learned to use its varied features.andP;  When Fader's80-Mbyte drive suddenly abandoned ship earlier this summer, he knew enoughnot to panic.andM;&quot;I got a media error,&quot; he recalled calmly, using the term that announces whatis usually a disk-management disaster.andP;  &quot;I couldn't boot the system off thehard disk, and I couldn't boot it off a floppy.andP;  It was like I had no disk atall.&quot;andM;Obviously, any hard disk utility package with a data-recovery tool earns itskeep the first time it reverses this kind of catastrophe.andM;Portfolios of applications.andP;  The majority of the leading tools, which rangein price from less than $100 to about $160, do far more than merely restorelost data.andM;Symantec's SUM II and Norton Utilities for the Macintosh (Norton Computingwas acquired by Symantec at the end of August) and Central Point SoftwareInc.'s MacTools Deluxe represent the growing number of utilities that offer aportfolio of management tools, ranging from data encryption to a quickenedfloppy disk copying function.andM;Other products hone in on one aspect of disk management.andP;  1stAid Kit from1stAid Software specifically diagnoses and recommends several courses ofaction for various causes of damage.andP;  Other products by the company aretailored to tackle different sources of disk trouble by blocking outunreadable sectors and resurrecting deleted files, for example.andM;Still, 1stAid Software bowed to market pressures by bundling its products --1stAid, Complete Undelete and Sector Collector -- in Deluxe 1stAid Kit.andO;Microcom Inc. bought 1stAid Software and is marketing it as 911 Utilities andadding Virex to it.andM;Sources of error.andP;  Most users rely heavily on just three disk-managementfunctions: data recovery, backup and disk optimization.andM;Data recovery is most dramatic.andP;  Information can become damaged for a numberof reasons, and disk-management programs use a variety of techniques toretrieve the injured data.andM;&quot;Any part of the first few blocks of a disk can get messed up, and that'swhere all of the information is [that's] about boot blocks, catalogs, extenttrees and the volume information,&quot; said Tom Swinford, product manager ofCentral Point's MacTools Deluxe, which was introduced in late June to replacethe company's 2-year-old product, PC Tools for the Mac, and retails for $129.andO;&quot;If any program goes astray and writes to these blocks, you get damage.&quot;andM;External factors also can damage a disk: Power outages are risky if theyoccur while a disk is in midst of being written to, Swinford said, becausethe critical information used to locate files may not be stored correctly.andM;The hardware can fail, as can the medium itself; this occurs when sectors, orblocks, no longer hold their charge.andP;  Some sectors are only marginallydamaged; they'll be able to hold information one time, but not another.andP;  Mostdefragmentation programs identify these unusable sectors as a single groupand direct the system to avoid writing to them in the future.andM;Restoring data.andP;  The quickest way to restore lost data is by searching forkey &quot;signatures&quot; that identify the file's application format.andM;Two other methods require scanning the whole disk.andP;  A slightly abbreviatedapproach scans directories, while the slowest method searches every file onthe disk.andP;  Users report that this end-to-end scan can take from less than ahalf hour to several hours, depending on the size of the disk.andM;If the damage is only in the boot blocks or directories, these sometimes canbe repaired without scanning the individual files on the disk, and you don'tlose your folder hierarchy.andM;&quot;The signature scan is good for a floppy,&quot; said Symantec's Lensky,&quot;particularly if you just need a single file.andP;  But if someone's got a100-Mbyte hard drive, most users want the entire disk back with nocompromises.&quot;andM;Yet even the manufacturers concede that not every disk can be fully restored.andO;Most say they report about an 85 percent success rate.andM;In addition to data recovery, users say they want two other features in adisk-management program: backup and disk optimization.andM;Optimization.andP;  &quot;Disk optimizers read the software, shuffle the stuff aroundand replace it in an orderly fashion,&quot; said Dave Drucker, a Mac consultantand database programmer in Cambridge, Mass.andM;Many users say they use this feature every month or two, and power users saythey can detect improved performance.andP;  Both SUM II and Norton Utilities offerthis feature, as do some stand-alone products, such as Disk Express II fromALSoft Inc. of Spring, Texas.andM;&quot;Optimization does two things,&quot; said Drucker.andP;  &quot;It speeds up access time ifyou have a lot of input and output, and it lets you get back a little diskspace.&quot;andM;Only Disk Express II can perform this function on the fly.andP;  But automatingoptimization also poses a risk: Deleted files soon may be written over,eliminating the chance of their recovery.andP;  Drucker and several other userssaid that they prefer to activate optimization manually.andM;&quot;I set the time aside and go get a cup of coffee,&quot; said Drucker, whotypically finds that about 5 percent of his disk is badly fragmented.andO;&quot;Optimizing my 100-Mbyte drive takes about 15 minutes.&quot;andM;Backup.andP;  Seasoned users back up their data systematically, whether it'sautomated to occur every night or just once a week.andP;  However, NortonUtilities and MacTools lack this function.andP;  The real problems arise whencurrent backup copies of files don't exist.andM;&quot;Of course, if people backed up on a regular basis, the need for thesedisk-management products would really shrink,&quot; said Rich Coulombre, an ownerof The Support Group Inc., a training center in Newton, Mass., which chargescustomers $75 an hour to restore damaged files.andP;  &quot;If you've only lost anhour's worth of work, it's usually easier to redo the work.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
