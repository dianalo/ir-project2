Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Augusta, Ga.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Our civilization owes much to golf. It's more than likely, for example, that such concepts as the &quot;gimme&quot; and the &quot;mulligan&quot; have made us more generous than we otherwise might be.    On the stricter side is golf's standard of &quot;par,&quot; the number of strokes an excellent player should take to negotiate a hole, or a whole course of them. Rightly or wrongly, it has come to be applied to a wide range of activities with no links to the links.    When it comes to golf's &quot;majors&quot; -- the four annual tournaments the winning of which has become &quot;par&quot; for entrance to the sport's elite -- par has become a battleground, defended by course-proud members of the clubs on which they are contended, and attacked by score-proud pros. If you're a fan, you know that the clubs usually win. The hand that guides the sprinkler and mower rules the scoreboard.    Sandy Lyle, an Englishman by birth and residence but a Scot by blood and choice, won the Masters tournament, a major to the core, by a stroke here Sunday. He did it in dramatic fashion, holing a downhill, 10-foot birdie putt on the 72nd and last hole. That came after he considerately made things exciting for audiences present and unseen by hacking things up a bit on the back nine and squandering a fair-sized lead.    For the previous three days at the Augusta National golfing shrine, however, the news was not the golf but the greens. They were too dry, too short, too hard, too fast, too goldarned difficult, the golfers moaned after watching their putts slide by the cups and their scores soar.    How hard were the greens? &quot;Like pool tables sprinkled with potato-chip crumbs,&quot; said young pro Gary Hallberg, the chip phrase being a reference to the dead-grass debris that coated the drier greens on sunny late afternoons. &quot;Like a Formica countertop someone spilled salt on,&quot; offered Ray Floyd, the 1976 winner here. &quot;Like that wall over there,&quot; roared Fuzzy Zoeller, another ex-champ (1979) and leader of the outcry.    The green-jacketed men who run the tournament tut-tutted that nothing unusual was afoot, or under it. The contestants &quot;have been playing so many courses not set up like this that they are not used to it, not since the last major,&quot; said chairman Hord Hardin. On his side was the undeniable fact that some golfing tourists gripe about any course on which they can't shoot a 66 with six clubs in their bags. To the eye of this former municipal-course player, Augusta National looks like Valhalla, with fairways better than the greens in most places and &quot;rough&quot; that would make a lovely fairway anywhere else.    But the fact that the charge of &quot;tricking up&quot; a course (Zoeller's words) was raised at august Augusta National, and by golfers whose reverence for the game is well known, gave it credence. &quot;There were putts out there you couldn't allow yourself to think of making,&quot; said Ben Crenshaw, another former Masters champ (1984) and a thoroughgoing traditionalist. &quot;When you were above some of the holes, you just breathed on the ball and hoped it would stop around the cup.&quot;    Someone gets first prize in every golf tournament whether his four-round score is 260 or 290, but the pros' revolt at least shed light on an otherwise puzzling aspect of golf. Better athlete conditioning and equipment have helped rewrite the records in just about every other sport, but golf's scores haven't changed much from bygone eras. Lyle's 72-hole score of 281, seven under par, was the same as George Archer's winning total in 1969, one stroke better than Herman Keiser's in 1946, and two strokes worse than Claude Harmon's in 1948. We're not talkin' Nelson, Snead or Hogan here, and today we've got such modern marvels as Nautilus workouts and metal-headed &quot;woods.&quot; Also, it seems, we've got &quot;tricked up&quot; golf courses.    Given that backdrop, it's fitting that the Masters' latest winner is Lyle, a young (30) but seasoned player who has earned his spikes by winning tourneys as separate as the Nigerian Open, in 1978, and the Greater Greensboro Open the week before last. He's a tall fellow with a powerful, erect swing, deft putting touch and stoic temperament suited to golf in extremis.    He proved that with his victory in the 1985 British Open at Sandwich, England, under weather conditions too brutal to be described in a family newspaper. That he also can triumph on nice days is attested by his three wins, and PGA-tour-leading $591,821 in earnings, in this young year.    Lyle came to the last day of play at 210 strokes, two fewer than the veteran Crenshaw and Mark Calcavecchia, a long-hitting, 28-year-old Floridian making his first serious run at a major crown. Within three more strokes were five others, including ex-champs Seve Ballesteros (1980 and '83), Craig Stadler ('82), Bernhard Langer ('85) and the outspoken Zoeller.    The first to make a charge was Greg Norman, an Australian who has a way of figuring in these affairs. He started the day at 221, but roared in with a 64, including a front-nine 30. The next-best score by a fella with a chance was a 68 by the mustached, rotund Stadler. After Lyle dunked a tee shot for a double-bogey five on the 12th hole, his only major lapse, Stadler and Calcavecchia were tied for the lead at six under par to Lyle's five.    But Lyle, playing in the day's final twosome, recouped by birdieing two of the last three holes. He sunk a 15-foot putt for a two on 16, and got a three on 18 after a miraculous, seven-iron &quot;out&quot; from a fairway trap and a 10-foot putt. In a tourney marked by players agonizing over slippery four- and five-foot putts, he sank a bundle of 'em, three-putting only twice in 72 holes.    Calcavecchia finished second by a stroke, playing the last 11 holes in four under par, and vowed he'd be back to challenge here again. One can only believe him. Lyle, who said on Saturday that somebody's going to win no matter what the course conditions, said on Sunday he was glad it was he. One can believe that, too. </TEXT></DOC>
