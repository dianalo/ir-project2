As a matter of constitutional law,the result is simply too preposterous to survive long as aprecedent for other cases. The decision should be viewed,rather, as another byway in the court's and the nation'stortured but valiant struggle with the issue of race.   Missouri v. Jenkins is not likely to mean we have a newrule of law that unelected federal judges may order taxlevies by local officials to pay for judicially preferredsocial programs -- housing, welfare, environmentalism, highersalaries for judges. Americans long ago gave a lesson inBoston Harbor about what we think about taxation withoutrepresentation. Most federal judges will understand thataccepting an invitation to order tax increases risks thenobility of the law and ultimately the independence of thejudiciary. In any event, with Chief Justice Rehnquist and thethree young Reagan Justices joining in an outraged dissent,any Bush Justice is likely to be the swing vote back on thenext test case.</LP><TEXT>   What, then, to make of this opinion? As Justice AnthonyKennedy noted in the dissent (excerpts nearby), this casecannot be understood outside its facts. Federal DistrictCourt Judge Russell Clark has spent a decade deciding how tointegrate the public schools in Kansas City, Missouri. Thefrustrations of this kind of litigation invite blinkered,prime-directive reasoning. Here, the directive was to createracial balance in the schools, regardless of cost.   When white flight left too few whites to make integrationpossible, Judge Clark decided he had to lure whites back witha magnet-school program. He demanded an estimated $500million to $700 million to make the schools the best-endowedpublic schools in the country. The voters disagreed,repeatedly voting down taxes to fund the enticement of whitestudents with natatoriums, model U.N.s, aestheticallypleasing carpets and 15 computers per classroom. Votersdumped tea bags on Judge Clark's courthouse steps.   The Missouri Constitution required a two-thirds vote toraise property taxes, but over the half-dozen tax-levypropositions, voters never went beyond a bare majority. Thelocal school board, which wanted the huge new budget, didn'thave the power to get around this limitation. So in 1987,Judge Clark simply ordered that the local property tax bedoubled. By a 9-0 vote, the Justices agreed that he went toofar by directly ordering this tax.   But by a 5-4 vote, they said Judge Clark could order thetax indirectly by &quot;authorizing and directing&quot; -- that is,ordering -- local officials to raise the tax, despite thestate Constitution saying they don't have the power. In anycase, if it was unconstitutional for Judge Clark to levy thetax in the open, how can it be constitutional to do the samething behind a mask?   In the final section of his dissent, Justice Kennedydisclosed the most important single fact about the majorityopinion. He said it can be understood only as a special casebecause the subject matter is race. &quot;The historical record ofvoluntary compliance with the decree of Brown v. Board ofEducation is not a proud chapter in our constitutionalhistory,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The judges of the district courts andcourts of appeals have been courageous and skillful inimplementing its mandate.&quot; But &quot;while few ends are moreimportant than enforcing the guarantee of equal educationalopportunity,&quot; he wrote, good ends cannot justifyunconstitutional means.   This nation can by and large be proud of its efforts todeal with the racial issue; we can count considerable ifincomplete progress in an area where most societies havefailed or feared to tread. The courts have played anespecially important role; with other political institutionsunable to move, the judicial activism of Brown v. Board ofEducation surely had a moral justification. But itnonetheless carried a legal risk, inviting judges to try toremove every blot on the body politic.   Even on the issue of race, public sentiments have changed,and the legislative and executive branches pass and enforcecivil-rights laws. It has become increasingly evident thatjudicial fiat, not given to dealing with social complexities,is not going to solve the remaining problems. This isironically illustrated in the Kansas City schools under JudgeClark's jurisdiction.   Black parents in Kansas City have sued because theirchildren have been denied admission to the local magnetschool. They were excluded because they would have upset thecourt-ordered racial statistics. In other words, blackparents have decided that the best hope for their children isquality education, not the company of white children. Yetthey are told they cannot attend the school of their choicebecause they have black skins.   If this is where we have arrived, surely it is time forjudges to back off from their activism. Certainly they shouldnot be rushing in to claim, of all things, the power oftaxation. Kings did not ultimately succeed in taxingAmericans without their consent, and neither will judges.</TEXT></DOC>
