The probe apparently will focus on employees of the Department of Trade and Industry, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading. These agencies all play a part in deciding whether a takeover bid or merger is allowed to proceed, based on antitrust or other considerations.    &quot;The appointment (of investigators) follows allegations that public servants may have misused information,&quot; Trade and Industry Minister Paul Channon said. He didn't elaborate, but a government spokesman confirmed that employees of the three agencies were the subject of the investigation.    The investigation marks the third recent inquiry by the government into possible insider trading in Britain. In the past five weeks, it launched investigations into the activities of Guinness PLC and former Morgan Grenfell Group PLC executive Geoffrey Collier. In addition, the London Stock Exchange recently started an investigation of a British andamp; Commonwealth Shipping Co. junior employee.    People with advance knowledge about whether a bid will be investigated or barred altogether would be at an advantage if they traded in the shares of the companies involved. Share prices are often dramatically affected by a referral of a bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation.    For example, the share price of Imperial Continental Gas Association suddenly fell the equivalent of 14 cents to $7.73 late in the afternoon of Dec. 9. The next morning, the government said it was referring Gulf Resources andamp; Chemical Corp.'s roughly $1.07 billion bid for the company to the commission, a move that caught most analysts by surprise. The bid automatically lapsed when it was referred to the commission.    Imperial Continental's share price fell to $6.87 immediately after the announcement, though it has since recovered to $8.39. An Imperial Continental spokesman said the company has no reason to believe the current investigation involves the Gulf Resources bid.    The investigation announced yesterday will be carried out by lawyer John Lindsay and by Peter Crozier, former head of the Inland Revenue Inquiry Branch. They have powers, granted to investigators only last month, to compel testimony and the production of documents.    Robin Cook, the Labor Party trade and industry spokesman, said the announcement gave &quot;dramatic support&quot; to the party's call for an independent regulatory body having no affiliation with either the government or British financial institutions. Under the current regulatory framework, financial institutions have initial responsibility for regulating themselves. </TEXT></DOC>
