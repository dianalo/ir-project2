Amid sharp criticism from Congress that the United States shouldhave stepped in to help topple Noriega, officials said theadministration was in the dark Tuesday about what was happening inPanama, with no details about the coup's chances of success. Therewere suggestions, though, that a clear effort to restore democracymight have brought U.S. help to the rebels.   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said the rebels hadNoriega in custody for four to five hours but then let him go, anaccount substantially confirmed by Noriega aides in Panama.   ``It's crazy, I don't understand it,'' an official said whenasked why the insurgents decided to free Noriega.   Bush was buffeted by words from Congress, where one seniorRepublican said, ``We blew it,'' and a Democratic colleague spokescornfully of ``cold feet.''   In the Senate, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., proposed an amendment to ananti-drug bill to authorize Bush to use U.S. troops to forcefullyremove Noriega from power and bring him to trial in the UnitedStates on the drug charges already pending against him. The movewas seen as symbolic, since Bush already has such powers.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, testifying before aSenate committee, indicated the United States had kept its distanceTuesday because the rebels had little possibility of removingNoriega. Brushing aside criticism of the U.S. reaction, Baker said,``It's easy to be an armchair general.''   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the SenateFinance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable. ...You don't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and inresponse to rapidly changing circumstances.''   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters on Capitol Hillthat it was not clear at the time that Noriega was being held, butthe Bush administration now believes that was the case.   ``Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us,''Cheney said.   Cheney said, ``It was not a pro-democracy group that had takenover the PDF. It was more of a power struggle within the PDFitself.''   Cheney said there was even some doubt whether the coup attempthad been staged by Noriega.   ``The individual who was reputed to be in charge of the coup wasa man who was a noted confidante of Mr. Noriega, and most peoplelooking at that set of facts, who the individual was who wasinvolved, would conclude that it was very possible that this was asetup by Noriega,'' Cheney said in an interview with CBS News.   In that same interview, Cheney also said the United States hasgiven refuge to the family of one of the individuals involved inthe coup attempt.   Quoting an unidentified member of Congress who attended abriefing by Cheney, The New York Times said in Thursday editionsthat Cheney reported the U.S. military in Panama had givensanctuary to several officers who took part in the uprising.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the UnitedStates had been tipped off about a coup attempt during the weekendby ``a third party'' and was in touch with ``relatively low-level''members of the rebel force during the fighting.   One administration official said the United States would havebeen happy to step in with force if it had been requested.   ``The (U.S.) people down there were under instructions to lookfor an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up,'' said theofficial, insisting on anonymity. ``As I understand, if they wereasked for assistance to support a pro-democracy movement they wouldhave done it.''   Fitzwater said ``just about everything'' about the coup arguedagainst U.S. military involvement, especially lack of reliableinformation.   Asked if the United States might have helped the rebels if theyhad agreed to turn over Noriega, Fitzwater said, ``I don't know. Ican just tell you the way it unfolded.''   Fitzwater said the person who alerted the United States to theplanned coup ``told us with an idea of seeing how we would react toit. And basically, our reaction was that we would protect property,treaty rights and people, but that was it.''   Baker and Fitzwater refused to confirm reports that the UnitedStates had given refuge to coup leaders and their families inPanama.   Noriega blamed the uprising on the United States, saying, ``Theproof is that American troops closed access routes to the barracks,just as they closed the Pan-American Highway.''   Fitzwater said Wednesday, ``We did move forces in a position tosecure the causeway and the bridge of the Americas as a means ofprotecting U.S. citizens who were on the base. Those are the majoraccess routes to our base.''   The U.S. Southern Command's headquarters is about one-half milefrom the main Panamanian Defense Forces barracks where the violentcoup attempt occurred.   The failed attempt was a major setback for the United States'long campaign to oust Noriega from power.   The administration said there were two ways of interpreting theresults. One was that Noriega had strengthened his hand byovercoming the coup. Another reading was that it had demonstratedopposition to Noriega's leadershipas well as divisions withinPanama's military forces.   Embracing the second interpretation, Fitzwater said, ``That maybe a good omen for the long term.''   Few in Congress were putting it that way.   ``It's a major setback for our foreign policy,'' said Rep.William Broomfield of Michigan, senior Republican on the HouseForeign Relations Committee. ``It raises questions whether peopledown there can ever have confidence in the United States.''   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., likened the situation to the failedattempt by exiled Cubans to invade at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, whenU.S. support evaporated at the crucial moment.   ``We had full knowledge they were going to do this. I'm afraidit's a matter of cold feet,'' Skelton said. ``It was a consciousdecision (by Bush) not to assist... I'm furious about it.'' He saidhe had gotten his information about a White House decision from asenior Pentagon official.   There were some dissenting voices.   ``The president was absolutely correct,'' said Rep. JosephMcDade, R-Pa. ``We're not an invading force. We'd like to seeGeneral Noriega out, but I support the president in what he did.''   Andrew H. Card Jr., a senior adviser to Bush and deputy to WhiteHouse chief of staff John Sununu, told reporters the White Houseposition was that Panama's military forces should do everythingthey could against Noriega before there was any outsideintervention.   ``We were not invited to participate,'' Card said. ``We did notoffer to participate.''</TEXT></DOC>
