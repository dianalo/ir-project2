The new law, passed by Parliament on Tuesday, was approved bythe Council of Guardians. It gives the Iranian government the rightto arrest Americans who act against its interests anywhere in theworld and bring them to the Islamic Republic for trial by Islamiccourts.   The Parliament members who introduced the measure said itmirrors a similar power the U.S. government granted itself to bringterrorists to the United States for trial.   ``You who scream about human rights and talk about terrorism,are yourselves innately terrorists and criminals who have takensecurity away from the people of the world,'' parliament speakerMahdi Karrubi said on a Tehran radio broadcast monitored in Nicosia.   The new law precedes celebrations Saturday marking the 10thanniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran byIranian militants.   As part of the celebrations, protesters will burn 160 flagsbefore the sprawling compound of the former embassy in downtownTehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.   The 160 flags will honor 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems beheaded inSaudi Arabia for planting bombs in Mecca during the annual Moslempilgrimage earlier this year that killed one pilgrim and wounded 16others.   Iran has rebutted televised confessions by those convicted thatTehran trained them and supplied the explosives for their mission.The Iranians have turned the beheadings into a cause celebre,denouncing it as a ``U.S. plot.''   An Iranian newspaper suggested that the former captain of theAmerican warship Vincennes be the first person brought to trial inIran under the new anti-American law.   The radical daily, Abrar, said Capt. Will Rogers II, commanderof the Navy warship when it shot down an Iran Air passenger jetover the Persian Gulf, could be brought to trial in Iran under themeasure.   The Vincennes shot down the plane during fighting in the gulf inJuly 1988, killing all 290 people on board. The Navy said the crewmistook the ascending passenger plane for an attacking F-14 fighterjet.   The new law empowers the Iranian president to take all``necessary steps for capture and prosecution of Americans, as wellas their direct and indirect elements who have been prosecuted inIranian courts,'' the radio said.   It added that citizens of countries which cooperate directly orindirectly with America in abducting Iranian citizens, or conspireagainst their lives or property of the Islamic Republic, will betried in Iranian courts according to Islamic principles.</TEXT></DOC>
