He remarkedthat he was &quot;within two days&quot; of taking a position at a WestCoast biotech concern when the Du Pont-Merck offer beckoned.He has been a consultant to Genentech since resigning fromhis executive post at the South San Francisco, Calif.,company last November.   Dr. Martin said the Du Pont-Merck venture attracted himwith the breadth of its technology and what he called thecommitment of the venture partners to long-term goals.&quot;They're careful in picking what they want to do, but theydon't change direction,&quot; he said.   The joint venture, announced in July, is a recent exampleof the spate of cooperative ventures and mergers to crop upamong drug companies as they cope with growing research anddevelopment costs and global competition. Du Pont, thediversified chemicals concern based in Wilmington, Del., isputting all its drug business into the venture. Merck, ofRahway, N.J., is contributing rights to market some of itsdrugs and an undisclosed amount of cash.   Merck, often called the premier drug research company inits industry, is using the venture to tap the new-drugpipeline at Du Pont. For Du Pont, the venture offers a quickway to expand its presence abroad, through rights to certainMerck products in Europe.   A Du Pont spokesman confirmed Dr. Martin's appointment butdeclined to say whether the new company is looking outside tofill other top positions.   A final agreement on the joint venture hasn't yet beenreached, but Joseph A. Mollica, currently a Du Pont vicepresident, already has been named chief executive officer ofthe new company. Dr. Martin will report to Mr. Mollica andassume some of the research management tasks that Mr.Mollica, a scientist by training, has had within Du Pont.   At Genentech, Dr. Martin presided over a research programthat has produced some of the early fruits of biotechnology,such as genetically engineered human growth hormone, soldunder the trade name Protropin, and the heart drug known asTPA or Activase. But at the Du Pont-Merck venture, he will bemanaging a far larger staff, about 1,500 instead of the 700at Genentech.   A spokeswoman for Merck said that officials who would befamiliar with appointments at the new company weren'tavailable for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
