It remains to be seen now whetherCongress will manage to kill it.   Last week, the Senate Energy Committee approved the Bushblueprint for a National Energy Strategy by a remarkable17-to-3 vote with only minor changes. The Bush programlargely relies on market forces and American ingenuity toprovide the energy a growing economy needs. It makes a fewsymbolic bows to industrial-policy programs such as ethanolboondoggles and the like, but the strategy, like the Membersof the Senate's Energy Committee, appears to have acceptedhistory's lesson that markets have built-in incentives forefficiency and conservation.</LP><TEXT>   The rest of the Senate and the House, however, will be atougher sell. Some parts of the Bush bill, such asderegulating natural-gas pipelines and researchinghigh-efficiency engines, aren't controversial. But in threekey areas -- nuclear power, auto mileage standards and oilprospecting -- expect a knockdown, drag-out fight.   Streamlining the licensing of new nuclear plants. Not asingle nuclear plant has been built for more than a decade;the hysteria whipped up over the Three Mile Island accidentin 1979 saw to that. Today a new and much safer generation ofnuclear reactors is now ready, but no nuclear plants, nomatter how safe, can be built under current licensing rules.A process of endless public hearings exists simply to stopconstruction. The Seabrook, N.H., plant was delayed for threeyears, at a cost to the utility and ratepayers of over $1billion. President Bush wants to allow a &quot;one-stop&quot; licensingsystem that combines the current sets of hearings into one,while still allowing full public comment.   No artificial increase in CAFE fuel-economy standards. Inthe 1970s, Congress imposed auto fleet-mileage standards,called CAFE, on U.S. car companies in response to the &quot;energycrisis.&quot; Since then, CAFE has saved a little energy atenormous cost, surrendered much of the domestic luxury-carmarket to foreigners and forced Americans to drive smaller,more vulnerable safe cars. But austerity-worshipers, withNevada Senator Richard Bryan as their vehicle, want to orderup a new average mileage standard of 40 miles per gallon fromthe current 27.5. And they aren't much inclined to wait for aNational Academy of Sciences study on what standards arecost-effective or even technologically feasible.   The Department of Transportation estimates that thesmaller cars mandated by the Bryan bill would increase annualhighway fatalities by between 600 and 1,140. Harvardpublic-health professor John Graham says the Bryan bill wouldmore than wipe out the safety benefits gained from installingair bags.   Allowing oil exploration and drilling in a portion ofAlaska's coast. A 20-by-100 mile stretch of Alaska's harshnorthern coast may contain the last major oil deposit inNorth America. The Interior Department says there's a 46%chance of finding recoverable amounts of oil and a decentchance the find could rival the nearby Prudhoe Bay field,which provides 25% of the U.S. domestic oil supply.   Environmentalists bitterly oppose any intrusion into theMaine-sized Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 92% of which isoff-limits to any exploration. But in 1980 Congress agreedthat the remainder could be developed with little or no riskto the environment. However, some Members want to lock it up.   To Senator Max Baucus of Montana it is &quot;one of the fivegreatest places on earth.&quot; But ANWR's coastal plain is noYellowstone. The area is a barren, marshy wilderness in thesummer and a frozen desert the rest of the year. Only about150 naturalists or outdoorsmen visit it in a given year. Theexperience of the nearby Prudhoe Bay field indicates thatdeveloping ANWR would affect only about 13,000 acres out of1.5 million, an minute percentage of the whole. All equipmentwould be carefully removed and the ground reseeded after theextraction of any oil. Environmentalists won't even discussthe issue. &quot;There can be no compromise,&quot; says Allen Smith ofthe Wilderness Society. &quot;The refuge must not be violated, orit will be destroyed.&quot;   This sort of environmental absolutism upsets Brenda IttaLee, an Inupiat Eskimo official from Alaska's North Slope.&quot;Since it's our home, we care about the area even more thanothers,&quot; she says. &quot;But oil revenue has meant a better lifefor us. If ANWR is locked up, my people lose a lot. A balancecan be struck.&quot;   Finding a balance between legitimate environmentalconcerns and the real-life needs of people is at the heart ofPresident Bush's energy program. Its opponents have forgottenthat human beings must also be an integral part of theenvironmental equation.</TEXT></DOC>
