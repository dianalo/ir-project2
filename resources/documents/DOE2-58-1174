From the recorded spectral patterns,the energies and oscillator strengths of the bands were measured. Tocorrelate the measured intensities with the theoretical data the followingtwo methods have been adopted. They are (i) Judd-Ofelt theory, and (ii)Electric dipole linestrength values. The significant environmental influenceon the features of the bands of the ions was realised. The relationshipbetween the Judd-Ofelt parameter T/sub 2/ and the hypersensitive transitionsintensity for holmium and samarium has also been verified. The necessaryspectroscopy parameters needed for understanding the spectral featuresof the two rare-earth ions in five alcohols are reported in this briefpaper.
