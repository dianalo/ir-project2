KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House voted 393-7 on Tuesday to place itssymbolic stamp of approval on the new treaty banning medium-rangenuclear weapons worldwide.   The action has no practical effect since the Senate hasexclusive rights to consent to the ratification of treaties.   But it does put the House on record as overwhelmingly endorsingthe Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty shortly before theSenate opens debate on the agreement.   The resolution voicing support of the treaty, which wasconcluded by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev in Washington last December, also made a series ofnon-binding policy statements in which the House:   _Declared that the president should continue to provide acredible nuclear deterrent force, including maintaining nuclearweapons in Europe to help ensure the security of the NATO alliance.   _Called on the president to provide leadership to strengthenNATO's conventional forces and modernize the alliance's nucleardeterrent forces in Europe.   _Urged the administration to seek verifiable conventional armsagreements resulting in Warsaw Pact arms reductions in those areaswhere pact forces have superior strength.   _Called for the creation of a comprehensive arms controlstrategy.   _Endorsed the Reagan administration's effort to negotiate withthe Soviet Union effectively verifiable reductions in strategic,intercontinental nuclear forces.   _Declared the president should act appropriately to deal withany Soviet violations of the new INF treaty, including withdrawingfrom it if the violations are serious.   _Called on the president to propose ways of resolving existingalleged Soviet arms control violations ``and to address any futureSoviet arms control violations in a decisive manner.''   The INF treaty requires the destruction of all U.S. and Sovietmissiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. It bansflight tests of any missiles within that range. And it provides foron-site inspection to verify compliance. Most such weapons aredeployed in Europe but the treaty imposes a worldwide ban.   The House resolution stated that the treaty sets an importantprecedent by requiring the Soviets to destroy more weapons than theUnited States in order to eliminate all such medium-range missiles.   It applauded verification requirements as being ``extremelystringent.''   ``The INF Treaty vindicates the importance of NATO securitycooperation and illustrates the ability of the members in NATO toact in concert to accomplish meaningful reductions in Sovietnuclear arms,'' the resolution declared.   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., one of the few House members to speakagainst the treaty, said it should be rejected because the Sovietscan cover European targets with long-range weapons, and because, hecontended, Moscow is certain to cheat.   ``The Soviet Union sucks us into agreements and later violatesthem,'' Burton asserted. ``This is another tragic mistake.''</TEXT></DOC>
