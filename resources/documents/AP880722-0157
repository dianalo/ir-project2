U.S. District Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. ordered thejury, which would have been dissolved on July 28, to continue itswork through Jan. 27, 1989. That would extend its original 18-monthauthority into the term of the next president.   Robinson's order referred to a sealed request from independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh and authorized the jury to deal with``investigations identified by the government in its motion.''   Walsh has been looking into an illegal operation to organize aprivate arms supply network for the Contras fighting the Sandinistagovernment of Nicaragua at a time when U.S. aid was banned byCongress.   The grand jury a month ago indicted the CIA's former stationchief in Costa Rica, Joseph F. Fernandez, on five counts oforganizing the network. The charges also included unidentifiedco-conspirators.   Walsh has been continuing his investigation while preparing forthe trials of former White House aide Oliver L. North, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and Richard V. Secord for their roles in the sale ofarms to Iran and the alleged diversion of funds to the Nicaraguanrebels.   Walsh's spokesman, Jim Wieghart, said he could not comment onthe investigation. Specifics of the request for extension could notbe made public, he said.   On Tuesday, North, Poindexter and Hakim petitioned the U.S.Court of Appeals to have their indictments dismissed because theybelieve testimony they gave to Congress under immunity would beused against them in the trials.   Attorneys for North, who is to be tried first, have appealed fora delay of his trial from its scheduled start on Sept. 20 untilMarch 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
