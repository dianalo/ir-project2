Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, has spent five birthdays in captivity since gunmen seizedhim on a Beirut street on March 16, 1985.   But his sister, Peggy Say, said that ceremonies of the kind heldtoday at Georgetown University's Dahlgren Chapel have made sure hehas not been forgotten.   Hope, she said, is the way that she and other families of eightAmerican hostages in Lebanon have survived their ordeal. ``Hope isnot a way out, it is a way through,'' she said.   After years of crushed expectations and false alarms, Mrs. Saysaid, she still prays every day and night that freedom will come tohere brother.   ``It is my hope that our hostages will not have suffered for solong for nothing,'' she said, appealing for peace in the MiddleEast.   Prominent journalists, along with representatives of the StateDepartment and the embassies of Lebanon, Algeria and Syria attendedthe hour-long mass in the small chapel. Among those attending wereWalter R. Mears, an AP vice president, and Jonathan P. Wolman, AP'sWashington bureau chief.   The celebrants prayed, listened to psalms and received Communionat a Mass officiated by the Rev. Lawrence Madden.   Charles Lewis, Washington bureau chief for Hearst Newspapers,said other hostages who were in captivity with Anderson recalledhow important his Roman Catholic faith has been to him whilepassing the time frequently in a darkened room. Anderson even madea rosary from fibers in a mat that he sat on, Lewis said.   Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchorman, implored the Shiite Muslimswho hold Anderson captive to release him. ``No God would sanctionsuch an act,'' he said, urging the kidnappers to ``reclaim yourplace in society.''   Brokaw said American journalists are among the freest people ina free society, and all reporters are captive until Anderson isreleased.   Describing Anderson's captivity as ``a special cruelty for ajournalist,'' Brokaw said, ``As long as he is a hostage, we are notfree.''   Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post,said all journalists feel an outrage at Anderson's captivity, andit is way past time the cruel treatment of him and the otherhostages ends.   Others who took part in the service were former diplomat BruceLaingen, once a hostage in Iran; and journalists Peter S. Prichard,editor of USA Today; Peter Arnett, a CNN correspondent; R.W. Apple,deputy Washington editor of The New York Times; and David Aikman, aforeign correspondent for Time magazine.   A number of relatives of other hostages also attended, includingthe family members of Americans Frank Reed, Joseph Cicippio, AlannSteen and Robert Pohill and Alec Collett, an Englishman.</TEXT></DOC>
