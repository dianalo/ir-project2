In the case, which has gained widespread national attention, aman who donated his sperm to a woman in a lesbian relationshipsought the right to periodically meet the 15-month-old daughter bornas a result of the artificial insemination.   The donor claimed that an ``emotional attachment'' to the childdeveloped over visits to the lesbian couple before and after thebirth.   A month ago, the Utrecht court ruled that the father was entitled``in principle'' to sue for his rights. But Dutch family law doesnot contain specific provisions outlining the rights of sperm donors.   The identities of both the plaintiff and the defendants in thelawsuit were not disclosed for reasons of privacy, and courthearings six weeks ago took place behind closed doors.   In its ruling Thursday, the court said that ``in this particularcase, the tensions caused by periodical visits would be veryserious, and that is not in the interest of the child.''   The ruling also said that ``in cases such as this, visitationrights should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.'' Itdid not elaborate.   During the hearings, the lesbian couple claimed that thefriendship with the donor had ended and that serious personalconflicts had developed, according to their lawyer, Arnoud Willems.   He added that the couple had rejected the idea of an anonymousdonor so that the father could be identified if the child laterwould ask for his name.   Artificial insemination by donated sperm is a widespread practicein the Netherlands, but the strict confidentiality that preventsidentification of the parties involved usually precludes such legalbattles.</TEXT></DOC>
