We consider all sources of anisotropy,i.e., anisotropic phonon dispersion curves and anisotropic Fermi surface,to determine the electron-phonon spectral functions {alpha}/sub k/{sup2} (omega) F/sub k/(omega) and the matrix elements of the screened Coulombrepulsion. We find values of the gap anisotropy parameter andless;a{sup 2}andgt;and of the ratio between the pure single-crystal and isotropic dirtylimit critical temperatures that agree better with experimental resultsthan the values found using a constant {mu}. Disagreement between theoryand experiment remains for the variation of {Delta}{sub 0}(k) itselfover the Fermi surface.</TEXT></DOC>
