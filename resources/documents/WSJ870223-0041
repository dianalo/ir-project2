Alaska reported an unaudited $16.2 million fourth-quarter loss, and disclosed that its main bank unit is seeking financial assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    The Anchorage-based company's United Bank Alaska unit has been wracked by real estate losses related to Alaska's severe energy industry slump. The fourth-quarter loss reduced the holding company's shareholder equity to $12.6 million at year's end, or 2.6% of its $482 million of assets. Federal regulators generally ask for banks to maintain equity levels of at least 4% to 5%.    United Bancorp. Alaska is the second Alaska bank holding company this month to ask the government for help. Two weeks ago, Anchorage-based Alaska Mutual Bancorp. applied for federal assistance after its shareholder equity fell to just 1.7% of assets.    United Bancorp. Alaska said it is seeking so-called open-bank assistance from the FDIC, under which the agency infuses capital but refrains from declaring the institution insolvent. The FDIC provides such assistance when it determines the method is less expensive than closing a failed bank. For example, the FDIC, which declines to comment on open-bank assistance applications, provided billions of dollars in loans and capital to keep the Continental Illinois Corp. afloat in 1984.    The company also said that for 1986, it had an unaudited loss of $25.8 million, against earnings of $2 million, or 52 cents a share, in 1985.    The company said its fourth-quarter results included a $9.9 million provision for loan losses, bringing its total loan-loss provision for the year to $14.4 million. The bank's total allowance for loan losses at year's end was $10.4 million.    United Bancorp. Alaska said it believes government assistance is necessary to help its bank units cover the high carrying costs on their large volume of nonperforming loans. These costs include the lack of interest income on the assets, the direct holding costs on the properties and future declines in the properties' market values. The company said there is &quot;virtually no current market&quot; for real estate in Alaska now, and it sees &quot;no prognosis for a rapid turnaround.&quot;    United Bank Alaska is currently operating under an agreement with regulators in which it has promised to increase capital by $6 million and maintain a ratio of capital to assets of 7.5%. Last fall, the bank determined that it could achieve these goals by merging its two subsidiaries and infusing an additional $7.5 million of capital into the merged bank. But the company said it has failed to raise the necessary capital, forcing it to withdraw the offering and cancel the merger plans. </TEXT></DOC>
