(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Game officials Friday began selectingapplicants for this fall's alligator hunt, the first in more than25 years as the reptile has battled its way off theendangered-species list.   Some 5,800 people applied for roughly 230 permits that areexpected to be issued, said Scott Ball of the Game and Fresh WaterFish Commission.   Commission officials were sorting through applications Fridayand preparing them for a random, computer selection process. MikeJennings, a wildlife biologist for the game commission, said thefinal list would be completed early next week.   Applicants, who must be at least 18, include men and women fromacross the state and a few out-of-state residents. Floridaresidents will pay $250 for a license, while those from otherstates will have to pay $1,000.   Those who are chosen must complete a six-hour course inalligator basics and hunting safety before the 30-day hunt beginsSept. 1. It will be the first authorized season since 1962.Twenty-eight lakes, rivers and streams have been chosen as huntingsites.   Florida's once-endangered gator population now numbers anestimated 1 million in the wild. Each hunter will be allowed tokill up to 15 gators, bringing the potential total kill to morethan 3,400.   Under the rules of the hunt, alligators can be trapped orharpooned. They can't be shot outright, but hunters will be allowedto use guns to finish them off if they are still alive after beingspeared and dragged to the bank.   Though there hasn't been an alligator hunting season for aquarter-century, Florida has licensed hunters to rid the state ofrenegade gators that lose their natural fear of humans and threatenthe state's burgeoning population. They kill about 3,500 alligatorsa year, selling parts for profit.   Some of those professional hunters have criticized the plans forthe hunting season, saying that amateurs could get hurt and thatall the meat and hide they bring in could reduce prices.   ``When you quit having respect for a gator, that's when you gethurt,'' said one trapper, William Whidden of Osteen. ``I respectone if he ain't but 2 foot long, because I know what he can do tomy hand.''   Dennis David, alligator coordinator for the game commission,dismissed the scare claims of trappers and alligator growers.   ``There are plenty of the nuisance alligator trappers that havebeen doing it for years that are missing fingers or have beeninjured,'' said David.</TEXT></DOC>
