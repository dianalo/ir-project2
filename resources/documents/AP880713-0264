Some industry analysts believe Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates have decided privately that cheap oil is oneof their most effective and plentiful weapons to achieve theseaims, despite the enormous revenue losses they could endure.   Together, these oil-rich Persian Gulf members of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries represent astaggering force that could easily inundate the fragile worldenergy markets with millions of excess barrels.   For Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and mostpowerful OPEC member, driving prices down could help achieve themultiple aim of seizing a greater market share and bankruptingMoslem-world adversary Iran, which relies heavily on oil sales tofinance its protracted Persian Gulf war against Iraq.   ``The Saudis are simply determined to basically starve the moneyflowing into the region as a means of ending the war,'' saidStephen Smith, a petroleum analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. in NewYork. ``The Saudis have deeper pockets than Iran. They're justgetting awfully tired of the risks in the region.''   Moreover, some analysts reason, the Saudis and their Arab allieswant George Bush to inherit the U.S. presidency from Ronald Reagan,because of the Republican-led commitment to protect Persian Gulfshipping, as well as fear that a Democratic administration wouldreverse that policy.   By depressing oil prices, they can artificially restrainAmerican inflation and trade deficit figures, helping preserveRepublican claims of a healthy U.S. economy and blunting Democraticcriticism.   For example, a 10 percent decline in crude oil prices means a 1percent drop in the U.S. inflation rate, according to some economicreckonings. Crude prices already have fallen nearly 22 percent inthe last two months, which could substantially reduce thegovernment's pre-election inflation figures.   Perhaps more important, cheap oil can shave the market-joltingmonthly merchandise trade figures that have become such apolitically sensitive issue for the Republicans.   With the United States importing 7 million barrels of oil a dayat prices of between $14 and $15 a barrel, that represents amonthly bill of between $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion. If crudeprices fall to a two-year low of $10 a barrel, as some analystspredict, the savings would be considerable.   While some market strategists say this argument is far-fetched,others say it is increasingly mentioned as a possible reason forthe most recent declines in prices, well below OPEC's target priceof $18.   ``Political analysts have told me it is a potentially motivatingfactor,'' said Morris Greenberg, an energy expert at the WefaGroup, a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Apparently, theleadership in those countries would find it in their interest tohave continuity in the political situation here.''   For one thing, Greenberg said, Gulf Arab regimes favor stabilityin general. Secondly, he said, ``they look upon a newadministration as taking a certain amount of time to get up tospeed on the issues. Clearly, Bush has far more experience.''   Still, some say the main reason that the Saudis and their allieswant to depress prices is economic. Cheaper oil discouragesexploration by non-OPEC producers and gives the cartel greaterpower to raise prices in the future.   ``To maintain solidarity and cohesiveness in OPEC, they have tomove toward that $18 number,'' said Sanford Margoshes, oil analystat Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``So I would say in terms ofpriorities, the rumor that they are keeping prices down to electBush is interesting but far down on the list.''   Others said Saudi strategy probably has nothing to do with U.S.politics. They believe oil prices will rise rapidly once Iran isdriven by economic desperation to make peace, as some predict itwill do by year-end.   ``I think the Saudis now feel they have Iran on the ropes,''said George Gaspar, oil analyst at the Milwaukee investment firm ofRobert W. Baird andamp; Co. ``After a cease-fire and negotiations, theSaudi position will shift. They'll be looking for higher prices toaccommodate Iran and other OPEC countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
