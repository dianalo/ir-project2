The positioningof the detectors turned out to be satisfactory in 83% of the patientswhen compared with the determination of the split function at scintigraphy.This might be explained by the small 100% isocount area of the probe(avoiding the effect of mobile kidneys) and by the 4-channel localizationsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
