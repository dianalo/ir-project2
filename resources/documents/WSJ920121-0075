Mr. Brown now claims that &quot;the world's grain reserves areprojected to sink to their lowest levels since 1976 -- enoughto last only 68 days.&quot; But in 1988, Mr. Brown was crying wolfover a global grain supply that he then alleged had fallen tojust &quot;54 days of consumption.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, Mr. Brown has made similar claims of scarce grainsupplies in almost every year of the past quarter-century. In1974, for instance, he claimed grain supplies were thenequivalent to only &quot;27 days of consumption.&quot; In 1976, healleged that global grain supplies for that year amounted to&quot;31 days,&quot; while in 1980 the figure was &quot;40 days.&quot;Subsequently, while never admitting error, Mr. Brownpublished data indicating that the 1974 figure was actually&quot;61 days,&quot; and the 1976 and 1980 figures were 79 and 71&quot;days,&quot; respectively.   Although Mr. Brown now professes concern over an alleged&quot;68 days&quot; grain supply leading to &quot;an extremely volatileprice situation,&quot; he has long held that the &quot;danger point&quot;below which the world's supplies should not fall was 50 &quot;daysof consumption.&quot; That level, he said, ensured adequate foodsupplies and price stability. In 1985, e.g., he noted that1984's &quot;level of grain and cropland reserves equaled 56 daysof world food consumption, more than enough to maintainrelatively stable prices in world grain markets.&quot;   Mr. Brown recently switched to a new, higher &quot;dangerlevel&quot; for his &quot;days of consumption&quot; figure in order tosupport his scarcity claims in the face of adequate, if notoutright burdensome, grain reserves. Incidentally, the U.S.Agriculture Department does not sanction Mr. Brown's methodsnor use his &quot;days of consumption&quot; ploy. Indeed, every USDAreport cautions that the grain supply data &quot;should not beconstrued as representing world stock levels at a fixed pointin time,&quot; as Mr. Brown continually does.   Meanwhile, this nation's winter-wheat crop, some 80% ofthe year's total production, lies dormant in the ground withideal weather and soil moisture. An article in theCommodities Corner of Barron's took note of this situationand predicted a &quot;coming blizzard in wheat&quot; at next spring'sharvest.   If that proves true, one wonders what new stratagem Mr.Brown will employ so that he may continue to cry wolf.   James A.
