Inthis Chapter the authors discuss how the experience for miners is usedto estimate the incidence of radon-induced lung cancer among the generalpopulation. Such estimates cannot be very precise, in part because theminers studies do not lead to a well-determined relationship betweenthe rate of cancer induction and the exposure levels. In particular,there are disparities in the results of studies for different groupsof miners. These disparities may arise from the difficulties in obtainingaccurate crucial data, such as the year-by-year exposure history overthe working lifetime of the individual miners. Other differences mayarise from differences in the smoking patterns in different groups andin details of the handling of the data. In any event, there remain substantialuncertainties in the conclusions for the miners themselves, both as tothe &quot;average&quot; rate of cancer induction per WLM and as to the variationof this rate with the magnitude of the total exposure. Further, thereare problems in using results obtained for miners at relatively highradon exposure levels for the prediction of the effects of radon at themuch lower levels encountered in the normal indoor environment. Hereone faces the problem of extrapolating from large dose levels to smalldose levels. The generally adopted solution is to assume linearity.</TEXT></DOC>
