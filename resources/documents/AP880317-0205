Reporters on the scene confirmed the raid, which came the dayafter Honduras accused the Nicaraguans of sending thousands ofsoldiers across the border in pursuit of U.S.-supported Contrarebels.   A Reagan administration source in Washington said the Honduranair force had carried out the attack. However, a Honduran armedforces spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the capital, denied the armedforces had crossed into Nicaragua and said rockets were fired atSandinista forces in Honduran territory.   More than 3,000 American soldiers began arriving in Honduras ina show of support Thursday. Ortega declared his army ready to``combat and liquidate'' the Americans and said his soldiers willnot withdraw from the border region.   Nicaragua has committed an estimated 6,000 soldiers to ananti-rebel operation in an area running from the central region tothe border, with most of them at the frontier.   Manuel Espinoza Enriquez, spokesman for Ortega, said the attackon Bocay, near the border, caused no injuries or damage. He saidNicaraguan soldiers fired on the planes, forcing them to turn back.   At least five rockets were fired at the headquarters, he said,but did not say whether any hit the target.   The U.S. official in Washington said two U.S.-built F-5s andfour Super-Mystere attack jets of the Honduran air force carriedout the assault, destroying one of Nicaragua's Soviet-madehelicopters on the ground.   ``This was totally a Honduran operation,'' the official said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Honduras has one of Central America's smallest armies and relieson air superiority for defense. It and Mexico are the only nationsin the region with jet fighters.   Manuel Suarez, the Honduran armed forces spokesman, said in atelephone interview that the air force dropped at least five bombsinside Honduras along the border region near Bocay. He said he hadno further information.   Ortega called the dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras ``one moreescalation of the war against Nicaragua'' and demanded a meeting ofthe U.N. Security Council.   A council meeting Thursday about British military maneuvers inthe Falkland Islands became an impromptu debate of the U.S. action,with barbs exchanged by Nicaragua and Panama on one side and theUnited States on the other.   In Managua, Ortega said: ``We logically are going to maintainour offensive. ... We are not going to withdraw our troops now thatwe have recovered our territory.   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the82nd Airborne Division.''   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already hadbegun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don'tplan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalationhas already begun,'' the spokesman, Alejandro Bendana, said onNBC's ``Today'' show.   Ortega spoke to reporters before meeting with 14 oppositionparties ``to explain to them the national and internationalsituation.''   The 3,200 U.S. soldiers who began arriving in Honduras onThursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at FortBragg, N.C.   Ortega accused the United States of pressuring Honduras intoasking for the American presence.   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles westof the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinistatroops entered Honduras, and he invited the United Nations andOrganization of American States to visit the area to ``establishwhat the facts are and end these accusations.''   Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinista troops crossed theborder.   ``Here the question is not if (Nicaraguan) army troopspenetrated Honduran tserritory or not, but that we have dozens ofcamps of mercenary forces in Honduran territory, in view of andtolerated by the Honduran government,'' he said.   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surroundingabout 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said theentire Honduran military was on alert.   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists inthe warped imagination of the North American leaders.''   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops fromHonduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting thatis going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' hesaid.   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to beginthree days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southernNicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation togive the Contras logistical and military aid not approved byCongress.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuella called forrestraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in anobserver team.</TEXT></DOC>
