In Los Angeles, TRW Corp. managers divide up and recombine contract bids. In a Washington, D.C., hospital, computers make sure that doctors and nurses have read patient records.    All these people are working on personal computers that communicate via a new type of software called &quot;groupware.&quot;    After years of celebrating individualism, software makers are trying to turn personal computers from islands of information into work-group tools. &quot;Most personal computers generate one piece of paper,&quot; says Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. &quot;Groupware shuffles the paper.&quot;    Underscoring the growing interest in groupware, Lotus Development Corp. will announce today at the Personal Computer Forum industry conference in Naples, Fla., that it is developing a groupware program called Notes. The program is designed to let people using personal computers on a network plan meetings, share comments, track projects and examine libraries of documents.    Lotus also is developing a complement to text-based Notes: a data-base manager designed to organize number-based information for people in work groups.    These two programs are among an anticipated flood of new groupware products that will be more varied and easier to use than the few programs now in the category. Industry consultants predict groupware will flourish because personal-computer software that helps individuals work better hasn't noticeably increased the productivity of groups.    &quot;There's an incredible set of capabilities that will be unleashed once people understand how to work together across networks,&quot; says Patricia Seybold, president of Office Computing Group, a Boston consulting firm.    Groupware takes advantage of the networks that connect groups of personal computers to each other and to printers and disks. Now, workers use the networks mostly for sending one another electronic mail. Consultants say groupware will push personal computers -- cheaper and easier to use than minicomputers -- into areas of office automation long dominated by minis, like document handling and tracking.    One current groupware program -- Staffware, from FCMC Inc., Berkeley, Calif. -- passes tasks from person to person, assuring that everyone involved does his piece of the job. The company says personnel at one Air Force base use it to track certain orders, making sure authorization is received from each required officer.    Another groupware product, called Docuforum, from NETI Technologies Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, keeps track of who inserts each part of a document. NETI says some companies use it to produce annual reports, circulating proposed sections among lawyers, accountants and marketers.    Lotus, the No. 2 personal-computer software company, says Notes won't be available for about a year. That's partly because the program is designed to work with an operating system for International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computers called Presentation Manager, due out in October. Lotus says it hasn't set a price for Notes.    In the meantime, some 200 employees in several different buildings at Lotus's Cambridge, Mass., headquarters are using Notes experimentally. One use lets Lotus track discussions of potential product or corporate acquisitions by various executives and its corporate-strategy group.    When a company approaches a Lotus executive with a proposal, details are recorded on an electronic form that can be called up from a central data base by authorized employees. Subsequently, as other executives review the proposal and make recommendations, they update the form, leaving an electronic &quot;paper trail.&quot; Michael Kolowich, vice president for graphics, text and information management, says the system assures that such proposals don't &quot;fall through the cracks.&quot;    Notes can boost group productivity by letting people avoid or shorten meetings. Eric S. Sall, Lotus's product director, says that when his group plans weekly meetings, everyone suggests items for the agenda, which is then available in Notes to be read. Many items are resolved before the meetings, he says.    Lotus uses icons to symbolize various categories, making it easier for Notes users to find information. In the system being used at Lotus, a drawing of an insect symbolizes the category &quot;software problem reports&quot; -- bugs, in industry parlance. </TEXT></DOC>
