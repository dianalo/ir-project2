The justices, by a 7-1 vote, ruled that the federal law enactedto discourage tax evasion in the trading of municipal bonds doesnot violate any state's sovereign immunity.   In other cases, the court also ruled that:   _Unions may distribute handbills urging consumers to boycott``neutral employers'' against whom the unions have no grievance.   _The government may disqualify military veterans who arealcoholics from receiving benefits by viewing their condition as``willful misconduct'' rather than an uncontrollable disease.   South Carolina had challenged the municipal bond registrationlaw, arguing that it will hurt state and local governments byforcing them to chose between two costly alternatives: Continue toissue unregistered bonds for which investors will have theirinterest taxed or pay sizeable registration fees.   State and local governments issue bonds to finance variousprojects such as building roads and schools.   More than half the states had supported South Carolina'schallenge.   The law, which took effect July 1, 1983, is aimed in part atdiscouraging tax evasion when bonds change hands as gifts or arepassed on to an heir. While the interest on government bonds isexempt from federal income tax, the bonds are taxed as gifts or aspart of an estate.   In passing the law, Congress mainly intended to crack down onthe use of such bonds as an untraceable substitute for cash inillegal activities, and to make it easier to catch criminals whodeal in stolen or forged securities.   Writing for the court today, Justice William J. Brennan said,``A nondiscriminatory federal tax on the interest earned on statebonds does not violate the intergovernmental tax immunitydoctrine.''   Only Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, accusing the courtof overturning ``a precedent that it has honored for nearly ahundred years'' by making state and municipal bonds subject topossible federal taxation.   In the union handbill case from Florida, the court ruled on an8-0 vote that although federal labor law generally prohibits unionsfrom engaging in ``secondary boycott'' picketing of neutralemployers, it does not ban non-picketing activities aimed at suchbusinesses.   The controversy began when the Florida Gulf Coast Building andConstruction Trades Council, a union, sought to publicize itsgrievances against the High Construction Co., which was building astore in the East Lake Square Mall in Tampa.   The union alleged that High offered substandard wages andbenefits.   Rather than picket or patrol the mall, union members handed outliterature urging a total consumer boycott of the 85-store mall.   After the union refused to modify the handbills to make clear ithad no dispute with the mall's owner or any of the tenant stores,the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., which owns the mall, filed an unfairlabor practice claim against the union.   The National Labor Relations Board ruled that the union's actionwas banned by federal law, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals said that reading labor law to ban such handbilling wouldraise ``serious constitutional issues.''   By reading federal labor law to allow the union's handbilling,the justices avoided having to decide the constitutionalfree-speech issue presented by the case.   In a separate decision, the court ruled by a 6-2 vote in aCalifornia case that forcing employers to provide free, internalmail delivery for labor union literature aimed at organizingemployees violates the federal law giving the U.S. Postal Service amonopoly.   The justices reversed a decision by the state Public EmploymentRelations Board granting the free mail delivery for Local 371 ofthe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.   The union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against theUniversity of California in 1979 after being denied free use of theintercampus mail system at its Berkeley campus.   In the alcoholism case, the court ruled by a 4-3 vote that theVeterans Administration, in denying benefits to two men, did notviolate a federal law protecting the rights of the handicapped.   The court did not decide whether alcoholism is a disease, butsaid the VA is not compelled to regard it as such.</TEXT></DOC>
