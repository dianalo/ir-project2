Characterization methods include thermal analysisby DSC and measurements of inherent viscosities, wide-angle X-ray diffraction,and viscoelasticity. The melt flow properties of both amorphous and semicrystallinesamples were also investigated by means of a parallel plate plastometer.This material was found to be not readily recrystallizable at temperaturesabove its initial peak melting point of 225 C, when compared to othercrystalline thermoplastics. This semicrystalline PISO{sub 2} demonstrateda flow about 5 times greater than the amorphous one as characterizedby the plastometer. Such enhanced melt flow properties could be of greatbenefit in the adhesive and composite lamination processes. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
