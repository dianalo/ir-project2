The latest edition of the popular independent weekly Reform saidGrosz topped the list of its ``The Year's Reform Man'' survey with22.9 percent of nearly 5,000 votes received.   Pal Emoed, a Reform editorial board member, told the radio lateSaturday that ``not even'' 500 votes had arrived in the magazineoffice. He told the radio that of those votes, Grosz finished secondto Imre Pozsgay, a minister of state and leading reformer.   Emoed gave no figures and did not say who was responsible forpublishing the allegedly false results.   The public admission of error was extremely unusual in aCommunist country, even in Hungary, where the media have becomeincreasingly open over the past year.</TEXT></DOC>
