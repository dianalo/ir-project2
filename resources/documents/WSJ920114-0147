The Venezuelan reduction, announced Friday in Caracas bythe oil minister, Celestino Armas, is a modest 50,000 barrelsa day. But it's apparently succeeding in what it was designedto do -- send a signal to sluggish world oil markets and toothers in OPEC.</LP><TEXT>   World oil prices, which had fallen about $5 a barrel sinceOctober because of oversupply worries, rose sharplyyesterday. In U.S. futures trading, February crude oil was up56 cents a barrel to $18.79. February heating oil jumped morethan three cents a gallon to 54.6 cents on the New YorkMercantile Exchange.   The Venezuelan announcement, which was officially relayedto OPEC headquarters in Vienna yesterday, was a factor in thegains. Another, oil analysts said, was a report that SaudiArabia, the leading producer, may agree to an immediate cutin OPEC's total output at the meeting of the oil ministersthat begins Feb. 12.   The Saudis have resisted urgings of some other OPECmembers that an emergency meeting be held before then torestore production quotas because of deteriorating prices.The Saudis also have held that only production levels for thesecond quarter should be discussed at the Feb. 12 meeting inGeneva and that any reductions would have to be shared on apro-rata basis by all members of OPEC.   But the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey, whichhas close links to the Saudis, reported yesterday that thereis &quot;an emerging consensus&quot; in OPEC that any new output leveldecided upon in Geneva should go into effect immediately. Thepublication also said Saudi Arabia &quot;would possibly accept&quot;such an arrangement if price weakness persists.   Saudi oil sources previously indicated they would considerreducing second-quarter output by 500,000 barrels a day fromits recent level of 8.5 million barrels a day if marketconditions warranted it and if others in OPEC made comparablecuts. Yesterday, some OPEC and industry sources suggestedthat Saudi Arabia may quietly move sooner to cut productionby beginning some oil-field maintenance programs now ratherthan later.   Oil analysts said any reductions in OPEC output, even ifrelatively modest, should help firm up oil markets. &quot;A 5% cutwould stabilize oil markets and put a floor under prices,&quot;said George Gaspar, first vice president, petroleum research,at Robert W. Baird andamp; Co. in Milwaukee.   Mr. Gaspar, who is also author of the Gaspar Report, hasbeen expecting West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmarkcrude, to fall to $17 a barrel because of oversupply andsluggish demand. He said that if Saudi Arabia and others inOPEC don't agree to reduce production at their Februarymeeting, the U.S. price will fall below $15 a barrel, itslowest since the oil-price crash of 1986.   OPEC's production has been climbing for several monthseven though Iraq still is banned by the United Nations fromexporting its oil. Output recently reached its highest levelin more than a decade and currently exceeds 24 millionbarrels a day. Meanwhile, the average of the basket of sevencrudes used by OPEC as a price measurement has been falling.It was down to $16.57 a barrel last week; it briefly touchedthe $21 mark last fall.   Worried by such price deterioration, several oil ministershave been in frequent contact with one another in recentdays, OPEC sources confirmed yesterday. And in taking thefirst step toward curbing output, Venezuelan officials saidtheir goal is to see OPEC return to the production ceiling of23.65 million barrels a day that had been set for last year'sfourth quarter and this year's first quarters.   &quot;The hope is that when we meet in February, people {OPECmembers} will have voluntarily reduced to the 23.65 million,&quot;said Gonzalo Plaza, the Venezuelan governor to OPEC andchairman of the OPEC governing board in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
