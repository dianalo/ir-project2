 The also is atest bed for an 800-megabit/set multipath crossbar switch capable of linking32 nodes, some or all of which could be supercomputers.andM;The crossbar switch comprises crossbar interfaces and a switching core.andP;  Eachport on the crossbar switch has two ANSI HPPI channels.andP;  Each channel on the32-bit crossbar switch can carry data 80 times faster than Ethernet and 16times faster than Network Systems Inc.'s Hyperchannel.andM;The switch, developed jointly by Los Alamos and Digital Equipment Corp., willundergo five years of testing to resolve the problems of high-speednetworking among heterogeneous systems.andM;Los Alamos operates one of the world's most elaborate and powerful computingenvironments.andP;  Its Integrated Computing Network serves more than 8,000 peoplewith a hub of Cray Research Inc. supercomputers, IBM Corp. mainframes and amassively parallel computer from Thinking Machines Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.andO;This hub supports a huge distributed network of machines from many othervendors.andM;Until now, high-speed networking at the lab has relied on 50-megabit/secsupercomputer data links designed inhouse.andP;  John Morrison, who leads thelaboratory's Computer Network Engineering Group, said two simultaneous needsbrought about the decision to develop the 800-megabit/sec crossbar switch.andM;First was a long-term network modernization plan.andM;&quot;We needed to improve performance and make it more reliable, more availableand easier to maintain,&quot; Morrison said.andP;  &quot;As our network has grown morecomplex, we've had to deal with new security issues.andP;  We also recognized wehad to stop building our own solutions and move toward an open architecture.&quot;andM;Second, Los Alamos scientists had been demanding better visualization tools.andO;Astrophysicist Karl-Heinz Winkler played a key role.andM;&quot;Dr.andP;  Winkler proposed viewing movie images on a workstation to visualize howthe fluid flow calculations run on the Cray,&quot; Morrison said.andP;  &quot;Allsupercomputer centers face this problem of visualizing supercomputercalculations.andP;  Waiting minutes or hours for output devices to display graphskeeps the scientists from optimizing their own analytical abilities.&quot;andM;To display a low-resolution moving picture takes about 20 frames per secondat 512- by 512-pixel resolution.andP;  With eight bits of color, getting that manyframes of data from the Cray to a workstation requires about 42 megabits ofbandwidth.andM;Higher resolutions need displays capable of 1,000-by-1,000 resolution.andO;Coupled with a higher color resolution of 24 bits, the bandwidth for 30frames per second goes up to 755 megabits/sec.andM;One solution might be to attach a workstation directly to the Cray's800-megabit channel, but that would not be very cost-effective use of asupercomputer.andP;  Clearly a high-speed network based on an ANSI-standard800-megabit channel would be better because it could connect multipleworkstations.andM;Gigabit questionandM;At the time the lab decided to develop a high-speed network, existingcommercial technologies could support peak data rates of only 50megabits/sec.andP;  Although products such as Ultra Network Technologies Inc.'sUltranet 1000 and Scientific Computer Systems Corp.'s Vectornet now cantransmit gigabits per second, questions remain as to whether they will beable to meet the simultaneous full-bandwidth networking demands of scientificcomputation.andM;Los Alamos engineer Michael McGowen then learned of a proprietary DigitalEquipment Corp. video RAM (VRAM) chip that had the memory ports necessary forframe-buffering Cray computations for a workstation.andM;&quot;We needed to move graphics data directly off the network to the displaywithout going through disks or backplanes,&quot; McGowen said.andP;  &quot;The VRAM has fourasynchronous serial memory ports and a random access port.andP;  It answered bothour need to produce real-time video and our need to build high-speed,multipath networks.&quot;andM;The VRAM chip became the basis for an intelligent network interface to acrossbar switch.andP;  Each crossbar interface provides network management andcontrol for two ANSI HPPI simplex channels.andP;  A fully configured crossbarswitch could support as many as 62 simultaneous ANSI HPPI simplex channels.andM;Using ANSI HPPI 25-meter copper cables, hosts can be up to 100 meters apart;current fiber-optic equipment from Integrated Photonics Inc. of Carlsbad,Calif., can extend that distance up to four kilometers.andP;  The researchers hopeeventually to test the interface in a gigabit fiber-optic network acrosslonger distances.andM;&quot;Our idea has been to keep it very simple initially,&quot; McGowen said.andP;  &quot;Westarted with the need for visualization.andP;  Ultimately the real problems wewant to get to are large clusters of top-end machines.andP;  If we can couple themtogether to do very complex computations, such as visualizing physicscomputations in three dimensions, we can go on to larger specialized displayneeds.&quot;andM;Under the lab's joint project with Digital, the core switch is being built byLos Alamos, with the crossbar interface developed by Digital.andM;&quot;The crossbar interface is a high-speed, store-and-forward, packet-switchedprotocol processor,&quot; said Digital project manager Bill Hedberg.andM;The lab also encouraged other vendors to build compatible interfaces.andP;  Lastsummer, an IBM 3090 Model 600 became the first machine to connect toDigital's crossbar interface.andM;The Los Alamos team, working closely with engineers from Digital, IBM andCray, has taken a leading role in defining an HPPI standard.andP;  ANSI X3T9.3grew out of a definition first proposed by McGowen and his colleagues in1987.andM;More than 80 computer vendors now support X3T9.3, with approval expected in1990.andM;ANSI HPPI paves the way for supercomputer centers to start distributing theirapplications across high-speed networks.andP;  A new national research networksupporting gigabit-per-second data exchanges over fiber optics ultimatelycould make supercomputing power much more accessible.andM;Win Quigley manages the VAX supercomputer gateway for Digital Equipment Corp.andO;and is part of the engineering team in Albuquerque, N.M., that is buildingthe crossbar interface.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
