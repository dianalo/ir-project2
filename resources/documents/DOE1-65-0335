A three-compartment model is developed and used to simulatethe 24-h concentration profile within the shower, bathroom, and remaininghousehold volumes of a dwelling. Mass transfers from water to air arederived from measured data for radon and adjusted to account for thedifference in mass-transfer properties for VOC's. A preliminary database for household parameters is used to calculate a range of concentrationsand human exposures in U.S. dwellings. The model is used to estimateexposure factors for seven compounds-chloroform, ethylene dibromide,dibromo-chloropropane, methylchloroform, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene,and carbon tetrachloride. The calculated ratio of indoor-air exposureto tap water concentration is compared to measured values for one ofthe compounds, chloroform. A sensitivity analysis is used to identifyimportant parameters. 21 references, 3 figures, 8 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
