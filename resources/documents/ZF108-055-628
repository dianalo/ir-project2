(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Pipeline The power of graphical software is evident all around.andP;  Whether it'sa spreadsheet that can be manipulated with a mouse or a word processor thattruly shows what your printer will give you, applications are starting toprovide some of the benefits that Windows and OS/2 promised.andM;Yet the full potential of graphical software design is far from realized.andO;1990 is shaping as a year when we'll start to see just how valuable graphicalinterfaces can be.andM;This summer, Microrim plans to ship a client-server database that combinesstandard relational DBMS tools with an easy-to-use application generator thatmakes full use of OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  With a few pull-down-menuchoices, you'll be able to build database front-ends that outshine the bestwork of expert dBASE programmers, and you'll be able to incorporate graphicsin any record.andM;Vanguard, is the results of a massive development project that began atMicrorim within weeks of IBM's 1987 announcement of OS/2.andP;  Developed in C tobe portable, Vanguard will run first on OS/2, and soon after it will bereleased for Macs, DEC VAX/VMS, IBM MVS and VM, and in several Unix versions.andM;Rather than enhance R:BASE (which runs under DOS and OS/2 in character mode),Microrim decided early on to use a completely new core database that couldfully realize the potential of device-independent graphical platforms.andO;Although the company will provide translators to convert R:BASE applications,Vanguard continues a complete break with the kind of traditional programmabledatabase that R:BASE represented.andM;The Vanguard report creation toolbox, for example, consistst of icons fortext, dates, pictures, radio buttons, and check boxes.andP;  Entry forms don'tneed to be simple fill-in-the-blank affairs; they can be designed to matchprinted forms, right down to the tiniest detail.andP;  Part numbers can becomplemented by scanned photos, company logos can grace printed reports, andanyone can build his own menu-driven database application with a few mouseclicks.andM;Vanguard will form queries in ANSI-standard SQL and use a two-phase commitcontrol.andP;  Microrim says it's willing to use the protocols that the SQL AccessGroup is developing (see Pipeline, PC Magazine, January 16, 1990), offeringthe promise of someday being able to query any SQL server seamlessly.andP;  Rightfrom the start, Vanguard is expected to have links to OS/2 Extended Editionand dBASE Files.andM;In addition, various levels of security will give database administrators aneasy way to control the extent to which they allow customization ofapplications.andM;To ensure that the program's relational tools are readily accepted, Microrimhas spent a great deal of its development dollars on user tests.andP;  Not contentto accept SAA's common-user-access (CUA) standards as the last word ininterfaces, the company appointed a director of usability, with the authorityto control keystroke combinations and to guarantee that Vanguard has a fewdifferences as possible across the various platforms.andM;For the first 18 months of development, only the database kernel was written.andO;Not until the interface tests produced comments like &quot;It's easier than Excel&quot;did the programmers begin to program the surface code.andM;For all its innovation, though, Vanguard will still be judged on performancewhen it hits the market.andP;  And it will have to generate a lot of heat tomuscle past Oracle's SQL Server, Microsoft/Ashton-Tate's SQL Server, Novell'sforthcoming NetWare 386 SQL, and the growing roster of other products fromvendors who sense a growing market in the SQL server area.andM;Those who are looking to graphical movements to further leverage theirinvestment in PCs, however, are likely to find Vanguard one of the mostpromising developments of 1990.andM;Flash Memory HasandM;Enormous PotentialandM;Intel's continuing research into EPROM (erasable programmable read-onlymemory) techniques is close to perfecting memory chips that hold theircontents without power and can withstand thousands of read/write cycles.andM;Called ETOX (erasable tunnel oxide) or flash memory, the chips will be usedin portables due out later this year from Psion and start-up Pair Computer.andO;The devices cost about half as much as static RAM chips.andM;Flash memory chips are actually slightly revised EPROMs.andP;  The basis 1970design for the EPROM centers around a silicon gate that's insulated fromelectrical charges by an oxide coating in order to keep the chip's memoryalive.andP;  Intel's recent experiments found that a small reduction in the amountof oxide used to insulate that gate dramatically improves the chip's capacityfor reading and writing.andM;Flash memory requires about 2 seconds for reprogramming before data can bewritten, a speed comparable to floppy disk access.andP;  Reads, however, arelightning-fast--150 or 200 nanoseconds.andP;  The first uses of flash memory willbe to replace EPROMs, providing more flexibility in what's stored.andM;Pair Computer plans to use flash memory for a portable's system BIOS, astrategy that gives users the opportunity to keep the code recent.andM;Psion's portable will use flash memory chips for plug-in storage cards.andM;Flash memory has enormous potential to become the portable PC's standardstorage device, since it saves notebook PC makers from the expense ofbuilding in the extra battery backup required to keep static RAM alive.andM;On-Line Mailing Lists aandM;Growth MarketandM;On-line and CD-distributed databases cover hundreds of special needs, but oneof the most commonly used databases--the phone book--lags behind.andM;In the Northeast, NYNEX sells NYNEX Fast Trax, a CD that lists everypublished phone number within NYNEX's jurisdiction.andP;  At $5,495 for an annualsubscription, updated monthly, few people are likely to experiment with theservice.andP;  That's a big loss for marketers, since search software is apowerful tool when applied to the phone directory.andM;A small company in Atlanta now has a modified version that's pay-as-you-go,thanks to a 900 number.andP;  The PC Yellow Pages is a database of businessesacross the nation that can be queried on-line.andP;  For $1 per minute, you cansearc at 1,200 or 2,400 bits per second, using ZIP code or company specialtyas the criterion.andP;  Once the query has been completed, you download your listin comma-de-limited ASCII format.andM;The service is designed to help marketers looking to compile lists, notbusiness people seeking specific information.andP;  Both types of service arelikely to become huge businesses in time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
