<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0235 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor, each of the {similar_to}400 hot pressure tubes containing the fuel bundles and the pressurizedheat transport water is surrounded and insulated from the cold moderatorby a calandria tube. The pressure tubes are made from cold-worked Zr-2.5Nb with a minimum wall thickness of 4.19 mm, and the calandria tubesare made from annealed Zircaloy-2 with a minimum wall thickness of 1.37mm. The annulus between these two tubes contains an inert gas. Leak-before-breakhas developed into an operational tool in CANDU reactors to prevent unstablefailure of pressure tubes. A procedure for leak detection and reactorresponse has been developed from the use of the annulus gas, whose dewpoint is measured to ascertain if leaks have crept into the annulus.The characteristics of the crack are used to establish the response timefor leak detection. The reactor is required to be shut down before thelength of the slowly growing crack has reached the critical stage. Thiscritical crack length, determined using slit burst tests on tubes, isthe crack length at which the crack growth becomes unstable. The mostlikely crack growth mechanism is delayed hydride cracking. This mechanismrequires three conditions to occur simultaneously: the material mustbe sensitive to delayed hydride cracking; zirconium hydrides must bepresent in the material; and the tensile stress must be sufficientlygreat.</TEXT></DOC>
