STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials on Friday said a West Germancomputer spy ring that sold stolen data to the Soviets represents anew and dangerous dimension in international espionage.   ``The illegal entry into hundreds of data systems is an extremelydangerous new threat,'' federal Interior Minister FriedrichZimmermann said.   ``Governments and businesses must now become extremelyvigilant,'' Zimmermann said a day after officials said they hadpenetrated a ring of ``hackers'' who sold thousands of passwords andcodes from military and research computers in the United States,Western Europe and Japan to Soviet intelligence agents.   Zimmermann, whose ministry is responsible for counterespionageand domestic intelligence-gathering, called the hackers' operations``a new dimension of Soviet bloc spy agencies.''   Although he said it was too soon to assess the full extent of thedamage, he added the investigation had ``succeeded in dealing amajor blow against the KGB Soviet secret service.''   Juergen Schmid, a spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry,called the incident ``extremely serious, but not drastic.''   ``The hackers were able to gain entry, but failed to penetratedeep into the secret areas of the databanks,'' he said.   Security officials Friday said three men were in custody andanother five were under investigation.   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal Prosecutor'sOffice, said the suspects range in age from 25 to 35.   He said several were involved with illegal drugs, but did notelaborate.   Prechtel said police in Hanover arrested two hackers on``suspicion of espionage activities for an Eastern Europeanintelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,he said.   Officials of the federal Criminal Investigation Office inWiesbaden said more than 100 state officers and federal agents wereinvolved in making the arrests and in subsequent searches ofapartments in West Berlin, Hanover and Hamburg.   A West German broadcast network, Norddeutsche Rundfunk, saidThursday the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers includedthe U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus; aNASA and a Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' researchcomputer; and computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy researchat the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the FermiNational Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.   The network said attempts were made to gain access to theLawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, whichit called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at thelaboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken intothrough an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not havepasswords for classified information.   ``We were amazed. Here's some guy breaking into an astronomycomputer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying tosearch for information about SDI, about nuclear warheads,'' Stollsaid in an interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory atHarvard University, said he and other researchers helped break thespy ring. He said someone linked to East bloc groups wrote the labasking for related information, leading authorities to the hackers.   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,Ill., said Soviets participate in research there.   ``So there are Soviet scientists living at Fermilab and using thecomputers. There isn't anything confidential or strategic in thecomputers,'' Bardeen said.   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, saidhe knew of no evidence a foreign intelligence agency had gainedaccess to its classified computer system. He said none of the lab'sfindings were secret.   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said the three suspects were detainedfollowing searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin andHanover.   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the threehackers were recruited by the KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cashand drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes andpasswords to the Soviets.''   The network said the three handed over information from theUnited States, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and WestGermany at a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.   The hackers obtained information that would allow the Sovietsthemselves to gain access to the computers and develop technologybased on the information, the network said.   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging toseveral European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospaceresearch, the network said.   Officials at the European Laboratory of Particle Physics inGeneva said attempts were made in 1986 and 1987 to gain access tothe lab's computers. A laboratory offical, who asked not to beidentified, said Soviet and other specialists have been visitingresearchers at the facility for years.   In Brussels, European Economic Community officials said the WestGerman hackers had penetrated a European Space Agency computer inParis.   Willy Helin, a spokesman for the EEC's Research andTelecommunications Commission, said specialists are trying todetermine whether suspected Soviet agents had also gained access toother EEC computer networks.   In Tokyo, a lab official said unknown West German hackers brokeinto a computer system in a Japanese government research lab in 1985.   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that aresearch project was penetrated in mid-1985, said lab spokesmanShinichi Watanabe. He said no sensitive information was stolen, andthe lab has since heightened security by changing passwords andother measures.   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of thealleged West German ring.</TEXT></DOC>
