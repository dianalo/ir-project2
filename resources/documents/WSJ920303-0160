A self-hating Democrat, incomposite, is a former Democratic official who is nowemployed as a corporate lobbyist, sneers at any mention ofMichael Dukakis and Walter Mondale (despite having voted forboth), and believes deep down in his bilious soul that only asecond Great Depression will put another Democrat in theWhite House.   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts is not a self-hatingDemocrat. Though he shares with that band a tart tongue andan understanding that his party is in trouble, Mr. Frank hasnot succumbed to cynicism. The most engaging thing about&quot;Speaking Frankly: What's Wrong With the Democrats and How toFix It&quot; (Times Books, 164 pages, $18) is Mr. Frank's buoyantmessage that the Democrats' problems can be solved fairlyeasily without abandoning core convictions. Mr. Frank isprobably too sanguine about the party's troubles, but surelyhe's right that overcoming them will require optimism andintegrity.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Frank's thesis is that by catering too much toleft-wing groups mired in 1960s antagonisms, the DemocraticParty has lost mainstream voters in presidential elections.That's a familiar criticism; what's new is that it is beingmade by a liberal still willing to call himself one.   Unlike many such critiques, Mr. Frank notes that theDemocrats still have a lot going for them politically.Congress remains in Democratic hands, and probably notbecause Democratic incumbents have rigged the system in theirfavor. (Taking aim at the term-limits movement, Mr. Frankwisecracks: &quot;As a legislator I must be in the only professionin the world where a high degree of consumer satisfaction istaken as a sign that something is radically wrong.&quot;) Mostgovernors are Democrats too, he writes, so it's hard to saythe party lacks executive talent.   Moreover, on most issues that matter to swing voters, Mr.Frank argues persuasively, Democrats have a clear advantage.These voters tend to like the idea of further expansion ofmedical-care programs, more federal aid for education, andmore vigorous protection of the environment.   So why do Democrats have so much trouble getting electedpresident? Because, says Mr. Frank, unlike state andcongressional contests, presidential elections turn not onissues but on values. To cite a popular caricature, votersdon't want to send to the White House politicians who lovecriminals and hate the American flag.   This stereotype may be unfair, yet it persists as aresidue of the '60s, when many liberals were seduced orintimidated by radical chic. Mr. Frank makes much of theDemocrats' need to face down the radical fringe when itresorts to hysterical denunciations of U.S. perfidy at homeand abroad. That advice seems a bit out of date in the '90s,when, except for in a few places like Northampton, Mass., andTakoma Park, Md., the Birkenstock legions are looking fairlybedraggled.   More useful is Mr. Frank's suggestion that fellowDemocrats abandon lingering taboos against voicing supportfor mainstream values, which Mr. Frank labels &quot;notsapostas.&quot;Democrats, Mr. Frank writes, are &quot;notsaposta&quot; state tooenthusiastically that America is a force for good in theworld, or that inner-city criminals should be heldresponsible for their crimes, though that's what mostbelieve. To do so, many fear, would feed jingoism and racism;but not to do so, Mr. Frank notes, allows publicmisperceptions to stand.   On crime, for example, Democrats throughout the '80sfailed to win themselves much public favor for advocatingmore aid to the very city and state governments that arrestand incarcerate most violent criminals. &quot;Ronald Reagan andGeorge Bush have done far more to protect Denmark and Belgiumfrom attacks by Poland and Hungary than they have to protectelderly Americans from attacks by punks in theirneighborhoods,&quot; Mr. Frank complains, with some reason.   Mr. Frank's particular ideas about how Democrats can beatthe values rap are a bit sketchy, varying from renaming thepost-Cold War peace dividend the &quot;victory dividend&quot; to easingup on the exclusionary rule and preventive detention todropping federal requirements for a 55 mph speed limit. Onissues such as the death penalty and gun control, where coreliberal beliefs are at war with a sizable chunk of publicopinion, Mr. Frank advocates not surrender, but &quot;prudence.&quot;   Being a politician, Mr. Frank dodges some of the tougherissues. At a time when the public is indifferent or evenhostile to the plight of the poor, Mr. Frank does not askwhether his fellow Democrats have a duty to resume moralleadership. Nor does he pay much heed to the mounting cost ofmiddle-class entitlements and their contribution to aparalyzing deficit that has put federal innovation on holdfor more than a decade. Instead, Mr. Frank puts his faith ina peace -- whoops -- &quot;victory&quot; dividend that has yet tomaterialize.   The most vexing issue Democrats face today is what to doabout racial discrimination. Mr. Frank has little light toshed on this achingly difficult question, except to observewith characteristic Frankness that the public has latelyshown more tolerance for the disabled and gays than forblacks. That Mr. Frank, who is openly gay, refuses toconsider himself a victim has helped keep him from beingmarginalized as the Gay Congressman. Of his many lessons tofellow Democrats, this may be the most valuable of all.   ---   Mr. Noah is a staff reporter in the Journal's Washingtonbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
