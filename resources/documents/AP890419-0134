It is rare for a congressman to make such bluntly criticalcomments in public about Israel.   The administration is asking to maintain the same level of aidto Israel _ $3 billion, the most of any foreign nation.   Obey said he had raised his concerns with the Bushadministration and with Israel and all he had received were``words.''   A State Department official who handles U.S. ties with theMiddle East, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Ned Walker, saidthe administration continues to urge Israel to stop the practice.``We're not satisfied,'' he said.   But Walker also expressed sympathy for the Israeli soldiers,saying he had been in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and seen themhaving to deal with violent Palestinian demonstrators. ``It'sdifficult for them,'' he said of the soldiers.   More than 400 Palestinians have been killed in a violentuprising launched 17 months ago to protest Israel's 21-year rule ofthe West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Walker praised some recent Israeli measures such as the releaseof more than 450 Palestinian inmates, the unsealing of some housesblocked by Israeli forces as punitive measures, and the restorationof loudspeakers to Arab mosques. But he said Israel's ``record isstill mixed,'' as shown by last week's shooting by security forcesof at least five Palestinians in the West Bank village of Nahalin.   Israeli military regulations allow soldiers to shoot plasticbullets at demonstrators fleeing the scene of a violentdemonstration. Israeli spokesmen say plastic bullets are lesslethal than other ammunition, but dozens of Palestinians have beenkilled _ some shot in the back _ because soldiers fired from closerthan the required distance.</TEXT></DOC>
