Now we'll have to grapple with new tax forms.    Many people haven't yet completed their income tax returns for 1986, which are due April 15. But whether or not they have, some accountants recommend doing a rough draft now of the returns for 1987 and 1988 to see how taxes will change as the new tax law grabs hold. (The Internal Revenue Service probably won't finish drafting a 1987 return until late August.)    The accompanying work sheet is particularly timely for an estimated 650,000 filers with incomes above $50,000 who would owe less tax for 1988 than for 1987. These filers should consider deferring some income from 1987, with its five tax rates of 11% to 38.5%, until the following year, when the top rate is 33%, advises Ira Shapiro, director of tax policy for Coopers andamp; Lybrand, the accounting firm.    Filers also should review their W-4 withholding or estimated tax payments soon, if they haven't already done so. The new law has increased -- to 90% from 80% of current-year tax -- the amount of such payments required to avoid an underpayment penalty.    The work sheet doesn't include any computations for taxpayers who might be subject to the toughened alternative minimum tax. That sheet follows below.    INCOME   --WAGES, SALARY. Enter as usual on all three lines, including tips and bonuses.    But there's a stricter limit for 401K salary-deferral plans: In 1987 and 1988, you must report as income any contributions over $7,000, compared with $30,000 in 1986. (Contributions generally are excluded from the wages listed on the W-2 form you receive from your employer.)    --INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS. Record all taxable interest income. In listing dividends for 1986, exclude as much as $200 for a married couple or $100 for a single filer. But enter all dividends starting with 1987, as the partial exclusion has been repealed.    --NET CAPITAL GAIN OR LOSS. Long-term capital gains will be taxed the same as ordinary income for 1988, a sharp rise from 1986's top rate of 20% on such gains. For 1987, net long-term gains are taxed at a maximum 28% although short-term gains may be taxed more heavily.    To calculate the work sheet entry for any year, combine short-term gains with short-term losses, long-term gains with long-term losses; then offset the two to produce one figure. On the 1986 line of the work sheet, enter the amount from the familiar Schedule D.    But 1986 is the last year in which you can exclude from income 60% of your net long-term capital gains. For 1987 and 1988, you must include all such gains. (A net long-term capital gain is any gain that results from combining all long-term items, minus any loss that results from combining all short-term items.)    If you have capital losses for 1987 and 1988, each dollar of long-term losses can be used to offset a full dollar of taxable income, rather than the previous 50 cents of income. Don't report for any year an overall loss bigger than $3,000. Excess losses still can be carried over to future years.    --RENT, LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, SHELTERS. For 1986, enter as usual here from Schedule E. For the later years these items will appear farther down the work sheet in the &quot;passive&quot; category, because Congress has restricted deductions for tax-shelter losses.    --INCOME OR LOSS FROM A BUSINESS. For 1986, enter as usual. For 1987 and 1988, enter only the results from businesses in which you actively participate, including sole proprietorships, general partnerships, working interests in oil and gas properties and S corporations. Remember that starting in 1987, some asset-depreciation schedules are less favorable.    --OTHER INCOME. Include state and local tax refunds. Unemployment compensation, for which a partial exclusion can be taken in 1986, must be fully reported starting in 1987.    --TOTAL INCOME. Add all categories of income.    ADJUSTMENTS   --KEOGH PAYMENTS AND ALIMONY PAID. Enter both on this line.    Figure your total income minus Keogh and alimony payments and jot it down here: ...... . This figure will determine how much of any rental-property loss you can deduct for 1987 and 1988, as the new law gradually cracks down on this and other popular tax shelters.    --PASSIVE LOSS OR INCOME. So-called passive activities are generally businesses in which you don't &quot;materially participate.&quot; These include some rental activities, tax shelters, real estate interests, all limited partnerships, some long-term equipment leasing operations and oil and gas royalty interests, and other activities that often produce losses. The work sheet entry is the sum of the following TWO figures:    1) Allowable real estate rental loss: Consider your income after Keogh and alimony payments. If this income is below $100,000, you may take the full loss from renting out your property, up to a maximum loss of $25,000. If income exceeds $150,000, you're allowed no deduction for rental losses here. If income is in between, record rental losses up to a limit that equals the following: $25,000 minus 50% of the amount by which your income exceeds $100,000. Record your allowable loss here: ...... .    2) Other passive losses or income: In this section, include rental losses that were disallowed under provisions in the preceding paragraph, or rental income. Add these together with any other passive income or losses. If the net result of this calculation is an overall loss, multiply it by 65% for 1987 and 40% for 1988 to get the allowed figure, and enter it here (if the result is a gain, also enter it here): ...... .    Add (1) and (2) and enter the result on the work sheet.    --TAXABLE SOCIAL SECURITY. People who receive Social Security payments must pay tax on as much as half of them, if other income exceeds certain levels. The income levels at which Social Security starts becoming taxable are $32,000 on a joint return, $25,000 for single filers and heads of household, and zero for married people who live in the same house but file singly.    Income, for the purposes of this calculation, consists of the following: Total Income from the worksheet, plus any tax-exempt interest earned, minus Keogh payments and alimony paid, minus (for 1986 only) the individual retirement account deduction and employee business expense, combined with (for 1987 and 1988) passive income or losses to the extent allowed on the worksheet.    --IRA AS MODIFIED. For 1986, enter the individual retirement account deduction as usual. For 1987 and 1988, compute your total income after Keogh and alimony payments, results of passive activities and the addition of taxable Social Security income. Make a note of the figure here: ...... . This income figure will determine what tax break, if any, you'll get for an IRA.    For 1987 and 1988, you get no tax deduction if either you or your spouse is covered by a pension plan and combined income exceeds $50,000. Enter the whole IRA contribution only if combined joint income is below $40,000 or neither spouse is in a pension plan.    If joint income is $40,000 to $50,000 and at least one spouse is in a pension plan, reduce each spouse's limit on allowed IRA contributions by 20% of the excess of combined income over $40,000. (Single filers and heads of households begin losing their IRA deduction at $25,000, and lose all of it at $35,000. Heads of households generally are unmarried people who support a child or parent living in the same home.)    --TWO-EARNER DEDUCTION, MOVING, EMPLOYEE BUSINESS EXPENSE. The deduction for a married couple when both work is scuttled after 1986, and the moving expense deduction moves farther down on the return onto the &quot;other&quot; line. Unreimbursed employee business expenses become tougher for itemizers to deduct as they move down into the &quot;miscellaneous&quot; category starting in 1987; non-itemizers lose this deduction completely starting in 1987. (Reimbursed employee business expenses will be treated as in the past.)    --ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME is derived by combining the Total Income line with the five lines beneath it on the sheet.    DEDUCTIONS   --MEDICAL AND DENTAL. For 1987 and 1988, the only deductible medical expenses are those in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income, a stricter test than the 1986 figure of 5%.    --CERTAIN STATE TAXES. Include state and local sales taxes for 1986 only; these are non-deductible starting in 1987. But continue to deduct state and local income taxes, and property taxes.    --CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. After 1986, these are deductible only by people who itemize deductions. Non-itemizers lose the deduction.    --INTEREST ON FIRST AND SECOND HOMES. Mortgage interest on two residences remains fully deductible in all three years. But for loans incurred after last Aug. 16, don't deduct interest on loan amounts exceeding the original cost of the home, plus home improvements and mortgage borrowing for medical or educational purposes.    --ALLOWED CREDIT CARD, AUTO LOAN AND OTHER INTEREST. Interest on so-called consumer loans, such as charge card and auto loans, is fully deductible for 1986. But this deduction is being phased out, so enter only 65% of such interest on the line for 1987 and 40% for 1988.    --ALLOWED INVESTMENT INTEREST. The deduction for investment interest costs, such as interest on loans used to buy stock, eventually will be limited to net investment income. But up to $10,000 of the excess interest expense (beyond investment income) is 65% deductible for 1987 and is 40% deductible for 1988. The disallowed part can be carried forward indefinitely to offset investment income.    --MISCELLANEOUS AND EMPLOYEE BUSINESS EXPENSES. Miscellaneous expense is fully deductible for 1986 but a tantalizingly elusive deduction afterward. Starting in 1987, deductions such as union dues, professional journals, job-hunting costs, fees paid to tax preparers and investment counselors, and some tuition expense will be allowed only to the extent that they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.    Unreimbursed employee business expense, currently deductible in computing adjusted gross income, in 1987 will become a miscellaneous itemized deduction subject to the 2% floor. But include in this calculation only 80% of the cost of unreimbursed employee meals and entertainment expense.    --OTHER. For all three years, other allowed deductions are casualty or theft losses in excess of 10% of adjusted gross income, and gambling losses to the extent of gains. Starting in 1987, also include unreimbursed moving expenses here.    --TOTAL ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS. Enter an itemized deduction total. For 1986 only, subtract from the total the zero bracket amount of $3,670 on a joint return or $2,480 on a single return.    --TOTAL DEDUCTIONS. Enter on the work sheet the larger of the standard deduction or allowed itemized deductions. (But don't enter any standard deduction for 1986 as it is incorporated into the tax rate tables.) Non-itemizers in 1986 may subtract charitable contributions from adjusted gross income.    The 1987 standard deduction is $3,760 on a joint return and is $2,540 for single filers and heads of households. The 1988 standard deduction is $5,000 on a joint return, $3,000 for singles and $4,400 for heads of household.    --EXEMPTIONS. The exemption for each filer and dependent is $1,080 for 1986, $1,900 for 1987 and $1,950 for 1988. For 1986, you can add an exemption for each blind person, one more for each filer aged 65 and over.    --TAXABLE INCOME. Itemizers will arrive at taxable income for all three years by subtracting total deductions and personal exemptions from adjusted gross income.    For 1986, non-itemizers should subtract personal exemptions and charitable deductions from adjusted gross income. For 1987 and 1988, non-itemizers should subtract personal exemptions and the standard deduction.    Non-itemizers who are blind or more than 65 years old in 1987 and 1988 get an extra standard deduction of $600 per condition on a joint return or $750 per condition on a single return. An elderly or blind person also gets the higher 1988 standard deduction in 1987.    --TAX FROM TABLE. Look at the tables to the right of the work sheet to find your tax for 1986 and 1988. Do the same for 1987 unless you listed on the work sheet a net long-term capital gain. If you had such a gain, figure a flat 28% tax on that gain and then add the table's tax on the remaining taxable income.    Congress has scheduled a phase-out of the lowest, 15% tax rate for higher-income taxpayers starting in 1988. You don't need to calculate the impact as it is already incorporated into Coopers andamp; Lybrand's tables.    --CREDITS, 1988 SURCHARGE. For 1988, certain higher-income filers must pay a surcharge to phase out the benefit of personal exemptions. On the form below, calculate a surcharge only if taxable income exceeds $149,250 on a joint return or $89,560 on a single return, and $123,790 for heads of households.    1) Write $149,250 if joint filers, $89,560 if single and $123,790 for head of household: ...... .    2) Multiply number of personal exemptions by $10,920: ...... .    3) Add (1) plus (2): ...... .    If taxable income is greater than (3), multiply (2) by 5%. Otherwise subtract (1) from taxable income and multiply the result by 5% to find your surcharge.    The Total Tax is calculated by subtracting child-care, foreign and other tax credits, including credits for some low-income and elderly people. Limitations on credits generally get stricter after 1986, the last year in which the political contribution credit is allowed. For 1986, 1987 and 1988, the investment tax credit is generally unavailable.    ---   How Your Tax Bill Will Change   This work sheet was compiled with help from Coopers andamp; Lybrand.
