<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-33-0874 </DOCNO><TEXT>A molecular phylogeny for the hominoid primates was constructed by usinggenetic distances from a survey of 383 radiolabeled fibroblast polypeptidesresolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). An internally consistentmatrix of Nei genetic distances was generated on the basis of variantsin electrophoretic position. The derived phylogenetic tree indicateda branching sequence, from oldest to most recent, of cercopithecoids(Macaca fascicularis), gibbon-siamang, orangutan, gorilla, and human-chimpanzee.A cladistic analysis of 240 electrophoretic characters that varied betweenape species produced an identical tree. Genetic distance measures obtainedby 2DE are largely consistent with those generated by other molecularprocedures. In addition, the 2DE data set appears to resolve the human-chimpanzee-gorillatrichotomy in favor of a more recent association of chimpanzees and humans.</TEXT></DOC>
