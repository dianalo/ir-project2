During a brief appearance before a cheering group of hercolleagues and students at the University of Oklahoma Collegeof Law, Prof. Hill said she was &quot;deeply hurt and offended bythe attacks on my character.&quot; She said she would not&quot;dignify&quot; any of the attacks with a response, except to saythat she was &quot;not imagining the conduct to which Itestified,&quot; namely her explosive allegations that she wassexually harassed by Judge Thomas.</LP><TEXT>   After Prof. Hill passed a lie-detector test Sunday,Republicans pressed speculation that she is emotionallyunstable and believes her allegations even though they areuntrue. Previously, GOP lawmakers portrayed her variously asa snubbed woman, a perjurer, a publicity seeker or a tool ofliberal interest groups out to get Judge Thomas.   As today's showdown vote on Judge Thomas's confirmation tothe Supreme Court neared, Sen. John Danforth also released anaffidavit from Washington lawyer John L. Burke Jr. criticalof Prof. Hill. Mr. Burke, formerly a partner with theWashington law firm of Wald, Harkrader andamp; Ross where Ms. Hillbegan her legal career, disputed Ms. Hill's testimony thatshe was never asked to leave the firm. Mr. Burke stated inthe affidavit, dated Sunday, that he told Ms. Hill in 1981that her work was so below par that she should find anotherjob.   That charge is false, according to other partners who werein a better position to know Prof. Hill's status at the firm.&quot;That is not correct,&quot; said Robert Wald, the founder andformer managing partner who is married to Judge PatriciaWald, one of Judge Thomas's colleagues on the U.S. Court ofAppeals in Washington. &quot;Anita Hill was an associate in goodstanding.&quot; The firm was dissolved in the late 1980s.   &quot;She was well-regarded and left of her own volition,&quot;agreed Robert Skitol, another former Wald, Harkrader partner,who said Mr. Burke was in no position to know about Prof.Hill's job performance because he wasn't involved in theevaluation of associates. And Donald Green, who headed thefirm's associate development committee, submitted a statementto the Senate Judiciary Committee last night stating thatProf. Hill left in good standing.   Sen. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who has shepherdedJudge Thomas through the confirmation process, said thedelusion theory was &quot;a kinder and gentler explanation&quot; ofProf. Hill's recollections than simply to call her a liar.Judge Thomas denies Prof. Hill's allegations.   Sen. Orrin Hatch, Judge Thomas's chief GOP defender on theJudiciary Committee, said, &quot;People say she's a liar, and I'mnot ready to say that.&quot; The alternative, he said, was &quot;apsychological explanation.&quot; The Utah Republican added, &quot;Ibelieve that she believes she's telling the truth.&quot;   The strategy seemed designed to provide political coverfor senators who needed to explain away Ms. Hill's successfullie-detector test, which Sen. Hatch claimed Thomas supportershad anticipated. Only psychopaths and deluded people,administration and congressional Republicans stressed, areadept at passing lie-detector tests. &quot;If people reallybelieve in what they're saying, they're not going to be shownto be deceptive on a lie-detector test,&quot; Sen. Hatch charged.   As they were during last weekend's hearings, Democratsgenerally were reluctant to serve as advocates for Prof.Hill. On Sunday, Sen. Edward Kennedy did admonish hiscolleagues on the Judiciary panel, saying, &quot;I hope we're notgoing to hear a lot more comments about fantasy stories.&quot;   Yesterday, the Massachusetts Democrat issued a statementthat said &quot;There is a very strong likelihood that ProfessorHill is telling the truth.&quot;   Women's rights organizations rushed to Prof. Hill'sdefense. Kate Michelman, executive director of the NationalAbortion Rights Action League, said the attacks on Prof. Hillsent a message to victims of sexual harassment that &quot;if awoman comes forward, she will pay. She will be a victim ofcharacter assassination.&quot;   Louise Fitzgerald, a professor of psychology at theUniversity of Illinois who appeared with Ms. Michelman at anews conference organized by women's groups and othersupporters of Prof. Hill, said senators are unfit to serve as&quot;psychological diagnosticians.&quot;   Before Prof. Hill made her brief public appearanceyesterday, a group of her colleagues issued a statementexpressing their continued belief in her credibility. &quot;Webelieve the attacks on her psychological well-being andpolitical motivation in coming forward lack any foundation infact,&quot; their statement said.   While Sen. Danforth emotionally decried &quot;the dirt&quot; thathad been thrown at Judge Thomas, he denied that speculatingabout Ms. Hill's mental health was unfair. Even so, WhiteHouse officials insisted President Bush had no hand in thecharacter attacks. Administration lobbyist Frederick McClureinsisted that the suggestion that Prof. Hill is a scornedfantasizer was the idea of Republican senators on theJudiciary Committee. Over the weekend, President Bush hadquestioned Prof. Hill's credibility.</TEXT></DOC>
