On Nov. 14, 1986, six months after arresting a pudgy investmentbanker named Dennis Levine for insider trading, prosecutorsannounced they had landed their biggest fish, Ivan F. Boesky.   He stole $50 million through sleazy trades. He schemed toconceal ownership of stocks and duped investors. He spun a web ofskulduggery that included junk-bond giant Drexel Burnham LambertInc. and its master financier, Michael Milken.   ``If my mistakes launch a process of re-examination of the rulesand practices of our financial marketplace, then perhaps some goodwill result,'' Boesky said after paying $100 million in fines andrestitution and agreeing to plead guilty to one criminal charge.   Ivan Boesky's wish has come true.   In the three years since Boesky Day, Wall Street has drasticallychanged the way it does business.   The insider trading scandal has been a dominant theme in adecade when investment firms grew fat on multibillion-dollartakeover deals and rewarded baby-faced college graduates withsix-figure salaries.   For some, fraud and greed were a byproduct of success. For theJustice Department, prosecuting well-dressed criminals created abattle subculture reminiscent of Eliot Ness vs. Al Capone inProhibition-era Chicago.   Criminal and civil prosecutions unprecedented in the history ofthe nation's financial markets snared violators from a 24-year-oldjunior analyst to a 63-year-old magazine editor.   Watching the scandal unfold was like watching a movie, and itbecame the breeding ground for cinema, books and television.   When police handcuffed a broker on a trading floor in the 1987film ``Wall Street,'' it resembled a day in February 1987 whenprosecutors seized a veteran trader at venerable Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co. while disbelieving colleagues watched. The incident proved anembarrassment for prosecutors, however, when they had to drop thecase against the trader for lack of evidence.   The scandal also became the testing ground for aggressive use ofthe criminal racketeering law dubbed RICO, previously reserved forMafia thugs and drug lords, to prosecute investment bankers inBrooks Brothers suits.   Prosecutors used the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law to force Drexel into a deal it couldn't refuse:Plead guilty to securities felonies or face severe fines and apotentially embarrassing trial.   Perhaps most significant, the scandal forced Wall Street toreassess and reform in a decade of unbridled paper wealth built ona mix of youth, money, ambition and myopia.   ``I was so focused on my career and getting ahead that I reallylost touch with reality, lost perspective,'' Levine, now 36, toldbusiness students in New York this summer.   Since Levine's arrest, more than 30 people and three companieseither have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a range offinancial crimes in cases brought by the Manhattan U.S. attorney.   The crackdown led to a vastly expanded use of criminalsecurities laws to include stock manipulation and disguisingsecurities ownership, behavior previously handled by the civilcourts.   Milken, the Wharton MBA who pioneered Drexel's domination ofhigh-yield securities known as ``junk bonds,'' has been indictedunder RICO for dealings with Boesky.   Prison terms have climbed, to four years for Florida takeoverspecialist Paul Bilzerian, convicted in June. Boesky is up forrelease in April from a three-year term at a minimum-securityprison in Lompoc, Calif. Levine was paroled in September 1988 afterserving 17 months of a two-year term.   ``There's not a lot of sympathy for guys who make $500 million ayear cheating,'' said Harvey Pitt, a Washington securities lawyerwho represents Boesky. ``Judges have become a lot tougher.''   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani orchestrated thecorruption crackdown and used it as a springboard for anunsuccessful bid for New York City mayor. The securities unit ofthe federal prosecutor's office has grown to 20 people from threein 1986.   ``They've overindicted and indicted for conduct which should notbe charged as criminal,'' said Stanley Arkin, a New York lawyer whohas defended several Wall Street figures targeted by Giuliani.   ``I think when you rape, rob, pillage, extort, these things havean inherent kind of evil to them _ far more than an inappropriatetax straddle or a conflict between a lawful and an unlawfulrumor,'' Arkin said.   On Wall Street, the insider trading scandal has changed the waybusiness is transacted. Arbitragers who speculate in stocks ofpotential takeover targets and the investment bankers who financethe deals say the days of careless information-swapping are gone.   ``Bankers just won't pick up calls from arbitragers. They justscreen them out,'' said a 27-year-old investment banker at a majorWall Street firm who spoke on condition he not be identified.   Market participants say they have seen a decline in long runupsin the stock price of takeover targets before a deal is announced,possibly indicating less information is leaked in advance.   Investment firms have increased the number of complianceofficers monitoring trades and spent millions on new technology.The New York Stock Exchange has boosted its market surveillancestaff to 109 from 85 in 1986.   ``Taking the action against Boesky, taking the action againstDrexel has put the Street back on an even keel,'' said Gary Lynch,the former SEC enforcement director who helped spearhead the majorinsider trading cases and is now a private attorney in New York.   Investment firms have hired lawyers who wield significantpolicy-making power. Firms have rewritten rules and added ethicslectures to training programs. Many brokerages now requireemployees to clear personal stock transactions in advance to avoidany possible suggestion of wrongdoing.   For those on their way to Wall Street, top business schoolsincluding Harvard have added required ethics courses.   ``I certainly think it heightened the awareness of Wall Streetfor the potential for disaster if business isn't being conducted inthe right way,'' said Joel Cohen, head of mergers and acquisitionsfor Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.   Kidder closed its arbitrage department after paying $25.3million to settle civil insider trading charges stemming from theBoesky scandal.   ``There was an `it can't happpen here' attitude before that,''said Kidder's general counsel, John Liftin. ``To find there was awillful violator in the middle of things was a real shock toeverybody.''   The scandal has produced drama ranging from courtroom face-offsto an alleged plot to kill Boesky.   When Milken pleaded innocent, hundreds of reporters andspectators jammed Manhattan federal court. Drexel loyalists sportedhats reading ``Mike Milken We Believe in You'' and cheered theirhero.   When speculator John Mulheren Jr. feared he was about to beimplicated, he loaded an assault rifle with the intent of shootingBoesky, police said. He was seized en route. Mulheren since hasbeen indicted for securities fraud. He still faces weaponspossession charges.   The highest drama, however, may be yet to come, a courtroomconfrontation featuring high-priced Milken attorney Arthur Limangrilling Boesky on the witness stand at Milken's trial, set fornext year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 12</NOTE></DOC>
