MossbergStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP BA MDAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Talks between the U.S. and the European Community over European government subsidies for Airbus jet aircraft are deadlocked, according to a senior Reagan administration official.    The official, who briefed reporters on the condition his name be withheld, said the gulf between the U.S. and European positions on the issue is so great that the president's cabinet would consider in January whether even to continue talks on the issue. He said there is little hope now of settling the issue unless top government officials decide to change the two sides' positions.    The official said the U.S. may have to consider next month what to do if the talks don't get back on track. He said the possibilities included filing an unfair trade practice complaint in the U.S. against Airbus Industrie, the government-subsidized consortium of British, French, German and Spanish aircraft companies that competes with Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. Such a complaint could be filed either by the administration or by the U.S. industry.    The U.S. trade representative's office has been meeting with the Europeans since October in an effort to resolve U.S. complaints that Airbus is unfairly robbing sales from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The U.S. contends that massive European government subsidies to the consortium's four member firms permit it to sell planes at uneconomically low prices.    The Europeans counter with claims that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas also get subsidies, indirectly, through military contracts with the Pentagon. But the U.S. official said that Washington can prove that the four members of Airbus get as much or more help from military sales in addition to the outright subsidies for the commercial jet project.    Airbus is a grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    &quot;The talks have been going on in a very friendly fashion,&quot; the U.S. official noted. But he added, &quot;It just so happens we are very far apart.&quot;    He charged that &quot;the reason we're not close is that the fundamental European position is that for Airbus to survive, it must have the right -- whether exercised or not -- to forever get a subsidy.&quot; The Airbus dispute, he said, has ballooned into &quot;the single most important trade issue between the U.S. and Europe for the rest of the decade.&quot;    The administration decided to brief a few reporters on the issue partly to put pressure on the European side and partly to counter recent comments in Europe that the talks were going well.    Ironically, one such comment was made by Alfred Kingon, the U.S. ambassador to the EC, just before last week's semiannual ministerial meetings between the U.S. and European Community. Mr. Kingon said it was &quot;not unrealistic&quot; to expect the meetings would yield a tentative Airbus accord.    The senior official said yesterday that, at the time of that statement, the talks were &quot;nowhere near&quot; a settlement and that the meetings failed to resolve the dispute.    The official said the U.S. objects to four key European bargaining positions on Airbus.    First, he said, the Europeans want to continue their practice of providing Airbus with government loans at rates well below market levels, and then waiting for repayment until after each plane is sold. Second, he said, the Europeans demand the right to give Airbus subsidies to make up for unfavorable swings in exchange rates.    Third, he said, the European governments are demanding the right to bail Airbus out if it fails. He conceded, however, that the U.S. has also done this with Lockheed Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Finally, he said, the Europeans want a vague &quot;anti-monopoly&quot; clause in any agreement that might permit subsidies to assure Airbus a minimum market share.    The senior official charged that the Europeans would be happy if the U.S. would informally agree to a cartel arrangement giving Airbus 30% of the world jetliner market, which currently is dominated by Boeing. But he said the U.S. wouldn't agree to that.    Nevertheless, the administration may have little leverage in the situation. Even if a U.S. unfair trade practice action resulted in a complete or partial ban on Airbus sales in the U.S., European nations would retaliate by barring Boeing and McDonnell Douglas from their market. In that case, the two sides might wind up, in effect, with the very shared cartel the U.S. hopes to avoid.    The U.S. estimates that the four Airbus countries have poured $10 billion into the consortium since it was started 17 years ago. Washington says they are planning to spend an additional $3.2 billion on two new aircraft lines Airbus plans to produce.    Without the subsidies, the U.S. official charged, Airbus would fail, even though he said it outsold Boeing in jumbo jets world-wide last year. </TEXT></DOC>
