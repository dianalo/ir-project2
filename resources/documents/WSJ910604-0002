More than 50 companies, including Xerox Corp., UnisysCorp., Honeywell Inc. and Holiday Inns Inc. make up the newlycreated Group Annuity Participant Protection Association.</LP><TEXT>   Members have pension funds invested in instruments issuedby Los Angeles-based Executive Life, generally a smallportion of overall pension-fund assets at each company. Thepension funds cover about 250,000 employees and retirees, theNew York-based organization said.   More than $1.1 billion in guaranteed investment contracts,a form of group annuity that covers pension planparticipants, were sold by Executive Life to qualifiedpension plans. The new organization is asking a state courtin Los Angeles overseeing the conservatorship of ExecutiveLife to approve payments on pension fund contracts whilecontinuing to exclude payments to holders of about $1.85billion in municipal bonds that are backed by very differentfunding agreements bearing the same name.   By court order, death benefits of Los Angeles-basedExecutive Life are being paid in full and annuities at 70cents on the dollar. There are no payments to holders ofguaranteed investment contracts, although Californiainsurance commissioner John Garamendi has said corporatecontracts will eventually rank equally with other annuities,while the municipal bond claims will rank junior, a positionthat is contested by bondholders.</TEXT></DOC>
