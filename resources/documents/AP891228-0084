SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush is completing plans to have theU.S. military interdict drug supply routes from Latin America, theWhite House said today. A defense official said one proposalincludes drawing a ``much, much tighter noose'' around Colombiawith a virtual air and sea blockade.   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, confirmed that ``final plansare now being made'' to interdict ``supply routes in South andparts of Central America,'' but he offered no specifics.   The overall program is evolving from proposals that seniormilitary commanders submitted to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He,in turn, relayed them to the White House.   Fitzwater, speaking with reporters today in Corpus Christi,Texas, confirmed that Bush is mapping plans to use the U.S.military to disrupt the drug supply routes from Latin America.   ``We have decided to take certain actions to help the countriesof Latin America interdict those supply routes,'' he said. ``We areanxious to work closely with Colombia. Whatever actions we wouldundertake in this regard will be done with the closest consultationwith them and coordination with them.''   Bush is slated to attend an anti-drug summit in Colombia inFebruary.   Although the military's interdiction operation could be launchedbefore the summit, the senior defense official declined to offer astart-up date for the maneuver.   ``It's supposed to be a big-time operation,'' said the official,who spoke on condition on anonymity. ``We want to make itimpossible for any drugs to come out of there by air or sea.''   The operation would involve positioning an aircraft carrierbattle group and its accompanying air wing off the Caribbean coastof the South American country, the source said in a recentinterview.   The Pentagon official stressed that there would be no questionof U.S. military shooting down planes flown by suspected drugdealers.   ``There are no plans to start blowing people out of the sky,''the official said. ``The role would be one of support and focus onforming a much, much tighter noose.''   The official said the plan was being formulated in cooperationwith the Colombian government and is not designed to impede theexport of legal products.   The official cautioned there were problems involved in such aneffort. First of all, he said, the plan could be delayed becausethe U.S. military's attention has been diverted by the Panamainvasion.   And ``one weak link'' in the massive operation could be thehand-off to Colombian authorities, who are expected to take up theenforcement role, he said.   In addition, the official pointed out, because the drug problemis so pervasive, the drug lords most certainly will choose moreland routes to move their illicit products.   ``They've got a lot of money and they're not fools,'' theofficial said. ``We know this is a hydraulic problem. No sooner doyou squeeze and close off one route than it spurts out throughanother.''   The official said the plan could be altered by the president.   The maneuver targets Colombia ``because that country is one ofthe major flow points (for drugs). We are proposing a virtual airand sea blockade,'' the official said.   The Navy will play the key role in the operation, the officialsaid, because of its ability to put airborne warning and controlplanes, E-2C ``Hawkeyes,'' in the air from carriers.   Such planes, with saucer-like radar equipment mounted on theirframes, are able to keep tabs on drug-smuggling suspects in planesor ships because they can track surface and air targets over a wideregion.   The anti-drug summit is slated to be held in Cartagena, a portcity 680 miles north of Bogota. It is located in a Medellin cartelstronghold in a country ravaged by bombings and assassinationssince Colombian President Virgilio Barco declared war on the drugtraffickers three months ago.   Peru has decided to resume joint anti-drug operations with theUnited States a week after canceling the activities as a protest ofthe U.S. military intervention in Panama, U.S. and Peruvianofficials said Wednesday.   The Peruvian Embassy said joint operations resumed because ``thefight against drugs is so important.'' Last week, Peru alsocanceled plans to participate in the summit.</TEXT></DOC>
