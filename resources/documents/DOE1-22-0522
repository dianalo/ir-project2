The modeling issues are discussed, and several new aspectsof this problem are described, including gyromotion, radial electricfield, and sawtoothing. Existing models predict that TF ripple loss offast alphas will have a low-to-moderate impact on the design of a tokamakengineering test reactor (ETR). 52 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
