The initiative comesafter several weeks of debate among various Cabinet agencies and consultationswith such major arms suppliers to the region as Britain, France, China and theSoviet Union. Several arms suppliers have resisted any moves to limit sales,and without their cooperation, Bush's proposal would stand little chance ofslowing arms proliferation in the region.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUSH TO PROPOSE MIDEAST ARMS LIMITS; SALEOF LONG-DISTANCE MISSILES TARGETED  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Washington News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910427  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  107  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 27, 199100118047,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
