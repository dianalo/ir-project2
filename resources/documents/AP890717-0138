The government said it must have a formal letter of request fromthe United States before it could release an American photographercaptured last month after entering the country with guerrillas.   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said he had given SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposals from the United Nations forending the 11-year-old war between the Soviet-sponsored governmentand Moslem guerrillas. Gandhi returned to New Delhi from a six-daytrip to France, the Soviet Union and Pakistan.   Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry,said at least 68 guerrillas had been killed since Sunday in agovernment offensive around Surkdewar, 75 miles southeast of Kabul.   Amani did not give details of either offensive, and noindependent confirmation of the government claims was available.   After Gaziabad, Amani said, the army would aim for Torkham,believed to be the last guerrilla outpost in the east. Gaziabad is100 miles east of Kabul _ about 20 miles from Pakistan _ and Torkhamis 6 miles from the border.   The seven main rebel groups fighting to overthrow the communistgovernment are based in Pakistan.   ``For every step we take now, we are consolidating the last threesteps we have taken,'' Amani said. ``Our eventual aim is to marchtoward Torkham and free our territory from our opponents.''   Gaziabad has three large orange and olive farms that serve asbases for the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who began fighting after acommunist coup in April 1978.   Guerrillas have controlled the area since before the Soviet Unionsent soldiers to Afghanistan in December 1979. Soviet militaryforces completed a U.N.-mediated withdrawal Feb. 15.   American photographer Tony O'Brien, 43, was arrested June 8 at aguerrilla hideout in Kabul while on assignment for Time-Life.   Although the government has decided in principle to free him,Amani said, ``we will need a letter from the American governmentasking us to release Mr. O'Brien. We hope the American consularofficer who is in town is carrying such a letter, which should alsoauthorize her as the representative of the American government.''   Renny Smith from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, who arrivedSunday to oversee the release, would not comment on the Afghandemand. ``I was told everything was OK; in fact, I have bookedmyself to return on Tuesday,'' she said.   Gandhi did not give details of the U.N. proposals he passed toGorbachev, but described them as incomprehensive and inadequate. Hesaid Gorbachev's reaction was similar.   India, a Soviet ally of long standing, was the only noncommunistcountry to recognize the Afghan government after the coup in 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
