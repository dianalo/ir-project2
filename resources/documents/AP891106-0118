About 6,000 employees of privately owned South African Brewerieswent on strike to press for a wage increase of 38 percent. Thecompany has refused to revise its offer of a 16 percent raise, andsays it will agree to mediation on other contract matters only ifthe wage dispute is left off the agenda.   Throughout the strike, the company has accused the Food andAllied Workers Union of sanctioning violence against employees whocontinued to work. One workers's house was burned down, and armedguards were placed aboard some delivery trucks after a driver waskilled in Durban.   The trade union congress, in its boycott call, urged ``all ourpeople to conduct this campaign in a peaceful and disciplinedmethod.''   Anticipating the possibility of a boycott, the company last weekexpressed concern that it would be enforced through coercion.   ``People are being asked to lose their jobs and theirlivelihoods in solidarity with peple who are refusing one of thehighest wage packages in the country,'' the company said.   The company's wage offer would raise monthly pay for itslowest-paid workers to about $400. That is more than twice theminimum wage for members of the National Union of Mineworkers, thelargest black union.   Blacks consume about 80 percent of South Africa's beer, and thenational association of black tavern owners has agreed to supportthe boycott. However, the main association of black liquor storeoutlets has declined to do so, saying their customers would simplyturn to white-owned stores.   South African Breweries produces all four leading beer brands inSouth Africa, which imports relatively small quantities of beerfrom abroad. The strike has affected seven of the company's 11breweries, but production has continued and no reports of severeshortages have surfaced yet as summer approaches.   There have been no contract negotations since the strike began,although the union last week suggested the two sides agree tomediation.</TEXT></DOC>
