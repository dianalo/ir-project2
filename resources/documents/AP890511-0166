Public Citizen, the study's sponsor, said the potential forrenewable energy can only be reached if the Energy Departmentspends substantially more on research and development.   The group, which strongly advocates reduced reliance on nuclearpower and fossil fuels that are linked to the trend toward globalclimate warming, said the Energy Department budget for renewablesshould be restored to the 1985 level of $263 million. The currentbudget provides $115.6 million, and the Bush administration hasproposed cutting that to $86.5 million in the next fiscal year.   Renewable energy sources currently supply about 8 percent oftotal U.S. energy needs, including imports of electricity generatedfrom Canadian hydro plants, the study said. The figure could riseto 19 percent by the year 2000, and to as high as 80 percent by2010 if prices for conventional energy sources go up, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
