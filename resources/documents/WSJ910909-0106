But Shahid Khan isone Danville industrialist who doesn't see Japan as a threat.   Mr. Khan is the founder and owner of Bumper Works. Hissmall company has a factory in Danville that employs about100 people pounding out the lightweight pickup-truck bumpershe designs. His principal customers are Japanese auto makers,including Toyota Motor Corp., whose standards are veryexacting.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was nothing Toyota could teach us,&quot; says Mr. Khan,about engineering low-cost bumpers. But as to running abumper factory, Mr. Khan is more humble. &quot;We {had}benchmarked ourselves against the American industry,&quot; hesays. &quot;I don't think we knew how bad we were.&quot;   Toyota, a world leader in factory efficiency, did know.But rather than take its business elsewhere, the Japaneseauto giant did something it had never done before. Itdispatched a team of manufacturing experts to a U.S. company-- Mr. Khan's bumper plant -- to conduct a crash course inthe Toyota Production System, the lean-manufacturingdiscipline hailed by three Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology researchers in their recent book &quot;The Machine ThatChanged the World.&quot; Now, productivity at Bumper Works is up60% from a year ago; the number of defects has been reducedby 80%.   This is a recent, little-known side to U.S.-Japaneseindustrial competition. Even as some American manufacturersdemand more protection from Japanese rivals, U.S. companiesare looking to the Japanese not just as potential customersbut as teachers. Sometimes the complainers and thehelp-seekers are the same people. General Motors Corp., forinstance, which charges that Toyota is dumping minivans inthe U.S., is at the same time sending hundreds of engineersfor training to a plant it shares with Toyota. Ford turnedits Wayne, Mich., car factory into a clone of a Mazda MotorCorp. plant. A United Technologies Corp. plastics plant inKentucky is working to improve quality with the help ofToyota consultants.   A growing number of little companies like Mr. Khan's aretrying to learn from Japan, too. The result is a quiet,company-by-company revitalization of U.S. industry.   At the same time, Japanese companies such as Toyota arefinding that it pays to buy American -- and to share know-howwith U.S. companies -- if only to blunt anti-Japanesesentiment in Washington. As Detroit's Big Three struggle tostanch huge losses, Japanese companies have increased theirshare of the U.S. car market (including Japanese cars sold bythe Big Three) to nearly 36%, from 31% two years ago.Japanese auto executives worry that they must become more&quot;Americanized&quot; in order to head off calls for limits onmarket share similar to those negotiated in Europe. Butpolitics is only one factor. Cutting costs is another.   &quot;It's not altruistic,&quot; says Mark Santucci, an automotivecomponents industry consultant in East Lansing, Mich. &quot;Toyotais out to help Toyota.&quot;   Japan's critics say the changes are insubstantial.Japanese purchases of U.S.-made auto parts rose fivefoldbetween 1985 and 1990, to $9.1 billion, according to theJapanese Automobile Manufacturers Association. But that is arelatively small slice of the $103 billion U.S. partsindustry.   &quot;Toyota uses only 190 American suppliers. That's out of4,000 major American suppliers,&quot; says Sean McAlinden,coauthor of a University of Michigan study of Japaneseauto-parts buying patterns. The study predicts the U.S. willhave a $22 billion auto-parts trade deficit with Japan by1994, more than double the current deficit.   Such gloomy forecasts create political problems for Japanin Washington. Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, whosedepartment will rule on the minivan issue, in June blastedJapan's &quot;noncompetitive market&quot; for vehicle parts.   But even before these charges were lobbed, Japanese automakers, knowing that they are the biggest contributors to theU.S. trade gap, were making more overtures to U.S. companies.   The Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association thissummer held its second annual conference to bring togetherJapanese manufacturers and U.S. suppliers. The Las Vegasevent attracted executives from 11 Japanese vehicle makersand 83 U.S. companies. Nissan Motor Co. says it will buy $2.3billion a year in American-made parts by March 1993, an 80%increase from the fiscal year that ended March 31. Toyotavows to increase total U.S. parts purchases to $3 billion in1992 from less than $1.1 billion in 1988.   &quot;We are urging American suppliers to come to us,&quot; says H.Kamimura, corporate manager for Toyota's Southfield, Mich.,purchasing office. But he warns: Working for Toyota &quot;takescommitment and resources.&quot;   Mr. Khan knows all about that. A naturalized U.S. citizenborn in Pakistan, Mr. Khan in 1970 took his new mechanicalengineering degree from the University of Illinois to a jobwith an Urbana, Ill., bumper maker called Flex-n-Gate. By1978, Mr. Khan was sure enough of his low-cost truck bumperdesign to quit Flex-n-Gate and form Bumper Works with $13,000in savings and a $50,000 Small Business Administration loan.By 1980, Mr. Khan was able to buy out his old employer.   Mr. Khan made sales calls to Toyota for five years beforelanding his first contract with the company in 1985. Then, in1987, Toyota told Mr. Khan and two other bumper makers todesign new bumpers considerably more durable than Big Threespecifications require. Such demands from Japanese companiesare common, U.S. supplier executives say.   &quot;We were the only one who could demonstrate we could dothat,&quot; Mr. Khan says. In 1988, his firm became sole supplierof bumpers to U.S. facilities where Toyota attaches rearbumpers and other accessories to trucks made in Japan.   Bumper Works's ties to Toyota seemed secure. But Toyotawanted more. It expected annual price reductions -- despiterising costs for materials and labor. It also wanted betterbumpers and more punctual deliveries. A tall order.   In September 1989, Toyota flew Mr. Khan and one of hisaides to Japan for a round of meetings and tours of Toyotafactories. Mr. Khan, who had never been to Japan, got afirsthand look at the Toyota Production System in operation.He talked with Toyota management about improvements he couldmake. &quot;Their question,&quot; Mr. Khan recalls, &quot;was, `Is theresomething inherently Japanese about the system? Or is itpossible to export it?'&quot;   In March last year, Hiroshi Ginya, a manufacturing expertfrom Toyota headquarters, made the trip to Danville. Toyotawanted to help, he said. But there was little Toyota could dofor Bumper Works until it cut the time it takes to changedies in the metal stamping presses to less than 22 minutesfrom 90 minutes or more. Only then would Bumper Works beflexible enough to make 20 different bumper models each day.   Bumper Works couldn't afford new presses with quick-changefeatures. So, with Toyota's help, Mr. Khan's workersimprovised. They welded homemade metal tabs to their nine-tondies that made it much easier to line up the dies on pinsattached to the presses. Workers also videotaped die-changeprocedures and produced an instruction manual -- a BumperWorks first.   &quot;We had no organization,&quot; recalls die coordinator DavidHarmon. &quot;There were a lot of simple things we didn't thinkabout until the Toyota team came in.&quot;   By July 1990, Bumper Works achieved the die-changeobjective. Toyota then dispatched two more consultants fromJapan, Kazumi Nakada and Akio Toyoda, to lead what Mr. Khancalls &quot;boot camp.&quot;   Mr. Khan and his staff put in about two weeks of 16-hourdays turning the Bumper Works plant upside down. Virtuallyevery piece of equipment except the massive metal presses wasmoved. Employees had to relearn their jobs. Two of BumperWorks's six supervisors, including the plant manager,ultimately quit in frustration.   Toyota's goal is for a piece of raw steel to come in oneend of Mr. Khan's building and go out the other side the sameday as a finished bumper. With the old layout, bumpers wouldbe stamped, ride on forklifts to a storage area at the farend of the plant and -- days later -- return to the weldstations. Now, bumpers go from presses to welding with just abrief stop in between.   Workers with clipboards or blackboards record hourlyproduction and how it stacks up against established goals.The charts note the reason for any shortfall.   Bins of parts now are labeled, so it is easier to identifywhat's going where. When a batch of Toyota bumpers isshipped, a card is returned to the press operators, and theybang out more. Mr. Khan's employees now schedule their ownwork, rather than wait for a supervisor's direction.   The changes sound simpler than they really are, Mr. Khansays. Toyota had to send a second team last December to ironout some of the trouble Bumper Works had operating with lessinventory. Mr. Khan says he consults Toyota as problemsarise. &quot;They call it open kimono discussion,&quot; Mr. Khan says.&quot;I call it no kimono.&quot;   Slowly, the Toyota system is paying off, Mr. Khan says.Bumper quality has improved, and costs are coming down.Wasted metal cost Bumper Works $1.28 per bumper lastNovember. Now, that's down to 73 cents. Mr. Khan's companybegan to ship bumpers this summer for the first Toyotapickups built at the GM-Toyota joint venture plant inFremont, Calif.   Some of Toyota's rivals will benefit, too. Mr. Khan hopesto add 200 employees at a new factory of his just offInterstate 74 in Veedersburg, Ind. The floor plan has beendesigned with the Toyota production system in mind. But manyof the bumpers to be made there will go to Isuzu MotorsLtd.'s factory in Indiana. And with this added capacity, Mr.Khan is trying to woo the Big Three, which till now haveconsidered Bumper Works too small to be of use.   Toyota, meanwhile, plans to start doing for othersuppliers what it is doing for Bumper Works. A videotapestarring Mr. Khan and his employees is part of Toyota'spitch. About 10 businesses, including Minnesota Mining andamp;Manufacturing Co., want the training, says John D. Koenig, anexecutive with Toyota's U.S. sales arm. But for now, he says,Toyota is focusing on small suppliers because it doesn't havemany people to do the training.   Chrome Craft Corp., a company in Highland Park, Mich.,that applies chrome plating to Mr. Khan's bumpers, got theToyota treatment in March. Chrome Craft president, RichardBarnett, says he wasn't impressed with Toyota at first. Asworkers festooned his little factory with cardboard signs andhand-lettered charts, Mr. Barnett scoffed that it all &quot;lookedlike kindergarten stuff.&quot;   But now Mr. Barnett is a convert. Chrome Craft's qualityand productivity increased considerably after the Toyota teamleft, he says. Toyota will want a share of Chrome Craft'ssavings in the form of price reductions, Mr. Barnettacknowledges. But the quid pro quo doesn't worry him.   &quot;We're working with Toyota on a new bumper, and working totake all the mistakes out of the new bumper,&quot; he says. &quot;We'regetting better as an industry. If we don't, where's theAmerican manufacturing base going to be in 20 years?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
