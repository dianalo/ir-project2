Losing the guarantee on a defaulted loan would result in aloss to the loan holder. Sallie Mae, as the nation'sprincipal purchaser of student loans, could face exposure toits portfolio. And, as parent of University Loan Services,Sallie Mae could be made accountable to third-party loanpurchasers if paperwork concerning defaults is found to beimproper.   A Sallie Mae spokeswoman said that in the 14 months sincethe acquisition, University Loan Services has filed nearly$20 million in default claims.

It said thatcertain loan servicing information may have been improperlyaltered. The spokeswoman said she didn't have further detailson the nature of the discrepancies.   Although irregularities so far have been found in only oneloan, Sallie Mae appears to have launched a broadinvestigation of the practices of University Loan Services.&quot;We did see an uptick&quot; recently in rejected default claimsfiled by University Loan Services, said the spokeswoman.
