The test will involve releasing the model booster from ahelicopter to demonstrate that the booster can survive a waterlanding at 200 mph, said Space News, citing unnamed sources.   The Navy was asked for comment but did not immediately respond.   The only reusable space vehicles the United States has are theshuttle and its rocket boosters. The shuttle lands on a runway; theboosters drop into the ocean, are towed back to port to berefurbished for reuse.   ``The project is being conducted on a shoestring budget withNavy funds authorized by Navy Admiral Carlisle Trost, chief ofnaval operations, according to the Navy source,'' Space News saidin its Dec. 11 preview issue.   The rocket would take off from the ocean surface, which wouldprovide tremendous flexibility in launching secret missions. Thespent stages would be slowed in their fall and buoyed at thesurface by balloons.</TEXT></DOC>
