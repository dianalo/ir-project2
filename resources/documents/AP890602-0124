Although the number is a fraction of the 94,000 in the UnitedStates, the much smaller population of 26 million puts Canada inthe upper tier of countries on a per capita basis.   Leaders of AIDS community groups in major cities contend that,years after acquired immune deficiency syndrome became known, thefederal government still has not developed a a coherent nationalstrategy.   ``We're now in 1989; we've known about AIDS since 1982,'' saidRichard Burzysnki, executive director of the Canadian AIDS Society.``We should have been planning years ago.''   The Fifth International Conference on AIDS runs from Sundaythrough next Friday in Montreal and will bring together more than10,000 scientific, government and community leaders. Last year'smeeting was in Stockholm, Sweden.   Canada's federal policy for civil servants announced in May waspresented as an example of how the government can act effectively.It includes confidentiality and a statement that people with thedisease are not health risks to others under normal workingconditions.   The Toronto Globe and Mail called the policy ``a triumph ofcommon sense.'' It said Health Minister Perrin Beatty acted notmerely to soothe a lobby group, but ``because to do nothing wouldamount to setting off a ticking bomb.''   In Canada, the number of reported AIDS cases reached 2,736 atthe end of May, and 1,564 of the victims had died, according to theFederal Center for AIDS. The center says the total of cases isdoubling every 18 months, and unofficial estimates put the numberof Canadians infected at 50,000.   Just five years ago, the number of cases was 331, and 283 haddied.   Burzysnki, whose organization lobbies in Ottawa for 39 AIDScommunity groups across the country, said much of theresponsibility for health and education rests with provincialgovernments.   He said the efforts vary widely, and what is needed from thefederal government is ``the political will to galvanize'' thediverse levels and groups into an effective campaign.   Margaret Duckett, an AIDS expert at McGill University's Centerfor Medicine, Ethics and the Law in Montreal, said providinginformation on how to prevent the disease is not enough.   ``You need a range of messages, and you need people talkingone-to-one,'' she said. ``In that, there's been relatively littleoccurring in Canada.''   Nearly 90 percent of AIDS cases are in Ontario, Quebec andBritish Columbia, which have Canada's largest cities: Toronto,Montreal and Vancouver.   About 81 percent of the known cases are attributed to a riskfactor of homosexual and bisexual activity.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spreadmost often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared bydrug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnantwomen to their offspring.   Dr. Alastair Clayton, director of the Federal Center for AIDS,said the government has tried to promote educational programs andfinance community groups needed to carry them out.   ``There's never enough money to do all the things one wants,''he said by telephone from Ottawa. ``My job is to try to balance thefunding.''   A five-year budget of $167 million ($139 million U.S.) beginningin 1986 is divided among education, support for community groups,research and health and social services.   ``Canada isn't much of an example. The country's record ispretty abysmal,'' said Tim McCaskell of AIDS Action Now, which leda campaign for more liberal licensing of drugs for the disease.   National health insurance covers everyone, but does not includemedicine, housing or the other living costs that can accumulaterapidly for AIDS victims.   ``People with AIDS become poor very fast,'' said StephenManning, executive director of the AIDS Committee of Toronto.   His organization has new quarters, a full-time staff of 25 and abudget of $1.3 million ($1 million U.S.), about three-quarters ofthe money in grants from various levels of government.   It started six years ago above a poultry store.</TEXT></DOC>
