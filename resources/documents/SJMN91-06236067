We used to battle K.C. every year. Quizwas always like their Goose (Gossage).&quot;;   Thursday's save was Righetti's 20thof the season, making him only the fourth reliever in Giants history to recordat least that many in a season. The others were Greg Minton (21 in 1981, 30 in1982 and 22 in 1983), Gary Lavelle (20 in 1977, 1979 and 1983) and CraigLefferts (20 in 1989).; HOMECOMING: John Burkett's spot in the rotation wasmoved back a day so he'd pitch tonight in Pittsburgh, with the hope thatpitching in front of his hometown fans might give him a lift. Burkett, fromBeaver, Pa., has won both of his previous starts at Three Rivers Stadium,including a 5-3 victory over Zane Smith on June 4.; ETC.: Righetti said Sept.19 is the tentative date for his prematurely born triplets to be released froma Southern California hospital. The boy and two girls were born July 19, andRighetti said each weighs slightly more than 3 pounds. . . . Don Robinson,looking for his first victory since July 15, had a 9-4 lead and was two outsfrom being the pitcher of record when he was replaced by Kelly Downs in thefifth inning. &quot;I've got to win a ballgame and I can't worry about that,&quot;Manager Roger Craig said. &quot;I don't know if he was hurt and didn't tell me orif he just lost his rhythm.&quot; Robinson said he felt fine.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK NEWMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Houston  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910823  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  376  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, August 23, 199100236067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
