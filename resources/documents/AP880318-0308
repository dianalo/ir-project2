(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State officials moved Friday to recover$40 million they say American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has addedunfairly to the telephone bills of Connecticut customers during thelast two years.   In a complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission,the officials challenged the telephone company's right to add a 7.3percent surcharge on long-distance charges to recoup thegross-receipts tax it pays in Connecticut.   They argued that the surcharge imposed in Connecticut and nineother states violates the longstanding practice of having uniformtelephone rates across the country.   The other states where the surcharge is imposed are: Florida,Maine, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, WestVirginia and Wisconsin, according to the complaint filed with theFCC.   ``Since the early days of the telephone company, this countrywas built upon having an average rate throughout the country,''Consumer Counsel James F. Meehan said in announcing the action.   ``The thought was that people in Montana should be able to callpeople in Hartford at the same rate that people in Hartford ...call people in Montana,'' he said.   Meehan and Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman have formed analliance with the state Department of Public Utility Control inchallenging federal regulators for allowing ATandamp;T to impose thesurcharge.   The complaint seeks to recover the $40 million collected by ATandamp;Tso far and to eliminate the surcharge.   The FCC allowed ATandamp;T to add the surcharge in states with agross-receipts tax on long-distance companies starting in April1986. The surcharge in Connectict was initially 3.6 percent, butrose to 7.3 percent in January.   ATandamp;T is the only long-distance carrier regulated by the FCC,although other long-distance companies such as Sprint and MCI alsoadd the surcharge to their bills, Meehan said.   ATandamp;T officials responded that figuring the gross receipts taxinto its national rates would be unfair to customers elsewhere inthe country.   ``Only Connecticut residents benefit from the state grossreceipts tax on telecommunications companies, and thereforeConnecticut customers should pay those extra costs of doingbusiness,'' said Paul Karoff, an ATandamp;T spokesman in Connecticut.   Meehan said ATandamp;T came up with the idea of imposing the surchargein the 10 states with a gross receipts tax in order to generatemillions of dollars that would allow it to reduce rates.   Connecticut officials contend it is unfair given that the actualcost providing telephone service is lower in here than in manyother parts of the country because of the high volume of business.Connecticut is the 10th-largest telecommunications market in theUnited States and generates about $550 million in annual revenuesfor ATandamp;T, Meehan said.   Also, ATandamp;T doesn't add surcharges to recover other types oftaxes it pays, they said.   The officials acknowledged it may be difficult to convince theFCC to hold a hearing on the complaint, particularly since the FCCpreviously approved the surcharge. They vowed to take the case tocourt if the FCC refuses to hear it.   ``There are fundamental issues of how rates are set in thecountry,'' Meehan said. ``If we are successful, I think create somenew case law that will have major impact on rate setting practicesthroughout the federal system.''</TEXT></DOC>
