BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center has pouredbillions of dollars into the Houston area since 1962 but its trueeconomic value has only recently been recognized, and now thecenter is viewed as a key to prosperity.   Stripped of 225,000 jobs when the energy industry collapsed, thenation's fourth biggest metropolitan area suddenly found itselfwithout an economic anchor and sought another. What it found inpart was aerospace, most of it connected somehow to the spacecenter 25 miles southeast of town.   ``We frankly have never really focused on it until five or sixyears ago,'' said John Brock, president of economic development forthe Greater Houston Partnership.   The space center has pumped almost $40 billion directly intoHouston, and even with a reduced space program, the center spendsabout $3.7 million each working day.   ``The impact might be 10 _ maybe even 20-fold _ on the generaleconomy in Houston,'' Brock said.   Economist Robert Hodgin of the University of Houston-Clear Lake,said the space center, while an important contributor to theregion's economy, provided only a piece of the recovery.   ``What it did do, however, was to serve as ray of optimism,served as a magnet for other endeavors and served as a PR (publicrelations) tool for city leaders,'' Hodgin said.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration officiallyopened the facility on 1,620 acres of donated land in 1963 as theManned Spacecraft Center, directing the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab,space shuttle and other programs. It was renamed in 1973 to honorJohnson, who as vice president had a lot to do with its location inHouston.   The space center has served as both an employer of thousands:there are 3,250 federal employees on the payroll, plus another9,650 contractor personnel work at the center or support itsoperations. The center also spent $16.1 million last fiscal year onpublic utilities.   Besides the basic operations, however, Brock said the center hasbeen a draw to other aerospace companies such as Grumman Corp. andMcDonnell-Douglas Corp., both of which have major aerospaceoperations nearby.   Grumman came to Houston in the early 1970s to build the lunarmodule for the Apollo program, but in 1986 brought in its civilspace operations because ``Houston was still in the woes of the oiland real estate slump, so that made it very, very favorable forbusiness coming in,'' said Grumman spokeswoman Miriam Reed.   Plus, ``there's a terrific local labor force. Because of NASAand the universities, there are lots of high-tech people there interms of engineering and technical personnel.''   The slump, NASA and labor benefits helped Houston beat outmetropolitan Washington, southern California and Colorado for thefacility, Ms. Reed said.   Grumman had hoped to land the main contract for the Freedomspace station, but stayed in Houston when it failed, and now is asubcontractor on the project, working on the crew quarters and a``space tug.''   McDonnell-Douglas also set up shop in Houston a few years tosupply parts for the Freedom space station.   Brock said Houston is hoping to land an aircraft maintenancebase being planned by Continental Airlines Inc.   Houston also is home to Space Services Inc., which earlier thismonth sent its second commercially launched rocket into space andplans to launch 12 more this year. SSI is headed by Donald K.``Deke'' Slayton, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts.   ``The Fortune 500 20 years from now is going to have a number ofcompanies that do business in space,'' said Art Dula, aself-described ``space lawyer'' who has helped incorporate severalspace-related businesses including SSI.   ``Houston, since it has a very strong energy industry _ which ishigh-tech and Randamp;D (research and development) oriented _ has thekind of technical expertise'' to be home to those companies, someof which have yet to be founded, he said.   While the oil collapse pitched many workers out of a job, Brockand Dula said their skills _ from sheet metal working to computerprogramming _ easily can be used in the aerospace industry.   ``And as a result, we are trying to take the Johnson SpaceCenter and the activities based there and let that whole industryblossom,'' he said.   NASA pitched in three years ago as it helped establish a programcalled Partners In Space to aid companies in learning how to dobusiness with the space agency and benefit from its presence.   ``Partners ... believe that the center must be integrated intothe business, educational, research and technology goal of thestate,'' states a Partners publication. ``As such, Partners work intheir respective communities to ensure that America's spaceprogram, and especially the portion that could come to Texas,enjoys broad support.''   Houston's plans could be undermined, however, by problems withTexas's educational system.   At a recent symposium sponsored by Partners in Space, everyspeaker worried about those shortcomings.   ``Space travel and technology ... is a highly sophisticatedbusiness,'' said Thomas M. Stauffer, president of the University ofHouston-Clear Lake. ``It requires, indeed demands, a significantfraction of the nation's technical manpower in order for the spaceshuttle to fulfill its mission.   ``With the upcoming space station project, moon and Marsmissions, that fraction will grow,'' he said. ``The perfect U.S.space program is dependent upon a steady supply of highly educatedindividuals.''   But Stauffer and others said the Texas schools are not producingenough of those individuals. Arguments over court-ordered educationfunding show ``education leadership does not appear to be high onthe agenda in Austin,'' the state capital, he said.   While recruiters have focused on aerospace, Daniel Nebrig, anassociate director of the center, says future space explorationsmean more than just a one-industry impact.   Projects such as the space shuttle and the space station requirespecialized knowledge best found at NASA, Nebrig said.   But to figure out how to live on the Moon, or mine Mars, Nebrigsaid, ``We need new technology. ... We need people who are used tomaking concrete, mining, agriculture.''   ``Houston plays into that hand very well,'' Brock said.``Somewhere we will be involved with, if not space exploration,then space engineering as it continues to advance.''</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for Sunday May 20</NOTE></DOC>
