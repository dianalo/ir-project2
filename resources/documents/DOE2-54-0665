The structureis discussed in terms of the structure factor and the radial distributionfunction. The radial distribution function measures the coordinationaround an average atom; however, combined with other sources of informationthe nearest-neighbor coordination of the constituent atoms has been determined.Isotopic {sup 107}Ag substitution was used to identify the Ag correlations.Results are compared with earlier results for GeSe{sub 2} glass. 7 refs.,4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
