Quantities of more than onepound per run have been produced. The rate of erosion of various ceramicand refractory metal materials utilized for nozzle construction willbe described. Rapidly solidified ribbon had a uniform thickness and microstructure,with a cooling rate estimated at 10 to the 6th C/sec. Some melt spuntitanium alloys had a columnar grain structure with 2-5 micron grainsgrowing from the contact surface to the free surface. Other heavily segregatingalloys developed a two-zone microstructure consisting of columnar grainson the contact surface half of the ribbon, and equiaxed dendritic structureon the free surface half. 15 references.</TEXT></DOC>
