As a result, proposed standards are being prepared for WhiteHouse approval that would allow greater use of personal respiratorsfor short-term exposure to toxic substances or when the cost of acleanup is considered ``excessive,'' scientists with theOccupational Safety and Health Administration testified.   The changes were first advocated five years ago by the TaskForce on Regulatory Relief chaired by Bush and were pushed by thevice president in a meeting last month with officials of the LaborDepartment, the scientists said.   Dr. Sheldon W. Weiner, deputy director of health standards forOSHA, and John Martonik, the agency's director of standardsanalysis, said OSHA had effectively resisted the idea until January.   ``There is no way in my view that respirators can be asprotective,'' Weiner said.   Martonik agreed with that assessment but said the proposedregulations, nontheless, were sent to the White House with thechanges called for by Bush's task force.   ``It was a waste of our time as far as I`m concerned,'' Martoniktold the Senate Labor Committee. ``We had to tie up five yearsworking on this.''   The committee was told Monday that between 50,000 and 70,000Americans are dying from occupational illnesses each year becausethe Reagan administration has delayed new job health regulationsand has not enforced existing standards.   Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of environmental andoccupational medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City,offered those statistics Monday and estimated another 350,000workers incur illnesses each year because of inaction by theOccupational Safety and Health Administration.   John Moran, former director of safety research at the NationalInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health, said 2,000 workershave been killed in so-called ``confined space'' accidents alonesince 1980, when government safety officials first proposed aregulation to address the problem.   ``The proposed standard has never left the Department ofLabor,'' Moran told the Senate Labor Committee, which opened threedays of hearings into what Chairman Edward M. Kennedy called ``thefiddling away of workers' lives'' by the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration.   The confined space regulation recommended by OSHA safety expertsin 1980 was intended to address the high incidence of workers whoare electrocuted or otherwise killed or injured because there isnot enough room to maneuver around dangerous equipment.   Kennedy, D-Mass., vowed to develop a hearing record this weekshowing that ``the decision to let workers die while waiting on astandard or an inspection has been carried out by the highestlevels of this administration.''   Assistant Labor Secretary and OSHA Administrator JohnPendergrass is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the panel,which has had its staff investigating the agency for more than ayear.   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, called the figures ofLandrigan and Moran ``amazing numbers'' and said agency officialswould have no further comment until they appear before Kennedy'scommittee on Wednesday.   Landrigan testified Monday that occupational exposures to toxicsubstances _ ``almost all of them arising out of manmade conditionsand therefore preventable'' _ are raising mortality rates forcertain forms of cancer.   As an example, he said OSHA's decision not to reduce allowableexposures to benzene until 1987 will result in 19 to 65 leukemiadeaths that otherwise would not occur. He said the agency had thescientific evidence in 1981 to justify the reduction.   Another seven to 48 workers will develop cancer and at least5,900 more will contract respiratory ailments because OSHA delayedfor five years recommended reductions in formaldehyde exposures,Landrigan said.</TEXT></DOC>
