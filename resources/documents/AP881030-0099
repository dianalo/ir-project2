The accord, approved after six years of negotiations, will allowOPIC to compensate American investors for losses caused bypolitical crises, the officials said.   The U.A.E., a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, was thefifth of the GCC members to sign the accord after Saudi Arabia,Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Kuwait, the sixth GCC member, also wasexpected to sign a similar agreement.   The accord was negotiated by Robert C. O'Sullivan, assistantgeneral counsel for claims at OPIC, and Donald A. Roberts, thefirst secretary for economics at the American embassy in Abu Dhabi.   ``Such an agreement will break the psychological barrierpreventing American investors from operating in the U.A.E.,''O'Sullivan told The Associated Press. ``This is a proof of thefriendly relations between the U.S. and the U.A.E.''   Since 1971, OPIC has served as the key U.S. agency forencouraging American business investment in developing countriesthrough providing American investors with insurance against certainpolitical risks, loan guarantees, direct loans to small businessand cooperatives and a variety of pre-investment programs.   ``All these are designed to reduce the perceived stumbling risksand blocks associated with overseas investment,'' O'Sullivan said.   In the past 17 years, OPIC has settled about 215 insuranceclaims totalling $465 million. Its premiums are based on the natureof the investors' undertaking and the risk profile of the project,not on the country where the investment is launched, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
