The Drexel investigation, begun in the fall of 1986, represents the SEC's &quot;largest commitment of resources ever,&quot; according to the agency. It eclipses such major investigations as the insider-trading case against onetime arbitrager Ivan Boesky in 1986 and the fraud case against financier Robert Vesco in the early 1970s.    Although the agency wouldn't say how many SEC staffers were involved in the Drexel matter, the complaint offers one clue: The names of 21 SEC attorneys are listed on it. They were assisted by numerous other staffers, including investigators and accountants.    For Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement director, the Drexel case is a personal triumph. The mild-mannered graduate of Duke Law School joined the agency in 1976 and became the leader of former SEC Chairman John Shad's campaign against insider training.    With yesterday's action, Mr. Lynch, 37 years old, and his young enforcement staff have dispelled any lingering doubts about the SEC's willingness to go after the kingpins of Wall Street.    As for the sweep of the fraud allegations detailed in the complaint, &quot;this one may just break the mold,&quot; said SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue.    The complaint itself is 184 pages long. &quot;It's one of the longest complaints I've ever seen,&quot; said Harvey Pitt, the securities lawyer who represented Mr. Boesky.
