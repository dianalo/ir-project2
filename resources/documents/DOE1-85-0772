This ERMstopping rule directs more counting effort than is necessary towardsconcentrations well below present control limits for asbestos fibres.A preliminary investigation confirmed that alternative stopping rulescould be devised to give comparable results to the ERM rule, while yieldingsubstantial savings in evaluation time for low-density slides. Theirapplicability, however, was limited to a single control limit value andspecific sampling conditions. This report describes an extension to thestudy to identify and validate a more-robust candidate stopping ruleof generally wider applicability.</TEXT></DOC>
