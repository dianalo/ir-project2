The EuropeanCommunity agreed to make double-zero the access code for allinternational telephone calls. That code now is used in sixof the 12 member states.   The switch from six other codes for France, Britain, theNetherlands, Spain, Denmark and Ireland will occur by 1998.   Also with the planned single market in mind, ECtelecommunications ministers agreed in principle to break upstate satellite communications monopolies. The EC Commissionwill propose to abolish national rules that stiflepan-European satellite communications growth, and work on alicensing system for networks and on uniform technicalstandards. This could open business opportunities to providehardware and services for global voice and data networks.   Ministers also approved an EC directive that aims toremove national restrictions on use of leased telephonelines, a first step to open up public phone networks. Butthey made little progress on high-definition television,despite consensus on the need for EC-wide standards.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA DROPS AUTO QUOTAS                                                                                                          Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said foreignauto makers can export as many cars as they want toArgentina. When President Carlos Saul Menem ended importquotas last week, it wasn't clear whether the action appliedto cars. Argentina had protected auto production from foreigncompetition by imposing quotas and high tariffs for fourdecades. Under the deregulation, quotas can't exist, Mr.Cavallo said. This year's quota was 10,000 cars from Braziland about 4,500 from the rest of the world.                                                                                                          AUSTRIA FREES CAPITAL MOVES                                                                                                          Austria lifted its last restrictions on capital movements,completing a gradual process begun in 1986. Now Austrians canopen accounts and borrow abroad. They also can buy stocks andbonds without having to deposit them in Austrian banks.Foreigners can issue bonds and borrow money in Austriawithout being subjected to checks or intervention by thecountry's central bank.                                                                                                          CAMBODIA SELLS OFF ENTERPRISES                                                                                                          Phnom Penh has sold or leased 22 state factories andenterprises to foreign businesses. Among the operations soldwere a dairy, distillery and oil storage plant, and threeengineering workshops. K.C.G. Sin, an association of Khmerresidents in the U.S., leased a sawmill, brickworks andmechanical workshop. Other leased enterprises includetextile, soft-drink, shoe and plywood factories.                                                                                                          CUBA TO ALLOW FOREIGN CAPITAL                                                                                                          Cuban President Fidel Castro told businessmen from 26countries at a Mexican trade fair that the financiallydistressed island would open wide to foreign investment. Hesaid investment profits could be taken out of the country.Meanwhile, citing worsening shortages of fuel, electricityand spare parts, Havana said it would further curtail itstransportation system with new reductions of train servicesand the restriction of long-distance bus and truck travel todaylight hours.                                                                                                          ROMANIAN ARMY TO AID FARMERS                                                                                                          Romania called on the army to help reorganize the farmsector, which hasn't completed this year's harvest. After theDecember 1989 overthrow of the Ceausescu dictatorship, thegovernment pledged that soldiers no longer would be used fornonmilitary activities. But troops now are to help sow cropsand distribute farm machinery and fuel. Romania also issetting up commissions to issue land titles under a lawreturning property seized during the Ceausescu years.                                                                                                          OIL-SPILL SYSTEM EXTENDED                                                                                                          Two trade groups representing shipping and oil concernsagreed to extend for two years to February 1994 a voluntarycompensation system providing as much as $135 million toclean up oil spills caused by participating members.   The accord applies world-wide and its subscribersrepresent about 97% of world tanker tonnage, making anuninsured spill less likely, said a spokesman for the TankerOwners Voluntary Agreement Concerning Liability for OilPollution. The second group is named Contract Regarding aSupplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution.   Under the system, shippers or oil concerns are stillliable for oil-spill damages in excess of the maximumcoverage provided by the industry umbrella. But the pactassures &quot;timely compensation to those affected by oil spillsfrom tankers, regardless of fault,&quot; said Tanker Owners.   The agreement is designed to overlap spill coverage by twointernational conventions that establish insurance pools forspill cleanups while setting limits on liability of tankerowners or operators. But only 66 of about 150 maritimenations have ratified those 20-year-old protocols.
