The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,ruled on Monday that college scholarships set aside tocorrect past discrimination are unconstitutional without &quot;aspecific finding&quot; that discrimination at the institutionstill persists.</LP><TEXT>   The opinion opens the door to legal challenges in at least19 states where universities have set up race-basedscholarships as part of negotiated settlements with the U.S.Department of Education to end decades of pastdiscrimination.   The decision stunned education experts familiar with theUniversity of Maryland, which they say has a well-documentedrecord of the lingering effects of past discrimination. &quot;I'malmost floored,&quot; said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel forthe American Council on Education in Washington. &quot;I thinkmany individuals in higher education felt that one of thestrongest cases for race-based scholarships was the factpattern presented in the Maryland case.&quot;   Lawyers involved in the case said the decision, iffollowed by other appeals courts, has the potential to wipeout race-based scholarship programs nationwide, mostly atstate universities and particularly in the South. For now,the decision is binding only within the Fourth CircuitCourt's territory, which comprises Maryland, North Carolina,South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.   The decision didn't specify what would constitute aspecific finding of discrimination sufficient to justifyrace-based scholarships. &quot;Maryland made all the argumentsthat are traditionally made in support of such programs,&quot;said Richard Samp, general counsel for the Washington LegalFoundation, a business interest group in Washington thatbrought the suit on behalf of a Hispanic plaintiff, Dennis J.Podberesky. &quot;I don't know what more they could have come upwith.&quot;   Race-based scholarship programs designed to correct pastdiscrimination have been required by the federal governmentfor more than two decades as a condition for federaleducation funding. The Bush administration, critical of allracial quotas, considered opposing race-based scholarships onconstitutional grounds in 1990, but backed down due to publicopposition.   Instead, last December, the Department of Education issuedproposed guidelines declaring race-based scholarships legalupon &quot;a proper finding&quot; by a court or administrative bodythat they are needed to remedy past discrimination.   The court's opinion Monday, however, goes further than theproposed regulation, effectively throwing into question whatlevel of evidence of discrimination is needed before theEducation Department can require race-based scholarships. Adepartment spokesman said only that the appeals court opinionis being reviewed.   The Maryland case concerned Mr. Podberesky, fromRandallstown, Md., who got close to straight A's in highschool, scored well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test andworked for Amnesty International in his spare time. Mr.Podberesky was admitted to the university's College Parkbranch in 1989. But when he applied for a Benjamin BannekerScholarship, he was turned down because he is Hispanic.   The Banneker scholarship, reserved for blacks, was part ofa number of remedial efforts begun by Maryland after federalofficials notified the state in 1969 that the 99%-whiteenrollment record at the university was unconstitutional.   Since 1969, Maryland has worked to comply with guidelinesset by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights,eventually reaching a 14% enrollment goal for black freshmenin 1989. But other enrollment and graduation goals for blackswere left unmet, and the office of civil rights wascontinuing its oversight when Mr. Podberesky filed his suit.   The fact that the federal government continues to monitorthe university was the best argument that racism persists atMaryland, said Andrew Baida, a Maryland deputy attorneygeneral, who represented the university. But the FourthCircuit disagreed, sending the case back to the lower courtfor &quot;a determination as to the present effects of pastdiscrimination.&quot; No decision has been made on whether toappeal the ruling.   The decision is patterned after a U.S. Supreme Courtruling in January 1989 that sharply limited the power ofstate and local governments to adopt affirmative-action plansin awarding public contracts.   In that case, a Richmond plan requiring that 30% of thework on all city construction contracts be awarded tominority subcontractors was struck down. The law was intendedto redress Richmond's history of discrimination, but thecourt said it was unconstitutional because the city didn'tpoint to any identifiable racism still continuing in thecity's construction industry.</TEXT></DOC>
