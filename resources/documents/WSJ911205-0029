Yet the huge portrait, and the Iraqigunboats in dry dock nearby, lie inside Kuwait.   Or do they?</LP><TEXT>   To the west, Iraqi guards man border posts on the Kuwaitiside of the line. At least that's what the map says. Theproblem is, the same map bears a qualifier: &quot;Border alignmentapproximate.&quot;   When President Bush said he was drawing &quot;a line in thesand&quot; last year, he probably didn't have survey teams inmind. But since allied troops have won the war, it is UnitedNations map makers who must secure the peace. Their task isto plot the unmarked border between Iraq and Kuwait that wasa spur and a pretext for Saddam Hussein's invasion last year.   But drawing the line will require both science and seance.The reason: a historical mystery involving a lost date palm,a missing signpost and a British agent who hiked into thedesert 70 years ago to a point no one can find anymore.   &quot;Memories fade, scenery changes, and people who couldanswer certain questions are dead,&quot; says Julian Walker, aBritish official and renowned border sleuth who is advisingthe U.N. team. &quot;One can't say with certainty where the lineis.&quot;   The same is true of borders across the Arabian peninsula.For centuries, tribes in this vast desert defined theirfrontiers with what diplomats call &quot;constructive ambiguity.&quot;Borders ebbed and flowed with the power and grazing patternsof neighboring nomads. It was only oil exploration, and thecompeting ambitions of colonial powers, that forced tribes todecide who owned precisely which dune -- and which barrel ofoil.   When the British asked the emir of Kuwait to define hisdomain in 1923, he said it extended &quot;along the batin&quot; (aravine) and &quot;to the south&quot; of several oases in Iraq.Officials in Baghdad agreed, and Maj. John More, a Britishagent, set out to mark this vaguely worded line.   At the Iraqi oasis of Safwan, he located themost-southerly palm tree and paced south through the sand forabout 1,000 yards. There, he erected a wooden sign that read:&quot;Iraq-Kuwait Boundary.&quot;   Sometime later, the signpost vanished. When officialsreturned to put it up again, they found new palm grovesstretching far south of Safwan. No one could say for surewhere the original border lay. Nearby oil fields, anddisputed sea access at the border's eastern end, deepened thedebate. In 1963, after Iraq threatened to invade, the twocountries formalized the fuzzy frontier set out in earlierdecades, but Baghdad refused to demarcate it. This left thedoor open to the liberal interpretation of the two states'territory that Saddam Hussein provided with his tanks lastyear.   Now, the border area is a 9.3-mile-wide demilitarizedzone, monitored by U.N. forces. Swooping over the DMZ in ahelicopter, Capt. Bill Bonner gazes out at sand, sand andmore sand. &quot;I can tell you Iraq's to the north and Kuwait'sto the south,&quot; says the Canadian, an officer with the U.N.&quot;But there's no magic line through those dunes.&quot;   The unmarked border frustrates the 300 U.N. observers, whomust report crossings of the &quot;approximate&quot; line marked ontheir maps. In August, Iraqi police fired on Kuwaiti police,and a U.N. official tried to arbitrate. &quot;Not one of the threeparties could say what country they were in,&quot; says Maj. Gen.Gunther Greindl, the U.N.'s chief military observer. Kuwaitislater arrested Iraqi farmers near Safwan who, it seems, hadbeen tilling Kuwaiti soil for years. Iraq also occupies fivepolice posts on the Kuwaiti side of the U.N. map, but refusesto budge until the border is made final.   That is where the Iraq/Kuwait Boundary DemarcationCommission comes in. Technically, the U.N. team's job isstraightforward. There are few terrain features here to blocksurvey sightings, and even fewer clouds to obstruct aerialphotography. Satellites enable surveyors to sketch a linebetween two points that is accurate within two centimeters.   But the conundrum remains: what points? For this,surveyors must turn again to the vague documents of earlierdecades, much as the U.S. Supreme Court tries to interpretthe original intent of the Constitution. &quot;We have to take ageneral description and make it specific,&quot; explains MiklosPinther, the U.N.'s chief cartographer. &quot;What does the term`just south of' mean? Or `along the batin?'&quot;   Mr. Walker, the British border expert, is one man theboundary commission has called on for answers. As a diplomatin the 1960s, he helped map the United Arab Emirates, acrazy-quilt confederation of seven sheikdoms, some of whichown pockets wholly inside another's borders. Now, at 62, Mr.Walker has returned to the field. &quot;One must try,&quot; he says,&quot;to imagine what the old world looked like.&quot;   To do this, he visited Safwan and sought elderly guideswho could describe the town's layout when it was just a fewhuts and trees. Their stories, and records from Indiansurveyors in the 1930s, led to the remains of a customsbuilding often referred to in earlier records. This couldprovide a reference point from which to roughly ascertainwhere the missing signpost stood.   But the surveyors won't try to locate the spot on foot.&quot;One doesn't want to scramble around in the open,&quot; Mr. Walkerexplains. &quot;Too many explosives.&quot; The surveyors already havesurvived one close call, when their helicopter touched downbeside a land mine.   The findings of the commission also could prove explosive,so it is working in virtual secrecy and won't go public untilFebruary. A visit to the border port of Umm Qasr helpsexplain why. Desperate for clear sea access, Baghdad has,over the past 20 years, gradually extended Umm Qasr south,apparently nibbling at vacant Kuwaiti land. Iraqi docks,homes and Saddam Hussein placards now spill almost a milesouth of Iraq's own border post.   Diplomats familiar with the U.N. survey say that much ofUmm Qasr, including its huge naval base, will be returned toKuwait. So may several oil wells in the disputed Rumaillahfield. But some experts warn that such an adjustment -- whichIraq, with only one vote on the commission, can't prevent --could sow the seeds for future conflict.   &quot;The age-old problem of Iraqi access to the Gulf remains,&quot;says Richard Schofield, deputy director of the Geopoliticsand International Boundaries Research Center in London. &quot;Iraqnever felt able to live with this, and may not in thefuture.&quot;   If trouble ever does flare again, Kuwait, at least, willbe better prepared. Once the border is marked with concretepillars, Kuwait plans to add a 124-mile-long fence equippedwith sensors that will alert the Kuwaitis to any intruders.   But border shifts and state-of-the-art barriers won'tallay the fears of some jittery Kuwaitis. Customs officerKhalid Abdullah was taken prisoner when Iraq stormed acrossthe border near Safwan last year. He is back at work now, butwith border traffic limited to Palestinians and statelessArabs deported by Kuwait, he doesn't have much to do, exceptwatch television. Unfortunately for Mr. Abdullah, Kuwaiti TVdoesn't yet reach here, but Baghdad TV does.   &quot;Saddam is coming again, for sure,&quot; Mr. Abdullah says,after watching the Iraqi leader pin medals on his Gulf Wargenerals. Asked what would make him secure, he adds: &quot;A wall,a very big wall. Like the one in China.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
