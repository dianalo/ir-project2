But a faster-than-expected increase in imports was offset by a continued rapid export expansion that heightened concerns about the difficulty of further reducing the imbalance.    The trade surplus contracted 4.1% to $4.94 billion in August from $5.15 billion the year before, the Ministry of Finance said. Imports jumped 27% to $15.86 billion from $12.46 billion, and exports rose 18% to $20.8 billion from $17.6 billion.    After seasonal adjustment, the surplus declined 11% in August to $5.53 billion from $6.22 billion in July. Seasonally adjusted imports gained 6.4% to $16.83 billion from $15.82 billion, while exports rose 1.5% to $22.37 billion from $22.04 billion.    The U.S. continued to make solid gains in its trade with Japan. Japan's bilateral surplus eased 13% to $3.25 billion in August from $3.73 billion the year before. Imports from the U.S. continued their strong performance of past months, leaping 39% to $3.72 billion, while Japanese exports rose only 9% to $6.97 billion. American food exports showed particular strength, rising 72.5% to $1.12 billion.    Japan's global surplus had widened in July, the first increase since early 1987, and this led many economists to speculate that Japan's effort to ease its reliance on exports was facing serious obstacles. Last month's turnaround may have shown those fears to be somewhat premature, but policy makers bent on squeezing the surplus even more are likely to find the size of the export surge troubling.    Nevertheless, analysts considered August's import data heartening. &quot;The single most important event shown by these statistics is that there has been a major reacceleration in the growth of underlying imports&quot; following five months of slowing growth, said David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley International Ltd. Underlying imports cover all products except gold and mineral fuels.    Mr. Gerstenhaber said the value of underlying imports rose 45% year to year in August compared with 27% growth in July. In volume terms, meanwhile, imports in August grew at a 17% year-to-year pace, faster than July's 16% rate, but slower than earlier months this year.    Some of the strongest growth in imports came in the food category, which increased 47% to $2.83 billion from August 1987. Purchases of seafood leaped 55% to $1.26 billion. Other products that witnessed strong growth were office equipment, up 54% to $293.3 million, and semiconductors and related electronic equipment, up 67% to $217.6 million.    David Pike, an economist with UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew, said the strong imports provided &quot;evidence of continued strong growth in domestic demand&quot; in the Japanese economy. This strengthens the view that the economy has resumed solid growth in the current quarter after the second quarter's sluggish performance.    Continued growth in domestic demand is essential for Japan's policy of reducing its trade surplus, Mr. Pike added, particularly in the face of the consistent rise in exports. &quot;We need to see continued strong growth of domestic economic activity if we are not going to see some reversal of the trade-adjustment process,&quot; he said.    In August, export volume rose at a 6.8% pace, higher than July's 5.9% rate and the highest rate since before the trade surplus began to decline. As has been the case for several months, the strongest growth came in capital goods and electrical machinery. General machinery shipments rose 28% to $4.44 billion, while electrical products gained 27% to $5.06 billion. Capital-goods exports primarily reflect capital investment in the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia, a trend that is boosted by extensive Japanese expenditures on factories and other facilities overseas.    The consistently high growth of exports is what worries government officials and analysts alike. Japan has experienced a &quot;lopsided trade-adjustment process,&quot; Mr. Pike of UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew said. &quot;It has been successful only because Japanese domestic demand growth has been extremely high.&quot; While the decline in the trade surplus appears sustainable over the short term, he said, a slowing in domestic growth may change that picture by early 1989. &quot;Then worries over trade adjustment are going to come back to the fore.&quot;    Mr. Gerstenhaber of Morgan Stanley, however, suggested any decline in growth in Japan could be accompanied by a parallel slowdown in its major markets, which would affect Japanese exports of both capital goods and consumer products.    Exports surged to Europe and Asia as well as to the U.S. Shipments to the European Community rose 30% to $3.59 billion, while exports to South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India -- a separate statistical category -- increased 28% to $5.5 billion. Exports to the six countries comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were up 34% to $1.72 billion.    Imports from the EC jumped 46% to $2.07 billion, but that was distorted by shifting currency values in the past year. Imports from the four Asian countries gained 28% to $4.05 billion. The largest single-country increase was with South Korea, where imports were up 67% to $1.04 billion in August. Imports from the Asian nations rose 10.1% to $1.84 billion.    The shrinkage of the August trade deficit was good news for the Japanese government. Under prodding from its major trading partners, especially the U.S., Tokyo has been taking measures to stimulate the Japanese economy in order to draw in more imports.    The widening of the surplus in July, though accepted fairly calmly by the markets, sent a warning signal to government planners. A repeat performance would be &quot;a bad thing for us from a policy point of view,&quot; a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said in a recent interview.    ---   Damon Darlin contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
