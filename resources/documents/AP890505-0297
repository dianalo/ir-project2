On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed at$20.02 a barrel, 56 cents lower than Thursday's session. Thecontract traded as low as $19.99 but rose shortly before the close,traders said.   Other crude contracts also closed the day lower.   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for June delivery fell2.12 cents to 67.50 cents a gallon, while June heating oil declined1.22 cents to settle at 47.37 cents a gallon.
