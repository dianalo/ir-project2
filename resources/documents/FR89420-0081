This program isdirected to support projects to demonstrate the effectiveness, safety,and acceptability of isoniazid (NIH) therapy in preventing clinical tuberculosisamong intravenous drug users (IVDU) and other groups with a high prevalenceof tuberculous infection who are also at high risk of having HIV infectionand who are enrolled in methadone treatment programs or other long-termhealth care systems which are designed to provide long-term (at least 6to 12 months) follow-up.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority</ITAG>These cooperative agreements are authorized by the Public Health ServiceAct: section 301(a) (U.S.C. 241(a)), as amended; and section 317(a) (42U.S.C. 247b(a)). Regulations governing programs for preventive health servicesare codified at 42 CFR Part 51b. Subpart A contains general provisionsrelating to these programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Eligible applicants for this program are the official public health agenciesof State and local governments currently receiving cooperative agreementfunds for TB Control and/or TB/HIV Activities. Current TB Control cooperativeagreement recipients are located in areas accounting for 97% of the TBcases reported in the United States during 1987 and 98% of the AIDS casesreported through December 5, 1988. Since limited funds are available, thoseareas which have significant levels of morbidity and infection with bothconditions will be given priority.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds</ITAG>Approximately $3,300,000 is available in Fiscal Year 1989 to fund approximately30 projects. Awards are expected to range from $30,000 to $150,000 withan average award of $100,000. It is expected that the awards will beginon August 1, 1989, for a 12-month budget period within a project periodof up to 4 years. These awards will be consolidated into the TB Controland TB and HIV Activities awards. Continuation awards within the projectperiod will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availabilityof funds.Cooperative agreement funds may be used to support personnel and to purchaseequipment, supplies, and services directly related to project activities.Under section 317 of the PHS Act, direct assistance (``in lieu of cash'')may be requested. Funds may not be used to supplant State or local fundsor for inpatient care.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>The propose of this program is to demonstrate acceptability, safety, andprogrammatic effectiveness of INH therapy in preventing clinical TB amongIVDU and other groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection whoare also at high risk of HIV infection. This program will address the problem of increasing HIV-related TB by ensuringthat funded drug treatment programs or other health care programs employinterventions leading to achievement of the following national objectives:A. At least 95% of all new clients and other already enrolled will receivea Mantoux tuberculin skin test using 5 tuberculin units of purified proteinderivative (PPD) with results recorded in millimeters (mm) of induration,unless this test has been previously performed and documented. All enrolleeswill be tested initially, and subsequent enrollees will be tested within2 weeks of enrolling in the program;B. At least 95% of all clients with a 5mm or larger tuberculin skin testwill be clinically evaluated for TB within 2 weeks of the skin test reading;C. Regardless of age, at least 90% of all HIV-positive clients with a 5mmor larger induration and 90% of all HIV-negative (or HIV status unknown)IVDU clients with 10mm or more induration will be placed on INH preventivetherapy if there is no evidence of clinical TB or medical contraindications;and D. At least 80% of all clients started on treatment and who continue inthe program will complete the recommended 6 months of directly observedINH preventive therapy if the HIV serostatus in negative or unknown and12 months if the HIV is seropositive. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Requirements</ITAG>A. <T3>Recipient Activities</T3>1. Arrange for on site Mantoux tuberculin skin testing and recoding ofresults in millimeters of induration for (a) IVDU enrolled in drug treatmentprograms and/or (b) other individuals who are at high risk of having bothtuberculous and HIV infection and who are enrolled in health care programswhich are designed to provide long-term (at least 6 to 12 months) follow-up.2. Provide pre-test counseling about the skin test and the need for follow-upand preventive therapy if the skin test is positive.3. Routinely offer culturally sensitive and language specific pre- andpost-test counseling and voluntary HIV antibody testing to all adults withtuberculosis. Persons with positive tuberculn skin test reactions shouldbe routinely assessed for HIV risk factors and if persent should be offeredcounseling and HIV antibody testing. 4. In collaboration with the HIV/AIDS prevention programs, establish standardsand implement procedures for confidential notification of sex and needle-sharingpartners of persons with AIDS and HIV infection. These should emphasizethe role of the seropositive person in informing partners; train seropositivepersons in techniques of notifying partners; and, where appropriate, offerhealth departments assistance in confidentially notifying partners.5. Ensure that clients with a 5mm or larger tuberculin skin test reactionare evaluated for clinical TB and, if present, treated according to currentguidelines. Persons with symptoms suggestive of TB will be referred forevaluation regardless of the skin test reaction. 6. Ensure that clients with a positive skin test and no clinical evidenceof TB or medical contraindications are started on INH preventive therapyand ensure that 6 to 12 months of uninterrupted daily or biweekly preventivetherapy are provided. This will include all HIV-seropositive persons witha 5mm or larger skin test reaction and all HIV-seronegative (or HIV statusunknown) with a 10mm or larger induration. An aggressive ``case management''approach must be employed to ensure therapy compliance. While on preventivetherapy, clients will be monitored at least monthly for compliance andsigns and symptoms of possible adverse drug reactions.7. Provide follow-up for clients who fail to comply with their preventivetherapy regimens.8. Develop a collaborative plan between the State/local health departmentand the drug treatment or other health programs which will be providingthese services. The roles of the two agencies should be specifically definedand letters of support from the other participating health program(s) shouldbe included. The plan should also specify how the confidentiality of patientrecords will be ensured and should include documentation which permitsthe use of and reporting of the HIV antibody test results for the purposesdescribed in the application.9. Determine by HIV status the number of TB cases identified during initialscreening procedures, the number occurring during preventive therapy, andthe number occurring during the 2-year period following preventive therapy.B. <T3>Centers for Disease Control Activities</T3>1. Assist in the development of appropriate counseling messages and inthe training of staff.2. Assist in implementing public health and medical policies and recommendationsrelated to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HIV-related TB.3. Assist in developing data collection instruments and in the analysisand interpretation of data to evaluate HIV-related TB prevention activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review and Evaluation Criteria</ITAG>Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the followingcriteria:A. The degree of need for support to prevent HIV-related tuberculosis;B. The extent of HIV-related TB problems;C. The degree to which long- and short-term objectives are consistent withthe national goal and objectives and are realistic, specific, measurable,and consistent with availability of funds.D.
