Robert</NOTE><BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush exhortedRepublican platform writers Monday to make GOP policies clear,including an ironclad commitment against a tax increase, ratherthan turn out a ``document of deceit'' as he said the Democrats haddone.   Bush said the Republican platform must offer American voters ``aplan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise inevasion.''   He journeyed here from his vacation home in Kennebunkport,Maine, to put his personal stamp on the platform that the106-member committee will draft this week and present to theRepublican National Convention next Tuesday.   Committee members cheered when he depicted Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis as ``the stealth candidate'' whose ``policies areinvisible.''   He said Dukakis' declaration in his acceptance speech that thisis an election ``about competence, not ideology,'' was merely ``anattempt to convince America that ideas don't matter.''   ``Our campaign will be different because ideas do matter,'' saidBush, adding that voters must choose between ``two entire sets ofvalues.''   ``I will not raise your taxes, period, and I hope the plaformwill say the same thing,'' he said. ``I believe that the way to cutthe federal deficit is to rein in spending, not by rounding up moretaxes.''   On other issues, he made a pitch for his proposed $2.2 billionchild-care tax credit for low-income families, and pledged toughenforcement of fair trade laws.   He went over many other campaign stands, including his calls fortax-free college savings bonds, a ban on ocean dumping of sludgeand imposition of the death penalty for narcotics kingpins andkillers of police.   Bush promised ``faster action to clean up toxic waste (and) atougher line on acid rain.''   He repeated his pledge ``to develop and deploy a strategicdefense system as soon as possible,'' and he accused Dukakis ofbeing ``silent at best and unsteady at worst'' on arms control andforeign policy issues.   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the chairman of the platform committee,hailed Bush as ``a champion of traditional values.''   She said that ``vague generalities in the Democratic platformare going to cost the taxpayer close to $45 billion in 1989.''   Orr, speaking with reporters, provided no specifics but saidthat was the preliminary estimate of Republican analysts who havetaken a close look at both the Democratic platform and Dukakis'campaign promises.   Her committee spent most of the day divided into sevensubcommittees, hearing testimony from more than 200 witnesses,including Contra leader Adolfo Calero, anti-ERA activist PhyllisSchlafly and Edward Teller, the H-bomb inventor and father of theStrategic Defense Initiative.   The 1988 GOP platform was expected to hew closely to theanti-tax and anti-abortion lines of the party's 1984 platform, withnew or reworded planks on such emergent issues as AIDS, drugs,education and child care.   Calero urged ``the party of Lincoln'' to renew its pledge ofsupport for the Nicaraguan rebels.   He told reporters Dukakis, an adamant opponent of Contra aid,``doesn't understand the Sandinistas apparently. He doesn'tunderstand the threat they represent. He doesn't understand thatthey are bent on ... expanding the revolution.''   In a subcommittee hearing on family and community, witnessesclashed over whether the party should change its traditionalconservative positions on such issues as child care and abortion.   Bill Hamilton, director of Planned Parenthood's Washingtonoffice, said a poll conducted by his organization showed that theparty's convention delegates ``disagree with many of the planks andwith the tone of your 1984 platform around family planning andother reproductive health questions.''   For instance, he said, the 400 delegates interviewed bytelephone in late June and early July by the Analysis Group of NewHaven, Conn., were evenly split on a constitutional amendmentagainst abortion and a majority believed abortion a private matterbetween a woman, her family and doctor.   But Kay James of the National Right to Life and the BlackAmericans for Life said that the right-to-privacy argument is ``thenew catchword for abortion.''   She and others urged the GOP to maintain its condemnation ofabortion.   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, one of the crafters of theGramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told the subcommittee on theeconomy, ``Half of the growth in federal revenues ought to go backto people who pull the wagon, who do the work, who pay the taxes.Democrats want people who ride in the wagon to get all the money sothey can watch Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson share the reins.''   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah told a family subcommittee that theDemocrats' $2.5 billion child-care bill ``would throw money fromthe top down, a Washington bureaucratic approach.''   Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, co-chairman of the platformcommittee, said in an interview, ``Generally speaking, I sensewe're not likely to revisit in great detail some of the debates wehad in '80 and '84 on ERA and abortion.''   The seven subcommittees will vote on proposed planks Tuesday,then the full panel will spend three days trying to put the entireplatform together.</TEXT></DOC>
