The Los Angeles River flowed over its concretebanks into the Sepulveda Dam Basin in Van Nuys, floodingnearby streets and nearly submerging dozens of automobiles inthe area. Helicopters and local firefighters were called into rescue motorists.   Still, major California insurance companies said the levelof damage reported so far by businesses and homeowners wasn'tmajor. Auto insurers said they expected costs associated withcar accidents and injuries, but didn't anticipate unusualclaims due to the rains.

In San Diego, the storms halted repair work ona sewage pipe that has been gushing partly treated sewageinto the ocean since earlier this month; work might notresume until next week, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
