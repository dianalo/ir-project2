In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it holds 1,654,589 of the Boston-based real estate investment trust's common shares. The stake includes 328,275 shares purchased last Thursday in a private transaction with certain Bay Financial holders for $31 each.    According to the filing, the group bought the additional shares &quot;for the purpose of increasing its investment in the company,&quot; but it doesn't currently intend to buy any more stock. The group also may seek additional representation on the company's board, the filing added. Country andamp; New Town Properties Chairman Gerald M. Newton was elected to Bay Financial's board last year.    As previously reported, preliminary merger discussions between Bay Financial and Commonwealth Realty Trust, an affiliate of the group, &quot;are not continuing at this time as a result of a failure to agree upon certain terms and conditions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
