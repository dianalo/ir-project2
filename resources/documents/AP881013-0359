Inc., nearly doubled over the sameperiod last year because of extraordinary costs related to Revco'sChapter 11 filing, the company reported Thursday.   Anac posted a $27.9 million net loss, greater than the $14million loss in the same three-month period last year.   The quarterly operating profit before depreciation andamortization was $6.1 million, compared with $31.3 million in thesame period last year, according to Gregory K. Raven, Revco'sexecutive vice president-finance and chief financial officer.   Anac had $583.7 million in sales for the quarter compared to$522.8 million in its first fiscal quarter of 1987.   Raven blamed the losses on ``extraordinary costs and temporarilylow inventory levels directly related to the company's failure tomake a subordinated debt interest payment on June 15, 1988, and itsvoluntary filing for Chapter 11 protection'' from creditors inbankruptcy court.   Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection on July 28, about a monthafter it failed to make an interest payment on about $700 millionin outstanding high-risk junk bonds used to finance its $1.5billion leveraged buyout in 1986.   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely throughborrowed funds repaid from a target company's profits or assetsales.   The Twinsburg-based company sought protection from creditorsafter talks with bondholders broke down, becoming the largestcompany involved in a leveraged buyout to take such action.   Revco operates nearly 2,000 drugs store in 27 states.</TEXT></DOC>
