Information-gathering is the basis of allother managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doingit.&quot;andP;  Clearly he believes that information gathering is a high-leverageactivity.andM;In his book Grove focuses on gathering information at the workplace; othersstress a more eclectic approach.andP;  I've commented before about the vast amountof virtually random information that Bill McGowan, MCI Communications Corp.'schairman and co-founder, believes he must absorb to do his job.andM;Tom Peters, management consultant and writer, describes his own methodologyfor absorbing and classifying huge amounts of information as &quot;the garbagemanstrategy.&quot;andM;There are a myriad of purposes for all this information gathering: to buildand test models of the real world; to identify potential courses of action orto get feedback on past decisions; to see how others view what is going on orwhat they expect will happen in the future.andM;With these thoughts in mind, I would like to mention a few things I have readrecently about the past year, the past decade and the past quarter-centurythat I have found interesting and potentially useful.andM;Feats of EngineeringandM;The National Academy of Engineering, in celebration of its 25th anniversary,has put together a list of the 10 greatest engineering achievements of thelast 25 years.andM;Five of these achievements are of particular interest to informationtechnologists: unmanned satellites, fiber-optic communications, themicroprocessor, lasers and computer-aided design and manufacturing.andM;This is a fascinating list.andP;  Ten years ago, the particality of fiber-optictelecommunications had more doubters than supporters.andM;In fact, the perceived relative importance of satellite telecommunicationsvs.andP;  fiber-optics has been reversed during only the last five years.andM;The impact of the microprocessor in the form of personal computers is a stillshorter-term phenomenon, and the emergence of laser printers and storagedevices as practical information processing devices is even more recent.andM;CAD/CAM, on the other hand, was in existence 25 years ago -- at least in aprimitive form.andP;  It has had a long gestation period.andP;  Yet, curiously, theacademy speaks of it in these terms; &quot;Hidden behind factory walls throughoutthe world, another industrial revolution is unfolding around the computer.andP;  .andO;.  .  .&quot;  Is it really a past achievement, or the promise of something stillin the future?andM;And that leads directly to an item that appeared in the Washington Posttitled &quot;The '80s: The More Things Change .andP;  .  .  .&quot;  This survey of economicprojections by Elizabeth Spayde suggests that economic changes do not happennearly as fast as economists would have us believe.andM;&quot;The looming service economy is still looming,&quot; Spayde says.andP;  Despite theforecasts of trend spotters, service jobs today account for 76 percent of thetotal work force, only 5 percentage points more than a decade ago.andP;  And themanufacturing sector of the economy still contributes 22 percent to 24percent of the real gross national product, as it has for the last 30 years.andM;Maybe it's not a contradiction after all.andP;  Maybe the changes forecasted willbecome a reality and what is needed is the recognition that for some things,10 years is not a very long time; for others, it's much too long.andM;And maybe technological innovation is a lot easier to accomplish thanobtaining the economic benefits of applying the technology.andM;I also find it fascinating that in 1989 two such diverse books as RobertFulghum's All I Really Need to Know Learned in Kindergarten and StephenHawking's A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes shouldeach have sold more than a million copies and still be on the best-sellerlists.andM;From Kindergarten to Black HolesandM;Fulghum's book is simplicity itself.andP;  Hawking's book may be the mostdifficult to understand that has ever reached the best-seller lists.andP;  Andthat is not because of Stephen Hawking's writing, which is eminent in itsclarity, but because of the richness of the material he covers.andM;However, it is such a contrast to Fulghum's book that its popularity can bedifficult to understand, not to mention what it possibly could have in commonwith a book that finds its source of wisdom in the realm of children.andM;The answer lies, I think, in this quotation from Carl Sagan's introduction toHawking's book: &quot;Except for children (who don't know enough to not ask theimportant questions), few of us spend much time wondering why nature is theway it is; where the cosmos came from, or whether it was always here; it timewill one day flow backward and effects precede causes; or whether there areultimate limits to what humans can know.andM;&quot;There are children, and I have met some of them, who want to know what ablack hole looks like; what is the smallest piece of matter, why we rememberthe past and not the future; how it is, if there was chaos early, that thereis, apparently, order today; and why there [is] a universe.&quot;andM;'Be Aware of Wonder'andM;The link?andP;  One of Fulghum's maxims is, &quot;Be aware of wonder.&quot;andP;  And wonder isoften the first stage in information-gathering of all sorts.andM;But for those of a more practical bent I have compiled an abbreviated list ofother maxims from Fulghum's book, oriented to the Washington community.andM;I call it, &quot;All You Really Need to Know About Ethics You Can Learn FromFulghum's Book.&quot;andP;  It goes like this:andM;* Share everything.andM;* Play fair.andM;* Don't hit people.andM;* Put things back where you found them.andM;* Clean up your own mess.andM;* Don't take things that aren't yours.andM;* Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.andM;* When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands and sticktogether.andM;Now isn't that a lot more useful than the Procurement Integrity Act?andM;It's really too bad some of us grow up and forget what we knew as children.andO;Maybe we need more books such as Fulghum's and Hawking's to remind us.andM;Frank Carr retired from the General Services Administration in 1988.andP;  Ascommissioner of GSA's Information Resources Management Service, he was thefederal government's top information technology procurement official.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
