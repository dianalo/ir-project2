But the report by the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration said not all of the increase can be attributed tospeed and higher death tolls in some states may be due to chancebecause the number of fatalities is so small.   The agency, in a report delivered to Congress on Monday, saidstates are in the best position to make decisions on posted speedlimits and enforcement.   ``The available data show that the number of rural Interstatefatalities and the rural Interstate fatality rate increased afterthe speed limit was raised to 65 mph,'' the report said.   It estimated that fatalities on rural highways increased 31percent from 1986, before the higher speed limit was allowed, to1988 in those states that raised the speed limit during 1987.   The agency estimated that one-third of the fatalities were dueto increased traffic on the highways and two-thirds to otherfactors, primarily greater speed.   The report is based on highway fatality data provided by the 40states that increased the speed limit on rural Interstates, whichCongress allowed beginning in 1987.   Deaths on Interstates totaled 2,836 in 1988, or about 6 percentof total fatalities. Interstate highways have a lower fatality rateper miles traveled than other roads.   Overall, traffic fatalities increased in 1988 by 1.5 percentover 1987, from 46,390 to 47,079, the highway safety agency said.But the fatality rate, which considers miles traveled, remainedstable at the 1987 rate of 2.4, which is the lowest in history, thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
