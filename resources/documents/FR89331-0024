Regulatory measures sometimes are necessary that cannot be implementedthrough normal procedures provided by the Magnuson Act for conservationand management of the groundfish resources. Section 305(e) of the MagnusonAct provides authority to the Secretary temporarily to amend fishery managementplans and implement measures that resolve fishery problems that the Secretarydetermines pose emergencies in the fishery. Under this section, the Secretarymay implement an emergency rule in response to recommendations made bythe Council or on his own authority. The Council has recommended certain changes in regulations that implementthe FMPs. The first recommendation is to change the general definitionsof directed fishing in regulations implementing the FMPs. These definitionsare found at 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 675. The second recommendationis to implement a change specific to the definition of directed fishingfor sablefish. Council recommendations and determinations by the Secretaryare explained as follows: 1. General Definitions of Directed fishing at 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and675Directed fishing is defined in regulations implementing both FMPs. Withone exception for the Gulf of Alaska FMP, directed fishing currently meansfishing that is intended or can be reasonably expected to result in thecatching, taking, or harvesting of quantities of a species of groundfishthat amount to 20 percent or more of the catch, take, or harvest, or 20percent or more of the total amount of fish or fish products on board atany time. The exception for the Gulf of Alaska FMP restricts the percentageto 4 percent, rather than 20 percent, for sablefish caught with hook-and-linegear. This definition of directed fishing is referred to as the directedfishing rule. Incidental catches in directed fisheries for other groundfish species aregenerally referred to as bycatches. Under the current directed fishingrule, retention of bycatches of groundfish species up to 20 percent ofthe total amount of the groundfish catch is allowed during times when directedfishing for the bycatch species is prohibited, as long as the directedfishing rule at 50 CFR 672.2 and 675.2 is not violated. Catches of 20 percentor more of a species have been presumed, for regulatory purposes, to resultfrom directed fishing. Representatives of the fishing industry contend that the current directedfishing rule is overly broad, placing the fisherman at unreasonable risk,because the rule is applied to the catching, rather than retention, ofgroundfish. Typically a fisherman does not know the composition of hiscatch until it is on board. Fishermen have commented to the Council andto NMFS that the strict application of this rule inappropriately causesits violation if the catch composition of a single longline set or trawlhaul inadvertently includes species in excess of permissible proportions,prior to the fishermen's knowledge of the catch. The Council has responded by recommending at its June, 1988, meeting thatthe definition be changed by regulatory amendment to allow enforcementon the basis of the amount of a groundfish species retained on board afishing vessel rather than the amount caught. Under this definition, afisherman would be allowed to sort his catch and discard at sea excessbycatch such that any amount retained on board would not exceed the allowablerate. This action would formalize what effectively has become the statusquo in this fishery. When the Council made this recommendation at the June 1988 meeting, theNOAA General Counsel announced that further prosecution of cases involvingthe directed fishing definition would be consistent with the Council'srecommendation. Most fishermen operated during the remainder of the 1988fishing year with this understanding. The Secretary conducted a reviewof the impacts that would result, should the definition be amended as theCouncil recommended. In December, 1988, the Secretary determined that certainobjectives in the FMPs that discouraged wasteful discarding of fish atsea might be undermined by the Council's recommendation. The Secretarypublished his intent to retain the directed fishing definition as currentlywritten in the regulations (54 FR 986, January 11, 1989). The Council reviewedthe Secretary's announced intent at its January 1989 meeting and receivedpublic testimony on expected impacts of that action. Many fishermen testified that, although they would have been in violationof a definition based on the standard of catch, take, or harvest, theywould not have been in violation of a definition based on amounts retainedon board. Part of that testimony made clear that, as a practical matter,detecting a violation based on observing catch, take, or harvest comparedto amounts retained on board was more difficult. The Council further determinedthat its objectives of reducing waste were in reality not in jeopardy and,in light of problems under the current definition, reaffirmed its June1988, recommendation that the directed fishing definition should be basedon amounts of groundfish retained on board a vessel. <T3>2. Definitions of Directed Fishing for Sablefish in the Bering Seaand Aleutian Islands Management Area</T3>Definition of directed fishing for sablefish_The Secretary has establishedtotal allowable catches (TACs) for each of the target groundfish speciesin 1989, including sablefish. The TAC for sablefish in the Bering Sea Subareais 2,380 mt. This amount is only 70 percent of that available in 1988.The Regional Director determined that this amount is necessary as bycatchin fisheries for other groundfish species during the remainder of the fishingyear. Therefore, the Secretary has prohibited directed fishing for sablefishin the Bering Sea Subarea, effective February 3, 1989 (54 FR 6134, February8, 1989). Due to the leniency of current sablefish bycatch regulationsand because sablefish are highly valued, the opportunity and incentiveto harvest in excess of actual bycatch needs remain. This situation isdetrimental to the resource and its proper conservation and management.At its December 1988 meeting, the Council reviewed the TAC it had recommendedfor the Bering Sea Subarea and the consequences that the current directedfishing definition would have on the 1989 sablefish fishery. Part of the Council's concern is a result of a management action takenby the Secretary in 1988 that closed the directed sablefish fishery atmidyear. In 1988, the TAC for sablefish was set at 3,400 mt in the BeringSea Subarea. Of this amount, 3,363 mt was allocated to domestic annualprocessing (DAP). This amount of the DAP was small in relation to DAPsfor other target species, but its poundage value to fishermen was large.In 1988, U.S. fishermen received an average of about $1.70 per pound forsablefish. Fishermen received only about $0.06 per pound when fishing forother groundfish, particularly trawl-caught pollock and flounders. The high value of sablefish encouraged U.S. fishermen to target on them.On June 11, 1988, the Secretary closed the sablefish fishery based on calculationsmade by the Regional Director that the directed fishery had caught 1,680mt, which was only 50 percent of the DAP (53 FR 22328, June 15, 1988).The balance was set aside as bycatch to support other target fisheries,which under the current directed fishery definition allowed fishermen tocatch and retain sablefish up to 20 percent of the total amount of groundfishon board a vessel as bycatch. Had the directed fishing definition requireda bycatch rate of sablefish closer to the typical incidental catch rate,the Secretary might have been able to allow the directed fishery to continuelonger into the fishing year. Under the current directed fishing definition, the Regional Director wasrequired to use 20 percent when calculating the amount of bycatch neededto implement the 1988 sablefish directed fishing closure. Although amountsof sablefish retained on board as bycatches of up to 20 percent technicallywould not have been in violation of the directed fishing definition, actualincidental catches of sablefish, especially in pollock, Pacific cod, andflounder fisheries by trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear, are usually aslow as 1 percent. Thus, even when directed sablefish fishing was prohibited,the incentive and opportunity to harvest in excess of actual bycatch needsprevailed. An unnecessary result was the early declaration of prohibitedspecies status for sablefish as required at 50 CFR 675.20(a)(8), resultingin excessive waste of this resource. The Council recommended that the Secretary implement an emergency ruleto amend the directed fishing definition with respect to sablefish in theBering Sea subarea by reducing the allowable percentage considered to bedirected fishing for sablefish. The Council recommended that directed fishingfor sablefish be defined as fishing that results in quantities of sablefishthat are 1 percent or more of the total amount of fish or fish products,excluding Pacific ocean perch (POP) and Greenland turbot, retained on boardat any time expressed in round weight equivalents. When POP or Greenlandturbot are part of the amount retained on board, the Council recommendeddirected fishing for sablefish be defined as fishing that results in quantitiesof sablefish that are 10 percent or more of the total amount of POP andGreenland turbot retained on board at any time, expressed in round weightequivalents. This latter quantity may be added to the amount of sablefishwhich may be allowed as measured against other fish. The Council determinedthat these percentages of sablefish closely approximate actual sablefishrates in the groundfish fisheries. Amounts of sablefish less than thesepercentages shall be considered to be bycatches in other directed fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations by the Secretary </ITAG>The Secretary has reviewed the Council's recommendations on each of theabove issues. With respect to enforcing the directed fishing definitionon the basis of the amount of groundfish retained on board rather thanon the basis of the amount of groundfish caught, the Secretary recognizesthe concerns regarding the current directed fishing definition. While theCouncil did not specifically vote at its June, 1988, meeting to recommendthat the Secretary amend the definition by emergency rule, the Secretaryhas considered the record developed by the Council at its December 1988meeting, and has determined under section 305(e)(1) that an emergency existsin the fishery due to the overly broad directed fishing definition, andthat the definition should be changed. The Secretary hereby rescinds thepolicy statement as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 54 FR 986 (January 11, 1989), regarding theintent to retain the existing directed fishing definition for all groundfishspecies on the basis of catch, take, or harvest. With respect to the definition of a directed sablefish fishery, the Secretaryconcurs with the Council's recommendation that the current regulation at50 CFR 675.2, which defines directed fishing for sablefish, causes an emergencyin the sablefish fishery. The Secretary is making this determination undersection 305(e)(2)(B) of the Magnuson Act. To take no action would undermineNMFS's intended management of the sablefish harvest, as authorized at 50CFR 675.20(a)(7). Under this regulation, NMFS closed the directed sablefishfishery in the Bering Sea Subarea, effective February 3, 1989, and intendsthat the entire remaining TAC be available as bycatch to support otherdirected fisheries during the fishing year. This action will effectivelyconserve sablefish only if small amounts of sablefish are actually caughtas bycatch. Since the 1 percent and 10 percent amounts for defining directedfishing approximate the actual bycatch rates, the Regional Director expectsthis action to minimize sablefish bycatch and the extent to which sablefishwould be discarded during the fishing year. Should the new limitationsof bycatch combined with the current closure in the directed fishery providemore than the amount of sablefish needed for bycatch, the Regional Directorwould allow a directed fishery for sablefish near year's end under andSection;675.20.Although the Council did not stipulate that a change in the definitionof the sablefish fishery should also apply to the Aleutian Islands Subarea,the Regional Director has determined that, for the same reasons given above,the current definition of directed fishing as its applies to sablefishalso constitutes an emergency in this subarea. The Secretary has establishedthe sablefish TAC in the Aleutian Island Subarea at 3,400 mt. The initialDAP equals the initial TAC of 2,890 mt. The 1988 catch in this subareawas 3,400 mt. Directed fishing for sablefish in the Aleutian Islands Subareacurrently is allowed. The Regional Director expects that this directedfishery will be closed to allow enough sablefish to be used in other targetfisheries. True bycatch rates are also as small as they are in the BeringSea Subarea. Therefore, the Secretary concurs with the Regional Director'sdetermination under section 305(e)(1) of the Magnuson Act and declaresthat an emergency exists in the Aleutians Islands Subarea sablefish fisheryand is implementing the new definition of a directed sablefish fisheryin this subarea also.While the definition of directed fishing in the Gulf of Alaska uses a 20percent lower limit, the Regional Director has reviewed the conditionsin this fishery and determined that the 20 percent limit does not constitutean emergency justifying action in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thisrule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and that it is consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This rule is implementedfor 90 days under section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act and may be extendedfor an additional 90 days with the agreement of the Council.The Assistant Administrator also finds for good cause that the reasonsjustifying promulgation of this rule on an emergency basis also make itimpractical and contrary to the public interest to provide prior noticeand opportunity for comment or to delay for 30 days its effective date,under provisions of section 553 (b) and (d) of the Administrative ProcedureAct. This rule must be implemented as soon as possible to relieve a restrictionand to minimize wastage of sablefish and pollock in the Bering Sea andAleutian Islands Management Area.The Regional Director prepared an environmental assessment for this action.The Assistant Administrator concluded that no significant impact on thehuman environment would result from this rule. A copy of this documentmay be obtained from the Regional Director at the address listed above.This emergency interim rule is exempt from the normal review proceduresof Executive Order 12291 as provided in section 8(a)(1) of that order.It is being reported to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,with an explanation of why it is not possible to follow the regular proceduresof that order.This emergency interim rule is exempt from the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, because it is issued without opportunity for prior publiccomment.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Assistant Administrator has determined that this rule will be implementedin a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with theapproved coastal zone management program of the State of Alaska. This determinationhas been submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 675</ITAG>Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
