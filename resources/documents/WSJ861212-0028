The accord also provides for the cancellation of an earlier contract in return for a $29 million payment to the unit from the utility.    Under terms of the contract, Nerco's Antelope Coal Co. would supply coal to the Platte River Power Authority for 30 years, or until 25 million tons of coal are delivered to the utility. Financial terms weren't disclosed. This contract would replace an earlier 20-year contract providing for delivery of about 17 million tons of coal. The $29 million payment is consideration for terminating the original contract, Nerco said.    Nerco is a 90%-owned mining and resource development subsidiary of PacifiCorp, a utility company also based here. </TEXT></DOC>
