In a major speech outlining his goal to ``welcome the SovietUnion back into the world order,'' Bush also said he would bewilling to ease the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 17-year-old law thatties trade concessions to with East bloc nations with thosecountries' emigration policies.   ``The United States now has as its goal much more than simplycontaining Soviet expansionism _ we seek the integration of theSoviet Union into the community of nations,'' the president said inthe text of a speech announcing his administration's policyprinciples for relations with Moscow.   Bush took a carrot-and-stick approach to the Soviet Union in hisaddress to a commencement audience at Texas Aandamp;M University, sayinghe wanted the two superpowers to enjoy ``a friendship that knows noseason of suspicion, no chill of distrust.''   `As the Soviet Union moves toward greater openness anddemocratization, as they meet the challenge of responsibleinternational behavior, we will match their steps with steps of ourown,'' he said.   ``Ultimately our objective is to welcome the Soviet Union backinto the world order.''   Bush called for revival of a 1950s proposal by PresidentEisenhower that would have allowed each nation to fly unarmedinspection aircraft over the other's territory, which ``would openup military activities to regular scrutiny.''   Bush proposed that this never-implemented ``open skies'' policybe expanded to include all nations in the East and West.   ``Such unprecedented territorial access would show the world themeaning of the concept of openness,'' he said. ``The very Sovietwillingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitmentto change.''   En route here aboard Air Force One, national security adviserBrent Scowcroft acknowledged to reporters that satellites conductmost of the intelligence surveillance today. But he said theopen-skies use of aircraft would have some advantages in eeingbelow cloud cover.   And, Scowcroft said, ``Symbolically it's very important,''because aerial surveillance would represent an abandonment oftraditional secrecy by the Soviets.   ``This speech and the next one are not designed to be catchy,''he said. ``We're in an unusual phase of history right now,'' andthe administration is trying to look ahead to end of the centuryand develop new policies.   As for the Jackson-Vanik law, Bush said he would work withCongress for a `temporary waiver'' of the restrictions on Soviettrade status, if the Kremlin would codify a liberalization ofemigration laws.   He said his administration would respond positively if theSoviets also ``take positive steps.''   These, he said, include reducing their military forces abroad,tearing down barriers between Eastern and Western Europe, improvingtheir human rights commitment and working with the West `inpositive, practical _ not merely rhetorical steps'' to solvinginternational regional disputes.   `Where there is cooperation, there can be a broader economicrelationship ...,'' the president said. ``Ending discriminatorytreatment of U.S. firms would be a helpful step. Trade andfinancial transactions should take place on a normal commercialbasis.''   As he has in the past, Bush said he welcomed the Soviet movestoward glasnost, or openness, and economic restructuring.   But he sounded a skeptical note, saying these ``hopeful _ indeedremarkable _ signs'' should be viewed in the vein that Westernsecurity `is not predicated on hope. It must be based on deeds. Welook for enduring, ingrained economic and political change.''   ``Make no mistake, a new breeze is blowing across the steppesand cities of the Soviet Union. Why not, then, let this spirit ofopenness grow, let more barriers come down,'' Bush said.   He called for ``open emigration, open debate, open airwaves,''and said: ``Let the 19,000 Soviet Jews who emigrated last year befollowed by any number who wish to emigrate this year.''   The Jackson-Vanik measure, named for the late Sen. Henry M.Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, R-Ohio, denies theSoviets a host of trade advantages, including reduced tariffs,unless they relax their restrictions on emigration of Jews andothers wishing to leave. It was included in a 1972 trade law.   In advance of the speech, American Jewish groups gave a mixedreaction to Bush's proposal to ease the measure.   ``It's clearly a move that we would support,'' said MarkPelavin, a spokesman for the American Jewish Congress. ``We thinkthat the changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union arechanges we must recognize.''   David Harris of the American Jewish Committee said the move``sends the right combination of signals _ on the one hand, acontinued American insistence on performance by the Soviets; on theother hand, an American willingness to respond to such performancewith flexibility.''   The National Conference on Soviet Jewry was more cautious.   ``Our official position is, we are against the waiver,'' saidspokesman Jerry Strober, adding that his group is ``reassessing itsview'' and may update it when its board of governors assembles inWashington June 13.   Strober said the conference recommends four criteria the Sovietsshould meet before Jackson-Vanik is waived _ sustained andsubstantial Jewish emigration, resolution of longstandingrefuseniks, the promise to codify emigration law, and specific timelimitations on refusals for reasons of state secrecy.   The Soviets have been allowing expanded emigration throughcase-by-case decisions, and the United States is looking for theless restrictive rules to be put into more formal regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
