The $100,000 recreation of a float that first rolled throughPhiladelphia's streets on July 4, 1788, has stood in orphanedgrandeur among prison buses and police cars on a city parking lotfor much of the past year.   Members of the Carpenters' Company and the ArchitecturalWoodwork Institute built the float with the intention that it couldbe displayed as a lasting memorial of the bicentennial of theConstitution.   But the city, which was given the float after the Sept. 17,1987, parade, hasn't received a proposal for its display by someonewho could care properly for it, officials said.   ``We really had everyone's interest in mind,'' said PublicProperty Commissioner Benjamin F. Ellis Jr. ``We didn't have anyintention of letting (the float) be destroyed.''   For example, he said, ``There's no point in placing it in apark. No one would maintain it, and it would be destroyed in twoyears.''   Edward Kobler of the woodwork institute said some proposalsrejected by city officials would have been suitable. ``Theycouldn't make up their minds what to do with it,'' he said.   A city crane helped workers take apart the 36-foot-tall templebearing the motto ``In union the fabric stands firm.'' It will bestored at a suburban warehouse, repaired and eventually _ itscreators hope _ turned over to someone who will display it.   ``We silly people would like to keep it in Philadelphia,'' saidLeon Clemmer, president of the Carpenters' Company, a socialorganization rooted in a powerful 18th-century craft guild thatbuilt the original edifice.   Topped by a plaster statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess ofagriculture, the float was pulled through rainy streets by eightgray draft horses during the 1987 parade.   Its troubles, however, began hours after the parade when Cereswas toppled by some overhead wires.   Crippled, it was parked across from the southeast corner of CityHall.   Merchants complained, so it was moved to a construction site ablock away and then to the city parking lot where it stood untilThursday.   Finally, with the float's seams splitting and molding rotting,Clemmer asked the city to give it back.</TEXT></DOC>
