Israel's top leaders, meanwhile, agreed to send Foreign MinisterMoshe Arens to meet his American and Egyptian counterparts forpeace talks.   Because of the widespread curfews and damp, rainy weather,streets in many towns and refugee camps in the West Bank and GazaStrip were deserted except for military patrols.   No major violence was reported, but the army said rock throwingand early morning disturbances prompted at least some of thecurfews, on eight West Bank refugee camps and at least five townsand villages.   In Gaza, two Palestinians were shot and wounded when they lefttheir homes in violation of curfew orders, Arab reporters said.   Underground Palestinian leaders have called for a general strikethroughout the occupied lands Saturday to usher in the third yearof the ``intefadeh,'' the rebellion that began in Gaza's Jebaliyarefugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987.   Since then, Palestinians have staged hundreds of strikes andthousands of protests to demand an end to Israeli rule in the WestBank and Gaza. Captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 MiddleEast War, the two territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.   During the uprising, 626 Palestinians have been killed byIsraelis, and 155 others have been slain by fellow Arabs, most onsuspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three Israelis havedied in the violence.   Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin said on Israel radio thatthe revolt was costing Israel about $1 billion a year.   ``It is already enough to fill the budgets of six or sevengovernment ministries,'' he complained.   The most dramatic incident Friday was in Arab east Jerusalem,annexed by Israel after its capture from Jordan 22 years ago.   About 300 Palestinians gathered outside the Old City's Al AqsaMosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines, after prayer services andchanted ``PLO! Israel No!'' and other anti-Israeli slogans.   Three youths, their faces masked with Arab scarves, waved anoutlawed Palestinian flag. One placard raised by the demonstratorsread: ``Congratulations to the intefadeh.''   Police snipers and anti-terror squads were stationed on rooftopsoverlooking the mosque, but they did not intervene and thedemonstration ended quietly.   At least 1,800 extra policemen and paramilitary border policewere stationed in Jerusalem to prevent violence, and officials said400 more would be brought in for Saturday's strike.   Troops also were sent to the occupied territories and along theborders with Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt to block guerrillas frominfiltrating in support of the uprising anniversary.   Israeli officials claimed Friday that Yasser Arafat's Fatah PLOfaction was behind an infiltration attempt by five armed guerrillaswho were intercepted and killed near the border with Egypt.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theFatah squad planned a ``mass killing'' to mark Friday's secondanniversary of the Palestinian uprising.   The guerrillas, armed with automatic rifles and 51 handgrenades, were killed in a hilly area of the Negev Desert nearMount Harif on Tuesday. It was the fifth infiltration attempt fromEgypt this year, according to army figures.   The Gaza Strip's 750,000 residents were under curfew for asecond consecutive day Friday, and a curfew imposed on Nablus, theWest Bank's largest town with 120,000 people, remained in force foran eighth day.   The markets in Bethlehem and Ramallah, major Arab towns nearJerusalem, were closed down by security forces and shoppers wereordered home, residents said.   Despite the curfew, fresh uprising graffiti appeared on walls insome towns and refugee camps. In Hebron, one slogan in black said:``Intefadeh until victory. We die standing and not kneeling.''   On the other side, Jewish settlers drove through the West Bankand hung blue-and-white Israeli flags from utility poles andscrawled slogans on Arab-owned homes to assert their right to thedisputed land.   ``We will fight to the end,'' said one slogan written in Hebrewon a wall in Bethlehem.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an interview publishedFriday in the daily Yediot Ahronot that he could not predict whenthe uprising would end.   ``I can only say that after two years that it has run wild,those who are arranging and initiating it have not obtainedanything and ... they will also obtain nothing,'' he said.   Asked what he would do if he were a Palestinian, Shamir replied:``If I had to put on the other shoe of the Palestinians, I wouldwant a Palestinian state, a state where the Palestinian people wereruling.''   But Shamir, who opposes surrendering any occupied land, saidsuch a state already exists in neighboring Jordan.   Israel's four senior leaders met in Jerusalem and agreed to U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal for a meeting withhis Israeli and Egyptian counterparts as a first step in the MiddleEast peace process.   Baker urged such a meeting in Washington to lead toIsraeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's proposal for elections in theoccupied territories.   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein said the leaders of thecoalition government agreed to send Arens to the meeting but wantedpreliminary talks first to decide the time and whether it would bein Washington.   Friday's meeting was attended by Shamir and Arens of theright-wing Likud bloc and Finance Minister Shimon Peres and DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin of the center-left Labor Party.   In Baghdad, Iraq, political parties and groups from more than adozen Arab nations and the PLO met Friday to form a group tosupport the uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands.   The new Arab Popular Front will officially be announced Saturdayat a mass rally in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, to mark the secondanniversary of the insurrection.   The front plans to organize national committees in each Arabcountry to organize donations for the Palestinians in the occupiedlands.</TEXT></DOC>
