Schiffman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA PRO </IN><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The shakeout in the health-care industry has produced lots of casualties; it has also produced some winners. Robert D. Carl, a 34-year-old entrepreneur, saw the cost squeeze as an opportunity, and -- so far -- is ahead in a risky game.    Mr. Carl formed Health Images Inc., a closely held start-up company, five years ago and began opening clinics that offered an expensive but promising technique called magnetic resonance imaging, known as MR. The company emerged from the development stage and became profitable earlier this year.    This month, it reported an impressive 48% increase to $560,000 in third-quarter earnings on a 69% rise in revenue to $7.1 million. It plans to expand quickly in the next 20 months, opening nine more clinics (it now has 13) and assembling its own equipment.    The company's success has resulted in part from Mr. Carl's ability to identify and capitalize on new MR technology early on. MR uses powerful magnets, radio waves and computers to generate internal-body images more safely, and in some cases, more effectively, than CAT scanning, an imaging technique that emits radiation. These days, it is being used increasingly to diagnose brain tumors but may also become a major tool in diagnosing heart problems and even predicting strokes. Mr. Carl also was able to exploit a loophole in health-care cost-cutting: various state regulations that, in recent years, have prevented or discouraged many hospitals from buying expensive MR machines haven't applied to outpatient clinics such as Mr. Carl's.    Mr. Carl was a less than successful lawyer in 1982 when he got into business. He joined a small health-care company that had been his client and helped it open an imaging center in Atlanta. He later bought out the two other partners in the company and formed Health Images. &quot;I was a struggling, starving lawyer and I always wanted to be a businessman,&quot; he says.    For all his recent success, some competitors believe Mr. Carl is playing an increasingly risky game. States are backing away from regulations requiring hospitals to justify major equipment purchases, so more hospitals are getting into the MR business. Technology, in this area, is advancing so quickly that some wonder whether small players like Mr. Carl can keep up. &quot;Can he do it for the next 10 years? I don't think so,&quot; says Lew Meyer, president and chief executive officer of American Health Services Corp., a Newport Beach, Calif., competitor. Mr. Carl says he has adequate capital to pursue his strategy of keeping up with the innovators in this business, much like International Business Machines Corp. clone-makers imitate IBM.    On top of fiercer competition, Mr. Carl, who is chairman and chief executive of Health Images, is taking a high-risk, go-it-alone strategy. While other small competitors buy their equipment from suppliers, Mr. Carl is assembling his own imaging machines in-house to save money. Many of his competitors take on doctors or hospitals as partners to ensure a source of patient referrals. NMR of America Inc., based in Morristown, N.J., for instance, manages MR clinics for physicians who find them too much trouble, while American Health runs clinics for hospitals. Mr. Carl doesn't plan to rely on such attachments in the future. &quot;If you have physician investors, you alienate other doctors,&quot; he says.    Some of Mr. Carl's plans have already riled the likes of General Electric Co. Frank Balicki, manager of financial services for GE's medical systems group, questions the ability of Health Images to build MR machines in-house. &quot;That's like you telling me the guy down the street is going to assemble the F-14 fighter. I wouldn't want my kid to ride in one,&quot; he says.    &quot;That's an incredibly arrogant statement to make,&quot; responds Mr. Carl, who emphasizes that he will make MR machines only for his own clinics and isn't planning to take on GE.    Even so, upsetting a big competitor like GE isn't a good idea, says Mr. Meyer of American Health. &quot;I have been on the manufacturing side of this business,&quot; he says. &quot;I have competed with GE, Philips and Siemens, and it's no fun. The big guys always win, and I don't mean most of the time. I mean always win.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
