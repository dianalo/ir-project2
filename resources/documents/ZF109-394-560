(Simple Network ManagementProtocol)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Trade ShowsSimple Network Management ProtocolInterOpProtocolTelecommunicationsReports.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IntroductionandM;Since its introduction at INTEROP 88, Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP) has rapidly gained wide acceptance and availability from vendors.andO;Although SNMP originated in the TCP/IP communications arena, it is now ofmuch broader application.andP;  The monitoring and control transactions performedby SNMP are independent of TCP/IP, and SNMP now runs over a wide variety ofstandards based on connectionless datagram transport services, as well asTCP/IP.andP;  Keeping SNMP simple has allowed progress in developing interoperablenetwork management tools, surpassing the number of OSI Common ManagementInformation Protocol (CMIP) offerings.andM;This Special Report examines a number of offerings that were demonstrated atINTEROP 90.andP;  One of the interesting aspects of the INTEROP demonstration wasthat many vendors were displaying various SNMP wares from other vendors inthe same booth as their own offerings!andP;  A key point was proving that SNMPdata can be obtained from agents from competing devices, such as bridges orremote collection devices.andP;  Key differentiating features in the managementstations themselves included the way in which the data is presented to theuser, and whether or not &quot;proprietary&quot; extensions to the SNMP MIB and MIB IIstandards could be viewed or customized on a competing SNMP managementstation.andM;The remainder of this Special Report examines a number of vendors products,presented in order by vendor name.andM;ACC Demonstrates SNMP WaresandM;Using the newly released Version 2.0 of its ACS 4800 network managementsystem to monitor devices such as FDDI equipment and token-ring networks,Advanced Computer Communications (ACC) participated in the INTEROP 90 SNMPdemonstration, conducted Oct. 8-12, in San Jose, CA.andM;Version 2.0 of the ACS 4800 Network Management System, demonstrated for thefirst time at INTEROP, offers network managers an interface to monitor andtroubleshoot multi-vendor networks from a single point.andM;Among the new features of Version 2.0 of the ACS 4800 Network ManagementSystem are: an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow the additionof other management protocols, such as OSI's CMIP, without modifying the userinterface; a MIB Utilities tool designed to make it simpler for users to addprivate MIB extensions to the system to more effectively manage othervendors' devices; and a relational database to speed-up user access and allowdata to be stored for analysis and imported into any ANSI-compliantstructured query language (SQL) application.andM;In addition to integrating more information through the use of MIB Utilities,an SQL database, and an API, ACC has updated polling procedures to improveinformation gathering.andP;  The new ACS 4800 release can now poll devices basedon importance and filter events by rating them as high-, medium-, orlow-severity.andM;Version 2.0 adds a hierarchical network map that addresses screen sizelimitations by organizing the network into either geographic or logicalsegments.andP;  By selecting a site, the user can &quot;zoom&quot; network devices in thatsegment into view.andM;The ACS 4800 is now compliant with Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s SunView andOpenWindow or any X-11 Release 4-compliant server.andM;The ACS 4800 Version 2.0 lists for $12,500 and will be available for shippingin November.andM;Information:  Marianne McCarthy, Advanced Computer Communications, 720 SantaBarbara St., Santa Barbara, CA; (805) 963-9431.andM;BBN Chooses EMA As Base For Its Network ManagementandM;WAN vendor BBN Communications has let it be known that it has chosen DigitalEquipment Corporation's Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), and theDECmcc Director software, as the network management platform upon which itplans to build its next-generation integrated network management system.andP;  BBNexpects this platform to allow present and future customers to monitor andcontrol their diverse, wide-area backbone networks more efficiently andcost-effectively.andM;The company is now a member of Digital's DECmcc Strategic Vendor Program andhas stated its intention to OEM Digital's DECmcc Director software.andP;  BBN wasthe first company to utilize the DECMCC Director as a software platform uponwhich to integrate its network management system products.andM;BBN Communications intends to build a unified architecture on the Digitalplatform to manage all the wide-area network components in its product line.andO;In addition, BBN intends to utilize EMA to link to other OSI-based networkmanagement systems, in order to pass the status and control information.andM;BBN plans to initially develop advanced planning, operations, and integrationcapabilities for general release in the first half of 1991.andM;For existing customers, BBN anticipates a phased migration from the currentBBN Communications network management system, without disruption to existingnetwork service.andM;Information:  Sheryl Schultz, BBN Communications, 150 Cambridge Park Drive,MA 02140;

 The product is based on thecompany's new Inductive Modeling Technology, which is said to allow a singleexecutive control server--on any LAN in the connected enterprise--to deduce,correct, and report problems to any number of SPECTRUM control consoleslocated anywhere in the enterprise.andM;By utilizing a graphical X-Windows user interface, SPECTRUM can flag a bad orquestionable network component, showing its location on geographical maps,campus layouts, building plans, or logical network topology maps.andP;  SPECTRUMcan also take steps to correct or minimize problems where appropriate.andP;  Theproduct will be available in early 1991 at prices starting just under $50,000(all prices direct from Cabletron).andM;SPECTRUM is said to offer an extensible architecture based on softwaremodeling of each and every element of the network, including equipment,users, privileges, and more.andP;  By adding new Induction Rules to itsmodel-based reasoning scheme, SPECTRUM can also capture and systemize theknowledge and preferences of a network administrator.andM;The heart of SPECTRUM is the Virtual Network Machine which embodies a modelof the enterprise network and each of its sub- elements.andP;  The company'sreasoning-capable technology is said, by Cabletron, to provide an agile,adaptive, and automatic way to model and control entities with software;SPECTRUM is its first commercial application, says Cabletron.andM;Inductive Modeling creates programmatic models of each individual subfunctionof a larger entity.andP;  Each of these &quot;molecular&quot; subfunction models&quot;understands&quot; the attributes and behavior of its real-world counterpart.andO;These molecular models are context-aware, interacting with each other toadjust their behavior as other subfunction models change status, appear, ordisappear.andP;  Through these adaptive subfunction responses, large- entitysystem models exhibit inductive reasoning.andM;Information:  Michael Welts, Cabletron Systems, Inc., 35 Industrial Way,Rochester, NH 03867;

 The LANB/150P is an Ethernet traffic monitor whichcan report traffic statistics on a LAN segment to a number of differentmanagement stations.andP;  It can be monitored by SNMP-based network managementsystems or by NAT's Network Management System--which uses proprietaryprotocols.andM;Designed for multi-vendor, multi-protocol environments, the EtherMeter isattached to individual link segments that are connected by local or remotebridges.andP;  The traffic statistics collected by all EtherMeters in aninternetwork can be accessed by NAT's Network Management Station (NMS/100) orby SNMP network management stations supplied by other vendors.andM;The data gathered by NAT's EtherMeter can be used to determine how thenetwork is performing, diagnose network problems, manage network traffic, andplan expansion.andM;Available as either a full-sized PC AT card ($1,595) or as stand-alone unit($1,795), the LANB/150P EtherMeter initializes automatically and startsmonitoring network traffic as soon as it is attached to an Ethernet.andP;  Segmentstatus lights on the stand-alone unit provide local indicators of LANactivity and system status.andM;If a problem with a particular segment is suspected, a network administratorcan use NAT's Network Management Station or an SNMP-based management stationto poll the EtherMeter attached to the segment.andP;  The EtherMeter will reportits status and network traffic statistics.andP;  These statistics include:andM;-    The number of good packetsandM;-    The number of multicast and broadcast packetsandM;-    The total number of bytes in all packetsandM;-    Packets with errorsandM;-    The number of packets with CRC errorsandM;-    The number of transmit collisionsandM;-    The number of short packetsandM;-    The number of oversize packetsandM;-    The number of packets out of alignmentandM;-    Ethernet packet typesandM;-    The distribution of packets by packet typeandM;-    The number of protocols being used in the networkandM;A recently introduced Top10 function lets network administrators monitortraffic on the ten most active nodes in an Ethernet segment.andP;  According toNAT, the ten most active nodes usually account for more than 90% of theproblems that cause network slowdowns or failures.andM;The Top10 function pinpoints the ten nodes that are operating above auser-defined threshold of traffic activity.andP;  Network managers can chooseamong seven monitoring criteria that are based on either the Ethernet addressor IP (Internetwork Protocol) address.andP;  These are:  Ethernet Talkers,Ethernet Listeners, Ethernet Broadcaster, IP Talkers, IP Listeners, IP Pairs,and Ethernet Pairs.andP;  A network manager can also set the threshold (measuredin packets per second) and the sampling interval (measured in seconds).andP;  Theinformation gathered by the Top10 can be logged for later analysis.andP;  Settinga broadcast threshold of 50 packets per second, e.g., could help a networkmanager log the station addresses of nodes that are transmitting excessivebroadcast packets on a segment.andM;Information:  Homer Jamison, Network Application Technology, 21040 HomesteadRoad, Cupertino, CA 95014;
