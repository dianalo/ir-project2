Principal results so farinclude: 1) Differential charging occurs when part or all of the spacecraftis permanently in shadow and when there is a net flux of electrons tothe spacecraft, 2) In an eclipse the current balance can charge froma triple root to a single root solution with a small charge in spectrumas had been predicted, 3) The level of differential voltages betweenadjacent parts of the spacecraft can be clamped at the relatively lowvoltage of the second cross-over point in the secondary emission yieldcurve (approx. volts), 4) Despite being inside a 1-metre-long, conductingbaffle the radiometer mirror caused significant charging of the spacecraft,5) Although most of the anomalies of Meteosat 2 are probably not associatedwith arcing they do have a natural cause, 6) Where it is not possiblefor the outer surface of a spacecraft to be conducting, the harmful effectsof differential charging can be reduced by use of materials with highsecondary-emission coefficients, 7)An electron albedo index, based onempirical values of secondary emission coefficients and backscatter ratioshas been reasonably in determining the liability of the spacecraft tocharging.</TEXT></DOC>
