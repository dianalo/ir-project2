New York-based agents Norby Walters, 56 years old, and Lloyd Bloom, 29, entered pleas before U.S. District Judge George Marovich, who released them on their own recognizance and set trial for Feb. 27.    Messrs. Walters and Bloom refused to discuss the case. They were indicted Wednesday on charges of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion.    They are accused of using money and gifts to entice dozens of players into signed agreements, some of them postdated, allowing the agents to represent them in professional contract negotiations.    The National Collegiate Athletic Association prohibits college players from signing representation contracts or taking money while still eligible to compete.    If the players tried to back out of the deals, they were warned that Messrs. Walters and Bloom had friends who would break their legs, said U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas.    The indictment named reputed organized crime figure Michael Franzese as an unindicted co-conspirator, alleging that Messrs. Walters and Bloom used his reputation to coerce athletes into signing contracts. Mr. Franzese is serving a 10-year federal prison term in California for racketeering and tax violations.    The indictment said Mr. Walters, who heads World Sports andamp; Entertainment Inc. in New York, also used threats to sign acts in the music business.    If convicted, the two each would face a maximum of 70 years in prison and $2 million in fines.    In a related case, California-based sports agent Dave Lueddeke, 37, was charged Wednesday with Cris Carter, 22, a wide receiver with the National Football League's Philadelphia Eagles.    Mr. Carter, who left Ohio State with a year of college eligibility remaining, was charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud. Mr. Lueddeke was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from an alleged $5,000 payment to Mr. Carter.    If convicted, Mr. Carter would face up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, while Mr. Lueddeke would face up to 15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine. </TEXT></DOC>
