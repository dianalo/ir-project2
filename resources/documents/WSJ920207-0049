The new round of cost-cutting and a sweepingreorganization were outlined Jan. 14 in a forceful, urgentpresentation to senior executives by Digital's president,Kenneth H. Olsen, said people who attended the meeting.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Olsen's plans follow news of an unexpectedly steeploss for the fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the firstoperating loss in the 35-year history of the Maynard, Mass.,company.   A memo that summarizes Mr. Olsen's remarks has beencirculating within the company and was obtained by The WallStreet Journal. It says that Mr. Olsen intends to streamlineproduct packaging and engineering and kill off what he called&quot;perpetual projects&quot; that divert precious engineering fundsto a few small-volume products.   The move is likely to be welcomed by investors. &quot;There'sno question Digital has room to cut its spending on research&quot;and remain technologically innovative, said Jay P. Stevens,an analyst with Dean Witter. &quot;It's not a question of doingless research. It's a question of doing it more efficiently.Their expense structure is completely out of whack, andalmost anything they cut is positive.&quot;   A senior manager who attended the luncheon meeting at thecompany's headquarters quoted Mr. Olsen as saying that &quot;bigcompanies like Digital can't expect to compete in everyniche.&quot;   It wasn't clear whether all the $400 million in cutssought by Mr. Olsen would come from Digital's $1.6 billionresearch budget. Some of it apparently will come from theamount spent by the company on manufacturing engineering, afigure that Digital doesn't disclose, one insider said.   Still, a large cut in research spending would be painfulfor Digital, which has long taken pride in its heavyinvestment in research. According to Inside Randamp;D, published byTechnical Insights Inc. of Englewood, N.J., Digital rankedfifth in 1990 in research spending by the largest U.S.corporations, after General Motors Corp., InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., Ford Motor Co. and AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Moreover, as a proportion ofrevenue, Digital's $1.6 billion research budget -- at 12.5%of its calendar 1990 revenue -- far exceeded that of GM,Ford, IBM or ATandamp;T.   In the year ended last June 30, Digital spent $1.65billion on research and engineering. Research spending in thefirst six months of the current fiscal year rose slightly to$829 million but was essentially flat after excluding theeffect of two recent European acquisitions.   A Digital spokesman refused to confirm or deny the $400million figure mentioned in the memo. He said: &quot;We areworking to hold down Randamp;D spending, just as we are working toreduce spending across the company. Engineering isn't exemptfrom that processs.&quot;   He added: &quot;There is indeed a new effort under way tostreamline the Digital product set and scale down the numberof individual product offerings.&quot; For example, a typicalcomputer may be offered with dozens of configurations andpackaging options, he said.   Mark Steinkrauss, director of investor relations, saidDigital already has in place initiatives that will save $1billion in annual expenses in future years. Digital has takena total of $1.65 billion in restructuring charges over thepast two years to cover the cost of plant closings, productconsolidations and work force reductions.   Mr. Olsen's presentation didn't address accelerated workforce reductions, which were widely expected after theannouncement of the second-quarter results. Digital posted anet loss of $138.3 million, or $1.11 a share, on a weak 4%revenue increase to $3.48 billion.   Terry Shannon, an Ashland, Mass., consultant, said Mr.Olsen will begin a companywide reorganization in two to threeweeks with the goal of simplifying product lines andmarketing. He said he expects several senior executives tolose their jobs in the move.   Peter Burris, director of Digital research forInternational Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., said Digital is&quot;re-evaluating every one of its product lines&quot; as it beginsthe transition to a new computer design, code-named Alpha,expected this year.   Mr. Olsen was unusually tough on his top managers in theJan. 14 presentation. One of those who attended paraphrasedMr. Olsen's message this way: &quot;We no longer have appropriatejobs for some of the company's very senior managers. Theywill either figure this out for themselves or be fired.&quot;   Digital shares closed $1.50 lower yesterday at $52.875 inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Separately, Digital responded to price cuts by competitorsby reducing prices on personal computers and related productsby 5% to 35%. Digital this month began a major push to sellmail-order personal computers made to its design by IntelCorp. and Tandy Corp.   The cuts follow announcements this week by Dell ComputerCo., a major competitor, that it cut prices 4% to 38% on PCsand by Apple Computer Inc. that it reduced its prices as muchas 37%.   Digital also is considering taking more of its PCmanufacturing in-house, company insiders said. One executivesaid the move would replace some of the PCs purchased fromTandy, but he wouldn't be more specific.</TEXT></DOC>
