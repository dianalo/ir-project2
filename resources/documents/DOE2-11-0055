<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0055 </DOCNO><TEXT>Numerical algorithms for surface tension and viscosity are presented inthe context of a Lagrangian treatment of incompressible hydrodynamicswith a dynamically restructuring grid. New algorithms are given whichupdate previous Lagrangian approaches in the code SPLISH. Test problemsinvolving internal gravity and capillary waves, an oscillating dropletand a viscous shear layer are described. An example is given of a flowcalculated in and around a viscous droplet with surface tension in ashear flow.</TEXT></DOC>
