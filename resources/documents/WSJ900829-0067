The department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration said the new program will affect petrochemicalcompanies with more than 2,500 workers. The inspections willcover oil refining and the manufacture of plastics andsynthetic resins, synthetic rubber, cellulosic and otherman-made fibers, and certain industrial organic chemicals,OSHA said.</LP><TEXT>   The safety inspection program was spurred by recentchemical-industry explosions, including those at a PhillipsPetroleum Co. plastics complex near Houston last October andone at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, Texas, lastmonth. Arco Chemical is a unit of Atlantic Richfield Co.   Those explosions killed 40 workers and injured manyothers.   OSHA said its safety investigators have concluded, amongother things, that their regular inspection program isn'tgeared to stopping the infrequent but disastrous explosionsthat can occur at chemical facilities. Many of the plantssingled out for the special inspections generally wouldn't bevisited, said Susan Fleming, an OSHA spokeswoman, because theindustry's overall injury rate is relatively low. &quot;There areother, more dangerous places,&quot; she said.   But when the department sent a report to President Bush inApril on the Phillips explosions last fall, it said that OSHAwould &quot;revise its current system for setting agencypriorities,&quot; to include assessing the risk of &quot;catastrophicevents&quot; at chemical plants. Ms. Fleming said that meant &quot;moreintensive&quot; inspections in order to examine the plants'processing methods for highly hazardous chemicals.   Each inspection will cover the entire plant and include an&quot;in-depth&quot; look at one process unit, Gerard Scannell, head ofOSHA, said.   OSHA has been criticized for doing low-level chemicalinspections. Two months before the Phillips' explosions, anaccident at the same plant killed one worker and seriouslyinjured two others. After the accident, OSHA didn't do acomplete inspection; the last full inspection prior to theOctober 1989 explosions was in 1974.   After the August 1989 accident, OSHA fined Phillips only$720. In April of this year, after making a full inspectionin October, OSHA proposed fines of $5.7 million againstPhillips, alleging willful safety violations in connectionwith the Houston explosions. The company is contesting thefines.   The department has begun an inspection of the Arco plant,but no fines have yet been proposed.   Last month, on the heels of the Arco explosion, OSHAformally proposed rules to require chemical-plant managersand others to adopt rigorous safety programs. This includesusing a more thorough method for identifying, judging andcontrolling chemical processes. It also includes such stepsas evaluating plant valves for safety hazards, keepingequipment in good shape, and properly training company andcontract workers.</TEXT></DOC>
