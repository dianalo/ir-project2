The full toroidal belt ALT-IIproject, and pump limiters in D-IIID, JT-60, and Tore Supra are in thedesign and construction phase. Possible experiments on the Tokamak FusionTest Reactor, the Joint European Torus, and the Advanced Toroidal Facilitymay be implemented soon. All of these experiments will utilize the demonstratedparticle and heat-removal capabilities of pump limiters.</TEXT></DOC>
