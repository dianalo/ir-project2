By early June, the company's initial public offering offour million shares is expected to be priced between $9 and$11 each. Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. is leading the underwritingsyndicate.</LP><TEXT>   Of the four million shares being offered, three millionare being sold by the company and one million by existingshareholders.   This &quot;reverse LBO&quot; phenomenon is the flip side of the1980's buy-out craze, when many companies went private withheaps of debt. Analysts say high interest rates and a slowingeconomy are now putting pressure on some of these companiesto raise cash to pay debt.   But the market hasn't been very kind to recent &quot;reverseLBOs.&quot; So far this year such deals have generally come tomarket at the low end or below their original price talkrange. Geneva Steel, for example, went public in March at $10a share, far below its price talk of $14 to $16 a share. Andthe offering Rival Co., another kitchen appliance maker, hasbeen postponed.   But analysts cite a host of concerns about Mr. Coffee:   The company still carries a large debt; its business iscurrently based on a single product line; its market ismature and crowded with well-financed competitors; aboutone-third of its sales go to just five customers; and nearlyhalf its production is based in China and Hong Kong.   But there's another side.   Proceeds from Mr. Coffee's offering will slash thecompany's long-term debt to about 53% of its total capitalfrom 83%. And the company states in its preliminaryprospectus that it has been moving much of its manufacturingback home.   Perhaps most important to prospective investors, thecompany is making money once again for the first time since1986.   Mr. Coffee's resurgence to profitability comes on the backof a product -- an iced tea maker called The Iced Tea Pot --which it introduced in May 1989. The product accounted fornearly all of the company's 24% sales increase in 1989, andnearly all of 1990's first quarter 53% growth in sales.   &quot;After that initial burst of sales, it's really unknown asto what's going to happen,&quot; says Robert Natale, who tracksnew issues for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Kimberly Rawn, director of communications at the NationalHouseware Manufacturers Association, says the product drew alot of attention at the association's show last year and isexpected to be a big seller.   Some consumers may realize, however, that they can makeiced tea in their existing coffee machine.   And Al Hadhazy, an analyst for New Issues, a newsletterthat reviews initial public offerings, warns, &quot;If things slowdown to a crawl and consumers bow out for a while, thisproduct isn't going anywhere.&quot;   But Ian Gittlitz, publisher of Homeworld Business, abi-weekly newspaper on housewares, argues that a slowdown inspending could boost Mr. Coffee's sales. Retailers, lookingfor more bang for their buck in a slow environment, favorrecognized brand names and promotional items, he says.   Mr. Coffee was bought by its current owners from thefounders of the company for $72 million in 1987. Nearly threeyears later, most of that debt remains -- including $35.4million in &quot;junk&quot; bonds on which it must pay interest of16.5%.   When Mr. Coffee pays off two-thirds of its debt, as itintends to do following the offering, $37 million in term andrevolving credit notes will remain. Scheduled repayments ofthe term loan portion of that debt will begin this year.Also, Mr. Coffee will have a negative net tangible book valueof nearly $3 a share.   The existing shareholders paid an average of $7.63 foreach of their shares, with much of that money paid in 1988 tohelp the company out of its cash squeeze.   If the offering is priced in the middle of its offeringrange, those investors will have earned about 30% on theirmoney in almost three years. While that's better than thetotal return of Sandamp;P's 500-Stock Index over the same period,it's hardly a stellar return for a buy-out investor.   Among those selling stock is Quantum Fund N.V., managed byGeorge Soros. Quantum is selling about 29% of the 344,001 Mr.Coffee shares that it owns.   None of the selling shareholders could be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
