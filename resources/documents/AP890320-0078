The court, without comment, let stand rulings that 1985 articlesvillifying each woman in pornographic terms are constitutionallyprotected expressions of opinion.   Peggy Ault, who founded an anti-pornography group in Milwaukie,Ore., and Dorchen Leidholdt, a New Yorker who helped found WomenAgainst Pornography, were the targets of a column published eachmonth in Hustler.   The column, which frequently elicits libel suits from itssubjects, singles out people who oppose the sexually explicitmagazine's views. Carrying an epithet as its title, the columnusually engages in personal attacks as well as criticizing itstargets' views.   Ms. Ault was the column's target in the magazine's April 1985issue; Ms. Leidholdt in the June 1985 edition.   Some of the gentler terms used to describe Ms. Ault included``fanatic,'' ``crackpot,'' ``threatened by sex'' and ``deludedbusybody.''   Ms. Leidholdt's lawsuit charged that the June 1985 column falselydescribed her as ``sexually repressed,'' a person who hates men andherself and suffers from ``bizarre paranoia,'' ``vengefulhysteria,'' and ``demented thinking.''   Ms. Ault sued in federal court in Oregon; Ms. Leidholdt infederal court in Wyoming.   Both suits were dismissed by a trial judge before they reached ajury, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld thedismissals last October.   In Ms. Ault's case, the appeals court said, ``We think it clearthat there is a heated and spirited debate on pornography of whichthis article is a part, in which epithets, fiery rhetoric andhyperbole are expected.''   The appeals court added, ``It is unfortunate that the legalcategory of opinion must be used to describe a statement that is nomore than a vicious slur but base and malignant speech is notnecessarily actionable (libel).''   In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for both women argued thatthe 9th Circuit court rulings unduly expanded the concept of legallyprotected expressions of opinion.   ``What public debate is furthered by this type of assault onpersonal dignity?'' one appeal asked. ``Elevation of such conduct tothe pedestal of protected speech should not be tolerated.''   But lawyers for Flynt and his magazine, in urging that theappeals be rejected, argued that the Constitution protects even``vituperative, pejorative or pernicious opinion.''   The cases are Leidholdt vs. L.F.P. Inc., 88-1214, and Ault v.Hustler Magazine Inc., 88-1215.</TEXT></DOC>
