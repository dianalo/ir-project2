A White House official is renewing the pitch in Tokyo forhelp with the $8 billion-plus physics project to be built inTexas. President Bush will make the issue a top priority whenhe visits Japan next month. Tokyo favors the project inprinciple.   The supercollider, to be completed in 1998, involvesbuilding a 54-mile ring through which protons would whirl andsmash to recreate the forces present at the origin of theuniverse. The project could expand knowledge of matter andenergy. Congress requires one-third of the funding to comefrom non-federal sources. The U.S. expects foreigngovernments to add to the $1 billion from Texas.   The U.S. offered financial support for Japan'sfive-year-old human biology study and indicated enthusiasmfor other projects such as &quot;intelligent manufacturing&quot;systems and advanced computers.                                                                                                          LATIN DEVELOPMENT BOLSTERED                                                                                                          Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela agreed tocontribute to the Multilateral Investment Fund, which wasorganized by the Group of Seven industrial democracies. TheU.S. and Japan have committed $1 billion to the fund, whichunderwrites development of Latin American private markets andbusinesses. The big Latin nations' action at a multinationalgathering in Bangkok &quot;strengthens very substantially theNorth American-Latin American partnership,&quot; a U.S. Treasuryofficial said. Europe hasn't committed any funds.                                                                                                          JAPAN TO SEEK EXPORT RESTRAINT                                                                                                          The head of Japan's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry indicated the agency will ask companies to restraintheir exports, to check the country's growing trade surplus.Eiichi Nakao also appealed again for further easing of creditto help boost weakening domestic demand and buttress Japan'sappetite for imports. Japan's trade surplus for Septembersoared 42% from a year earlier to a record $9.76 billion.                                                                                                          FRANCE ADVANCES LABOR BILL                                                                                                          France's National Assembly advanced tough legislation tocombat illegal immigration and unlawful labor practices. Themeasure is the first step of a government plan announced inJuly to try to control immigration. It provides for jailterms for anyone convicted of helping foreigners illegallyenter, reside and work in France. Employers also could facefines, confiscation of products and suspension of activities.                                                                                                          CHINA PLANS EXPANDED TRADE                                                                                                          Beijing vowed &quot;massive efforts&quot; to increase exports,despite possible U.S. sanctions for alleged protectionism.But China also will open its market wider, using hardcurrency earned from the export drive to buy more foreignproducts, especially advanced technology. Separately, Chinahas begun restoring rail links to Vietnam, in anticipation ofbilateral relations being normalized next month.                                                                                                          PAY CONCESSIONS IN GERMANY                                                                                                          Construction workers in eastern Germany won substantialconcessions on equalizing their depressed wage levels withthose of their western German counterparts. The IG Bau unionand employers agreed that 500,000 workers' pay in the eastwill rise in two steps over the next 18 months to 77% of thatin the west. The ratio now is 65% and IG Bau had sought 85%.Authorities oppose pay parity, saying eastern German wageshave outpaced the region's low productivity and could spurinflation.
