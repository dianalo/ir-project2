There is a concernthat there may be an upper shelf of seismic capacity, primarily for activeequipment, which would render components inoperable if exceeded. Forthis reason, interest has developed in defining the margin above theSafe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE) that exists in operating plants. Whiledefining this margin is a desirable goal, it is much more practical toselect an earthquake level for which survivability is to be demonstratedfor only those systems and components which are required to bring theplant to, and maintain, a safe shutdown condition following the seismicevent. The earthquake level for which survivability is to be demonstratedis commonly referred to as the Seismic Margin Earthquake (SMW). Thisis not a new design earthquake. It is an earthquake for which existingplants may be required to demonstrate survivability. The principal objectiveof this research project was to define such new, practical approachesand criteria that are, for the most part, usable by utility staff toassess their plant for a seismic event larger than the SSE. A furtherobjective was to develop approaches and criteria that are compatiblewith those being developed to resolve other generic safety issues.</TEXT></DOC>
