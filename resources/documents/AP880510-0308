PLC and two big confectioners.   While the rumblings echo familiar patriotic strains, thegovernment says its concerns are strategic, not protectionist.   The BP case, for example, involves the purchase of a major stakein the company by an OPEC member, which could put the interests ofBritish shareholders at risk, the critics say.   They argue that the foreign raids on candy makers Rowntree andCadbury Schweppes are even more of a mismatch because the raidersthemselves are protected against takeover reprisals.   In the BP case, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governmentsaid the Kuwaiti government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake inthe oil giant warranted investigation because the Arab nationbelongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Britain, the world's fifth largest oil producer, is not a memberof the cartel.   The Conservative government has referred the matter to theMonopolies and Mergers Commission to determine whether theacquisition is in the public interest, according to Trade SecretaryLord Young.   The Kuwaiti government's investment office in London maintainsthat its BP stake is a long-term investment, and ``considers it hasalways acted as a model investor in BP.''   It bought the stake piecemeal after the British government soldoff its remaining 31.5 perent share of BP last fall.   Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading, which advises the tradesecretary on whether to call in the monopolies commission, isreviewing two Swiss companies' runs on Kit Kat-maker Rowntree PLC.   Noting that Swiss law protects Nestle S.A. and Jacobs SuchardS.A. from takeovers, critics object to the lack of reciprocity.   Kenneth Clarke, secretary of state for trade and industry, saidin response to a question in the House of Commons on Tuesday thatreciprocity would be a key issue in the review.   ``The points (being) made about fairness are crucial,'' Clarkesaid.   John Banham, director general of the Confederation of BritishIndustry, Britain's largest industry group, added: ``We can'tsafely continue to play football against teams which have builtbrick walls against their own goals and expect to win.''   Swiss food giant Nestle has launched a $2.1 billion pound ($3.95billion) takeover offer for Rowntree and has bought an 11 percentstake in the company. Jacobs Suchard has purchased a 29.9 percentholding in Rowntree, the maximum allowed under British takeoverregulations short of a full takeover bid.   Also at issue is General Cinema Corp.'s purchase of a 17.7percent stake in Cadbury Schweppes PLC. The goverment said Tuesdayit would not go to the monopolies commission, but warned thatChestnut Hill, Mass.-based General Cinema could face furtherscrutiny if it goes ahead with plans to increase its stake.   Critics complain that General Cinema also is ``bid-proof''because some of its shareholders have limited voting rights and thestate of Delaware, where the company is incorporated, has passedanti-takeover legislation.   Young denied the government was becoming protectionist, tellingthe Observer newspaper: ``If we start getting into protectionism,we will be the ones to suffer most.''   While Mrs. Thatcher is a staunch advocate of free marketpolicies and Britain is an enthusiastic foreign investor, itremains generally resistant to foreign investment.   ``This company is a national asset,'' former Rowntree ChairmanSir Donald Barron told applauding shareholders at their annualmeeting late last month. ``It is wrong that it should go to someinanimate place without tradition.''   Nestle Chairman Helmut Maucher came to London this week to meetwith members of Parliament, insisting Rowntree would benefit if itsproducts were marketed through Nestle's worldwide sales network.   Asked by Independent Television News about the reciprocityissue, he admitted that it was ``a barrier to takeover.''   Walter Anderau, a Jacobs Suchard vice president, declined tocomment Tuesday.   The foreign suitors do have backers in Britain. Some workers atRowntree said they believed Nestle offered better job security, andthe conservative Daily Telegraph saw ``no economic justificationfor erecting barriers against foreign ownership of Britishcompanies. And it would be unwise to try and do so at a time whenBritain is taking advantage of a cheap dollar to build upsubstantial investments across the Atlantic.''   On Tuesday, Labor party member Doug Hoyle introduced a proposalwhich would give employees the right to consultation by theiremployer before a takeover. But the bill stands little chance ofbecoming law because of pressure on parliamentary time.</TEXT></DOC>
