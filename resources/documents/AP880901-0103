The latest fatality brought the death toll to 49, said stategovernment spokesman Juergen Dietzen. U.S. officials have said 52people died.   Three fighter jets of the Italian air force precision flyingteam collided Sunday at the air show at the U.S. air base inRamstein. One plane hurtled into the crowd and exploded into flames.   Wednesday night, thousands of mourners marched silently throughthe streets of nearby Kaiserslautern behind a banner memorializingvictims.   By this morning, 165 victims remained hospitalized and 53 peoplewere still missing, the Rhineland-Palatinate state governmentspokesman said.   Dietzen said 34 of the dead have been identified. They includedthree Italian pilots of the stunt team and 31 spectators.   He said most of those identified were West Germans but alsoincluded a French and a Dutch citizen. He didn't know whether anyU.S. citizens were identified.   Base spokeswoman Maj. Kathy White said two Americans were amongthe dead.   Earlier, regional officials said a 4-year-old boy was listed asdead by mistake. They said he was seriously injured.   Hesse state radio said several people had filed criminalcomplaints with local prosecutors against Defense Minister RupertScholz and the air show organizers alleging negligent manslaughter.   The radio did not identify the people or say what connectionthey had to the crash. Under West German law, any citizen can filea criminal complaint against the government, and the governmentmust investigate.   Local prosecutor Wilhelm Sattler already is investigating thedisaster.   West Germany's skies, usually filled with jet fighters andmilitary helicopters, were quieter today, with only private andcommercial aircraft flying. Scholz said the NATO allies would keep``all military aircraft'' on the ground today in a daylong memorial.   About 2,000 people marched through Kaiserslautern, a city 70miles southwest of Frankfurt, in a silent display of grief forvictims of the air show disaster.   Some marchers carried red-and-black banners demanding animmediate halt to all low-level training flights by NATO militaryplanes.   In light of a series of crashes of military jets since March,many West Germans have called for banning or curtailing low-leveltraining flights by planes of their own and a dozen Allied airforces.   One marcher carried a sign reading: ``Will Your Child Be TheNext To Be Maimed?''   Before the march, former Green Party parliament member RolandVogt said, ``There is a better way to promote U.S. and Germanrelations than staging dangerous air shows every single year.''   Wednesday's march was organized by the opposition SocialDemocratic Party, the leftist Greens and church and communitygroups.   The disaster struck Sunday while a team of 10 Italian air forcestunt pilots performed maneuvers above a crowd of about 300,000people.   Some badly burned children still lay unclaimed in hospitalsWednesday, leading officials to fear their parents had been killedin the disaster.   The Air Force at Ramstein released a statement identifying oneAmerican who died as Pfc. Genevieve Riggs, 36, of the 110thMilitary Police Company in Pirmasens, West Germany.   A Ramstein spokesman, Rich Romera, said at least one otherAmerican is known to have died but that the name could not bereleased until relatives are notified.</TEXT></DOC>
