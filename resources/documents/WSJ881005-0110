PaineWebber settled the CFTC's charges by agreeing to pay a $250,000 civil penalty without admitting or denying CFTC allegations that it had defrauded DeRance Inc. of Milwaukee, one of the nation's largest charitable foundations, and that it had failed to supervise the trader, Paul Sarnoff, of Oceanside, N.Y.    The agency charged in its complaint that the value of the DeRance account sank from $8.3 million in February 1983 to a deficit of $3.2 million in December 1984, when the account was liquidated. PaineWebber earned more than $4.1 million in commissions as Mr. Sarnoff, then a vice president in the firm's national commodities office in New York, made thousands of unauthorized trades in gold futures and options on gold futures contracts, the commission said.    The PaineWebber Group Inc. unit made $3.6 million in commissions in 1984, alone, with Mr. Sarnoff's share amounting to $1.2 million, according to the CFTC. An administrative law judge will hold hearings on the charges against Mr. Sarnoff, who retired in July 1986.    The CFTC also charged four former PaineWebber executives with failure to supervise Mr. Sarnoff. Three of them agreed to pay penalties without admitting or denying the charges.    &quot;This controversy is now nearly five years old,&quot; Robert Burson, general counsel of PaineWebber Inc., said yesterday in a statement. &quot;It was our view that if the matter were fully litigated, both PaineWebber and the individual executives -- none of whom had direct responsibility for the account in question -- would have prevailed. However, the cost of pursuing the litigation would far exceed the costs of the settlements and it just made good sense to put this matter behind us.&quot;    In its administrative complaint, the CFTC alleged that Mr. Sarnoff repeatedly disregarded the firm's trading agreement with DeRance.    &quot;Sarnoff consistently liquidated and re-established the same, or similar, positions within a short period of time,&quot; according to the complaint. And as the DeRance account's losses mounted, he stepped up the pace of his trading. In July 1984, he bought and sold the equivalent of 10,000 gold futures contracts, or one million ounces of gold, the agency said.    The CFTC maintained that the firm failed to enforce its own internal prohibitions against trading abuses, and it accused Mr. Sarnoff's four supervisors of failing to investigate reports of heavy trading, large commissions and significant losses in the DeRance account.    The commission cited Steven Krause, former director of the firm's futures division, and Howard Berg, former director of risk management, for allegedly failing to act after they learned that the value of the account had fallen more than $5 million in July 1984.    Mr. Krause of Rye, N.Y., and Mr. Berg of New Canaan, Conn., settled the charges by each paying a $15,000 penalty. A former branch manager, Clarke Young of Greenwich, Conn., agreed to pay a $7,500 penalty. Another former branch manager, Herbert Culpepper of South Kent, Conn., decided to contest the CFTC's failure-to-supervise charge before an administrative law judge.    Mr. Sarnoff declined to comment.    Messrs Krause, Berg and Culpepper couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Young, who agreed to pay a $7,500 penalty, said he &quot;resigned long before the incident happened.&quot; Asked why he agreed to pay the penalty, he said &quot;you have to ask&quot; PaineWebber's attorney. </TEXT></DOC>
