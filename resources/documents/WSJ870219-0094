LevinStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM GMECOMPUTERS (EDP)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp., in a major step that could improve the sometimes-frayed relations with its Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, said EDS signed a five-year, fixed-price contract with GM's financing subsidiary.    Though the value of the contract wasn't specified, it was understood to total about $700 million.    Under the agreement, EDS will be responsible for all data processing, telecommunications and systems development for General Motors Acceptance Corp.'s domestic operations. GMAC provides financing for GM cars, as well as many other financial services.    EDS has been providing many data processing and telecommunications services for GMAC since 1984, when GM acquired EDS. However, EDS has been pressing GM to negotiate and sign long-term, fixed-price contracts for its services. Until recently, GM had been resisting long-term contracts, preferring to work on a year-to-year basis and sometimes on a cost-plus basis.    The dispute between GM and EDS over the contracts was one of several points of contention between Roger B. Smith, GM's chairman, and H. Ross Perot, EDS's founder and former chairman, leading to the $700 million buyout of Mr. Perot's GM Class E stock and his resignation from the company. Mr. Perot had charged that EDS couldn't earn the level of profit it wanted under the GM payment system.    Long-term, fixed-price contracts will improve EDS's earnings prospects and bolster the value of GM Class E stock, analysts have agreed. GM, however, may have to spend more on computer services, though EDS has said it can bring about efficiencies that will justify the cost.    After Mr. Perot left GM, Les Alberthal, EDS's new chairman, told securities analysts he was optimistic that 70% of EDS's contracts with GM would be signed on a long-term, fixed-price basis this year. With the signing of the GMAC contract, EDS has managed to sign 30% of its GM business to long-term contracts, up from about 15% two months ago.    &quot;During 1985 and 1986, the performance levels of computer systems supporting GMAC have improved, even as new systems were added and the volume of data processed rose dramatically,&quot; said Gordon Samardich, GMAC vice chairman. &quot;(EDS's) ability to do the present job well, while continually enhancing and improving our systems capabilities, is why we have committed to EDS.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
