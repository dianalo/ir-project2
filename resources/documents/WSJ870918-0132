When LSI Logic Corp. started in 1980, its founder, British-born Wilfred Corrigan, quickly realized the advantages of raising money outside the U.S. &quot;Global financing has given us more capital and visibility than any other strategy could have,&quot; says Mr. Corrigan.    In the seven years since, the push abroad has allowed the Milpitas, Calif.-based semiconductor maker to become a formidable international company, linking the concern to foreign buyers through overseas units. And it has let the company sell securities on better terms than those available in the U.S.    In the process, LSI has created a model of global financing for smaller concerns -- establishing subsidiaries on several continents, then selling pieces of those units to local investors. The result: LSI has raised more than $400 million in four countries, grown to 2,000 employees from four, and -- despite revenue of only $194.3 million in 1986 -- established a strong multinational presence.    The real accomplishment of LSI's financing is its success in getting high valuations for its subsidiaries from foreign investors, says Harry Fitzgibbons, managing director of Hambros Advanced Technology Trust, and a venture investor in the parent company.    Mr. Fitzgibbons does see some drawbacks. Allocating costs between parent companies and overseas units raises fairness questions, he contends. In addition, growing competition in local markets may make it difficult for the subsidiary to be an attractive public company. Eventually, both the parent company and the investor might be better off if LSI buys back the entire subsidiary, Mr. Fitzgibbons says.    Structurally, LSI sets up separate overseas concerns, then holds a controlling interest in those companies.    Mr. Corrigan, 48 years old, a former chairman and president of Fairchild Camera andamp; Instrument Corp., launched LSI in 1980. That was about a year after he sold Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, to Schlumberger Ltd.    From the start, Mr. Corrigan espoused a &quot;global triad strategy,&quot; to be in three main markets -- Japan, the U.S. and Europe -- with largely independent operations in each. &quot;The companies are linked to each other by technology, money and management, but they steer their own course,&quot; Mr. Corrigan says. That way, each company benefits from technological developments in other markets but is shielded from downturns.    Not everyone in Silicon Valley bought the idea. Many venture capitalists felt that LSI's market niche -- custom microchips -- was too small to guarantee success. Still, Mr. Corrigan's record at Fairchild convinced such top-flight U.S. investors as Kleiner Perkins Caufield andamp; Byers, Sequoia Capital and Institutional Venture Partners to sink almost $7 million -- or the equivalent of 90 cents a share -- into the start-up.    With the initial financing complete, LSI looked abroad in February 1982 for its next infusion. &quot;We decided to go to investors who'd pay a higher price,&quot; explains Mr. Corrigan. At the time, Europeans were clamoring to invest in U.S. high technology and had few opportunities to participate directly in good deals, he says.    &quot;The value of the technology was directly proportionate to the (investor's) distance away from Silicon Valley,&quot; Mr. Corrigan quips. But the analysis is accurate. European venture capitalists, mostly in Britain, put up almost $10 million for LSI stock. That was equal to about $7 a share.    A year later, LSI went public in the U.S., raising $162 million. The timing couldn't have been better for the fledgling company. Technology-hungry investors ponied up $21 a share for the stock, giving LSI a market value of more than $500 million -- 50 times its latest 12-month earnings.    The offering brought LSI to the attention of a new group of international investors: the Japanese. Mr. Corrigan found that a large block of LSI stock was held by Japan's Nomura Securities Co. for Japanese clients. At a subsequent presentation to Nomura's regional managers in Japan, he recognized the opportunity to create a Japanese unit financed by Japanese investors.    In April 1984, LSI sold 30% of the stock in a new Japanese subsidiary to 25 Japanese investors for about $20 million. The roughly $70 million valuation on the Japanese start-up was &quot;extraordinary&quot; by U.S. standards, says George Bischof, a New York investment banker who worked on the deal. But, he adds, the opportunity to invest in a new technology market was too good for Japanese investors to pass up.    For Japanese firms such as Asahi Capital, it was the first opportunity to invest in a U.S. high-technology venture. For others like Nippon Life Insurance Co., which had just begun to participate in U.S. high technology through investments in U.S. venture partnerships, it was a chance to invest directly.    But it wasn't just Japanese capital that LSI wanted. By recruiting Keiske Awata, a senior executive with NEC Corp., the electronics giant, and persuading him to move back to Japan, LSI gave its Japanese start-up instant credibility. It also paved the way for LSI's next financing option: lines of credit from Japanese banks at highly favorable terms.    Japan Development Bank, for example, agreed to a $40 million line of credit for LSI Logic Corp. K.K. and its manufacturing unit, Nihon Semiconductor Inc., at a 6% interest rate. In the U.S. such borrowings could have cost 9% or more. Terms of the Japanese financing were obviously attractive, says Scott Mercer, LSI's chief financial officer. But it also &quot;signaled to our customers and clients that we were a Japanese company.&quot;    Sixty days after creating the Japanese company, LSI was back in Europe -- this time with a new European subsidiary, LSI Logic Ltd. In a private offering managed by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., LSI sold 18% of its European unit for about $13 million. The price valued the new unit at about $72 million -- far higher than the valuation U.S. investors would have placed on a similar start-up.    But the price didn't deter investors. Indeed, powerful European investors including London-based Investors in Industry, Sulzer Brothers Ltd. of Switzerland and WFG Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Wagniskapital -- the venture capital arm of five major West German banks -- helped launch the new company in a hurry.    Again, more than money was at stake. As a European company financed by European investors, &quot;We have a credibility we wouldn't have had as the branch of a Silicon Valley company,&quot; says Robert Blair, president of the European unit. More important, he says, &quot;Our customers want to deal with a company which is locally based and which makes decisions locally.&quot;    With almost $200 million of equity raised globally, Mr. Corrigan had his triad strategy in place by mid-1984. It was almost a year and a half before the company went back to its global markets for more capital.    In December 1985, Swiss Bank Corp. helped LSI raise $23 million through an offering of convertible bonds. The financing was an easy one, Mr. Mercer of LSI says, but the timing was a concern. &quot;We didn't want to go back to the same well too soon,&quot; he says.    This year, LSI raised an additional $125 million in an offering to European investors. The bonds, which pay a 6.25% rate and are convertible to common stock at a 25% premium, were sold through Morgan Stanley and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding.    By selling the bonds in Europe, LSI was able to raise money faster than it could have in the U.S. It didn't have the delays involved in dealing with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, says Carter McClelland, a Morgan Stanley investment banker. Also, &quot;We got a good price,&quot; when similar offerings in the U.S. had to offer higher rates of interest and lower premiums, he adds.    Two weeks after the European bond offering, LSI Logic sold almost 16% of its Canadian unit for $23 million in a public stock sale. The initial offering price of about $5.50 a share gave the 18-month-old subsidiary market value of about $140 million -- a robust value equal to more than 11 times its 1986 revenue.    Foreign operations financed through local stock offerings also help the units borrow, Mr. Mercer says, because foreign banks are more willing to lend against a company's local equity base than against that of the parent. Still, LSI's cash balances -- acquired mainly from its equity offerings -- at the end of last year exceeded the $26 million line of credit it had available with foreign banks.    &quot;It's much easier to let each unit handle its own accounts in its own currency than to have to manage them all from here,&quot; Mr. Mercer says.    ---   Mr. Gupta reports on venture capital from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                How LSI Reached the Big Time    November 1980     LSI Logic Corp. begins in Milpitas,                      Calif.
