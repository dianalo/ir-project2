The vote was 327-92.   House and Senate negotiators, in an all-night session last week,set up a program for overseas arms sales that will provide $3.8billion in outright grants and $410 million in loans made onfavorable terms during the fiscal year that begins Saturday.   The agreement also retained the current Military AssistanceProgram, with grants in fiscal 1989 totaling $467 million.   As ususal, the largest recipients of military and economic aidare Israel and Egypt, which receive hefty support because of their1979 peace treaty. Israel would get $1.2 billion in economic and$1.8 billion in military assistance, while Egypt would get $815million in economic aid and $1.2 billion in military aid. All ofthe military aid for both would be in the form of grants.   The foreign aid bill has been remarkably without controversythis year, in part because of last year's agreement between theReagan administration and Congress that smoothed the way for theyear's money bills.   If given final Senate approval and sent to President Reagan, itwould be the first time in seven years that a separate foreign aidbill has been approved. Usually, the measure has been rolled intocatch-all spending bills in Congress' rush to adjourn. The Reaganadministration has indicated its support for this year's compromisemeasure.   In one provision that briefly threatened to undo the compromise,the bill would provide $50 million as the first of six yearlyinstallments toward recapitalizing the World Bank, which makesloans to developing countries.   House members had objected to the provision on Wednesday,delaying the measure by a day. Opponents argue that increasingloans to third-world countries without first demanding economicreforms is counterproductive, and some conservatives oppose thebank because they say it makes loans to communist countries. Butthe money ultimately was left in the bill as part of the overallcompromise on a vote of 303-90.   Among other provisions in the bill:   _ $2 million for internal opposition parties in Nicaragua, to beprovided through the National Endowment for Democracy. The moneycannot go to any group that supports the Contra rebels or otherarmed opponents of the leftist Sandinistat regime. The amount is anincrease from this year's $800,000, and is to go for unionorganizing, buying supplies for opposition media and politicaltraining.   _ $101 million for international narcotics control programs runby the State Department, a $2 million increase from the currentfiscal year. The increase is to fund drug eradication andinterdiction efforts, particularly aerial herbicide spraying ofcoca plants.   _ $35 million for Jamaica, for use in recovery from damagecaused by Hurricane Gilbert earlier this month.   Other major aid allocations include the Philippines, which wouldget $125 million in military aid, $124 million in economic aid and$40 million for development; an African development fund, whichwould get $500 million; $500 million in military aid and $60million in economic aid for Turkey; and $350 million in militaryaid for Greece.   In Central America, El Salvador would receive $185 million ineconomic support, Guatemala $80 million, Costa Rica $90 million,and Honduras $85 million. Guatemala also would get $9 million in``non-lethal'' military support to help its civilian governmenteliminate human rights abuses and assert control over the military.The bill also would continue bans on aid to Panama and Haiti.   The bill includes $215 million in economic and $230 million inmilitary aid for Pakistan; $43 million to aid Afghan refugees; $2million for the Polish trade union Solidarity; at least $10 millionfor Ireland; $30 million in military aid and $11 million ineconomic aid for Tunisia; and $50 million in economic aid forPortugal.</TEXT></DOC>
