The 30-foot-by-30-foot, 1,320-pound Amos satellite will haveabout half the capability of most Western communications satellitesand will function for 10 years, said Phil Herman, a spokesman forthe government-owned Israel Aircraft Industries. It has no militaryapplications, he said.   Israel plans to launch two Amos communications satellites in1993 and will offer to sell it to foreign countries orcorporations. The launch will be carried out by the EuropeanArianne space consortium.   ``The satellite is designed for developing countries and verylarge corporations that need a dedicated satellite for their ownpurposes,'' Herman said.   In September 1988, Israel launched its first space satellite,Horizon-1, which remained in orbit for almost four months. It waslaunched on an Israeli missile and was used for scientific research.</TEXT></DOC>
