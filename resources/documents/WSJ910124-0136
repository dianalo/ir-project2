In composite Big Board trading,Ameritech dropped $1.625 to $63.375; BellSouth Corp. slipped$1.25 to $51.875; Pacific Telesis Group fell $1.50 to $39.75;Bell Atlantic Corp. declined $2.375 to $47.625; U S West Inc.fell $1.375 to $35.625. Only Nynex, which is expected toannounce earnings today, held its own, falling a moderate 50cents to $67.75. GTE Corp., the largest independent phonecompany, was also down, falling 75 cents to $28.   For the quarter, Southwestern Bell reported earnings of$267.5 million, or 89 cents a share, including charges of $45million, or 15 cents a share. The charges related towork-force reduction programs, including a voluntary planthat more than 1,100 managers accepted, and a consolidationin its telephone unit's comptroller organization. In the 1989fourth quarter, Southwestern Bell reported net income of$297.2 million, or 99 cents a share. Revenues during thelatest quarter rose 5.3% to $2.45 billion from $2.32 billionthe year before.   During the quarter, the company added 15,000 access lines,a sharp drop from the record 130,000 access lines added inthe third quarter and the 110,000 access lines added in1989's fourth quarter.   Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., loweredhis ratings on Southwestern Bell as well as BellSouth andAmeritech. &quot;The bottom line here is that these regional Bellsare seeing widespread weakness in their telephone operationsdriven by a weak economy,&quot; he said. Mr. Grubman predictedthat the Baby Bells will lose the premium for stability thatinvestors have accorded their stocks. Moreover, he said, theBells aren't likely to snap back the moment the economystrengthens because access line growth generally trails byabout six months.   The phone companies &quot;didn't believe the economy was goingto drop as much as it did in the fourth quarter,&quot; said JoelGross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp. He predicted &quot;two more quarters of flattishearnings before the Baby Bells resume their normal 5, 6, 7%growth rate,&quot; because it will take at least that long beforemanagement can curb spending and take other steps to copewith the weak economy.   Susan B. Fox, managing director, investor relations forSouthwestern Bell, said the stock was &quot;caught in thebackwash&quot; of the Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlanticannouncements. Unlike many analysts, Southwestern doesn'tforesee a cheerless 1991. Ms. Fox said the company expects&quot;strong access line growth.&quot; In addition, she said theeconomy continues to grow within Southwestern's five-stateregion, and that growth in the cellular business remainsrobust. Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, servesArkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.   During 1990, Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems added284,000 customers, bringing its total to 667,000 customers in24 markets. About 92,000 customers were added in the fourthquarter, Mobile Systems' strongest quarterly increase ever.   For the Bells, which were created in the 1984 breakup ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., this is their firstrecession as independent companies. Before the Bells beganreporting fourth-quarter earnings -- beginning with Ameritechlast week -- investors seemed to believe the group couldslide through the downturn with only modest declines ingrowth.   For the year, Southwestern Bell's net income inched upabout 1% to $1.10 billion, or $3.67 a share, from $1.09billion, or $3.64, in the 1989 period. Revenue increased 4.4%to $9.1 billion from $8.7 billion the year earlier.   Southwestern Bell Chairman Edward Whitacre noted thatwithout the one-time charges in the fourth quarter, thecompany's 1990 net income would have grown 5%. &quot;Looking aheadto the rest of 1991,&quot; he said, &quot;we're concerned about theweakening economy. However, we feel the company is wellpositioned to withstand a downturn.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
