And Louisiana Bayou Oil Corporation (collectivelyreferred to as Mutual) filed a Motion for Discovery and Motion for EvidentiaryHearing in connection with their Statements of Objections to the ProposedRemedial Order (PRO) which the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)issued to Mutual on September 8, 1986. The DOE denied Mutual's requestfor contemporaneous construction and administrative record discovery concerning10 CFR 212.186 (the layering regulation), 205.202 (the anti-circumventionregulation) and 210.62(c) (the normal business practice rule), citing numerousprecedents for the denial of these requests. The DOE also denied Mutual'srequests for discovery concerning clarification of the PRO, finding thatthe ERA's pleadings and workpapers already supplied to Mutual were sufficientfor the companies to understand the allegations against them and to respondto the disputed issues in the case. Furthermore, the DOE found that someof Mutual's requests were not relevant to Mutual's arguments presentedin the companies' Statements of Objections. The DOE granted Mutual 30 daysin which to provide alternative matching for the ERA's matching of MPM's1977 transactions concering MPM's alleged Subpart F violations.

Algona is a regulated public utility that claimed a refundbased on its purchases of 6,993,551 gallons of petroleum products. TheOHA has regarded refund applications filed by utility firms as claims filedon behalf of utility customers. Thus, to the extent that utility customerswere end-users of petroleum products, the OHA has applied the end-userpresumption of injury to claims filed by public utilities. Based on thispolicy, the OHA granted Algona's refund request, with the condition thatAlgona pass through the refund to its customers. The total amount of refundapproved in this Decision and Order is $1,399.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A. Inc./Christian County Gas Company, RF139-37; L.H.

Although Genico didnot attempt to demonstrate injury on its distillate purchases, the DOEalso granted it a refund on those purchases because the firm's combinedprincipal refund amount fell below the $5,000 small claims threshold. Thetotal refund granted to Genico was $6,256, representing $4,344 in principaland $1,912 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gulf Oil Corporation/Ryder System, Inc., 5/18/88, RF40-1823</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Ryder System, Inc., the parent company of Ryder Truck Rental,Inc.
