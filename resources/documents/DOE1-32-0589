The enzyme is a serineprotease which converts an inactive zymogen, plasminogen to plasmin,and causes lysis of fibrin clots. The high affinity of TPA for fibrinindicates that it is a potential thrombolytic agent and is superior tourokinase-like plasminogen activators. Recently, TPA has been clonedand expressed in E. coli. Using TPA as a model protein, the authors reporthere the development of a direct, sensitive enzyme-immunoassay for thescreening of a cDNA expression library using specific antibodies andperoxidase-labeled second antibody.</TEXT></DOC>
