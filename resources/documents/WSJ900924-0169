As the Tokyo Stock Exchange sinks, the pubs and noodleshops around Kabutocho, the stock market district, havebuzzed with worried talk of a shakeout in Japan'sonce-prosperous securities industry.</LP><TEXT>   With stock prices down 40% in the past nine months andtrading volume down by nearly two-thirds, Japan's brokershave good reason to be nervous.   The first clear signs that the market's reversal has takenits toll on the Japanese securities industry surfaced twoweeks ago. Japan's Big Four -- Nomura Securities Co., DaiwaSecurities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi SecuritiesCo. -- drastically cut pretax earnings projections for thehalf-year ending Sept. 30.   Nomura said pretax profit would drop almost 50% to 125billion yen ($908.1 million) in the first half. At Daiwa,officials projected a 62% decline, while Nikko and Yamaichisaid earnings would plunge 73% and almost 75%, respectively.The projected profits are about a third of what the firmspreviously estimated. Pretax earnings are the clearestindication of the firms' operating results.   At the moment, few worry that the Big Four are in seriousdifficulty. Although it's also not clear sailing for thefour: On Friday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it now has anegative long-term outlook for the big securities companies,but added that it won't necessarily lower the houses'ratings. Sandamp;P said its new opinion reflects sharply lowerearnings expectations and uncertainty about when and how longany rebound would last, but said the four maintain goodfinancial positions.   But at midsized securities firms, which have high fixedcosts and rely more heavily on equity brokerage commissions,the shock of a suddenly depressed market is proving harder towithstand. Many of the second-tier securities houses areprojecting midterm earnings declines of more than 75%.Midsized brokerages -- many of which were in the middle ofexpanding operations -- will have trouble shrugging off thosedeclines.   &quot;The big brokers can take a hit more easily,&quot; says StuartMatthews, a financial analyst at Barclays de Zoete WeddSecurities Ltd. &quot;Medium-sized firms aren't as diversified, sowhen revenue from commissions dries up there isn't much forthem to fall back on.&quot;   The plight of Japan's midsized firms may be bestillustrated by difficulties faced in recent days by SanyoSecurities Co., Japan's only major family-run brokeragehouse.   Just a few years ago, the firm was flying high. Buoyed bysoaring stock prices, Sanyo -- Japan's eighth-largestsecurities company in terms of revenue and trading volume --racked up record profits. With Tokyo stocks climbing into thestratosphere, Sanyo's ambitious young president, YoichiroTsuchiya, decided the time was right for a bid to join theranks of the major securities houses. He pushed Sanyo, whichis 12.8%-owned by company controlled by Nomura Securities,into new types of trading, such as warrants and futures,increased staff by more than a third and significantlyexpanded international operations.   The centerpeice of Mr. Tsuchiya's bold vision for Sanyo'sfuture was an eight billion yen trading center replete withgiant wall-to-wall electronic display boards, lightning-fastcomputers and a daunting array of gee-whiz telecommunicationsequipment.   Mr. Tsuchiya -- who declined requests for an interview --told a monthly magazine soon after the center was opened thathe felt the trading center was necessary to bolster theconfidence of his sales force. &quot;When a strong tailwind isblowing, victory goes to the boat with the biggest sail,&quot; hewas quoted as saying.   But Mr. Tsuchiya's strategy may have run aground. Earlierthis month, the market was abuzz with unsubstantiated reportsthat Sanyo was about to lose as much as 50 billion yen in thefutures market. Other rumors suggested that Sanyo was indanger of losing billions of yen from its holdings ofcommercial paper issued by a recently failed New Zealandinvestment bank. Reports about Sanyo's position in thefutures market appear to have been false. The contracts weresaid to expire Sept. 13, but that deadline passed withoutnoticeable interruption of Sanyo's business.   Sanyo officials confirm, however, that the firm holds $90million in commercial paper issued by DFC New Zealand Ltd., aformerly state-owned investment bank that floundered afterbeing privatized. But while acknowledging that they haven'tbeen able to collect on the loans -- which came due inOctober 1989 -- Sanyo officials say they still believe thefirm will get most of its money back. &quot;The conclusion on thismatter has yet to be drawn,&quot; said a Sanyo spokesman. &quot;Wearen't worried about this at all,&quot; he added, &quot;because it isan issue with the New Zealand government.&quot;   As if the talk about Sanyo isn't bad enough, some tradershave begun whispering that Sanyo's trading operations aresinking -- not financially, but physically. Rumors have itthat Sanyo's giant trading floor, erected on a swath ofreclaimed land along the Tokyo waterfront, is slowly recedinginto the muck. Sanyo officials say the reports arepreposterous.   If Sanyo or any other securities firms are reallyfloundering, it is doubtful that Japan's financialauthorities would let them drown. When Yamaichi Securitiesteetered on the brink of collapse in 1965, officials at theBank of Japan intervened to pump it full of emergency funds.Many here think regulators at the central bank and theMinistry of Finance remain ready to rescue the nation'ssecurities institutions before they fail.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Tokyo stock prices rebounded strongly from midday lows inthe last hour of the session Friday, posting the first dailygain in seven trading days.
