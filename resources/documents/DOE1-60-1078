The potential of biomagnetic separation technology, genetic engineeringand monoclonal antibody technology was also examined. It appeared thatthe most appropriate technologies to develop for radionuclide removalin the short term were based on biosorptions of radionuclides by biomassand modified and unmodified biopolymers.</TEXT></DOC>
