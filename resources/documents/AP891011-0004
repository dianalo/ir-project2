Manuel Antonio Noriega accusedthe United States on Wednesday of trying to keep its forces inPanama to maintain control over Latin America.   The widow of the Panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coupagainst Noriega says it failed because her husband was betrayed byanother major who switched sides at the last minute, according to apublished report.   Noriega, who blamed last week's coup attempt on the UnitedStates, said Panama must be prepared ``because they cannot catch usby surprise again, and even if the commander (Noriega) falls, thepeople will not fall.''   Countering what U.S. officials have been saying, Adela Bonillade Giroldi was quoted by the New York Times in Thursday's editionsas saying the coup was ``very well organized and coldlycalculated.''   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, worked with Maj.Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, inplanning the coup.   Instead of being used to oust Noriega, however, Battalion 2000was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and ledNoriega's troops in crushing the coup.   ``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's gameand he failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she toldthe Times in an interview in Miami.   Mrs. Giroldi was not at military headquarters during the coupattempt on Oct. 3 and her information came from officers who tookpart in the coup and, as she did, fled shortly afterwards to theUnited States, the Times said.   Noriega spoke in Panama City at the People's Power assembly.Before he addressed the crowd, he introduced Sarah York, 11, aNegaunee, Mich., girl on her second trip to Panama at Noriega'sinvitation.   ``She represents the truth of the American people, purity andnot hatred,'' he said as he brought his young pen pal to the podiumto wave to the crowd.   The assembly is comprised of precinct representatives appointedby the government to act as a legislative body. It replaces theNational Assembly, which was abolished when the provisionalgovernment of President Francisco Rodriguez took office on Sept. 1.   The government annulled May 7 elections, which foreign observerssay the opposition won by a 3-1 margin.   Noriega, who commands the Defense Forces and controls thegovernment, said Washington's intention was not just to eliminatehim, ``but to install in power the enemies of the people.''   Rodriguez spoke after Noriega. He called for reconciliation andsaid his government was open to dialogue.   On Tuesday, the government announced tough new measures aimed atsuppressing dissent, firing public employees considered to bedisloyal, freezing wages and suspending year-end bonuses.   Members of the assembly demanded dismissal of ``seditious''elements still working for the government.   But Rodriguez, who was frequently rumored to have opposed thelaws during Cabinet meetings, said the measures should not be usedfor personal revenge.   ``The preservation of the country as our home is and must be theparamount goal of our government,'' Rodriguez said.   Opposition leaders and members of professional associationsexpressed concern over impact of the new laws, which the governmentsaid were meant to ``protect the economy and national security inthe face of U.S. aggression.''   ``It is the first step in the creation of a police state,''Christian Democratic Party leader Ricardo Arias Calderon told TheAssociated Press.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said inWashington Wednesday that Panama was decreeing a ``package of warlaws'' as part of an effort to ``eliminate the last vestiges ofdemocracy and rule of law.''   Panama blames Washington for its troubles. The U.S. governmentimposed economic sanctions on Panama after Noriega was indicted inFebruary 1988 on U.S. drug charges. He denies the charges.   Wednesday was the 21st anniversary of the military coup thatbrought to power the late Omar Torrijos, the man Noriega considershis political and ideological mentor.   The coup deposed President Arnulfo Arias 11 days after Ariastook office. Torrijos banned political parties, exiled scores ofpoliticians and ruled with the help of a People's Assembly insteadof Congress.   Torrijos signed treaties with President Carter that committedthe United States to a new relationship with Panama.   The United States gave up its territory in the Canal Zone in1979. Under the treaties, the United States must close its Panamabases at the end of the century, when Panama will take over theCanal's administration.</TEXT></DOC>
