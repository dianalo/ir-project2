But it's starting to look as if they left junk-bond investors holding the bag.    Nearly two years after its $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out, the company's big chain of 7-Eleven stores should by now have been in pretty good shape, according to the Thompsons' earlier rosy forecasts. Instead, Southland is showing signs of increasing strain. To stay afloat, it has had to keep borrowing money and selling assets, spurring talk among some investment bankers that it might have to restructure its big debts.    The Southland saga shows that leverage can hurt even so-called ideal LBO candidates. Convenience stores were thought to have dependable businesses that could support big debts. But Southland's cash flow &quot;hasn't proven so stable,&quot; says Frank Colombo, who runs Dillon Read's junk-bond research.    In 1989's first half, sales actually fell at Southland's 7-Elevens, after subtracting inflation, and profit margins shrank. The 7-Elevens are said to have fared poorly even in July and August, peak summer months. And Southland's operations in 1989 won't produce enough cash flow even to pay its $448 million cash interest bill, let alone a $258 million bank payment due in December. Long-term debt stands at about $3.7 billion.    The Thompsons now are trying to buy time by selling Southland's crown jewels, mainly its 50% stake in Citgo, a refinery. Meanwhile, to tide it over, the company has a $450 million revolving credit from banks. Southland says it's in good standing with its banks.    But in recent weeks, panicky holders of Southland's $1.5 billion of high-yield junk bonds have slashed prices of some Southland issues by one-fifth, to 56 cents to 75 cents on the dollar. All Southland's bonds now yield more than 24%, while some debt of Safeway, considered a solid credit, yields only 11.5%.    Some Southland bonds might have further to fall, says Mariel Clemensen, who runs Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette's junkbond research. If Southland keeps selling businesses to service debt, she says, there won't be enough assets left to protect all bondholders. Already, Southland has sold almost 1,000 of its 8,000 stores.    Southland's problem is typical of more and more LBOs: too much debt. Says Dillon Read analyst Evan Mann, &quot;The Thompsons wanted to keep the family company, so they overpaid.&quot; To evade Canadian raider Sam Belzberg, the Thompsons took Southland private in 1987 at high, pre-crash prices.    After the crash, underwriters Goldman Sachs and Salomon had trouble selling Southland bonds. But the Thompsons, bigwigs in Dallas, convinced investors that growing profit margins and asset sales would bail Southland out of its debts.    That hasn't happened, partly because oil companies are invading the convenience-store business. &quot;We don't see any lessening of competitive conditions,&quot; says Markeeta McNatt, Southland's investor relations officer. But she says Southland is doing better than other independent chains and is &quot;in a good strategic position.&quot;    The Thompsons won't be immune if Southland falters. But they're much better off than the company's bondholders.    In the buy-out of Southland, the Thompsons got $350 million in cash and securities for their original 9% Southland stake. The Thompsons put back $200 million of equity into the LBO, but later sold $50 million of that stake. With the Thompsons at the helm, Southland started out in the 1920s selling bread and milk at its ice stores.    In today's more skeptical market, investors say the Thompsons' deal wouldn't get done. Circle K, the No. 2 convenience-store chain, is currently having trouble raising money for a planned buy-out.    Only a year after its LBO, Southland refinanced a big chunk of debt, but the exchange offer proved to be only a Band-Aid. Now, bears think the company might need major surgery.    To cut bank debt, Southland last May put on the block some assets it wanted to keep, including its Citgo stake, which has given it an edge over other independent chains. But even after Citgo is sold, analysts say Southland won't be out of the woods.    The 50% stake in Citgo, jointly owned with Venezuela, has been valued as high as $700 million. But some say Citgo won't fetch top prices; Southland is said to have recently turned down an offer closer to $500 million. Southland won't confirm that. Unless Southland sells more assets after Citgo, Dillon Read estimates it will face cash shortfalls of $89 million in 1990, $271 million in 1991 and $485 million in 1992. Southland thinks those numbers are a bit high.    Some people say Southland is getting a raw deal from investors. They say the company will be shipshape after selling its Citgo stake, perhaps by year end. Southland's food processing and distribution units also are up for sale, though one investment banker says they might be a tough sell at high prices.    Proceeds from these asset sales would make a big dent in Southland's $1.6 billion of bank debt. Often, when companies announce asset sales, their bonds trade higher, if only briefly. Some speculators think Southland's junior bonds and preferred shares are worth a gamble. The preferred was at 7 3/8 yesterday, down from a 12-month high of 12 3/8. But with junk investors jittery these days, it's hard to trade in and out of the market. Earlier this year, bonds of debt-laden Interco cratered when investors tried to get out.    Compounding Southland's problems, the Thompsons haven't been great merchandisers, analysts say. Southland's advertising costs are at an all-time high, yet sales and profit margins aren't growing. Until recently, Southland was pushing low-margin products such as beer and cigarettes, though it now is promoting hot dogs and sandwiches, which have fatter profit margins.    Southland also has a $475 million office complex in Dallas to worry about. Cityplace Center, with only one tenant besides Southland, is said to cost about $50 million a year to run. &quot;It's a white elephant,&quot; says one investment banker.    ---   Don't judge advice by its price.    Investors often wonder if the expensive investment newsletters give better advice than the cheap ones. The answer is no, judging by some recent findings of Mark Hulbert, whose Hulbert Financial Digest is an official scorer of sorts for the market-letter industry.    Mr. Hulbert divided the newsletters he has tracked for nine years into two groups: the 50% with the better records during that time, and the 50% with the poorer records. Average subscription price of the more successful group was $194. Average price for the laggards: a costlier $212.    --John R. Dorfman </TEXT></DOC>
