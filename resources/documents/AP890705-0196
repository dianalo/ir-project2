STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Daimler-Benz, already West Germany'sNo. 1 company, is pushing for a merger with an aerospace giant thatwould make the conglomerate a major global force in weapons salesand aviation technology.   But the proposed merger, the largest and one of the mostcontroversial in the nation's 40-year history, has run into seriousobjections.   They have ranged from fears of stifled competition to concernthat the resulting defense colossus could end up dictating its ownterms to the government.   After a veto from the federal cartel office, Economics MinisterHelmut Haussmann must decide whether to override the veto and standsat the center of what could become one of the most politicallydivisive debates of the year.   Haussmann, whose predecessor helped engineer the proposed deal,has promised a decision by September.   If Daimler is allowed to merge with theMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB) group, Germany's largest defensecontractor, the reach of the conglomerate would be immense.   Daimler-Benz already is a leader in making luxury cars and sturdytrucks, which officials say will still be a large and vital part ofits operations.   The merger would create a giant with yearly revenues of almost 80billion marks (about $42 billion). The conglomerate would rank amongthe top 15 aerospace and defense contractors worldwide.   The conglomerate would have vast holdings in weaponry and defenseelectronics, including military aircraft, missiles, engines, tanksand small naval ships _ areas that Daimler officials believe havemore growth potential than cars and trucks.   The cartel office in April rejected the proposal on grounds thatit would give Daimler a dominant position in the defense, aerospaceand truck-manufacturing sectors. It also feared the conglomerate'sresulting political clout.   ``There is a danger that in the long-term Daimler could become sopowerful that it could pressure the government for futureconcessions,'' said Hubertus Schoen, a spokesman for the WestBerlin-based cartel office.   ``Economic power can easily become political power,'' Schoensaid, referring to fears that, with so many defense jobs tied to thecompany, it would be hard for the government to turn down lucrativecontracts.   Schoen said the conglomerate could push smaller companies out ofthe running for defense-related contracts.   Daimler-Benz officials contend those fears are misguided.   ``We expect the merger to create new outlets for thousands ofsuppliers,'' said Friedrich Loesch, a spokesman for theStuttgart-based company.   Daimler officials are quick to note that it was the governmentthat came to them with the merger proposal nearly two years ago. Thegovernment hopes the deal will ease Bonn's share of the subsidyburden in Europe's loss-plagued Airbus Industrie consortium, whichmanufacturers commercial jets.   MBB, which is currently 52 percent owned by the states ofBavaria, Bremen and Hamburg, holds West Germany's 37.9 percent stakein the Airbus venture.   Under terms of the Daimler-MBB proposal, the government's onlyinvolvement in the Airbus program after the year 2000 would be inproviding funds for research and development, saving it millions infuture subsidies.   Economics Ministry officials say that despite Bonn's pledge topay subsidies to equal losses from currency fluctuations until theturn of the century, the gains of privatizing the program areenormous in the long term.   Daimler officials say the merger will make West Germany morecompetitive in international aerospace research and production.   ``The West German aviation and aerospace industry is now just toofragmented to compete well on the international market,'' Loeschsaid.   Combined with Daimler-Benz's existing operations in aviation andaerospace, the merger would give the auto and truck maker control ofabout 60 percent of West Germany's aerospace industry.   The deal, which initially calls for Daimler-Benz to take a 30percent interest in MBB, is currently under final review by thefederal monopolies commission. The commission is expected to deliverits report to the Economic's Ministry in August.   Economic Minister Haussmann can override the vetoes of bothagencies if he determines that the merger is in West Germany's``overriding national economic interest.''   Although government funded, both agencies fulfill independentwatchdog functions.   Haussmann is under growing pressure to uphold the cartel officeban, both from within the ruling conservative parties and from theopposition parties.   Ulrich Immenga, chairman of the Cologne-based monopoliescommission, acknowledges that Haussmann is in an uncomfortableposition.   ``The commission will address the awkwardness for the economicsminister in its report,'' Immenga said, referring to charges thatthe ministry's decision could be skewed in favor of the mergerbecause it once helped author the proposal.   While Haussmann has said his final decision will be based onobjective review of all aspects of the proposal, one of theminister's top-ranking officials has already irritated members ofthe commission and the cartel office by saying publicly that thenegative ruling would likely be set aside.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday July 9</NOTE></DOC>
