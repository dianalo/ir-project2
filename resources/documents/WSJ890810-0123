The reservationholder points to an entry in the Michelin Guide indicating that this establishment does too take the American Express Co. card, but the clerk insists.    As the would-be guest requests a taxi and the name of another hotel, the manager approaches. &quot;All right, we'll take the card for the hotel room,&quot; he says, taking a packet of charge forms out of a locked cabinet. &quot;But if you want to eat here, you'll have to pay cash.&quot;    So it goes for American Express cardholders in Italy. Their motto might well be: Better to leave home without it. Whether traveling to provincial tourist haunts or having business lunches at chic spots in Milan, paying with American Express -- even when the symbol is displayed outside -- is hit or miss.    &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; says the manager of a pricey Milan restaurant as embarrassed diners fish in their pockets for cash to cover the bill. &quot;We can't accept the card, you see, because they take a huge commission -- something like 15%. Then it can take months to get our money. With two-thirds of our clients using American Express, we were going broke.&quot;    American Express Co. acknowledges that it has a problem. &quot;It's true&quot; that there is resistance to the card, says Isabella di Montezemolo, the company's head of public affairs for Italy. Tommaso Zanzotto, president of American Express Travel-Related Services International, concedes that Italy is &quot;a little behind in terms of the plastic revolution&quot; and says there &quot;may be a couple of isolated incidents&quot; where merchants refuse to accept the American Express card, but he denies the company has major problems there. He cites a late 1987 survey of Italian cardholders in which 98.2% said they were satisfied with the service they received.    Mr. Zanzotto says he expects Italians to significantly increase credit-card use in the next four or five years; so far, only three million cards are spread among Italy's 57 million citizens, and plastic is used for only 1% of all transactions. In Spain, seven million credit cards are in circulation; in France and Britain, 20 million each; and in the U.S., 220 million. But, with exchange controls to be dropped next year and Italians getting richer, the numbers are growing.    &quot;Italian banks are beginning to realize that consumer credit of all kinds can be a cash cow,&quot; says Maurizio Mussati, financial services consultant for Booz-Allen Italia. Spurred on by competition from foreign rivals like Citibank, Italian banks are starting to promote credit cards and other consumer services.    The potential for growth is there, agrees Patrick Frazer, director of research at the Lafferty Group, a London firm that follows the credit-card industry. But he adds that American Express is hardly assured of success. American Express charges a higher fee than other cards, he says, and &quot;they have a bad reputation as a slow payer&quot; to businesses.    Credit-card companies are cagey about disclosing their commissions, but American Express's range of fees doesn't go much higher than 6%, says Ms. di Montezemolo, the spokeswoman. She says a small leather-goods shop would pay a higher commission than a big hotel or an airline doing a large volume of business. But she scoffs at the Milan restaurateur's 15% estimate as far off base. Analysts and banking sources say most other cards charge 2% to 4%.    Visa's Italian franchise is owned by Banca d'America andamp; d'Italia, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG. Shopkeepers who accept Visa can take their credit vouchers to one of BAI's more than 100 branches, most of which are in large and medium-sized cities in northern and central Italy, and have the money transferred to their accounts immediately (which in Italy takes three or four days).    American Express lacks a bank network and therefore requires shopkeepers to mail their vouchers to Rome headquarters for processing. In inefficient Italy, that adds an average of eight business days -- each way -- to the payment system. But that is expected to change soon, because BAI has agreed to start paying American Express vouchers at its branches as well.    Visa's bank-linked payments and lower fees made it Italy's most widely distributed credit card until recently. In 1986, a consortium of Italian banks launched Carta Si, a credit card that now claims 32.4% of the market, compared with Visa's 27.2% and American Express's 17.8%. Carta Si is offered by 500 Italian banks, and some 1.2 million Italians have it. That compares with 1.1 million who hold Visa, 500,000 with American Express and 150,000 with Diner's Club, banking sources say.    American Express likes to say that its cardholders are bigger spenders than holders of Visa or bank cards. American Express cards have higher credit limits and are often provided by the cardholders' employers for business expenses.    Part of the reason for American Express's limited acceptance in Italy reflects the way the retail market works, analysts say. In Italy, supermarket, hotel and department-store chains are still underdeveloped. Most purchases are in small, family-owned shops. These are the least likely to accept credit cards -- they prefer to bargain with individual clients, for cash.    Italy's few big chains, such as the department store La Rinascente, owned by Fiat S.p.A., don't create problems when confronted with an American Express card. Nor, for the most part, do fancy shops, although a Milan boutique called Carducci 38 notes that during sales it reduces its discount for those paying with plastic to 35% from the customary 40%. Most other such shops either insist on cash or make credit card users pay full price.    And at places like China Town, an inexpensive Chinese restaurant in Rome, it's more than likely that the waiter will return with a client's credit card, politely saying, &quot;We ran out of charge forms for American Express. Don't you have another credit card -- Visa? Mastercard? Carta Si?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
