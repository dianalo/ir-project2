that system isspeaker-dependent, but Kavner also showed off a speaker-independent speechrecognition system with the same set of hardware plus a telephone - thedemonstrator phoned in and an electronic operator asked him to choose betweencollect, calling card or information, and was able to be understood when hesaid &quot;I would like to make a collect call;&quot; the system repeated &quot;collect&quot; toverify that it had spotted the key word in the sentence - and the system evenmanaged to handle a thick Japanese accent.andM;- o -andM;The Consultative Committee of International Telephony and  Telegraphy - CCITT- has finally announced the ratification of the V.42bis data compressionstandard - much to the joy of Newbury, Berkshire-based Dowty InformationSystems, the first UK modem manufacturer to get behind the standard:technical director at Dowty, Dr Alan Clark, admitted the the announcement hadtaken longer than expected, but that Dowty was now ready to incorporateV.42bis into its product range.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;E Corp, San Francisco says that as it has been focussing all its human andfinancial resources on the commercial introduction of the Receptor System, ithas been neglecting its voice mail product line to the point where it is bestto divest the business: it has therefore sold it to Cobotyx Corp, amanufacturer and distributor of voice processing products, on terms that werenot disclosed by ATandamp;E.andM;- o -andM;Alcatel NV and Qualcom Inc, San Diego are to form Alcatel-Qualcomm as a51%-49% joint venture in Cergy, France: part of Alcatel'sRadiocommunications, Space and Defence Group, the new company is intended tostrengthen the partners' penetration into two-way mobile satellitecommunications throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, primarilyby making and marketing Qualcomm's Omnitracs System, which enables truckdrivers and their despatchers to communicate with each other at low cost,however far apart they are.andM;- o -andM;After nearly three years in beta the PC Adaptor for Integrated ServicesDigital Network has finally been released by Hayes Microcomputer ProductsInc, Norcross, Georgia: Hayes also announced ISDNBIOS development tools, andan ISDN developers' lab in Atlanta: the adaptor will be available in thesummer at $1,600 and ISDNBIOS costs $125;
