(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jon PepperandM;The products listed below are desktop computers that use Intel Corp.'s 386SXas their microprocessor.andM;All of the models were either being shipped at press time or were productsfor which the company was taking orders and intended to ship by thepublication date.andM;----------FLEXCACHE SX386, Advanced Logic Research Inc.andP;  The FlexCache SX386microcomputer from Advanced Logic Research Inc. is the only product currentlyon the market that uses both the Intel 386SX CPU and the Intel 82385cache-memory controller.andM;The 82385 cache-memory controller, which is used in many 80386-basedproducts, increases overall system performance by eliminating wait statesthrough its cache-management scheme.andM;Advanced Logic Research's FlexCache SX386 uses a 16K-byte cache of35-nanosecond memory that the company claims is approximately 30 percentfaster than Compaq Computer Corp.'s Deskpro 386s.andM;A small-footprint desktop computer, the SX386 is 6 inches by 15 inches by 17inches and includes 1M byte of RAM, a 16MHz, zero-wait-state 80386SX CPU,five AT-compatible expansion slots, a 1.44M-byte, 3-1/2-inch floppy drive,and serial and parallel ports.andM;Maximum RAM expansion on the FlexCache SX386 is 16M bytes, of which 8M bytescan be high-speed memory directly added to the CPU card.andM;The backplane design of the SX386 is modular, so that the CPU card can beremoved for servicing or for upgrading to a 20MHz 80386 CPU.andM;Options from ALR include a Video Graphics Array (VGA) card, a monitor and amouse.andP;  Other features of the unit are integration of the input/output (I/O)controllers on the CPU board to save slots and a front-mounted, power-onswitch.andM;Up to four half-height, 5-1/4-inch or 3-1/2-inch mass-storage devices can beadded to the unit, including a 40M-byte hard drive supplied by ALR, whichfeatures 1-to-1 interleave with full-track buffering and a data-transfer ratefaster than 500 kilobytes per second.andM;Base price for the FlexCache Model 10, which does not include a hard drive,is $2,595.andP;  The enhanced Model 40, which includes the above-mentioned40M-byte hard disk, lists for $3,799.andM;The names of users were not available.andM;Advanced Logic Research is located at 9401 Jeronimo, Irvine, Calif.andP;  92718(714) 581-6770.andM;VIP SX386, Advanced Logic Research Inc.andP;  The VIP SX386 computer from ALR ispackaged in an extremely small chassis that measures only 4.5 inches by 7inches by 15 inches.andP;  It has a modular CPU board and a five-slot backplane.andM;Included on the system backplane are the hard-disk controller, thefloppy-disk controller and the serial port.andP;  The small-footprint unit doesnot include a printer port as a standard feature.andM;Base features of the system are a 1.44M-byte, 3-1/4-inch floppy drive and512K bytes of RAM.andM;Like the FlexCache SX386, the VIP also includes the Intel 82385 cache-memorycontroller with 16K bytes of cache RAM.andM;The VIP is designed to work as either a compact, stand-alone workstation oras a network node and is adapted to work with ALR's Ethernet or ARCNETadapter cards.andM;Maximum memory on the VIP SX386 is 8M bytes on the main system board.andO;Support for the Intel 80387SX math coprocessor is provided, and a 65-wattpower supply is standard equipment.andM;There are two models of the VIP SX386.andP;  The Model 10, which lists for $2,395,does not include a hard disk.andP;  The Model 40, which lists for $3,695, includesa 28-millisecond, 40M-byte hard-disk drive in the chassis, along with the3-1/2-inch floppy disk.andM;By swapping out CPU cards, the VIP SX386 can be upgraded to a 20MHz 80386 CPUwith a maximum of 10M bytes of RAM.andM;The names of users were not available.andM;Advanced Logic Research is located at 9401 Jeronimo, Irvine, Calif.andP;  92718(714) 581-6770.andM;DESKPRO 386s, Compaq Computer Corp.andP;  Introduced in June 1988, the Deskpro386s was the first personal computer on the market to utilize the Intel 386SXmicroprocessor technology.andM;Designed as a high-performance alternative to '286 computers, the 386s atthat time featured a number of key differences from other Compaq ComputerCorp models.andP;  Those features included the small footprint, an integratedgraphics controller and a mouse port.andM;There are three basic Deskpro 386s models: Model 1, Model 20 and Model 40.andO;The systems share the same basic features and are distinguished by theirmass-storage options.andM;Standard features on all models are the 16MHz 80386SX microprocessor, asocket for a 16MHz Intel 386SX math coprocessor, a single high-speedmemory-expansion slot, an integrated VGA-compatible graphics controller, andparallel and serial I/O ports.andM;Also included in the base equipment is an auxiliary input interface.andP;  ThisAUX input is suitable for a mouse or other pointing device, leaving theserial port free for an asynchronous-communications device.andM;Compaq includes its Compaq Expanded Memory Manager (CEMM) and disk-cachesoftware with each system, along with a security lock, front-mounted on/offswitch and a 140-watt power supply.andM;Every model includes a single 5-1/4-inch, 1.2M-byte diskette drive.andP;  Physicalcharacteristics include a small-footprint chassis that measures 5.9 inches by14.8 inches by 15.8 inches.andM;Inside the chassis is room for a total of up to four mass-storage devices.andO;Compaq offers a number of mass-storage options, including floppy- , tape- andhard-disk drives.andM;Twenty megabyte, 40M- and 110M-byte hard-disk drives are available; thelatter has an average access time of less than 25 milliseconds, while thefirst two feature average access times of less than 29 milliseconds.andM;Any two hard-disk drives may be installed in a Compaq Deskpro 386s system.andM;Besides the standard 1.2M-byte floppy drive, two other floppy drives areoptional.andP;  A 360K-byte 5-1/4-inch floppy drive and a 3-1/2-inch, 1.44M-bytefloppy drive are both available.andM;The system can be configured with any two of the floppy drives at the sametime.andM;Compaq also offers two tape-backup units, a 40M-byte and a 135M-byte system.andO;Both are designed to be mounted internally.andM;The tape-backup units are supported by the SY-TOS Tape Operating system,which is included with the 135M-byte fixed tape-backup unit.andM;Other software options included MS DOS 3.3 and OS/2, in either 3-1/2-inch or5-1/4-inch versions.andP;  Of the total of five expansion slots, four arefull-sized 8- or 16-bit expansion slots, and one is a high-speed memory slotfor 16-bit memory.andM;The Compaq Deskpro 386s includes a number of functions on the system board,leaving the expansion slots free.andP;  The graphics controller, hard-diskcontroller and I/O interfaces are all on the system board.andM;The Deskpro 386s uses what Compaq refers to as a concurrent-bus design.andP;  Thisbus architecture allows all system components to operate at their optimumspeed.andM;Combined in the system are a high-speed memory bus operating at 16MHz and an8MHz peripheral bus that helps ensure compatibility with various expansioncards.andM;List price for the Compaq Deskpro 386s Model 1, which includes only the1.2M-byte floppy drive and no hard-disk drive, is $3,299.andP;  List price for theModel 20, which includes the 20M-byte fixed-disk drive, is $3,799.andM;The Model 40, which includes a 40M-byte hard-disk drive, lists for $4,199.andO;No monitor is included in the basic system price of any model.andM;Compaq's Video Graphics Color Monitor lists for $699, and the 110M-bytehard-disk drive sells for $3,499.andM;Compaq Computer Corp. is located at 20555 FM 149, Houston, Texas 77070 (713)370-0670.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;For Brian Combs, manager of the information center at a major West Coastshipping company, the Compaq Deskpro 386s is the hardware platform forlong-term growth and cost-effectiveness.andM;''We are using them in our computer-aided software-engineering [CASE] area,and we like the small footprint quite a lot,'' said Combs.andM;Another feature Combs found to be a plus is ''the fact that the VGA is on themotherboard.'' He added that the Compaq ''is just pretty well set up and wellmade.andP;  We have about 70 of them and, except for one bad power supply, theyhave all been fine.''andM;Combs explained that he would rather spend the approximately $200 extra forthe 386SX instead of buying a '286 computer.andP;  ''That is our generalrecommendation to the business units,'' he said.andM;CPU 386/SX, Computer Products United.andP;  The CPU 386/SX features amade-in-America motherboard that is backed by an 18-month warranty.andM;Unlike many competitive models, the 386/SX can accommodate a 20MHz Harris80286 processor in place of the standard 16MHz Intel 80386SX CPU.andP;  Either CPUcan reside on a small plug-in board that is an extension of the motherboardvia a euro connector.andM;This provides flexibility in configuration for customers who might prefer tobegin with the high-speed '286 model and then upgrade to the 386SX CPU whenmore 32-bit software is available.andM;A basic CPU 386SX system includes 512K bytes of memory, a 1.2M-bytefloppy-disk drive, a combined floppy- and hard-disk controller, a 200-wattpower supply, a 101-key enhanced keyboard, two serial ports, one parallelport and a game port.andM;List price for the basic system is $1,295.andM;The 512K bytes of system RAM with the basic system is composed of two banksof 256K-byte single in-line memory modules (SIMMs).andM;However, it can be upgraded on the motherboard to a total of 8M bytes byusing eight 1M-byte SIMMs, with four-way page-interleave mode.andM;Also supported is up to 384K bytes of shadow RAM for fast basic input/outputsystem (BIOS) and video-output access.andP;  A Lotus/Intel/MicrosoftExpanded-Memory System (LIM EMS) 4.0 expanded-memory drive is included in thebasic system as well.andM;The floppy/hard-disk controller supports up to two floppy and two harddrives, with a 1:1 interleave factor.andM;System architecture is based on Chips andamp; Technologies Inc.'s NEAT chip set.andP;  Atotal of eight expansion slots is offered, with six 16-bit slots and two8-bit slots.andM;Support is available for either the Intel 287 math coprocessor or the 16MHzIntel 387SX math coprocessor via a jumper select.andM;The system, which uses the Award BIOS, comes with a 30-day, money-backguarantee, exclusive of shipping charges.andM;A comprehensive one-year parts-and-labor warranty is included for basesystems, while add-on products such as hard drives are offered with the OEMwarranty.andM;The CPU/386SX can be configured with a wide range of disk and monitoroptions.andM;The price for a 1M-byte RAM upgrade is $200.andP;  A 4M-byte RAM upgrade is $1,000above the base price, and 8M bytes of RAM cost $2,200.andM;Computer Products United is located at 12803 Schabarum Ave., Irwindale,Calif.andP;  91706 (818) 338-5959.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;For Bea Dickey, a section manager for purchasing with Raytheon Co., inOxnard, Calif., the most important consideration leading to the purchase ofthe Computer Products United 386SX was overall quality and serviceability.andM;''It doesn't do any good to pay a cheap price for a machine that doesn'twork, or that you can't get parts for and can't get fixed,'' said Dickey.andM;She said she has been quite pleased with the 386SX.andP;  ''There are no aspectswe are unhappy with, and we have had no problems at all with them.''andM;Dickey did say, however, that price was a factor in selecting this machine.andO;''I wouldn't say it was the No.andP;  1 factor, but it was definitely an issue.''andM;EVEREX STEP 386, Everex Systems Inc., Computer Systems Division.andP;  The EverexSTEP 386is is being offered as Everex' entry-level solution for 32-bitcomputing.andM;Based on the Intel 386SX chip, the product features full support for theIntel 386SX math coprocessor.andP;  Unlike most competitive systems, the STEP386is is available in two different chassis styles: either a small-footprintunit that has three half-height drive bays, or a standard footprint modelwith five half-height drive bays.andM;The manufacturer claims that the performance, at 3.2 million instructions persecond (mips), is superior to that of comparable models from Compaq or NECCorp.andM;Basic features for the STEP 386is include the 16MHz 386SX CPU;zero-wait-state operation;
