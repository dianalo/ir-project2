The Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, which represents about 2,000 employees, recently took the ban to arbitration. The union said the company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, has declined to hold up the ban pending resolution of the grievance.    A hearing on the court request has been set for June 10. A Dow Jones spokesman said the smoking ban will take effect Wednesday, as scheduled.    The union asserts that the ban violates terms of its existing contract with Dow Jones.    A Dow Jones spokesman said the policy bans smoking in all company locations except in designated smoking areas. He said the company believes the policy &quot;is in the best interests of all of its employees&quot; and is consistent with its collective bargaining agreement. &quot;Dow Jones is confident that the union's challenge will fail.&quot;    Dow Jones also publishes Barron's magazine and other periodicals, electronic business information services and community newspapers. It also owns 56% of Telerate Inc., which provides computerized financial information on global markets. </TEXT></DOC>
