In his speech, Gorbachev hinted that he would favor another summitsoon.;   Gorbachev's pledge to eliminate tactical nuclear arms affects a classof weapons that has caused the most worry recently for western experts as theSoviet Union threatens to disintegrate. The Kremlin's arsenal of tacticalnuclear weapons, probably numbering more than 15,000 and located in severalrepublics, is the most susceptible to theft by terrorists, to appropriation bybreakaway republics and to unauthorized launching, experts have said.;  Matching President Bush's plan for radical cutbacks in the tactical nucleararsenal, Gorbachev said he would eliminate all nuclear land mines andartillery shells and remove all tactical nuclear weapons from surface ships,submarines and naval aircraft. He also pledged to destroy or place in storagethe nuclear rockets of the nation's anti-aircraft troops.;   One step further;  In addition, Gorbachev proposed that the United States agree to remove fromthe front line all aviation-based nuclear tactical weapons, meaning bombs androckets, a category not included in Bush's unilateral initiative. And hechallenged Bush to go one step further, &quot;on a mutual basis,&quot; and destroy allsea-based tactical nuclear weapons, instead of just withdrawing and storingthem, as Bush pledged.;   Gorbachev also outlined a series of substantive butless sweeping measures to limit the strategic nuclear arsenal, phasing outdevelopment of some weapons and promising not to modernize others. Where Bushasked for negotiations to ban all land-based, multiple-warhead strategicmissiles, Gorbachev promised only that the number of such missiles that aremobile -- meaning they can be moved on trucks or railroads -- will notincrease.;   No nuclear tests;   Gorbachev renewed the Soviet commitment notto conduct nuclear tests for at least another year and called for Washingtonto follow suit. Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union would destroy 1,000 moreweapons than called for under the latest arms-control treaty, START, duringthe seven years of the treaty. This would leave the arsenal with 5,000 suchweapons instead of 6,000, and still allow for further negotiated reductions.He called for speedy ratification of the START treaty, saying it will beconsidered at the first session of the new Soviet parliament, scheduled tomeet Oct. 21.;   The Soviet president also called for further talks ondefenses against missile attack and on the possibility of developing a jointsystem of early warning against nuclear attack.;   Bush pledged unilateralarms cuts in a televised address last week. He said changes in the directionof democracy and reform in the Soviet Union allowed a &quot;swifter, bolder&quot;approach to disarmament than traditional arms control negotiations.;   Cutsunbalanced; From the beginning, Soviet officials had warned that it would beeasier to match U.S. cuts in tactical weapons than in strategic ones. Bush'sproposal, which would leave intact the U.S. arsenal of submarine-basedlong-range missiles, was seen widely in the Soviet Union as unbalanced, sinceland-based missiles form the heart of the Soviet strategic force.;   In thearea of strategic weapons, Gorbachev promised Saturday night to haltdevelopment of a small mobile intercontinental ballistic missile and of a newgeneration of short-range nuclear missiles to be carried on strategic bombers.He said the number of launching sites of rail-based ICBMs will not beincreased and such missiles will not be modernized, and he pledged to keep allrail-based ICBMs in their permanent bases.;   The Soviet president also saidstrategic bombers will not be on military standby, and their nuclear weaponswill be stored, matching one of Bush's promises. But Gen. Merrill McPeak, U.S.Air Force chief of staff, told reporters here Friday that Soviet bombers hadnever been kept on full alert as in the United States.;   Like Bush, Gorbachevsaid all Soviet nuclear forces henceforth would come under a single command,which Gorbachev said would increase &quot;the reliability of control over nuclearweapons.&quot; He also announced that Soviet troops would be cut by 700,000.;GORBACHEV'S PROPOSALS; TACTICAL WEAPONS: Eliminate nuclear artillery andnuclear warheads from tactical, or short-range, rockets; remove all tacticalnuclear weapons from ships and submarines.; STRATEGIC WEAPONS: Reduce numberof long-range nuclear warheads below that mandated by arms reduction treatysigned this summer; 503 ICBMs will be taken off alert status.; BILATERALSUGGESTIONS: Soviet Union and U.S. scrap tactical nuclear weapons of the Navy;negotiate further radical reductions in offensive strategic weapons -- cuttingtheir number by about half.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911006  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,121  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 6, 199100280034,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
