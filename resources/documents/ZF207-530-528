THETELEPHONE AS NETWORK.andP;  The &quot;network&quot;  has existed since the dawn of trade,when the technology involved was language, i.e., word of mouth.andP;  IndustrialAge high technology of the late nineteenth century led to a newcommunications tool called the telephone.andP;  It was a natural extension ofspeech and quickly became as basic to the office environment as pen andpaper.andP;  By the advent of data processing in the 1950s, telephones were afamiliar part of everyday life.andP;  They were seen as low tech, a heritage thatpersists today.andM;The perception of telephony as low tech and computers as high tech resultedin long-term consequences.andP;  Telecommunications and Information Systemsmanagement are traditionally separate, by function and by organization.andO;Computers, because of the complexity, environmental requirements, and highcost of ownership, required separate organizations reporting to a seniormanager with a dedicated function.andP;  Telephones, on the other hand, wereconsidered a cost of doing business, akin to desks and paper clips, and werethe responsibility of the office manager.andP;  As voice communications grew inthe  60s and  70s, it was a cost to be controlled.andP;  At about the same time, asmall number of visionaries realized the strategic impact computers couldhave on core business  functions.andP;  TELEPHONES VERSUS COMPUTERS.andP;  Growth andmaturity entrenched the cultural differences in both industry segments.andO;Telephones constituted a closed system as an outgrowth of monopoly.andP;  The soleprovider had to be all things to all people and at a reasonable cost.andP;  Therewas no customization, and you could only have it one way.andP;  Computers wereclosed systems as a function of proprietary architectures intended to &quot;lockin&quot; customers.andP;  Data processing specialists were needed to build turnkeysystems dedicated to specific business functions.andP;  You had it your way, andpaid the price.andP;  Entrepreneurial versus Monopolistic.andP;  The computer industrygrew entrepreneurially.andP;  Technology drove the technology.andP;  Entrepreneurs sawthe possibilities, and profit potential, new generations of computers wouldprovide.andP;  Companies like Digital, Wang, and Data General became establishedplayers, to be followed by the likes of Apple and Compaq.andP;  During the sameperiod, the telephone industry clung to its monopolistic ways, slowing theforces of change, not driving them.andP;  But the public network was, and is, areal-time distributed system that is never down for system updates, upgrades,or periodic maintenance.andP;  When major outages occur, it is news of the &quot;ManBites Dog&quot; variety.andP;  This is the degree of reliability we are just beginningto expect in general purpose computing environments.andP;  Value versus Commodity.andO;These disparate approaches to the competitive world have left their legacieswith the buying public.andP;  Computer systems are purchased on a value basis,whereas telephones are a commodity; computer users pay for support, but thetelephone user expects support gratis; the warranty on a PC ninety days, on atelephone, one year; computer systems are measured against definedbenchmarks, without performance guarantees in a production environment, whiletelephone systems are engineered for a given, and guaranteed, performancelevel.andP;  Differing expectations affect buying behavior and, ultimately, theability to integrate networked systems.andP;  THE NEED FOR VISION.andP;  Integratedsystems management organizations may begin with a chief information officer,but that is only a first step.andP;  It is a top-down approach geared tofunctional staff structures in industrial enterprises.andP;  Information Ageenterprises, however, will be different, logically and culturally.andO;Information systems management must also be different.andP;  The PC revolution setthe stage for business managers to play an integral role in driving the look,feel, and capabilities of business applications.andP;  The vision of thoseinnovative users is a resource that must be tapped if  corporate informationnetworks are to become reality.andM;For those vendors and users pursuing the integration of voice and data, onefactor has remained constant-it is difficult, at best, to sell an integratedsolution to a nonintegrated world.andP;  But with vision and commitment, thenetwork of the  90s will take shape to serve the needs of people-to-peoplecommunications in the Global Village.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
