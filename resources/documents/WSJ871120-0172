But there aren't yet any indications that this trend will affect Japanese investment in real estate overseas.    Data released by private research organizations this week suggest real-estate prices are either stabilizing or dropping in some parts of Tokyo after an extraordinary boom. This could be a sign that the government is successfully suppressing the mania that has made it impossible for many Japanese to buy land, or that the mania has simply run its course.    Indeed, many analysts attribute the price shift to remedial measures taken by the government to subdue speculation. The Bank of Japan has directed commercial banks to restrain lending for speculative real-estate transactions.    The Diet, or parliament, raised the tax on capital gains from property bought and sold within two years to 96% starting Oct. 1. The new rules -- under which the tax decreases to 85% on property sold within two to five years and 61% on that sold after five years -- encourage investors to hold on to their real estate. Previously, the tax was 85% for property turned over within 10 years, decreasing to 61% after 10 years. Local governments also have stepped up surveillance of land transactions, in theory discouraging frenzied buying and selling with red tape.    The recent panic in global stock markets also may have slowed the flow of cash into Tokyo real estate as Japanese companies have become more circumspect in their investments, some analysts say.    Whatever is behind the reversal, it doesn't appear to signal a change in Japanese investment overseas. A recent move by Shuwa Corp., the real-estate giant, to call off two major U.S. transactions is seen as an isolated case. Analysts say Shuwa has been much more aggressive in the U.S. market than other Japanese companies, and some speculate Shuwa may have been temporarily overextended on credit.    Indeed, New York and other foreign properties are expected to remain cheap compared with real estate here. The Bank of Japan's warning to financial institutions isn't thought to apply to nonspeculative overseas investment.    Although prices are still rising in Tokyo suburbs and other major cities, some observers believe a sharp downturn in Japan's real-estate market is starting.    &quot;It's going to be a chain reaction,&quot; says Katsushi Tsunoda, an analyst at the Real Estate Economics Research Center in Tokyo. &quot;Once land prices stop rising, the selling is going to begin, and selling breeds more selling.&quot;    Mr. Tsunoda predicts an average drop of 30% to 40% in land prices nationwide over the long term. But he and other real-estate experts doubt that a fall of that magnitude would seriously affect the solvency of Japanese banks, which have lent aggressively on inflated real-estate collateral. Many of those banks financed mortgages before prices peaked last summer, and larger institutions would be better able to absorb any losses from re-mortgaging. The smaller financial institutions that lent aggressively are at the highest risk.    The value of land rose so markedly -- doubling and tripling in the past few years in some urban areas -- that it is difficult to imagine a return to levels before the boom. There is a strong belief that land will always retain value because it is in short supply.    Though real-estate industry sources have talked about declining prices in some speculative properties for several months, data now support a broader trend.    Recruit Corp., a Tokyo research and public-relations company that has a major real-estate subsidiary, conducts a monthly survey of changes in asking prices for land, houses and condominiums. Prices were lowered, instead of raised, in 90% of cases surveyed in Tokyo at the end of September, Recruit says. That figure stood at 71.3% at the end of last May.    While land prices in Tokyo suburbs rose more than 60% in the year ending Sept. 30, commercial land prices in central Tokyo rose a mere 0.8%, the Japan Real Estate Research Institute says.    &quot;It's now a pretty well-documented turnaround,&quot; says Simon Smithson, a real-estate analyst at Kleinwort Benson International Inc. &quot;It's too early to say whether we're seeing any major breakdown in the long-term supply situation, but there's potential for radical price movement on the downside.&quot;    Declining land prices appear to be most evident in property that has little practical use. &quot;A lot of the speculative land purchases have centered on land where you can't build,&quot; says Toru Suzuki of Mitsui Real Estate's planning department.    Some foreign observers fear that a tumbling Japanese real-estate market might touch off another round of global financial panic. Their worry -- viewed as far-fetched here -- is that confidence in the Japanese financial system could be undermined if enough borrowers default on loans backed by valueless real-estate collateral.    &quot;I think there's a possibility for serious enough falls to give people pause,&quot; says Kleinwort Benson's Mr. Smithson. &quot;But I don't subscribe to the implosion theory that says a Tokyo land crash will destroy the global economy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
