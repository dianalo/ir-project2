Somerstein, a NewYork-based attorney for Joe Doherty. ``The delay already has beeninterminable, and he's been incarcerated all through this. Thelength of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of fairness, ofreasonableness.''   Doherty has been in federal prison in Manhattan since FBI agentsarrested him June 28, 1983, at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan, where heworked as a part-time bartender after breaking out of a maximumsecurity prison in Northern Ireland more than six years ago.   Thornburgh got involved in the case Thursday at the request ofthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, which wants to deportDoherty, said Dave Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general.   At issue is a Board of Immigration Appeals decision last Nov. 14that Doherty could reopen his request for political asylum in theUnited States and remanding that request to an INS judge.   If Thornburgh had not gotten involved, Doherty could have pursuedhis case with the judge, Justice Department spokesman Loye Millersaid.   Since the attorney general can modify or overrule decisions ofthe board, Thornburgh could decide to deny Doherty asylum without anINS judge hearing the case.   ``We had requested that the attorney general not review it andjust allow us our day in court to press our political asylum claimthat the board said we should have,'' Somerstein said in a telephoneinterview.   ``It's tantamount to his being a judge in his own case,'' he said.   Doherty was convicted with three others of the killing thatoccurred during a gunfight between British soldiers and IRA memberswho had planned to ambush a British Army patrol in 1980.   He contends he is neither a terrorist nor a murderer, but asoldier engaged in war, and he is seeking asylum on the grounds thathe would be subject to persecution if sent to Britain.   On Thursday, Thornburgh ordered that INS submit by March 27 abrief in support of its position. After that, Doherty will have 30days to submit a brief arguing his case, and then the INS will have14 days to file a reply.   The British have been seeking Doherty's return to Britain since1983, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the issue withthen-President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.   U.S. District Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn denied Britain'sextradition request in December 1984, saying Doherty's crime was apolitical act and qualified him for political asylum.   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haightruled in Doherty's favor. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Yorkupheld Doherty's previous victories.   Then the Justice Department began deportation proceedings.   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland. Immigration JudgeHoward I. Cohen upheld that decision in 1986.   Since then, the government has appealed three times and lost eachtime, the most recent loss coming last Nov. 14.   Doherty asked the Board of Immigration Appeals to revoke hisconcession that he was deportable after Ireland in December 1987ratified the European Convention on Terrorism. The convention callsfor mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists and would havemeant that Doherty would have been extradited from Ireland toBritain.</TEXT></DOC>
