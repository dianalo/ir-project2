Robert E. Mercer, chairman and chief executive officer, wouldn't make a forecast for the fourth quarter that began Saturday, but he predicted it would top the third quarter. &quot;This is a trough, and we'll go back up,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't see any long-term problems.&quot;    Mr. Mercer cited sharply higher raw material costs for the company's woes, which led it to announce on Tuesday that third-quarter earnings from continuing operations may have declined about 50% from the year-earlier period.    Goodyear made the forecast after the market closed Tuesday. With yesterday's decline, Goodyear shares closed at $53.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The announcement surprised industry analysts, who were expecting the world's largest tire maker to report a modest decline in third-quarter earnings.    &quot;It's a bombshell, coming out of nowhere,&quot; said Donald F. DeScenza, an analyst at Nomura Securites Inc. But Mr. DeScenza said that although he lowered his 1988 earnings estimate for the company, he hasn't changed his forecast for the fourth quarter or for 1989.    The Akron, Ohio, company said third-quarter earnings from continuing operations could be as low as $1.10 a share compared with $170.4 million, or $2.98 a share, which included 88 cents a share from unusual items. In the 1987 third quarter, the company also had profit from discontinued operations of $8.3 million, which made net $178.7 million, or $3.13 a share.    Sales in the 1987 third quarter were $2.48 billion.    Mr. Mercer said announced price increases this year lagged behind escalating raw-materials costs, hurting the tire industry as a whole and Goodyear in particular. &quot;We've had it to a greater extent because of our larger volume and greater involvement in the original-equipment area.&quot;    The executive added that &quot;the depth of the margin squeeze was greater than I expected.&quot;    He noted that rubber prices jumped about 40% and that some petrochemicals used in tire making rose as much as 40% to 130%. Raw-materials prices have begun to level off, Mr. Mercer said.    Adding to Goodyear's problems were extremely high temperatures that affected tire production at some plants. Mr. Mercer wouldn't disclose the extent of the production decline.    Some of Goodyear's competitors also have been hurt by rising raw-materials costs, including Groupe Michelin, of France, and General Tire andamp; Rubber Co., a unit of Continental AG, of West Germany.    A spokesman at General Tire, Akron, said the problem was exacerbated because the intense battle among the global producers to increase market share kept prices down. He said General Tire had difficulty getting price increases to hold despite tight supplies in some lines.    &quot;It's a wild situation, and it goes against the laws of supply and demand,&quot; said the General Tire spokesman. &quot;We have to be the only industry that is running at full capacity and having a pricing problem.&quot;    Some analysts, however, say that price increases are beginning to stick. In fact, Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber Co., a maker of replacement tires based in Findley, Ohio, expects to achieve record earnings this year, a spokesman said. Besides Goodyear, Cooper is the only other publicly traded U.S. tire maker. </TEXT></DOC>
