(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of Massachusetts hasrescinded an order banning five conservative clubs at the schoolfrom renting meeting rooms and vending tables at the Campus Center,a spokeswoman said Monday.   However, the campus Republican Club and an affiliate of aCambridge-based Marxist group, the Spartacist League, remain underthe ban because of a brawl between members of those groups at theschool Feb. 9, said spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.   A student was injured in the fight, which was the secondconfrontation between the groups in a month. The head of the schoolbuildings departemnt is investigating the incident.   Hopkins said the ban had been widened to other conservativestudent groups because they were suspected of renting rooms for theRepublican Club in defiance of the ban.   The school lifted the ban against the other groups on Friday.Hopkins said the Office of Student Affairs felt the ban ``wasn't themost appropriate way to handle the situation.''   An attorney for the Republican Club said he believed the ban wasa violation of the club's right of free speech and assembly and thathe was speaking with university attorneys about lifting it.   ``I believe if we went into court, it would say that theuniversity deprived the group of its rights,'' said Attorney LesBlack.</TEXT></DOC>
