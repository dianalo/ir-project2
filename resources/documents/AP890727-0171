The Bountiful, from New Beford, was allegedly seven nauticalmiles into Canadian water, about 165 miles east of Nantucket, whenit was spotted Wednesday by the patrol boat.   By escaping to American water, it probably dodged severeCanadian penalties but may still face action under U.S. law.   The skipper of the Bountiful, David Saunders, denied he wasfishing in Canadian territory and said the patrol boat rammed himafter threatening to fire.   ``They deliberately ran me down,'' he said.   ``They told me to get everybody off the deck because they weregoing to open fire,'' said Saunders. ``I said we're an unarmedvessel. There's 10 unarmed guys here, you can't shoot me.''   Asked why he refused to stop for the Canadians, Saunders said``Would you stop if someone was stopping you with a .50-caliber?I'm not stopping.''   It was the sixth incident in a year-long boundary disputebetween American fishermen and Canadian patrols.   ``It's really inconceivable that two countries as close as ours,politically, geographically ... can't resolve matters as relativelyuncomplicated as this,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., a seniormember of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.   The chase lasted 140 miles and about 18 hours.   The Canadian patrol boat Cygnus chased the Bountiful into the200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone where it was rammed by thefishing boat, said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason. Noinjuries or serious damage were reported.   The Canadian government denied the Cygnus crew permission tofire warning shots across the Bountiful's bow after it was rammed.   The Bountiful was boarded by the Coast Guard when it dockedThursday, and National Marine Fisheries officials took stock of thecatch.   Ken Crossman, special NMFS agent for the Northeast, said hisinvestigators would share information with Canadian officials, whocould prepare an arrest warrant only executable in Canada.   If the Canadians provide sufficient documentation to prove theBountiful was illegally fishing, ``then separately, through U.S.prosecution channels, the boat is subject to prosecution'' underU.S. law, Crossman said.   Under federal law, the boat's captain could face a maximumpenalty of a $10,000 fine and a year in jail for transporting anillegal catch.   ``That may shed a little light for you on why it's so importantto these fishermen to not be caught by the Canadians where theyface several hundred thousand dollars (in fines) under Canadianlaw, as well as physical arrest and detention of the boat,''Crossman said.   Incidents along the so-called Hague fisheries line _ the lineset by the International Court of Justice in the Hague,Netherlands, in 1984 to separate U.S. and Canadian marine zones _are on the rise because fishing stocks on the U.S. side are beingdepleted and the Canadians are aggressively patrolling their area.   A New Bedford boat was recently pursued by the Canadians for 14hours. Last year, Canadian patrols fired on another New Bedfordscalloper, the Donna Lynn, after its captain refused to letofficials board, claiming the boat was in U.S. water.   Canadian officials maintain the American fisherman areintentionally crossing the boundary. But Studds has said that thecrossings are simply mistakes.   According to a Studds aide, Jeff Pike, five of the sixnavigational charts issued to American fisherman by the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration contain U.S.-Canadian bordererrors of up to four miles.</TEXT></DOC>
