Intended to save $35 billion over the next eight years,Mr. Cheney's long-awaited recommendations would involvecutting to 120 planes from 210 the Air Force's planned fleetof C-17 troop transports. In addition, the defense secretaryproposed stretching out development and reducing productionrates for the next generation of high-performance Navy andAir Force jet fighters.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cheney told lawmakers that a major factor in hisproposal to scale back fighter production plans was his&quot;preliminary&quot; decision to reduce the number of Navy aircraftcarriers to 12 from the current 14 over the next few years.He also said, &quot;There's no question we're going to have asmaller Air Force&quot; by that time, although he didn't provideany specifics.   But the proposals clearly won't satisfy increasinglypowerful congressional critics, who are demanding deeper cutsin Pentagon spending and outright termination of one of thehigh-technology airplanes. By &quot;cutting a little bit andstretching a lot, you drive up the {unit} cost on virtuallyall of the programs,&quot; complained Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio),a leader of a bipartisan coalition to kill the radar-eludingB-2 bomber.   Testifying in back-to-back hearings of the House andSenate Armed Services Committees yesterday, Mr. Cheneyacknowledged that his plan would trim only about $2.4 billionfrom the Pentagon's request for $306.9 billion in spendingauthority for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But theproposal represents the opening volley in what promises to bean emotional and drawn-out battle between lawmakers and theBush administration over the shape of military aviation intothe 21st century.   While the cuts proposed by Mr. Cheney were severe, theyweren't as deep as many defense contractors had feared.Northrop Corp., which builds the B-2, greeted Mr. Cheney'srecommendations with sighs of relief. B-2 spending stillwould reach about $6 billion a year when production gets intofull swing. And compared with some proposals inside andoutside the Pentagon to gut the program by buying only 15 or30 of the bat-winged planes, &quot;75 aircraft is nothing tosneeze at,&quot; said Les Daly, a senior Northrop vice president.   Industry officials also were pleased that the programinvolving the largest number of contractors, the Air Force's$60 billion-plus Advanced Tactical Fighter program, would bedelayed by two years but otherwise would come throughunscathed. &quot;Talk about joy in heaven,&quot; said James Blackwell,vice president and general manager of the ATF office atLockheed Corp, which is teamed on the program with Boeing Co.and General Dynamics Corp. The other team bidding for thefighter contract includes Northrop and McDonnell DouglasCorp.   Still, Mr. Blackwell acknowledged that &quot;there will be alot of presidents and a lot of Congresses to get through&quot;before ATF production reaches robust rates.   Mr. Cheney seems to be driven more by domestic politicaland fiscal pressures to reduce U.S. defense spending than byany fundamental reassessment of Soviet military capabilities.He testified that the U.S. intelligence community stillexpects Kremlin leaders to deploy potent new supersonicfighters and sophisticated air defense systems over the nextdecade or so, although the improvements are bound to beslower than expected as a result of serious economic problemsin the Soviet Union.   House Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin (D.,Wis.) said Mr. Cheney's proposals were &quot;still based on anunrealistically pessimistic view of the Soviet threat&quot; and anoptimistic reading of how much Congress is willing to spendon defense. &quot;I think he's in trouble on both counts,&quot; Rep.Aspin told reporters.   In his testimony, Mr. Cheney strongly suggested that hemay have to propose deeper cuts later this year, when thePentagon submits its revised long-term spending blueprint toCongress. If lawmakers reject the administration's militaryspending plans, he said, &quot;I'm going to come back with eventougher calls.&quot;   Up to a few hours before the proposal was released, Mr.Cheney personally supervised last-minute revisions. Theconclusions were so tightly held that congressional leadersdidn't receive any advance briefings, and even the civilianchiefs of each of the services didn't review the finaldocument until yesterday morning.   Here are highlights of Mr. Cheney's proposed cutbacks:                                                                                                          B-2 STEALTH BOMBER: By proposing to slash B-2 productionmore than 40% in order to make the beleaguered project morepalatable to lawmakers, Mr. Cheney risks pushing the totalcost of each plane above $800 million, compared with currentestimates of $530 million. The Pentagon now wants Northrop tobuild only 12 planes a year at the height of the program,instead of producing the 24 it envisioned previously.   As recently as last week, some top Pentagon officials weretalking about building 100 B-2s, using that higher figure asa bargaining chip. Mr Cheney said he is convinced that a75-plane fleet is &quot;about as low as you can go . . . and stillhave a significant amount of capability&quot; against Soviet airdefenses.   The fate of the B-2 program is all-important to LosAngeles-based Northrop, which derives about half its revenue,or some $2.5 billion a year, from the plane. Northrop's Mr.Daly said that Mr. Cheney's plan, besides reducing Northrop'sown anticipated revenues, could have a ripple effect on thenumber of employees at thousands of subcontractors working onthe Stealth program. But he maintained that Northrop stillwould be able to rid itself of its $880 million in debt bythe mid-1990s, as it has been planning.   Mr. Daly insisted that Northrop's profit margins on theprogram wouldn't be affected by Mr. Cheney's proposalsbecause under the terms of its contract, the government meetsall fixed costs, no matter what the production rate. Inrecent interviews, top corporate finance officials also havestressed that the Pentagon reimburses Northrop for most ofits variable costs, as well as the added interest expense itmust endure because of a stretch-out in production.   Still, many on Capitol Hill believe that even 75 planeswill prove to be an elusive dream. They said Mr. Cheneyhimself didn't appear firmly wedded to building that manyB-2s. &quot;It's the whole tone,&quot; said one top Senate Republicanaide. &quot;Cheney really didn't come over and say, `We have tohave that.'&quot;                                                                                                          C-17 TRANSPORT: McDonnell Douglas's C-17s originally wereintended to substantially increase the capacity of the U.S.to move large numbers of troops to Europe in case of a landwar with the Soviets. Mr. Cheney's proposal to cut theproposed fleet back by nearly 50% would result in a maximumproduction rate of 24 planes a year, compared with the 29envisioned earlier, and would set a much less ambitiousmission for the new aircraft: simply replacing aging C-141cargo carriers.   McDonnell Douglas, with its wide-ranging operations, isn'tas dependent on the C-17 as Northrop is on the Stealth. Andeven if the project is cut further on Capitol Hill, thecompany could take the 1.65 million square feet of factoryspace it has added to its Long Beach, Calif., facilities forproduction of the giant transport and use it to manufacturecommercial jetliners.   Nonetheless, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas hasinvested more than $500 million in the C-17, is eking outabout $8 million in profit per quarter on the program and iscounting on the cargo plane to help it maintain a healthybalance between Pentagon contracts and non-defense work. BobClepper, the company's C-17 program manager, said in a recentinterview that if McDonnell Douglas can't build at least 20aircraft a year, it will be difficult to maintain efficiencyand keep costs down. &quot;All of our facilities have been scopedout with the intention of producing 29 a year,&quot; Mr. Cleppersaid.                                                                                                          ADVANCED FIGHTERS: Calling the Navy's A-12 attack planeone of the military's &quot;most urgent requirements,&quot; Mr. Cheneymade it clear he is determined to push ahead with theprogram, although at a somewhat reduced rate.   At one point in his testimony, Mr. Cheney disclosedpreviously classified details about the A-12, including thatthe program has a price tag of about $52 billion.   General Dynamics, which along with McDonnell Douglasbuilds the plane, said in a statement that it was &quot;pleasedthat the A-12 requirement has been reaffirmed along with thefunding and planning for the early years of the program.&quot; Thefirst A-12 is supposed to be rolled out of an Air Force plantin Oklahoma this fall.   However, production of the Air Force's version of thefighter, called the Advanced Tactical Aircraft, would bescratched completely from the Defense Department's 1992-1997spending blueprint.   By contrast, Mr. Cheney's decision to preserve the AirForce's Advanced Tactical Fighter is welcome news to the twoteams of contractors, which together have invested more than$1.2 billion to design the two-engine, supersonic fighter.Mr. Cheney's plans would retain a naval version of the ATF,but delay deployment of that aircraft until 1998. In anironic twist, the defense chief acknowledged that the delaycould force the Pentagon to keep buying Grumman Corp.'s F-14fighter, a plane he lobbied hard to kill last year.</TEXT></DOC>
