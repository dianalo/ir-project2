The statement appeared to cast doubt on reports that talks wouldbegin Saturday in Rome between the government and the rebel TigrePeople's Liberation Army.   The rebel army has scored a string of victories since August,pushing government forces out of the rebels' home province of Tigreand making significant gains in neighboring Wollo and Gondarprovinces.   President Haile Mariam Mengistu did not mention the Rome talksin his address to an emergency session of the Shengo, the nationalparliament. He said the rebels ``must withdraw quickly from Wolloand Gondar'' before any negotiations begin.   The Shengo called the emergency meeting to hear a report on thegrowing rebel threat.   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting the Marxist government 15years. Another northern rebel group in Eritrea province has beenfighting a war of secession for 27 years.   The Central Committee of the ruling Marxist party convened anemergency meeting Monday to discuss the rebel problem. It was thefirst in the committee's five-year existence.   Mengistu told legislators one of the ``foremost tasks'' is tostrengthen the armed forces through recruitment and training.   Ethiopia has the largest standing army in sub-Saharan Africawith an estimated 315,000 regular troops and a people's militiathat includes everyone 18-50 years old.   The president also said that to meet ``the dangerous challengein northern Ethiopia'' all development projects approved for the1989-90 fiscal year will have to be suspended and the nationalbudget put on a war footing.   The Tigre rebels said late last week they had agreed to openpreliminary peace talks with the government in Rome on Saturday,with Italian officials acting as observers. The government has notcommented on that report.   The talks would come two weeks before another round of talks setto begin Nov. 18 between the government and the Eritrean People'sLiberation Front.   The Tigre rebels claimed Tuesday the government staged a30-minute air raid on the Tigrean provincial capital of Mekele,damaging 20 houses but causing no casualties.   On Monday, the rebels said 31 people were killed or injured and30 homes destroyed in a government air raid on the same city.</TEXT></DOC>
