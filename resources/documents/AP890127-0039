The congressionally mandated ban, which was to have gone intoeffect at 12:01 a.m., would have ended the midnight-to-6 a.m. ``safeharbor'' that the Federal Communications Commission had establishedfor sexually explicit TV programs.   But a coalition of broadcasters and civil rights groupschallenged the ban on constitutional grounds, and the court agreedto a temporary stay while it considered the case.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who wrote the indecency amendment intoa $14.9 billion appropriations bill last year, said Thursday he felthe would win the issue in the Supreme Court.   ``With the makeup of the court as it is now, I can't imaginethey'll duck the opportunity to protect children and society ingeneral from this sort of garbage,'' Helms said in a telephoneinterview. ``I believe the founding fathers never believed that theFirst Amendment could be so distorted to authorize, to permit thissort of garbage.''   During congressional debate, Helms had claimed the FCC waspermitting broadcasters to air programs that included ``disgustingbestiality, sodomy and child sex.''   The 24-hour ban was stayed on Monday by the federal appeals courtin Washington. The National Association of Broadcasters, which wasamong 17 challengers to the ban, said the court's ruling ``was ahopeful sign.''   ``What's not at issue here is the kind of pornographic matterthat much of the general public is concerned about,'' SteveBookshester, associate general counsel for the NAB, said Thursday.   ``Indecency is a pretty loaded word. How can you be in favor ofindecency? But the FCC definition of that term is pretty broad,'' hesaid.   ``You don't have a bunch of people who are making dirty movies.... That's not what this case is about,'' Bookshester said.   Indecent material, according to the FCC, is that which ``incontext, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive asmeasured by contemporary community standards for the broadcastmedium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''   The Washington appeals court last July upheld that definition,but said the FCC had not justified the midnight-to-6 a.m. safeharbor. Broadcasters had been seeking a 10 p.m. start of the safeharbor.   Obscene broadcasts, on the other hand, do not enjoyconstitutional protection. Such broadcasts are defined as those thatappeal to prurient interests and lack serious artistic, literary,political or scientific value.   FCC spokeswoman Maureen Peratino said the court action had thrownthe issue of indecent programming into limbo. The court issued onlya stay of the rules as it considered the challenge.   ``It keeps us where we are,'' she said. That means the FCC willcontinue to take action against ``indecent'' programming broadcastduring daylight hours _ which the courts have upheld.   As for nighttime programs, ``If we receive complaints ... thoseare being accepted and filed and put on hold until this whole matteris clarified,'' she said.   The rules apply only to over-the-air broadcasts, not cable.   Besides the NAB, those challenging the FCC rules were: CapitalCities-ABC; CBS; Action for Children's Television; the Associationof Independent Television Stations; the Radio and Television NewsDirectors Association; ACLU Foundation; Infinity Broadcast Corp.;the Motion Picture Association of America; NBC; National PublicRadio; the Pacifica Foundation; People for the Amercan Way;Post-Newsweek Stations; the Public Broadcasting Service; theReporters Committee for Freedom of the Press; and the Society ofProfessional Journalists.</TEXT></DOC>
