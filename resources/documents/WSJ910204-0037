The budget proposes savings of tens of billions of dollarsin defense spending over several years by stretching out orterminating nearly two dozen major weapons programs. Butreflecting the administration's longstanding support for somebig-ticket strategic weapons, Mr. Bush is preparing for anuphill battle to persuade Congress to spend more than $5.6billion next year to accelerate production of the B-2 Stealthbomber and step up research on ground-based and space-basedanti-missile defenses known as the Strategic DefenseInitiative.</LP><TEXT>   Overall, the budget calls for raising taxes less than $2billion over the next five years and shaving about $50billion from government benefit programs. Constrained by lastyear's deficit-reduction law and an apparent presidentialdecision to avoid major controversy on the home front, thebudget for fiscal 1992, which beings Oct. 1, includes fewmajor new initiatives, officials say.   However, the administration will propose cutting Medicarenearly $3 billion beyond the reductions in last year's lawand $24 billion over five years. The savings would come byfurther squeezing hospitals and doctors, the targets ofmoney-saving changes in Medicare that Congress approved lastyear.   Most of the Medicare proposals, such as reducing the extraallowance paid to teaching hospitals nearly $10 billion overfive years, are dusted-off proposals that the administrationmade unsuccessfully in 1990 budget talks with Congress.   &quot;This is dead before arrival,&quot; Frederick Graefe, aWashington hospital lobbyist, said of the Medicare proposals.   But the administration is making a new effort to limitgovernment benefits paid to upper-income Americans. It is,for instance, seeking to exclude farmers with substantialnon-farm income from agricultural subsidy programs and torestrict eligibility for federal student-aid grants to thelowest-income Americans.   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, appearing onNBC News's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; said the budget proposesreducing Medicare benefits for upper-income Americans, a movelikely to stir up controversy both among the organizedelderly and in Congress. He gave no details.   &quot;It would be somewhat ironic if Democrats, who areexpressing concern about fairness, are relucant to reduce thesubsidies for wealthier Americans,&quot; Mr. Darman said.   The administration also will propose rule changes thatwould make more pregnant women and children eligible forbenefits under the Medicaid health-insurance program for thepoor.   For the Pentagon, the budget provides scant reprieve fromthe long-range troop cuts and a spate of weaponscancellations touched off last year by the thaw inU.S.-Soviet relations. Congressional aides said the budget,among other things, would terminate construction of theNavy's Trident submarine, the Army's M-1 tank and Bradleyarmored troop carrier, and such Air Force programs as theF-16 Falcon jet and the highly classified Tacit Rainbowanti-radar missile.   The budget also seeks to shrink to 12 from 13 the Navy'sfleet of aircraft carriers, and proposes saving more than $13billion over the next six years by eliminating upgrades toGrumman Corp.'s F-14 jet fighters. The Pentagon's plans stillcall for a nearly 30% reduction in Army troop strength by thelate 1990s, along with smaller percentage cuts in Navy andAir Force personnel.   The budget's proposed defense spending of $295.2 billionin fiscal 1992 was set by last year's deficit-reduction lawand is $4 billion less than current spending levels. However,the administration may have to seek additional funds to coverthe cost of the Mideast war.   Administration and congressional officials also said thefiscal 1992 budget also includes these proposals.                                                                                                          Taxes: Overall, the budget proposes net revenue increasesof less than $2 billion over five years. In the major revenueraiser in his budget, Mr. Bush, once again, will seek tobring in about $1.7 billion in added annual receipts byextending the Medicare payroll tax to those state and localgovernment workers who are now exempt; many of those workersare eligible for Medicare because of other jobs or throughspouses. The budget includes tax breaks that theadministration says will cost $12 billion over the next fiveyears -- not counting the tab, if any, for Mr. Bush'sproposal to reduce capital-gains tax rates.                                                                                                          Student Aid: The maximum annual Pell Grant to students incollege or trade schools would be increased to $3,700 from$2,300, but only the lowest-income students would beeligible. In what is certain to be a controversial proposal,the administration would deny grants to many middle-incomestudents now eligible; they would still be eligible forloans.                                                                                                          Environment: The administration proposes a 7% increase to$2.5 billion in the Environmental Protection Agency'soperating budget, most of it to carry out last year'sclean-air legislation. The budget calls for a newenvironmental education office to focus on improvingscientific literacy in elementary and secondary schools.                                                                                                          Science: The administration's budget is expected toinclude a 13.5% increase in spending authority for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, including morethan $175 million for a new heavy-lift launch vehicle.National Science Foundation spending authority is expected toclimb more than 17%.                                                                                                          Unemployment Compensation: To help strapped stategovernments handle the mounting paperwork that accompanies anincrease in claimants for unemployment insurance, theadministration will seek an extra $100 million for thecurrent fiscal year and a further $178 million increase forfiscal 1992, bringing the total to $2.26 billion. The budgetproposes no changes in the jobless benefit program, which hasbeen under scrutiny because it covers a shrinking fraction ofthe unemployed.                                                                                                          Aid to States: White House Chief of Staff John Sununu,speaking behind closed doors to the National GovernorsAssociation, listed some of the federal grants to states thatthe administration would like to eliminate and replace withabout $15 billion a year in no-strings aid to states. Theyinclude grants to states for schools, sewer construction andadministering welfare and food-stamp programs. &quot;Whetherthey're funded under the old way, or combined into the blockgrant, the same dollars go with those programs,&quot; Mr. Sununusaid, promising the administration would &quot;not change thedollar amount one cent.&quot; The budget does include a proposedspending level for each grant program.                                                                                                          Transportation: In the budget and subsequent legislativeproposals, the administration will try to make states pay agreater share of highway projects, decreasing the top federalcontribution to 75% from 90% for everything except majormaintenance. Overall, the budget calls for spending almost$90 billion on highways, bridges and mass transit over thenext five years. Spending on mass transit would increase to$3.3 billion in fiscal 1992. One new wrinkle is to designate&quot;highways of national significance,&quot; both interstate andother roads deemed economically vital.                                                                                                          Nuclear Weapons: The budget includes funds to build onlyone new plant for producing tritium, a highly perishable gasthat enhances the power of nuclear bombs, to replace crippledfacilities at Savannah River, S.C. The Energy Department hadbeen seeking funds for two reactors, one in Idaho and one inSouth Carolina. The politically delicate task of choosing asite is deferred. A $1 billion program to use advanced lasertechnology to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons is beingshelved.   ---   David Rogers and Hilary Stout contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
