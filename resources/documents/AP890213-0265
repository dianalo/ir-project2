The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines declared Midwest Federalinsolvent and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as itsconservator under an interagency program announced by President Bushlast week.   It was the 11th savings and loan in the country to fall under theintervention program, aimed at stemming the tide of losses in thenation's thrift industry.   Midwest Federal Chairman Harold Greenwood Jr. and its managingofficer, Charlotte Massica, were named last week by U.S. AttorneyJerome Arnold of Minneapolis as among the targets of an FBIinvestigation into possible fraud at Midwest Federal.   Greenwood, Massica and two other Midwest Federal officialsresigned Monday, federal officials said.   Asked if the four executives had been fired, spokesman HassanHonarmand of the Des Moines home-loan bank said: ``You draw your ownconclusions. The new management team wanted to make a fresh start.''   Honarmand did say, however, that auditors for the Des Moines bankhad not uncovered any illegalities at Midwest Federal.   Honarmand said Greenwood and other Midwest Federal executiveswere cooperative. Greenwood, who has an unlisted home telephonenumber, could not be reached for comment.   Greenwood in the past has denied any wrongdoing by himself or anyother any officer or employee of Midwest Federal.   Thurman C. Connell, president of the Des Moines bank, saidMidwest Federal will continue to operate normally while federalregulators determine the extent of its financial difficulties anddevise a plan to solve them.   Martha Gravlee, deputy director of communications for the FederalHome Loan Bank Board, said ``the most likely scenario'' for rescuingthe thrift would include the use of federal funds.   Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad has proposed acquiring MidwestFederal with federal assistance, while others also have expressedinterest in bidding for the thrift.   Midwest Federal has $3.4 billion in assets and $2.3 billion indeposits.   According to the Des Moines bank, Monday's action wasprecipitated by a report from auditors that in the fourth quarter of1988, Midwest Federal lost about $200 million from loans itpurchased from Green Tree Acceptance Corp., a former Midwest Federalsubsidiary.   Green Tree's chief financial officer, John Brink, said in aninterview Monday that he didn't understand how Midwest Federal couldlose that amount on the loan package.   ``It certainly isn't fair to blame all of Midwest Federal'sproblems on Green Tree Acceptance,'' Brink said.   Honarmand said the full amount of red ink at Midwest Federal willnot be known until an audit of 1988's books is complete in a fewweeks.</TEXT></DOC>
