Hard.    He is selling computers. He is selling pasta. He is selling financial services, insurance, auto parts and perfume. He is also selling himself in persuading European investors to back him in selling all of the above.    But most of all, he is selling ideas.    Example: &quot;Technology is destroying time and space, the two remaining barriers for the human being,&quot; he says.    Or: &quot;In the third industrial revolution, the actors are victims at the same time.&quot;    And especially: &quot;All businesses today have to solve an impossible economic equation. How to amortize the higher development costs of new products over their increasingly shorter lives. Globalization is the only answer.&quot;    Translated into action, these ideas mean that companies must have strong local units selling the same products everywhere at the same time, that risk must be diversified geographically as well as by product mix, and that because everyone now has instant access to the same information, salesmen can no longer be just salesmen.    Ideas like this, and their corresponding actions, take a lot of selling. But if anybody can do it, it is Mr. De Benedetti, the 52-year-old chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co., who during the past decade has transformed a near-bankrupt typewriter maker into Europe's leading personal-computer company and has extended tentacles into the U.S. and Japan. He has also transformed himself from the proprietor of a 50-person metal-pipe company into one of Europe's richest men. Using his new-found influence, he is preaching the gospel of globalization.    The stakes: &quot;For an Italian, survival,&quot; he says, settling down for a few hours in his Milan office, his eyes frequently darting to a monitor displaying the current prices of a couple of dozen of the companies he controls or has invested in.    &quot;A business must increasingly feel comfortable in Europe, Japan and the U.S., all at once,&quot; he says, clicking the top of a felt-tipped pen as he speaks rapid-fire, lightly accented English. &quot;It's really another life.&quot;    When Carlo De Benedetti expounds ideas about time and space that seem far removed from 1987 Italy, many people pay attention. If he can get the 55,000 employees of Olivetti behind him and keep behind him a cross section of the world's stockbrokers, who have backed his huge stable of private investments, Mr. De Benedetti's ideas may become models for new-style multinational companies built around local expertise rather than imported marketing muscle.    He is &quot;an empire builder,&quot; says Guido Roberto Vitale, the president of Euromobiliare S.p.A., a leading Italian investment bank and a longtime friend of Mr. De Benedetti's. &quot;It is the aim of his life to play an ever-growing European role.&quot; Mr. Vitale adds: &quot;Businessmen are building Europe at a faster pace than are the politicians, and Italians are probably doing this more than other businessmen.&quot;    Olivetti isn't the first company with a global concept, by any means. Toyota Motor Co., the Japanese auto maker, has gained market share in the U.S. through its joint venture with General Motors Corp., and Xerox Corp. has for decades operated joint ventures with Rank Organisation PLC in Europe and Fuji Photo Film in Japan. Mr. De Benedetti, moreover, concedes he isn't the only computer maker who sees a shift in focus from hardware to selling services and solutions. &quot;What I'm saying isn't very original,&quot; he says.    Italian companies as diverse as sugar-maker Ferruzzi Group and telephone maker Italtel S.p.A. are following similar strategies, and all expect many other European companies to follow. &quot;We must have alliances to become big enough to compete with the Americans and the Japanese,&quot; says Marisa Bellisario, Italtel's chairman. Raul Gardini, the chairman of Ferruzzi, adds, &quot;Attaining the scale of Continental Europe is our only chance.&quot;    This pan-European push, Mr. De Benedetti says, is being led by Italians because &quot;we have no natural raw materials here except brains.&quot; But it is risky. Alliances such as that between Olivetti and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. aren't always especially successful.    Previous solo assaults on the American market by Olivetti have failed. Mr. De Benedetti's forays into France have been met with varying degrees of protectionism and horror. He says he isn't big enough to take his private holding company into West Germany -- and may never be. All the equity-raising in Milan gave that stock market indigestion last year.    &quot;De Benedetti wants to build in one generation what the Agnellis {of Fiat S.p.A.} did in 100 years,&quot; says a longtime colleague. &quot;He is building his fortune on other people's equity.&quot; A Paris stockbroker who requests anonymity adds, &quot;It's a little bit of a house of cards. It can work only so long as the market is bullish and the companies are prosperous.&quot;    But to Mr. De Benedetti, the real risk is standing pat. &quot;We may be as a group,&quot; he says, &quot;incapable of changing our skins&quot; from sellers of office equipment to sellers of solutions and services.    Mr. De Benedetti knows he can raise money because of his three-year transformation of Olivetti into a world-class office-machine company. This feat has vaulted him into the Pantheon of Italian business. A recent poll of 2,000 Italian business students named the executive the country's most popular businessman and Olivetti the company most would want to work for, ahead of Mr. De Benedetti's one-time boss, Gianni Agnelli of Fiat.    After managing what he calls his &quot;textbook turnaround&quot; at Olivetti, Mr. De Benedetti created a private investment company, Compagnia Finanziaria De Benedetti S.p.A., or Cofide. It started with a few Olivetti shares and now is valued at $854 million, raised mainly from bankers in Milan, Paris, Frankfurt and London on the basis of his name. He owns 51%.    But still not content to rest on his laurels, Mr. De Benedetti is hurrying to transform both Olivetti and Cofide into two very different kinds of world players. His actions, he says, are based on a simple analysis: Exports are becoming obsolete, because they are too slow. Marketers must sell the latest product everywhere at once, and that means producing locally. Technology companies, in particular, must sell solutions to problems, not just hardware or software.    Mr. De Benedetti says his motives are simple. &quot;Olivetti is a pure mission; Cofide is a way to make money as a measure of success, to prove that Olivetti was no fluke.&quot; He also insists that despite assured material comfort and fame beyond his dreams, he is basically insecure. &quot;Everyone needs confirmation,&quot; he says.    For Mr. De Benedetti, such confirmation will come with the acceptance of his ideas among his employees and investors. But he is the first to concede that such concepts as the &quot;annulization of time and space&quot; and &quot;globalization&quot; aren't well understood by most managers, including his own managers in Olivetti. He is trying to sell the ideas hard both inside and outside the company.    He is trying to &quot;take Olivetti across the river,&quot; he says, to become a problem solver equally at home in Europe, Japan and the U.S., instead of a medium-sized Italian computer maker. To do this he has linked with ATandamp;T in the U.S. and Canon Inc. in Japan. But he is also spending a lot of time convincing Olivetti salesmen, accustomed to slashing prices and fighting old-rival International Business Machines Corp., that the new competitors will be information-oriented companies like American Airlines and GM that will sell the skills they have learned computerizing their own businesses.    Olivetti's indoctrination program touches everyone from top managers to assembly-line workers. Key executives are taken to Olivetti's training school in Haslemere, England, where they spend two grueling weeks with colleagues from around the world translating Mr. De Benedetti's ideas into practical plans. Teachers, culled from top business schools in Europe and the U.S., undergo intense training themselves before they are allowed to spread the word to executives. The message is then filtered down the ranks, through sales-training seminars, quality-control symposiums and pure osmosis.    The idea is to get Olivetti employees &quot;to stop building and selling boxes and become problem solvers,&quot; Mr. De Benedetti says. Banks, he adds, &quot;no longer care how many boxes we sell them or what shape or color they are. They want us to clear up their back-office mess or reorganize their accounts.&quot;    For Olivetti salesmen, this has meant a new focus on services and software instead of hardware, and the creation of a unit called Oliservice, which provides programming, maintenance and supplies. &quot;The sale of computers is a volatile thing,&quot; says Odoardo Maggi, an Olivetti international marketing executive, and a Haslemere alumnus. &quot;Selling solutions puts the company in a position of stronger relations with the client. It's like a marriage -- not impossible to break, but not easy.&quot;    Olivetti recently won a contract to install a network of automatic teller machines in Finland. The deal was clinched, Mr. Maggi says, not so much by Olivetti's machines but rather by its assurances that servicemen would fix machines even in the snowiest reaches of Finland.    Meanwhile, Mr. De Benedetti has taken Olivetti beyond Italy's shores. He took over ailing West German typewriter maker Triumph Adler, British computer maker Acorn PLC and the French computer company Logabax, and he launched Olivetti-style turnaround programs at all three. These consist of &quot;classic&quot; tactics of cutting costs and staff, he says.    Separately, Mr. De Benedetti concluded that Olivetti, having been burned badly in past attempts to sell either typewriters or computers in the U.S., needed a wealthy, native partner both there and in Japan. He found ATandamp;T in the U.S., which bought 25% of Olivetti in April 1984 and through which Olivetti sold about 170,000 personal computers last year. This alliance wasn't very successful in marketing computers in the competitive U.S. market, however, and ATandamp;T last year handed over to Olivetti all responsibility for selling and making personal computers in the U.S.    In Japan, Mr. De Benedetti linked up early this year with Canon to jointly produce copiers in Europe. The agreement will give Olivetti access to the Japanese firm's advanced laser-printer technology.    Mr. De Benedetti is building up Cofide's global strategy, using locally run units that have stunned Italy and France with takeovers and may soon do the same in Spain and Great Britain.    Cofide's splashiest coup was the acquisition of 37% of Yves Saint Laurent S.A. and the arranging of $631 million in financing to allow the fashion designer to buy back his perfume brands from Squibb Corp. This was accomplished by a combination of decisiveness and pure theater.    &quot;Mr. De Benedetti is an artist,&quot; says Pierre Berge, Mr. Saint Laurent's partner, sitting in his office underneath an Andy Warhol screenprint of the designer. &quot;He has the ability and need to make quick decisions. I flew down to Milan for lunch and we had an agreement. Not a comma needed to be changed later. He's got a vision, he's got emotions,&quot; says Mr. Berge, &quot;not like a lot of our French financiers.&quot;    Cofide's French unit, called Cerus, is run by Alain Minc, a well-known French executive, as a French company exhibiting un-French aggression. Its interests, amassed in less than a year, include auto parts and publishing besides fashion. Mr. De Benedetti hopes soon to clone Cerus elsewhere in Europe, probably in Spain and Great Britain.    &quot;It doesn't make sense to be Italian and fully invested in Italy. It's obsolete,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to offer a basket of investments that are diversified geographically and according to risk.&quot; So his Italian holding company Cia. Industriale Riunite, or CIR, holds both high-risk, high-growth Olivetti stock and low-growth but stable pasta maker Buitoni. Further Italian investments include auto parts, insurance, publishing and financial services, in which Cofide recently set up a partnership with Shearson Lehman Brothers of the U.S.    &quot;We are country-sized, trying to be Europe-sized,&quot; Mr. De Benedetti says. After that, though, the rivers get tougher to cross. &quot;We are still too small, too weak,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't make the jump now to a continent like the U.S.&quot;    He may never do it, he says: &quot;I don't think I'll try for a third career.&quot; But neither is he about to slow down. He is a young 52, with just a few streaks of gray lining his jet-black hair. &quot;After three weeks in Bermuda he would have a nervous breakdown,&quot; says his friend Mr. Vitale. &quot;He needs a constant challenge.&quot;    ---             Major Holdings of De Benedetti   Some of Carlo De Benedetti's major holdings, held throughvarious holding companies.
