(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of the National Associationof Evangelicals said Wednesday colleges have undergone such aradical transformation from their religious beginnings that manyare now systematically undermining Christian values.   ``Many institutions of higher learning have surrendered theethical and moral sanctions upon which they were built,'' Ray H.Hughes told delegates attending the group's convention here.   They have been cut off from their ``deep roots in the Christianfaith'' and offer up a wide range of ideologies,``cafeteria-style,'' he said.   However, he said, the evangelical schools that were founded as adefense to materialism and secular teachings are themselves movingaway from their basic religious foundations and are in danger ofbecoming ``pale carbon copies'' of those secular colleges.   Evangelical colleges have to return to the principles ofspiritual commitment, Hughes said, because the nation faces ``ageneration of students for whom much in life has lost its meaning,for whom morality has lost its moorings.''   The organization, which represents more than 50,000 churchesfrom 72 Protestant denominations, is holding a series of workshopsand seminars on the theme ``Go Teach.''   Among the speakers is the Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Thursdayspeech will address television evangelism and its problems.   U.S. Education Secretary William J. Bennett told the groupearlier that he was angry about the well-publicized scandalsinvolving television preachers.   ``It doesn't help my cause to teach moral values when those whospeak the loudest cannot live up to their own beliefs,'' Bennettsaid Tuesday.   Another speaker, M. Wayne Benson, senior pastor of the FirstAssembly of God Church in Grand Rapids, Mich., warned his audienceto be careful during these ``perilous days.''   ``It's a deception of Satan to think that any ministry is abovehuman frailty,'' Benson said.   Benson, Bennett, Hughes and others named no names and avoidedany discussion of the latest scandal in evangelism broadcasting.Famed TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart stepped down from his pulpitlast month after tearfully telling his congregation he had sinned;published reports said he paid a prostitute to pose naked for him.   Falwell, who is not a member of the National Association ofEvangelicals, will speak to the organization for the first time. Heaccepted an invitation from the National Religious Broadcasters, amember group of the NAE which last month adopted a stringent codeof ethics for its 1,350 member organizations.   Several hundred voting delegates of the NAE approved a number ofresolutions of faith, including one on illegal drugs that supportsefforts of the President and Mrs. Reagan in calling for ``anall-out war to end this travesty.''</TEXT></DOC>
