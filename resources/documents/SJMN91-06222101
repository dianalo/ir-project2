I am compelled todissent lest tomorrow it be entombed in ice,&quot; Justice Michael Golden said.;   In overturning a lower court's summary judgment in favor of the magazine andpublisher Larry Flynt, the high court said &quot;a public figure is not subject todefamatory attack and criticism just because he is a public figure.&quot;;   Neither Spence nor lawyers for the magazine were available for commentThursday.;    Spence sued Hustler for $150 million for naming him its &quot;Assholeof the Month&quot; for July 1985.;    The award, given by the magazine to peoplewhose actions it finds offensive, stemmed from Spence's agreement to representan anti-pornography activist in her lawsuit against Hustler.;    In that case,Andrea Dworkin claimed that sexually explicit photographs and caricatures inHustler libeled her and invaded her privacy.;    The U.S. Supreme Court in1989 refused to consider Dworkin's $150 million lawsuit, agreeing with the 9thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Hustler's references were opinion and thusprotected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.;    In Spence'slawsuit against Hustler, the five-member Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that thelawyer, although widely known, might have been acting solely in the capacityof a private attorney in representing Dworkin.;    &quot;The statements by Hustlerabout Spence are clearly defamatory, for they are such as would hold him up tohatred, contempt or ridicule. Unless they are protected defamatory criticismof a public figure, they are actionable, and Spence should be allowed topursue his claim,&quot; read the majority opinion by Justice G. Joseph Cardine.;   &quot;Larry Flynt is not free to arise each morning and select a public figure toattack and defame for no reason at all.&quot;;    A trial is necessary to determinewhether Spence himself was taking a public stand against pornography inagreeing to represent Dworkin, Cardine wrote.;    &quot;The controversy here isDworkin's fight against pornography. Hustler's argument is structured upon theproposition that Spence has taken up the fight against pornography, thrusthimself into the controversy as a public figure, and is therefore subject toresponse by persons taking the other side,&quot; the justice wrote.;    &quot;Spence mayor may not, in fact, be personally opposed to pornography.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Cheyenne, Wyo.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910809  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  433  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 9, 199100222101,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
