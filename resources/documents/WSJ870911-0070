Why else would he let his dislike of corporate takeovers interfere with honest government and sensible economics?    Senator Proxmire's Banking Committee decided to punish the Office of the Economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission for doing its job. The economists have done pathbreaking studies on the effects of takeover bids (rapid rises in share prices), poison pills (shares fall) and the relationship between arbitragers and insider trading (minimal). A Proxmire committee study has now blamed the SEC for allowing the &quot;limitations inherent in an econometric approach to regulatory matters to erode its willingness to . . . address problems that are not amenable to econometric measurement.&quot;    As Jonathan Macey wrote on this page yesterday, the scholarly studies produced answers Senator Proxmire didn't like. So he is bullying the econonomists by withholding from them any of the agency's budget increase and threatens that they will get no funding at all unless they shape up.    SEC economists have restrained agency prosecutors who don't always understand how markets work, but what probably set off Senator Proxmire's rage was a recently released memo by Annette Poulsen, acting head of the Office of the Economist. She was responding to his witch hunt of last winter when he demanded bizarre information from Wall Street.    Senator Proxmire asked the big investment banks for their gross revenue and net profits from arbitrage for the past three years, arbitrage's portion of total revenue and income, the total compensation for each firm's five highest paid arbs and &quot;the total compensation of the highest paid individual.&quot; The banks were shocked at this invasion of privacy of their employees. After months of lobbying, committee staffers agreed to &quot;sanitized&quot; data to protect anonymity.    Ms. Poulsen's memo on Senator Proxmire's queries on arbitrage profits shows that after all the hoopla, he didn't get a smoking gun. Ms. Poulson reported that almost all the profits from the takeovers of the past few years went to the shareholders, not to the arbs. &quot;Over the three-year period 1984-86 risk arbitragers have captured less than three percent, and perhaps as little as one percent, of the total profits earned by stockholders in acquisitions of public companies, restructurings, and other similar transactions,&quot; she wrote. She noted that the data Senator Proxmire had asked for were incomplete -- Ivan Boesky was not included -- but concluded that arbs are bit players when it comes to the profits in takeovers.    It's no surprise that shareholders are the main winners from takeovers. Whether individually or through pensions, many Americans turn to the stock markets for long-term investments. When one of the companies whose stock they own becomes a takeover target, the price rises and they can either wait for a new owner or sell at a profit. If they are unsure whether a takeover will succeed because of defensive tactics, they can sell to arbs willing to take the risk that the deal falls through. Former SEC economist Michael Jensen estimates that since 1981, the total value to shareholders from takeovers is about $100 billion.    Senator Proxmire's Tender Offer Fairness and Disclosure Act goes to his committee next week. It would chill hostile takeovers. Acquirers would have to disclose within one day when they have 3% of the shares of a target. The law introduces a new definition of the group subject to disclosure, to include anyone &quot;acting in concert or in a consciously parallel manner.&quot; This could mean that anyone trading on any rumor could be taken to court. All this would discourage anyone from taking the risk of a takeover bid because so few of the profits would accrue to the raider, and the chances of a successful bid would dim. Fewer takeovers means fewer takeover profits for shareholders.    &quot;It is not my intention to rob shareholders,&quot; Senator Proxmire has said. &quot;Yet if we are to make a choice about this issue, I acknowledge that shareholder rights cannot be paramount in the management of the nation's economy.&quot; This must be what he meant by &quot;problems that are not amenable to econometric measurement.&quot; Senator Proxmire is more interested in bashing the arbs and protecting incumbent managers than giving shareholders their due reward for investing in the free market.    We continue to be astonished that liberals have somehow been transformed into lapdogs for business interests on one side of an economic issue. Before Senator Proxmire persuades congressmen to sign on to his anti-takeover bill, they should recall that shareholders also vote. </TEXT></DOC>
