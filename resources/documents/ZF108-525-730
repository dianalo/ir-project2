(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SHORT HAUL TOOLSandM;AMERICAN LASER SYSTEMSandM;American Laser (Goleta, CA) makes infrared-based short-haul stuff.andP;  There aretwo big benefits with short-haul infrared links.andP;  One, you don't have to dealwith FCC licensing.andP;  It's not required.andP;  Second, the equipment is relativelyeasy to set up.andM;There are two products you should know about here.andP;  One of their systems isprimarily for setting up an invisible video channel and the other is for aT-1 span.andM;The 761 Video Transmission System transmits one channel for video and audioup to one mile (standard infrared distance).andP;  It's for teleconferencing in acampus environment, electronic news gathering by broadcasters, CCTV,security, etc.andP;  Anytime a video signal is needed point-to-point within amile, it's a solution.andM;Their ALS851-T1 transmits standard T-1 and European T-1 (2.048 Mbps) up toone mile.andP;  Again, a nice answer in campus environments, especially in LANapplications.andM;Pricing for this stuff isn't too shabby.andP;  The 761 system, for bothtransmitter and receiver, goes for under $8,000.andP;  The T-1 setup goes for$14,000.andP;  Again, that number is for both ends of the hop.andM;DIGITAL MICROWAVEandM;DMC's (San Jose, CA) microwave radios have been kicking butt for awhile now.andO;Indeed, they're definitely leaders in the short-haul market.andM;It seems a week doesn't go by when there's no news from Digital Microwave: anew overseas deal, wherein their radios are being gobbled up by foreign PTCs;deals with cellular providers (very hot); shipment of their 10,000th product;distribution deals; a line of fiber optic-compatible products; new improvedradios; enhanced network management package; etc.andM;We don't have enough time to go into everything, including detailing theirbroad line of excellent products.andP;  Suffice to say, their products stand upever so nicely in the market.andM;What we'd like to go into here is an innovative disaster recovery programthey're offering.andP;  Note: short-haul microwave is an excellent solution indisaster situations.andM;OK.andP;  Their program is called Rapid Equipment Deployment (RED).andP;  Prettycatchy, huh?andP;  It guarantees shipment, within 24 hours, of microwavecommunications equipment for emergency restoral in case of fire, flood orother natural disasters.andM;To play requires a 15% down payment with the balance due upon delivery of theequipment plus a monthly maintenance fee for continued storage andmaintenance of the system.andP;  The RED program includes all stuff, both radiosand ancillary equipment, needed for temporary communications until permanentcommunications can be restored.andM;DMC set this program up after they realized how good they were at it.andP;  Listento Bill Gibson, DMC's president and CEO (and a snappy dresser) -- &quot;Wedeveloped a lot of experience and expertise in providing emergency restoralequipment on a short turnaround basis.andP;  In May of '88 we shipped 42 links of18 and 23 GHz digital microwave radios to Hinsdale, Illinois.andP;  Also, duringthe fire season, we have on call complete systems that are sent in a matterof hours to the US Forest Service.&quot;andM;DMC just organized and packaged something they were already doingsuccessfully.andP;  Just another smart move by a very smart company.andM;LASER COMMUNICATIONSandM;Laser Communications (Lancaster, PA) provides products that use aninteresting short haul technology: infrared laser.andP;  Their LCI LACE (LaserAtmospheric Communications) product line is able to transmit high speed data,audio and video.andM;As we mentioned before, infrared technology is similar to microwave in thatit involves signals sent through the air and requires line-of-sight, butinfrared transmission does not require a licence from the FCC.andM;The LACE line is big in LAN connection products.andP;  They have both a LACE LaserEthernet Link at 10 Mbps and a LACE Laser Token Ring Link at 4 Mbps.andP;  Theline also features the LACE Laser T-1/T-2 Link which can do 1.544 to 6.312Mbps.andM;This T-1/T-2 model lets you go from T-1 to T-2 through an M1-2 multiplexerinterface.andP;  You can upgrade your networking capacity without increasing yourline costs.andP;  The company also notes that the system is totally protocoltransparent, portable enough to use for disaster recovery and can be used inhigh EMF environments.andM;M/A-COMandM;The MA-23VX from M/A-COM (Chelmsford, MA) is a 23 GHz microwave system forthe short-range transmission of video signals.andP;  The system can be customizedfor surveillance, CCTV, teleconferencing or studio-to-transmitter links.andM;The 23VX's modular design lets you create the exact system you need.andP;  Thesimplex system carries video and subcarrier signals in one direction only,and is suitable for simple surveillance.andP;  The duplex system carries thesignal (video, subcarrier, or both) in two directions for teleconferencingapplications.andM;Up to two subcarriers may be used to carry audio, RS-422 or RS-232 data.andO;These can be used for intercom, camera controls, telephone or fax channels.andM;The system's one-foot antenna, with a gain of 33 dB, is ideal for most&quot;campus&quot; style locations and covers a distance of three to five miles.andP;  Atwo-foot antenna, with a system gain of 40 dB, may be used to providecoverage of five to eight miles.andP;  An optional four-foot antenna that willcover up to 12 miles is also available.andM;All video and subcarrier connections are conveniently located on the rearpanel of the system control unit, which contains the power supply anddiagnostic circuitry.andP;  Front panel status indicators display systemperformance at a glance.andM;MICROWAVE DATAandM;SYSTEMSandM;Microwave Data Systems (East Rochester, NY) is a subsidiary of CaliforniaMicrowave.andP;  They make both multiple address and point-to-point 900 MHzmicrowave systems.andP;  In fact, they have installed over 8,000 of their MDS 1000radios in the four years they've been in existence.andM;This popular MDS 1000 features a &quot;Smart&quot; Master Station which features remotediagnostic capability.andP;  Built-in diagnostic readings are sent via a 25-pindata connector to an MDS programmer/test set, an IBM PC or a terminal.andM;The company is also proud-to-bursting of he intermode rejection, spur andimage rejection and sensitivity of their receivers.andP;  The unit is programmablein 6.25 KHz increments so it can handle 12.5 KHz to 25 KHz for a variety ofapplications.andM;MICROWAVE NETWORKSandM;Microwave Networks (Houston, TX), like Digital Microwave, is one of theleaders in short-haul microwave technology.andP;  They recently introduced anothermember to their illustrious product line.andM;The MicroNet 4DS1/8DS1 Radio -- at 15, 18 and 23 GHz -- provides low tomedium transmission of T-1 circuits for short distance applications.andO;Expansion from four T-1 to eight T-1 capacity and from non-protected to hotstandby operation is accomplished by simply plugging in modular, well,modules.andP;  We saw this stuff at a tradeshow.andP;  It is easy.andM;A complete network management system for the radio links, which may beaccessed from the front panel of any radio in the system or by remoteterminal, is included standard, as well as built-in T-1 BERT (bit-error ratetest).andM;Other standard features include extra service and control channels for systemnetwork management, reverse channel protection and various options of lownoise and high-power amplifiers to get high system gain.andP;  Further, MicrowaveNetworks, like DMC, has been selling a lot of stuff to cellular providers.andO;This new line of radios, you can bet, is going to do quite nicely in thatmarket.andM;The MicroNet 4DS1/8DS1 is priced from $15,000.andM;MOTOROLAandM;Motorola's (Schaumburg, IL) Ultrastar 18 DLR digital microwave radio operatesin the 18 GHz band and provides the capacity to handle four independent DS-1signals simultaneously.andP;  It also offers standard digital interfaces of DS-2,CEPT-1, CEPT-2 or 4xCEPT-1 for international use.andP;  Available in bothnon-switch-over (maximum gain 102 dB) and hot-switch-over (maximum gain 99dB) configurations, the systems ensure complete redundancy.andM;The 18 DLR radio features synthesized Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) foreasy frequency changes in the field and the elimination offrequency-dependent components.andP;  Modular construction allows field servicingwithout the need for special tools or removal of the system.andP;  A standardintegral data tester helps to confirm microwave link integrity for efficientinstallation and maintenance.andM;Built-in diagnostics features such as convenient front panel displays quicklyidentify communications problems.andP;  The LEDs also provide comprehensive alarmmonitoring of the transmitter, receiver and modem.andM;System applications include short-haul point-to-point transmission of data(both synchronous and asynchronous) and digitized voice, spur-route feeders,remote data processing, trunking, disaster recovery and cellular phonetrunking.andM;Rockwell's MDR-3x18 Microwave Digital Radio is available now through NorthSupply (Industrial Airport, KS).andM;The series operates in the 17.7 to 19.7 GHz band and comes in three versionsfor various capacity requirements.andP;  The product line interfaces DS-1 or DS-3signals.andP;  Its primary application, like so much of today's microwave stuff,is cashing in on the demand for digital service (especially T-1) and theemergence of so much CPE with direct T-1 interfaces.andM;RACONandM;The Micropass 8500 series of FM microwave equipment from Racon (Seattle, WA)provides full-motion, duplex video, voice and data transmission up to 15miles.andM;Features of the series include a typical system gain of 169 dB, choice ofone, two or four-foot antenna and an optional 24VDC or 240VAC power supply.andO;The high performance radio operates in the 21.2 to 23.6 GHz frequency bandand is built for future expansion capabilities.andM;Because they use FM, the Micropass units provide optimum path realiability atgreater distances.andP;  They are less susceptible to noise interference fromother power sources, including electrical storms.andM;Used in hundreds of large and small companies throughout the country,Micropass applications range from simple gate surveillance to complex linkageof a space telescope to remote facilities.andP;  The Los Angeles InternationalAirport employs Micropass equipment for video security and ground operations.andO;The systems are also used by industrial and government users forvideoconferencing, and by school districts for distance learning.andM;A full duplex NTSC video system lists for $11,900.andM;TELCO SYSTEMSandM;Fiber optics.andP;  Not transparent signalling, but light.andP;  That's what we'retalking about with Telco System's (Norwood, MA) FOX-2 XTra fiber distributionsystem.andM;The XTra part stands for the added capabilities to their previous FOX-2system -- eXtended Temperature, Range and Alarm.andP;  Overall, the new systemdoes the same thing as the old one.andP;  It simplifies and reduces the cost ofextending fiber-based service to residential and office park customers, evenin rural applications.andM;Yes, the FOX-2 XTra product line extends the operational performance ofTelco's well-received FOX-2 family.andP;  FOX-2 is a 6 Mbps fiber distributionsystem used to provide direct optical extension of up to four DS-1s from a COor fiber hub to a customer's premise or other remote location.andM;The FOX-2 family includes the T-HUB optical T-1 distribution system and theFOX-2 (wall-mount) or FOX-2R (rack-mount) units.andP;  The XTra product groupincludes:andM;* hardened or extended operating temperature (40 below zero F to 150 abovezero F) version of the FOX-2R (rack-mount) and associated cards;andM;* high-power laser Line Terminating Unit (LTU) cards to provide increasedsystem gain of 27 dB, 31 dB or 37 dB for added reach in the loop;andM;* Remote Alarm Card III (RAC III) to provide 29 output contact closures,associated with four distinct external inputs per FOX-2 extension plus onecommon external input;andM;* new MPU and MPU II cards with added firmware to provide FOX-2 TBOS serialinterface for alarm reporting and control of each FOX-2 extension (networkmanagement is very important here, as you can imagine).andM;Applications for 6 Mbps fiber distribution such as this can be found anywheresomeone wants fiber-based delivery of DS-1 service.andP;  (We do!andP;  We do!)andP;  TheFOX-2 family is ideally suited in applications requiring optical extension ofDS-1 service in an office park, campus or other local distribution areas.andM;FOX-2 can be tweaked to handle many different applications, including: starhubbing (which lets you move from a copper network to fiber without changingthe star topologies of the embedded network); rural fiber-based distribution(where one fiber cable sheath can supply POTS to a bunch of people); lowcapacity POTS feeder and T-1 service provisioning; etc.andP;  Their applicationexperts are dying for you to talk to them.andM;Obviously, there's a lot of stuff that can go into one of these systems.andO;Telco makes a host of fiber-related products, including regenerators thatkeep system gain high in long fiber spans and SONET (a fiber standard you'llbe learning quite a bit about) products that provide a logical migration pathto this up and coming fiber network.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
