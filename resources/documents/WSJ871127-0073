The cuts, ranging from 5% to 15%, were part of a series of cost-cutting measures undertaken Aug. 1 after Dravo sustained heavy losses resulting largely from cost overruns on construction projects.    In a letter to employees, William G. Roth, chairman and president, said Dravo was rescinding the pay cuts because the company now is positioned &quot;for a return to profitability.&quot; Mr. Roth's own 25% pay cut -- the largest at the company -- remains in effect.    Other austerity measures also remain in force. They include a hiring freeze, a freeze on salaries below $25,000 and suspension of corporate contributions to employee-savings plans. The measures affect about 2,700 salaried employees.    Dravo is an engineering, construction and raw materials concern. </TEXT></DOC>
