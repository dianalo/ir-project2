Should one faction of the nation's sprawling 4.2million-man military forces take up arms against another, theresulting civil war would be fought against the ominousbackdrop of some 27,000 nuclear warheads in bases dottedacross the vast expanses of the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   But the experts see little immediate danger of a broadercrisis involving nuclear weapons. In fact, Soviet controlsover their nuclear weapons have become so elaborate andcentralized during the past 10 years that the chaos of a coupmight have temporarily shut down Soviet long-range nuclearweapons.   &quot;One of the questions we wonder about is what happened tothe guy that has Mr. Gorbachev's codes,&quot; said Stephen Meyer,an arms control expert at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. The carrier of nuclear launch codes who followedMr. Gorbachev performed much the same function as the U.S.officer who carries &quot;the football&quot; and accompanies PresidentBush, he notes.   Without a coded signal from Mr. Gorbachev, along with aseparate coded signal from the head of the Soviet Ministry ofDefense, the Soviet missiles would &quot;essentially be grounded,&quot;according to Mr. Meyer.   A greater worry, he says, is the custody of thousands ofsmaller, nuclear-tipped missiles, bombs and artillery shellsduring a civil war involving military units on both sides.These &quot;tactical&quot; nuclear weapons couldn't be used against theU.S., but could be devastating if employed in a civil war.   Many of these weapons are also believed to be difficult touse because they are protected by complex electronic codesheld by many lower-level officials, according to severalexperts on the Soviet system. &quot;I doubt if commanders wouldwant to use them anyway,&quot; said Mr. Meyer. &quot;In a civil warit's really sort of like blowing up your house to controlants.&quot;   Yet civil wars have a way of becoming bloody andirrational. The crisis in Moscow has that potential,according to Charles Dick, director of Soviet StudiesResearch Center at the British Royal Military Academy,because the Soviet army is riven by a generation gap betweenyounger and older officers and by feuds between hundreds ofdifferent ethnic groups within military units.   &quot;They have been able to cope so far by using specialtroops of the MVD {Ministry of Internal Affairs} and by usingairborne troops, but if the situation becomes larger-scaleand you start using the typical Soviet motorized rifle unit,then the Soviet leaders will run into a very sizableproblem,&quot; says Mr. Dick.   Col. David Glantz, director of a U.S. Army center at FortLeavenworth, Kan., that studies the Soviet army, says theU.S. has seen signs in recent weeks of newly formed,specialized units from the MVD that seemed to be designed tocarry out a tougher internal security mission in Moscow.   The takeover in Moscow, he says, appears to have beenlargely carried out by the MVD with the assistance of eliteSoviet army airborne units, whose bases ring the Sovietcapital. These units, along with KGB units, have recruitedveterans of the war in Afghanistan and other militaryspecialists, which means that they might hold together betteramid the chaos of Russian fighting Russian. The best-known ofthe new units is the MVD's so-called &quot;black berets&quot; or OMANunits, a Russian acronym for &quot;Special Designation MilitiaDetachments.&quot;   The coup, believes Col. Glantz, shows that there is a newlinkage between the MVD and the Red Army high command, whichhas previously taken great pains to keep its troops out ofinternal conflicts. Col. Glantz says he believed the linkagehas been provided by Gen. Boris Gromov, the last Sovietcommander in Afghanistan, who shifted to the No. 2 post atthe Ministry of Internal Affairs last November.   &quot;Since then, there has been an explosion in the authorityof MVD forces,&quot; he says.   But the MVD is believed to have only 72,000 operationaltroops and would be unable to contain an uprising thatquickly spread beyond the bounds of Moscow. &quot;The interestingthing is what will happen in areas where you have strikes andcontrol is looser,&quot; Mr. Meyer says.   &quot;There have been questions for some time about the faultlines in the Soviet military,&quot; says Edward L. Warner, aSoviet military analyst at Rand Corp. He points to recentstudies showing that the commanders of line units in theSoviet army, the younger captains and lieutenants, are muchmore sympathetic to Mr. Gorbachev's reforms than their moresenior commanders.   Meanwhile, there have been beatings and other forms ofdiscrimination within enlisted ranks, pitting Slavs againstethnic minorities. In a country that has over 250 separategroups, the strife has seriously weakened the discipline ofthe Red Army.   The recent proliferation of new elite units has probablyfurther complicated relations between military units, someU.S. experts believe. &quot;It is certainly conceivable that therecould be clashes between different elements of the military.There are so many different components here that it's hard toknow how they keep all of them in one single command aftersuch a radical change,&quot; says Robert C. Nurick, another RandCorp. analyst.</TEXT></DOC>
