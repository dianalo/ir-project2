The curfew idea drew immediate criticism from civil libertarianswho called it an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom, but Flynnsaid parents have to be made accountable for their children.   ``I'm going to talk to parents, young kids, community leadersand see whether or not there's something we can put in place thatholds parents responsible for the behavior of their children,particularly in the wee hours of the morning,'' Flynn said.   Authorities alleged that the rape and murder of 26-year-oldKimberly Rae Harbour was committed by a gang of teen-agers roamingthe streets in search of women to rob. Eight black tee-agers werearrested this week.   Flynn suggested a system similar to the curfew put in place thisweek in Atlanta, where youths under 18 hanging around on streetcorners or in public places are arrested and turned over to thecustody of their parents.   He said that if he decides to start a curfew, he would make iteffective in the spring, when warming weather draws more peopleoutside.   The Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,like its Georgia counterpart, promised to challenge a curfew incourt.   ``There is no way to equitably enforce curfew laws. It's simplyimpossible,'' said John Roberts, director of the Massachusetts CLU.``It will be enforced in some neighborhoods and you know whichones. It will be enforced vigorously in Roxbury in a way that itwill not in West Roxbury.''   Roxbury is a predominantly black neighborhood that has beenbeset by violent crime in the past several years. West Roxbury is apredominantly white neighborhood and one of the more affluentsections of Boston.   Harbour's nude body was found on a grassy knoll in the FranklinField park in Dorchester, a neighborhood next to Roxbury that alsohas been troubled by crime. Harbour had been bludgeoned, repeatedlyraped, and stabbed more than 100 times.   Boston city Councilor Bruce Bolling, who is black, said thecurfew idea ``merits some discussion,'' but he questioned how itcould be practically enforced.   State Sen. Bill Owens criticized police for withholding detailsof the murder and investigation for three weeks. He added that ``Wedo not accept the blanket indictment that the entire black malepopulation of our community behaves in this manner.''   Police compared the attack to one in New York's Central Park inwhich a female jogger was raped, brutally beaten and left for dead,allegedly by a group of black teen-agers who had gone ``wilding.''   The Harbour slaying initially drew little public notice afterpolice announced it as a homicide. Details weren't released untilthis week after the arrests of the eight teen-agers, five of themjuveniles.   Prosecutors are seeking to have the five juveniles charged asadults. Conviction as an adult on a charge of first-degree murderwould bring an automatic life sentence without parole. If they arefound delinquent as juveniles, they could be released on their 18thbirthday.   The juveniles are scheduled to appear in court Dec. 5. Threeadults aged 17, 18 and 19 have a pre-trial hearing on Dec. 29.</TEXT></DOC>
