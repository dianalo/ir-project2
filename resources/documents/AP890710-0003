If</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union could accept Bushadministration proposals for trial inspections of nuclear weaponssystems, as long as more weapons are covered, and would considerlimits on multi-warhead mobile missiles, the chief Soviet armscontrol spokesman is quoted as saying.   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov, in a Moscow interviewreported in Tuesday editions of The Washington Post, said suchinspections ``should not prevent the normal development ofnegotiations in Geneva or be a precondition for work on the drafttext and protocols. They should go hand in hand.''   But Karpov said the Soviets want to include more weapons systemsthan were envisioned in the U.S. proposal put forward in the START _Strategic Arms Reduction Talks _ negotiations in Geneva last monthfor monitoring experiments while the talks are under way.   U.S. officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experimentsto silo-based missiles and mobile strategic missiles. Karpov,however, was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber basesshould be included.   The first monitoring should be of sea-launched cruise missiles,``one of the areas where the most difficult verification problemsarise,'' he said. He suggested inspectors might visit each other'scruise missile factories.   Though the United States proposed continuous monitoring ofentrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles,it has no such plants of its own.   However, the Bush administration has proposed to put the10-warhead MX missile on rail cars and the proposed single-warheadMidgetman on mobile land transporters.   Karpov said, ``If we can have inspectors at production plants forthe MX or the Midgetman, then we would be ready to have such a teamat our plant'' producing the multi-warhead SS-24, a mobile missile.   Asked if the Soviets would consider banning or sharply limitingsuch missiles, Karpov said, ``I think that can be considered.''   He said the Soviet Union might also accept a ban on nuclearcruise missiles of any range, instead of numerical limits on thelong-range strategic variety it has put forward, ``If we can findefficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclearweapons in a way that won't harm U.S. and Soviet securityinterests.''</TEXT></DOC>
