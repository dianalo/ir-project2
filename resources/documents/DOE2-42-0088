<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0088 </DOCNO><TEXT>Analysis has been made of seven different cases of breaks in pipes connectedto the hot leg and to the loop seal in Ringhals 2 PWR. The pipes, inwhich guillotine breaks are postulated, have nominal diameters rangingfrom 1 to 14 inches. The purpose of the analysis is to supplement thebasis for a review of the inspection procedures for the safety of pressurevessels prescribed by SKI. A similar analysis already exists concerningbreaks in the cold leg connections. The analysis has been made usingthe thermal hydraulic computer code RELAPS/MOD2 and with best estimateassumptions. This means that normal operating conditions have been adoptedfor the input to the calculations. However, the capacity of the safetyinjection system was assumed to be reduced by having one pump not operatingeach of the low pressure and high pressure safety injection system. Theresults of the analysis are presented in tables and as computer plots.The analysis shows that the consequences with respect to increased fuelrod and cladding temperatures are quite harmless. Only the two caseswith the largest break sizes lead to critical heat flux (CHF) and increasedtemperatures for the hottest rods in the core. The peak cladding temperaturewas 636 degrees C for the 12 inch break. In both cases rewetting occurredwithin 25 s of accident initiation. In the cases with breaks in connectionsof 6 inch diameter and smaller the RELAP5 calculations indicated a substantialmargin to CHF throughout the transient. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
