SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a public voteof confidence Tuesday for James A. Baker III, saying the newsecretary of state is open to new ideas and ``not dogmatic'' indiscussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against thewhite-ruled government of South Africa.   ``I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have beenimpressed,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who flew toWashington for the early-evening meeting between Baker and adelegation sponsored by the World Council of Churches.   Tutu said Baker made no promises, but indicated the newadministration is reviewing its policy toward South Africa.   Asked to compare his first meeting with Baker and past sessionswith former Secretary of State George Shultz, Tutu said:   ``I was very impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic, heactually was discussing with the group and was interested in anyinitiative that the United States might actively take to pressurethe South African government to the negotiating table.''   ``They are ... involved in a review process. He did not dismissus, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' Tutu saidafter the half-hour session at the State Department.   Tutu joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour ofthe United States, several West European capitals and Japan toconvince government officials to take a stronger stand against SouthAfrica and its policy of apartheid.   The archbishop said the delegation asked Baker to consider theimposition of more economic sanctions against South Africa as ameans of pressuring the white-rule government to abolish apartheid.   Tutu stressed, however, the real appeal to Baker was made as anappeal against racial injustice.   ``More than anything else, the call of the delegation (was) thatthe United States had to take a moral leadership in what is a moralissue facing the world,'' Tutu said.   In 1986, Congress imposed sanctions against South Africa despitea veto by then-President Reagan, putting in place a ban on new loansand investments, a prohibition of the importation of South Africancoal and other materials, and halting direct U.S.-South African airlinks.   The group of church leaders, formally known as the Eminent ChurchPersons Group of the World Council of Churches, is composed ofMetropolitan Paulos Mr Gregorios, India; Rev. Canaan Banana,Zimbabwe; Elaine Hesse Greif, New Zealand, World YWCA generalsecretary; Lysaneas Maciel, Brazil, Brazil National Assembly federaldeputy and Ministry of Labor legal counselor; Lucille Mair,Trinidad, University of the West Indies; Rev. Carl Mau, Washington,D.C., former Lutheran World Federation general secretary.</TEXT></DOC>
