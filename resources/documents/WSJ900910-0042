The closed-door talks continued into the evening yesterdayin a converted bar in the officers' club at Andrews Air ForceBase near here. Budget negotiators, who are hoping to reachagreement by tomorrow, are scheduled to meet with PresidentBush for two hours this morning. Bush administration andcongressional aides said progress toward a deficit-reductioncompromise has been excruciatingly slow.</LP><TEXT>   In opening rounds, the two sides clearly staked outcontrasting positions. Democrats, determined to hit thewealthy hard, called for increasing the top nominalincome-tax rate to 35% from the current 28%, and for anadditional 10% surcharge on taxpayers earning more than$500,000 a year.   Republicans continued to resist any increases inincome-tax rates and proposed cutting to 15% thecapital-gains tax rate, now a maximum of 33%. In January,President Bush proposed cutting the rate to 19.6% over threeyears.   In a spirited debate yesterday, participants said HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued stronglythat any cut in capital-gains taxes would have to be pairedwith higher income-tax rates. White House Budget DirectorRichard Darman, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.) and Sen. PhilGramm (R., Texas) insisted no income-tax rate increases wouldbe acceptable to Republicans.   &quot;This is like a basketball game,&quot; White House Chief ofStaff John Sununu said yesterday on ABC News's &quot;This Weekwith David Brinkley.&quot; &quot;It almost all happens in the last twominutes. Oct. 1 is when the clock goes off.&quot; Under theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, deep across-the-boardspending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1 unless there is adeficit-reduction accord.   Although the two sides were inching closer on some issues,the two sides remained billions of dollars apart on howdeeply to cut the defense budget and continued to disagree ondomestic spending. Democrats infuriated some Republicans withan initial proposal to increase spending on various domesticprograms, including education and parks, by more than $70billion over the next five years, aides said.   In one hopeful sign, however, congressional aides saidnegotiators yesterday were approaching a consensus to pareprojected spending on federal benefit programs, such asMedicare and government employee pensions, by between $10billion and $11 billion.   What's more, both sides now favor expanded tax breaks forchild-care expenses, with the Republicans proposing a moremodest plan. Both sides proposed higher taxes on alcoholicbeverages. And both sides are shunning any increase intobacco taxes, apparently figuring the political fight withtobacco-state legislators isn't worth the revenue.   Both Republicans and Democrats would substantiallyincrease taxes on life insurance companies and extend the 3%tax on long-distance telephone calls.   In addition to raising the income-tax rate and imposingthe new surcharge, Democrats also proposed raising thealternative minimum tax for individuals -- paid byupper-income individuals who would otherwise avoid taxesunder the regular tax system -- to 26% from the current 21%.These three proposals alone would raise $9.2 billion infiscal 1991 and $97.8 billion over five years, a summaryprepared by Democrats shows. The Democratic proposal alsowould extend the 1.45% payroll tax for Medicare to coverwages above the current earnings limit of $50,400.   Congressional aides said the Democrats also suggestedincreasing the top corporate income tax rate to 35% from thecurrent 34%, although that wasn't included in the Democrats'initial written proposal.   The Democratic energy tax proposals include a seven-centincrease in the nine-cent-a gallon federal gasoline tax andan oil-import fee that would be triggered only when the priceof oil falls below $20 a barrel, with all the oil-importrevenue devoted to assistance to low-income Americans. Thepackage also includes a new tax on all energy sources thatwould begin at 2% but double to 4% in the second year.   GOP staffers said the Republicans also are contemplatingenergy taxes, although they apparently haven't been formallyput on the table. The popularity of energy taxes is somethingof a surprise because the Persian Gulf crisis already haspushed up oil prices sharply, but the negotiators apparentlydecided that the public believes the crisis offers strong,new reasons to encourage conservation. Both sides areproposing tax incentives for oil and gas drillers.   As expected, the Republicans proposed to limit taxpayers'deductions for income tax payments to state and localgovernments to $10,000 a year. This is their majoralternative to the rate increases suggested by the Democrats.   Among revenue-losing provisions, Republicans would extenda variety of soon-to-expire tax breaks, including those thatsubsidize corporate research and help the self-employedpurchase health insurance. They also would expand tax breaksfor individual retirement accounts. The Democrats have asimilar plan for IRAs.   For the benefit of poor people, Democrats would sweetenthe refundable earned income tax credit and slightly raisethe standard deduction taken by taxpayers who don't itemize.   Democrats suggested a new tax on luxury goods of 10% ofthe purchase price in excess of $25,000 for autos, $1,000 forelectronics, $5,000 for jewelry and $500 for furs.Republicans were said by aides to be contemplating a 5% levyon luxury goods.   On alcoholic beverages, the Democrats would raise $9.1billion over five years by doubling the federal tax on beerand wine. The tax is currently at 16 cents on a sixpack ofbeer and three cents a bottle on wine. For reasons thatweren't immediately clear, the Democrats' initial proposalexcluded sparkling wine. They also proposed increasing thetax on distilled spirits to $14.50 per &quot;proof gallon&quot; ofalcohol from the current $12.50 a gallon.   The Republicans opening bid would raise $22.8 billion overfive years by raising taxes on beer and wine, but not hardliquor.   Both Republicans and Democrats have presented plans thatthey say would cut the deficit by about $50 billion in fiscal1991, which begins Oct. 1, and by $500 billion over the nextfive years. But both sides rely on deficit-reduction measuresthat the other side says are ephemeral. The Democrats, forinstance, figure on raising $1.5 billion in the first yearand $9.2 billion over five years from intensified governmentdebt-collection efforts.   Even if negotiators agree to cut the projected fiscal 1991deficit by $50 billion, they would be nearly $100 billionaway from the $64 billion deficit target in the Gramm-Rudmanlaw, according to White House budget office estimates. Aidesalso concede that to reach a compromise, negotiators may beforced to trim the first-year package to substantially lessthan $50 billion. In any event, all sides have agreed thatany deficit accord would have to include a change in theGramm-Rudman deficit target.   ---   David Wessel contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
