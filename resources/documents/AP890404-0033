President Ferdinand Marcos fled to Hawaii when he was ousted bya military-civilian uprising in February 1986 that swept CorazonAquino to power.   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized in Honolulu since Jan. 15 fortreatment of heart and lung ailments. Hospital officials say heremains in guarded condition.   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected appeals by Marcos' relativesto allow the former president to return. In February, CabinetSecretary Jose de Jesus said that for security reasons thepresident and the Cabinet had agreed not to allow even Marcos' bodyto be brought home if he dies.   ``I'll keep Marcos here until 1992. Then I'll bring him home,''Mrs. Marcos was reported as saying in the interview. That is theyear when President Aquino's six-year term ends and a newpresidential election is held.   Marcos mother's body was embalmed and put on display after shedied last May at age 95. Relatives say they are waiting for theformer president to return to bury her.   The body of Josefa Edralin-Marcos now lies in state at Marcos'provincial home in Batac, 240 miles north of Manila. A morticianvisits every two months to inject embalming fluid and retouch hermade-up face.   In the interview, Mrs. Marcos also said she was optimistic thatMrs. Aquino's successor would allow them to return and fulfill awish of her husband to be cremated and have his ashes scattered``to fertilize his country.''   Mrs. Marcos, who is more than 20 years younger than her husbandand was once groomed to succeed him, said she had no intention ofrunning in 1992.   ``I've seen it all. I've had it all. Now, all I want is to beleft alone,'' she said.   The Marcoses have been indicted on racketeering charges by a NewYork grand jury. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent at her arraignmentlast October, but her husband's arraignment has been postponedbecause of his health.   They are accused of stealing more than $100 million from thePhilippine government and using the money to buy prime New Yorkproperty. The Aquino government says the Marcoses and theirassociates robbed the country of at least $10 billion in cash andother assets during the 20-year rule by Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
