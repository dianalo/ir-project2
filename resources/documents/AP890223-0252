Greenspan, in testimony submitted to the Senate BankingCommittee, also said the Fed has made arrangements to support theFederal Home Loan Bank system in the event of runs on Sandamp;Ls.   The committee was holding its second day of hearings on PresidentBush's plan to rescue the ailing industry by selling $50 billion inbonds to raise the money to close insolvent institutions.   Some analysts have said the president's plan won't provide enoughmoney, but Greenspan said that ``in our judgment, all thingsconsidered, the $50 billion should be adequate'' to take care of 470insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   Investment from outside the thrift industry, from banks and otherfirms, likely will be needed in order for the thrift industry tomeet the new capital standards that the administration is proposing,analysts have said. Greenspan said ``more than a majority ofthrifts'' that are not insolvent will be able to meet the newcapital requirements.   The central bank chairman also said he ``attaches considerableimportance'' to a proposed Treasury Department study of the depositinsurance system. He said the study should help ``ensure a smoothtransition to modified insurance arrangements.''   Part of the study should include whether it is ``unnecessary toprovide special government subsidized facilities for mortgagelending,'' Greenspan said. In the future, it may be ``possible tobring all the depository institutions under one regulatory andsupervisory system,'' he suggested.   He told the committee ``it is vitally important for Congress tomove very promptly to consider and enact the president's proposals.''   Congressional leaders say an attempt by Bush to keep the rescueplan from inflating the short-term federal deficit will add billionsof dollars to the eventual cost.   Bush wants to pay for part of the rescue by selling $50 billionin ``off-budget'' bonds over the next three years through a specialgovernment-sponsored corporation. That way, the government couldspend $50 billion that would not show up on the books as part of thebudget deficit.   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,said Wednesday that figures compiled by his staff show theoff-budget mechanism will cost the government an additional $4.6billion over 30 years.   Meanwhile, James Blum, acting director of the CongressionalBudget Office, told the House Ways and Means Committee that theadministration's plan would boost the government's interest paymentsby $100 million to $200 million a year.   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady vigorously defended thearrangement Wednesday before Riegle's committee, which conducted thefirst congressional hearing on the 2{-week-old plan.   Brady acknowledged that the bailout could be financed on-budgetthrough regular, long-term Treasury borrowing but said that would beat a cost of ``one less Trident submarine or no day care.''   Brady also was sharply questioned about whether theadministration is proposing a big enough rescue to put the industryon a sound footing. He said that not only would the plan providemoney to close 350 insolvent institutions and meet the commitmentson 205 failed Sandamp;Ls rescued last year, it would provide $24 billionfrom 1992 through 1999 to handle the possible failures of another150 weak institutions.   Riegle told reporters after Wednesday's hearing that he waskeeping an open mind, but so far could find no reason to favor anoff-budget arrangement.   ``If there are advantages, they're not obvious to me. ... I thinkyou start from the premise that you ought to keep the cost to aminimum, especially when you and your folks and your neighbors aregoing to have to pay for this problem, or a large part of it,'' hesaid.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, said in a 13-page analysis of the Bush plan thattaxpayers would save $138 billion over 30 years if Congress directlyappropriated the Sandamp;L money.   But, he conceded, that ``would require a special tax earmarkedsolely for the purpose of financing the savings and loan bailout''and ``administration policy and political reality may rule out thismore direct approach.''   Riegle and the ranking Republican on his panel, Sen. Jake Garn,R-Utah, said they were introducing the 333-page administrationproposal on Wednesday. Riegle said he hoped to have a bill ready foraction by the full Senate by the first week in April.   Gonzalez, despite his reservations about parts of theadministration plan, intends to introduce it in the House.   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman askedthe House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday to extend tax breaksoffered to private buyers of failed Sandamp;Ls and banks. They're set toexpire at the end of the year.   Seidman said the tax breaks reduce the on-budget cost of rescuesand promised to use them ``to minimize the government's total cost.''   However, Charles A. Bowsher, head of the General AccountingOffice, said more direct assistance to failed institutions ischeaper. Blum also warned that the current system is attracting somebuyers who are most interested in obtaining the tax breaks than inoperating the rescued Sandamp;Ls efficiently.</TEXT></DOC>
