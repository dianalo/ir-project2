The transaction, if completed, would be among the two or three largest investments ever by the Japanese in a U.S. financial institution. It rivals Fuji Bank Ltd.'s equity investment in Heller International Corp., a Chicago-based commercial finance concern Fuji bought for $425 million. Fuji's investment now totals $1.15 billion, including an unspecified capital loan.    The acquisition more than doubles the size of California First Bank, the 77%-owned Bank of Tokyo unit that is purchasing Union Bank. It also affords Bank of Tokyo a major stake in California's robust economy.    Meanwhile, the sale will give some breathing room to Standard Chartered, which acquired Union in 1979 for $377 million but has been under pressure lately to raise capital. And it portends further turmoil for the 4,200 employees of Union Bank, which is being sold for the second time in less than a decade.    The transaction will take up to nine months to complete and result in an institution with $15 billion in assets, the fifth-largest bank in California. The acquisition marks a significant strategic expansion for California First, primarily a consumer lender with some Japanese business customers. Union Bank, by comparison, has concentrated on business lending since a German merchant started it 74 years ago.    The dissimilar approaches indicate that large layoffs or office closings are unlikely, analysts said. A California First spokesman said staff reductions would be needed, but that the precise number wouldn't be known for a year or more. He said there was &quot;no appreciable overlap&quot; in the banks' 167 total offices. &quot;Their market has been significantly different than ours,&quot; he said.    The sale shows the changing fortunes of Japanese and British bankers. The sale will mean that five of California's 10 largest banks will be owned by Japanese concerns, which now have about double the share of U.S. banking assets they held in 1980. British banks, meanwhile, have been beating a hasty retreat. Aside from Standard's planned departure, Barclays Bank PLC sold its California retail bank last month, while Lloyds Bank PLC and Midland Bank PLC pulled out in 1986.    &quot;Bank of Tokyo has put a clear stake in the ground in terms of its commitment to the banking market in California and perhaps more broadly the U.S.,&quot; said James Bemowski, a principal with McKinsey andamp; Co., in Los Angeles.    Publicly reported Japanese acquisitions in the U.S. more than doubled last year, to a record $5.9 billion, spurred by the strong yen, a growing familiarity with mergers, and the allure of the American market. The Japanese yen is also playing an increased role in international banking transactions. Japanese banks eclipsed U.S. banks internationally two years ago, and have been extending the lead ever since. According to the Bank for International Settlements, for instance, Japanese banks increased their lending abroad 70% to $231 billion in the year ended Sept. 30.    The new invasion is prompting some controversy, however. A California assemblyman plans to introduce legislation that would force open the bidding for state banks that are targeted by foreign-owned suitors. Currently, money-center banks are unable to bid until 1991 under state banking law. Last year, Citicorp and other New York banks wanting to expand in California fought legislation that cleared the way for foreign bidders.    The $750 million purchase price, about 25% more than Union Bank's shareholder equity at Dec. 31, reflects a modest premium. When Standard indicated last summer it might consider selling Union Bank, some analysts expected a price of as much as $1.7 billion. The lower price underscores the cooling of the bank merger market because of the stock market crash, the growing skittishness about financial deregulation, and more stringent government capital requirements.    &quot;People say because of the appreciation of the Japanese yen that everything looks cheap to us,&quot; said Seishichi Itoh, the president and chief executive of San Francisco-based California First. &quot;But as businessmen, we worry about the return on investment being cheap, too.&quot;    In London, Standard defended the price and said the transaction &quot;closes the sales season.&quot; In Los Angeles, John Harrigan, Union Bank's chairman, called the proposed acquisition &quot;a very happy resolution to the months of uncertainty. . . .&quot;    Mr. Itoh said $250 million of the price will be financed through subordinated capital notes and the balance through the sale of common stock to U.S. investors as well as to the parent. Some analysts had questioned Bank of Tokyo's ability to finance such a large investment. The bank is considered one of the weaker of the Japanese banking giants, with a relatively large amount of Third World loans outstanding.    Mr. Itoh said Union and California First will operate as separate divisions for a while, but indicated that a new name is coming. He declined to give his preference, but California First has tried hard to portray an American image. Less than 1% of its employees are Japanese, for instance. &quot;This bank is an American bank,&quot; Mr. Itoh said. &quot;We are older than Bank of America.&quot;    Responding to the merger agreement, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. placed the debt of Bank of Tokyo and the certificates of deposit of California First on CreditWatch with negative implications. Securities of Union Bancorp -- Union Bank is its principal operating subsidiary -- were listed with positive implications. Union Bank's profitability, measured by return on assets, declined in 1987. Standard andamp; Poor's said Union Bank's &quot;worsening asset quality problems, narrowing margins and high overhead expenses&quot; could affect the results of the combined banks.    ---                        The Two Banks                             UNION BANK     CALIFORNIA                                            FIRST BANK    Assets                   $9.1 billion   $6.1 million    Equity                   $590 million   $350 million    Net income               $56 million    $40 million    Employees                4,200          3,900    Offices                  32             135    Note: All numbers are as of December 31, except for the number of Union Bank employees, which is current</TEXT></DOC>
