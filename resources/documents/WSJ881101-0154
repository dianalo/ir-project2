After only modest wins in the 100th Congress, following years of Reagan-caused drought, labor will revive many bills, with a few new ones. &quot;Our plate is still full,&quot; says Robert McGlotten, an AFL-CIO official. Recent stretch runners -- minimum wage, parental leave and child care -- will get an early push. Bills to notify workers exposed to toxic-chemical disease risk and for mandated health-care benefits for employees rank high.    A new bill to toughen OSHA's workplace health and safety rules is a &quot;biggie,&quot; a union man says. But changing labor law to curb management union busting, also a favorite, may be scuttled if Congress seems hostile; Mr. McGlotten rules out any &quot;Kamikaze mission.&quot;    Noting Bush's pledges on certain labor issues, a Senate staffer says, &quot;I assume that unlike Reagan, he'll be for something.&quot;    ILL EQUIPPED? Firms struggle to handle climbing health-care costs.    Most companies say they're having trouble controlling employee health benefits, rising nearly 20% a year, a survey reported by Personnel Journal shows. Fully 71% of 100 health-benefit executives polled by Corporate Health Strategies, Connecticut consultant, said their firms lack formal long-term plans for curbing health care expenses; 68% don't have information systems to monitor claims and health-use data.    About 44% of the firms use &quot;a quick fix&quot; for soaring costs, the survey said. The biggest obstacle to controlling future costs, cited by 79% of the executives, was doctor charges. Surveyed firms rate their own cost-control success an average of 5.6, on a scale of one to 10.    ROBUST BUSINESS spurs more hiring plans by some firms.    Southwest and America West Airlines will hire more pilots and flight attendants next year, as they add flights. Chi-Chi's, expanding by 14 new restaurants, will need 100 more managers and 1,500 workers. Because of soaring sales, Invacare Corp., an Elyria, Ohio-based home health-care equipment maker, plans to hire 100 people &quot;across the board&quot; during 1989.    Marketing managers are the rage, and many manufacturers are adding senior executives at a near-record pace, says Korn/Ferry International, a search firm. But Rohr Industries, Chevron and Ashland Coal foresee only steady work-force levels, while Enron Corp., a gas-pipeline firm, and Smith International, an oil-drilling tool maker, will trim a combined 450 workers.    Chevron doesn't rule out &quot;realignments&quot; when a new chairman takes over Jan. 1.    ROSY CAMPUS VIEW: Fully 46% of college students in a Roper Organization poll see owning a business as an &quot;excellent&quot; chance to get ahead, compared with 22% of adults in another Roper survey. Top prospects were seen by 35% in working for large firms and 20% at small ones, vs. 14% each by adults.    BAN THE GRAPE: Some city governments support the United Farm Workers' boycott, over pesticide use on the vines. New York and Boston stop serving grapes in city institutions and agencies, joining some California actions. About 30 cities have passed boycott-backing resolutions.    SALARIES AND BONUSES climbed an average of 16% in 1988 for 210 chief executives surveyed by Hay Group, consultants; they rose 11% in 1987. But a fifth took cuts as company performance lagged. More top-level pay, responding to public criticism, will be tied to the company's financial performance, Hay says.    IMPORTS AWAY: The Navy brought in some Japanese and Filipino workers at its Long Beach, Calif., and Philadelphia shipyards, saying it couldn't get U.S. laborers at the yards' pay scale. But after union and congressional protests, the short-time imported help was sent back home early.    AFFIRMATIVE ACTION gains favor as a way to meet worker shortages.    Employers see that eager recruiting among groups like women, minorities and the disabled will help, instead of &quot;fighting&quot; the idea, says Fred Alvarez, a Labor Department official. &quot;Economic necessity&quot; means that such groups &quot;will be swept up,&quot; says Shawmut National, a bank holding company. Merck sends scientists to schools to be role models for recruiting women and minorities.    Firms in the 200-member Equal Employment Advisory Council tell others how to use affirmative action to meet a shrinking labor supply. A San Diego jobs center formed by semiconductor makers trains the disadvantaged. Public Service Electric andamp; Gas in New Jersey aids Goodwill Industries computer training for severely disabled persons. Wall Street executives form a jobs program for Vietnam veterans.    &quot;We all have a responsibility to broaden the work force,&quot; by reforming education, says Norman Greenman, president of Rogers Corp.    THE CHECKOFF: Some 26% of U.S. adult workers are college graduates, up from 21% in 1978, the Labor Department says. . . . High-level protest: Four workers at a Gillette plant in Annecy, France, climbed the nearby Alps to unfurl a banner opposing the plant's closing. . . . Lifetime Corp. offers a stock purchase plan for its temporary as well as permanent health-care workers. </TEXT></DOC>
