We've been looking forward to a great constitutional debate, now that the Democrats opposing Ronald Reagan's judicial nominees have dropped pretenses about spelling errors and deed restrictions and flatly proclaimed that judicial philosophy's the thing. Just what philosophy, we've wondered, do Robert Bork's critics have to offer?    Ted Kennedy is abundantly clear: The purpose of jurisprudence is to protect one sacred cow for each of the Democratic Party's constituent interest groups. The law is what judges say it is, and the test of nominees is whether they will use this power to advance purposes Senator Kennedy favors. In particular, judges must advance these purposes irrespective of the democratic outcome in the legislative branch in which the senator sits.    So far as we remember, in fact, Judge Bork has no position on public policy toward, say, abortion. What he does believe is that judges should read the Constitution, and second-guess legislatures only on the basis of what it says. If the Constitution says nothing about abortion, legislatures can allow it or ban it. Someone who doesn't agree with their choice has every right to campaign for new legislators. If the Constitution doesn't speak, redress lies in the political process.    Judge Bork would never discover in the Constitution a &quot;right&quot; to Star Wars or aid for the Contras. His philosophy of judicial restraint is grounded in the fundamental constitutional principle of separation of powers. Congress makes the laws, the president executes the laws and the courts' only role is to ensure that the laws are consistent with the Constitution. Where the Bill of Rights is clear, such as outlawing racial discrimination, judges must make sure these rights are protected. But the courts are not supposed to invalidate laws simply because judges don't like them, or find new rights that do not appear in the Constitution.    Judge Bork made an elegant statement of this view in a case his enemies are sure to raise as proof of his reactionary ideas. Dronenburg v. Chief of Naval Personnel asked whether the courts should overturn the Navy's policy of mandatory discharge for sailors who engage in homosexual acts. Though receiving an honorable discharge, the plaintiff claimed a right to &quot;privacy&quot; that would override the Navy rule. Writing for a unanimous D.C. Circuit panel in 1984, Judge Bork said it would be wrong for judges to replace the judgment of the military by finding a right not mentioned in the Constitution.    &quot;If it is in any degree doubtful that the Supreme Court should freely create new constitutional rights, we think it certain that lower courts should not do so,&quot; Judge Bork wrote. &quot;If the revolution in sexual mores that appellant proclaims is in fact ever to arrive, we think it must arrive through the moral choice of the people, and their elected representatives, not through the judicial ukase of this court.&quot;    Ukase was a well-chosen word. It is derived from the Russian, and defined by Webster's as &quot;in Czarist Russia, an imperial order or decree, having the force of law.&quot; Under our system of government, laws made by judges have a similar illegitimacy. The executive branch can change its rule against homosexuality in the military or Congress could pass a law to do so. This might or might not be a good idea, but Judge Bork was on firm democratic ground when he said it was not for judges to decide. The Founders called the courts the &quot;least dangerous branch&quot; because judges were supposed to play a negative role, upsetting legislation only that violates the text of the Constitution.    The distinction is not especially subtle or complex, yet is frequently missed by people who consider themselves intelligent and sophisticated. Conditioned by decades of judicial activism on behalf of liberal causes, they think of court cases in stark terms of who wins, not in terms of what the Constitution says. At stake in this standoff of competing judicial theories is whether the Constitution in its bicentennial year means anything at all.    Senator Kennedy has heard these arguments before. Ronald Reagan campaigned to two landslides on the promise to appoint supremely qualified judges who accept the limited role they were granted under our constitutional system. The Democratic Senate can of course reject Mr. Bork precisely because he is the kind of nominee the president promised; redress for that would lie in the next national election. </TEXT></DOC>
