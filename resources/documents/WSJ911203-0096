In the race to invent a television for the 21st century,the contestants are nearing the finish line.</LP><TEXT>   This week, researchers from General Instrument Corp. areshowing off their high-definition, or clear-picture,television system at a test laboratory across the PotomacRiver from Washington, D.C.   They will be followed in February by a team from ZenithElectronics Corp. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.Around April comes a group consisting of SRI International'sDavid Sarnoff Research Center, the NBC unit of GeneralElectric Co. and U.S. units of Thomson S.A. of France andPhilips Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands.   Yet another entry from General Instrument and theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, which became partnersearlier this year, is to be tested after that.   &quot;We're coming down to the end game,&quot; says James McKinney,a former Federal Communications Commission official who leadsa TV standards-setting organization in Washington. The FCC isexpected to make a final decision in 1993.   The stakes are enormous. If at least one of the systemsworks, the U.S. would take the global lead in applying thedigital language of computers to television broadcasting.With digital TV systems, complex picture information iscompressed, then broadcast and received via a stream ofpulses, or commands in 1s and 0s.   Japan, which has pushed high-definition technology foryears, recently expanded HDTV broadcasts to eight hours a dayfrom one. But it uses the older analog method -- in whichpictures are signaled by variations in radio waves -- leavingit to play catch-up in digital transmission. Europe, whichhas poured huge sums of money into research, has been boggeddown in disagreements over how to get started.   Proponents claim high-definition TV will turn Americanliving rooms into mini-movie theaters or sports arenas withcompact disk-quality sound and razor-sharp pictures on widescreens. Ultimately, an HDTV set could act like a computer,altering and sending video images.   Overnight success isn't likely. When the sets firstarrive, possibly by 1995, they could cost $3,500 or more. Andit could be well into the next century before their salesoutpace those of conventional sets, of which about 20 millionare sold annually. Still, steady high-definition growth coulddrive down costs for TV makers and others, spurring wider useof high-definition systems by industry and the military.   Oddsmakers following the U.S. competition figureZenith-ATandamp;T is the team to beat. General Instrument, thefirst to propose digital in June 1990, is seen as a strongsecond with the system that begins testing this week. A wildcard is that those companies or the Sarnoff group coulddecide to join together before the FCC makes its decision. Acombination could lead not only to shared technology but alsoto political and economic clout. Already, mergers anddropouts have whittled the number of competing systems to sixfrom 23.   Two systems already tested aren't given much chance ofsuccess, unless digital HDTV flops. NHK, or the JapanBroadcasting Corp., uses the old-fashioned analogtransmission. An intermediate system of &quot;enhanced definition&quot;pictures from the Sarnoff group is a laggard because the FCCprefers to take the bigger step to high-definition.   Engineers and others who have examined the detaileddescriptions from Zenith-ATandamp;T and General Instrument sayZenith-ATandamp;T chose to employ more bells and whistles. (Becausethey test later, the other entrants haven't had to fullydescribe their systems yet.)   For example, Zenith and ATandamp;T say they invented a specialdigital filter to screen out interference from analog TVsignals. The FCC has said that all the systems must becompatible with current TV transmission so that existing setsaren't made obsolete by the new technology.   Zenith and ATandamp;T also boast that they can prevent theabrupt loss of HDTV reception in fringe areas by transmittingspecial signals that continue with important pictureinformation when other signals are interrupted.   &quot;My feeling is the Zenith system is conceptually two tothree years newer than the General Instrument system,&quot; saysJack Fuhrer, a former Sarnoff researcher who directs HitachiLtd.'s U.S. research lab for high-definition TV. He notesthat the risk in that approach is that the system may notwork right in time for testing.   Zenith and ATandamp;T say they'll be ready. The Glenview, Ill.,TV maker has already benefited from the telephone company'sexpertise in digital and semiconductor technology -- and fromits research money. Zenith hasn't had a full-year profit fromcontinuing operations since 1984. It's hoping for a lift fromboth high-definition systems and its even bigger investmentin flat picture tubes for high-definition displays.   General Instrument, a cable-TV equipment company owned bythe New York buy-out firm of Forstmann, Little andamp; Co., linkedits high-definition effort with MIT last January. Thepartnership came too late for the university to contributemuch to General Instrument's entry. But General Instrument'sengineers will build MIT's system for the spring.   While some see General Instrument's system as too basic,Robert Rast, one of the company's top researchers, prefers todescribe the system as &quot;elegant in its simplicity.&quot; He alsosays it works. Others are still building or tinkering withtheirs.   At the HDTV testing center -- the Advanced Television TestCenter in Alexandria, Va. -- technicians over the nextseveral months will try to determine what its executivedirector, Peter Fannon, calls &quot;the breaking point&quot; of thesystems. They will measure factors such as the extent towhich the high-definition signal interferes with current TVchannels, and vice versa.   The committee overseeing the competition is expected torecommend a preferred system late next year, so the FCC canmake its decision the following year. The committee itself isa mishmash of colliding interests, including chief executivesfrom TV makers, broadcasters, cable TV companies andsuppliers. Their underlings attend to details in a maze ofgroups reporting to the committee.   The committee's decision would be easier if some systemsdidn't work or did poorly on a number of tests. But fewexpect that. It's more likely that the committee will have tocarefully weigh factors such as the quality of the sound andpicture, the distance the signal carries and the cost toconsumers and broadcasters.   &quot;It will be very difficult to decide,&quot; says John Abel,executive vice president of the National Association ofBroadcasters and a member of the test center's board.</TEXT></DOC>
