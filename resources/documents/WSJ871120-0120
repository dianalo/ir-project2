The project would require a total investment of between $5 billion and $6 billion, Armand Hammer, chairman of the Los Angeles-based oil company, said in announcing the accord in Moscow. Most of that money is expected to come from the two Western companies, and oil industry sources questioned how quickly the companies might realize any return.    Under the agreement with the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Industry, the Soviet Union would provide the gas liquids and sulfur used in production in exchange for a 51% ownership of the venture.    Occidental's prepared statement didn't provide information about each company's investment or ownership of the venture, and it didn't say when the venture might be expected to operate and contribute to Occidental's earnings. Occidental officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Occidental shares closed at $24.50, down 62.5 cents.    The statement said the ultimate goal of the complex, which would use raw materials from the Tengiz oil field, would be to produce annually 500,000 tons of polypropylene, 500,000 tons of polyethelene, one million tons of commercial sulfur and other plastics. The goal would be to sell at least 50% of the products on the world market, the statement said. Dr. Hammer described the project as &quot;one of the largest petrochemical complexes in the world.&quot;    But analysts and others familiar with the oil industry cautioned against such optimistic projections in the face of the Soviet obstructionism and bureaucracy that have plagued other Soviet-Western ventures. &quot;The caution we've used in the past toward the Soviets shouldn't be thrown out just because we've got glasnost,&quot; one oil industry analyst said, referring to Soviet leader Gorbachev's new policy of &quot;openness.&quot;    Analysts said the huge investment required in the Occidental-Montedison project would pay off only if the Soviet Union gave the Western companies a discount on use of its natural gas and sulfur. &quot;If all Oxy is getting is access to Soviet (raw materials) but no favorable pricing, then it's potentially a questionable deal,&quot; said Michael Smolinski, an oil economist at Data Resources Inc.    In addition, he said construction of the plant could be delayed if the Soviets insist on &quot;a significant Soviet content,&quot; including design, material and labor in building the project. In Milan, Italy, Montedison said work on the plant is expected to begin in 1989 and to take a minimum of three to four years to complete.    The Occidental-Montedison pact follows a recent agreement by Stamford, Conn.-based Combustion Engineering Inc. for a joint venture with the Soviet Union to help improve productivity in the country's oil-refining and petrochemical industries. Under that previously reported accord, the venture will be 49%-owned by Combustion Engineering and 51%-owned by the Soviet ministry.    In Washington, a Commerce Department official said U.S. participation in such joint ventures is possible under current regulations, which allow the export of non-strategic oil-and-gas technology to the Soviet bloc. The department lifted a U.S. embargo on such goods last January.    Montedison said its role in the venture with Occidental would be to put together an international consortium to build the petrochemical plant. It said Marubeni Corp. of Japan has already agreed to join the consortium.    Montedison's Technimont construction unit has already built nearly 50 chemical plants in the Soviet Union since 1983, the company said. In addition, Montedison -- Italy's second-largest publicly traded industrial concern -- conducts barter trade with the Soviets, valued at 103 billion lire ($83 billion) last year and estimated at 140 billion lire in 1987.    &quot;It looks like good news for Montedison,&quot; one European financial analyst said of the venture with Occidental, noting that Montedison's heavy debt, estimated at about nine trillion lire, has been a concern to investors. But he noted that it is uncertain how good the news might be, as the companies involved haven't disclosed what percentage of the joint venture Montedison would own, or how much it could expect to earn. </TEXT></DOC>
