The Treasury's new benchmark 30-year bond, the 8.125%issue due in 2021, rose more than 1/2 point, a gain of morethan $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue'syield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,eased to 8.16%. Yesterday was the first time since the bondwas auctioned by the government last Thursday that it closedabove its average auction price.</LP><TEXT>   Bond prices declined early in the session after theCommerce Department reported that retail sales were up 0.5%in July. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital MarketsReport had expected a 0.2% increase. What's more, theCommerce Department revised upward the June and May data toshow increases of 0.1% and 1.2%, respectively, compared withoriginal estimates of a 0.2% decline in June and a 0.8%increase in May.   Bond prices typically decline on such news becauseinvestors fear that a strong economic rebound will reviveinflationary pressures. Inflation is the bane of the bondmarket.   But the temptation to lock in long-term yields as theyneared 8.25% proved to be powerful, and the market reverseddirection.   &quot;The retail sales number was a little sprightlier thanexpected, but people have a lot of reasons to buy bonds,&quot;said Michael J. Moore, trading department manager atContinental Bank, Chicago.   One of the biggest reasons is the unusually wide spreadbetween short-term and long-term yields. At 8.16%, the yieldon the long-term Treasury bond is 1.73 percentage pointshigher than the yield on two-year notes and 2.73 percentagepoints higher than the yield on three-month Treasury bills.   The yields available at the long end were apparently highenough to persuade some big institutional investors to buylarge amounts of 30-year bonds, traders said. Rumor had itthat the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, afrequently sighted player in the bond market, was the biginvestor, but chief investment officer Robert McLaughlin saidhis organization wasn't the big buyer during yesterday'ssession.   Looking ahead, market participants today will get thelatest report from the inflation front when the LaborDepartment releases the July consumer price index at 8:30a.m. EDT.   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Reportsaid they expect the index to have risen 0.3% in the month,or 0.4% when food and energy costs are excluded. In June, theCPI rose 0.2% overall and 0.4% excluding food and energy.   Also on tap for today is the Commerce Department's releaseof data on June business inventories and domestic automobilemanufacturers' reports on car sales in early August.   Another Capital Markets Report survey of economists foundthat they think business inventories fell 0.3% in June, aftera 0.5% drop in May. Car sales are expected to have declinedto a 6.4 million-unit annual rate in early August from a 6.7million rate in late July.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Prices ended moderately higher. The Treasury's newbenchmark 30-year bond ended when-issued trading at a priceof 99 15/32 to yield 8.16%, compared with 98 30/ 32 to yield8.21% Monday.   The other two securities sold last week in the three-part$38 billion quarterly refunding of the federal debt alsorose. The when-issued 10-year note ended at 99 23/32, up from99 13/32 Monday, to yield 7.90%. The when-issued three-yearnote ended at 100 3/32, up from 100 1/32, to yield 6.82%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 to 3/8 pointhigher, while highyield, high-risk junk bonds were generallylittle changed.   The financing subsidiary of a big British consumerproducts concern made its debut in the U.S. credit markets,selling $900 million of debt securities in a three-partoffering.   Grand Metropolitan Investment Corp., a unit of GrandMetropolitan PLC, issued $300 million each of five-yearnotes, 10-year notes and 20-year debentures.   The securities, which were sold through underwriters ledby Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., are guaranteed by Grand MetropolitanPLC.   The five-year notes were priced to yield 8.14%, the10-year notes were priced to yield 8.67%, and the 20-yeardebentures were offered at a yield of 9.09%.   Proceeds will be used to repay certain dollar-denominatedshort-term debt of Grand Metropolitan Investment.   According to the preliminary prospectus, the debt wasincurred to finance operations at the company's U.S. units.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Tax-exempt issuers sold more than $2 billion of notes andbonds yesterday, most of which met strong demand.   California's recent budget woes and the possible loss ofits triple-A ratings didn't damp investor interest in thestate's $1.2 billion general obligation issue.   Dealers said investors took heart from the state's recentactions to close a $14.3 billion budget gap in its currentfiscal year and its ability so far to avert any downgradefrom the major rating agencies.   California is one of only seven states to carry triple-Aratings from both Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody'sInvestors Service Inc., although Sandamp;P has the state on itsCreditWatch surveillance list with negative implications.   The California bonds were priced to yield from 4.50% in1992 to 6.60% in 2010 and 2011. Late yesterday, Bank ofAmerica, leader of the underwriting group that purchased thedeal in competitive bidding, reported an unsold balance of$225 million on the offering.   In addition to the top bond ratings, a noncallable featureattracted investors to the deal. The noncallable featuremeans the bonds, even the long-term issues, can't be redeemedprior to their stated maturity.   Although California is a frequent issuer of noncallablegeneral obligation bonds, &quot;you don't get too many noncallablebond issues&quot; in the municipal market, one dealer says. Inlight of moves by the Federal Reserve last week to lowerinterest rates, &quot;people are looking for non-call&quot; securitiesso they can lock in interest rates on their holdings, thedealer said.   Most long-term municipal bonds are callable in 10 years.   The top yield on the California bonds is 0.20 percentagepoint lower than the 6.80% top yield seen on $642 million ofdouble-Arated Washington state bonds sold Monday.   A Bank of America official said a mix of retail andinstitutional investors purchased the California bonds.   &quot;What the market is saying is that it still believesCalifornia is the benchmark of the marketplace, and it isstill perceived as a triple-A credit,&quot; said Mark Muller, anassistant vice president and portfolio manager at Van KampenMerritt Investment Advisory Corp. in Lisle, Ill.   Affluent California residents have a strong incentive forpurchasing California's general obligation bonds, because thestate recently increased its top income tax rate to 11% from9.3%.   In addition to standard general obligation bonds,underwriters offered investors a variety of choices on theCalifornia deal.   Approximately $60 million in bonds maturing in 2011 werestripped of their principal and interest payments andmarketed as zero-coupon bonds. In addition, underwriterspurchased some intermediate-range bonds and marketed them toinvestors as variable-rate securities, a Bank of Americaofficial said.   In other new issues, Maine sold $150 million of taxanticipation notes that were priced to yield 4.75%. The issuematures June 30, 1992.   In secondary market activity, prices of some New YorkLocal Goverment Assistance Corp. bonds rose 1/2 point intrading. Dealers attributed the sharp rise to short-coveringahead of the planned sale of about $400 million of bondstentatively set for Sept. 12. Late in the session, the 7%issue due 2016 was quoted at a bid of 98 1/4 to yield 7.14%.In a short sale, traders sell borrowed securities, hoping toreplace them at a lower price. Short-covering refers topurchases of securities to cover the later replacementobligations.   Today, Vermont will sell $80 million of general obligationnotes at 11 a.m. EDT in a competitive offering.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended higher.   In the secondary market, Government National MortgageAssociation 8.5% securities for September delivery were up9/32 at 99 7/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8.5%securities were up 7/32 at 98 28/32, and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities were up 7/32 at 9821/32.   In primary action, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s thirdmortgage-backed offering was the largest in a heavy $1.7billion slate of new deals announced yesterday.   The $473 million issue, the latest installment in thethrift bailout agency's plan to eventually securitize atleast $1 billion of mortgage assets from failed thrifts eachmonth, was the first RTC fixed-rate issue and the first to bebacked by some loans from banks outside California.   A spokesman for Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., the lead underwriterfor the offering, said &quot;there was enough interest toessentially place the bonds, but they were not overlysubscribed.&quot;   RTC's new securities are expected to be rated triple-A byMoody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.,based on an estimated 25% to 30% cash reserve fund that isdesigned to absorb any losses.   Yields were generally 1.05 to 1.65 percentage points morethan on similarly dated Treasurys. The fixed-rate deal, RTC1991-3, was backed by whole loans with original terms of 15years and 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
