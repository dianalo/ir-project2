Morris Levy, president of Roulette Records, his associate Howard Fisher, and Dominick Canterino, a reputed organized-crime figure, were found guilty of threatening John LaMonte, a record wholesaler in Darby, Pa.    The charges stemmed from a major 1986 grand jury indictment of a group of reputed organized-crime members for drug trafficking and business fraud, including extortion in the record industry.    Messrs. Levy, Fisher and Canterino each face a maximum sentence of 40 years in jail. Sentencing has been set for July 8. Their attorneys said they would appeal the verdicts.    Bruce Repetto, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the government case was built largely on tape recordings obtained by wiretaps at Mr. Levy's office and other locations. Mr. LaMonte also taped a conversation with the defendants after he began cooperating with the government investigation in 1985.    During the three-week trial, the jury heard details of the alleged extortion, which followed a 1985 dispute between Messrs. LaMonte and Roulette about payment for $1,250,000 in records and tapes from MCA Inc.'s records division. MCA, Universal City, Calif., wasn't charged.    Mr. Roulette, a distributor, had been billed by MCA for a shipment to Mr. LaMonte's company. A dispute ensued and, the government alleged, Mr. LaMonte was threatened. At issue were deliveries of &quot;cut-out&quot; records, so called because the album covers of such second-market records are usually notched and can't be returned to the producer for full credit.    Mr. LaMonte, who served time in prison following a 1977 conviction for bootlegging records, cooperated with the government's investigation but didn't testify in the case, Mr. Repetto said.    Separate racketeering charges related to the case and involving other defendants are expected to go to trial this fall. </TEXT></DOC>
