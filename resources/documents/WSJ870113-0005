He said he expects &quot;more shoes to drop&quot; following the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal. Mr. Boesky has been cooperating with SEC officials after giving up $50 million in allegedly illicit profits, paying a $50 million fine and agreeing to plead guilty to one criminal count.    The SEC is trying to settle the pending cases through consent judgments. &quot;I would believe that by end (of) spring we will see most cases brought to a successful conclusion,&quot; Mr. Shad told a meeting of investment bankers and financiers. </TEXT></DOC>
