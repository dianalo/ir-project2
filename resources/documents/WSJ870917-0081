The agreement will freeze 1990 world production of the most commonly used chlorofluorocarbons at their 1986 levels and calls for a 50% reduction of world production of the chemicals by mid-1999.    The synthetic compounds of chlorine, fluorine, carbon and sometimes hydrogen are used as cooling agents in refrigerators and air conditioners, as propellents in aerosols and as solvents to clean computer components and in the manufacture of plastic foams. Scientists believe that when the chemicals escape or are released into the atomosphere, they attack the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.    The agreement is expected to lead to higher costs for chlorofluorocarbons and force the chemical industry and users to increase research into substitutes, which include chlorofluorocarbons that are less destructive to ozone.    Signing the agreement were most of the world's major producers of chlorofluorocarbons, including the U.S., Japan and members of the European Community. More than 30 other countries that participated in the conference didn't sign the pact immediately but are expected to sign later.    Lee Thomas, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and head of the U.S. delegation, hailed the agreement as a milestone which he hopes will set a precedent for future international agreements on pollution control.    To take effect, the treaty must be ratified by at least 11 countries, and the nations that ratify it must represent at least two-thirds of world chlorofluorocarbon consumption. In the U.S., ratification means getting Senate approval.    A spokesman for the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, a group of about 500 U.S. makers and consumers of chlorofluorocarbons, also known as CFCs, said he was pleased an agreement was reached. But he said the pact went &quot;much further than we thought necessary, which means the costs will be much higher.&quot; The group had favored a freeze of current output rather than a big cut in production.    Joseph Steed, environmental manager of the freon products division of Du Pont Co., the world's largest chlorofluorocarbon producer, said the controls were tighter than expected a year ago, when the talks began. But he said Du Pont will urge ratification of the treaty both in the U.S. and in other countries where Du Pont operates.    The U.S. accounts for about one-third of world production of chlorofluorocarbons. U.S. manufacturers sell about $750 million of the compounds annually which in turn enter other products and services valued at billions of dollars annually, according to the industry.    The Soviet Union was among the countries that participated in the conference but didn't sign the agreement. Vladimir Zakharov, head of the Soviet delegation, said there are problems with certain aspects of the treaty but he indicated that his country will ratify it. He said the Soviet Union accounts for about 12% of world output of chlorofluorocarbons.    The agreement also calls for a freeze on the consumption of a group of related chemicals, known as halons, in 1992 but there aren't any requirements planned for reductions in consumption. </TEXT></DOC>
