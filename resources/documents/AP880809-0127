Analysts said other interestrates likely would head higher as a result.   With only three months left before the presidential election,the board members, all appointed by President Reagan, sent adramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates todampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering VicePresident George Bush's presidential aspirations.   The increase in the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5percent, was adopted by a 6-0 vote and took effect immediately. Itwas the first change since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highestin more than two years.   An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the Fedcharges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank'smost direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb oneconomic growth.   Economists said jumps in other interest rates, including thoseon mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow.   ``This will hit consumer pocketbooks fairly soon,'' said DavidJones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston, a government securitiesdealer in New York.   He said banks likely will raise their prime rate, the interestthey charge their most creditworthy commercial customers, this weekor next.   Since May, banks have raised their prime rate by a full point to9.5 percent, the highest since March 1986.   And because more people are borrowing through home equity loansand adjustable rate mortgages, which are tied to rate fluctuations,consumers will feel the effects of the Fed's action much morerapidly than in previous years, he said.   Investors, particularly foreign investors, have been skepticalthat the Federal Reserve would have the stomach to make such a movewith the presidential election on the line.   However, with this increase, Jones said, ``I think the Fedproved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does have a backbone andthat it is willing to fight inflation even in an election year.''   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthe administration was disappointed with the increase, but herefrained from criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.   ``We're always disappointed when interest rates go up, but weunderstand there is a reason for it,'' Fitzwater told reporters.``We think the Federal Reserve has done a good job. ... We thinkthe Fed's on the right course.''   The board, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects theintent of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures.''   Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, are expectedto increase by more than 5 percent this year and perhaps more than6 percent next year, analysts are predicting.   By making it more expensive to borrow money, the Fed hopes tocheck inflation by slowing consumer demand. High employment isputting more dollars in the hands of consumers.   At the same time, factories are operating at their highestcapacity levels in eight years. They are straining to produceenough goods for both domestic buyers and foreigners, who have beenbuying more U.S. products in response to the devaluation of thedollar through the end of last year.   The danger of accelerating inflation is present because too manydollars are chasing too few goods.   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., consulting firm, said the discount rate hike likely willpush the value of the dollar, which has been recovering since earlythis year, still higher.   That eventually could choke off the improvement in the U.S.trade deficit by making American products more expensive overseas,he said.   Prices on both the stock and bond markets fell after the Fed'sannouncement.   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the moneysupply this week, but most were expecting the Fed to make the lessdramatic move of pushing up the federal funds rate, the interestbanks charge each other for overnight loans.   However, the Fed noted in its statement that the action it chose``was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest ratesover the discount rate.''   Since early March, it had pushed the federal funds rate up bymore than a percentage point to 7.75 percent while keeping thediscount rate the same.   Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to try tomisuse the ``discount window'' by borrowing from the Fed andlending to other banks at a profit.   Tuesday's discount rate increase was the second rate hike sinceGreenspan became Fed chairman a year ago. In September the centralbank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the firstincrease in three years.   That move also was taken in response to inflationary fears, butwas later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to theOctober stock market crash.   After the crash, the Fed loosened money supplies again inmidwinter, when rising business inventories raised concern that theeconomy was softening.   Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed astrong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation.   Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate hadcome April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9percent.   The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the lastreduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.</TEXT></DOC>
