General</ITAG>The FIRREA, signed into law August 9, 1989 (Pub. L. No. 101-73), immediatelyabolished the FSLIC, and abolished the FHLBB 60 days after enactment. Althoughthese agencies have been abolished, FIRREA provides that FHLBB or FSLICregulations and orders that relate to functions transferred by FIRREA andthat were in effect on August 9, 1989 shall continue in effect accordingto their terms. These rules and regulations are enforceable by or againstthe FDIC, the Director of the OTS, the Federal Housing Finance Board, orthe Resolution Trust Corporation, as the case may be, until the responsibleagency modifies, terminates, sets aside, or supersedes them in accordancewith applicable law. Pursuant to section 401(i) and 402(b) of FIRREA, theChairperson of the FDIC and the Director of the OTS were required to identifythose FHLBB or FSLIC regulations and orders relating to the conduct ofconservatorships and receiverships, the provision, rates or cancellationof insurance of accounts, and the administration of the FSLIC insurancefund which would be enforceable by the FDIC and the OTS, and publish noticeof the allocation of these regulations and others in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This was accomplished in a separate notice documentjointly issued by the two agencies and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 6, 1989 (54 FR 41359).The FDIC is hereby formally transferring those regulations which have beenallocated to it from 12 CFR chapter V to 12 CFR chapter III, and redesignatingthem to conform to the current structure of the FDIC's regulations in 12CFR chapter III.This document establishes subchapter C in title 12, chapter III, of theCode of Federal Regulations, where the transferred and redesignated regulationswill be codified. Subchapter C will be entitled ``Regulations Transferredfrom Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation''.The regulations are being transferred at this time for the purpose of removingthem from 12 CFR chapter V, since the OTS intends to publish its regulationsin that chapter. To expedite this action, no changes (other than theirredesignation) are being made at this time to the content of the transferredregulations; however, the FDIC may take additional action in the futureto modify, amend, or repeal certain of the transferred regulations.The FIRREA abolished the FSLIC insurance fund and established two separateinsurance funds to be administered by the FDIC, the Bank Insurance Fund(``BIF'') and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (``SAIF''). In general(with certain exceptions), members of the BIF are banks, while membersof the SAIF are savings associations (savings and loans and similar institutions).Those regulations transferred from FSLIC relating to the administrationof the FSLIC insurance fund will apply only to members to the SAIF.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Administrative Procedure Act</ITAG>The transferred regulations were previously promulgated by the former FederalHome Loan Bank Board after notice and opportunity for public comment, whererequired. Therefore, a notice of proposed rulemaking and ensuing commentperiod is unnecessary in this case. Moreover, this action merely redesignatescertain regulations from one chapter of the Code of Federal Regulationsto another, without changing the content of those regulations in any way,in order to permit another agency (OTS) to publish its regulations in thechapter being vacated. Accordingly, this redesignation will become effectiveimmediately upon publication.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>No notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this action, so the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do not apply.Accordingly, under the authority of title IV of Public Law 101-73 (103Stat. 183, 354) and as set forth in the preamble, chapter III of title12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by adding a new subchapterC in chapter III, and chapter V of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended by redesignating certain parts and sections of chapter V tochapter III, as set forth below.1. Title 12, chapter III, of the Code of Federal Regulations is amendedby adding a new subchapter C, consisting of parts 382 through 396, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="72">CHAPTER III_FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">SUBCHAPTER C_REGULATIONS TRANSFERRED FROM FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOANINSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Part</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">382 Powers of conservator and conduct of conservatorships.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">383 Powers of receiver and conduct of receiverships.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">384 Application for insurance of accounts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">385 Insured status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">386 Settlement of insurance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">387 Termination of insurance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">388 Receivers for insured institutions other than federal associations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">389 Receivership rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">390 Net worth certificates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">391 Voluntary assisted-merger program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">392 Procedures for the administration and determination of claimsfiled with the FSLIC as receiver.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">393 Presentment of claims to receiver prior to commencing litigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">394 Procedures for the processing and determination on review of determinationsof the FSLIC as receiver.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">395 Procedures for the administration and determination of requestsfor expedited relief from decisions or threatened actions of the FSLICas receiver.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">396 FSLIC financial operations.</ITAG>2.
