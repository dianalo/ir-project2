The data show a characteristic increase followed by a decreasewith the increase in bombarding energy. The fall in the isomer ratiovalues are explained on the basis of enhanced angular momentum depletionby the precompound particles and thereby leaving the compound systemat low angular momentum states. A different reaction mechanism is proposedfor the low yield of the high spin isomer in the ({alpha},{alpha}n) reactionin /sup 85/Rb. (author) 12 refs.; 2 figs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
