he said, &quot;and that is one of the reasons whythe Genesis workshop was designed.&quot;andM;Genesis is a one-day training program that provides training in businessskills while promoting attitudes of productivity and effectiveness.andM;Bunn said the other reason for designing the workshop had to do with therealization that MIS people were not moving up the MIS ladder quickly enough.andM;&quot;Even though there was a great demand for their services, they weren'tpromoted very quickly,&quot; said Bunn.andM;One of the causes that prevented MIS people from getting promotions was theirlack of fundamental business skills, he admitted.andM;&quot;They worked very effectively as a team, but when it came to being introducedto new user-areas, there was no instant credibility that was provided tothem.&quot;andM;Doug Nastel, a Bell Canada data communications specialist who attended aGenesis workshop said, &quot;MIS people get ahead in the profession based on theirtechnical skills at the expense of social skills.andM;&quot;It's almost as if you can sort them and keep them locked in a back room,&quot;said Nastel.andM;He compared the MIS environment to that of a slaughter house.andM;&quot;If you go in the front room in the butcher shop, everything looks quitesharp with everyone wearing white aprons, but if you go to the back it's notlike that at all.&quot;andM;Nastel said he went on the Genesis workshop because he needed to improve someof his &quot;professional skills.andM;&quot;I understand the technology I'm working with, I understand how to get thework done, but I needed to touch up on certain skills that seemed to beholding me back,&quot; he said.andM;Some of the skills Bunn teaches in the workshop include how to plan and usemeetings.andM;&quot;Meetings just have one reason: to use the body of knowledge and thecapabilities that are available to create something new,&quot; Bunn said.andM;He emphasized that emotions play a big role in the creation of something newand therefore must be acknowledged.andM;&quot;Computer people get almost thrown off when they see emotions emerging at ameeting,&quot; Bunn told participants at a recent workshop.andM;He told the students that &quot;letting off steam&quot; is an important aspect whenchairing a meeting.andM;&quot;Letting off the steam is a matter of taking each item on its own  merit andmoving through the process of the meeting.&quot;andM;He compared meetings to riding a bicycle.andP;  &quot;The chairperson sits on it anddoes the pedalling, the rest of the people are the ones pushing the wheels.&quot;andM;Part of the rationale for developing the Genesis program was to provideeducation and training that people could use not only in their jobs, but alsoin their personal lives so that they could become more effective asindividuals, explained Bunn.andM;&quot;Some of the skills that I learned from this workshop like planning and timemanagement are part not only of a job, but of everyday life,&quot; agreed Sze-FenTan, a consultant with Atkinson Tremblay andamp; Assoc.andP;  Inc.andM;Tan said she particularly enjoyed the presentation of the time managementissue.andM;Bunn went over what he called &quot;the most fundamental time managementapproach.&quot; It included: setting goals, listing activities, making a dailythings-to-do list, and acting on A-B-C.andM;&quot;To spend time to plan is time well-spent,&quot; he said.andM;For Greg Parker, a consultant with Toronto-based The Micha Group, a firm thatspecializes in information systems integration, &quot;it's the little things, thelittle aspects and mannerisms that add the professional polish.&quot;andM;Parker, who attended the workshop, said he got the most out of the section onbusiness etiquette.andP;  He said he's already put that aspect in use.andM;Bunn who goes about shaking hands with each participant in the workshop makessure they all give that significant firm handshake.andM;&quot;Don't be afraid to go back and shake hands again with someone if you've feltthat first handshake wasn't good enough,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I've done it and itworked for me.&quot;andM;As for the success of the workshop, Bunn said he's satisfied.andP;  &quot;In one groupthat we trained in June, we spoke to them six months afterwards and out of 16people who attended the workshop, four had already received unforeseenpromotions and 15 of them still use the conference notes or had theconference notes on the corner of their desks.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
