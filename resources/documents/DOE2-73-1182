Consequently, thespecific digging resistances, the load on the machine, the energy consumption,the necessary shut-downs and thus also the maintenance costs can be reduced,whilst at the same time the economy of operation is increased. The fieldtrials carried out so far confirm the advantages of this method.</TEXT></DOC>
