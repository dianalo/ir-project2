The $14 million plant, to be built in Pueblo, Colo., willbe owned by Fuel Resources Development Co., a unit of PublicService Co. of Colorado. The plant is being designed andbuilt by Ultrasystems Engineers and Constructors Inc., a unitof Hadson Corp., Oklahoma City, an energy, defense andconstruction firm.</LP><TEXT>   The plant, which will produce 100 barrels a day of diesel,plus 50 barrels of naptha and 80 barrels of high-grade wax,should be completed around year end, Ultrasystems' president,John P. Coyle, said. The site is estimated to have 20 years'worth of recoverable gas.   While there are other plants that recover landfill gas andturn it into compressed natural gas and other products,officials of the American Gas Association, a Washington-basedindustry group, agreed that Ultrasystems' plant appears to bethe first for converting landfill gas into diesel motor fuel.   Ultrasystems Vice President Jackson Yu explained that theplant will take the landfill gas -- which is roughly 50%-plusmethane and 40%-plus carbon dioxide -- and first chemicallybreak it down into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, or syngas,using basic petrochemical-plant technology.   The syngas then will be run over an iron catalystdeveloped by Rentech Inc., Denver, and be reformed into anumber of hydrocarbon compounds and water. The hydrocarboncompounds then essentially will be refined into diesel,naptha and wax. The refining process is similar to thetechnology that's long been used by South Africa's state oilcompany to make a wide range of petroleum products from coal,AGA officials said.   A spokesman for Public Service of Colorado said theutility believes there is a big market for its version ofdiesel fuel, which it says will be cleaner burning, sulphurfree, and nearly odorless compared to ordinary diesel fuel.Both Colorado and Southern California have majorair-pollution problems and strict pollution-controlregulations. The spokesman said tests have shown that thefuel can be used without a major retrofit of vehicles.   The spokesman declined to say how much the new dieselmight cost, although he said that it will be more expensivethan regular diesel. He added, however, that the price willbe competitive with regular diesel.   In an interview, Richard Braun, executive vice presidentof Fuel Resources, said the company has so far identifiedmore than 100 landfills in the U.S. and Canada that would beeconomically viable candidates for similar plants. He addedthat there are probably many more that haven't yet beenlocated.   A spokesman for the American Trucking Association said hehadn't heard of the new fuel. He added that the associationis currently testing several alternative fuels that promiseto be cleaner-burning than regular diesel, and that theindustry is looking for one that is as close as possible incharacteristics to today's diesel fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
