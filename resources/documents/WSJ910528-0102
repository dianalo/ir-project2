That's not meant as an opinion or advice, but as apolitical reality. If Mr. Thornburgh wants to remain acandidate for higher national office -- the White House, forexample -- he must accede to GOP pleadings that he return toPennsylvania and run for the Senate seat left open by thedeath of John Heinz.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh's rocky three-year tenure as attorneygeneral has tarnished the sterling reputation he earned astwo-term governor of Pennsylvania. If he stiffs his partynow, his already diminished supply of political chits will beblown away altogether.   In fairness, Mr. Thornburgh lately has avoided majordisasters and has performed aggressively as an administrationpoint man in the battles over civil rights and gun-controllegislation. But the attorney general did himself permanentdamage when he botched some early confirmation fights andrelied too heavily on Pennsylvania cronies whose mistakesrequired their banishment or demotion.   &quot;To turn a cabinet job into a platform for higher office,&quot;says Republican consultant Eddie Mahe, &quot;you need to . . .burst onto the national scene with new initiatives, the way,say, Jack Kemp has&quot; as housing secretary. Mr. Thornburgh, headds, &quot;hasn't done that.&quot;   This failure, combined with the longshot GOP drive to wina Senate majority, put a lot of pressure on the attorneygeneral to run. &quot;If he didn't run and we lost the{Pennsylvania} seat this fall, he'd be in trouble,&quot; predictsMr. Mahe, who has advised Mr. Thornburgh in the past.   So that leaves two questions: Why has Mr. Thornburgh beenso coy about committing himself to run, and who will replacehim as attorney general?   One reason he has played cute on the Senate race is thatMr. Thornburgh appears to enjoy the pseudo-suspense. Herelishes the constant questions from reporters about whetherhe'll challenge Democratic candidate Harris Wofford, whoholds the seat temporarily by appointment, in the Nov. 5special election. Asked about his plans at one recent newsconference, a grinning Mr. Thornburgh broke into a tinnyrendition of &quot;Oh What a Beautiful Morning,&quot; from the musical&quot;Oklahoma]&quot;   On a more serious note, according to senior aides, Mr.Thornburgh enjoys having Republican heavyweights visit hisoffice, begging him to get into the race. Senate MinorityLeader Robert Dole and Sen. Phil Gramm, chief GOP recruiterfor Senate candidates, are among those who have paid theirrespects.   Another reason for hesitating is that, despite hisrecognition of political imperatives, Mr. Thornburghgenuinely doesn't want to be the junior senator fromPennsylvania. He disdains the legislative process generallyand hasn't made many friends on Capitol Hill. As a rookielawmaker, he wouldn't get good committee assignments or logmuch time before the television cameras. &quot;He likes to do, andsenators don't do anything,&quot; says Mr. Mahe. &quot;He's anexecutive-branch type.&quot;   Mr. Thornburgh ultimately will hold his nose and take theplunge, perhaps as early as this week. His familiarity toPennsylvania voters and his ability to raise campaign fundsquickly would make him the instant favorite. A short racewill make it even less likely that the Democrats could catchup. (Looking further into the future, Mr. Thornburgh coulduse the platform of a Senate office to run for Pennsylvaniagovernor again, a post his friends say he wouldn't mindgetting back.)   That brings up the matter of who would take over at theJustice Department. Some of the names under consideration atthe White House are surprising. A senior administrationofficial says that the short list now includes Missouri Gov.John Ashcroft, Deputy Attorney General William Barr andTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.   Mr. Ashcroft, a former Missouri attorney general, has thelaw-and-order credentials. Mr. Skinner, by all accounts anadministration standout, has said he's happy where he is anddoesn't want the promotion to attorney general. But heremains a candidate and almost certainly would move up if thepresident asked him to.   Mr. Barr, a skilled bureaucrat and former CentralIntelligence Agency man, has many fans among the moreconservative members of the Bush team. Still, it's surprisingthat the genial 41-year-old is under consideration; fewWashington government junkies, let alone folks outside theBeltway, would recognize his name. He has impressed the WhiteHouse by putting a lid on staff turmoil and forcefullyfending off what the administration calls congressional&quot;micromanagement&quot; of the executive branch.   Now fading as a possible Thornburgh replacement: formerCalifornia Gov. George Deukmejian, who didn't indicate muchinterest in earlier White House feelers.   ---   Mr. Thornburgh suffered an embarrassing courtroom defeatFriday, when a federal judge in San Francisco for the firsttime dismissed a criminal charge because of the attorneygeneral's policy of encouraging prosecutors to negotiate pleabargains behind the backs of defense lawyers.   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel specifically citedthe controversial two-year-old Thornburgh policy as thereason for dismissing charges against an accused cocainetrafficker. Judge Patel said the policy violated court rulesrequiring a lawyer to get the consent of an opposing counselbefore communicating with that counsel's client. In the SanFrancisco case, an assistant U.S. attorney, John Lyons, saidhe acted under a June 1989 directive from Mr. Thornburgh whenhe discussed a possible guilty plea with the defendant, JoseOrlando Lopez. The prosecutor didn't inform the defendant'slawyer of the talks but did tell a U.S. magistrate.   Criminal defense lawyers applauded the decision. &quot;It's theright thing,&quot; said Keith Stroup, executive director of theNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which haslobbied actively against the Thornburgh policy. JusticeDepartment spokesman Douglas Tillett said, &quot;We are reviewingour options, but we anticipate an appeal.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
