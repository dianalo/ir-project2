She wasn't afraid to stand in the lobby andcoax visitors to join. With hardly any budget, Hayes and Dixon not only keptexhibitions coming, they kept the museum alive. Hayes says she's very pleasedto see the new building ready to open.; AVERILL MIX; When the need arises,attorney Averill Mix will put on his hard hat to lead visitors through thebasement of the new wing or dig into his own pockets to help pay for it. Adonor, fund-raiser and volunteer for many arts groups, Mix was introduced tothe museum in the early '70s by one of its founders -- his wife, Ann Marie.;    Since 1984, he has been the mortar holding the building project together,working endless hours with officials and architects. He has been the keyperson, seeing that the architectural plans get carried out properly whilesimultaneously fund-raising.;    &quot;I've been the hair shirt that made everyoneelse do the work,&quot; he says with characteristic modesty. By his smile, however,you can tell he's proud of the results.; GEORGE STARBIRD; Former San JoseMayor George Starbird was instrumental in getting the new wing started. &quot;Whatbothered me from the beginning,&quot; he says, was that &quot;there was a lot ofpressure from the city council to use the land behind the museum for otherthan expansion. If I accomplished anything,&quot; adds Starbird, who served as themuseum's board president from 1974 to '76, &quot;I said that parking lot is ours.&quot;;   Starbird became involved with the museum around 1972, when Charlotte Wendelasked him to follow her as board president. At least, that's his story.According to his wife, Carolyn, George butted in to her territory after shebecame a museum docent in 1972. (She still is.) George agrees that Carolyn isdevoted to her museum work. &quot;She loves to teach people about art,&quot; he says,adding that he's learned from her.; DREW GIBSON; Contemporary art collectorand longtime museum supporter Drew Gibson sometimes feels as if he lives andbreathes the San Jose Museum of Art. &quot;I don't ever want to know how many hoursI've put in. This thing (building and funding the museum) was going to be aone- or two-year experience.&quot;;     Involved with the museum since themid-'70s, Gibson, a businessman, developer and supersalesman, has been one ofthe principal fund-raisers for the expansion, leading the capital campaignfrom 1986 to '91. In March, Gibson once again became a trustee.; CHARLOTTEWENDEL; Charlotte Wendel is what's known in art circles as a museum mama: Shewas a co-founder of the museum, helped finance and develop it, started astrong volunteer force, served as board president and engineered the coup(with Dixon) to reclaim the museum in 1987 and keep it open. &quot;My contributionwas to be  a catalyst for museum programs,&quot; Wendel says modestly.;    Has themuseum accomplished the mission she and co-founders Ann Marie Mix, Barbara M.Cassin and John DeVincenzi had in mind in 1969? &quot;We've raised two decades ofchildren exposed to art and filled the void when Proposition 13 cut artprograms in the schools,&quot; she says. &quot;Yes, the original mission has beenaccomplished, but there's always work ahead.&quot;; JAMES COMPTON; In 1987, JamesCompton's curiosity about the beleaguered San Jose Museum of Art got him moredeeply involved than he ever could have imagined.;    &quot;When Charlotte (Wendel)decided to get some people together during the crisis (that followed theresignation of director John Olbrantz),&quot; Compton recalls, &quot;the first thing Iknew, I was in the middle of it.&quot;;    After joining the board that same year,Compton, a developer and 40-year resident of Santa Clara Valley, reluctantlytook on the presidency in 1989. He is not only a substantial donor to causeshe believes in but gives lots of his own time to help make San Jose &quot;a betterplace for all of us to live.&quot;; ALBERT G. DIXON JR.; Albert G. Dixon Jr. hasspent more years heading the museum -- 11 altogether -- than anyone else. Hehas been director twice, the second time without pay.;    Almost immediatelyafter becoming director in 1973, he, says, &quot;discussions began about renovatingthe building's interior.&quot; No sooner was this accomplished  than planning beganfor the new building.;    In 1982, Dixon resigned from the directorship, onlyto return five years later, keeping the museum open during its darkest days.Asked if he might return to the museum scene sometime, he replies, &quot;Maybe, butnot just yet.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PROFILES BY DOROTHY BURKHART, Mercury News Art Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910526  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  870  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday May 26, 199100147184,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
