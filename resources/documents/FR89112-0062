Pacific Gas Transmission Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-460-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">January 5, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on December 20, 1988, Pacific Gas Transmission Company(PGT), 160 Spear Street, San Francisco, California 94105-1570, filed inDocket No. CP89-460-000 an application pursuant to section 7(c) of theNatural Gas Act (NGA) for a certificate of public convenience and necessityauthorizing PGT to build and operate facilities and authorizing the interstatetransportation of natural gas transported for certain utilities locatedin the Pacific Northwest, the intermountain region and in Southern California(Customers), all as more fully set forth in the request on file with thecommission and open to public inspection.The proposed facilities, PGT states, would complete the looping of PGT'sexisting pipeline within its existing right-of-way (installation of a newpipeline parallel to and interconnecting with the existing pipeline): PacificGas and Electric Company (PGandamp;E) will also expand its California facilitiesto deliver gas to southern California Customers. PGT states that it intendsto provide only firm transportation service on these new, incremental facilities.PGT states that it seeks authorization to construct and operate facilitiesthat would allow approximately 710 MMcf/d of natural gas to be receivedat Kingsgate, British Columbia and, on an average annual basis, approximately150 MMcf/d would be delivered to the existing interconnection with NorthwestPipeline Corporation (Northwest) at Stanfield, Oregon and approximately600 MMcf/d would be delivered to the existing interconnection with PGandamp;Enear Malin, Oregon. Of the 600 MMcf/d which would be transported between Stanfield and Malin,PGT states that 60 MMcf/d will be volumes which PGT currently transportsbetween Kingsgate and Stanfield for its existing customer, Pacific InterstateTransmission Company (PITCO), and for which PGT herein seeks a change indelivery point from Stanfield to Malin. To the extent that Customer demandwarrants it, PGT states that it may supplement this filing by expandingthe capacity of the facilities proposed herein or by adding other deliverypoints along the proposed route in the Pacific Northwest. Between the International Boundary and Stanfield, PGT states that it wouldinstall approximately 104 miles of 42-inch diameter pipeline looping. Southof Stanfield, PGT states that it would install approximately 326 milesof 36-inch diameter pipeline looping to Malin, where PGT's system interconnectswith that of PGandamp;E. The proposed project also includes looping of the PGandamp;E intrastate pipelineswithin the State of Califonia. The proposed 36-inch looping would continuefor 294 miles on PGandamp;E's system to a terminus near Brentwood, California,PGT states. PGandamp;E would also install an additional 120 miles of 36-inchlooping south of Brentwood, paralleling the existing Stanpac No. 2 Pipelineto Panoche Station, PGT adds. PGT states that PGandamp;E would seek appropriatecertificate authorization from the California Public Utilities Commissionfor such facilities. PGT states it is negotiating firm transportation service arrangements forthe proposed service with PITCO as well as with several large southernCalifornia utilities: Southern California Gas Company (SoCal), SouthernCalifornia Edison Company, San Diego Gas and Electric Company, the LosAngeles Department of Water and Power, and the City of Long Beach. PGTstates that it is also negotiating similar firm transportation arrangementswith a number of gas distribution utilities in the Pacific Northwest andthe intermountain region: Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, IGI Resources,Inc., Northwest Natural Gas Company, Washington Natural Gas Company, andWashington Water Power Company. These firm transportation Customers, PGTstates, would be responsible for obtaining natural gas supplies in Canadaand obtaining the requisite Canadian export and U.S import authorizations.This project is intended solely to serve the transportation needs of theseutility Customers, PGT states. PGT states that the Canadian gas purchased by the Customers would be transportedto the international Boundary near Kingsgate, through additional pipelineexpansions in Alberta and southeastern British Columbia. PGT states thatit expects to utilize 100 percent of this capacity for firm transportationservice. Therefore, PGT states, no interruptible transportation serviceis offered by this application and PGT is not currently seeking a blanket``open access'' certificate. PGT states that PGandamp;E, expanding its facilities as necessary, woulddeliver thermally equivalent volumes, adjusted for fuel and line loss,to southern California at the major intrastate interconnection of the PGandamp;Eand SoCal Gas systems at the Kern River Station, near Bakersfield, California.After receipt of gas at the Kern River Station from PGandamp;E, SoCal gaswould provide intrastate transportation for the customers in southern California,PGT states. In the Pacific Northwest and intermountain region, PGT statesthat after receipt of transported gas at the point of interconnection withNorthwest's existing system at Stanfield, Customers would be responsiblefor redelivery of such gas to their own distribution systems. PGT states that its existing compressor stations would be used with centrifugalcompressor aerodynamic assembly changes on five existing units and compressorreplacement at ten existing stations, PGT states. PGT states that existingmetering facilities would be expanded to allow for increased flows. PGT states that total capital costs, including allowance for funds usedduring construction, for PGT's portion of the proposed project are estimated,on a 1988 cost basis, at $470,116,000. PGT states that it proposes conventionalfinancing with a projected mix of 70 percent debt and 30 percent equitycapital. PGT proposes to depreciate these new facilities based on a 30-yeareconomic life. PGT states that it does not request ``cost-of-service''rate treatment for its proposed project. PGT states that the costs for the proposed transportation services includeonly incremental costs and do not include any costs of PGT's existing pipelinesystem. Under this cost allocation proposal, PGT states that its existingcustomers bear no cost responsibility for the new facilities or servicesand have no risk of exposure to any cost responsibility in the event thefacilities are underutilized. PGT states that it proposes to provide new firm transportation service,based on the incremental cost of the Expansion Project, via new Rate SchedulesT-3 and T-4. Rate Schedule T-3 is for firm transportation service for gasreceived at Kingsgate, or Stanfield, and delivered to Malin. Rate ScheduleT-4 is for firm transportation service for gas received at Kingsgate, anddelivered to Stanfield.   PGT states that the proposed rate structure consists of a two-part monthlyreservation charge using a D-1 and D-2 component, each designed to recover50 percent of the total fixed cost of the expansion based upon a maximumdaily and annual delivery quantities, respectively. No usage charge orcommodity charge is proposed. PGT also requests the authority to negotiateindividual reservation charges which may be lower than the maximum. Customersagreeing to pay a lower reservation charge would then pay a usage chargeequal to the difference between the maximum reservation charge stated inthis application and the negotiated reservation charge, PGT adds. PGT statesthat firm transportation priorities would be based on the present valueof the Customer's per unit reservation charge.PGT states its proposed rates as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10,10</C> <H1>Pro forma rate schedule</H1><H1>Monthly reservation charges</H1><H1>D-1</H1><H2>D-2</H2>T-3:<ITAG tagnum="3">Kingsgate, British Columbia to Malin, Oregon</ITAG><D>$5.070356</D><D>$0.196118</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Stanfield, Oregon</ITAG><D>2.774103</D><D>0.107301</D><ITAG tagnum="1">T-4: Kingsgate, British Columbia to Stanfield, Oregon<D>2.296257</D><D>0.088818</D></ITAG></ITAG>PGT states that it projects that on or about November 30, 1993, it wouldbegin deliveries for the Customers, assuming the receipt of all necessaryregulatory approvals and the completion of necessary preconstruction activitiesin time to allow construction to begin in early 1992.<T3>Comment date: </T3>January 26, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84"> 3.
