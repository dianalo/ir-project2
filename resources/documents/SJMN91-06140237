Lucente said this was a mistake andit should have been 55, the age recognized at all U.S. Golf Association andNorthern California Golf Association tournaments for male amateurs.;    &quot;Andour tournament committee last June did vote to raise it to 55 starting withthis year's tournament,&quot; Lucente said. &quot;But last month some committee peoplebegan campaigning again for 50. They voted 50 back in. I was upset. I resignedas co-chairman and walked out of the meeting. I'm through with it unless theyget it back to 55.&quot;;    Lucente, 69, one of the top senior amateurs inNorthern California, also has competed in the tournament, although he hasnever won the senior title. Ironically, the tournament's senior trophy iscalled the &quot;Hank Lucente Perpetual Trophy.&quot;;    &quot;I was really hurt by theirdecision,&quot; Lucente said. &quot;I worked so hard for so many years to keep thistournament going. We almost lost it a couple times.&quot;;    Buzz Schulte, who wasco-chairman with Lucente, said the committee was &quot;saddened&quot; at Lucente'sresignation.;    &quot;Hank has given a lot to the tournament for many years,&quot;Schulte said. &quot;I know the committee has the door open to him to return orexpress his opinions anytime. It was a case of the committee deciding it oneway, and majority rules. Maybe Hank is correct. But at this point thecommittee voted otherwise. You never know -- nothing is set in concrete.&quot;;   Bill Paulson, NCGA executive director, understands the problem.;    &quot;Guys 50to 55 are in kind of a time warp,&quot; Paulson said. &quot;They no longer can competewith the young guys. Their athletic ability has waned somewhat. Until theyturn 55, they sort of bide their time. There has been some talk of going to 50in the NCGA, but right now it's 55. The San Francisco City and AlamedaCommuters tournaments are 55, although I see the Nevada Amateur now has goneto 50.&quot;;  BRODIE SNAFU: Some reports said John Brodie withdrew from that PGASenior tournament last Sunday in Frisco, Texas. But actually he wasdisqualified.;    How did Brodie mess up when he was only one shot out of thelead going into Sunday's final round? Don't ask. That is, don't ask Brodie,who was steaming when he walked off the course.;    According to Fort WorthStar-Telegram writer Jim Burch, Brodie became irritated during the roundbecause his pro playing partner, Lloyd Moody, passed on the chore of keepingBrodie's score to his (Moody's) caddie. Normally, each player's score is keptby another pro in the group.;    &quot;Brodie wouldn't talk to the press about it,but I overheard him say this caddie made several scoring errors during theround,&quot; Burch said. &quot;Then, in the scorer's tent, the caddie gave the card toMoody, who signed it, but on the line where Brodie was supposed to sign.Brodie saw a signature and believed he had signed the card. Then Moody noticedhis mistake, erased his name and re-signed on the proper line. The card wasturned in without Brodie's signature and he was disqualified.&quot;;    Brodie, anon-winner on the Senior Tour, would have finished 13th. The snafu cost him$7,548.;  LPGA EDICT: The LPGA has informed all golf clubs with discriminatorypolicies that are to be tournament sites on the 1992 schedule to shape up orthey will be dropped.;    How many clubs is that? Commissioner Howard MechemJr. would only say: &quot;A few.&quot;;    If the LPGA's San Jose Classic were stillbeing held at Almaden Golf andamp; Country Club, club officials say, they wouldn'tanticipate a problem. &quot;Almaden has no discrimination against any race, sex,religion, whatever,&quot; Club Manager Bruce Goedde said.;    The club has severalminority and three women members, though no blacks.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dan Hruby  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910519  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  712  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday May 19, 199100140237,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
