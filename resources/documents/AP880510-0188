Monday evening's bombardment of Kabul with 17 surface-to-surfacerockets killed 23 civilians and wounded 28 people, Afghan radiosaid.   Western diplomatic sources said Indian diplomats had fledAfghanistan's second largest city, Kandahar, as the rebels overransecurity zones in heavy fighting near the southeastern provincialcapital. Its population has dwindled from 200,000 to 20,000 aspeople fled the eight-year civil war.   The capture of Kandahar would represent a major defeat for theforces of President Najib, who has vowed to defend hisSoviet-backed government after Moscow withdraws an estimated115,000 troops from Afghanistan under an April 14 accord.   However, the government commands only about 50,000 troops of itsown, and the Pakistani-based guerrilla forces number about 200,000.   The Afghan radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said Tuesdaythat one rocket roared into a house in southern Kabul, killing fivemembers of a family. Six people were killed in a playground in thecenter of the capital, it said.   The report also said some victims were returning home from work.   The ruling Communist Party condemned the rocket attacks Tuesday,describing them as ``crimes committed by the enemies of peace andpeace-loving citizens,'' the broadcast said.   Interior Minister Gen. Mohammad Gulabzoi appealed to people tocooperate with the government in ``preventing enemy actions.''   Soviet forces have begun handing over security to Kabul's troopsas Moscow prepares for its pullout beginning May 15.   Soviet soldiers reportedly had increased security in the face ofintense fighting last week in the Panjshir Valley located betweenKabul and the Hindukush range.   Diplomats, citing colleagues in Kabul, said nightly Soviettransport flights at Kabul airports remained heavy, indicating amassive resupply of Afghan forces.   Medical staff at Kabul hospitals were reporting a near-recordnumber of land mine casualties, including refugees and othercivilians.   Guerrilla leaders estimate there are 5.5 million land minesspread around Afghanistan.   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to backthe Afghan government in its war with the guerrillas.
