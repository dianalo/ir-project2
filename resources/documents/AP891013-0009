I believe that the American flag is a unique and special symbolof our nation and it should be protected from desecration, and ouradministration has proposed a constitutional amendment to protectthe flag because we believe that is the most _ the most lasting andlegally correct means of protection, a constitutional amendment.   And yesterday, the House of Representatives agreed to a Senatebill providing statutory protection for the flag, and when thismeasure comes to the House, I will allow the bill to become law,but without my signature. And I am withholding that signature tosignal our belief that a constitutional amendment is the best wayto provide lasting protection for the flag.   We will continue to work for such an amendment, and I canunderstand the rationale of those who voted for this legislation,but in my view it is not the ultimate answer, and therefore I willnot put my signature on the legislation.   I would now be glad to take questions, all of which, I am surewill be on the flag.   Q. Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. President. You have said onseveral occasions that you knew everything at the time of thePanamanian coup, and you didn't feel that there were any reallyproblems in retrospective. At the same time, there are many reportsthat you've changed the rules of procedure on handling _ on crisismanagement, and that you have asked the Hill for more authority tooperate during a coup or plan a coup or whatever. Can youstraighten this out for us? And ...   A. Let me help you out.   Q. Obviously there were glitches, or you wouldn't have spent twoweeks trying to defend yourself _ I mean, the administration.   A. Well, I'm not sure I agree to the last part.   Q. You have spent two weeks trying to explain to the Americanpeople what you did.   A. No, this is the first chance _ shot I've had at explaining.   Q. Not you per se, but your administration.   A. Oh, I see. No, I _ what was the first part of the question?   Q. That you have changed the procedures on crisis management,and ...   A. No, look, here's what _ it's coming back. Here is myposition. I have not seen any fact in all the reports that havecome out that would make me have done something different in termsof use of force. And I reiterate that. Now, in terms of procedures,I'll simply say, any time we can make improvements, so much thebetter. But there has not been an intelligence gap that would havemade me act in a different way. And so _ and I repeat that.   And there's been endless interviews and discussions and stories,many of which are false, that come out as to what we were asked todo or not to do. But I've seen no fact that would make me change myview. And I've seen allegations that we had _ if when I said Iwanted Noriega to get out there, that implied use of force. I hopeI would never be reckless enough as a commander-in-chief to make ablanket commitment to use of force if _ without knowing the factsregarding some coup attempt.   We want to see Mr. Noriega out. I'll repeat that. I've been veryheartened by the reports from various leaders in our hemisphere.</TEXT><TEXT>   about what Noriega should do. So _ but I don't see any seriousdisconnects at all. And if we can fine tune our crisis managementsystem, so much the better. And I think that's what you're readingabout now.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
