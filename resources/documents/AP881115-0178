The march coincided with a meeting of the General Assembly of theOrganization of American States. Peace in Central America is amongthe topics being discussed during the week-long meeting of delegatesfrom 31 nations.   An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people marched in the processionthat stretched more than 2 miles. Protesters walked from the city'seastern edge to the hotel where the OAS meeting is being held inwestern San Salvador.   ``The struggle for peace is the duty of all!'' chanted themarchers beneath hundreds of blue-and-white Salvadoran flags, whiteflags symbolyzing peace and banners with slogans demanding an end tothe bloodshed.   Organizers of the event, including dozens of anti-governmentlabor, peasant, student, church and human rights organizations,called it ``The Great March for Peace and a Political Solution tothe Conflict.''   Participants represented a cross-section of Salvadoran society,with straw-hatted, sandaled peasants walking alongside factoryworkers and neatly attired white-collar workers.   The Salvadoran armed forces, battling a Marxist-led insurgency,had said the march was part of a guerrilla plan to disrupt thecapital during the OAS meeting. The army also accused organizers ofseeking to provoke government forces.   But the march was peaceful as both armed forces and demonstratorsapparently made efforts to avoid violence.   Troops and police took up positions a few blocks from theSheraton Hotel, where the OAS is meeting, to prevent the marchersfrom reaching the general assembly site. Instead, demonstratorsgathered at a nearby traffic circle where they sang songs andlistened to speeches.   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of themcivilians.   The centrist government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte demandsthat the guerrillas lay down their arms and incorporate themselvesinto the democratic process.   The guerrillas and their civilian political supporters contendDuarte's government is a facade for military domination and thatelections have been a farce.   The guerrillas last week declared a unilateral truce for theduration of the OAS meeting and renewed a call for negotiations withthe government.   The army rejected the move as propaganda, and on Tuesday, theArmed Forces Press Office said the rebels violated their cease-fireby shooting at government forces.   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, therebels charged the army with ``provocation,'' and said any fightingwas the result of army offensive action.   Three rounds of government-rebel negotiations in recent yearshave been fruitless.   ``The government has not demonstrated sincerity in previousnegotiations,'' said an Episcopal Church worker taking part in themarch. ``But negotiation is the only way. By pursuing militarymeans, there will only be more dead.''   He declined to be identified. Activists in El Salvador arereluctant to be quoted by name. In the early 1980s, soldiers anddeath squads linked to the military were blamed for the kidnap andmurder of thousands of suspected leftists.   Duarte, in his address Monday to OAS delegates, said theguerrillas' expressed desire to resume negotiations was merely``tactical.'' He accused the rebels of pursuing ``a strategicmaneuver to destroy democracy through democracy's own liberties.''</TEXT></DOC>
