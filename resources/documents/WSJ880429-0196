On March 21, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City granted Geico a stay of the Insurance Commission's ruling, which allows Geico to continue to deny insurance to new applicants who own radar detectors until the case is decided on appeal.    The only reason people use radar detectors is to speed, and speeders cause more accidents than those who don't. Studies by the Maryland State Police, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Goodson Engineering, Dunlap and Associates, the University of Indiana Institute for Research in Public Safety, the National Safety Council and others have correlated speeding with radar detectors and with increased accident frequency.    By allowing Geico to deny auto-insurance coverage to radar-detector owners, the courts will protect law-abiding policyholders from having to subsidize the damage caused by radar-detector owners.
