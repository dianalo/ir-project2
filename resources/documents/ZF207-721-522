(Fiber Distributed DataInterface network)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Flanagan, Patrick.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) local area networks (LANs)are considered by many to be the key networking strategy for the1990s, mainly because of FDDI's high-speed capabilities and itslack of proprietary technology.andP;  The FDDI market is expected togrow 58 percent annually until 1993.andP;  Current implementations ofFDDI networks are being used to link workstations to LANs or ashigh-speed backbone networks.andP;  The advantages offered by FDDI useare improved signal quality, security, and reliability, as well asgiving corporations a competitive advantage.andP;  Three elements arenecessary before FDDI networks can be implemented on a wide scale:bridge/routers, chip sets that let the bridge/routers work off aplug-in board and network management software.andP;  Bridge/routers canbecoming commonplace.andP;  The chip sets and software developmentstill moving slowly.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber Distributed Data Interface StandardLocal Area NetworksFiber OpticsStandardsMarket Analysis.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographgraph.andO;Caption:   U.S. fiber-optic lan revenue forecast.
