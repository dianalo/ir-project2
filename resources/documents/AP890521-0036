In their latest leaflet, Palestinian underground leaders vowedto kill an Israeli soldier or settler for every Arab killed byIsraeli troops.   Israel's army is on the offensive against Palestinian unrest,killing 33 Arabs and wounding 435 so far this month. The governmentalso has increased economic pressure, putting the Gaza Strip's700,000 Palestinians under curfew for eight days and requiringpermits to work in Israel.   Palestinian leaders have so far persuaded protesters to use justbottles and stones in clashes with Israeli troops. But with 496Arabs killed since the uprising began in December 1987, Palestinianintellectuals say there is growing pressure to use guns.   ``The ground is shaking under those who urge restraint,'' said aprominent Palestinian. He spoke on condition of anonymity, sayinghe feared arrest if he spoke openly.   ``There is a feeling among some young activists that the onlyway to make the Americans force Israel to make policy changes isfor Israel to pay a higher cost, to send Israelis back incoffins,'' he said.   Concurrently, there is growing pressure from Israeliright-wingers, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, to usewhatever force is necessary to crush the violent protests.   How far Israel would actually go in using military force remainsto be seen. But one official said Israel needs to widen thebattlefield and use ``administrative violence'' to hit Arabs in thepocketbook and other aspects of day-to-day life.   ``We need to fight in all fields of life, not just thestreets,'' he said.   Such action, the official said, would persuade Palestinians toadopt a more realistic view of possible political settlements andgive up militant nationalist aspirations.   The crackdown on Palestinian workers is especially severe sincewages from Israel, which were $700 million in 1987, accounted forabout one-third of the occupied territories' gross nationalproduct. About 50,000 of the 700,000 Palestinians from the GazaStrip and 60,000 of the 1 million West Bank residents work inIsrael.   On the Palestinian side, there have been several signs ofescalating violence.   On Friday, for the first time, there was a gun battle betweentroops and armed Palestinians. One soldier died and three Arabswere killed. Palestinians also have stepped up killings ofsuspected army collaborators.   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat told reporters in Baghdad, Iraq, thatPalestinians may be forced to use arms if Israeli forces continueto kill Arab demonstrators.   And in an interview with the Kuwaiti daily Al Watan, MohammedAbbas, a leading PLO figure, called for the use of firearms. ``Weare convinced that diplomacy has a time and the stone has a time,but I see that the time nas now come to use arms in support of theintefadeh,'' he was quoted as saying.   But there are questions whether Palestinians would use arms orwhether such threats are rhetoric to make Israel back away fromhard-line policies.   Arieh Shalev, a retired general and West Bank military governorin 1974-76, said Palestinians lack adequate weapons to mount aneffective guerrilla war. He said Palestinians risk harsh Israelireprisals if they fight with firearms.   Palestinian moderates have expressed concern the PLO wouldabandon the policy of unarmed resistance and risk losinginternational backing.   ``I am against escalation on our side. I think we should try tokeep the intefadeh bloodless,'' said Ziad Abu Ziad, a Palestinianactivist who edits the biweekly Hebrew-language newsletter Gesher,or bridge, aimed at an Israeli audience.   But he said Palestinian anger is rising over the lack of Israeliresponse to demands for an end to the occupation, the number ofprotesters killed and wounded and collective punishments such ascurfews and work restrictions.   ``These measures are responsible for any escalation that occurson the Palestinian side,'' he said.   Faisal Husseini, who heads a Palestinian study center inJerusalem, said Israel is at a crossroads. The government mustdecide whether to accept Palestinian demands for statehood orcontinue with a policy of confrontation.   ``The situation is more dangerous now. People are so angry,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
