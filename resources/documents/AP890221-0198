British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher unsuccessfully tried topersuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl to go forward with the replacementof short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany.   At the end of the talks with Kohl in Frankfurt, Mrs. Thatcheralso confidently predicted that the European Economic Community'swithdrawal of top-ranking diplomats from Iran will be ``verysuccessful.''   The 12 EEC nations decided on the move after Iran called for thedeath of author Salman Rushdie, author of the novel ``The SatanicVerses,'' which Moslems believe is blasphemous.   During a post-summit news conference, Kohl and Mrs. Thatcherfaced a round of questions replacing the approximately 600 Lancenuclear missiles in West Germany.   ``Constancy is a very good factor,'' Mrs. Thatcher said,referring to her government's insistence on replacement of themissiles. ``Constancy and consistency in politics are very strong,very rare, alas all too rare.''   In a joint statement, the two leaders reaffirmed the stance ofthe March 1988 NATO summit, which called for nuclear weapons to be``kept up to date where necessary.'' They also agreed to meet inApril in Kohl's hometown of Oggersheim to discuss the missile issue.   ``We shall meet again before the next NATO summit (in May) withthe objective of making it a success. And I don't think we can gofurther than that at present,'' she told more than 150 journalistsgathered at Frankfurt's City Hall.   Last week, Kohl and visiting U.S. Secretary of State James A.Baker attempted to minimize differences over the missile issue.   Kohl wants the decision on replacing the weapons put off until1991 or 1992, after next year's national elections.   NATO calls the plan ``modernization,'' but West German officialssay it really is the replacement of the aging Lance missiles withnew longer-range missiles capable of traveling about 300 miles. TheLance missiles, pointed at East Germany and Czechoslovakia, have arange of nearly 75 miles.   West Germany fears that replacing the missiles could derailefforts to improve East-West relations.</TEXT></DOC>
