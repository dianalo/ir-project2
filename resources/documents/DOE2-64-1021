<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-1021 </DOCNO><TEXT>Results are presented for two experimental programs related to augmentationof heat transfer by complex flow characteristics. In one program, highfree stream turbulence (up to 63 percent) was shown to increase the Stantonnumber by more than a factor of 5, compared with the normally expectedvalue based on x-Reynolds number. These experiments are being conductedin a free-jet facility, near the margins of the jet. To a limited extent,the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and integral length scale canbe separately varied. The results show that scale is a very importantfactor in determining the augmentation. Detailed studies of the turbulencestructure are being carried out using an orthogonal triple hot-wire anemometerequipped with a fourth wire for measuring temperature. The v' componentof turbulence appears to be distributed differently from u' or w'. Inthe second program, the velocity distributions and boundary layer thicknessesassociated with a pair of counter-rotating, streamwise vortices weremeasured. There is a region of considerably thinned boundary layer betweenthe two vortices when they are of approximately the same strength. Ifone vortex is much stronger than the other, the weaker vortex may belifted off the surface and absorbed into the stronger.</TEXT></DOC>
