The government said Monday it averted the planned coup Sunday bya group of army officers against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who cameto power in a military takeover a month ago.   Government spokesman Frantz Lubin said the plot against Avrilwas led by Sgt. Patrick Frantz Bochard, who headed a governmentlottery, and former Col. Samuel Jeremie, a convicted murderer whohad escaped from prison.   Radio Soliel said ``several soldiers were wounded'' and 30 werearrested in the attempted takeover.   Lubin said some soldiers were arrested, but he gave no figureand said he could not confirm the radio report indicating theremight have been shooting.   ``Certain other officers have been discharged,'' Lubin said.``They had maneuvered to stage a coup'' against Avril.   He said he had no further information.   Hubert de Roncery, a conservative politician, called Jeremie ``apillar'' of the Duvalier dictatorship and said there could be ``analliance in the works between the soldiers and the TontonMacoutes.''   The Tonton Macoutes were tcceeded his father. The dictatorshipended when the younger Duvalier fled to France in 1986 duringanti-government violence.   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy headed a three-man junta until generalelections in January. Namphy staged a coup in June, oustedPresident Leslie Manigat and took power. A month ago, the50-year-old Avril deposed Namphy and declared himself president.   About 6,000 people demonstrated Monday near the National Palaceto protest a directive by the Roman Catholic Church that wouldtransfer the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide out of Haiti.   Among the causes of last month's coup was an attack onAristide's church in the capital. Men armed with guns, machetes andclubs burst into the church during Mass, killing 12 people,wounding 70 and setting the building on fire. Aristide was notinjured.   The Haitian priest said Oct. 10 that he was told by hissuperiors in Rome to leave Haiti and that they set Monday as thedeadline for his departure. He did not elaborate, but a friend saidAristide had been told to report to a parish in Montreal.   Another friend said Aristide was still in Haiti on Monday.   Aristide is an advocate of liberation theology and has said thechurch must take an active role against social justices. Somechurch leaders have criticized Aristide for his stand.   Catholic-run Radio Soleil said the situation was too``explosive'' for Aristide to leave now and his transfer couldcreate more unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
