(Products)Dragon Systems Inc. (Products).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Product:   VoiceType (Sound processing software) (Design and construction)Dragon Systems DragonDictate 30K (Voice input-output device)(Design and construction).andO;Topic:     Voice recognition.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>About the only thing Frank Whitney will not say to his computer is &quot;reboot.&quot;andO;Otherwise, the Defense Department computer analyst talks rather freely to his386.andM;With an acoustic board and speech recognition software running in his PC atthe National Security Agency, Whitney can log onto Unix workstations with asimple voice command, despite a physical impairment that prevents him fromeasily using a computer keyboard.andM;That same technology moved into the mainstream multimedia spotlight lastmonth when IBM Corp. announced its first speech recognition product.andP;  IBMVoice Type, at $3,185, is priced to reach a wide range of users who need orprefer to use voice commands to interact with computers.andM;&quot;Voice Type fits squarely into the whole multimedia arena,&quot; said Janet Baker,president of Dragon Systems Inc. of Newton, Mass., which licensed itstechnology to IBM.andM;In 1986 and again in 1990, Dragon Systems won contracts from the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency in Washington to develop speech recognitiontechnology, and since then the company has been able to improve the speed andaccuracy of its productivity by incorporating statistical semantic analysis.andM;Beta Version of 1.5 of Dragon Systems' DragonDictate is the hardware/softwarepackage Whitney runs on his 20-MHz 386 computer at work and 33-MHz 386 athome.andP;  A 486 would give 20 percent greater throughout over a 386 in terms ofhow fast you can speak and be understood, Whitney said.andM;Professionals such as doctors and lawyers account for almost half of thespeech recognition packages Dragon has sold since it introduced a commercialspeech recognition package in 1990, Baker said.andM;The $9,000 DragonDictate package has acoustic models for 25,000 frequentlyused words and slots for 5,000 words users can add to its recognitionvocabulary.andM;DragonDictate and IBM VoiceType enable people to work with popularapplications such as MS-DOS, WordPerfect, dBase and Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  A full setof voice-defined macros perform many of the different keystroke sequencesrequired to run those popular applications.andM;The software transcribes speech at the rate of 30 to 40 words per minute andworks best when the speaker leaves discrete quarter second pauses betweeneach spoken word.andM;For words the software does not recognize, the user spells the word using theNATO alphabet: &quot;a&quot; is &quot;alpha,&quot; &quot;c&quot; is &quot;charlie,&quot; and so forth.andP;  Usually afterdictating only the first few letters of the word, Whitney said, the softwarerecognizes the word by matching those initial letters against the80,000-word, on-line Random House Unabridged Dictionary.andM;The minimum hardware required to run the package is a 20-MHz 80386microprocessor, 8M of RAM, 10M of available harddisk space and a high-densityfloppy drive.andP;  Whitney recommends nothing less than 65M to 80M of hard diskspace.andM;VoiceType, which IBM will ship in August, has 5,000 speech models and acapacity for 2,000 user-defined words.andP;  The VoiceType package includes aheadset microphone but not the audio board.andM;The IBM product requires a 16-MHz or faster IBM PS/2 with a 386SX, 386, 486SXor 486 microprocessor.andP;  IBM VoiceType also requires IBM's audio captureplayback adapter.andP;  Users also must have MS-DOS 5.0, 6M of RAM and a recommend60M hard disk to run IBM VoiceType.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
