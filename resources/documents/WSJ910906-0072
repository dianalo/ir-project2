Now it's a contenderfor bedpan capital.   As in many American cities, doctors' offices have replacedsmokestacks. Most of the big brass companies in Waterburyhave been closed for years, leaving the two local hospitalsas the biggest private employers. More than 10,000 workersfrom the area's labor force -- 12.6% of the total -- earntheir livelihood in the health industries now, a tenfoldincrease from 1970, when a mere 1.6% were in health care.</LP><TEXT>   No one, for example, makes brass tubing at the oldAnaconda-American Brass factory on Grandview Street anymore.They go to the doctor there. The vast brick mill sat empty,windows smashed, for a decade before it was restored in theearly 1980s. Today its tenants are an ambulatory surgicalcenter, a health maintenance organization, a chiropractor, agroup of pediatricians and the headquarters of a 25-physicianeye-care center. In the meantime, doctors have become some ofthe richest folks in town, a local banker notes, oftenresiding in Waterbury's toniest neighborhood near the countryclub.   Cities such as Waterbury symbolize the extraordinarygrowth of health services in recent years -- a growth thathas pushed the nation's annual health expenditures to nearly$700 billion, more than 12% of the U.S. gross nationalproduct. Government efforts to cut back costs have squeezedcertain hospitals, including those in Waterbury. But overall,medical costs have continued to soar.   Still, the bulging health-care sector has also given a bigboost to numerous communities -- and eased the pain ofrecession. The paradox complicates the growing efforts tooverhaul the nation's health-care system. While manyAmericans feel the system is expensive, inefficient,inflationary and unfair, they have become increasinglyreliant on it.   At Manpower Temporary Services Inc.'s office here,premiums for the employee health plan have more thanquadrupled in the past 10 years and, to fight back, thecompany has twice switched insurance carriers. But Gary Post,the office's manager, says local health-care providers,particularly the two hospitals, are some of Manpower'sbiggest customers.   &quot;I catch it from the business community about the highcosts of health care killing us all,&quot; says John Tobin,president of Waterbury Hospital. &quot;I know health-care costsare a problem for local employers. But we also are a majoremployer ourselves and a major purchaser of services, and Iwould think a source of stability in the downturn.&quot;   Nationwide, over the past year the health-servicesindustries have been the only major sector of the nationaleconomy to grow. In the face of recession, health-careemployers added 383,000 jobs between July 1990 and July 1991,according to the U.S. Labor Department. That's an increase of4.9%, while the overall number of jobs in the private sectordwindled 1.3%. More than 9% of all private, nonagriculturalworkers in the U.S. are now employed in the health-deliveryservices, up from 3% in 1960.   &quot;I think in the past year or two health care has reallybeen a blessing for the U.S. economy because it's helpedcushion the shock of economic decline,&quot; says Sung Won Sohn,chief economist of Norwest Corp., the Minneapolis bankingcompany. The twin cities have seen local health-care jobsincrease 4.0% over the past year, while overall employmenthas edged up only 0.4%.   Economists say health-care jobs helped soften Texas'sreal-estate and oil crash in the 1980s. Health care wascritical in transforming Pittsburgh's economy from steel toservices (11% of the city's labor force works in the healthservices now). Health care is even helping offset the U.S.trade deficit; exports of medical equipment andpharmaceuticals consistently post one of the U.S.'s biggesttrade surpluses.   But this dependence on an expanding medical industry foreconomic health clashes with the desire to trim costs,especially &quot;when those savings result in the loss of jobs,&quot;notes Edward Howard, executive vice president of the Alliancefor Health Reform. &quot;Hospitals in particular are largecollections of economic activity. And everybody knows that ifyou close one down it's going to cost lots of jobs. As aresult it's extremely difficult to close one down.&quot;   Waterbury, a predominantly middle- and working-class citythat wends up steep hills from Connecticut's Naugatuck River,shows just how much some local economies depend on healthcare, both for providing jobs and for purchasing goods andservices.   After much of its downtown declined in the mid-1970s, thiscity of 108,000 people caught some of the 1980s boom in realestate and financial services. A variety of smallmanufacturers and service firms replaced heavy manufacturing.And, as in many towns, health-care providers began toproliferate, supported by eager consumers, a growingpopulation of elderly, the proximity of top medical schoolsand state rules that mandate that certain benefits be offeredby health-insurance plans.   To be sure, Waterbury has felt the recession. On a drizzlysummer afternoon, a man squatting near a highway entrance inthe city clutches a soggy sign that says, &quot;Will Work ForFood.&quot; The latest unemployment rate is a painful 11.9%.What's more, condominiums in Waterbury that were appraised atmore than $200,000 in the late 1980s are now selling foraround $130,000.   But while many employers were letting workers go, thehealth services brought some 600 new jobs to Waterbury andsurrounding towns between last spring and this spring,according to the state labor department. &quot;This has actuallyhelped stabilize the Waterbury area,&quot; says Nicholas Perna,chief economist at Shawmut National Bank in Hartford.   Thanks to St. Mary's Hospital, Stephen Lombard is finallyworking again. The brawny, friendly 52 year old was laid offfrom his job as a sales executive at a local company lastyear. He was unemployed for nine miserable months. Finally,he beat out several applicants for a job as a security guardat the Catholic hospital.   Like many health-service jobs the pay isn't great -- abouthalf the $45,000 Mr. Lombard was making in the corporateworld. But to him the job is a godsend. &quot;The pressure isless,&quot; he says. &quot;I love it. It's very rewarding.&quot;   Health care also is providing solid business to firms thathave nothing to do with tonsillectomies or teeth-cleaning:banks, builders, real-estate developers, food distributors,landscapers and contractors.   St. Mary's, a sprawling 347-bed institution that sitsacross from an abandoned brass factory that will soon berazed, is just completing a $19 million expansion project. Itadded a new parking garage, auditorium, maternity ward andclinical lab. Waterbury Hospital is beginning a $20 millionrenovation project.   Paul Dinto Electrical Contractors Inc.'s biggest job rightnow is a $1.5 million contract for all of the rewiring in theWaterbury Hospital project. More than half of the company'swork now is coming from health-care facilities, says ThomasTowhill, vice president. Since the collapse of the commercialreal-estate business, that's most of the big work that'sleft.   These days, much of Norman Drubner's livelihood is comingfrom health-care providers, too. He owns a commercial andindustrial real-estate brokerage firm -- and doctors areabout his best business.   &quot;They're going to pay their bills, and they're the onlyones looking for space,&quot; Mr. Drubner says. &quot;This is reallyright now the only growth industry.&quot;   Mr. Drubner renovated an old brass-company office buildingdowntown in the mid-1980s and hoped to lease it out as acorporate headquarters. There were no takers. &quot;Now,&quot; he says,&quot;the second floor has been taken over by a practice ofneurosurgeons. They're rehabbing it. They're almost triplingtheir space.&quot;   What some critics have dubbed the medical &quot;arms race&quot; --the quest for the latest costly technology -- is thriving inWaterbury, generating still more jobs.   Though they are only five minutes away from each other,both hospitals now have magnetic resonance imagers,remarkable but expensive diagnostic machines. Nearby, atwo-physician radiology practice is eager to get an MRI, too.One of the partners, Medhi Eslami, says if the practice winsthe required approval from the state to buy the $2 millionmachine, it will add five people to its 11-person staff,largely to help handle the new business the MRI will bringin.   Dr. Eslami is optimistic. &quot;We are going to get one rain orshine,&quot; he vows, busily studying X-rays on a day when thestate government is partially shut down for lack of a statebudget.</TEXT></DOC>
