The shrinkage isdue to mergers, consolidations, acquisitions, and -- the 1986 oil pricecrash. A graph compares differing levels of market concentration amongvarious sectors of the US energy industries for 1975 vs. 1986. Marketconcentration has fallen for most US energy sectors. A slight declinein the index of total US energy production has occurred over the period.Two sectors stand out as less concentrated than the others: natural gasproduction and coal production. The refining and interstate oil pipelinessectors are at higher concentration levels than the other sectors, butthey still fall within the unconcentrated range as defined by the USDepartment of Justice.
