Eastern filed a plan on July 21 for cash refunds to people holding unused tickets bought before the airline filed for reorganization under bankruptcy-law proceedings on March 9 and trimmed flight schedules. The department said many ticketholders may not know about the deadline next week because the Texas Air Corp. unit and the court had advised consumers to wait to file claims until a procedure for doing so was established.    The refund plan must still be approved by the bankruptcy court. But Eastern ticketholders, as well as people with unresolved baggage or cargo claims for flights before the bankruptcy-law filing, should mail a claim form to the court by midnight Thursday, the department said. </TEXT></DOC>
