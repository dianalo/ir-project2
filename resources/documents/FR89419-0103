Relating to ``Definition of Agency Order in Connectionwith PACE.''</ITAG>Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (``Act''),15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 3, 1989, thePhiladelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.

The Commission is publishingthis notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interestedpersons. <ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under theAct, proposes to amend Exchange Rule 229, Supplementary Material .02, toread as follows (italics indicates new language): Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution System(``PACE'')Rule 229. No change.* * * Supplementary Material.01 No change. .02 Only agency orders may be executed under PACE. <T3>For purpose of the PACE System, an agency order is any order enteredon behalf of a public customer, and does not include any order enteredfor the account of a broker-dealer, the account of an associated personof a broker-dealer, or any account in which a broker-dealer or an associatedperson of a broker-dealer has any direct or indirect interest. </T3><ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C), below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statment of the Purpose of and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule Change PHLX Rule 229 relates to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communicationand Execution System, which provides for the automatic execution of orderson the Exchange equity floor under predetermined conditions. Pursuant toSupplementary Material .02 of Phlx Rule 229, only agency orders may beexecuted through PACE. This provision was intended to limit the availabilityof PACE to public customer orders. Because agency orders can be definedbroadly to include orders entered by broker-dealers or their affiliates,the amendment clarifies the original intent of the Rule. While the Exchangeis congnizant of the fact that PACE order entry firms may not know if acertain order is entered for the account of a broker-dealer or its affiliate,the Exchange would only require that order entry firms make a good faitheffort in routing public customer agency orders to PACE. The proposed rulechange is consistent with section 6(b) (5) of the Act in that it is designedto prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, will promotejust and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the publicinterest. Additionally, the proposal is consistent with section 11A(a)(1)(c)(iv)of the Act in that it promotes ``the practicability of brokers executing<T3>investors' </T3>orders in the best market.'' (Emphasis added)B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionThe Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose anyinappropriate burden on competition. C.
