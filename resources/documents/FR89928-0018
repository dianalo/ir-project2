S. Sargent (1895) from materialcollected in North Carolina, is a rhizomatous shrub. It is sometimes called``false poison sumac'' because of its superficial resemblance of <T3>Rhus vernix</T3>. The erect stems grow from 0.2 to 0.4 meter in height,and the entire plant is densely pubescent. The narrowly winged or winglessrachis supports 9 to 13 sessile, oblong to oblong-lanceolate leaflets thatare each 4 to 9 centimetes long, 2 to 5 centimeters wide, and acute toacuminate. The bases of the leaflets are rounded, and their edges are simplyor doubly serrate. Flowering in this dioecious species occurs in June.The small flowers are borne in a terminal, erect, dense cluster, with eachone being four- to five-parted and greenish-yellow to white. The fruit,which is a red, densely short-pubescent drupe, 5 to 6 millimeters broad,is borne on female plants from August to September (Radford <T3>et al.</T3> 1964, Cooper <T3>et al.</T3> 1977, Sargent 1895). <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> differs from other similar species of the genusby its short stature, dense overall pubescence, and evenly serrate leaflets.<T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is a species endemic to the inner coastal plainand lower piedmont of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, whereit is currently known from 15 locations in North Carolina and 1 locationin Georgia. The species occurs in sandy or rocky open woods, perhaps inassociation with basic soils (Cooper <T3>et al.</T3> 1977), and appears to be dependent upon some form of disturbanceto maintain the open quality of its habitat. Artificial disturbances, suchas railroad and highway right-of-way maintenance, are maintaining someof the openings historically provided by naturally occurring periodic fires.Thirty-two populations of <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> have been reported historically from 23 countiesin North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Sixteen of these populationsremain in existence in North Carolina and Georgia. The following is a summaryof the most current information for this species.<T3>Georgia:</T3> Five populations were reported historically in the Statefrom the counties of Cobb, Newton, Rabun, Columbia, and Elbert. Only theElbert County population is known to remain, with just four plants surviving.The site is on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, leased tothe Georgia Department of Natural Resources as part of the Board RiverWildlife Management Area (T. Patrick, Georgia Heritage Inventory, personalcommunication, 1988). The Newton County population is believed to havebeen destroyed during the construction of a water tower. Causes for thedisappearance of the populations in Rabun, Cobb, and Columbia Countiesare not known.<T3>South Carolina:</T3> Two populations were reported historically fromFlorence and Kershaw Counties. Although extensive searches have been conductedin these areas and other areas of potentially suitable habitat, the speciesis believed to have been extripated from the State.<T3>North Carolina: Rhus michauxii</T3> was once known to occur at 25 sitesin this State. The species has been extirpated at 10 of these localities,with the causes for extirpation being largely unknown. One population isbelieved to have been extirpated in each of the following counties. Orange,Wake, Wilson, Robeson, Moore, Lincoln, Franklin, Durham, Mechlenberg, andHoke. The distribution of the 15 extant populations by county is as follows.Three populations remain in Hoke County. One of these sites, with severalhundred female plants, is privately owned; another, with 23 plants, islocated on Ft. Bragg Military Reservation and is owned by the U.S. Departmentof Defense; and the third, a severely disturbed site where only four plantsremain, is partially in private ownership and partially owned by the NatureConservancy.Six populations occur in Richmond County. One of these (consisting of 2plants) is privately owned, and 4 (3 with less than 50 plants each andone with 137 plants) are located on land administered by the North CarolinaWildlife Resources Commission as part of the Sandhills Gamelands. The sixthpopulation, with only eight plants, is on Ft. Bragg Military Reservation,owed by the U.S. Department of Defense.Two populations occur in Scotland County on the Sandhills Gamelands, whichare administered by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Bothof these populations are large, with 1 covering an area of 76 meters by137 meters, but containing only female plants. The other consists of 300to 400 male plants.One population survives in each of the following counties: Franklin, Davie,Robeson, and Wake. The Franklin County population is privately owned andcontains over 250 plants of both sexes. The Davie County population, alsoin private ownership, consists of about 30 plants covering a 0.9-metersquare area. The Robeson County population, in private ownership, consistsof several hundred male plants. The Wake County population, owned by theCity of Raleigh, consists of 279 plants of both sexes.Many of these populations are in vulnerable locations, such as highwayrights-of-way or on the edges of plowed fields. Those that are not adjacentto some maintained opening or that are not exposed to periodic disturbanceare endagnered by natural succession.On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revised notice of reviewfor native plants, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480); <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> was included in that notice as a category 1 species.Category 1 species are those for which the Service presently has sufficientinformation on hand to support the biological appropriateness of theirbeing listed as endangered or threatened species. Subsequent revisionsof the 1980 notice have maintained <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> in cagegory 1.On January 6, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 441) a proposal to list <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> as an endangered species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the January 6, 1989, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices inviting public comment were published in the ``Athens News'' (Athens,Georgia) on January 28, 1989, in the ``Fayetteville Times'' (Fayetteville,North Carolina) on January 28, 1989, and in the ``Raleigh News and Observer''(Raleigh, North Carolina) on January 29, 1989.Eleven comments were received. Of these, seven respondents expressed supportfor the proposal, including the Natural Heritage Program of the North CarolinaDepartment of Natural Resources and Community Development, the Plant ConservationProgram of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, the Georgia andSouth Carolina State offices of The Nature Conservancy, the Corps of Engineers(Wilmington District), the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, andthe World Conservation Monitoring Centre. The remaining four comments offeredadditional information but stated no position on the proposal. All of thenew information supplied by these 11 comments has been incorporated intoappropriate sections of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> should be classified as an endangered species.Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> Sargent (Michaux's sumac) are as follows:A. <T3>The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or Range</T3><T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> has been and continues to be endangered by destructionor adverse alteration of its habitat. Since discovery of the species, 50percent of the known populations have been extirpated, partly as a resultof conversion of habitat for silvicultural and agricultural purposes andfor industrial and residential development. Fire suppression appears tobe a problem for this species and will be discussed in detail under FactorE below. Of the 16 populations that have been extirpated, 1 is known tohave been eliminated by industrial development and 1 by conversion of thesite to pine plantation. Causes for extirpation of the others are unknown.Many of the remaining populations are on the edges of highway or railroadrights-of-way or cultivated fields. Fourteen of the 16 remaining populationsare currently threatened by habitat alteration.In addition to the major threats listed above, those populations on militaryland are potentially threatened by mechanized military training activities.Although this has not been a documented problem for this species thus far,some of the small sites occupied by the species could easily be destroyedby heavy, tracked vehicles such as tanks. Nontheless, populations probablypersist on military lands and State gamelands where they have not survivedon adjacent privately owned land because of the prescribed burning programsof the Defense Department and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission,and periodic fires incidental to military training (J. Carter, North CarolinaState University, personal communication, 1987; J. Moore, North CarolinaNatural Heritage Program, personal communication, 1987). Activities associatedwith intensive timber management on publicly owned land, such as timberharvesting, road building, and conversion of habitat to pine plantation,if done in a manner not consistent with the protection of <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> populations, could adversely affect the species,as has been the case on private lands in the past.B. <T3>Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes </T3><T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is not currently a significant component of thecommercial trade in native plants. However, because of its small and easilyaccessible populations, it is vulnerable to taking and vandalism that couldresult from increased publicity. C. Disease or Predation. Not applicable to this species at this time.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms<T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>is afforded legal protection in North Carolinaby North Carolina General Statutes, andSection; 106-202.12 to 106-202.19(Cum. Supp. 1985), which provide for protection from intrastate trade (withouta permit) and for monitoring and management of State-listed species, andwhich prohibit taking of plants without written permission of landowners.<T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is listed in North Carolina as endangered and ofspecial concern (Sutter <T3>et al.</T3> 1983). The species is recognized in South Carolina as extirpatedin the State and of national concern by the South Carolina Advisory Committeeon Rare, threatened, and Endangered Plants in South Carolina; however,this State offers no official protection. The species is not listed bythe State of Georgia where it was thought to have been extirpated untilvery recently. State prohibitions against taking are difficult to enforceand do not cover adverse alterations of habitats, such as exclusion offire. The Endangered Species Act would provide additional protection andencouragement of active management for <T3>Rhus michauxii.</T3>E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued ExistenceAs mentioned in the ``Background'' section of this rule, many of the remainingpopulations are small in numbers of individual stems and in area coveredby the plants. Of the 16 remaining populations, 9 have less than 100 plants,with 3 of these containing less than a dozen plants each. The rhizomatousnature of the species indicates that there are many fewer individual plantsin existence than stem counts would indicate. In addition, only two ofthe remaining populations contain both male and female plants. The dioeciousnature of the species further increases the vulnerability of extremelysmall populations where plants of only one sex remain. Existing conditionsat most of the occupied sites are indicative of low genetic variabilitywithin populations, which makes it more important to maintain as much habitatand as many of the remaining colonies, particularly those containing bothsexes, as possible. The North Carolina Natural Heritage Program's responseto the proposed rule stated that, because of the clonal nature of thisspecies and the scarcity of populations containing both male and femaleplants, the remaining ``populations'' may actually consist of only abouttwo dozen genetic individuals; ``considering the profound threats to itshabitat and that the total remaining population of Michaux's sumac is almostcertainly below fifty, a stronger case for Federal listing can hardly bemade.'' The North Carolina Plant Conservation Program's response echoedthis assessment of the species' status and stated further that <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is one of the ``* * * most endangered species inNorth Carolina * * *'' and ``* * * is severely threatened by suppressionof fire, development, and geographic isolation of single sex populations.''Another potential threat to this species, particularly in populations whereonly a few plants remain, is hybridization with sympatric species suchas <T3>Rhus glabra</T3> and <T3>Rhus copallina.</T3> Hardin and Phillips (1985) documented the existenceof an intermediate form between <T3>Rhus glabra </T3>and <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>in at least two sites from which <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>had been reported. Much remains unknown about thedemographics and reproductive requirements of this species. Fire or someother suitable form of distrubance, such as mowing or careful clearing,appears to be essential for maintaining the open habitat preferred by <T3>Rhus michauxii. </T3>Without such periodic disturbance, this type ofhabitat is gradually overtaken and eliminated by the shrubs and trees ofthe adjacent woodlands. As the woody species increase in height and density,they overtop the <T3>Rhus michauxii, </T3>which is shade-intolerant. The current distributionof the species is ample evidence of its dependence on disturbance. Of the16 remaining populations, 11 are on roadsides or in the edges of artificallymaintained clearings. Two others are in areas that have been exposed toperiodic fire, another is in a natural opening on the rim of a Carolinabay (shallow, elliptical depression of unknown origin); the remaining twoare in wooded sites and are declining in vigor (J. Moore, personal communication,1988; T. Patrick, personal communication, 1988).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Rhus michauxii </T3>as endangered. With half of the species' populationsalready having been eliminated and only 16 remaining in existence (withmost of these being very small in size and containing plants of only onesex), and based upon its dependence on some form of active management,it warrants protection under the Act. Endangered status seems appropriatebecause of the imminent serious threats facing most populations. As statedby Hardin and Phillips (1985), ``<T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is apparently on the verge of extinction * * *.''Critical habitat is not being designated for the reasons discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timea species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service findsthat designation of critical habitat is not prudent for <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> at this time. As discussed under Factor B in the``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section, <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is vulnerable to taking, an activity difficultto enforce against and only regulated by the Act with respect to plantsin cases of (1) removal and reduction to possession, of listed plants fromlands under Federal jurisdiction, or their malicious damage or destructionon such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroyingin knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminaltrespass law. Such provisions are difficult to enforce, and publicationof critical habitual descriptions and maps would make <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> more vulnerable and would increase enforcementproblems. All involved parties and principal landowners have been notifiedof the locations and importance of protecting this species. Protectionof this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery processand through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not beprudent to determine critical habitat for <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery recoveryactions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions againstcertain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results inconservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, andindividuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisitionand cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carriedout for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service followinglisting. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to any critical habitat. Regulationsimplementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codifiedat 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensurethat activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modifyits critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species orits critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formalconsultation with the Service.The U.S. Department of Defense has jurisdiction over portions of this species'habitat. Federal activities on these and other Federal and private landsthat could impact <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> and its habitat in the future include, but arenot limited to, the following: silvicultural activities, including timberharvesting and conversion of sites to pine plantations by means of mechanicalsite preparation; mechanized military training operations; recreationaldevelopment; power line construction and certain types of maintenance/improvements;highway construction and certain types of maintenance/improvements; andpermits for mineral exploration and mining. The Service will work withthe involved agencies to secure protection and proper management of <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> while accommodating agency activities to the extentpossible.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. With respect to <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3>, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of theAct, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part, makeit illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United Statesto import or export the species, transport it in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of commercial activity, sell or offer it for salein interstate or foreign commerce, or remove and reduce the species topossession from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, the 1988amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage ordestruction of listed plants on Federal lands, and the removal, cutting,digging up, or damaging or destroying of these plants in knowing violationof any State law or regulation, including State criminal tresspass law.Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangeredspecies under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permitswould ever be sought or issued, since <T3>Rhus michauxii</T3> is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, Virginia 22203 (703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cooper, J., S.
