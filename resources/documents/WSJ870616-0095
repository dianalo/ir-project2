And though they, and the Bangkok government, are fighting back, they admit their ability to stem the plastic crime wave is limited.    American Express Co., the local market leader, says the company's fraud losses in Thailand were second only to those in the U.S. last year. &quot;This isn't an amateur business now, and that's why 1986 was a big loss for all card issuers,&quot; says Anastase Raftopoulos, general manager of American Express (Thai) Co.    The swindlers are particularly active in the northern tourist town of Chiang Mai. Travelers use Chiang Mai as a base for week-long treks in the surrounding mountains, and often leave their valuables with guesthouses for safekeeping. Unscrupulous guesthouse owners can then use the guest's cards to run up bills that usually aren't noticed until the tourist returns home, the card companies say.    &quot;Sometimes our laws are obsolete,&quot; says Gen. Pow Sarasin, deputy director-general of the Royal Thai Police Force. &quot;There weren't any credit cards in Thailand when the laws were written.&quot;    Even if suspected crooks are caught, prosecution isn't easy. &quot;There's a legal system which isn't protecting us, and the police force isn't trained to deal with commercial crime,&quot; says Mr. Raftopoulos of American Express. Gen. Pow adds that few foreigners are willing to return to Thailand to testify against suspects.    Evaluating the fraud isn't easy because the card companies don't share market information. But American Express estimates that crooked transactions in Thailand in 1986 cost companies about $20 million, or almost 7% of $280 million in credit-card billings. Gen. Pow reckons that American Express was hit hardest by Thai card crooks, with an estimated $4 million in losses.    Since September, American Express has scrapped agreements with more than 600 merchants, or about 17% of its active total, because of high occurrences of fraud. But while tighter company controls help reduce swindles, companies say some problems appear intractable. &quot;Our systems just don't work for much of the fraud that's occurring in Thailand,&quot; says John Miller, Visa International's Tokyo-based security representative for Asia. </TEXT></DOC>
