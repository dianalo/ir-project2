It said the blindfolded hostages were taken last Saturday to thehouse of Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin, the spokesman for Hezbollah, orParty of God, believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers.   Hezbollah is battling the Amal militia of Justice Minister NabihBerri for control of south Beirut's slums, where many of the 18foreign hostages were believed to be held.   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut-based weekly, said the hostages were movedto al-Amin's house in a relatively safer south Beirut area, but didnot name the neighborhood where the house is located.   Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidal-Amin's house is in Manshieh Street in the Harek Hreik slum about50 yards from the residence of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah.   The weekly, which was the first to report the secret U.S. armssales to Iran in November 1986, did not say where in south Beirutthe hostages were imprisoned before they were moved.   It said the hostages were blindfolded when they were taken toal-Amin's house in several civlian cars with a heavy militia escort.   The magazine cited no sources and the report could not beindependently verified. Al-Amin was not available for comment.Hezbollah's press office in south Beirut's district of Bir el-Abeddid not answer telephone calls.   Ash-Shiraa has good sources in the Iranian government and amongthe Shiite community in Lebanon, but many of its recent reports onforeign hostages have not panned out.   Nine Americans are among the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Thelongest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
