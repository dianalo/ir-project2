This provision was added to the Codeby section 7602 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, 102Stat. 4181, 4507-08 (1988)). The temporary regulations added by this documentwill remain in effect until superseded by later temporary or final regulationsrelating to these matters or until expiration of 3 years from the dateof issuance, whichever occurs first.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Section 7624 gives the Internal Revenue Service discretion to reimbursea State or local law enforcement agency for expenses incurred in an investigationwhere resulting information furnished by the agency to the Service substantiallycontributes to the recovery of Federal taxes with respect to illegal drugor related money laundering activities. The temporary regulations providethat the reimbursement allowable under this provision is limited to 10percent of the amount recovered for Federal taxes, including additionsto tax, and civil penalties, but not interest or criminal fines. However,no reimbursement is allowable with respect to expenses that have been orwill be reimbursed from other sources, such as a Federal or State forfeitureprogram. The temporary regulations also provide that reimbursement willnot be paid unless the amount of taxes recovered is at least $50,000. Thissection applies to State law enforcement agencies including the Districtof Columbia, and local law enforcement agencies within the states and theDistrict of Columbia.Whether or not information furnished by a State or local law enforcementagency substantially contributes to the recovery of taxes is necessarilya determination based on facts and circumstances that can be made by theService only on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, the temporary regulationsexplain the type of information that the Service will consider as having``substantially contributed'' to the collection of additional Federal taxeswith respect to illegal drug or related money laundering activities. Theserules are intended to provide guidance to law enforcement agencies as tothe types of information that the Service generally finds highly usefulin developing and prosecuting a Federal tax case involving illegal drugor related money laundering activities.Thus, as provided in these temporary regulations, where information providedby a State or local law enforcement agency substantially contributes tothe collection of at least $50,000 in additional taxes, additions to taxand civil penalties with respect to illegal drug or related money launderingactivities, the Service may provide reimbursement for reasonable investigativeexpenses, not otherwise reimbursed, up to a maximum of 10 percent of thetaxes recovered. A special account has been established for this purposeto receive and expend funds.A State or loca1 law enforcement agency furnishing information to the Servicemust use Form 211A to apply for reimbursement under this section. An applicationfor reimbursement may be filed with the Service as soon as the agency hasmade a final determination as to the amount of the expenses incurred andthe amount received or to be received from other sources. However, no applicationwill be considered by the Service if filed later than 30 days after theService has notified the agency of the amount of taxes recovered. If morethan one agency files an application for reimbursement with respect tothe taxes recovered, the Service will use discretion in allocating theamount of reimbursement to be paid to each agency, but in no event shallthe aggregate of amounts paid by the Service exceed 10 percent of the sumof additional Federal taxes recovered.Section 7809(d) of the Code provides that reimbursement under section 7624must be paid out of the amounts recovered as a result of information furnishedby the State or local law enforcement agency which substantially contributedto the recovery. Congress did not provide for any separate appropriationof Federal funds for this purpose. For this reason, the Service must insureagainst the possibility of having to refund to the taxpayer amounts collectedafter these amounts have already been paid to a State or local law enforcementagency as reimbursement. Accordingly, the temporary regulations providethat no reimbursement will be paid before expiration of the period of limitationsfor filing a claim for refund by the taxpayer or the determination of thetaxpayer's liability becomes final. In general, no refund is allowableunless a claim for refund is filed by a taxpayer within 3 years from thetime the return is filed or 2 years from the time the tax is paid, whicheveris later. However, in many instances this period for filing a claim forrefund will be extended. For example, if a taxpayer enters into an agreementto extend the period of limitations on assessment of tax, the period oflimitations on filing a claim for refund is extended for 6 months afterexpiration of the period of limitations on assessment. Thus, in most cases,the payment of reimbursement under section 7624 would be delayed for aminimum of two years after the information is provided to the Service (i.e.,the minimum period within which a refund may be claimed) and in many casesthe delay could be much longer. However, an agency that adequately indemnifiesthe Service against loss due to a refund to the taxpayer of Federal taxescollected may receive reimbursement at an earlier time. These rules apply to information first provided by a State or local lawenforcement agency after February 16, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>These rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore,a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. The rules contained in this document are also being issued as proposedregulations by the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in theproposed rules section of this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.

Winkler of the Officeof Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting), Internal RevenueService. However, other personnel from the Internal Revenue Service andthe Treasury Department participated in their development. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects 26 CFR Part 301 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Bankruptcy, Courts, Crime, Disclosureof information, Employment taxes, Estate tax, Excise taxes, Filing requirements,Gift tax, Income taxes, Investigations, Law enforcement, Penalties, Pensions,Statistics, Taxes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations </ITAG>Accordingly, 26 CFR Part 301 is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION </ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 301 is amended by adding thefollowing citation:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>26 U.S.C. 7805. * * * Section 301.7624-1T also issuedunder 26 U.S.C. 7624.</ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>The following new andSection; 301.7624-1T shall be addedin the appropriate place. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.7624-1T </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reimbursement to State and local law enforcement agencies (temporary).</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>The Internal Revenue Service may reimburse a Stateor local law enforcement agency for expenses, such as salaries, overtimepay, per diem, and similar reasonable expenses, incurred in an investigationin which information is furnished to the Service that substantially contributesto the recovery of Federal taxes imposed with respect to illegal drug orrelated money laundering activities. The amount of reimbursement that maybe paid shall not exceed the limits specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and(e)(3) of this section. (b) <T3>Information that substantially contributes to recovery of taxes_</T3>(1)<T3>Definition. </T3>The Service generally will consider that informationfurnished by a State or local law enforcement agency substantially contributedto the recovery of taxes with respect to illegal drug or related moneylaundering activities provided the information was not already in the possessionof the Service at the time the information is furnished by the State orlocal law enforcement agency, and (i) Concerns a taxpayer who is not under examination or investigation bythe Service at the time the information is furnished or has not alreadybeen selected by the Service for examination or investigation in the nearfuture, or (ii) Concerns a taxpayer who is under examination or has been selectedfor examination at the time the information is furnished but the informationfurnished would not normally have been discovered in the course of an ordinaryinvestigation or examination by the Service. Also, information will generallybe considered as substantially contributing to the recovery of taxes ifit leads to the discovery of hidden assets owned by the taxpayer whichare used to satisfy the taxpayer's assessed but otherwise uncollectableFederal tax liability with respect to illegal drug or related money launderingactivities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of this paragraph, information includes, but is not limitedto, tax years of violations, aliases, addresses, social security numbersand/or employer identification numbers, financial data (bank accounts,assets, etc.) and their location, and any documentation that substantiatesallegations concerning tax liability (books and records) and its location.(2) Examples.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A local police department's narcotics division hasbeen gathering information on a suspected local drug dealer for approximatelysix months. Because this person is very cautious when handling narcotics,the local police have been unsuccessful in catching this person in possessionof drugs. Rather than drop the case, the narcotics detective turns overto the local IRS Criminal Investigation Division (CID) office informationconcerning this person. At the time the information is furnished, the Serviceis unaware of this person's suspected involvement in drugs and has no reasonto suspect that this person's Federal income tax returns are incorrect.Upon examination of this person's returns for three open years, the Servicedetermines that additional Federal income taxes and civil penalties ofapproximately $20,000 per year are due because of unreported income fromdrug dealing. Because the taxpayer was not under examination and was notreasonably anticipated to have been examined prior to receipt of the information,the Service will consider that the information furnished by the local policedepartment substantially contributed to the recovery of approximately $60,000in taxes with respect to illegal drug activities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Assume the same facts as example (1) except thatat the time the information is turned over to the Service, the Servicewas already aware of the extent of this person's involvement in drug dealing,either through information developed in the course of examinations of othertaxpayers or through information received from other sources, and had alreadyselected this person's returns for examination although the person hadnot yet been contacted by the Service. In this case, the information providedby the local police department did not substantially contribute to therecovery of taxes from this person because the information was alreadyknown to the Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>A state or local police officer is conducting ordinarytraffic patrol. The officer stops a vehicle for speeding and reckless driving.The officer recognizes the driver as a known narcotics dealer. In the vehicleis a brief case containing $75,000 in cash, but no trace of narcotics isfound. The driver claims the cash was won in a high stakes poker game.The officer arrests the driver for traffic violations and takes the briefcaseinto custody for safe keeping. The local police department cannot seizethe money because they cannot tie it to a narcotics transaction. Instead,they immediately inform the local CID office of their find. At the timethis information is furnished to the Service, there is an unpaid assessedliability of $300,000 in Federal taxes and penalties owed by the dealerwith respect to illegal drug activities that the Service has been unableto collect. Therefore, the Service immediately seizes the $75,000 in cashin partial payment of the tax liability. The Service will consider thatthe information furnished by the police department substantially contributedto the recovery of $75,000 in taxes with respect to drug related activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>Through information furnished by a reliable informant,a local police department learns that a known racketeer and suspected drugdealer maintains a second set of books and records in a safe at home. Thelocal police obtain a search warrant and find a set of books revealingthat this person has been using a legitimate business operation to laundermoney derived from both prostitution and drug dealing. At the time theserecords are turned over to the local CID office, the taxpayer is alreadyunder examination for tax evasion. However, based on the information containedin this second set of books, the Service is able to collect additionaltaxes and civil penalties in the amount of $1 million in connection withthese illegal activities. The Service will consider that this informationsubstantially contributed to the recovery of $1 million in taxes with respectto money laundering in connection with illegal drug activities because,even though the taxpayer was already under examination, the informationprovided by the local police would normally not have been discovered bythe Service in the course of an ordinary investigation.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Application for reimbursement. </T3>An agency that intends to applyfor reimbursement under the provisions of this section must indicate thisintent to the Service at the time the information is first provided tothe Service. A final application for reimbursement of expenses must besubmitted on Form 211A, State or Local Law Enforcement Application forReimbursement, to the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division of the InternalRevenue Service district in which the taxpayer is located. Copies of Forms9061, DAG-71, or other claim for an equitable share of asset forfeituresin the case must also be furnished with Form 211A. (d) <T3>Time for filing application for reimbursement. </T3>An applicationfor reimbursement may be filed by an agency at the time the informationis first provided or as soon as practicable after submitting informationto the Service. However, it must be filed not later than 30 days afterthe Service notifies the agency pursuant to section 7624(b) of the amountof taxes collected as a result of the information provided. If an applicationfor reimbursement is filed by more than one agency with respect to taxesrecovered from a taxpayer, the Service will use discretion in determiningan equitable amount of reimbursement allocated to each agency based onall relevant factors. In no event, however, shall the aggregate of theamounts paid by the Service to two or more agencies exceed the amount specifiedin paragraph (e)(3) of this section.(e)<T3> Amount and payment of reimbursement_</T3>(1)<T3> De minimis rule.</T3> No reimbursement shall be paid under section7624 or this section to a State or local law enforcement agency in anycase where the taxes recovered total less than $50,000.(2)<T3> Taxes recovered.</T3> For purposes of section 7624 and this section,the terms ``taxes'' recovered and ``sum'' recovered mean additional Federaltaxes, civil penalties, and additions to tax collected (less any subsequentrefund to the taxpayer) with respect to illegal drug or related money launderingactivities, but not additional interest or criminal fines that may be collected.(3)<T3> Limitation on reimbursement.</T3> The amount of reimbursement payableunder section 7624 and this section shall not exceed 10 percent of anytaxes recovered.(4)<T3> No duplicate reimbursement.</T3> A State or local law emforcementagency shall not receive reimbursement under section 7624 or this sectionfor any expenses incurred in the investigation of a taxpayer which havebeen or will be reimbursed under any other program or arrangement including,but not limited to, Federal or State forfeiture programs, State revenuelaws, or Federal and State equitable sharing arrangements.(5)<T3> Time of payment.</T3> No payment of any reimbursement under this sectionwill be made to a State or local law enforcement agency before the laterof final expiration of the applicable period of limitations for filinga claim for refund by the taxpayer of the taxes recovered as provided insubchapter B of chapter 66 of the Code or the determination of the taxpayer'stax liability, as defined in section 1313(a). However, reimbursement maybe made earlier but only if the agency provides adequate indemnificationagainst loss by the Service due to a refund to the taxpayer of Federaltaxes recovered.(6)<T3> Applicability.</T3> The provisions of section 7624 apply only to Stateand local law enforcement agencies within the United States and the Districtof Columbia.(f)<T3> Effective date.</T3> This section 7624 applies with respect to informationfirst provided to the Service by a State or local law enforcement agencyafter February 16, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
