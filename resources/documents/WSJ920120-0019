Mr. Kahn added in an interview that in the current year,&quot;we'd be very disappointed if we didn't continue with a veryrapid growth rate.&quot; He said he was satisfied with analysts'estimates that 1992 earnings and revenue will rise about 35%for the software concern.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kahn endorsed what he called the high end of analysts'estimates of fourth-quarter net income of $1.4 million, or 25cents a share, up 75% from year-earlier operating earnings of$800,475, or 15 cents a share, before a tax-losscarry-forward. In the year-ago quarter, a tax credit of$259,000 brought net income to $1.1 million, or 20 cents ashare. Easel had used up its tax credits by the beginning ofthe latest fourth quarter.   The upper end of analysts' revenue estimates for thequarter is $9.1 million, up from year-earlier fourth-quarterrevenue of $5.3 million.   Easel makes $12,000 software tools used by corporatecomputer programmers to design easy-to-use graphical screensfor computer users and $350 programs that let those screensrun on users' personal computers. It has been one of thefastest-growing software makers in the past two years and hasbecome a stock market favorite, more than quintupling inprice since its $8-a-share initial public offering in August1990.   The fourth-quarter gains will make 1991 earnings beforetax credits nearly $3.9 million, or 69 cents a share, up 77%from the $2.2 million, or 45 cents a share, in earningsbefore the tax credit in 1990. In 1991 Easel had tax creditsof $480,000, or nine cents a share, compared withyear-earlier tax credits of $875,000, or 18 cents a share.The tax credits lifted net income to nearly $4.4 million, or78 cents a share, up from about $3 million, or 63 cents ashare.   The fourth-quarter gains made revenue for the year about$28 million, up 61% from $17.3 million.   Mr. Kahn said, &quot;there's been enormous demand for graphicalapplications and we've been able to capitalize.&quot; Easel'ssoftware tools can be used to design the graphical userinterface for both new corporate programs and to renovateolder systems by making it easier for users to getinformation from data bases.   Mr. Kahn said one client designed a new interface for itshuman resources programs that lets employees use a personalcomputer to inquire about the status of their benefits,retirement plans, vacation days and other information byhitting a few keys or using a computer pointing device calleda mouse. Previously, only experienced personnel departmentworkers knew the computer codes needed to get suchinformation.   He said an insurance company used Easel's software todesign a new client-server application that lets employeesquickly see on their screens a variety of customerinformation about billing and coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
