President Reagan's national security adviser has just told them they should support U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. But a small group of U.S. congressmen will be on the scene to tell them they should not.    If any of the Central American presidents have read the U.S. Constitution they will know that congressmen are not empowered to conduct foreign policy. This present Congress has developed a habit of neglecting its own constitutional responsibilities -- the federal budget, for example -- while interfering in those granted to the executive branch. Worse than that, the congressmen journeying to San Jose under the leadership of Rep. David Bonior of Michigan will be lobbying on behalf of a regime in Managua that does not even have the support of its own people.    It's a lot to ask foreign heads of state to understand behavior we don't understand ourselves. But we hope the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala will find a nice anteroom somewhere to park this illicit delegation while the presidents hold a serious discussion. A good starting point would be the message from Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President Reagan's national security adviser. General Powell, who really is empowered to represent U.S. foreign policy, asked the presidents to denounce Nicaragua's Sandinista regime.    Clearly, the Latin presidents are aware of their predicament. Their countries, and particularly El Salvador, have been fighting Fidel Castro's efforts to undermine them for years. But given the weakness of their position, attributable in part to the Sandinistas' growing fleet of tanks and gunships and in part to U.S. political disarray, they have attempted to come to terms with Managua. Yet surely it must be clear by now that the Sandinistas are only dissembling to buy time for a further military buildup.    As it happens, however, the Sandinistas themselves have serious problems. A crowd variously estimated at 10,000 to 20,000 (out of a city population of only some 260,000) turned out in Managua Sunday to protest Sandinista militarism and repression. The rally, which received almost no attention in the U.S. press, featured banners showing Nicaraguans breaking in half the AK-47 rifles the Russians have sent them to kill other Nicaraguans on the counter-revolutionary or &quot;Contra&quot; side. The war is not popular and the Sandinistas are not winning it.    Cardinal Obando y Bravo, leader of the Roman Catholic Church, is stronger than ever. Reports from the scene tell us that the communists can no longer organize &quot;divine mobs&quot; to harass the church and other enemies. La Prensa is defying the government once more. Inflation is estimated at 2,000%. Without the black market, Nicaraguans would not have basic necessities.    This doesn't mean the Sandinistas are about to fall. Communist regimes elsewhere have survived for years without popular support by the simple expedient of maintaining party and army loyalty. Nicaragua's jails remain full of political prisoners. Managua remains the command center for communist insurgencies in El Salvador and elsewhere throughout Central America.    Only the Contras have guns of their own. General Powell was saying to the four presidents that support for this one source of real pressure on the Sandinistas is the only way to protect their own futures. He might have added that if that future turns dark, they'll still be in Central America but Congressman Bonior will be safe back home in Washington.    General Powell isn't the only one with that message. Costa Rica's president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, won a Nobel Prize for his efforts to appease the Sandinistas, but his own political party, Liberacion, is growing restive under his subtle leadership. His appointee as president of the General Assembly, for example, recently came out publicly for support of the Contras.    Congress will vote Feb. 3 on Mr. Reagan's request for Contra aid. The four presidents could influence that vote with the statement they issue after this weekend's meeting. It is ironic that the voices of the leaders of these little countries may be necessary to persuade the legislative body of the world's most powerful democracy to support democracy. But that's the way it is. </TEXT></DOC>
