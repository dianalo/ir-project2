Paced by a surge in energy prices, the Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6% in January, the biggest rise since an increase of the same size in November 1985. Last month's increase follows a revised 0.1% decline in December; the department originally said prices were unchanged that month.    Energy prices jumped 9.9%, the sharpest rise since a 10.1% increase in February 1974, after declining 0.9% in December. Excluding energy, prices fell 0.3% in January and were unchanged in December.    Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said that the output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities increased a healthy 0.4% in January after rising a revised 0.3% in December. The latest rise was the fourth in a row after months of sluggishness. Previously, the Fed said industrial production increased 0.5% in December.    In a third report, the Commerce Department said business inventories fell 0.5% in December after a 0.3% drop in November. The December drop was the biggest since a 0.6% decline in March 1983.    The producer prices report shows that &quot;energy inflation is cropping up,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. But he and other analysts said the rise in energy prices is a temporary effect of the increase in spot-market oil prices late last year that didn't show up in the December index. The boost will be reflected in the index only for the next month or so, they said.    &quot;We can expect the producer price index and the consumer price index to be high for a couple of months and then come down in the spring after the temporary impact of oil prices has worked its way through,&quot; said Mickey Levy, chief economist at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia.    Last year, producer prices fell 2.5%, reflecting the plunge in energy prices. It was the first annual decline since a 0.2% drop in 1963.    Several economists pointed to a 0.4% increase in January prices excluding food and energy, suggesting that it indicated some acceleration in the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. That increase followed a 0.1% rise in December. Analysts generally expect prices to pick up this year in response to the decline of the dollar in foreign-exchange trading. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive, giving domestic manufacturers more room to raise prices.    Food prices fell 1.8% in January after a 0.4% drop in December. Many analysts expect food prices to turn up in coming months. Prices for capital equipment rose 0.2% last month after a 0.1% rise in December.    The department's index for intermediate goods rose 0.9% after remaining unchanged in December. Prices for crude goods increased 2.9% after a 1.4% drop.    The figures in all three reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before seasonal adjustment, producer prices in January rose 0.6% to 291.7% of its 1967 average and stood 1.5% below a year earlier.    On production, the Fed said the rise reflected moderate gains in most areas with a strong 0.7% gain in the production of nondurable consumer items. Output of such items, which are designed to last less than three years, rose 0.8% in December. Consumer durables rose 0.2% after a 2.8% increase.    The Fed said home appliances declined after a strong showing in December. Auto production also fell, but the declines were offset by increases in the output of trucks and home goods other than appliances, it said.    The output of business equipment rose 0.4% after a 0.4% drop.    &quot;January is off to a decent start,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. The rise in production &quot;is a good healthy number.&quot; He added, however, that improvement in the U.S. trade balance hasn't been enough to produce a strong economy in the first half of the year.    Output by manufacturers was up 0.6% last month after a 0.5% gain in December. Mining output, which includes the troubled oil and gas extraction industry, increased 0.2% after a 1.3% decline. Utilities production fell 0.1% after being unchanged. The output of materials rose 0.2% after increasing 0.1%.    The Fed's industrial production index stood at 126.9% of its 1977 average and was 0.6% above a year earlier.    In the inventories report, the Commerce Department said the decline in December left the inventories to sales ratio at 1.31, down from 1.35 in November. Sales rose 2.9% in December after being unchanged in November.    Mr. Levy predicted that inventories will be built up in coming months as business confidence grows. Mr. Jasinowski suggested that companies may start to build stocks in anticipation of price increases.    In December, retail inventories posted the biggest drop, falling 1.2% after a 0.9% decline in November. Inventories of wholesalers were down 0.2% after a 0.3% drop. Manufacturers' stocks fell 0.2% after a 0.1% rise.    Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on business inventories and sales in December.
