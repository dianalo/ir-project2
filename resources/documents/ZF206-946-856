(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Karyl ScottandM;The Securities Industry Association's recent decision to develop afiber-optic backbone network signals a growing trend among industry tradegroups seeking to share the costs and benefits of wide area networks.andM;The SIA recently awarded a contract, estimated to be worth $35 million, toNew York Telephone Co. to design, install and manage the private fibernetwork, which will serve the voice- and data-communications needs of 16 ofthe SIA's largest members in Manhattan.andM;The SIA joins groups such as the Mortgage Bankers Association, the AmericanPublishers Association and the Aerospace Industries Association, which havebanded together to create shared networks.andM;The advantages of joint ventures, observers say, include economies of scalethat could not be realized by a single company alone and the ability tocapitalize on some leading-edge technologies that could not be justified byone company and a relatively small network.andP;  These networks also provide amuch-needed means for companies that share common interests to interactelectronically.andM;The network, for example, will allow SIA securities traders at 16 of thenation's largest brokerage firms in New York to communicate with theircorresponding trading partners at other firms in the SIA, said H. PimGoodbody, vice president of marketing at the New York-based SIA.andM;''The benefits we expect to achieve through this joint network project wouldnot be attainable by any firm acting alone.andP;  These brokerage firms are highlycompetitive companies, but they realize they have a need to communicate amongthemselves in order to do their jobs.andM;''By creating a private network linking these various brokerage houses, themember companies will be able to realize a 35-percent cost savings comparedto the telephone services they now use,'' Goodbody said.andP;  That comes to about$3 million annually.andM;In addition to cutting costs, the SIA's fiber-optic network will provide highbandwidth (64K-bps to 45M-bps transmission rates) to users whosecommunications needs are continually increasing.andP;  Users will also be able tocustomize the service, said William McGruther, managing director of customnetwork design services at New York Telephone.andM;The four-node network will be connected by T-1 and T-3 fiber links, and the500 end-user locations will be linked with T-1 and 64K-bps circuits,McGruther said.andP;  Initially, the project will provide voice-communicationsservices; subsequent phases will provide data-communications capabilitiesincluding X.25 packet switching, support for TCP/IP and integrated servicesdigital networks (ISDN), said Goodbody.andM;SIA is taking a tack similar to that of the Mortgage Bankers Association(MBA), whose 4-year-old Echo network provides members and other banks withelectronic messaging, database access and limited transaction processingusing Telenet Communications Corp.'s public packet-switched network, saidTeresa Bowker, major accounts manager at the Mortgage Bankers Service Corp.andO;(MBSC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the MBA that is responsible for Echo.andM;From a PC with customized Echo software, users can, for example, accessinformation on mortgage rates in the MBA's database and information onhousing regulations from host computers at the U.S.andP;  Department of Housingand Urban Development, explained Warren Dunn, general manager of Echo atMBSC, based in Washington.andM;Faster Book OrdersandM;The Association of American Publishers (AAP) will soon bring its so-calledPubnet on line, according to AAP officials.andP;  Pubnet, which will be installedwith the aid of General Electric Information Services Corp., will allowbookstores to order from 45 major publishers through the use of PCs over GE'spublic packet-switched network, according to Parker Ladd, managing directorof Pubnet.andP;  Book availability and pricing will be updated daily in the AAPdatabase, and the network should help buyers and sellers expedite orderprocessing, said Ladd.andM;The Aerospace Industry Association, in concert with Telenet, recentlyinitiated an electronic-mail network that allows the aerospace giants toexchange messages on manufacturing projects in which the various participantsshare a common interest, according to the firms involved.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
