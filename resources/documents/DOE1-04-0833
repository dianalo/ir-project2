An example of such a structure is aplane current layer in a homogeneous magnetic field. In the presenceof sources that restore in the layer the shear of the magnetic fieldlines (and, accordingly, the current) the dissipation process may beauto-oscillatory. The magnetic field of an active region containing forcelesscurrent layers can be regarded as an excitable nonlinear medium in whichautowave propagation is possible. The energy and time characteristicsof collapsing current layers are close to those of flares.</TEXT></DOC>
