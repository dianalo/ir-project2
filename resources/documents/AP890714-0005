Rodrigo Imas, a 30-year-old print shop employee, said hisgrandfather told him many times about the four-week trip he madefrom Italy in the hold of a freighter to start a new life inArgentina.   ``Now I'm hoping to find enough money to buy a one-way ticket onAerolineas Argentinas,'' Imas said. ``The transportation has changedand the direction is reversed, but the idea is the same.''   As inflation and interest rates have soared out of control andthe austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just fivemonths ago, businesses have closed by the score and thousands ofworkers have been laid off.   Argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs havewatched in dismay as food, gasoline, cigarettes, movie tickets andvirtually everything else have shot up in price, while wages in realterms have shrunk.   Argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons. A decadeago, it was to escape the violence of left-wing subversion followedby a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in March, 1976.   For the past several years, Argentines have left in search ofeconomic opportunity, however, and visa applications haveaccelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months.   With the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar, a teacherwho earned $100 a month at the end of 1988 would have been earning alittle as $40 at the end of June; a newspaper reporter who earned$300 now earns $90; a bilingual marketing administrator could wellhave seen his pay fall from $300 to $135 and a bank economist from$700 to $300. Some of those employers have taken their own measuresto offset inflation.   ``A lot of people are thinking that their children have limitedfutures,'' said the Canadian consul, Andree Bazinet. ``They get allthese skills at the university and can't use them in Argentina. Weget some of our highest quality acceptances from Argentina.''   In 1986, the Canadian Embassy received 188 applications forimmigrant visas and in the first five months of this year,applications stood at 1,292. Only 275 were issued.   The Argentine government issues no figures on the number or jobskills of emigrants, but officials at variousd consulates said visaapplications are way up, and usually it's the best educated and besttrained who are taken.   The longest lines are outside the consulates of Spain and Italy,the countries to which a majority of Argentines trace their roots.Italy generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants andSpain to children of people born in those countries who neverrenounced their citizenship.   Those visas are coveted because they will allow Argentines towork thoughout Western Europe beginning in 1992, when the EuropeanEconomic Community is unified into a single market.   Australia granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987, theConsulate said, and inquiries for the nine-month period that endedin March skyrocketed to 16,330. It gave no figures on the number ofvisas to be granted.   Daniel Fainstein, dean of the Latin American Rabbinic Seminary,estimated that 2,000 Jews left Argentina last year for Israel.``There has been an increase ... because of the permanentinstability and insecurity here,'' he said.   The United States issued 1,450 to 1,500 immigrant visas toArgentines in the past few years, a consular officer said. Thenumber of applications is not kept, but it clearly exceeds thenumber of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months,the official added.   Standing in line at the U.S. Consulate, Jose Ponti said he hopesto move to Baltimore, Md., to work in his uncle's clothing store.   ``My family split in two after World War II,'' said Ponti, 27,who works on the Buenos Aires subway. ``One part went to the U.S.,another part came here to Argentina. The American side of the familyis doing very well.''</TEXT></DOC>
