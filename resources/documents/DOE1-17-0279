Other types of bioassays, including those for use with receivingwaters and in-situ testing, are not discussed. The use of acute bioassaysat hazardous-chemical sites is explained and illustrated for use in theremedial-action process. Step-by-step guidelines are presented wherebydecisions can be made concerning the design of site-specific bioassaystudies.</TEXT></DOC>
