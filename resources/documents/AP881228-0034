In an unusually tough statement, Roh issued a ``specialdirective'' to police and security forces to halt violent protestsand labor strikes, attacks on government buildings and otherpolitical violence.   ``Unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demandsgushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism ... arethreatening not only democracy but also the stability of the freeeconomy,'' he told a meeting of key government officials.   Opposition and dissident groups immediately denounced Roh'sstatement and accused the government of seeking excuses to oppressopponents and avoid any loss of authority. The National Assembly iscontrolled by the opposition.   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called Roh's directive ``aplot schemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights.''   Government leaders are concerned protests could increaseopposition to Roh because of public anger over revelations ofcorruption and human rights abuses under his predecessor, formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan.   Roh is resisting widespread demands that Chun be punished.   Radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violentprotests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the Rohgovernment. Radicals have also staged scattered attacks ongovernment and U.S. military facilities.   The protests have been small compared to major anti-governmentprotests in 1987. But officials have expressed concern at theincreasing use of violence.   Roh said today that radicals' use of firebombs and homemadeexplosives in protests had ``reached a serious phase.'' No deathsand just a few serious injuries have been reported in recentprotests.   The president also expressed concern about frequent violentstrikes and warned that labor unrest threatens economic stability.He said the government supports peaceful and legal trade unionactivity, but warned that violence and excessive union demands wouldnot be tolerated.   Roh said the transition to democracy has made great progress andviolent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to nationalstability or the desire of the great majority of Koreans for orderlychange.   ``Law and order will be thoroughly established,'' he said.   Commenting on the speech, Kim accused government hardliners ofattempting to create a false sense of crisis to frighten people intosupporting Roh and justifying restraints on government opponents.   Roh is under political pressure because he is a former ally ofChun and some Koreans identified him with his predecessor.   He has promised to hold a referendum on his rule sometime nextyear and government leaders fear the controversy surrounding Chuncould damage Roh's chances of winning and threaten his hold on power.   The president reportedly is also under pressure from governmenthardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of oppositionand left-wing groups.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing for abusesunder his rule.   Roh, also a former general, won presidential elections one yearago and has dismantled most of the authoritarian controls enacted byChun.</TEXT></DOC>
