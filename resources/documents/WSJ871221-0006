This morning, the embattled oil giant expects to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan under which it will pay Pennzoil Co. $3 billion to settle the $10.3 billion judgment Pennzoil won two years ago. Fighting back a head cold, weak after a sleepless night and two weeks of brutal negotiations, James W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, signed the surrender at about noon Saturday with the gold pen he received on his 25th anniversary with the company.    His wan look bespoke his melancholy at abandoning the company's appeal of the Pennzoil judgment -- an appeal that Texaco's lawyers privately judged to have a 1-in-5 chance. He realized that Texaco would emerge a smaller company, giving up about 20% of its net worth -- not counting any tax effects of the payment -- and possibly losing its ranking as the nation's third-largest oil company. Based on 1986 asset figures, it would now drop to No. 4.    Nevertheless, Mr. Kinnear exuded relief at getting a chance to run the company unburdened by the suffocating litigation he inherited as chief executive.    &quot;We're now going to go out and run the best damn oil company in the world,&quot; he said in an interview after signing the reorganization plan Saturday. Indeed, even amid his furious negotiations to save the company from possible extinction, Mr. Kinnear was meeting with investment bankers from Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. on a vast corporate restructuring plan under which Texaco intends to buy assets as well as shed them.    But the 59-year-old executive faces several hurdles before making good on his goal &quot;to continue to supply 6% of the free world's oil&quot; and to preserve the company's independence &quot;for a long, long time.&quot;    For one thing, the bankruptcy reorganization plan must be approved by two-thirds of the Texaco shares voting in a referendum that is scheduled to begin early in February. In addition, the plan will be challenged by certain shareholders who have sued Texaco's officers and directors for malfeasance -- lawsuits that the reorganization plan would void as if they had never been filed.    What's more, Mr. Kinnear has marching orders from his largest shareholder -- corporate raider Carl Icahn, who controls 12.3% of the company's stock -- to elevate quickly the long-depressed value of the company's shares. &quot;I want to make money,&quot; Mr. Icahn, who is not famous for his patience, recently told Mr. Kinnear even though he has already reaped a paper profit of $143 million on his stake in Texaco.    Yesterday, while saying he was &quot;very pleased to see this settled&quot; and ready to work with management, Mr. Icahn threw down the gauntlet again. &quot;To truly enhance this company,&quot; he said, &quot;it must be seriously restructured, or sold.&quot; He said he was particularly unhappy that Mr. Kinnear managed to defeat his attempt to have the reorganization plan strip Texaco of its anti-takeover defenses.    But Mr. Kinnear refuses to abide by anyone else's deadlines. &quot;Obviously, in a big company, you don't turn it around overnight,&quot; he says.    Shares of Texaco and Pennzoil are expected to rise today in response to the agreement. Their stock prices have moved higher in recent days as settlement talks progressed, but many analysts say investors have reacted cautiously in the belief that the delicate negotiations could have fallen through at any time -- as they had so many times before. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco closed at $38.50, up $2.50, while Pennzoil jumped $4.125 to $79.375.    As early as today, Texaco will begin seeking short-term bank financing for the $3 billion payment to Pennzoil, which is scheduled to occur through electronic interbank transfers in mid-April. By the reckoning of Texaco's lawyers, the sum is 11 times greater than the biggest court judgment ever sustained on appeal. It would also represent one of history's biggest payments from a single private entity to another, approaching the $4 billion that White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco paid Gordon Getty for his interest in Getty Oil Co. as part of the transaction that started the whole mess.    At the end of this litigation rainbow, the pot of gold presents Pennzoil with challenges in some ways as big as Texaco's. Sixty-five-year-old J. Hugh Liedtke, the founder and chairman of Houston-based Pennzoil, could spend every working hour until his 70th birthday counting out $100 bills and never reach the settlement total. Yet he must spend it well before then -- and get the approval of the Internal Revenue Service -- if he wants to avert an up-front tax liability of nearly $1 billion on the payment. Mr. Liedtke, in short, has a few billion burning a hole in his pocket.    Under an imaginative tax theory, Pennzoil may argue to the IRS that its 1984 contract to buy an interest in Getty Oil was an asset destroyed when Texaco bought all of Getty Oil for itself, as a jury in Houston found two years ago. A section of the tax code defers ordinary income taxes on payment for &quot;destroyed&quot; assets so long as the payment is reinvested in &quot;similar&quot; assets within two full years -- by Dec. 31, 1990, in Pennzoil's case.    Pennzoil would incur a tax liability over the life of the new assets. But if Mr. Liedtke chose not to reinvest the proceeds at all, Pennzoil would incur a liability in 1988 near the maximum corporate rate of 34%.    If Mr. Liedtke decides to reinvest the funds, thus deferring the taxes, he may have broad latitude in his choice of targets. It remains to be seen whether he would have to plow the money back into oil assets -- such as those he lost at Texaco's hands -- or whether he could replace his &quot;destroyed&quot; contract by investing the proceeds as he chooses in any other contract.    &quot;The particular facts are so unusual it kind of takes your breath away,&quot; says William Griffith of the Houston law firm of Baker andamp; Botts, who is developing Pennzoil's tax strategy.    In any case, the settlement now frees Mr. Liedtke for retirement, which he postponed on his 65th birthday last February until such time as he turned the court judgment into hard cash. But before leaving the company he founded in 1953 with Vice President George Bush, Mr. Liedtke has another piece of business to attend to: the restructuring of Pennzoil.    An early and frequent practitioner of the corporate spinoff, Mr. Liedtke has been waiting for the litigation to end before beginning his final round of divestitures, which could split Pennzoil into as many as four pieces. Besides the parent company, which owns Pennzoil's oil-and-gas operations, Pennzoil has a products company that refines and markets lubricating oil in the familiar yellow can; one of the world's largest sulfur businesses; and an outfit called Richland Corp., which owns Pennzoil's real estate and a pet gold-mining project in Indonesia.    It is Richland, many of Mr. Liedtke's followers believe, that could become his post-retirement plaything, a company that could ultimately receive the cash from Texaco or the assets purchased with it. Or, if he chooses to retire altogether to his Arkansas fishing hole and cattle ranch, Pennzoil could distribute the money directly to shareholders in an after-tax dividend of about $2 billion, or about $48 a share -- not giving any effect to the potentially huge legal fees that could be taken off the top.    For another group, the Pennzoil-Texaco armistice brings nothing but relief. The former directors of Getty Oil -- as well as its major shareholders, Gordon Getty and the J. Paul Getty Museum -- are absolved in the plan of any liability to anyone for their actions in breaking the Pennzoil deal and switching to Texaco. Pennzoil still has suits pending against the Getty interests, Texaco shareholders have filed suits of their own, and even Texaco has previously indicated it might seek to recover any litigation losses from Mr. Getty and the Getty Museum.    Like nearly every important provision of the plan, the &quot;global release,&quot; as some lawyers are calling it, was born in the furious settlement negotiations of the past two weeks. Lawyers representing certain Getty interests told Pennzoil that if it didn't push for a release of any and all claims against the Getty people, then they, in turn, might sue Pennzoil if any judgments befell them.    Meanwhile, the $3 billion Texaco-Pennzoil settlement figure, finally agreed upon at about 4 a.m. Saturday, is nearly an exact compromise -- and a huge one -- of the companies' hard-set positions in the hours before Texaco filed for Chapter 11 protection last April 12. Pennzoil was demanding $4.1 billion in cash and threatening to ratchet the figure higher with each passing victory in the courts. Texaco made a variety of offers valued at half that amount, winning Mr. Liedtke fame on the cover of Fortune as &quot;The Man Who Turned Down $2 Billion.&quot; Mr. Liedtke -- who once decorated his office with a poster of W.C. Fields as a riverboat gambler, clutching his cards to his vest -- was convinced he could get more.    On the bottom line, Texaco saved itself about $1 billion by thrusting itself into Chapter 11, but at a cost to its shareholders of at least that amount. Texaco doesn't yet know when it will resume the dividend wiped out by the filing, but over a year's time the loss to investors will total $780 million. The missed corporate opportunities, higher borrowing expenses and other costs reached into &quot;the tens of millions of dollars,&quot; a company lawyer estimates.    &quot;There will be an ongoing need to redevelop credibility,&quot; Mr. Kinnear acknowledges. But, he quickly adds: &quot;Looking back would I do it again? Yes, I would.&quot; Texaco only wanted the chance to stay alive while appealing a judgment it has called &quot;tainted&quot; and &quot;utterly incredible,&quot; he says. &quot;We gave the system a chance,&quot; he adds glumly, &quot;and the system failed.&quot;    The company won't ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the judgment unless shareholders vote down the reorganization plan. In the meantime, to preserve its right to appeal in case the settlement is dashed, Texaco will seek all the appeal-deadline extensions the court can give. Should the court deny the necessary extensions to Texaco, Pennzoil could request one. If the court continued denying extensions, &quot;it would be telling you something&quot; -- namely, that it was eager to review, and perhaps reverse, the judgment, a Texaco lawyer says. In that case, shareholders might be less likely to approve the $3 billion settlement.    Shareholder approval would also become less likely if the Securities and Exchange Commission publicly announced it was supporting Texaco's appeal, as it did on one narrow but important aspect before the Texas Supreme Court.    But Texaco expects shareholders to approve the plan, and Mr. Kinnear expects Mr. Icahn to give him a chance to prove himself as an oil man. &quot;I don't have any quarrel with Carl Icahn,&quot; Mr. Kinnear says. &quot;He and I get along very well.&quot;    Mr. Kinnear's first challenge will be to permanently fund the $3 billion payment to Pennzoil, which will probably increase the company's debt level to 46% of total capitalization from the current level of about 36%. Texaco must also make more than $2 billion in payments to other creditors, all of whom would receive 100 cents on the dollar, plus interest.    Creditors have identified the company's controlling interest in Texaco Canada as a prime candidate for the auction block to raise funds. Texaco's Far Eastern refining and marketing operations -- which it jointly operates with Chevron Corp. under the trade name Caltex -- could also be sold. Texaco hasn't yet ruled out any asset sales, but Texaco Canada and Caltex are among its most profitable ventures, and Mr. Kinnear says it is his objective, as part of an overall corporate restructuring, &quot;to sell the least productive things.&quot;    He also wants to buy some assets -- perhaps some petrochemical operations, for instance -- but the company will probably be smaller in the end. Still, Mr. Kinnear wants to make significant outlays in the hunt for new oil fields, which Texaco needs to address its most pressing long-term problem: All the oil majors are running out of oil, but Texaco much faster than most.    That is why Texaco laid out $10 billion to buy Getty Oil in what was then history's largest takeover. For years, Texaco has been known as one of the worst oil finders in the business, an impression that was strengthened in 1986, when Texaco had, by far, the highest finding costs in the industry.    But Mr. Kinnear says the tide has already turned. &quot;People will be very pleasantly surprised by our reserve disclosures this year,&quot; he says. Although the company has continued producing more oil than it has discovered, &quot;the reserve picture, which was a problem, is being handled,&quot; he insists.    Mr. Kinnear might be forgiven for talking so self-assuredly, for although he agreed to settle for more than he ever wished, he wound up giving a lot less than many told him to -- including some people in his own company.    &quot;Do I think I could have gotten it {the settlement} for less?&quot; he asks. &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;    On a Friday evening earlier this month, Mr. Kinnear received a visit from Mr. Icahn, who told him that Mr. Liedtke was willing to accept $3.5 billion. Mr. Kinnear told his largest shareholder, &quot;It's just too high. I'm not going to do it.&quot;    Mr. Kinnear sat stoically. Finally Mr. Icahn burst out, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;    &quot;Go fishing.&quot;    &quot;You might not have a company when you come back,&quot; Mr. Icahn shot back.    &quot;Well,&quot; Mr. Kinnear deadpanned, &quot;they can't take my fishing pole.&quot;    In the following two weeks of negotiations, Mr. Kinnear and his advisers went up against continually shifting alliances among Mr. Icahn, Pennzoil and committees representing Texaco shareholders and creditors -- all with their own varying agendas. And there were times when his own management and factions on the board urged him to go along with settlement figures he was uncomfortable with. At one point, even Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane urged him to bend to a $3.5 billion offer to settle, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.    The creditors' committee put one of the first settlement proposals on the table. It devised a creative plan that would have allowed Texaco to give Pennzoil a nonrefundable base payment in return for a promise from Pennzoil to cap its award, even if the full judgment was sustained on appeal. Creditors, Pennzoil and Texaco at different times put forward their own numbers, ranging from a base payment of as low as $370 million to a cap of as much as $5 billion.    But the so-called base-cap proposal wasn't destined to succeed. Approval by Pennzoil, the largest creditor, was necessary -- and the company wouldn't go along with any of the lower numbers that Mr. Kinnear and the company's creditors deemed acceptable.    A decision by Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg on Dec. 8, which gave the shareholders' committee an active role in the talks, was a pivotal point. By that evening, Robert Norris, chairman of the committee, was on the phone with Pennzoil's Mr. Liedtke, who by this time stated simply that he wanted more than $3 billion. That was fine as far as Mr. Norris was concerned. By the next morning, the extremely literal Mr. Norris was in Houston offering the Pennzoil chief $3.001 billion. Four days later, the creditors joined in, casting their lot behind a &quot;cram-down,&quot; or a bankruptcy reorganization plan forced upon the debtor.    The bad news was delivered to Texaco last Monday, when David Boies, the company's chief litigator, and Harvey Miller, its lead bankruptcy lawyer, were summoned to a meeting of more than two dozen creditor and shareholder lawyers. They were presented with a fait accompli -- a settlement of $3.001 billion with Pennzoil. And there was more. All the company's takeover defenses would be dissolved. And management's financial flexibility would be severely crimped by onerous debt covenants that would survive even after the company's discharge from Chapter 11.    Barely able to respond, Mr. Boies, well-known for his casual dress amid the pinstripe pomp of Wall Street, tugged his pullover sweater over his head and stalked out with Mr. Miller.    The united front of shareholders, creditors and Pennzoil started to crack the next day when Mr. Icahn withdrew his support for the plan, believing that Texaco would never accept it. Texaco's attorneys had vowed to file a competing plan of Texaco's own design, one that would surely prevent either of the two proposals from winning the necessary two-thirds shareholder vote.    Mr. Kinnear, adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy, saw his opportunity. He negotiated with each group separately, telling them that Pennzoil would be the only beneficiary in any reorganization of Texaco. And if they weren't willing to back off, he would &quot;bet the ranch&quot; by taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. With the exception of Pennzoil, the remaining parties capitulated Thursday night.    The two companies quickly struck a deal for $3 billion. For 24 hours, their attorneys haggled over a table in conference room 30-D at Weil, Gotschal andamp; Manges, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel. Forgotten in the heat of the debate was the $1 million extra that the shareholders' committee had left on the table. In what one Texaco lawyer calls &quot;an act of supreme graciousness,&quot; Pennzoil's Mr. Liedtke agreed to give up the small change. Pennzoil further caved in when it dropped its demand for interest totaling about $1 million a day until payment of the settlement.    Mr. Kinnear stationed himself at Weil Gotschal with his battery of attorneys as the draft plan was examined line by line. Mr. Liedtke slipped in and out of Pennzoil's New York offices, looking at the plan as it came off the word processor in the wee hours of Saturday morning.    By late that morning, the deal was done. The two chief executives never saw each other, executing separate copies of the same document. But by phone, they expressed to each other their gratitude for the chance to return to the oil business.    &quot;Good luck to you,&quot; said Mr. Liedtke.    &quot;Good luck to you,&quot; answered Mr. Kinnear.    ---        Pennzoil v.
