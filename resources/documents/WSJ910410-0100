But then the Fedintervened in the money markets, draining reserves from thebanking system, in a move that analysts interpreted as aclear signal that Fed policy remains on hold.   Still, many investment managers expect the Fed to cutrates soon to bolster the economy. &quot;I think the Fed is goingto ease, although not until after the inflation reports&quot; tobe released by the government later this week, said James K.Ho, a senior vice president at John Hancock Advisers Inc., aunit of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston.   A government report tomorrow on producer prices in Marchis expected to show little or no change. A separate reportFriday on March consumer prices is expected to show a smallincrease of about 0.2%. If so, that would greatly increasepressure on the Fed to cut rates swiftly, Mr. Ho and severalother investment managers said.   The Fed's reserve-draining move yesterday &quot;was clearlyundertaken to show the markets the Fed isn't easing yet,&quot;said Elliott Platt, director of economic research atDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;But if we getgood CPI and PPI statistics, then I think there is areasonable probability that the Fed would ease.&quot;   In the municipal bond market, a large new issue forDenver's planned new airport drew a more enthusiasticreaction from investors than several analysts had expected.However, to attract investors, the issue had to offer yieldsas high as 9.19% on bonds due in 2023.   That is more than 2 1/4 percentage points higher thanyields on top-rated, uninsured revenue bonds with similarmaturities, said James P. Marzano, president of AppliedMunicipal Network in Chicago. A yield of 9.19% translatesinto a taxable equivalent yield of more than 13% forinvestors in the top federal tax bracket.   Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. said the issuewas oversubscribed, and that investor appetite was so keenthat the size of the issue was increased to $500 million from$450 million. Mutual funds specializing in high-yieldmunicipal bonds snapped up large amounts of the issue,several analysts said. The bonds for the Denver airport arerated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. andtriple-B-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., just barely in theinvestment-grade category.   The bonds are backed solely by revenues to be generated bythe new airport. The bonds are not guaranteed by Denver or bythe state of Colorado. Interest on these bonds is subject tothe federal alternative minimum tax.   The new airport is expected to open in October 1993, MayorFederico Pena said yesterday. But the project has beenthreatened by a weakening economy and declining airlinetravel, political challenges, the bankruptcy filing ofContinental Airlines Holdings Inc. and its ContinentalAirlines Inc. unit, and a lack of commitment from UAL Corp.'sUnited Airlines Inc. unit.   The airport, which is now slated to cost about $2 billion,is under construction, and the project is on time and underbudget. But debate over whether construction should becontinued or delayed has been heating up in recent weeks inDenver. Opponents of the project argue that the new facilityisn't needed because air traffic has declined at the city'sStapleton Airport. In addition, opponents say they areconcerned about the future of Continental Airlines, which isoperating under Chapter 11, and the lack of an agreement byUnited Airlines to use the new airport.   One major mayoral candidate, Don Bain, has called for ahalt to the project. And a group of airport opponents havefiled papers to begin a drive for signatures that would callfor a referendum on the project. City voters approved theproject about two years ago, but recent polls have indicatedthey would not approve it today. Nevertheless, local pollsshow most people want the project completed now that it isunderway.   The city has reduced the size of the project, reflectinglower traffic projections, reducing the cost estimate byabout $300 million. But that has only renewed debate, ascritics ask why the city insists on building a new airportthat's no bigger than Stapleton, which is to be closed whenDenver International opens in 1993.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury bond prices fell yesterday.   Prices declined slightly in the morning and then moresharply in the afternoon. The Treasury's benchmark 30-yearbond was quoted late in the day at 96 1/4, to yield 8.20%.The issue traded late Monday at 96 3/4, to yield 8.15%.   Traders said part of the slump reflected concern about alarge volume of government borrowing that will hit themarkets over the next few weeks. Today, for example, theTreasury plans to sell $8.5 billion of seven-year notes. Inwhen-issued trading, the notes were quoted late yesterday ata yield of 7.92%, up 0.06 percentage point from late Monday.   &quot;We're going into a season where you have supply coming,&quot;says William Brachfeld, executive vice president at DaiwaSecurities America Inc. &quot;Between now and the end of May, theStreet is going to bid on lots of securities.&quot;   Rates on short-term Treasury bills inched higher. Onthree-month bills, for example, the discount rate rose to5.61% bid from an average rate of 5.60% set at Monday'sauction.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Municipal bond prices generally were little changed todown slightly yesterday.   Prices of several large state and local government issuesdeclined about 1/8 point. But the Orlando, Fla., UtilitiesCommission's 5.50% bonds of 2026 were unchanged at 82 1/8, toyield 6.81%.   The Denver airport bond issue drew especially closeattention yesterday because of its high yields. The issueincluded bonds priced to yield from 7.80% on bonds due in1995 to as much as 9.19% in 2023. The average interest rateon the bonds was 9.13%, according to Denver officials.   Although that may sound like an extremely high borrowingcost, Denver Mayor Pena said the city had thought it mighthave even been more expensive. &quot;These are changingcircumstances,&quot; he said, &quot;and we're very pleased with therate.&quot;   Recently, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered its rating onthe $900 million in new airport revenue bonds the city soldlast year to triple-B-minus, just a notch above junk grade.The rating agency said new concerns about air traffic andContinental's financial condition led to the change. Moody's,however, has retained its slightly higher rating of Baa-1.   Denver Mayor Pena said the bond sale sends a message toairport critics that &quot;this airport will be built.&quot; He alsotermed the sale of the bonds &quot;successful,&quot; commenting thatincreased uncertainty in the airline industry was the causefor the higher interest on the bonds. Last year, the city'sairport bonds were sold at 8.63%.   &quot;A strong message from America's financial markets wassent again today,&quot; he said, adding that the message was: &quot;Thenation needs Denver International Airport, and we haveconfindence in Denver's ability to build it.&quot;                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Casino rose as bondholders andreal estate developer Donald Trump reached an agreement onrefinancing the casino's $675 million in debt.   The agreement had been expected, but &quot;the fact that theplan is now ready to go to bondholders for a vote removedsome of the uncertainty,&quot; said Robert Kricheff, high-yieldanalyst at First Boston andamp; Co.   Trump Taj Mahal Funding's 14% first mortgage bonds, due in1998, rose 3 1/2 points to 61 1/2 on the American StockExchange.   Elsewhere, prices of junk bonds -- high-yield securitieswith low credit ratings or no credit rating at all -- were1/8 to 1/4 point lower.   In the investment-grade corporate bond market, short-termsecurities were down about 1/8 point, while longer-termsecurities were as much as 1/2 point lower.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          German, British and Japanese government bond prices fellyesterday, while French issues were little changed.   In Germany, prices of some government issues slippednearly 1/4 point, with several analysts citing continuedinflation fears as the main cause. Traders say there may befresh interest-rate signals today from Germany's centralbank, the Bundesbank. Some analysts predict the Bundesbankwill push short-term rates slightly higher soon.   British government bond prices fell slightly on concernabout the government's growing budget deficit and nervousnessabout how investors will react to a large new governmentissue expected today. Among active issues, Britain's 11.75%bonds due 2003/2007 fell 6/32 point to 111 13/32, to yield10.06%. Today, the U.K. plans to sell an #800 million ($1.42billion) issue due in 2008.   In Tokyo, traders said the slump in bond prices partlyreflected investor concern about a large supply of new issueshitting the markets. Electric power companies are expected tooffer 280 billion yen ($1.46 billion) of domestic bonds incoming weeks. That would be in addition to a large supply ofnew government debt offered so far this month. The Japanesegovernment's benchmark No. 129, 6.4% issue due 2000 fell 0.11to 98.51 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.   In the Eurobond market, several new issues dominatedactivity. Among these was Alliance andamp; Leicester BuildingSociety's #100 million issue of 11.375%, six-year bonds. Theissue was priced to yield 11.44%, one percentage point abovethe comparable British government issue. Dealers said theissue initially has received an unenthusiastic response frominvestors.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-securities prices closed lower.   Among actively traded issues, Government National MortgageAssociation 8.5% securities for April delivery were down 10/32 at 97 18/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 8.5%securities were off 10/32 at 97 1/2 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities were down 10/32 at 979/32.   The derivative mortgage-backed securities market got areprieve from the recent heated pace of real estate mortgageinvestment conduit issuance as dealers sought to lightentheir inventories of new deals.   No Remic deals were announced, the first issue-free day inmore than a week, but the pause is expected to be temporary.   ---   Marj Charlier in Denver contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
