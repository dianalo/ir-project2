While Boeing may want help in bearing the risk of developing amultibillion-dollar new plane, the Japanese companies see apartnership as a way to learn the commercial aircraft business.   Some experts on international trade are worried what mighthappen if the Japanese learn too well.   In Tokyo, a spokesman for Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. saidWednesday that Chairman Kenko Hasegawa and the chairmen ofMitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.received official invitations from Boeing to join in the design,production and sale of the 767-X.   ``It will allow us to learn both the hard and soft aspects (ofthe airplane industry) from a top-level firm,'' said a Mitsubishiofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The three companies have long worked with Boeing assubcontractors and were partners with the Seattle aerospace companyon a smaller jet that was never built.   The wide-body 767-X would be Boeing's entry in the 300-passengerjetliner class now dominated by the European consortium AirbusIndustrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp.   No decision has been made to build the plane. Boeing spokesmanDick Schleh said the 767-X has been under consideration for morethan a year and discussions with Fuji, Kawasaki and Mitsubishi havebeen proceeding for three months or more.   The three have worked with Boeing since the mid-1970s, and,along with Italy's Aeritalia, have been ``risk-sharing partners,''on the 767, which began development 11 years ago. Such partners,Boeing says, share in financial risks and rewards of an aircraftprogram, rather than just being paid for components.   The Japanese companies make fuselage panels for the twin-engine,wide-body 767. They and other Japanese firms also aresubcontractors for Boeing 737s, 747s and 757s, making such parts asgearboxes, altimeters, wing ribs and lavatories.   The extended-range 767-300ER can carry 210 passengers in threeclasses 7,200 miles, and holds up to 290 passengers in anall-tourist-class configuration. Boeing's next-largest plane is the747, which can haul 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles.   What Boeing lacks is a plane to compete with Airbus' A300, A330and A340 models, which can hold 250 to 335 passengers, andMcDonnell Douglas' MD-11, which holds about 320.   Other than to say the 767-X is envisioned as falling between the767 and 747, Schleh and Boeing spokesman Craig Martin wouldn'tdiscuss what the plane might look like. Among possibilitiesmentioned by industry observers is a double-decker wide-body.   Fuji, Kawasaki and Mitsubishi were to have a 25 percent share inthe development of Boeing's 7J7, a 150-passenger plane that was tobe powered by new-technology ``unducted fan'' engines. Thatproject, announced in 1985, was put on hold when no buyersmaterialized.   When the question of Japanese involvement came up then, BoeingCommercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said the Japanese``were going to become involved in a commercial jet program one wayor another. We sure as hell didn't want them to get involved withAirbus Industrie.''   Japanese involvement with the 767-X could range from a supplierrelationship to a partnership, Martin said.   The Japan Economic Journal this week estimated the 767-X's totaldevelopment cost at $4 billion and said the three Japanese firmsare expected to bear about 20 percent of that.   Since World War II, Japan has produced just one type of civilianairliner, a 60-passenger turboprop. It also makes military planes,mostly under license from U.S. manufacturers.   It has agreed with the United States on joint development ofJapan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. That program wasapproved after a hard fight in Congress, where critics said the $6billion project amounted to a giveaway of U.S. technology thatJapan could use to become competitive in the civilian aircraftmarket.   Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a senior associate at the CarnegieEndowment and a former Commerce Department trade negotiator, waswary of a Boeing-Japan deal, though he stressed he did not knowspecifics.   He said aerospace has been identified as one of the mostimportant industries for Japan in the 21st century. ``There is thepotential for substantial technology transfer to Japanese companieswithout getting much back,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
