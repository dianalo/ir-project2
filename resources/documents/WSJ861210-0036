The Rev. Leon Sullivan, pastor of Zion Baptist Church in Philadelphia, who developed the principles in 1977, said the &quot;good progress&quot; category had so few members &quot;because the requirements are tough.&quot; He also complained that some companies lack the will to do better.    The requirements, however, were eased a bit when companies complained about the amount of money Rev. Sullivan expected them to spend on &quot;social justice.&quot; Spending levels were lowered to improve the grades for some firms, according to D. Reid Weedon, senior vice president of Arthur D. Little Inc., the Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm that monitors compliance with the principles.    Officials at Little don't check each company's South African operations to verify the responses, but do require each company to provide an independent auditor's statement confirming the companies' stated spending levels on such areas as medical care and housing.    Of the 129 reporting companies, 39 are &quot;making good progress&quot; in meeting the Sullivan Principles, according to the report, while 72 are &quot;making progress&quot; and 18 &quot;need to become more active.&quot;    Sullivan signatory companies fall into five groups, under three main categories. To be in the top two categories, a company must meet nine basic requirements including equal pay for equal work, desegregation of all company facilities and freedom for black workers to join trade unions.    Category I -- &quot;making good progress&quot; -- includes those firms that score high on a point system that judges a company's involvement in four &quot;action areas&quot;: training and advancement, community development, social justice and education for non-employees.    Companies &quot;making progress&quot; have lower, yet acceptable scores. They are assigned to Category IIA if they submit a long, detailed report of their activities. They are assigned to Category IIB if they file a short reporting form. Category IIIA firms passed the basic requirements, but received a low point rating in the action areas.    Since the principles were developed, companies have used the code to demonstrate their opposition to racial oppression and to justify their presence in South Africa. Apartheid opponents have accused the firms of hiding behind the code while supporting South Africa's white minority regime by bolstering its economy.    The report covers a reporting period that ended June 30. Some companies listed in the report -- such as General Motors Corp., International Business Machines Corp, Eastman Kodak Co. and Coca-Cola Co. -- have pulled out of South Africa or have announced withdrawal plans.    Anti-apartheid activists have criticized withdrawal schemes that permit the U.S. companies to continue supplying parts and equipment to South Africa. Mr. Sullivan said that type of withdrawal was an important step, because it maintained jobs for blacks.    He repeated, however, a call for a total U.S. trade embargo against South Africa if statutory apartheid is not stopped by next May 31. His main objective is to end apartheid, Mr. Sullivan said, &quot;not to protect businesses or keep them there.&quot;    ---   CATEGORY I   MAKING GOOD PROGRESS   Abbott Laboratories   American Home Products   Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc.
