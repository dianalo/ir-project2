The proposed changes are intended primarily to codify certaininterpretations of the rule and to make technical revisions in the ruleto accommodate recent legislation. In addition, the Board proposes to modifythe bases for supervisory objection to approval of a subordinated debtapplication now found at 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(2) by authorizing the Officeof Regulatory Activities of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (``Officeof Regulatory Actitivies'') to develop guidelines to specify the basesfor supervisory objection to the issuance of subordinated debt. The Boardwould then expect to limit the imposition of non-standard conditions insubordinated debt approvals. Accordingly, the Board proposes to deletecertain of the bases for supervisory objection currently specified in theregulation, some of which have become obsolete, and to direct the Officeof Regulatory Activities to prepare and promulgate guidelines that wouldspecify supervisory bases for objection to subordinated debt applications,in order to implement the general standards contained in the proposed regulation.Further, the Board proposes to give the Principal Supervisory Agents (``PSAs'')authority to deny as well as to approve subordinated debt applications.Coupled with this new authority, the regulation would include an appealprocess designed to provide ``final agency action.''Finally, the Board is proposing and soliciting comment on a set of standardconditions that would be applicable to approvals of applications to includesubordinated debt in regulatory capital. Except in highly unusual circumstancesor where supervisory objections are raised based on the guidelines developedby the Office of Regulatory Activities in effect at that time, the Boardwould expect that such standard conditions would be the only conditionsimposed by the Board or its delegates on the approval of subordinated debtapplications.The Board is of the view that in the current regulatory and economic climate,subordinated debt is a viable and acceptable adjunct to regulatory capitalunder appropriate circumstances, and the Board reaffirms its intentionto continue to allow subordinated debt issued pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1to be included in the regulatory capital of an insured institution under12 CFR 561.13.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to: Director, Information Services Section,Office of the Secretariat, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 1700 G Street,NW., Washington, DC 20552.

Background</ITAG>Since 1973, the Board, as operating head of the FSLIC, has permitted insuredinstitutions to include as part of their regulatory capital the proceedsof the sale of subordinated debt securities issued pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1.Initially, insured institutions were permitted to include as regulatorycapital the principal amount of such debt securities up to a limit of 20percent of their capital requirements. In 1982, the Board amended its regulationsto allow insured institutions to include the full amount of the proceedsof the sale of subordinated debt securities having a remaining maturityin excess of one year as part of their capital and statutory reserve requirements.\1\<NOTE/> On April 18, 1985, the Board further amended andSection;andSection;563.8-1 and 561.13 of the Insurance Regulations (the definition of regulatorycapital) to require that the amount of qualifying subordinated debt witha remaining period to maturity of less than seven years that may be includedas regulatory capital must be reduced annually pursuant to an amortizationschedule set forth in andSection; 561.13.\2\<NOTE/> The principal rationale underlying the Board's decision toallow the inclusion in regulatory capital of the proceeds of the sale ofsubordinated debt securities issued under 12 CFR 563.8-1 is that subordinateddebt has some of the characteristics of other types of permanent capitaland reduces the risks to the FSLIC. The Board continues to be of the viewthat subordinated debt may serve as a viable and acceptable component ofregulatory capital under appropriate circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Resolution No. 82-581, (August 26, 1982). Under GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles (``GAAP''), subordinated debt is treatedas a liability.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Resolution No. 85-292, 50 FR 20550 (May 17, 1985).On August 10, 1987, the President signed into law the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552. The CEBAaddresses a number of important issues relating specifically to the thriftindustry, including the recapitalization of the FSLIC, emergency acquisitionsof troubled thrift institutions, and potential areas for improvement inthe examination and supervisory process. As required by CEBA, the Boardon October 9, 1987 promulgated Applications Processing Guidelines as partof 12 CFR 571.12. The present regulatory proposal is necessitated in partof CEBA, the new guidelines (12 CFR 571.12), and also reflects an additionalthree years of experience with the subordinated debt regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Discussion of the Proposals</ITAG>1. Issuance of GuidelinesThe Board desires to update and provide a mechanism to clarify and keepcurrent the bases for supervisory objection to applications to includesubordinated debt in regulatory capital of insured institutions, and toincrease efficiency in approving applications to include subordinated debtissues as part of regulatory capital. Accordingly, the Board proposes todelegate additional authority to the PSAs to approve or deny subordinateddebt applications and has directed the Federal Home Loan Bank System'sOffice of Regulatory Activities (``Office of Regulatory Activities'') toestablish and administer Guidelines to be applied by the PSAs in assessingsupervisory considerations presented by subordinated debt applicationsunder andSection; 563.8-1.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In its release No. 87-1298 dated December 22, 1987, theBoard similarly authorized the Office of Regulatory Activities to developguidelines for administering the Board's new rule providing for individualminimum capital requirements. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.14.In keeping with the Board's desire to have uniform national supervisorypolicies, the Office of Regulatory Activities, under the Board's oversight,would establish Guidelines for the PSAs to apply in exercising authorityto be delegated to them in considering subordinated debt applications.These Guidelines will identify supervisory factors that PSAs may use inconsidering whether to approve or deny an application. Some of the currentbases for supervisory objections now set forth at CFR 563.8-1(b)(2) areobsolete and will be revised and/or expanded into Guidelines. These Guidelineswill be illustrative but not exclusive bases for supervisory objectionto subordinated debt applications. The format of Guidelines will allowfor increased flexibility in future modifications, as needed. The Officeof Regulatory Activities will be able in the future to change the Guidelinesas circumstances warrant, without the necessity for notice and commentrulemaking.2. Defaults and Other Events Providing for Mandatory Prepayment of PrincipalOne of the factors considered in the processing of a subordinated debtapplication is whether the issuance of the subordinated debt securitiesand any related transactions will result in a transfer of risk from theFSLIC to parties other than insured institutions. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(3). The Board, on the basis of this provision,has objected to the inclusion in subordinated debt instruments of termsthat provide for mandatory redemption of the debt or for events of default(which could give rise to acceleration of maturity of the principal ofthe debt) based on changes in control of the obligor (known in anti-takeoverparlance as a ``poisoned put''), or a failure of the obligor to complywith maintenance and operating convenants which were believed to be unreasonablein the circumstances. In this connection, the Board notes that one of thebases for permitting an insured institution to incluse an amount equalto the proceeds of the sale of subordinated debt securities in its regulatorycapital is that the issuance of such securities represents a relativelylong term commitment of capital to the insured institution. For this reason,the Board has not approved subordinated debt applications where the subordinateddebt securities (or the indentures pursuant to which they were proposedto be issued) included provisions that might unduly accelerate paymentof the debt prior to scheduled maturities, because such provisions couldsubject the FSLIC to a significant risk of precipitious decline in an institution'sregulatory capital. The Board recognizes, however, that to effect a successfulpublic offering of debt securities, the securities, or the indentures pursuantto which they are issued, must include provisions that the investment communityhas come to accept as customary in offerings of such type, to the extentsuch provisions can be included without frustrating the purpose of thesubordinated debt regulation. Thus, although provisions that require accelerationof maturity (through declaration, mandatory prepayments, or otherwise)following a change of control of the obligor will continue to be objectionable,the Board will not object to subordinated debt applications solely becausethe terms of the securities (or related indentures) include events of defaultsuch as failure to make timely payment of interest and principal, failureto comply with reasonable and customary financial maintenance and operatingcovenants, and certain events of bankruptcy. Appropriate revisions to addclarifying language to 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(3) will address this consideration.3. Voluntary PrepaymentsThe subordinated debt regulation provides that payment of principal maynot be accelerated without approval of the FSLIC, if, after giving effectto such accelerated payment, the insured institution obligor would failto meet its regulatory capital requirement. 12 CFR 563.8-1(d)(1)(iv). TheBoard has consistently taken the position that if any mandatory prepayment(such as payment upon acceleration of maturity following an event of default)is restricted to this extent, <T3>a fortiori </T3>any voluntary prepayment should be similarly restricted.A revision in 12 CFR 563.8-1(d)(1)(iv) is proposed to reflect this long-standinginterpretive position.4. Issuance of Subordinated Debt Securities Pursuant to an IndentureThe Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (``TIA'') 15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb,which, by its terms is inapplicable to securities issued by insured institutions,and the Rules nad Regulations under the TIA provide, generally, that anydebt securities offered and sold to the public by a single obligor in anamount in excess of $2,000,000 in any consecutive twelve month period mustbe issued pursuant to an indenture and that debt securities which are publiclyoffered and sold by the same obligor in an amount exceeding $5,000,000in any consecutive thirty-sixty month period must be issued pursuant toan indenture that is ``qualified'' under the TIA. See 17 CFR 260.4(a)(1)and 260.4(a)(2). Although the TIA specifies in considerable detail theprovisions which must be included in a qualified indenture (which requiredprovisions relate principally to the qualifications, duties and powersof the trustee, the duties of the obligor, and the rights of the holdersof the debt securities) neither the TIA nor the rules promulgated thereunderset forth any requirements with respect to the provisions of a non-qualifiedindenture. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, for many years,has taken the position that any indenture must, at a minimum, provide forthe appointment of a trustee other than the obligor or an affiliate ofthe obligor and provide some reasonable procedures for the collective enforcementof the rights of the holders of the debt securities.The Board's experience has been that most publicly offered issues of subordinateddebt securities of any significant size by insured institutions are offeredand sold through underwriters, and in such cases the securities are invariablyissued pursuant to an indenture that includes all or substantially allof the provisions that would be required to be included in an indenturequalified under the TIA. The use of an indenture in connection with theissuance of subordinated debt securities can be beneficial, since certainof the terms included in such an indenture may provide a framework of financialdiscipline for the obligor, which in some cases may further the interestsof the FSLIC. Further, it may be more efficient and workable for the insuredinstitution obligor to deal with a trustee (whole actions may be subjectto ratification by the holders of a specified majority in principal amountof the debt securities) if the debtor should desire to amend the termsof the securities or to obtain a waiver of any convenants provided therein,or in the related indenture, rather than to contend with a large numberof individual security holders. Nevertheless, the Board is aware that therequirement to use an indenture will result in additional expense to certainissuing institutions.The Board requests comments as to whether subordinated debt securitiesissued pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1 should be required to be issued pursuantto an indenture. In addition, the Board requests commenters to addresswhether it would be desirable to provide only for the appointment of atrustee other than the obligor or an affiliate of the obligor and for thecollective enforcement of the rights and remedies of the security holders,if the aggregate amount of debt securities publicly offered and sold bya single obligor in any consecutive twelve month period exceeds $2,000,000or whether the indenture should also include the provisions that wouldbe required in an indenture to be qualified under the TIA if the aggregateamount of debt securities publicly offered and sold by the same obligorin any consecutive thirty-six month period exceeds $5,000,000.5. ReportsThe Board proposes to add another sentence to the requirement in 12 CFR563.8-1(h) that an insured institution must file a report with the Board30 days after completion of the sale of subordinated debt securities. Thissentence would clarify that the amount to be included in regulatory capitalis an amount <T3>net </T3>of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale of thesubordinated debt securities. This revised provision will require the issuinginstitution to specify the actual amount of the proceeds from the saleof the subordinated debt securities that the institution intends to includein its regulatory capital.6. Delegations of Authority to Principal Supervisory AgentsPresently, PSAs are authorized to approve applications filed pursuant to12 CFR 563.8-1 unless such applications involve significant issues of lawor policy upon which the Board has not taken a formal position, or unlessan offering circular will be required in connection with the public offeringand sale of the securities which are the subject of any such application.The Board now proposes to eliminate the requirement that an applicationbe forwarded to Washington solely because an offering circular is involvedand proposes further to give the PSAs authority to deny applications aswell as to approve them, subject to an appeal process. Applicants mustbe aware, however, that even though the PSA under the proposed regulatoryamendments could approve a subordinated debt application where securitiesare to be sold pursuant to an offering circular even if such offering circularhas not yet been declared effective, PSA approval would be conditionedupon the offering circular in the form declared effective not disclosingany material adverse information concerning the applicant's business, operations,prospects, or financial condition not disclosed in the latest form of offeringcircular filed as an exhibit to the subordinated debt application.To clarify further the regulation concerning delegations of authority inaccordance with current practice, the Board proposes to delegate authorityto exercise discretion to approve or deny requests for extensions of timerequested pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1(g) to whomever is authorized to approvean application. Such extensions of time could be granted for a period oftime of up to six months. All such extensions of time taken together maynot exceed one year from the date of original approval of the subordinateddebt application.7. AppealsIn connection with the proposed delegation of authority to the PSAs todeny applications under 12 CFR 563.8-1, the Board proposes to institutean appeal process for the further consideration of denials of applicationsby the PSAs. This appeal process is modeled after the appeal process forapplications relating to acquisitions of control of insured institutionsfound at 12 CFR 574.8(a)(4). In essence, the appeal process will requireany applicant wishing to appeal a determination by the PSA to file withthe Office of District Banks, within 30 days of the PSA's determination,a written request for review describing with specificity the action appealedfrom and the relief sought. The filing of such a request will be necessaryto seek judicial review of an initial determination.The Director of the Office of District Banks, with the concurrence of theExecutive Director of the Office of Regulatory Activities, and the GeneralCounsel or their designees shall consider appeals from denials by the PSAsunless the Director of the Office of District Banks in his or her solediscretion determines to refer the appeal to the Board on the basis thatthe appeal involves policy considerations that warrant resolution by theBoard. In the event that the Director of the Office of District Banks failsto obtain the concurrence of the Executive Director of the Office of RegulatoryActivities and the General Counsel, the Director of the Office of DistrictBanks shall present the matter to the Board.8. Standard Conditions of ApprovalThe Board is also proposing an Appendix to the proposed subordinated debtregulation. The Appendix contains a set of standard conditions that willbe applicable to all approvals of subordinated debt applications. The Boardanticipates that such conditions will, except in rare cases, be the onlyconditions applied to subordinated debt approvals. Other conditions wouldbe imposed only where one or more of the bases for supervisory objectionspecified in the Guidelines to be developed by the Office of RegulatoryActivities are present and where such non-standard conditions are necessaryto address the areas of concern that would otherwise form a basis for denialof the application. These standard conditions of approval also will applyto any subordinated debt application that is approved automatically pursuantto the Board's Applications Processing Guidelines, 12 CFR 571.12.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis:1. Reasons, Objectives, and Legal Basis Underlying the Proposed RuleThese elements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>.2. Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rule Would ApplyThe proposed rule would apply to all FSLIC-insured institutions withoutregard to size.3. Impact of the Proposed Rule on Small EntitiesThe Board believes that the proposed revision to procedures for processingsubordinated debt securities applications will not have a disparate effecton small entities. To the extent that under the revised regulations smallentities will more likely be able to file their applications at their districtFederal Home Loan Bank, the impact of the proposal will be liberalizing.4. Overlapping or Conflicting Federal RulesThere are no known federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict withthis proposal.5.
