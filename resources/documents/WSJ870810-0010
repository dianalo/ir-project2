The biggest dissenters are the buyout financiers themselves, who think the whole thing is getting out of hand.    James Freeman, an investment strategist at First Boston Corp., estimates that investors are contributing about $17 billion to at least 27 such new funds. Through the power of leverage, that translates into $140 billion in spending power, he figures.    &quot;The vast majority of these purchases will be publicly traded stocks,&quot; he says.    Leveraged buyouts -- in which an investor group buys a company largely with debt and plans to pay the debt from the company's operations or sales of its assets -- have contributed significantly to the stock market's surge of the past few years.    Such companies as Beatrice, Lear-Siegler, Owens-Illinois and many others have been taken private in leveraged buyouts -- at premiums to their previous stock prices. And many publicly traded stocks have risen in value on their possible appeal as buyout candidates.    Once this additional &quot;freight train full of money&quot; starts rolling, the next series of LBOs is bound to spur overall equity prices, Mr. Freeman says. Or if the stock market should falter for technical reasons, &quot;this money should underpin the market,&quot; he says.    Mr. Freeman does leave an out: If fundamental economic conditions should worsen, all that buyout money might not be spent.    But some of the biggest freight trains of buyout money are being driven with one hand on the brake.    &quot;It's a very pricey market,&quot; Lionel Pincus, a general partner in Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co., a venture banking firm that is active in leveraged buyouts, says. &quot;That makes it a little more difficult to do things.&quot;    Warburg Pincus raised nearly $1.2 billion in a fund in February, part of which can go for leveraged buyouts. But Mr. Pincus says the firm continues to be just as interested in other areas, such as venture capital and providing cash infusions for ailing companies.    &quot;When you see people paying three times what a company is worth, we don't want to play,&quot; Ted Forstmann, head of Forstmann Little andamp; Co., says. Having just amassed a $2.7 billion buyout fund, Mr. Forstmann insists that his chief objective is to make money for the investors. He says equity partners have earned an average of 102% a year in Forstmann's funds over the past 9 1/2 years. But he says many other funds &quot;are in the game to make fees for themselves.&quot;    &quot;With the Sandamp;P 400 industrials already selling at 24 times trailing earnings, the question is how much farther the market can be driven up by a bunch of idiots trying to create fees&quot; by doing LBOs, Mr. Forstmann says. He has serious doubts that still more leveraged buyouts will have any significant bullish effect on the stock market.    Investors in buyout funds generally are attracted by the extraordinary returns that leveraged buyouts have shown in recent years. Five years of recession-free growth have helped earnings of the companies that conduct the buyouts, while declining interest rates have cut their borrowing costs. This in turn has brought big gains in valuations of these companies.    Equity investors in leveraged buyout funds have often earned 60% to 100% a year, and even subordinated debt investors have earned 20% to 40%.    But such favorable conditions are hardly likely to continue forever, as a partner in charge of mergers and acquisitions at a major Wall Street firm notes.    &quot;This is a great time to raise LBO money,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's a terrible time to do deals.&quot;    Mr. Pincus says he also is concerned about the glut of leveraged buyout money.    &quot;I wouldn't have expected it (the availability of money in a bull market) to go on as long as it has,&quot; he says. But he says he thinks it still has a little longer to run before finally fizzling.    ---                   CASH FOR BUYOUTS                                        Estimated Size    Sponsor                             (in millions)    Kohlberg Kravis Roberts             $3,000-5,000    Forstmann Little                           2,700    Lazard Freres                              1,500*    Warburg Pincus                             1,175*    Equitable Bridge                           1,000    Equitable Life --      mezzanine finance                        1,000    Fort Worth Partners                        1,000    Thomas H.
