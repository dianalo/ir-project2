The action Wednesday against reporters from a country withimportant links to Cuba appeared to underscore Cuban frustration atworsening ties with Moscow, which has cut aid to Havana and istrying to force Castro to embrace reforms.   ``They told us we were expelled from Cuba and we had to leavetoday,'' said Televisa reporter Jose Eduardo Campos during a liveinterview on a late-night edition of the private network's Eco newsprogam.   Campos said Cuban officials expressed anger over an Eco reportfrom Moscow quoting a critical report about Castro and his brotherin the Soviet daily Pravda. He did not give a date or other detailsof the Pravda article.   ``They explained to us that the work we had done in Havana hadbeen to their liking.'' Campos said. But because of the Moscowreport, ``the television Eco was lying ... and that Eco was notgoing to be received in Havana.''   Anchorman Jacobo Zabludovsky said the report from Moscow``simply was limited to a textual translation of what waspublished'' in Pravda, the official Soviet Communist Partynewspaper.   Castro, a hard-line communist, has criticized Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's endorsemehnt of market-oriented reform.Massive Soviet aid to Cuba has been scaled back.   Campos said he and camera crew members Roberto Ruvalcabo andGuillermo Gomez had arrived in Havana on Saturday and worked``without any problem'' until they were summoned to the ForeignMinistry at midday Wednesday.   Ruvalcabo said officials told them ``that we were undesirablepersons'' and that they used the word ``deported'' when the crewwas loaded on a plane for Mexico.   Televisa operates four broadcast channels in Mexico City alone,with other channels elsewhere in Mexico. It also carries additionalprograms over cable. Eco broadcasts on one channel or another 24hours a day.   Such action against a major pro-government Mexican news outletis surprising because Mexico is one of Cuba's most importantfriends.   Mexican officials for many years have resisted U.S. attempts toisolate Cuba in pan-American organizations, and they havemaintained air and sea links with the island nation.</TEXT></DOC>
