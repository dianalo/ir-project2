(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lisa PicarilleandM;MicroPress Inc. has tapped the combined strength of two of itsfont-generation programs to let WordPerfect users directly access scalablefonts on demand.andM;NewFase II, due for release by the end of the month, eliminates thecumbersome process of loading memory-intensive typefaces from a hard disk,exiting WordPerfect to select a font and then reloading the word-processingsoftware, explained Michael Vulis, president of the Forest Hills, N.Y.,andO;company.andM;NewFase II's combination of features means users don't have to exit the wordprocessor before choosing from any of its 10 scalable fonts or scientific andengineering fonts in sizes from 5 to 100 points.andM;The software blends the point-size options of earlier NewFase type libraries,which offered users fixed point sizes on disk, with the font-generationabilities of the firm's Font! package.andM;The result is software that pushes WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 even closer todesktop-publishing status, particularly because NewFase offers a wide rangeof printer options, working with dot-matrix and laser printers, as well asPostScript-compatible units, early users said.andM;These NewFase II beta testers applauded in particular the program'ssimplified approach to a cumbersome task.andM;&quot;This product is efficient -- there's no wasted time calling for fonts,&quot; saidLev Neymotin, a mechanical engineer at Brookhaven National Laboratory, agovernment research lab in Upton, N.Y.andP;  &quot;You define the size and thetypeface, and the program generates it right there,&quot; added Neymotin, who iscurrently using NewFase with WordPerfect to create reports.andM;The NewFase II library of fonts uses compression algorithms, thus alleviatingworries about hefty storage requirements that frequently accompanydownloadable, fixed-point-size fonts, Vulis said.andM;NewFase II's roman font, for example, occupies only 38K bytes of memory,while a similar set of fonts would require about 200M bytes of space, headded.andM;MicroPress is planning versions of NewFase that will support MicrosoftCorp.'s Microsoft Word and WordStar International's WordStar, according toVulis.andM;However, Vulis would not supply a time frame for the forthcoming upgrades.andM;NewFase II runs on IBM PCs, ATs, XTs, PS/2s and compatibles, and requires DOS3.0 or higher and 640K bytes of memory.andP;  It will be offered at anintroductory price of $149 through March 1.andP;  After that, the program willretail for $399.andM;Cyrillic and Greek fonts are also available from the company at additionalcost.andM;MicroPress can be reached at (718) 575-1816.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
