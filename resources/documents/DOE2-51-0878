<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-0878 </DOCNO><TEXT>The propagation, confinement, and total energy of energetic (andgt;25 keV)electrons in solar flares are examined through a brief review of thefollowing hard x-ray measurements: (1) spatially resolved observationsobtained by imaging instruments; (2) stereoscopic observations of partiallyocculted sources providing radial (vertical) spatial resolution; and(3) directivity of the emission measured through stereoscopic observationsand the center-to-limb variation of the occurrence frequency of hardX ray flares. The characteristics of the energetic electrons are foundto be quite distinct in impulsive and gradual hard x-ray flares. In impulsiveflares, the nonthermal electron spectrum seems to extend down to about2 keV indicating that the total energy of nonthermal electrons is muchlarger than that assumed in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
