In late September, The Wall Street Journal invited a quartet of well-regarded investment experts to help launch the new Investment Dartboard column. The experts picked their favorite stocks for the month of October. Meanwhile, three Journal staffers and a visiting professor hurled darts at a list of New York Stock Exchange stocks and recorded the names of four stocks pierced by pure chance.    Guess which stock-picking method produced better results?    The dartboard portfolio rose 0.7% in October, while the pros' recommendations declined an average of 2.5%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7%. The specific stocks picked -- or pricked are listed in the table.    Such a small-scale, short-term test doesn't really mean much by itself, of course. But Investment Dartboard will appear from time to time, and if the results continue to favor the darts, they will provide new ammunition to advocates of the &quot;efficient market theory.&quot;    The theory holds that all available information is quickly reflected in stock prices, and therefore all stocks present equal chances for a gain. As a result, expertise doesn't matter. When it comes to picking stocks, an amateur has as much of a chance of selecting winners as a securities expert does.    The theory enjoys a wide academic following. Burton Malkiel, professor of economics at Princeton University and a well-known advocate of the theory, threw out the first dart at the Journal's request. But it's anathema to professional money managers, whose livelihood depends on the idea that skill and experience lead to better stock picks and higher profits.    Testing theories isn't the only purpose of Investment Dartboard, though. It should also provide a new source of investment ideas for individual investors. The experts who do best will be invited back for return appearances. In the real world, of course, money managers aren't judged on the short-term performance of a single stock.    Among the first group of pros to go up against the darts, only Michael Murphy, editor of Overpriced Stock Service, showed a gain last month. He logged a 9.2% profit on his suggestion to sell short 20th Century Industries.    An investor who sells short borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping for a price decline. Eventually, the investor must buy shares to replace the borrowed ones. But if the stock has declined enough in the meantime, the investor profits.    Mr. Murphy now suggests short-selling Flight International Group, an Atlanta company that engages in mock aerial dogfights to help train Air Force and Navy pilots. In the trade, says Mr. Murphy, the company is jokingly known as &quot;Rent a Russian Air Force.&quot; Mr. Murphy's beef is with the company's accounting. He says the financial statements assume that the company's small jets will last 18 years. But that's &quot;way too long,&quot; he argues. &quot;They're flying these things 30 hard hours a week.&quot;    The other returning professional, Linda Newman, president of Atalanta Capital Corp., selects Kimberly-Clark Corp. Well-known for consumer brands such as Kleenex, Kotex and Huggies, Kimberly-Clark is also in several other businesses: newsprint, printing papers, specialty electronics, aircraft maintenance and commercial airline services. With so many diverse businesses that could be spun off or sold, Kimberly-Clark makes a tempting takeover or leveraged buy-out candidate, Ms. Newman believes.    New in the game this month is Nancy Zevenbergen, founder of Zevenbergen Capital Inc., a money management firm in Seattle. She recommends Fred Meyer Inc., a discount retailer based in Portland, Ore., that has about 100 stores in the Northwest. She says Fred Meyer has withstood tough competition from other discounters and sells at only nine times estimated 1989 earnings. She's also pleased that management owns a lot of stock, reasoning that it gives the managers &quot;a stronger commitment to the bottom line.&quot; The leveraged buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. took the company private, then brought it public again; KKR still owns about 60% of the stock.    The other new picker is Richard Evans, director of research at Dow Theory Forecasts, a Hammond, Ind., newsletter. Mr. Evans picks Citicorp, which he believes is over the worst of its foreign-loan problems. He notes that Citicorp stock sells for about five times its estimated 1988 per-share earnings, and has a dividend yield of nearly 6%. &quot;This will be a good stock to pit against some of the racehorses,&quot; Mr. Evans says. &quot;This is definitely a plowhorse.&quot;    For November, the pros will be up against a new quartet of dartboard picks: Champion Spark Plug Co., Kansas City Power andamp; Light Co. Series D preferred, M/A-Com Inc. and Texas Eastern Corp.    ---               The Contestants for Round Two    Linda Newman,                BUY: KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP.    Atalanta Capital Corp.
