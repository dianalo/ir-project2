Forecasts of continuing cold weather in the Northeast spurredbuying of wholesale home heating oil.   Despite the rebound, the renewed buying in the energy futurespits was restrained because traders still were downcast about thenew OPEC production agreement. The cartel's higher output ceilingis expected to weigh on prices.   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, made up less than half of Tuesday's38-cent loss. It rose 15 cents to close at $19.40 per 42-gallonbarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for deliveryin February through April finished with smaller gains.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,No.2 heating oil for December delivery rose 0.30 cent to 60.61cents a gallon after falling 0.61 cent on Tuesday. The Januarythrough March contracts ended with larger increases.   Mary Haskins, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst, saidexpectations of an extended cold snap on the East Coast and inother parts of the country probably boosted heating oil demandslightly. For much of the autumn, unusually mild temperaturescaused a buildup in heating oil stocks in the Northeast.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery finished 0.19cent higher at 49.72 cents a gallon, erasing a small portion ofTuesday's drop of 1.36 cents. Contracts for later delivery postedlarger gains.   Energy market analysts said traders still were preoccupied withthe outcome of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'winter conference.   At a meeting in Vienna, ministers from the cartel's 13 membersagreed to raise their self-imposed daily production limit to 22million barrels for the first half of next year from the current20.5 million barrels.   Other than the OPEC developments, there was little news fortraders to act on. The energy markets had slumped Tuesday on wordof the OPEC agreement. The selling may have been overdone andWednesday's modest recovery was described by traders as a technicalcorrection.</TEXT></DOC>
