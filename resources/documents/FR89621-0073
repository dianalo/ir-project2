The others concern pricing of overdrafts on the Federal Reserve'swire transfer system (``Fedwire'') and related overdraft measurement andcaps proposals (Docket No. R-0668), as well as the inclusion of book-entrysecurities transfers in the measurement of Fedwire overdrafts (Docket No.R-0669). The Board encourages all interested parties to comment on eachof these proposals. The Board urges that in filing comments on these proposals,commenters prepare separate letters for each proposal, identifying theappropriate docket number on each. This procedure will facilitate the Board'sprocessing and analysis of the comments on these proposals by ensuringthat each comment is quickly brought to the attention of those responsiblefor analyzing each specific proposal. In addition, the Board encouragesentities that plan to submit identical comments, such as affiliated institutionswithin a holding company, to consolidate their efforts; the Board willgive equal consideration to one letter signed by a number of commentersas it would to numerous identical letters submitted by those commenters.Comments are due November 17, 1989, and the Board does not intend to extendthe comment period beyond that date.In addition to its requests for comment, the Board is also issuing todaythree risk-related policy statements regarding private delivery-against-paymentsystems (Docket No. R-0665), offshore clearing and netting systems (DocketNo. R-0666), and rollovers and continuing contracts (Docket No. R-0667).In April 1985, the Board of Governors adopted a policy to reduce risk onlarge-dollar payments systems. This policy, which was implemented in March1986, established a maximum amount of intraday funds overdrafts that depositoryinstitutions are permitted to incur over both Fedwire and private large-dollarpayments systems. The maximum, or cap, is a multiple of a depository institution'sadjusted primary capital and is based on a self-evaluation of a depositoryinstitution's creditworthiness, credit policies, and operational controls.In July 1987, the Board adopted a number of modifications to the daylightoverdraft policy, including a two-step, 25 percent reduction in the cross-systemnet debit caps, thus reducing the maximum daylight overdrafts permittedto individual depository institutions.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These reductions became effective in January and May 1988.See 52 FR 29255 (August 6, 1987).The Board has applied its daylight overdraft policy to foreign banks aswell as domestic institutions in a manner consistent with the policy of``national treatment,'' i.e., applying similar rules to foreign entitiesoperating within the United States as are applied to domestic institutions.In this regard, U.S. subsidiary banks owned by foreign banks are treatedidentically to all other U.S. banks under the program. The policy for branchesand agencies of foreign banks, however, of necessity, takes into accountcertain differences between these entities and domestically-chartered institutions,including the following: (1) Most of a foreign bank's assets and liabilitiesare located and controlled outside of the United States and only the operationsof the U.S. branches and agencies are subject to supervisory review byU.S. authorities, and (2) for many foreign banks, the volume of dollarpayments that would flow through their U.S. branch network is substantialrelative to the level of their assets in the United States and their localdollar funding capacity. As such, there may be practical limits on theability of branches and agencies of foreign banks to raise funds in themarket, either through unsecured borrowings or by providing collateralin an acceptable form, to meet liquidity needs in the event of credit oroperational problems.In this initial policy, the Board based the cross-system cap (for Fedwireand CHIPS \2\<NOTE/> combined) for branches of foreign banks on their world-widecapital, but based the Fedwire cap (for Fedwire funds overdrafts) on asurrogate for capital in the U.S. (``U.S. capital equivalency'' \3\<NOTE/>), which is significantly smaller than world-wide capital.Foreign banks with U.S. branches and agencies are permitted to incur Fedwireoverdrafts above their Fedwire caps (up to the cross-system cap) by postingcollateral for the amount of such overdrafts in excess of their Fedwirecaps.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``CHIPS'' is the Clearing House Interbank Payments System,operated by the New York Clearing House.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ U.S. capital equivalency is defined as the greater of(1) the sum of the amount of capital (but not surplus) that would be requiredof a national bank being organized at each branch or agency location or(2) the sum of 5 percent of the total liabilities of each branch or agency,including acceptances, but excluding (a) accrued expenses and (b) amountsdue and other liabilities to offices, branches, and subsidiaries of theforeign bank.A few foreign banks operating through U.S. branches and agencies have indicatedthat Fedwire caps are too binding for their dollar payments business, thattheir Fedwire caps do not recognize their world-wide strength, and thattheir U.S. operations do not involve the kind of assets to permit the postingof collateral for larger Fedwire overdrafts. In the summer of 1987, theBoard reconsidered its policy in light of these concerns and determinedthat the policy should not be changed. This decision was based in parton the fact that U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were generallyoperating well within their Fedwire caps and seemed to be able to obtainlarge volumes of private intraday credit on CHIPS. Foreign bank representatives have noted that the Basle Accord capital standardsshould meet or alleviate the Board's concerns about the capital positionsand supervision of foreign banks with U.S. branches and agencies. In early1989, the Institute of International Bankers renewed its request that theBoard permit world-wide capital to be used as the base for determiningFedwire caps for foreign banks operating in the U.S. through branches andagencies. There continues to be little evidence, however, that foreign banks areseriously constrained in their access to U.S. payments systems, despiterapid growth in their overdrafts. Since the Board's policy was initiated,both Fedwire funds and CHIPS daily average peak overdrafts of U.S. branchesand agencies of foreign banks have risen more rapidly than have those ofU.S.-chartered entities. In the fourth quarter of 1988, 64 branches oragencies of foreign banks incurred $6.4 billion of Fedwire funds overdrafts,and 96 incurred $31.0 billion of CHIPS net debits. Very few of these entitiesuse their Fedwire cap intensively, however the few who do exceed theirFedwire cap under the proposed policy would have to collateralize the totalamount of their Fedwire overdraft. The Board does not believe that the current daylight overdraft policy iscausing a hardship for foreign banks. Moreover, given the lack of U.S.asset base and potential limits on dollar funding capacity that would applyto some foreign banks, the current policy appears to be sound. Includingbook-entry overdrafts under the cap policy (see Docket No. R-0669) wouldhave virtually no impact on the Fedwire cap utilization of foreign banksoperating through U.S. branches and agencies. However, the proposed collateralpolicy for book-entry overdrafters requires that collateral be posted byU.S.-chartered depository institutions for all Fedwire overdrafts if theFedwire cap is exceeded because of book-entry overdrafts. A parallel policyfor those U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that exceed theirFedwire cap based on U.S. capital equivalency would provide that collateralbe posted equal to the total Fedwire overdrafts, not just the amount inexcess of the cap. The current policy that permits U.S. branches and agenciesof foreign banks to incur uncollateralized Fedwire overdrafts up to theirFedwire cap based on U.S. capital equivalency would not be changed. Underthe proposal, foreign banks could have Fedwire overdrafts up to the amountof their cap multiplied by their world-wide capital if all of those overdraftswere collateralized. At the current time, such a policy change would have virtually no impacton foreign banks, which use CHIPS much more than Fedwire and have relativelylow Fedwire cap utilization rates. Such a change would also serve as betterprotection for Reserve Banks if large exposures do occur. Accordingly, the Board is soliciting public comment on a proposal thatwould extend the collateral requirements to all Fedwire overdrafts (fundsand book-entry) of foreign banks operating through U.S. branches and agenciesif such overdrafts exceed their Fedwire cap. The Board also requests commenton the proposed general overdraft policy (see Docket No. R-0668) as itapplies to these entities.\4\ <NOTE/> Specifically, the Board is requesting comment on the relativeburdens and benefits of the proposed collateral policy versus maintainingthe current policy (but including book-entry overdrafts in the total Fedwireoverdrafts subject to cap). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Edge corporations would continue, as now, to be requiredto post collateral for all their Fedwire overdrafts. No change in policyis being proposed for these entities. The Board is also requesting comment on alternative definitions of U.S.capital equivalency, particularly in light of the recent internationalaccord on the definition of bank capital. Commenters are asked to suggestalternative definitions that would provide a reasonable balance betweenthe practical U.S. asset and dollar liquidity limits of foriegn banks andthe interests of foreign banks in more flexible access to Fedwire. <ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,June 15, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
