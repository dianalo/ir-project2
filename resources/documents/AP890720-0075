(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strikes by tens of thousands ofminers in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of theSoviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.   The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the farnorth, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and theUkrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.   Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia todayrefused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, homeof the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at astandstill.   Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking minersin the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greaterlocal control over their industries and better wages and livingconditions.   Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, arethe country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to thecountry's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is amajor city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strikes began 10 daysago.   The government has acknowledged that living and workingconditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has madegeneral pledges of improvements.   Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returnedto work after the government made pay concessions.   The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter,sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortagesin the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper KomsomolskayaPravda said today.   But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in theUkraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in theDonetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, ``The scale of the strike isgrowing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city havestopped work.''   Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off thejob on Wednesday, Tass said.   In Vorkuta, strikers sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for an``urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of thecoal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the farnorth,'' Tass said.   In Rostov, miners' economic demands included extra pay forevening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in theprice of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.   In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers'demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.   In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incompletenews accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, accordingto Tass.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes couldimperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workersbeing urged to strike.   He said that if labor trouble spreads, ``We may have to take suchextreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' tooverhaul the economy through greater attention to free-marketmechanisms.   He did not elaborate.   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by forcebefore Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.   Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached ``a turningpoint,'' with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.   It was not known how many more employees were back on the jobtoday. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 strikers in Kuznetsk wereback at work and 150,000 remained on strike.   State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetskbasin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple theprevious number, and that mine construction workers had joined.   In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television saidsteel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''for lack of coal.   Earlier reports in the official press had said operations atsteel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal andcoke.   Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that thestrikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.   The government has agreed to most miner demands, including thoseon pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settlingsome longer-term issues would take up to a month.   Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay tonight shifts and for men using jackhammers.   Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages ofconsumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledgesof improvements in those areas.</TEXT></DOC>
