FredBergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.   He said the effort launched by the United States and thegovernments of Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada andItaly had failed to keep the dollar from rising this year above theupper targets set by the world's richest industrial countries.   That will spell trouble down the road as American exporters findthat the higher value of the dollar makes it more difficult to selltheir goods abroad, Bergsten said at a news conference.   He forecast that the U.S. trade deficit, which improveddramatically in 1988, will begin rising again by 1990, furtherworsening the country's position as the world's largest debtornation.   The institute today released a new book, ``Dollar Politics:Exchange Rate Policymaking in the United States,'' which called forincreased emphasis by U.S. policymakers both in the executive branchand in Congress on the dollar's proper level on foreign currencymarkets.   ``In May and June (the dollar) shattered its upper limit againstthe yen _ 140 (yen to one dollar) _ and the mark _ 1.90-1.92 (marksto one dollar), rising above 150 and 2.00, respectively, to a2{-year high,'' wrote I.M. Destler and C. Randall Henning, theauthors of the new study.   Destler is professor in the School of Public Affairs at theUniversity of Maryland and Henning is a research associate at theinstitute, a private study group with financing from the UnitedStates and other countries.   The price of the dollar is important because of its effect ontrade. A low dollar makes U.S. goods cheap, encouraging exports anddiscouraging imports. A rise in the dollar has the opposite effect.   Governments, including the Bush administration, agree that thiscountry buys far too much in comparison with what it sells. Theresulting trade deficit has made the United States the world'sbiggest debtor nation.   On Friday the price of the dollar was above 146 yen and 1.99marks, despite efforts to keep it down. One report said the centralbanks of 10 countries had been selling dollars in an unsuccessfulattempt to keep their price down.   A 1985 agreement to work together on the price of the dollar andother currencies was made by Secretary of State James A. Baker III _then secretary of the Treasury _ and his counterparts from Japan,West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.   They have never published their targets for the dollar's price.The upper limits named by Destler and Henning are often cited byunofficial experts.   The two authors complained that U.S. exchange rate policy is madeby a small group of senior officials and should be more closelycoordinated with broader economic policies and private business.   They proposed setting up new committees in Congress to watch thedollar's price, a private sector group to advise Treasury SecretaryNicholas F. Brady, and more involvement by other government agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
