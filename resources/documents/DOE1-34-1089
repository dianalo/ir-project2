The catalystis the one prepared by getting nickel and molybdenum supported on thecarrier of porous alumina in which zeolite is dispersed. The relationshipbetween the components of catalyst and the activity was investigatedusing the circulating solvent for Wandoan coal liquefaction sampled fromthe 1 t/d-PDU. The hydrocracking activity of C{sub 22}{sup +} n-paraffinswas improved by increasing the content of zeolite in the high-silicazeolite selected in FY 1985. Alumina was selected as the carrier matrixin which zeolite is dispersed. The average particle diameter of the aluminaproviding the maximum activity for the hydrogenation and the decompositionof C{sub 22}{sup +} n-paraffins was determined. The characteristics ofhydrogenation and decomposition of n-paraffins were improved by increasingthe supported amounts of nickel and molybdenum.</TEXT></DOC>
