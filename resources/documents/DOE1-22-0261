<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0261 </DOCNO><TEXT>One-loop amplitudes of O(N) open superstring with emission of massivebosons are studied. Divergences appearing at {lambda} = 0 ({lambda}:the over-all Teichmueller parameter) are shown to be canceled if N =32 just as in the massless case. We explicitly evaluate the two-pointon-shell amplitudes for all the levels of bosons lying on the leading(m/sup 2/ = 2 l, J = l + 1, m:mass J:spin l:level number of an excitedstate) and the next-to-leading (m/sup 2/ = 2 l, J = l) Regge trajectoriesand observe that they are nonvanishing even at N = 32. This implies thatO(32) open super-string one-loop amplitudes with massive bosons generallysuffer from external-line divergences. Further the obtained expressionsof on-shell self energies (mass shifts {delta}m/sup 2/(l)) seem to havenontrivial dependences on l (being not proportional to l), although massdegeneracies remain. This strongly suggests that the Regge trajectoriesform a set of parallel polygonal lines at one-loop level so that themass shifts cannot be absorbed by the shift of the slope parameter. Thedivergences would have to be cured by the vertex operator renormalizationsat every excited level.</TEXT></DOC>
