Six Bankers Trust executives or directors sold sharessince Jan. 30, according to the filings. The officials sold atotal of 45,815 shares at an average price of $44.18, for atotal of $2 million.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman said most of the shares sold were earned bythe executives based on 1987 performance, but carried aprovision that restricted their sale until January 1991.&quot;You'll probably be seeing more&quot; insider selling at BankersTrust because an increasing proportion of the company'semployee compensation is paid in stock, he said.   The largest insider sale was by Terence Mogan, a managingdirector of the corporate finance department. His sale of12,877 shares for $579,465 on Feb. 6 represented 84% of hisholdings, SEC filings show. Mr. Mogan couldn't be reached tocomment. Edward Lesser, an executive vice president, sold11,816 shares, representing 14% of his holdings, the filingsshow. Mr. Lesser declined to comment.   The other four Bankers Trust insiders sold sharesrepresenting 13% to 100% of their stakes, the SEC filingsshow.   Bankers Trust reported a 22% jump in net income in lastyear's fourth quarter, and posted record earnings for theyear. But the company warned the recession would probablylower results in 1991.   Bankers Trust closed yesterday at $47, up $1, in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading.   At Republic New York, SEC filings show that seven insiderssold shares since Jan. 1. All told, the seven trimmed theirholdings by 15,468 shares, valued at $883,610 on the basis ofyesterday's close of $57.125 in Big Board composite trading.The stock gained 62.5 cents yesterday.   The insiders' shares fetched slightly less, $48 to $53 ashare, the SEC filings show.   The open-market sales followed a corporate stock buy-backprogram, executed on the last day of December, in whichseveral insiders sold stock back to the company at $49.13 ashare. Four of the executives who sold shares then, soldagain a month later in the open market, often at lower shareprices, SEC filings show.   For example, Rick Friedlander, an executive vice presidentwho sold 2,790 shares in the company buy-back program, sold2,100 shares in January, SEC filings show. The two salestrimmed his total holdings 35%, the filings show.   The largest open-market sale was by Thomas Weiner, anofficer of the company, who sold 5,500 shares at an averageprice of $48.72, or a total of $267,960, according to SECfilings. The shares represented 84% of his direct holdings inRepublic New York, the filings show.   The company's corporate counsel, J. Phillip Burgess,declined to comment or to confirm SEC figures. Mr.Friedlander and Mr. Weiner couldn't be reached.   ---   REGIONAL REBOUND?: In a week that was largely bereft ofinsiders making sizable bets on their company's stock, thelargest purchase reported to the SEC was made by Robert E.Torray, a Chicago pension-fund manager who serves as adirector of Banks of Mid-America Inc.   SEC filings show Mr. Torray paid $251,075 for 33,300shares of Banks of Mid-America, the Oklahoma City holdingcompany for First Tulsa and Liberty of Oklahoma banks. Thepurchases -- three of them made from Dec. 4 through Jan. 30at an average share price of $7.53 -- increased his holdingsa modest 2%, the filings show. Mr. Torray said he has sincebought 40,000 more shares, a purchase that has yet to appearin SEC filings.   Mr. Torray said he was among a group of investors thatcompletely recapitalized the holding company in October 1988.At that time, the company was in serious trouble, he said,with regional property values, collateral values and incomelevels falling. Now, he said &quot;there's been a gradualimprovement in the Oklahoma economy&quot; and he sees Banks ofMid-America stock as a bargain at its close yesterday of $8,up 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
