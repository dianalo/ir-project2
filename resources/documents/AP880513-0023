Members of Congress are also concerned about the FCC's proposal,but their fear is that it goes too far in loosening the regulatoryreins on telephone companies.   The FCC on Thursday unveiled a plan to lift limits on theprofits that ATandamp;T can earn on interstate phone calls and that localphone companies can earn on their charges for long-distancecompanies to connect to the local phone network. Instead, thecompanies' prices would be capped.   The FCC estimated that a price-cap strategy over four yearswould save consumers $1.6 billion over what they would otherwisepay under the current form of earnings regulation.   The FCC's three sitting commissioners agreed the proposed methodwould give the companies incentive to cut costs, invest in moreefficient technology and be more innovative in order to maximizetheir earnings.   ATandamp;T said it was encouraged by the proposal, but expressedinitial concern that some of the proposed changes could be moreburdensome than current regulation. Spokesman Herb Linnen said thecompany was concerned it might ``have less flexibility than we havenow, including in lowering prices.''   ATandamp;T, which as the industry leader is the only long-distancecompany under government regulation, has been pressing the FCC formore latitude in setting rates. Other long-distance carriers settheir rates at levels competitive with ATandamp;T.   Current regulation restricts ATandamp;T from earning more than 12.2percent and the local Bell phone companies from earning more than12 percent on their interstate business. The companies determinetheir prices under these earnings constraints.   Under the proposal, rates would be capped beginning April 1,1989, and companies opting for price caps would be required to cutrates to reflect a projected productivity increase of 3 percenteach year. After four years, the plan would be reviewed.   Most of the seven regional Bell holding companies, whilesupporting the price-cap concept, said the productivity factor istoo ambitious.   ``For the local exchange carriers (LECs) to break even underprice caps, the commission's plan would require LECs to almostdouble their recent productivity levels,'' BellSouth said in astatement.   NYNEX called the productivity goal ``potentially unrealistic,''and Bell Atlantic said it was ``a very challenging productivitycommitment.''   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second-largestlong-distance carrier, said price caps should not extend to theBell companies at all. MCI, fearing an increase in Bell charges foraccess to local phone networks, said the Bell companies control thelocal phone networks, and so should continue under the current``monopoly'' regulation of their profits.   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the new method would eliminateincentives inherent in profit regulation for phone companies to padexpenses and use revenues from regulated businesses to subsidizeunregulated operations.   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman ofthe panel's telecommunciations subcommittee, said they ``continueto be concerned that ordinary telephone customers will be worse offunder this new plan than they would be under an intelligentadministration of the current system.''   The FCC first proposed a rate-cap plan last August, but underpressure from Congress, the commission decided to fine-tune theproposal by adding details. Commissioners could vote on the plan byfall, following a three-month period for public comment.</TEXT></DOC>
