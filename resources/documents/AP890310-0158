More than 2,000 undocumented aliens were crammed into dormitoriesand tents Friday at the Immigration and Naturalization Service'sminimum-security Port Isabel Service Processing Center, 20 milesnortheast of the border city of Brownsville.   ``I think there is an increase in tension,'' said INS spokeswomanVirginia Kice. ``Our (detainee) population has increased fivefold inthe past two weeks.''   Mark Schneider, an immigration attorney, said evidence of thetension includes fistfights and ethnic slurs among the detainees.   Earlier this week, INS officials stopped allowing reporters andphotographers into the 315-acre compound to avoid increasing ``thelevel of excitement,'' Ms. Kice said.   ``Our population is high, and our first responsiblity is thewelfare of our detainees and personnel,'' the INS spokeswoman said,but added there had not been any violence at the center.   The detainee population for months remained below 450 at therural facility before the crackdown on asylum applicants tookeffect. On Feb. 21, the INS started a speeded-up procedure in whichasylum-seekers applications are processed quickly and those deniedrefugee status are arrested and detained. Unless they appeal theirdenial of asylum, detainees face quick deportation.   Schneider, who visited clients at the center Thursday night,said: ``The atmosphere is tense. People are vocally demanding morefood and medicine.''   ``The overcrowding and the lack of information are making peoplenervous,'' he said.   Seventy Central Americans who were rejected for asylum here underthe new measures and did not appeal have been flown back to ElSalvador, Guatemala and Honduras since Sunday when the deportationsbegan, Ms. Kice said.   ``We have not deported any Nicaraguans,'' she said. ``The Meesedirective still stands.''   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese in July 1987 issued adirective calling for special treatment of Nicaraguan politicalasylum cases, and for INS officials to ``encourage and expedite''their applications for work authorization. Under the directive, fewNicaraguans have been deported unless they had criminal records,because the INS considers Marxist-ruled Nicaragua a totalitariannation.   The INS Harlingen District at Texas' southern tip is referringcases of Nicaraguans denied asylum to the Justice Department inWashington.   Of 473 asylum applications processed here since Feb. 21, only 36had been approved as of Friday morning, and 35 of the 36 people wereNicaraguans. The other was a Salvadoran.   The INS began the get-tough measures in southern Texas todiscourage ``frivolous'' asylum applicants from traveling to theUnited States, INS officials said.   Political asylum is granted to those able to convince the federalgovernment that they are fleeing persecution. The INS maintains mostCentral Americans come here for economic reasons and do not meritpolitical-refugee status, though critics say that the agency is tooquick to deny asylum from politically torn nations such as ElSalvador whose governments, unlike Nicaragua, are friendly to theUnited States.   More than 40,000 Central Americans have initiated asylum cases insouthern Texas after crossing the Rio Grande illegally since lastspring. Before Feb. 21, the INS allowed applicants not previouslyapprehended by the Border Patrol to travel to their U.S.destinations to pursue asylum claims.   In addition to the more than 2,000 adults in detention atBayview, including nearly 400 in tents, the Justice Department hadmore than 900 other people in custody at a Brownsville American RedCross shelter for family groups.</TEXT></DOC>
