Most of the 20 consultants were former Housing and UrbanDevelopment employees or well-connected Republicans, said a reportby HUD Inspector General Paul Adams. The consultants were paid bydevelopers to help them get about one-fifth of the money from a HUDprogram to repair housing for the poor.   Adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtainingfunds from HUD, but the new report is the first attempt todetermine the extent and expense of the practice.   Under the HUD program, developers were eligible for tax creditsand could get HUD to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwisecouldn't afford it.   In all, 51 projects with a total of 7,268 apartments fundedsince October 1983 used consultants, Adams' report found. Thataccounts for about 20 percent of all HUD's work in this area duringthat time.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department is weighing whetherWilliam Lucas could be named chief civil rights enforcer on aninterim basis after his rejection by the Democrat-dominated SenateJudiciary Committee.

Space shuttle reliability to date, with one catastrophic failurein 29 launches _ the 1986 explosion of Challenger _ is 96.5 percentand a contractor estimated last year that a representative chanceof mission success is 98 percent. The price of increased spaceactivity includes ``the likelihood that loss of life will occur,''the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
