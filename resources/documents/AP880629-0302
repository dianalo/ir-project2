Boesky was transferred from a minimum-security prison camp inLompoc, Calif., to the Metropolitan Correctional Facility inManhattan June 23, Joseph Fitzmaurice, a Lompoc correctionalofficer, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.   Robert Palmquist, a paralegal specialist in the warden's officeat Lompoc, said marshals accompanied Boesky on a federal writ. Thatmeans Boesky was likely to testify in an unspecified proceeding.   The officials said they did not know the exact reason for thetransfer, although Palmquist said it was temporary.   ``He will eventually come back to this facility,'' Palmquistsaid.   Federal prosecutors in New York said they could not comment onthe transfer. Asked if he could explain why Boesky was moved,assistant U.S. attorney John Carroll said, ``No, I can't.''   Boesky attorneys Theodore Levine and Robert McCaw were out oftheir Washington office Tuesday and could not be reached forcomment, a secretary there said.   Boesky stunned the financial world in November 1986 by payingthe Securities and Exchange Commission a record $100 million tosettle charges of insider trading, the misuse of confidentialinformation to profit from securities transactions.   He agreed to cooperate in a major government probe into WallStreet corruption and has supplied extensive information that hasimplicated others. In exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to asingle criminal charge of conspiracy to lie to the SEC and receiveda three-year prison term in December. He began serving the term inMarch at Lompoc, a former U.S. army barracks about 140 mileswest-northwest of Los Angeles.   In April, Boesky's attorneys asked U.S. District Judge MorrisLasker, who sentenced Boesky, to reduce the punishment on groundsthat the speculator's cooperation was much broader and deeper thanoriginally foreseen.   In a lengthy written plea for leniency, the attorneys said thevalue of the information provided by Boesky ``will become een moreevident than it was at sentencing, or than it can be now.''   Boesky's cooperation has resulted in more than 19 criminal andcivil cases, including four convictions in the United States, sevenpending indictments in Britain, nine SEC civil actions and morethan $134 million in returned profits and penalties, the lawyersargued.   They also asked Lasker to withhold a decision on their pleauntil October, which suggested that new indictments stemming fromBoesky's disclosures could result by then.</TEXT></DOC>
