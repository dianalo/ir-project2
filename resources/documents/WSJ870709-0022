Early in the day the state-run Kuwait News Agency said there is a &quot;strong tendency&quot; among OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran and Libya, to support the price rise. The agency attributed the report to &quot;highly placed (Persian) Gulf oil sources.&quot;    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for August delivery rose 14 cents a barrel to $20.88.    At OPEC's meeting last month in Vienna, Austria, the cartel decided to maintain the current $18-a-barrel price, while limiting total production in the third and fourth quarters to 16.6 million barrels a day.    A major factor behind the reported pressure for a price increase is the decline in the dollar in recent months, analysts said. While export earnings of OPEC nations are dollar-denominated, nearly 80% of their imports are denominated in other currencies, estimated Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. As a result, their import costs are rising relative to their export revenues. An obvious remedy would be to raise the price of their primary export product, namely crude oil, he said.    Strong buying in the August contract just before the close of trading on the New York Merc heralded a &quot;continuation of the bull trend&quot; in oil futures, said Eric Bolling, vice president-futures and options at Gelderman Inc.    In addition to the unconfirmed reports from the Kuwait News Agency, inventory figures released after Tuesday's close of trading gave more support to rising crude prices than many traders initially expected, Mr. Bolling said.    The figures, released by the American Petroleum Institute, showed crude oil supplies for the week ended July 3 fell slightly to 324.1 million barrels from 325.6 million barrels the previous week.    Because many traders had been expecting a buildup in crude inventories for the week, Mr. Bolling said, the decline more than offset the negative impact of a buildup in distillate and gasoline supplies reported by the API.    &quot;The market doesn't seem like it wants to head south yet,&quot; Mr. Bolling said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Lighter-than-expected movement of hogs to slaughter and rumors of increasing demand for frozen pork bellies sent belly futures soaring. Contracts for summer delivery raced to lifetime highs, as both the July and August contract closed up the daily limit of $2 a hundredweight, or two cents a pound. The July hog contract also reached a high as slaughter declined. Although slaughter for this week &quot;started off with a bang,&quot; it is now 9% below that of a year earlier, said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Firmer cash prices also supported the hog market. Cattle futures finished lower amid sluggish demand for beef.    GRAINS AND SOYBEAN: Soybean and corn futures prices tumbled amid expectations of good crop yields and predictions of rain in the coming days. Soybeans for delivery after this fall's harvest had the sharpest declines, as scattered showers across the Midwest continue to dampen expectations of drought. &quot;Nobody is willing to own beans if conditions are so good out there,&quot; said Mickey Luth, a Shearson analyst in Chicago. Renewed rumors that the Commodity Credit Corp. may sell off-grade corn supplies also weighed against that market, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. The Agriculture Department denied the rumor. Still, because a release of the corn would increase supplies available to the market in the near term, the biggest declines were in contracts for summer delivery. Wheat was also lower.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices fell more than half a point, partly because of unconfirmed rumors that West Germany's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market to depress the dollar by selling the U.S. currency and buying West German marks, traders said. The long-term bond falls on negative news about the dollar but rises very little on positive reports, said Jeffrey Priest, head of taxable fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York. Other traders noted the Federal Reserve didn't drain reserves from the banking system yesterday as many had expected, leading some to believe that the Fed was easing its grip on the country's credit reins. Such &quot;unsnugging,&quot; said a trader marshalling the latest in Fed-watching argot, may have loosed another round of inflation fears among traders.    PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures prices led gold and platinum futures higher on a wave of buying mainly from commodity funds, or pools of professionally managed money, which were following price trends, traders and analysts said. &quot;This was almost exclusively a technical advance,&quot; said William O'Neill, director of research at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. Silver futures opened near their lows for the day, following weakness in European trading, then rallied sharply before giving up some of their gains later in the day. September silver closed 16.5 cents an ounce higher at $7.725. While gold futures, continuing a recent trend, lagged behind silver's gains, they nonetheless closed higher as the August contract rose 70 cents an ounce to $446.80. Platinum futures, benefiting from support from overseas buyers, also rose.    COFFEE: Futures prices rose in light trading. Much of the gains came when commercial traders were unable to push the market below $1 and those who earlier sold the market bought back in, said Debra Tropp, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. The gains in July coffee, which rose 1.39 cents a pound to $1.011, brought the contract back from Tuesday's six-year low. However, continued expectations that Brazil will have its largest crop in 20 years made &quot;traders unwilling to chase&quot; the market higher, Ms. Tropp said. </TEXT></DOC>
