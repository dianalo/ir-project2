(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After focusing for nearly a decade on thederegulation of their own industry, radio and television stationowners are turning their attention to competitive challenges fromcable TV, satellite programming and foreign technology.   Members of the industry will wrestle with issues likehigh-definition TV and carriage of local TV signals by cableoperators at the National Association of Broadcasters conventionthis week.   More than 40,000 broadcasters are expected to attend theconvention, which will include a visit from President Reagan, aformer radio broadcaster and friend of the industry.   Since Reagan took office in 1981, the Federal CommunicationsCommission has eased restrictions on buying and selling radio andTV stations, taken a relaxed view of mergers and acquisitions,reduced paperwork requirements and made license renewals easier.   ``Broadcasters feel he's one of us. He understands ourbusiness,'' said Wallace Jorgenson, president of Jefferson-PilotCommunications Co., Charlotte, N.C., and chairman of NAB's JointBoard.   Reagan, scheduled to speak at the convention Sunday, is toreceive an award from NAB for his leadership in broadcastcommunications.   The NAB also will present its distinguished service award, theindustry's highest honor, to former FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler,who carried out the administration's deregulatory agenda.   Though broadcasters have been pleased with deregulation, some inCongress feel it has gone too far, particularly with elimination ofthe fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to air conflictingsides of important issues.   The FCC's decision to scrap the policy angered Democrats inCongress and they have promised to try to revive it this year. Theyhave made it a top priority and have told broadcasters they willget no legislation they want until the doctrine is made law.   One of the things broadcasters want most is a requirement thatcable operators carry local TV signals. The courts struck downprevious ``must-carry'' rules.   Broadcasters are asking Congress for renewed protection of theirsignals, and some are willing to live with a fairness doctrine inexchange.   ``We broadcasters are sitting in the middle of a fight betweenthe FCC and Congress,'' Jorgenson said. ``Broadcasters have tolearn they are shooting real bullets at each other and we'd betterkeep our heads down right now.''   Another hot topic at this year's convention is high-definitionTV, called HDTV. The Japanese have a clear lead in developing thesuper-picture technology, but the system they plan to introduce intheir own country in 1990 relies upon direct satellitetransmissions to specially designed TV sets. Europeans also havechosen an HDTV system, but it is not compatible with the Japanesesystem.   The United States is much further behind, and the systems beingdeveloped are still in the computer-simulation stage. Onecomplication is the number of competing interests who have a stakein whichever system is ultimately chosen.   Broadcasters want to make sure that any U.S. industry standardfor HDTV is compatible with existing TV sets, so signals from localbroadcasters can still be received by the 140 million sets that arenow in American households.   They also see the possibility the Japanese could start sellingHDTV satellite receivers and video-cassette recorders in the UnitedStates, a prospect broadcasters fear could cut deeply into theiraudience.</TEXT></DOC>
