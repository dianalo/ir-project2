Officials of the world's second biggest computer maker saidWednesday they would introduce advanced workstations along with newsoftware and industry-standard personal computers in a major newsconference on Tuesday.   ``It's probably the most significant desktop announcement we'veever made,'' Donald McInnis, vice president of Digital's engineeringsystems group, said in a telephone interview.   Digital, the minicomputer giant based in Maynard, Mass., lost outon billions of dollars in potential revenue from personal computersbecause its founder and president, Kenneth Olsen, underestimated theimportance of the machines.   The company kept building bigger and more powerful clusters ofminicomputers to compete with International Business Machines Corp.,its bigger rival.   Two previous attempts to catch up in the PC business failed: theRainbow, which did not run industry-standard software, and theVaxmate, which was too expensive. In its third attempt, Digital isshowing some humility by selling personal computers made for it byTandy Corp. according to Digital specifications.   ``It's stating for the world that, `Yes, we're going to be in thelow end of the market,''' said Sonny Monosson, editor of theMonosson Report on DEC and IBM.   In the smaller but faster-growing workstation business, whereDigital already has the second biggest share of the world marketdespite selling relatively slow machines, the company plans twolines of fast and relatively cheap entries that should expand itsmarket share.   Workstations are speedy desktop computers capable of displayingintricate graphics and are used primarily by scientists, engineersand other technical professionals.   As a sign of the importance Digital attaches to workstations, thecompany will break from tradition by selling one line incapable ofrunning programs written for its own Vax VMS operating system. Thenew line will run only programs written for Ultrix, Digital'sversion of the Unix operating system.   For the new workstation, Digital had to choose between speed andcompatibility, and it chose speed by using a microprocessor suppliedby Mips Computer Systems Inc. that cannot handle VMS instructions.   In the software area, Digital scored a major but little-noticedvictory last week when the Open Software Foundation, a standardsgroup, selected its technology as the standard for the means bywhich programs appear in ``windows'' on a computer screen.   Technology from Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. wasselected as the standard for the look and feel, or surfacetrimmings, of the screen presentation. The decision on standardsshould help simplify life for computer users and programmers.   ``Until now we've had chaos and anarchy in terms of standards atthe desktop,'' McInnis said.   The emphasis on desktop computers is a return to Digital's roots.The company was founded in 1957 to build small computers bettersuited to individual users than the powerful but complicatedmainframe computers dominant at the time.   Analysts differed on how Digital's new workstations would fareagainst the competition of Sun Microsystems Inc., Apollo ComputerInc. and others.   ``They overtook and passed Apollo in '88. With this new line ofproducts I think they're going to overtake Sun,'' said JonathanCohler, editor-in-chief of Digital Review, an independent weeklynewspaper based in Boston.   But Russell Crabs, an analyst for SoundView Financial Group inStamford, Conn., said the high-powered workstation will not take offright away because there is not enough software written forDigital's Ultrix.   ``I think it's a defensive move, primarily against Sun,'' he said.   Digital will trumpet the new products in a press conference inLittleton, Mass., and other presentations that day and the next inSanta Clara, Calif.; London; Paris; Copenhagen, Denmark; Sydney,Australia; and Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
