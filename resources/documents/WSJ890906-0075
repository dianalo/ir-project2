David Lerner Associates Inc., a Syosset, N.Y., municipal-bond dealer, didn't admit or deny charges that some of its advertising was misleading or inappropriate. &quot;The firm's recruitment advertisements cited earnings figures that were not reasonable,&quot; the NASD said. The firm was fined $10,000 and required for one year to file all media ads with the NASD before publication.    In a statement, David Lerner Associates said much of the dispute concerned ads for &quot;new investment products for which little prior regulatory guidance was available. . . . We continue to adhere to a philosophy of accurate and complete advertising.&quot; Delta Financial Investment, Little Rock, Ark., was fined $50,000 and expelled from membership in connection with failure to maintain accurate records, engaging in transactions to help an institutional customer conceal trading losses, and other alleged violations.    Representatives of the firm disciplined included William D. Lainhart, Sherwood, Ark., fined $7,500 and suspended four months; Gandy L. Baugh, Little Rock, fined $5,000 and suspended for three months; Jack S. Lewis Jr., North Little Rock, Ark., suspended one month; Robert E. Thomas, Little Rock, fined $3,500 and suspended two weeks; Herbert E. Young, North Little Rock, fined $15,000 and suspended for three months; and David B. Higginbotham, Little Rock, fined $3,500 and suspended for two weeks.    Neither Delta nor the officials admitted or denied the allegations. They couldn't be reached for comment. First Interregional Equity Corp., Springfield, N.J., and two principals, Herbert N. Goettlich, Maplewood, N.J., and Anthony L. Gianninoto, Malverne, N.Y., were fined $20,000 each; the men were suspended for 10 business days for various record-keeping and other violations. They didn't admit or deny the allegations.    Mr. Goettlich, speaking for himself, Mr. Gianninoto and the firm, said, &quot;We had some problems between ourselves and our clearing agent,&quot; but &quot;all of these were corrected prior to their being discovered&quot; by the NASD. He noted that the NASD statement said no customer suffered a monetary loss as a result of the conduct in question. &quot;What happened was purely an oversight on our part,&quot; he said.    Government Securities Dealers Inc., New York, and three principals were fined $20,000 each in connection with alleged record-keeping violations as well as alleged failure to disclose completely its formal disciplinary history and permitting four individuals to be associated with the firm without being registered with the NASD. Joseph Tully Blumstein, New York, and Steven Robert Sheldon, Englewood, N.J., each was suspended for 60 days; the other principal fined was Carl Anthony Torelli. The firm and the three men didn't admit or deny the allegations. Hampton Securities Inc., West Palm Beach, Fla., and principal Delores Easthom were fined $15,000 each. The firm was required to disgorge $209,000 and suspended from solicitation of retail business for five days, while she was suspended for 30 days. The action involved findings of securities sales with excessive markups. Wakefield Financial Corp., New York, and principal Alexander Geils Minella, White Plains, N.Y., each were fined $15,000 for allegedly buying securities from public customers at excessive markdowns; they didn't admit or deny the allegations.    Jeffrey Phillip Bohl, Los Angeles, was fined $100,000 and barred, based on findings that he failed to observe industry practice in transferring customer securities accounts from one broker-dealer to another. He allegedly had 11 customers liquidate their accounts and had the proceeds transferred to new accounts at another broker-dealer where he executed purchases to reinstate the previous positions. The NASD said he also engaged in unauthorized trades and retained funds in some accounts.    Messrs. Sheldon, Torelli and Bohl couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Minella declined to comment.    Mr. Blumstein said, &quot;The charges by NASD are largely the result of not filing papers on time.&quot;    Ms. Easthom, principal of Hampton, said, &quot;We didn't agree with it in the first place. We fought it to the point where we ran out of money.&quot;    Individuals barred and fined included Ernest A. Bartlett III, Little Rock, Ark., $15,000; Gwendolyn Blunt, Roosevelt, N.Y., $50,000; Jesse Ramirez Cano, San Antonio, Texas, $17,000; Ronald G.

Williams, Grand Prairie, Texas, $10,000 (on appeal to Securities and Exchange Commission); and Bruce Wilson, Bourbonnais, Ill., $20,000.    Messrs. Bartlett, Cano, Caponi, Daugherty, Dowdey, Helie, Hladky, Hoffman, Lengfelder, Maxfield, Monroe, Moreland, Mulvaney, Parbury, Parker, Prosen, Ranches, Weinstein, Wilbur, Williams and Wilson were unreachable for comment.

James P. Visconto, Philadelphia, was fined $15,000 and barred.    Lawrence J. Dumestre said: &quot;Some five or six years ago, a member of the family started a business and sought advice from me and my son. The mistake I made was using stationery that I paid for but&quot; had the name of his firm on it. &quot;Five or six years later, this was ruled a violation&quot; of NASD regulations, he said, adding, &quot;We don't think we did anything wrong.&quot;    Mr. Otten said, &quot;Unfortunately, all the extenuating circumstances which surrounded the issue aren't for publication.&quot;    Messrs. Borgmann, Gilberg, Hlavka, Lawson, Rosen, Uzwiak, Vermonty, Mueger, Messineo and Visconto declined to comment.    A number of people were fined and suspended: Stephen W.
