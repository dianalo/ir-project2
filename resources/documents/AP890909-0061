The king, Zahir Shah, has been living in Rome since he wasdeposed in 1973. A Soviet-backed coup took place in 1978, and a yearlater Soviet forces invaded to install another puppet government.   The Afghan government has faced a U.S.-supported insurgency thatwas widely expected to topple the Soviet-supported government afterthe withdrawal of Soviet troops in February.   However, the government has held on, helped by both continuingheavy arms shipments from the Soviet union and heavy air support aswell as disunity among the rebel factions.   The United States has been exploring a political settlement forseveral months.   The king has both supporters and opponents among the resistancegroups.   The U.S. envoy visited the king in Rome last week, said theofficial who disclosed the visits Friday night, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   It was at least the second such consultation, he said. ``It wasnot an extraordinary event.'' He declined to identify the envoy.   In Rome, Gen. Abdul Wali, the king's brother-in-law andspokesman, today declined to comment on the reported meeting.   ``As a rule, we do not comment about these matters,'' he said.``I really have no comment to make on this.''</TEXT></DOC>
