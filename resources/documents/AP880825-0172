The depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph, struck land in theDominican Republic after passing 150 miles south of Puerto Rico,according to the National Weather Service in San Juan.   A 6 p.m. EDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center inMiami said the depression was centered over the Dominican Republicabout 75 miles north of Port-au-Prince, capital of neighboringHaiti. It said the weather system was headed west-northwest at 15mph and expected to move along the northern coast of Cuba for thenext 12 to 24 hours.   The system was not expected to grow much stronger unless itscenter moved well north of Cuba, forecasters said.   The depression dropped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in 24hours before moving westward to nearby Dominican Republic,forecasters said Thursday.   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in twoseparate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars asthey were driving along rural roads, police said.   State Secretary Sila Calderon declared a state of emergency, andNational Guard units mobilized to rescue families trapped byswollen rivers. In Mayaguez, on the western side of Puerto Rico,Civil Defense authorities ordered hundreds of residents inlow-lying areas to abandon their homes.   More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged byflooding, including two that were destroyed, according to CivilDefense officials. They also reported 67 flooded areas, 33mudslides, 18 overflowed rivers, eight damaged highways and threedamaged bridges.   Nora Perez Ruiz, 22, fled to an emergency shelter with her twobrothers and mother from her home near Mayaguez.   She said she had worried about flooding since the last majorfloods hit the area in 1975. ``I've been nervous and occasionallyhaven't been able to sleep thinking about when a flood wouldcome,'' she said Thursday.   The state of emergency was lifted Thursday, and public schoolsreopened after a daylong closure. But 485 people in 10 towns werestill being sheltered in schools, housing projects and a sportscenter, Civil Defense authorities said.   The depression was expected to trigger rainfalls of 5-10 inchesin the Dominican Republican, where flash flood warnings were ineffect.   Mark Zimmer, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center inMiami, said the depression would weaken as it passed overHispaniola, the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.   However, he said it could intensify into a tropical storm whenit moves back out to sea. He said that would probably happen Friday.   ``Right now, it's too early to say whether it's going to becomea hurricane,'' Zimmer added.   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximumsustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when maxiumsustained winds hit 74 mph.   Two tropical storms have developed so far in the Atlantic Oceanduring this year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricanestrength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.   Meanwhile, a second depression that formed near the Cape VerdeIslands off West Africa died Thursday in the distant Atlantic Oceanabout 1,550 miles from Bermuda, forecasters said.</TEXT></DOC>
