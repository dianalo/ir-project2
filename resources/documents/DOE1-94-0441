At thesame time, many utilities and regulatory commissions are reluctant tobegin construction of large new plants, both because of current highreserve margins and because of past unhappy outcomes for ratepayers andinvestors when load growth proved lower than expected. This study examinesthe potential long-run financial constraints and risks the electric utilityindustry faces as a result of the current incentives to delay the startof major new projects as long as possible. The study analyzes industry-widefinancial and operating data from 1985 to 2005 under several scenarios.The findings suggest that if the future is no worse than postulated inour scenarios, total construction expenditures and external funding requirementsshould be manageable at the national level. Also, the study finds thatthe cost of delaying new construction {en dash} although possibly significant{en dash} will depend critically on the relative prices of coal and naturalgas which actually occur. Thus this report concludes that the possibilityof significant future financial constraints does not appear to be a problemat the national level. There is good reason to believe, however, thatthere could be a problem under certain adverse conditions for specificregions and for individual utilities. Given the relatively large amountof external funds likely to be needed by some utilities in those situationsand the risks investors may perceive in supplying these funds, financialconstraints may cause some construction delays. 23 refs., 21 figs., 6tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
