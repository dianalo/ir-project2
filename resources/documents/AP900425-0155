Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegateto Congress, following a lengthy investigation of payroll practicesin his office.   Fauntroy, a Democrat who is running for mayor of the nation'scapital, disclosed the Justice Department's decision in a statementthat was released Tuesday.   The Justice Department also confirmed that it had closed theinvestigation of Fauntroy's employment of Thomas John Savage, sonof Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., at a time records indicated the youngerSavage was living in Chicago.   The Justice Department's decision removes a cloud that had beenhanging over Fauntroy's campaign to succeed Mayor Marion Barry.   The mayoral race was thrown wide open earlier this year whenBarry was arrested on cocaine possession charges. Barrysubsequently was indicted on charges of lying to a federal grandjury by denying previous drug use.   The mayor's arrest in an FBI sting operation came just daysbefore he was to announce his candidacy for a fourth term. Barryhas since said he will not announce his decision about seekingre-election until after his trial, set to begin June 4.   The Fauntroy probe was begun after The Associated Press reportedin December 1988 that the younger Savage earned $21,398 working forFauntroy between September 1987 and June 1988 _ a period Illinoisrecords show he was living in Chicago to meet residencyrequirements for running for public office.   Savage swore on election documents filed in connection with hisunsuccessful campaign for the Illinois legislature that he wasliving in Chicago during the period in question.   Asked whether the decision not to prosecute Fauntroy applied toany inquiry into actions by the younger Savage, Justice Departmentspokesman David Runkel said the ``action applies only to DelegateFauntroy.'' He would not elaborate.   Following the initial stories, Fauntroy denied any wrongdoingand said Savage worked as the Midwest coordinator for legislationthat would grant statehood to the District of Columbia.   Savage said he worked every day that he drew a salary as amember of Fauntroy's staff.   The 15-month investigation examined the younger Savage'sfinancial records to determine if he returned any of the money hehad earned to Fauntroy or to his father, according to lawenforcement sources.   A federal grand jury subpoenaed records and took testimony aspart of the investigation.   Fauntroy was informed Monday of the Justice Department'sdecision to close the investigation, said his campaign pressspokesman, Ivan Brandon.   On Tuesday, Fauntroy issued a statement that he was ``pleasedthat this matter has been closed and that this will no longer haveto divert attention from the real issues _ like drugs, crime andhousing _ that are facing the city.''</TEXT></DOC>
