For the solar system, 190flat solar panels were mounted to the roof at the incline of 31{sup 0}.A 13 m{sup 3} solar heat storage tank was equipped. The mounting of thesolar panels was conducted in conformation to the national guides ondesign and execution. The interior system comprises a solar water heatingand refrigerating machine 40USRt, and two gas water heating and refrigeratingmachine 80USRt. Solar energy is utilized by the interior system for aircooling. The perimeter system is operated by heat pump method, and utilizessolar energy for air warming. Simulation calculation reveals that thecontribution of collected solar energy to the total load is a year averageof 19.3%, which is an expectation. The month average collected solarenergy of from December, 1985 to June, 1986 corresponds to 14% of thegas fee of an month average gas use amount. (1 fig)</TEXT></DOC>
