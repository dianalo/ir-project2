George Marchais, the party leader for 17 years, is battered by areformist wing within his own party as well by other politicaladversaries.   Among the recent allegations are that Marchais maintained closeties, including vacation outings, with ousted Romanian dictatorNicolae Ceausescu.   When Marchais was a rising star in the mid-1950s, the partydominated the left in French politics and took a quarter of thevote. In recent national elections it has been hard-pressed to get10 percent.   Party membership, once officially set at 700,000, is nowbelieved to be less than 200,000.   Reformers who advocated changes introduced by Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev have been purged in keeping with the Frenchparty's Stalinist traditions.   Like other large Communist parties in Europe, the French partymaintained it saw glasnost coming and prepared for it withEurocommunism, a 1970s attempt to reconcile communist orthdoxy withlife in a Western parliamentary democracy.   But the reformist wing maintains the party has not been able toadjust to the reality of modern French society, the shrinking ofthe blue-collar population that long was its power base, and theemergence of a high technology, service-oriented economy.   It would like to fashion left-wing ``rainbow politics,''reaching out to embrace such issues as ecology, women's rights andeducational reform.   Editorial cartoons in rightist and leftist daily newsapers havepoked fun at Marchais recently while reporting on the growingdissent within the party.   In reply, the Communist daily l'Humanite published two pages ofletters Tuesday from the sackloads it said were arriving each daysupporting Marchais and his policies.   It also published four pages of pictures of Ceausescu posingwith other French leaders from the left and right, showing thatMarchais was not alone in cozing up to the Romanian dictator.   In a TV interview, Marchais said he met Ceausescu three or fourtimes, the last time in 1984 at a meeting of Communist Partyleaders. He said he took a few days off in Romania after thosetalks and had not returned since.   Replying to those who want him to give up the leadership,Marchais said he had ``no intention of resigning but wanted to workunremittingly to develop party policies in line with myresponsibilities.''   Several prominent members of the reformist wing, known as therenovators, have called for a special party congress to halt theparty's decline, rather than waiting for the scheduled congress atthe end of the year.   Some reformers say at the last congress in 1987, resolutionsexpressing concern about the situation in Eastern Europe wereprevented by party hard-liners from reaching the floor.   Party rules specify that a special congress can be held if morethan half the members are in favor. ``Let them try and we willsee,'' Marchais said.   One of the leaders of the reformist wing, Felix Daumette, aformer member of the central committee, said the party cannotafford to wait until the end of the year if it wants to halt itsdecline.   He said the Communist parties in eastern Euorope that collapsedcame from the same mold as the French party ``and therefore arecaught up in the same failure.''   The French party must redefine itself and might even have toconsider, as the Italian Communist Party is doing, whether its nameshould be changed, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
