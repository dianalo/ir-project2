Curran ruled infavor of General Electric Co. in two cases while holding stock inthe company, despite a requirement that judges disqualifythemselves in such situations, The Associated Press has learned.   Curran said he would ``notify counsel of the existence of theconflicting interest'' and avoid future involvement in casesinvolving GE.

I consider itignorance. As we become more enlightened, then we expect (thesystem) to be more fair,'' said Howard University's Dr. Clive O.Callender, one of the nation's few black transplant surgeons.   The 1{-year-old rules adopted by the United Network for OrganSharing, which administers the national transplant network,emphasize tissue-matching between kidney donors and recipients.   Callender and some others contend the rules put blacks at adisadvantage because a fifth of them have tissue-matching problemsthat make them wait longer for kidneys, most of which are donatedby whites.</TEXT><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ten U.S. Air Force personnel were hurtand 22 military vehicles damaged when villagers armed with clubsand rocks attacked a bombing range to demand the facility beclosed, officials said today.

The spending bill took two months for the House to finish and isunder a White House veto threat because of its drug spendingproposals. Work on the measure is likely to provoke disputes overthe federal deficit, fuel House-Senate rivalries and focusattention on 1990 politics.   But despite those attention-grabbing elements, most eyes willdoubtless be riveted instead on the travails of House Speaker JimWright. Lawmakers struggling over the bill will find themselves inthe position of vaudevillians following the animal act.   Wright, D-Texas, is expected by many to step down this week, his35-year congressional career sunk by ethics allegations over hispersonal finances. Jockeying among Democrats hoping to move up onthe party's leadership ladder is already consuming time in theHouse.</TEXT><DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police today guarded grocerystores in the country's four largest cities after looting by peopledriven desperate by economic crisis prompted President RaulAlfonsin to declare a state of siege.
