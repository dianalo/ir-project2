 Software, because it runs in thebackground on a computer so as to produce documents of variouskinds in the foreground, is classified legally as unpublishedliterary work.andP;  Thus its protection may be affected by thedecision made in the J.D.andP;

 Salinger probably had no idea he wassupporting Apple and other computer companies when he took his grievancesagainst an unauthorized biography to court three years ago, but recent eventshave shown that copyright law makes for strange bedfellows.andM;Salinger, author of the classic coming-of-age novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot;sued an unauthorized biographer in 1987 for quoting too freely from hisletters; journals; and other personal, unpublished works.andP;  He won arestraining order against publication of the biography, although it was laterreversed on a technicality.andM;Computer software legally also is an unpublished literary work, so it carriesthe same copyright protection as Salinger's personal notes and letters.andO;(Software is considered &quot;unpublished&quot; because it works in the background,creating text or images on the computer screen.)andM;Salinger's victory was a red flag to publishers and authors, who mounted acampaign to convince Congress of the need for legislation permitting authorsquote liberally from primary source materials.andP;  Organizations such as theAuthor's Guild testified before Congress that the Salinger decision creates achilling effect on investigative journalism and scholarly writing, much ofwhich is based on long quotations from unpublished primary source material.andM;The computer connection.andP;  Carrying the banner in defense of existing law andin opposition to the publishers and authors was none other than Apple, alongwith other members of the computer industry.andM;&quot;We are content with current copyright law as it relates to computerprograms,&quot; said Ingrid Voorheen, director of domestic policy forWashington-based Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturer's Association,which represents a broad spectrum of computer companies in matters of publicpolicy.andM;Computer manufacturers worry that if Congress passes legislation overridingthe Salinger decision, software copyrights will be infringed by competitors.andM;&quot;The only reason that legislation didn't pass was the opposition of computerinterests,&quot; said Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer whorepresented the defense in the Salinger case and who is presentlyrepresenting the Author's Guild.andP;  &quot;The expressed concern was that Japanesecompetitors would use American software ...andP;  and then claim it was protectedas fair use.&quot;andM;A compromise crumbles.andP;  Publishers and computer-industry representatives satdown this past summer to carve out a compromise resolution that would giveboth sides what they wanted.andP;  Computer makers would get assurances that theirsoftware copyrights would not be watered down, while scholars and journalistswould get exceptions to copyright law allowing them to quote primary sourcematerial.andM;After months of wrangling, the conferees came up with language that wasamenable to both sides.andM;&quot;[The resolution] was an attempt to leave the law as it is for the computerindustry while allowing authors of books and journalists freedom to report onhistory and current events,&quot; Abrams said.andP;  &quot;The computer people never wantedany change.andP;  We wanted the change.&quot;andM;The language was submitted to a special congressional committee that includedSen.andP;  Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.andP;  The proposed legislation died when Hatch said hewanted more time to study the language and that the compromise resolution maybe unnecessary.andP;  Some observers noted that lobbying efforts from Orem,Utah-based WordPerfect Corp. may have spurred Hatch's actions.andM;Not over yet.andP;  Each side seems to understand the other's point of view.andP;  &quot;Wehave sympathies with the authors,&quot; said James Burger, legal counsel forApple's Federal Systems Group in Reston, Va.andP;  &quot;I understand they don't want achilling effect.&quot;andM;Abrams agreed.andP;  &quot;Our hope was [that] since what concerned our side hadnothing to do with the sort of concerns the computer people expressed, thereought to be language available to meet their concerns.&quot;andM;Both Burger and Voorheen conceded that there should be some exceptions forhistorical and scholarly works.andM;The issue will certainly be resurrected.andP;  Asked if he will pursue the issuebefore Congress next year, Abrams replied, &quot;Absolutely ...andP;  this is a veryimportant issue to writers.&quot;andM;Washington -- In the final hours of the 101st Congress, its members approvedlegislation prohibiting &quot;the rental, leasing or lending of commercialsoftware without the express permission of the copyright holder.&quot;andM;The Software Publishers Association, based here, claimed credit for passageof the bill, known as The Software Rental Amendments Act of 1989.andP;  It saidsoftware rentals often lead to piracy and reduced sales.andM;&quot;This industry loses more than $1.5 billion per year to software piracy,&quot;said SPA Executive Director Ken Wasch, in a prepared statement.andP;  &quot;We hope theEuropean Community will follow the U.S.andP;  lead and create a similar provisionin its impending Directive on Software Copyright&quot; (see MacWEEK, Feb.andP;  27).andM;The bill was introduced by Rep.andP;  Mike Synar, D-Okla., and Sen.andP;  Orrin Hatch,R-Utah.andP;  The latter was reportedly influenced by Orem, Utah-based WordPerfectCorp., a major vendor in his state.andM;Most people said their businesses will not be affected by the new law.andP;  &quot;Ourpolicy here is not to rent software at all,&quot; said Richard Katz, president ofBerkeley, Calif.-based Frog's Rentacomputer, a division of Stratus CapitalInc. &quot;We would if we legally could, however.andP;  People want to try softwarebefore they buy.andP;  Vendors should provide copy-protected and timed-expirationversions of their software for rental; they'd sell more, and their buyerswould be more likely to actually use their products.&quot;andM;A related bill, the Copyright Clarification Act of 1990, also passed.andP;  Itallows software developers to sue states and collect damages for copyrightviolations.andP;  -- By Raines Cohen</TEXT></DOC>
