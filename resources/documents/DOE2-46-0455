<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0455 </DOCNO><TEXT>We examine methods for detection of new heavy quarks at the SuperconductingSuper Collider where the heavy quark could be either one of a fourthgeneration of quarks (a,v), or a very massive ({similar_to}50 GeV) topquark. The signals can be classified according to number of leptons inthe final state. Requiring the presence of a single fast isolated leptonalong with {ge} jets and pX/sub T/ allows one to separate the a,v, ort signal from backgrounds. Heavy-quark pairs are produced with sufficienthemispheric separation to allow the direction of one of the quarks tobe tagged by the transverse momentum of the isolated high-p/sub T/ lepton.A distinct enhancement is then observed at the heavy-quark mass in thecluster mass spectrum of all jets moving opposite to the lepton. A fourth-generationquark should also be visible in the two isolated lepton channel, andits mass resolvable. Additional signals from multilepton events wouldthen also be present, though these channels may not yield a heavy-quarkmass determination.</TEXT></DOC>
