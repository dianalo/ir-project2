Donovan's construction company said it plans to revive a dormant civil-rights lawsuit accusing the Bronx district attorney of making improper statements about the former Labor Secretary's fraud case.    A state-court jury on Monday acquitted Mr. Donovan and other defendants of fraud and larceny charges. The 1984 indictment resulted in a long, bitter and expensive legal battle.    The company that Mr. Donovan co-owns, Schiavone Construction Co., said it will likely pay as much as $15 million in legal fees and other costs incurred in the trial by itself, Mr. Donovan and the other defendants.    The federal civil-rights lawsuit, besides asking for undetermined punitive damages, demands that Bronx District Attorney Mario Merola pay the $500,000 fee that Schiavone owes to a public relations firm owned by JWT Group Inc. Schiavone maintains it was forced to hire the firm to counter Mr. Merola's public statements about the case in newspapers, on CBS's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program and elsewhere.    Mr. Merola vigorously denies making improper statements. To win the case, which was filed shortly after the indictment and is pending in Manhattan federal court, Schiavone would have to prove Mr. Merola departed from his proper prosecutorial role in his statements about the case.    It has been almost three years since Mr. Donovan became the first sitting cabinet member to be indicted, leading to his resignation from the Reagan administration. At the time he was charged, Mr. Donovan told reporters the indictment was so &quot;baseless&quot; that it wasn't &quot;worth the paper it's written on.&quot; He claimed the charges were timed to hurt President Reagan's reelection campaign, a claim that state prosecutors here vigorously deny. A state judge refused to dismiss the case in March 1985.    Schiavone is paying $13 million to $15 million in legal fees on behalf of itself, co-owner Mr. Donovan and six other co-defendants who were acquitted Monday, according to a Schiavone attorney.    The eight-month trial, which Schiavone sought to paint as more of an accounting case than a fraud case, cost defense lawyers $5,000 a week in transcripts, according to the attorney. In addition, it was necessary to hire 30 college students to catalog 857 hours of tapes secretly recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the attorney said.    Mr. Donovan and the co-defendants had been charged with helping Secaucus, N.J.-based Schiavone defraud the New York City Transit Authority of $7.4 million from 1979 to 1984 in connection with a subway-tunnel project heavily funded by the federal government -- in part by setting up an allegedly bogus minority-owned concern to qualify for certain contracts. Last month, the presiding judge, New York Supreme Court Justice John P. Collins, reduced the number of felony counts against Mr. Donovan, Schiavone and the other co-defendants from the original 137 to only 10 in order to &quot;simplify&quot; the jury's deliberations.    Jurors said after the verdict Monday afternoon that the case was simple to them: There was too little evidence of wrongdoing, and some appeared to agree with defense attorneys that the charges were politically motivated. District Attorney Merola rejects that claim.    Before the transit-authority case, Mr. Donovan had been dogged by allegations of underworld connections, although an investigation by special prosecutor Leon A. Silverman in 1982 found &quot;insufficient credible evidence&quot; to prosecute Mr. Donovan on charges of criminal corruption and links to organized crime. </TEXT></DOC>
