The explicit probabilistic methods, which explicitlyuse the relationship between the power spectral density function (PSDF)and response spectra (RS), i.e., the PSDF-RS relationship, are foundto have advantages for practical applications over the implicit methods.To evaluate the accuracy of the explicit methods, the root-mean-square(rms) response and the peak factor contained in the PSDF-RS relationshipare systematically evaluated, especially for the narrow-band floor spectralresponse, by comparing the analytical results with simulation results.Based on the evaluation results, a method is recommended for practicaluse for the direct generation of probabilistic FRS.</TEXT></DOC>
