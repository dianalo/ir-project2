In1927 this endemic grass was reported by JoseandCx.174;1 I. Otero from thenearby Guanajibo area and later from Hormigueros; however, these collectionsites have not since been relocated. Both populations appear to have beeneliminated as a result of urban and commercial development (Departmentof Natural Resources 1989, McKenzie et al. 1989).Today <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>is known from only two locations on serpentineslopes and red clay soils of southwestern Puerto Rico: Cerro Las Mesasand the Sierra Bermeja. Recent expansion of residential areas has eliminatedportions of the Cerro Las Mesas population and very few plants remain atthis site. In both areas <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>is threatened by residential and agriculturalexpansion; however, in the Sierra Bermeja a proposal for the mining ofcopper and gold threatens the species as well. In the Sierra Bermeja, asmall range of coastal hills in the extreme southwestern corner of theisland, the species is scattered along the upper slopes where it is foundgrowing on exposed rock crevices (Liogier and Martorell 1982; McKenzieet al. 1989).The tufted culms of <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>may reach 30 to 50 centimeters (12 to 20inches) in height. These culms occur in large bunches and are slender,erect or spreading at the base. The blades are involute, somewhat curvedor flexuous and from 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) long and scarcely1 millimeter (less than \1/16\ inch) wide when rolled. The panicles, from3 to 8 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) in length, are narrow, loose, and few-flowered.The few, distant branches are stiffly ascending and mostly floriferousfrom the base. The glumes are awn-pointed, the first about 7 millimeters(\1/4\ inch) long, the second approximately 10 millimeters (\3/8\ inch)in length. The lemma is from 10 to 12 millimeters (\3/8\ to \1/2\ inch)long, including the 1 millimeter (less than \1/16\ inch) long callus andthe 2 to 3 millimeters (\1/16\ to \1/8\ inch) long, slightly twisted, scabrousneck. The awns are almost equal, divergent or horizontally spreading, 2to 3 centimeters (\3/4\ to 1\1/4\ inches) long and slightly contorted atthe base (Hitchcock 1936).<T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>was recommended for Federal listing bySmithsonian Institution (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978). The species was includedamong the plants being considered as endangered or threatened species bythe Service, as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480) dated December 15, 1980; the November28, 1983, update (48 FR 53680) of the 1980 notice; and the September 27,1985, revised notice (50 FR 39526). The species was designated Category1 (species for which the Service has substantial information supportingthe appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened)in each of the three notices.In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), the Servicereported the earlier acceptance of the new taxa in the Smithsonian's 1978book as under petition within the context of section 4(b)(3)(A) of theAct, as amended in 1982. The Service subsequently made petition findingsin each October from 1983 through 1988 that listing <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>was warranted but precluded by other pendinglisting actions of a higher priority, and that additional data on vulnerabilityand threats were still being gathered. This proposed rule constitutes thefinal 1-year finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of theAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>Pilger (pelos del diablo) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Destruction and modification of habitat havebeen, and continue to be, significant factors reducing the number of <T3>Aristida portoricensis. </T3>Once more widely distributed throughoutthe southwestern part of Puerto Rico, it is now known to occur on onlytwo sites. The expansion of residential development threatens to eliminatethe few remaining individuals on Cerro Las Mesas. The Sierra Bermeja areais one of several areas currently included in the copper and gold miningproposal under consideration by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The areais also subject to intense pressure for residential development. Land clearingto enhance cattle grazing operations has already destroyed some habitatformerly occupied by <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>in the Sierra Bermeja (McKenzie et al.1989).B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Taking for these purposes has not been a documented factorin the decline of this species.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Disease and predation have not been documentedas factors in the decline of this species.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The Commonwealthof Puerto Rico has adopted a regulation that recognizes and provides someprotection for certain Commonwealth listed species. However, <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>is not yet on the Commonwealth list. Federallisting would provide certain protection and, if the species is ultimatelyplaced on the Commonwealth list, will further enhance its protection andpossibilities for funding needed research.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>One of the most important factors affecting the continued survivalof <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>is its limited distribution. Only two populationsare known to exist and one of these has been almost totally eliminated.Introduced grasses, widely planted for grazing purposes, may have excludedthis endemic grass from parts of its past range (McKenzie et al. 1989).The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>as endangered. The species is restrictedto only two locations in southwestern Puerto Rico, both of which are imminentlythreatened by habitat destruction and modification. Therefore, endangeredrather than threatened status seems an accurate assessment of the species'condition. The reasons for not proposing critical habitat for this speciesare discussed below in the ``Critical Habitat'' section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose ciritical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species. The number of individual of <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>is sufficiently small that vandalism couldseriusly affect the survival of the species. Publication of critical habitatdiscriptions and maps in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>would increase the likelihood of such activities.The Service believes that Federal involvement in the areas where this plantoccurs can be identified without the designation of critical habitat. Allinvolved parties and landowners have been notified of the location andimportance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species'habitat will also be addressed through the recovery process and throughthe Section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not now be prudentto determine critical habitat for <T3>Aristida portoricensis.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, Commonwealth, and private agencies, groups, and individuals.The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperationwith the Commonwealth, and requires that recovery actions be carried outfor all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service followinglisting. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst taking are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. No critical habitatis being proposed for <T3>Aristida portoricensis, </T3>as discussed above. Federal involvementis not expected where the species is known to occur. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport itin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity,sell or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or removeand reduce to possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction.In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) tothe Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands andthe removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plantsin knowing violation of any State (Commonwealth) law or regulation, includingState (Commonwealth) criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions can applyto agents of the Service and Commonwealth conservation agencies. The Actand 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits tocarry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits for<T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>will ever be sought or issued, since thespecies is not known to be in cultivation and is uncommon in the wild.Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regardingthem may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, Virginia 22203-3507 (703/358-2104).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevent data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Aristida portoricensis; </T3>(2) The location of any additional populations of <T3>Aristida portoricensis;</T3> and the reasons why any habitat shouldor should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject areas and their possibleimpacts on <T3>Aristida portoricensis.</T3>Final promulgation of the regulation on <T3>Aristida portoricensis </T3>will take into consideration the commentsand any additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this propoal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the proposal. Suchrequests must be made in writing and addressed to the Field Supervisor,Caribbean Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 491, BoqueroandCx.174;1n,Puerto Rico 00622.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
