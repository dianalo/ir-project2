Lugar Advises Next President to `Tell TheTruth'</HEAD><BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In this election year, candidates for theRepublican and Democratic presidential nominations are beingflooded with advice.   Advice on how best to run and win.   Advice on what to do and say.   Advice on what not to do and say.   Advice on what to d if the previous advice proves effective anda prospective president becomes president in fact.   One advice giver _ Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. _ has put hisadvice in more formal form than usual, enclosing it in the 269pages of a hardcover book.   The book: ``Letters To The Next President,'' published by Simonand Schuster, deals with the foreign policy challenges andopportunities the next chief executive will face and is based inlarge part on Lugar's two years' service as chairman of the SenateForeign Relations Committee in 1985 and 1986.   In the book, as in his chairmanship, Lugar pursues restorationof a bipartisan foreign policy based on a drive to extend democracythroughout the world.   He also thinks it important that in an often duplicitous world,the president of the United States tell the truth.   Because he wrote before George Bush and Michael Dukakis clinchedthe Republican and Democratic presidential nominations, Lugar'sadvice is general and not tailored to any particular candidate.   But he warns all candidates to resist the temptation to``express extreme views on foreign policy that may capturetemporary political allegiances but may also undermine longstandingpolicy objectives and cause general dismay.''   Lugar maintains that whoever wins the 1988 presidentialsweepstakes must have as a primary goal ending the foreign policywar between the White House and Congress.   ``In the past few years, we have suffered through too manypartisan impasses in foreign policy, too much finger pointing, andtoo little assumption of responsibility,'' Lugar said.   ``These letters are in part a signal from one senator thatenough is enough.''   Lugar dismisses the notion that the 435 members of the House ofRepresentatives and the 100 members of the Senate seek collectivestatus as 535 secretaries of state, endlessly interfering with thebuilding of an effective foreign policy.   ``Relatively few members spend the time and the energy requiredto articulate comments on the myriad of daily internationalevents,'' Lugar said.   At the same time, Lugar believes Congress has a constitutionalduty to be involved in the formulation and execution of foreignpolicy. He appealed to the next president to reach out tocongressional leaders often.   ``You have to work with Congress,'' Lugar advises the nextpresident. ``It will be exasperating but essential if you want tosucceed.''   Pointing to the Iran-Contra affair in the Reagan administration,Lugar concludes that excessive secretiveness and refusal to consultclosely with Congress are a prescription for disaster.   The senator says he is prepared to argue that President Reaganhad the right to trade arms to Iran in the hope that would lead tothe release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon and to organizeprivate support for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   ``But I will also argue that any president who undertakes suchpolicies with the determination to keep them secret from thepublic, the Congress and from his own administration willjeopardize severely his credibility and his policies once hissecret efforts leave the cocoon,'' he said.   Lugar has much specific advice.   He would have the next president retain the Strategic DefenseInitiative, develop bipartisan support for it and convince theSoviet Union that an effective defense against nuclear attack is intheir interests as well as in the interest of the United States.   He believes bipartisan consensus can be achieved on an effectivepolicy ``to convince our adversaries that we will take theappropriate steps to prevent Nicaragua from injuring thefundamental security of its neighbors or of the United States.''   He believes an armed resistance will continue to be necessary ifNicaragua's Sandinista regime fails to embrace democratic reforms.   He advises the next president to respect the letter and spiritof the War Powers Act.   But some of his advice is as general as it is emphatic.   It is essential, Lugar says, that the next president ``tell thetruth,'' no matter how often he is told the world is managed bestby deception, guile and cunning.   Lugar maintains that the president of the United States mustlive by another, higher standard.   ``Even when his international colleagues are deep into intrigueand falsehood, they need to know our president is telling the truthand that our foreign policy is based on telling the truth.''   The American people need to have every reason to believe whattheir president is saying, Lugar says.   ``The president must maintain his veracity from the beginning tothe end of his administration _ or make way for someone else whowill do so.''</TEXT></DOC>
