In preparation for the next Iran, perhaps Mr. David Abshire's appointment as special counselor should be made permanent. Secretary of Scandal, we'll call it.    An event of this magnitude must have momumental political implications. The question is, What are they? Among the more prominent Americans trying to figure that out are George Bush, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Pete DuPont, Don Rumsfeld, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Chuck Robb, Joe Biden, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Al Haig and all the other would-be successors to Ronald Reagan.    Until the Iran/contra thing broke, the presidential aspirants were standing in the wings of perhaps the hardest act to follow in 20th-century U.S. politics. Ronald Reagan loomed over Washington, capable of turning almost any event to his own large advantage. Suddenly, within the space of a few weeks, the belief is spreading among the political community that Ronald Reagan is an ordinary mortal.    The rules of the game right now seem to be that no one wants to damage the presidency. Damaging Ronald Reagan, however, is quite another matter. Some of the &quot;helpful&quot; advice Mr. Reagan has been getting -- that he testify before Congress about what he knows, that he pardon Messrs. Poindexter and North -- would if followed assure a further fall from grace.    In a none too subtle intimation of mortality, Sam Nunn remarked that the president &quot;has not gotten on top of the facts, and he may or may not have forgotten some of them.&quot; The question of the day is, What did the president know and when did he know it? As if a certain kind of answer to those questions would cause the electorate to see Ronald Reagan the way Dorothy saw the Wizard of Oz.    Perhaps, though, presidential aspirants should think twice about cashing in on the eagerness with which political commentators are discounting the Reagan presidency down to breakup value. Making Ronald Reagan a lame duck now frees everyone else to make 22 months worth of self-destructive statements. On the evidence so far, they're pretty good at it.    In Iowa the other day, George Bush said: &quot;I would be perfectly glad to accept whatever my share of responsibility is.&quot; But let's keep the fun bipartisan. Earlier this month in Moscow, Gary Hart said that even if Mikhail Gorbachev wanted to let more of the country's human-rights cases go free, &quot;he couldn't get his own bureaucracy to respond.&quot; Days later, General Secretary Gorbachev freed from exile that bureaucracy's most prized prisoner, Andrei Sakharov.    The Beltway may be having more fun than it can resist now in belittling Ronald Reagan, but past some point the public is going to start wondering what any of this has to do with the business of running the country. Chuck Robb, who has shown a talent for keeping his eye on the ball, told his party recently that the Iran affair &quot;does nothing to prepare the Democrats to govern, and it seems to me we've got to earn the right to lead America.&quot;    Mr. Robb rightly wants to talk about governance, which succeeds or fails on a particular set of policies. The Beltway insists that the debate focus on the persona of Ronald Reagan, a kind of capital obsession the past six years. Mr. Reagan's personality hasn't hurt, but we've always believed that his policies were the cause of his popularity.    The core domestic-policy value of the Reagan presidency has been that state intervention in the economy over time damages the nation and the prospects for individual economic advancement. The evidence of recent elections suggests that electorates in the U.S. and elsewhere have come to believe strongly that this is true. It will be interesting to see the presidential candidates try to redefine this principle without retreating from it.    In foreign policy, the touchstone event may indeed be the Iran/contra connection. That event, however, has an unwelcome irony for Democrats. Do they really want a 1988 campaign turning on two questions: Who lost Iran and who lost Nicaragua? Such questions can be dismissed as simplistic, but their simplicity usefully defines one's view of politics in the world and the role of the U.S. in that world. The Democratic left has clear, elaborate views on those issues. The question for other Democrats is whether they really want yet again to ask the electorate to put those views in the White House.    In short, the campaign eventually will have to leave the current Iranian sideshow and enter the arena the rest of the country has been operating in for six years. After Ronald Reagan goes, the issues on which he built his success will remain. </TEXT></DOC>
