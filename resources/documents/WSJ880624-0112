Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) makes it a crime to divulge material gathered in a grand-jury investigation. The wiretap law makes it illegal for prosecutors to leak the conversations. The allegations already made by unnamed sources about named Pentagon officials, congressmen and defense contractors are more than illegal. They also raise doubts about the entire investigation.    This prosecution by leak is par for the political prosecutions of the past few years. House Speaker Jim Wright is entitled to be outraged about the five congressmen fingered via leaks, but tell it to Ed Meese or Drexel Burnham's Michael Milken, whose reputations have been smeared beyond recognition by leaks (and by congressmen eager to convict before any indictment). There is a method in the leaks, of course. If prosecutor Henry Hudson or his minions are following the new tradition of strategic leaking, the idea is to sully individuals badly enough that they rat on others or cop pleas.    Ironically, the leaks about the wiretaps raise a big warning flag about this scandal-in-the-making. Apparently the wiretaps show that almost no one thought he was breaking any laws. The unnamed sources describe the conversations as normal-sounding discussions between people who thought they were just doing their jobs. Unlike wiretaps of Mafia bosses, sources said, there weren't code names or other indications of hush-hush guilty minds. &quot;They didn't see themselves as dopers,&quot; one of these sources said, &quot;they considered themselves businessmen.&quot;    So before anyone gets too excited about any charges, remember the mens rea requirement for a crime that there must be some evil intent to break the law. It's unlikely anyone will be convicted for doing what he thought was legal and proper.    By now, when we hear the murky allegation of &quot;fraud,&quot; we reach for our copy of the U.S. Criminal Code. What exactly is the crime supposed to be? If government employees took money or in any way rigged bids they committed a crime-bribery. But the allegations so far center on some vague allegedly wrongful sharing of information. All markets, even socialistic ones like the Pentagon's market for procurement, live on information. What specifications are required? Will our bolt attach to their fuselage? The middlemen consultants are the glue that holds this system together.    We don't need Mr. Hudson to identify the really outrageous multibillion dollar procurement scandal. News stories are catching up with how Reps. Bill Chappell, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee, and Roy Dyson forced appropriations for a $194 million shipboard electronic warfare system by campaign-contributor Unisys that the Navy does not want.    In the current defense budget bill, Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin forced the Army to buy $239 million worth of Oshkosh-made ammo transport trucks that break down. One Pennsylvania congressman held up the bill for a provision forcing the Navy to buy anchor and mooring chains from a firm in Chester by prohibiting the purchase of better and cheaper chains from Spain. Does any of this constitute waste and abuse?    The defense procurement system Congress created is itself the leviathan of waste, fraud and abuse. This makes all the more curious the idea of prosecuting Pentagon officials, consultants and contractors if what they did was try to make this morass work to defend the nation. </TEXT></DOC>
