Wednesday demanded theoverthrow of President Roh Tae-woo and protested the violentsuppression of a May 18, 1980 uprising.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' was the cry from about 50,000 students,workers and townspeople who marched through Kwangju, a city 168miles south of Seoul.   Thousands of students led the procession, waving red, blue andyellow streamers and placards and accusing police of torturing astudent to death earlier this month.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo who committed murder and torture!''screamed protesters who also demanded ``Yankees Go Home!'' Theyaccused the United States of ``patronizing the Roh regime.''   Also Wednesday, the official Yonhap news agency reportedthousands of students staged peaceful campus protests in sevenother cities over the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu.   Thousands of people have protested daily in Kwangju since Lee'sbody was found May 10 in a reservoir near the city. Police hadsought the student for anti-government acts.   Government officials say Lee appears to have fallen into thereservoir after fleeing from police who stopped him at a checkpoint.   Speakers at a Wednesday rally in Kwangju called for a continuedcampaign to end military rule in South Korea.   ``Let's punish Roh and expel the Yankees forever by inheritingthe will of the patriot, Lee Chol-kyu,'' one dissident leader said.The crowd responded with slogans demanding an independentinvestigation into Lee's death.   Police stayed away from the rally in an apparent move to avoidclashes, but a spokesman said 7,000 riot policemen were on standby.   The police are on a nationwide alert to block possible protestsmarking the ninth anniversary of the nine-day civil uprising inKwangju in which at least 192 people were killed.   Dissidents say Roh, a former general, is a front for militaryrule and accuse him of helping his disgraced predecessor, ChunDoo-hwan, to suppress the pro-democracy revolt.   Government officials say they deployed troops as a last resortto end an armed rebellion.   The dissidents claim Chun and other army officers provoked theuprising to seize power. They also say the United States condonedChun's actions _ a charge Washington denies.   Chun went into rural exile last November after making a publicapology for misdeeds under his seven-year authoritarian rule.Opposition parties want Chun to testify before the NationalAssembly.   South Korea has experienced a wave of violent anti-governmentand anti-American protests and labor strikes in recent months.   Roh ordered a crackdown on dissidents after six riot policemendied in a May 3 campus clash.   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for Roh'soverthrow, but they lack support because of their violent tacticsand extremist views.   They also do not have the support of most South Koreans in theirdemands for the withdrawal of about 43,000 U.S. troops stationed intheir country under a mutual defense pact.</TEXT></DOC>
