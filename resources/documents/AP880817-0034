Danforth Quayle''</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The campaign of Democrat Michael Dukakis seizedupon the selection of Sen. Dan Quayle as the Republican vicepresidential candidate to characterize the GOP ticket as elitist,with aides referring to Quayle by his full name _ J. DanforthQuayle.   Dukakis aides already were fond of referring to George Bush byhis full name _ George Herbert Walker Bush _ and they quicklyadopted the same tack in talking about Quayle, heir to an Indianapublishing fortune.   ``I think they'd make better tennis partners than a presidentialticket,'' said Mark Gearan, a spokesman for the Democratic nominee.``Or should that be squash partners?''   Dukakis himself did not attack Quayle directly but was quick topoint out the experience of his own running mate, Sen. LloydBentsen of Texas, and to imply that the 41-year-old Quayle wouldnot be ready to be president should a tragedy befall Bush.   ``Sen. Bensten is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature _somebody who's a real leader in the United States Senate,'' Dukakissaid. ``Sen. Bentsen has been seasoned, experienced on issues offoreign policy, defense, space. That's the kind of stature, that'sthe kind of strength, the kind of maturity I think you want in avice president _ especially when that vice president may bepresident.''   Bentsen, at a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, called the selectionof Quayle ``good news.''   ``I must say, I'm really looking forward to that one,'' he toldabout 400 people gathered in a downtown square at a rally sponsoredby House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.   ``I'm looking forward to comparing our lists of accomplishmentsin the U.S. Senate, and what each of us could do for his runningmate if we were elected,'' he said.   A vice presidential debate is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 11in Omaha, Neb., and Bentsen said he was ready.   ``I've just had a debate with Dan Quayle and it shows again thelack of sensitivity for the concerns and the problems of theaverage working man and woman in this country'' shown by theRepublicans, Bentsen said. ``That debate was over plant closing,and Dan Quayle and the administration lost that debate and theAmerican working man and woman won it.''   President Reagan eventually allowed the legislation, which givesworkers 60 days' notice of plant closings, to become law withouthis signature. But he fought it for a long time, and Quayle was oneof the president's allies in the Senate.   Dukakis and several top aides expressed mild surprise at theselection of Quayle and predicted he would not help the GOP ticketexcept in his traditionally Republican home state of Indiana. Bushaides countered by saying Quayle would help with younger and womenvoters.   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said Quayle'squalifications pale in comparison to those of Bentsen.   ``Lloyd Bentsen clearly passes the first test of the vicepresidency _ he is eminently qualified to step in as president inthe event of a tragedy,'' Estrich said.   Gearan said he was not very familiar with Quayle's record butthen quickly listed a series of issues which he said highlightedthe different directions of the Democratic and Republican tickets.   He cited Quayle's support of a freeze on Social Securitybenefits and his opposition to advance notice of plant closings,drought assistance and civil rights legislation.   ``He does not understand the economic problems facing theAmerican family,'' Gearan said of Quayle. Bentsen supported all ofthe measures Gearan cited in attacking Quayle.   Dukakis aides for weeks have been terming Bush's selection of arunning mate as his opportunity to step out of Reagan's shadow anddemonstrate his independence. After the Quayle choice wasannounced, they swiftly criticized Bush.   ``This was his chance to show some independence, strength andleadership,'' Gearan said. ``Instead he placated the extreme rightwing of his party.''</TEXT></DOC>
