Even if Bush succeeds in pushing out Iraq, analysts see noscenario in which the threat to the Persian Gulf oil fieldsrecedes. &quot;If we leave, they will be threatened again,&quot; saysHenry Schuler of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies. The U.S. has effectively assumed the role ofprotecting all the Gulf states, including Qatar, Bahrain andthe United Arab Emirates.</LP><TEXT>   One sign of a long stay: Many U.S. troops are taking overabandoned Saudi work camps with permanent structures. ButAmerica's new role raises major problems. One is how much ofthe tab will be picked up by the Saudis and by othercountries that depend on Gulf oil. Another is sustainingsupport at home and morale among the troops for defendingnon-democracies whose customs differ sharply from Westernideals.   &quot;What is clear,&quot; says economic consultant David Smick, &quot;isthat the U.S. now has a 51st state: Saudi Arabia.&quot;                                                                                                          OUT IN THE COLD: Top Bush aides put the freeze on theEnergy Department.   Sununu and Darman seek to rein in the department, whichthey see as too eager to act. The White House vetoed DOEplans to pump oil from the strategic petroleum reserve,despite growing pressure with oil prices over $30 a barrel.&quot;You want to use it when you have a situation where supplysuggests it is necessary,&quot; says an administration official,&quot;and we're not there yet.&quot;   Some department officials hoped for a high-profileannouncement of major energy conservation measures, but theWhite House limited them to minor measures and refused togive the announcement a presidential push.                                                                                                          RECESSION FEARS could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.   With the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showingthe number of voters expecting a downturn more than doublingsince Iraq's invasion, University of Michigan economistThomas Juster says that such sentiment could itself push theeconomy over the brink. In almost all recent recessions, hesays, &quot;the trigger has been a drop in consumer spending ondiscretionary items.&quot;   Richard Curtin, who compiles the university's closelywatched consumer-confidence survey, says &quot;attitudes were verybleak indeed the first weekend after the invasion.&quot; Optimismhas increased a bit since, he says, but remains &quot;much lower&quot;than a month ago. Today's GNP revisions will further show theeconomy's weakness even before the crisis erupted.   But Bush strategists hope to blame Saddam Hussein for arecession that may well have happened anyway.                                                                                                          CALIFORNIA'S DECISION to hold its 1992 primary right afterNew Hampshire's juggles the political calculus. The earlyprimary in a large, media-oriented state will give an evenbigger advantage to well-financed and well-known candidateslike Cuomo and Jackson; Democratic insiders expect financialobstacles will keep some lesser-known candidates out of therace.                                                                                                          PAKISTAN'S U.S. AID is in peril if its interim governmentrefuses to let deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto takepart in October elections. Not just liberals but alsoconservative Democrats like Sen. Johnston and Republicanssuch as Sen. Kassebaum warn that a cutoff of the massive U.S.assistance is possible.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS DISTRIBUTE a briefing book to candidates urgingthem to charge Republicans who raise the Sandamp;L issue withseeking to distract from GOP failures ranging from thedeficit to the Hubble telescope. The book also suggests thegovernment manage Sandamp;L assets rather than sell them off: &quot;Canan empty shopping center make a good day care center?&quot;                                                                                                          VOICE FROM THE PAST: George McGovern, the 1972 Democraticpresidential nominee, suggests public support for Bush'sMiddle East moves will wane. &quot;Is the emir of Kuwait and theroyal family of Saudi Arabia the American way of life?&quot; heasks. &quot;If I were in Bush's shoes, I would try to get this tothe conference table as quickly as possible.&quot;                                                                                                          POLITICAL MONEY nears record levels despite Congress'stalk of reform.   House candidates have already outstripped all previousfund-raising -- more than $163 million as of June 30. Senatecandidates are slightly behind the pace of their recordspending of 1986, but have raised more than $115 million,with Republicans enjoying a slight edge over Democrats.   Candidates resort to ever-more-innovative schemes. FormerMaine Rep. David Emery, trying to win back his old seat,offers a two-day Kennebunkport package to PAC managers inWashington. For $5,000, they get a reception with Bush at alocal seafood restaurant, a photo with him, accommodations ata local inn and greens fees.   Sen. Packwood sends a fund-raising letter to pro-Israeldonors, complete with typos to make it look personal.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: In a TV commercial on his former Ku Klux Klanmembership, Louisiana Senate candidate David Duke says,&quot;There are different Klans, just like there's differentfraternities at a college.&quot; . . .
