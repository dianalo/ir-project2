He said he would not concede any territory to the guerrillas,who have been fighting his Soviet-backed government for a decade.   In a 20-minute speech interrupted seven times by applause frommembers of the Parliament, Najib continued his efforts to protrayhimself as no longer the leader of a one-party state.   The Parliament was elected April 14 as part of a governmenteffort to widen its base. It consists of the House ofRepresentatives and a 158-member Senate and replaces theRevolutionary Council as Afghanistan's law-making body.   The guerrilla groups called the elections a farce.   Najib's People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan holds only 46seats _ or 25 percent _ of the 184 occupied seats in the House ofRepresentatives. But virtually all the rest are held by groups orindividuals with ties to the government, according to foreignobservers.   Two former guerrillas hold what the government calls``opposition'' seats.   There are 50 vacant seats that Najib says have been left openfor the guerrillas if they stop fighting. The vacancies are forelectoral districts which are either controlled by the guerrillasor are the scenes of heavy fighting.   ``We are ready to listen to the views of the opposition,'' Najibsaid, speaking in the Pushtu language. ``We are ready to receivethem in Kabul.''   A translation was provided in English for foreign diplomats andjournalists.   The Parliament was convened in the ornately columned,gilt-ceilinged star palace in the foreign ministry compound. Thelegislators, some in turbans and robes, others in Western attire,were brought to the compound in buses guarded by soldiers.   Inside the palace, no shooting was heard during the openingsession, but each day, artillery booms around Kabul, which sprawlson a plain around the bases of several hills.   Najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for thewithdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ``opened new doors forpeace in Afghanistan,'' but he said it ``does not mean overnightpeace.''   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have not halted their battle despitethe start of the Soviet withdrawal May 15, and they say they'llkeep fighting as long as Najib, a former secret police commander,remains in power.   Rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent sinceSoviet troops started withdrawing. The Kabul Times reported thatfive people were killed in rocket attacks Friday.   The Parliament opened with a black-bearded clergyman intoningverses from the Koran, and Najib prefaced his speech with ``in thename of Allah, the merciful and almighty.''   The Afghan president spoke of his desire for a ``neutral andnon-aligned nation,'' but he also spoke of continued friendshipwith the Soviet Union. He said his government wanted a ``mixedeconomy and foreign investment so that all Afghans in their shopscan carry out their work and be sure of their future.''   The last Parliament met in 1973, the year King Zahir Shah wasousted in a coup by his cousin, Mohammad Daoud. Daoud wasassassinated five years later in a coup that installed aSoviet-style government.</TEXT></DOC>
