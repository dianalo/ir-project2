Michael and Suzan Carson described themselves in a 1983jailhouse interview as ``religious warriors involved in a holy waragainst witches.''   Police said they confessed at that time to the three killings,in San Francisco, Humboldt and Sonoma counties, between 1981 and1983. In each case they were convicted and sentenced to at least 25years to life in prison.   The 1st District Court of Appeal, which had upheld the Carsons'two other convictions, on Tuesday affirmed 3-0 the third convictionin the May 1982 shooting death of Clark Stephens near the HumboldtCounty community of Garberville.   Police quoted the Carsons as describing Stephens as a ``pettywitch'' and a ``demon'' who ``wanted to live off (Suzan's) life.''   Officers said Michael Carson also accused Stephens of a sexualattack against Suzan; they quoted Michael as saying he had to killStephens under an Islamic command, as he viewed it, to defend hiswife.   Michael shot Stephens, and Suzan, who was present at thekilling, helped drag the body to a gravesite and burn it, the courtsaid.   The appeals court rejected the Carsons' claims that theirconfession had been coerced, saying the same arguments had beenresolved in the previous two cases and could not be reopened.   The court also rejected Suzan Carson's argument that a portionof her husband's confession had been used improperly against her.   In that portion, Michael said their attacks ``have really beenordered by Suzan ...'' Suzan then interrupted and said, ``ByAllah.'' Michael continued, ``Right, I mean ... but, by Suzan'svoice to me.''   Justice Donald King said the evidence did not violate legalrules that limit use of out-of-court confessions by one personimplicating another.   ``Suzan, by adding the explanation that Allah had given ordersthrough her, thereby adopted Michael's confession and made it herown,'' King said.   The Carsons were also convicted of the 1981 murder of KerynBarnes, who lived with them in San Francisco, and the 1983 murderof Jon Hellyar, who had picked them up hitchhiking and taken themto Sonoma County.</TEXT></DOC>
