ManuelAntonio Noriega because of his constant drinking and corruption,which left troops so poor they had to mend their own boots, thewife of the slain coup leader says.   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, who was the first person to makecontact between the conspirators and U.S. officials, described themood among the rebels before the Oct. 3 revolt led by her husband,Maj. Moises Giroldi.   ``My husband was once stationed in Nicaragua, and he always saidto me, `It can't continue this way _ we are on the same road asNicaragua under Somoza. The officers are corrupt and we will end upthe same as Somoza,''' the 36-year-old Mrs. Giroldi said of thelate Anastasio Somoza.   She fled to Miami with her three children, her brother and herparents after the failed coup.   Giroldi was named to the top security post at Noriega's centralheadquarters after he helped put down a coup in March 1988. Butwhile Noriega grew wealthy, Giroldi and other loyal militaryofficers saw their countrymen and their troops' situationdeteriorate, his wife said in an interview last week.   ``The people were hungry. The soldiers were hungry,'' she said.``There were units where they don't even have enough money to takea bus home. If their boots have holes, they must repair themthemselves.''   In addition, she said, Noriega drank to excess and behavederratically.   ``General Noriega spends all day drinking, 24 hours a daydrinking, so he can make decisions,'' she said.   She said he fires ministers and banishes officers based on whathis inner circle tells him while he is drunk.   On Sept. 29, Giroldi told his wife he planned to lead fellowofficers in a coup, arrest Noriega and turn him over to the U.S.military. They never planned to kill him, she said.   Then on Oct. 1, she said, he asked her to get in touch with U.S.officials because it was too risky for him and the other officers.   A friend who worked with the U.S. military arranged a meetingbetween Mrs. Giroldi and a U.S. colonel.   She told the colonel the rebels needed the United States to sendflights over Panamanian air bases to keep Noriega loyalists on theground. They also wanted U.S. roadblocks around Noriega's downtownheadquarters.   The colonel called in two Americans in street clothes who latermet with her husband. Giroldi said he was elated with the U.S.response.   On Oct. 2, her husband reported to headquarters. She visited himin the barracks that night. She would never see him again.   The next morning she took her family to Fort Clayton, a U.S.base outside Panama City. But because the coup plans were secret,the officer on duty wouldn't let her in at first, she said.   ``I didn't know whether to trust him or not. It was a verydifficult situation,'' Mrs. Giroldi said. She was quite literallysaved by the bell.   ``The alarm went off and they were yelling, `Alert,' to everyonein Fort Clayton,'' she recalled. ``He asked why I was there, and Ianswered, `For the alert.' ''   Later, soldiers who survived the coup, including Capt. JavierLicona, the highest-ranking plotter to escape, helped her piecetogether what happened.   At first it went according to plan, she said. Noriega wascaptured, and tried to negotiate with Giroldi, but her husbandrefused, she said   Then, she said, they realized a fellow conspirator, Maj.Federico Oleochea, head of the strongest local unit, Battalion2000, had betrayed them and was surrounding the barracks.   ``If Major Oleochea had not turned on us, all would have beenwell, all would have been as planned,'' she said. ``But he is thetype who always bets on the winner.''   Licona tried to call in American help using an emergency numbergiven Giroldi at the meeting, but the officials doubted Licona'sidentity, she said. Licona had to leave the headquarters and go toFort Clayton to convince them.   ``There was a lot of trouble trying to identify him,'' she said.``Confirming this, confirming that. When they finally said theywere going to act, it was very late. That was the failure.''   Giroldi and his fellow conspirators apparently surrendered. SomePanamanians said Giroldi was shot personally by Noriega. But asoldier who survived told her all of the prisoners, including herhusband, were lined up and mowed down with a machine gun.</TEXT></DOC>
