Not Roger Bassett, owner of Bassett's Original Turkeyfast-food restaurants.   When home-cooked Thanksgiving leftovers make such goodsandwiches at home, ``why would you pay $5 for a sandwich'' at oneof his restaurants? The answer, he said, is they don't.   Sales usually drop 50 percent for three days following theholiday.   But Bassett said he understands.   ``You have a wonderful dinner at home and you make sandwicheswith the leftovers,'' he said.   Bassett's Original Turkey has grown from a small oven set up ata Sundae bar to a nine-restaurant chain in Pennsylvania, NewJersey, Maryland and Virginia.   The latest franchise opened to brisk business last week at amall in downtown Philadelphia.   Bassett, 29, stood back and watched the people line up to buyhis cold sandwiches and his hot opened-faced platters.   ``People like turkey,'' he said. ``People are tired of pizza andcheesesteaks.''   Bassett is a fifth-generation member of the century-oldBassett's Ice Cream Co.   He originally carried on the family's tradition of selling icecream. When he was 19, he opened a small sundae bar inPhiladelphia's Reading Terminal Market.   His father visited the market on a regular basis, but grew tiredof eating greasy hamburgers and sloppy pizza.   ``So he asked me if I would fix him a turkey sandwich wheneverhe came in,'' Bassett said.   After setting up a small oven at the ice cream stall, Bassettwandered through the market and bought tomatoes, lettuce, bread anda turkey.   ``I cooked a turkey sandwich for him,'' he said. ``Then some guysaw him eating and asked where he got the sandwich. The next day Icooked two turkeys. They sold out strictly on word of mouth.''   He finally gave in and bought the equipment to make turkeysandwiches on a larger scale.   The business was an immediate success, he said. Within fiveyears, he opened up three more stores of his own. In 1989, Bassettsold his ice cream stand as more malls wanted his turkey in theirfood courts. He turned to selling franchises for the next fivestores.   Bassett will concentrate on the Northeast first, but wants tosell franchises nationally in five years. ``I've already got offersin California, Florida, and Canada,'' he said.   He said his menu is perfect in mall food courts because itoffers an alternative for health-conscious consumers.   Pat Glickman agreed as he sat down to eat the turkey sandwich hejust bought.   ``I love turkey,'' said Glickman, 26, of Philadelphia. ``It'shealthier for you than McDonald's or Burger King.''   Another customer, Jennifer Landis, said she had passed Bassett'sTurkey stores several times without stopping before she gave in andordered a platter.   ``One of my favorite lunches is an open-faced turkey sandwich,''said Landis, 32, of suburban Jamison. ``I enjoy it. At home I eatit a lot.''</TEXT></DOC>
