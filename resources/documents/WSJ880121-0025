Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST EUROP JAPAN CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar continued to give back gains related to last Friday's favorable U.S. trade deficit news, falling more than 1% against major currencies, as some traders said they saw &quot;a return of bearishness.&quot; &quot;The euphoria has most definitely worn off from the Friday figures,&quot; Joseph Volpicella, executive vice president of Spavo Financial Corp., said. &quot;There are a lot of people crawling back out of the woodwork talking bearishly about the dollar.&quot;    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood near its intra-day lows. The dollar slipped about 1.1% to 127.12 Japanese yen, eased about 1.3% to 1.6569 West German marks, and dropped nearly 1.7% to 1.3450 Swiss francs. The British pound rose 1.3% to $1.7995.    The dollar opened in Tokyo Thursday at 127.15 yen, down from the close of 128.78 yen.    Traders expressed disappointment that corporations aren't supporting the speculative dollar-buying that pushed the U.S. currency up sharply on Friday. &quot;You can't support a dollar rally on speculation alone,&quot; Robert A. White, vice president for foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California, said. &quot;Ultimately, we speculators all go back to even. It's the corporates that can sustain the dollar rally by being the real movers of money.    U.S. companies must exchange foreign revenues into dollars to bring the money back to the U.S. But Spavo's Mr. Volpicella contends that companies were afraid to trade dollars before last Friday's report on November merchandise trade. After the Commerce Department reported a smaller-than-expected deficit, the dollar jumped and companies decided to wait until the dollar retreated.    Now, traders assert, companies are willing to wait for what they perceive as the dollar's bottom before they move heavily into the market.    As the dollar slides, traders said, speculation is again growing about when the central banks might intervene to support the U.S. currency. J. Thomas Stanley, a vice president for foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said the speed of a dollar drop could make the difference. A precipitous drop would bring the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations scrambling to support the dollar, he argued.    The dollar fell sharply in early European trading on a rumor that yesterday's editions of the Washington Post would report that the November trade-deficit figure released Friday was understated by about $3 billion. Although no such story appeared in the Post, the dollar never recovered from the losses.    &quot;Europeans have gotten themselves whipped up into somewhat of a pessimism about the dollar,&quot; Christopher Bourdain, foreign-exchange adviser for BankAmerica International, said. U.S. traders are slightly more optimistic about the dollar's future levels because &quot;no one is really doing much better than us in terms of growth.&quot;    Traders said signs of weakness in the West German economy are creating speculation of a German discount-rate cut sometime today. The mark was weak against the yen and Swiss franc yesterday as traders sold marks in expectation of a possible rate cut, said Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., New York.    In Frankfurt, an official at the German central bank called for more fiscal stimulation. Dieter Hiss, a member of the Bundesbank council, also said that &quot;the central banks cannot leave the foreign exchange markets to themselves.&quot;    In Japan, central bank officials indicated that they favor a cut in the long-term prime lending rate and said they think the dollar has bottomed. In a Tokyo off-the-record briefing, one Bank of Japan official said, &quot;It's quite natural to let market conditions decide where (the long-term prime rate) is going.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1 an ounce to $476.50 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $477.25 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                  Late New York Trading                Wednesday, Jan. 20, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
