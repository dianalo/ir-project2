Scientistswatching the eclipse were stunned by the sight of a second natural phenomenon:lava and steam issuing unexpectedly from the flanks of a nearby volcano.;   &quot;I'm not a geologist, but that coincidence is very, very exciting,&quot; said AkioMorita, chief executive officer of Sony Corp., who trained as a physicist andwas atop this 13,800-foot dormant volcano watching the eclipse withastronomers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  VOLCANO PUTS ON A SHOW OF ITS OWN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     By late morning, scientists were still unsure if the neighboring Mauna Loavolcano had actually erupted.;    Astronomers here had turned from watchingthe solar show, shortly after 7:30 a.m. local time, to see a line of steamplumes appear on Mauna Loa's gently sloping east side, about 10 miles away.;   One astronomer watching with binoculars reported seeing a fountain of brightorange lava.;    No communities are in any immediate danger. No one lives onthe barren flanks of Mauna Loa, which is the world's largest volcano.;   Hawaii's volcanoes rarely erupt explosively. Instead, they usually ooze riversof lava that flow slowly enough for people to avoid injury. Only one personhas been killed by a Hawaiian volcano this century.;    Big Island mayorLorraine Inouye, who was on Mauna Kea to watch the eclipse, immediatelytelephoned her county's civil defense office to report the eruption. But theHawaiian Volcano Observatory, which monitors Mauna Loa, insisted the line ofvents was simply steaming because rain had fallen on an existing rift zone.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID ANSLEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910711  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  12A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  246  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 11, 199100193231,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
