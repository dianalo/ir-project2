After absorptionof the virus and formaldehyde fixation, rabbit antibodies and Staphylococcusaureus protein A labeled with {sup 125}I formed a specific complex onthe surfaces of the cells. The optimal multiplicity of infection in thissystem was 10 PFU per cell. The virus was internalized at 33 and 37{sup0}C, but internalization did not take place at 25 or 4{sup 0}C. The bindingwas proportional to the number of cells and was significant within 30s. Cell surface receptors were still active after fixation, and onlyintact viruses were bound, as demonstrated by the lack of binding ofthe purified, isolated virion proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.</TEXT></DOC>
