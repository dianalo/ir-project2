Rather similar conditions were found for theretention of /sup 227/Th, but with a somewhat smaller decrease (45 to35%). These skeletal doses are often based on the values of femur concentration.In the case of mice, however, most bone tumours occur in the lumbar vertebrae,where the retention does not vary much with age. In contrast to the skeletonthe retention of /sup 224/Ra was increased with age in the spleen, reachingconcentrations even higher than that in the skeleton of old animals.It was remarkable that radium was retained in the spleen in this highconcentration only when it was injected directly (as /sup 224/Ra) butmuch less, when it was given indirectly i.e. as the daughter nuclide/sup 223/Ra of its parent /sup 227/Th. If equal skeletal doses for differentaged animals are to be intended, the reduced retention in the higherage has to be taken into account. Since dosage is mostly related to bodyweight (for instance Bq per kilogram) the resulting skeletal dose willbe too small if the body weight and skeletal weight would be proportional.Since by the growth of fat tissue the body weight normally increasesmore than skeletal weight (after an age of a few months), the loweredretention might be more or less corrected for by relating to body weight.3 refs.; 3 figs. refs.</TEXT></DOC>
