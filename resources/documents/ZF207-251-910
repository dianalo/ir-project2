 402 on Reader Service CardandM;Silicon Graphics has brought real-time, full-color 3-D graphics withinreasonable reach of every desk top.andP;  The low price tag of the Personal Irisworkstation ($16,000 for the entry-level version) belies its exceptionalgraphics power, which the Personal Iris inherits from its more-powerfulcousins, the Power Series.andM;Coupling Mips Computer Systems' R2000 RISC processor with Silicon Graphics'own Geometry Engine graphics subsystem, the Personal Iris provides an elegantand fertile environment for the development and use of applications thatrequire excellent graphics.andM;Like most workstations, the PErsonal Iris uses a System V Unix-basedoperating system (called Irix).andP;  Its windowing system is Silicon Graphics'proprietary 4Sight, which supports Sun's NeWS (Network-extensible WindowSystem) in addition to Silicon Graphics' own Graphics Library (GL) andDistributed Graphics Library (DGL).andM;Graphics programming is accomplished through GL, a proprietary library thatSilicon Graphics has used for several years.andP;  Phigs support is available fromTemplate Graphics Software of San Diego.andM;From its system cabinet on in, the design of the PErsonal Iris is excellentand elegant (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  The workstation is highly modular; its interior isreached by unlocking a large latch on the plastic shell and removing thepanels.andM;The entire CPU subsystem and I/O subsystem are implemented on a singlecomponent board; a second board contains the graphics subsystem.andP;  Both boardsare located in an &quot;electronics module&quot; that is not intended to be opened byusers.andP;  In the event of hardware problems involving these boards, the entireelectronics module is removed and replaced.andM;The front panel includes a swinging plastic door that conceals twohalf-height bays.andP;  In DR Labs' review unit, one of these bays was occupied bya cartridge tape drive, the power switch and system status LEDs.andM;The Personal Iris' CPU uses the same Mips Computer systems R2000 chip thatDEC uses in its DECstation 3100 and DECsystem 3100, and that Mips ComputerSystems uses in its own M/120 compute server.andP;  (For a review of theDECstation 3100, see &quot;DEC's One-Two Workstation Punch,&quot; Feb. 6, page 55; fora review of Mips' M/120, see &quot;More Mips for the Money,&quot; March 6, page 35.)andM;The Personal Iris uses the 12.5MHz version of the R2000 instead of the16.67MHz version that is used in both the Mips M/120 and the DEC machines.andO;This slower clock speed is reflected in the performance of the Personal Irisin running DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite.andM;Because RISC hardware places a greater burden on compilers to generateoptimal instruction sequences that are tuned to that hardware, SiliconGraphics--like most vendors using the Mips chips--relies primarily oncompilers developed by Mips Computer Systems.andM;The system architecture of the Personal Iris also bears strong similaritiesto both the M/120 and the DECstation 3100 (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The CPU shares aprivate 32-bit, 100MB-per-second bus with a 16KB instruction cache, an 8KBdata cache and an optional R2010 floating-point unit.andP;  The Personal Iris'caches are substantially smaller than those in its Mips and DEC counsins,which are 64KB for both instructions and data.andM;The CPU subsystem interacts with main memory through a write buffer, whichallows the CPU to issue a write-to-memory command and resume processingimmediately.andP;  The write buffer can hold only a single entry.andM;The Personal Iris can have 8MB, 12MB or 16MB of main memory that isdual-ported between the CPU and I/O subsystems.andP;  The I/O subsystem is basedon a 10MHz, 32-bit I/O bus and provides the Personal Iris with Ethernet,SCSI, audio and parallel interfaces, as well as connection to the graphicssubsystem.andM;The Personal Iris incorporates two 10,000-gate gate arrays to control the CPUand I/O subsystems.andP;  The CPU controller manages the CPU and I/O subsystems'access to main memory and handles the direct memory access (DMA) transfersbetween the CPU and graphics subsystems.andM;In addition, the CPU controller handles the keyboard, mouse and other serialI/O interfaces.andP;  The Personal Iris is equipped with two RS-232-C ports, bothhaving full modem control.andM;The I/O controller handles all I/O tasks, freeing the R2000 CPU from thoseresponsibilities.andP;  It manages the 10MHz, 32-bit I/O bus as well as theEthernet, SCSI and audio interfaces and a parallel interface.andP;  It onlysupports thick-wire Ethernet.andM;The Personal Iris has a single VME bus slot that can contain a standardsingle double-height (6U form factor) VME board.andP;  This VME slot can acceptbus master cards, which can access main memory directly.andM;The Personal Iris is available in a diskless version or with internal SCSIdisks offering 155MB or 344MB of formatted disk capacity.andP;  It also has a baythat can hold either a half-height QIC-150 SCSI tape cartridge drive oranother full-height disk drive.andP;  (Half-height disk drives are not yetavailable for the Personal Iris.)andP;  The unit includes a SCSI connector on thereal panel for further disk or tape expansion.andM;GEOMETRY ENGINEandM;The Personal Iris' graphics subsystem could really be considered the heart ofthe system.andP;  The unit's exceptional real-time 3-D graphics performance is dueto the VLSI-implemented four-stage graphics pipeline, which resides on asingle component board.andM;The graphics subsystem has four discrete stages: the host interfacesubsystem, the geometry subsystem, the raster subsystem and the displaysubsystem (Fig.andP;  3).andM;Each of the subsystems is pipelined, allowing each to operate in parallelwith the others.andM;The host interface section receives graphics commands and data from the CPUthrough the 32-bit I/O bus, performs some processing on these commands anddata as appropriate, and passes them on to the other subsystems.andM;It also serves as the controller for the geometry subsystem and manages alldata flow to and from the host CPU.andP;  DMA transfers can be executed to passlarge amounts of pixel data between the geometry subsystem's RAM or the framebuffer and the host CPU.andM;The geometry subsystem consists of the Geometry Engine, 16KB of microcode RAMand 8KB of data RAM.andP;  The Geometry Engine is implemented on a single chip andperforms the bulk of the graphics subsystem's work: It receives graphicscommands and single-precision floating-point data from the host and appliestranformations, lighting calculations, clipping, and the beginning of scanconversion, then passes the results to the raster subsystem.andM;The Geometry Engine understands graphics primitives of points, lines, convexand concave polygons, characters and splines.andP;  It performs rotation,translation and scaling on the data from the host and reduces it to spans,lines, and points.andP;  (A span is a line connecting two vertices of a polygonand is used for scan conversion.)andM;In addition, the Geometry Engine maintains the position, direction andintensity of one to eight local or &quot;at infinity&quot; light sources, as well asthe material coefficients for the ambient, diffuse and specular reflectiveaspects of the objects to be displayed.andM;Material coefficients are used to present different surface types; forexample, a copper surface has different reflective qualities than a ceramicone.andM;These values for light sources and reflective aspects, when combined with theposition of a vertex, allow the engine to calculate a color value for thatvertex.andM;The Geometry Engine clips those vertex coordinates that do not need to bedisplayed.andP;  It also performs the first stages of scan conversion--the processof computing the coordinates of each pixel needed to represent a line.andP;  Forsimple lines this is handled by the raster subsystem, but for polygonsseveral preliminary steps must be taken by the graphics subsystem.andM;A polygon must be broken up into trapezoids, and the edge slopes of eachtrapezoid must be calculated.andP;  Once the polygons have been thus reduced, theraster subsystem completes the process of scan conversion: filling pixelsbetween span endpoints.andM;The Geometry Engine also monitors the graphics subsystem pipeline in order tosave its state when a context switch is indicated by the host CPU.andM;RASTER MASTERandM;The raster subsystem performs the final stage of scanconversion--interpolating between span endpoints--and controls the framebuffer and Z-buffer.andP;  (The latter component is optional.)andM;The raster subsystem is controlled by a single chip that accepts commands andpixel, color and slope data from the geometry subsystem.andP;  If necessary, ititerates spans and lines to calculate pixel locations and values.andP;  Forexample, given two endpoints of a line, it must calculate the slope anddetermine which pixels need to be lit in order to display the line properly.andM;The subsystem also offers a fast screen-clear operation, anti-aliasing anddithering.andM;The Personal iris' frame buffer can have either 12 or 32 bit planes and,optionally, a 24-bit-plane Z-buffer.andP;  In the minimal configuration, eightbits are used for color, two bits for window ID control and two bits foroverlay and underlay planes.andP;  The expanded configuration has 24 color bits,four window ID bits, and four overlay and underlay bits.andM;The color bit planes specify the color of each pixel and can be configured inseveral ways.andP;  The eight-bit configuration always uses color index mode; RGBmode is available on the 24-bit configuration.andM;Because each pixel displayed on the screen is in fact made up of three valuesof red, green and blue, the color bit planes can be used to store thosevalues directly: eight bits for the red value, eight bits for green and eightbits for blue.andP;  This is RGB mode.andM;However, the eight-bit frame buffer can't hold enough information torepresent RGB values adequately, so instead the eight bits represent a singleeight-bit binary number that serves as an index into a table of full RGBvalues.andP;  For example, a value of five in the frame buffer could mean red andblue values of 255 and a green value of zero, which would display the colormagenta on the screen.andM;The color map can have 4,096 entries, and these entries can be changed by agraphics application.andP;  However, changes to the color map affect the entiredisplay, not just the window in which an application is running.andM;The window ID planes are used by Silicon Graphics' 4Sight window system toindicate the state of each window on the display.andP;  This allows multiple 3-Dimages to be displayed in windows.andM;Overlay and underlay planes are used for such items as pop-up menus andwindow backgrounds.andM;The optional 24-bit-plane Z-buffer is used for hidden-surface removal; aspixels are written to the frame buffer they are also compared to acorresponding address in the Z-buffer, and those pixels which will be hiddenby other pixels are discarded.andM;This optional Z-buffer can also be directly written to by the GL graphicslibrary, or alternate depth-comparison functions and write masks can be used.andM;SHOWING THE COLORSandM;Finally, the display subsystem sends the values stored in the frame buffer tothe digital-to-analog converters for display on the monitor.andP;  If necessary,the values are translated via the appropriate mode--RGB or color map.andM;The display subsystem uses five Multimode Graphics Processors (MGPs) to readthe color and window planes of the frame buffer.andP;  As many as 16 differentwindows can be displayed simultaneously in different color modes.andM;In RGB mode the digital-to-analog converters receive three eight-bit valuesper pixel, which correspond to voltages for the red, green and blue electronguns of the color monitor.andP;  In color map mode, the value from the framebuffer is used as an index into the color map to yield the three eight-bitRGB values.andM;Because the human eye is sensitive to intensity ratios rather than absolutevalues, most workstations provide some form of gamma correction, whichcompensates for non-linearities in the color display hardware.andP;  This gammacorrection can be controlled by applications in the Personal Iris.andM;The MGPs also control the graphics cursor, which can be a user-definablerectangular shape or a full-screen crosshair cursor.andM;In addition to the Personal Iris' standard display, it has timing oscillatorsthat are compatible with the RS170A or Euro standards for video signals.andP;  Anoptional genlock board provides signals that comply with the NTSC videosignal standard and allows the display timing of the Personal Iris to besynchronized to external video equipment.andM;UNIX FOR THE IRISandM;The Personal Iris runs a version of Unix System V.3 called Irix that, likemany contemporary versions of Unix, includes features such as TCP/IPnetworking from the Berkeley 4.3BSD version.andM;Irix is divided into two configurations: the application environment and thedevelopment environment.andM;The application environment is intended for Personal Irises employed by endusers who will not do any programming or development configuration does notinclude the C language compiler or the header files and libraries necessaryfor compiling programs.andM;It also includes only minimal documentation: the only manual included withthe application environment is the Personal Iris Owner's Guide, a very basicbut well-designed 161-page manual that includes sections on unpacking andsetting up the Personal Iris, using the window system, using the directoriesand files, simple Unix commands, basic system management, and sometroubleshooting.andM;The development environment includes the C language compiler and all headerfiles and libraries necessary to develop applications on the Personal Iris inany language, including graphics applications.andM;The development environment also includes a wealth of excellentdocumentation.andP;  In addition to the standard Unix man pages (withmodifications for Irix), the documentation set includes the Programmer'sGuide, the System Administrator's Guide, the User's Guide, the 4Sight User'sGuide for programming the window system, the PostScript Language Referenceand Cookbook, the C Programming Kit, the Graphics Library Kit, the TCP/IPUser's Guide, the Communication Guide, and the Mail Reference Manual, all ofwhich are comprehensive and useful.andM;Irix has several extensions that are not derived from System V or 4.3BSD;these include a modified file system (the Extent File Systems, or EFS),non-degrading process priorities and high-resolution timers forquasi-real-time applications, library and kernel primitives for multiprocessapplications and concurrent programming, a version of the dbx debugger thatcan examine multiple processes, and memory-mapped files.andM;The EFS is very similar to the Berkeley fast file system but usesvariable-length extents.andM;The Network File System (NFS) is available as a separate product.andM;Installation of software on Irix is a simple task: The user shuts down thesystem, then restarts it while holding down the Escape key which brings up ashort menu.andP;  From here system diagnostic can be run or system softwareloaded.andP;  During the course of our review of the Personal Iris, we installedthe application environment, the Fortran compiler and a PC emulator calledSoftPC without any problems whatsoever.andM;LOOKING AHEADandM;The 4Sight windowing system for the Personal Iris is based on a client/servermodel like the one used by the X Window System and Sun Microsystem's NeWS.andO;The system has three distinct components: the client, the server and thewindow manager.andM;The graphics client or application program--which can be written using GL,DGL or PostScript--does not directly manipulate the display screen of thePersonal Iris; instead, it uses the services of a server (also known as adisplay server)--which can be implemented in either DGL or NeWS--to performthe display operations.andM;This separation of responsibilities between client and server allows muchmore hardware independence, as well as offering a better programming modelwhen tackling graphics applications.andM;Finally, the Irix Window Manager (also known as Max) is a separate entity,implemented in NeWS, that consists of PostScript routines defining theappearance and function of windows, icons, menus and controls.andM;The independence of Max means that regardless of the system being used byeither client or server, the windowing system can be customized to a user'spreferences.andM;Because GL and the Personal Iris' hardware are both designed to support thewindowing system, graphics displays are contained within windows and can bemanipulated just as any other type of window, unlike other graphicsworkstations that use the entire screen for graphics (Fig.andP;  4).andM;When the Personal Iris starts up, or when no one is logged in to the graphicsconsole, the Personal Iris displays a box with an Irix log-in prompt.andP;  Oncethe user has logged in, Max starts up.andM;By default, Max provides three &quot;tool chests&quot; and a shell window.andP;  These toolchests--small, permanent windows containing just a menu of items to beexecuted or to alter the window environment--are placed in the upper leftcorner of the screen.andP;  The shell window is in the lower left corner.andP;  Theselocation preferences--or indeed, even the presence or absence of these toolchests and the shell window--can be changed by the user by modifying a fewfiles.andM;The Tools tool chest allows a user to create a new shell window forcommand-line access to Irix, show and modify the color map and create clocks.andO;The Windows tool chest allows mofication of window styles and operations thataffect all windows, such as reducing all windows to icons or tidying up iconson the screen.andP;  The Demos tool chest lets the user run GL or NeWS graphicsdemonstrations.andM;Using Max is quite easy; to move a window the user merely holds the middlemouse button while the cursor is on a window frame or anywhere on an icon,drags the window or icon, and then releases the button when the window oricon is at the new location.andP;  A window can be reduced to an icon by clickingthe left button of the mouse while the cursor points to the small box in theupper left corner of the window's frame.andP;  Windows can be reopened by clickingthe same mouse button while the cursor is located anywhere within the icon.andM;A window can be resized via another small box in the upper right corner of awindow frane.andP;  Clicking the mouse's right buttn opens a menu, the contents ofwhich depend on where the cursor is when the button is pushed.andM;When the cursor is on a window's frame or on an icon, clicking the rightbutton offers a menu of window-manipulation operations such as making awindow into an icon or moving it.andP;  When the cursor is within a window,clicking the right button calls up a menu that usually isapplication-dependent.andP;  When the cursor is on the Max's background, clickingthe right mouse button let the user log out of the graphics console.andM;4Sight uses pull-right submenus by default; if a menu item has a submenuattached (indicated by an arrow), pulling the mouse to the right on that itemdisplays and enters the submenu.andM;Mouse button definitions, like all other Max elements, can be changed.andP;  Forexample, the left button could be made the menu button.andM;The windowing system can be modified by writing small PostScript programs.andO;For example, following an example in the 4Sight User's Guide, we added aHosts tool chest to our default environment by writing a small PostScriptprogram (Fig.andP;  5) and modifying the user.ps file in our home directory, whichis read by Max when it starts up.andM;This Hosts tool chest allowed us to access one or more remote hosts easilyvia rlogin by using a pull-down menu (Fig.andP;  6).andP;  We simply selected a hostname from the list provided, and a window was created--with a defaultsize--that we could then place where we wanted on the screen.andP;  All we thenneeded to do to be logged in to the remote host was to supply a password.andM;Any element of the window system--colors, fonts, shape, dimensions andorganization--can be modified using Post-Script programs.andM;SUPERLATIVE GRAPHICSandM;Although the GL, DGL and NeWS systems provide access to windowing operations,they obviously perform much greater roles than just that.andM;GL is the primary graphics library for use on the Personal Iris.andP;  Althoughnot based on any of the current standards in computer graphics, it does haveconcepts found in those standards.andP;  GL contains routines for drawing lines,polylines, points, polygons, meshes, rectangles, circles, arcs, characters,curves and surfaces.andM;The Personal Iris uses parametric cubic curves.andP;  The GL User's Guide includesdescription of how to generate Bezier, Cardinal spline and B-spline curves.andO;Surfaces are generated in a similar fashion.andM;Drawing can be done in RGB or colormap mode.andP;  Objects can have Gouraudshading applied to them.andM;Transformations can be applied, including coordinate, projection, viewing andmodeling transformations.andP;  If the Personal Iris is equipped with the optionalZ-buffer, hidden-surface removal can be turned on with a single subroutinecall: zbuffer().andP;  The Graphics Library also allows direct writing into theZ-buffer if necessary.andM;The library supports eight light sources (either local or &quot;at infinity&quot;),event-driven input, depth-cueing, anti-aliasing and display lists.andM;The Distibuted Graphics Library is really a slight superset of GL; it is ameans of distributing GL routines across a network.andP;  Essentially, it allowsthe client and server portions of a graphics application to be on separateworkstations.andP;  It can be thought of as a remote procedure call facility forthe Graphics Library.andM;The DGL facility is distinguished from GL by the addition of two subroutinecalls, dglopen and dglclose, which establish or terminate a connection to agraphics server.andP;  With the exception of these two calls, an application needto be no different for local or distributed execution.andM;Because the graphics server may in fact be a local server--running on thesame machine as the application--a single compiled version of the code can beused for local or distributed execution.andM;Finally, graphics applications can also be written in PostScript and use theNeWS window system.andP;  NeWS is implemented on the Personal Iris as a singleUnix process that acts as a network server and PostScript interpreter.andP;  Thisallows NeWS applications to be ported to the Iris from other platforms.andM;Several user applications advertised by Silicon Graphics and mentioned in thedocumentation are not yet available.andP;  Among these is WorkSpace, awindow-based interface to the Unix user environment.andM;WorkSpace, which has been delayed due to difficulties in implementation, willprovide two views of the Unix file system and allow a user to manage and usefiles completely through menus.andP;  It is meant to provide a graphical interfaceto the Unix operating system, including such tasks as user management.andM;However, because it is still unavailable, we were not able to evaluate itsusefulness.andM;Silicon Graphics does offer SoftPC from Insignia Software, a software PCemulator.andP;  With SoftPC a user can open up a DOS window through which standardPC programs can be run.andP;  The window provides CGA and monochrome displaycapabilities; the simulation has 640KB of memory and can create and use diskdevices on the Personal Iris' hard disk.andM;The DOS drive C: is mapped to a single file, which can be specified by theuser; drive D: can be mapped to a Unix directory, allowing the directoriesand files within to be used as DOS files.andM;We copied DR Labs' PC benchmarks to the Personal Iris in executable form andwere able to run them immediately, without recompilation.andM;The results, however, were not impressive.andP;  We used two Pascal programs toexamine SoftPC: PSIEVE and MPYADD.andP;  PSIEVE is an implementation of the Sieveof Eratosthenes algorithm for calculating prime numbers and can becharacterized as an integer benchmark.andP;  MPYADD performs algebraic operationson a 1,000-element single-precision floating-point array.andP;  both programs werecompiled using Microsoft Pascal and copied to the Personal Iris.andM;Personal Iris' SoftPC handled the PSIEVE benchmark fairly well; in fact, itexecuted the program 1.12 times faster than an IBM PC XT.andP;  The floating-pointmatrix benchmark, however, ran substantially slower under SoftPC--SoftPC'sperformance on MPYADD was 0.58 times as fast as the IBM PC XT.andM;PERFORMANCEandM;We had no problems porting, compiling and running DR Labs' CPU 2 Fortranbenchmark suite on the Personal Iris (Fig.andP;  7).andP;  In terms of straight CPUperformance, the Personal Iris turned in a respectable 8.40 MicroVAX II unitsof processing (MVUPs).andP;  This was shy of the performance of the Mips M/120 andDECstation 3100, because both of these use a R2000 chip running at a slightlyfaster clock speed.andM;Yet, unlike the DECstation 3100, which burdens its CPU with allgraphics-processing tasks, the Personal Iris has a dedicated, pipelinedgraphics subsystem that is tuned for graphics performance.andP;  The resultsreally need to be seen to be fully appreciated.andM;Silicon Graphics' claim to real-time 3-D graphics with light sources is avalid one.andP;  Using the Personal Iris is a pleasure.andP;  From the inside out itsdesign is exceptional, from Silicon Graphics' choice of the Mips RISC CPU tothe design of the system enclosure.andM;The entry-level price of $15,990 for a diskless Personal Iris is exceptional.andO;Even a disked system is available for less than $20,000.andP;  (See &quot;Prices,&quot; page46.)andP;  The entry-level system does not include the R2010 floating-point unit,which is priced at an additional $2,000.andM;We found Iris to be much like most other Unixes that we've used; its graphicscapabilities are still centered in the GL graphics library, and it would havebeen nice if there was more interaction between Unix and the graphics--ascreen-based editor other than vi, for example.andM;The Personal Iris provides a wonderful, low-cost environment for the use ofreal-time 3-D graphics, and it is a platform that--for the time being--hasset new standards for price/performance and graphics performance.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
