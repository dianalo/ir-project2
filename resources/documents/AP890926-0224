By a vote of 66-34, the Senate rejected an amendment that wouldhave restored that sum to Bush's Star Wars program to meet the $4.5billion total approved by the chamber in its authorization billpassed in August.   Instead, the Senate accepted a total for the Strategic DefenseInitiative that falls about $900 million short of Bush's requestfor the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   The spending bill's total is about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billionfor the Pentagon's SDI program and $355 million for the EnergyDepartment and military construction.   The Senate accepted those totals on a voice vote and continueddebate on the bill, which was expected to take several days.   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the Armed ServicesCommittee who voted against restoring the $300 million, said``there isn't any question'' that suport for SDI is ``extremelyweak'' in the Senate.   Later, the Senate rejected, 71-29, an amendment that would havecut $2.7 billion from Bush's request for $4.7 billion next year tobuy and test the first 13 models of the B-2 stealth bomber.   Proponents of the bat-winged aircraft argued that a U.S.-Soviettreaty reducing strategic arms would be impossible without theplane. Opponents complained that the cost of $530 million for eachof 132 planned bombers was excessive.   During a session that lasted late into the night, the Senateapproved by a vote of 65-34 a non-binding resolution calling onBush to report to Congress before April 1, 1990 on the U.S.military's presence in South Korea. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., hadproposed a reduction of 3,000 in the 43,800 U.S. troops stationedin the Asian nation, but the ``sense of Congress'' measure wasadopted instead.   Earlier in the day, the Senate overwhelmingly endorsed shuttingdown 86 military bases and scaling down five more, approving thecost-saving plan to close bases. The vote was 86-14.   The Senate totals for Star Wars are still far more than what wasapproved by the House _ $3.1 billion _ and the House has notcompromised on the issue, according to one Senate negotiator.   ``It's now clear that the House is not about to accept thenumber that the authorizers agreed to in our bill,'' said Sen. AlanDixon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   The defeated amendment, sponsored by Republican Sens. JohnWarner of Virginia and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, also included aseries of changes to the bill approved by the AppropriationsCommittee.   Warner and Wallop would have restored $910 million for thesubmarine-based, long-range Trident 2 nuclear issile, reduced fundsfor the Apache helicopter and earmarked $395 million forconventional weapons such as Stinger, TOW and HARM missiles.   The defeated amendment also would have reduced the money forfast transport ships from $1 billion to $20 million and providedmoney for one rather than two icebreakers.   On Star Wars, Wallop had argued that the increase in thesubstitute amendment would have provided ``barely a minimum tosustain confidence'' in the program.   The House, according to Wallop, ``funded it at a level which itcannot succeed. What they are doing to the American people is lyingto them.''   But Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the amount for Star Warswas a ``prudent position considering the current status of thatprogram.'' And Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., noted that the Sovietsthis past weekend indicated that they were divorcing Star Wars fromany U.S.-Soviet treaty to reduce strategic arms.   ``The Soviets are not so concerned about SDI anymore,'' Johnstonsaid.   In other action, the Senate approved:   _Transferring $135 million from the Defense Department to theEnergy Department for the restart of the three tritium reactors atthe Savannah River nuclear plant.   _Providing $20 million in military assistance for Jordan. Thisamendment was introduced at the request of Bush and approved byvoice vote.   _Approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in theCaribbean and United States damaged last week by Hurricane Hugo.The total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available butSen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the plan's sponsor, said that $50million was for a Navy shipyard in Charleston and $25 million wasfor Shaw Air Force Base.   On base closings, the Senate approved an amendment thateffectively eliminates a provision that would have held up $300million for the base closings until the General Accounting Officecertified that the savings exceeded the cost.   A federal commission, in making its recommendation lastDecember, estimated a savings of $5.6 billion over 20 years. ThenDefense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci accepted the panel's plan andthe House last spring upheld the proposal.   The Senate action on the measure sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, camedespite appeals from a handful of members petitioning on behalf oftheir home-state bases.   Prior to the Senate action, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney saidfurther cuts in the defense budget by the Democratic-controlledCongress may force him to close more bases.   ``Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defensebudget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to closeadditional bases,'' Cheney told reporters the day after SenateDemocrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement toboost President Bush's anti-drug effort by $900 million. The planrequires a cut of about $1.3 billion in the Pentagon budget.   In te debate over base closings, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii,argued that a mistake had been made and the provision simply asks``that the comptroller general analyze.''   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., who has fought plans to close ChanuteAir Force Base near Rantoul, Ill., charged that the commission``cooked the books.''   Behind the scenes, the lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs and Blowurged members to vote against the Nunn amendment.
