Introduction Trade Liberalization Priorities </ITAG>This report is submitted pursuant to section 310 of the Trade Act of 1974,as amended (19 USC 2420), popularly known as ``Super 301.'' Section 310requres the United State Trade Representative to identify trade liberalizationpriorities, including priority practices and countries that will be a focusor negotiations in 1989 and 1990 to broaden access for U.S. exports toforeign markets. The first step in the Super 301 process was preparation of the NationalTrade Estimate (NTE) Report, which contains an inventory of practices affectinggoods, services, investment, and intellectual property protection in 34nations and two regional trading blocs. The NTE Report was submitted tothe President and appropriate committees of the Senate and House of Representativeson April 28, 1989. Using the NTE as a basis, and taking into account comments from the privatesector, the USTR is required to identify foreign trade practices the eliminationof which is likely to significantly increase U.S. exports. The statutealso directs the USTR to identify priority countries, taking into accountthe number and pervasiveness of significant barriers to U.S. exports. ByJune 15 the USTR must initiate investigations under section 302 of theTrade Act of 1974, as amended, of priority practices of priority countries.In implementing section 310, the Administration will aim to eliminate significanttrade barriers and trade-distorting practices through multilateral andbilateral negotiations_not simply to increase U.S. exports, but to liberalizetrade for the benefit of all nations. This approach is consistent with the Administration's overall trade policy,which is to open markets not close them; to create an ever-expanding internationaltrading system based upon clear and enforceable rules. Accordingly, the highest trade liberalization priority identified by theUSTR is to conclude successfully the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations by December 1990. In those negotiations the United Statesseeks to achieve multilateral agricultural reform, to expand the scopeof international rules to include trade in services, protection of intellectualproperty rights and trade-related investment measures, and to reduce oreliminate a wide variety of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Section 301 is a tool the Administration will use constructively to promoteits trade policy objective. Its purpose is not to retaliate, but to providenegotiating leverage to remove trade barriers. Therefore, the Administrationwill initiate section 302 investigations selectively, where the leverageprovided by the credible threat of retaliation will encourage its tradingpartners to honor existing agreements, and to abide by, or expand, GATTrules.Accordingly, the USTR has identified the following priority practices andcountries, which will be the subject of investigation and negotiation inthis year's Super 301 process: andbullet; <T3>Quantitative import restrictions_</T3>including import bans, quotas,and restrictive licensing regimes that inhibit imports of manufacturedand agricultural products. Such practices in Brazil will be given priorityattention. andbullet; <T3>Exclusionary government procurement</T3>_where governments have adoptedpolicies and practices that afford protection to domestic products andexclude foreign suppliers. Such practices affecting Japan's procurementof satellites and supercomputers will be given priority attention.andbullet; <T3>Technical barriers to trade</T3>_where governments have adopted trade-restrictivetechnical standards and regulations that create unnecessary obstacles tointernational trade. Such standards affecting imports of forest productsin Japan will be given priority attention.andbullet; <T3>Trade-related investment measures</T3>_including requirements governmentsplace on foreign investors to export a portion of what they produce, orto use locally-produced inputs, and other trade-distorting reqirements.Such practices in India will be given priority attention. andbullet; <T3>Barriers to trade in services</T3>_including government measures whichprevent U.S. services industries from competing effectively in foreignmarkets. India's market, competely closed to foreign insurance companies,will be given priority attention. Identification of these priority practices was based upon a number of considerations,including:<ITAG tagnum="15">_the potential to increase U.S. exports if these practices are eliminated;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_the precedential effect of seeking and obtaining their elimination;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_the likelihood that 302 investigations would advance U.S. effortsto eliminate these practices; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_the compatibility with U.S. objectives in the Uruguay Round.</ITAG>Identificaiton of priority countries took into account the number and pervasivenessof significant barriers to U.S. exports.As was noted in the NTE Report, it is extremely difficult to estimate howmuch U.S. exports would increase if a non-tariff barrier to trade wereremoved. Estimating the trade impact of such barriers requires detailedinformation on price differences between countries and relevant supplyand demand conditions, which is not readily available. Such informationnormally is gathered in the course of an investigation under section 302,in order to assess the burden or restriction on U.S. commerce caused bya particular foreign barrier.The five categories of trade barriers identified above_and the individualcountries' practices selected as representative of each category_do notencompass all of the major trade distortions facing American exporters,but they are among the most important.A sixth category, intellectual property protection, is being addressedseparately but simultaneously through the ``Special 301'' process undersection 182 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 USC 2242). All sixcategories include practices the elimination of which is likely to havesignificant potential to increase U.S. exports, either directly or throughestablishing a beneficial precedent.Many other trade barriers, including those listed in the NTE Report, areand will continue to be addressed in on-going negotiations with our tradingpartners. Principal among them are trade-distorting subsidies and agriculturalpolicies. These practices are no less important than those identified aspriority practices under the statute. However, the Administration has determinedthat their elimination can be better pursued at this time outside of section301, especially through multilateral negotiations in the Uruguay Round.The Administration also will continue to pursue trade barriers alreadythe subject of investigations, negotiations, and action under section 301including, for example, Japan's practices affecting construction servicesand semiconductors.Industries are free at any time to file petitions requesting 302 investigations;historically, most such petitions have been accepted by the USTR. Thus,additional investigations are likely to be initiated_either as the resultof industries' petitions, or self-initiated by the USTR_during the comingyear.Finally, in implementing Section 310 next year, USTR will reevaluate thestatus of certain practices not identified this year, in light of progressmade in bilateral and multilateral negotiations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Priorities Under the Statute: Section 302 Investigations</ITAG>The Administration's approach to Super 301 consists of a number of componentsthat are integral parts of a comprehensive package. Super 301 is not simplyan exercise in identifying specific practices or countries; rather it isone element of a broader strategy aimed at economic growth through tradeexpansion. The Super 301 process supports this strategy by concentratingU.S. efforts this year on the elimination of practices that, in additionto being serious barriers in themselves, are indicative of broader areasof concern. This approach enables the United States to advance generaltrade policy objectives through concrete, focused initiatives.In accordance with the statute, the USTR will initiate by June 15 investigationsunder section 302 of the Trade Act on the priority practices of prioritycountries (Japan, Brazil, and India) identified below under Section 301.These investigations will include fact-finding, consultations with U.S.industry representatives, consultations with U.S. trading partners, and,where appropriate, reference to GATT dispute settlement panels.In consultations with these trading partners, the United States will seekagreements to eliminate these priority practices within three years. Ifthe investigatory and consultative period (12 to 18 months, depending onthe nature of the investigation) does not produce favorable results, theUSTR will determine whether a practice is actionable under section 301and, if so, what action (if any) should be taken.Initiation of an investigation does not prejudge a decision whether a practiceis ``unfair'' or whether section 301 action would be effective in addressingit. The following specific practices will be investigated, and addressedin parallel with broader negotiations aimed at the generic problems ofwhich these practices are emblematic:A. Quantitative Import Restricts, Import Bans and Restrictive LicensingAn important U.S. priority is the eliminatioin of GATT-inconsistent quotasand licensing restrictions on imports. Such measures cause particular concernwith respect to U.S. agricultural exports.While quotas and restrictive licensing are becoming globally less pervasive,they continue to impede U.S. exports to a number of developing countriesthat claim their restrictions are justified under the balance-of-paymentsprovisions of GATT Article XVIII:B. In some cases governments have imposedimport bans which impair regular channels of trade and which are not progressivelyrelaxed, as required by GATT rules. Moreover, some countries restrict importsthrough licensing products of particular industries, rather than imposinggeneral balance-of-payments measures, contrary to a 1979 GATT Declarationon Trade Measures Taken for Balance-of-Payments Purposes.In Uruguay Round negotiations the United States is seeking to strengthenand clarify the requirements of Article XVIII, to ensure that they areused as a temporary derogation from GATT obligations, rather than an open-endedmechanism to protect particular industries with measures that would otherwisebe GATT-inconsistent. U.S. objectives include explicit requirements thatmeasures taken for balance-of-payments reasons be temporary, transparent,and uniformly applied to all products, and that tariff measures be preferredover quantitative restrictions.To support its Uruguay Round efforts, the United States will use all availableGATT mechanisms to challenge balance-of-payments import restrictions thatthe United States believes run counter to GATT obligations.The following import bans and other import restrictions are identifiedas a prirority practice under section 310:<ITAG tagnum="81">Brazil: Import Bans and Other Import Licensing Restrictions</ITAG>Brazil maintains an import prohibition list which covers approximately1000 items, barring U.S. exports of agricultural items and manufacturedgoods, including meat, dairy products, plastics, chemicals, textiles, leatherproducts, electronic items, motor vehicles, and furniture. Brazil alsouses its licensing regime to implement company and sectoral import quotas,which impede many important U.S. export items, including office machineparts, internal combustion engine parts, and electrical machinery.The lack of transparency of Brazil's licensing system inhibits marketsaccess and creates uncertainty for U.S. exporters to Brazil. Brazil maintainsthese restrictions despite GATT requirements with respect to restrictiveimport measures imposed for balance-of-payments purposes, including theprinciple that such measures should not be used to protect a particularindustry or sector.B. Exclusionary Government ProcurementBecause governments are among the largest purchasers of goods and servicesin the world, the United States is working to ensure that opportunitiesto sell to governments are available to U.S. suppliers. In multilateralnegotiations the United States seeks, on a reciprocal basis, the use ofprocedures that require government procurement decisions to be made ona competitive and non-discriminatory basis. The United States also seekselimination of specific procurement practices that exclude foreign suppliers.The following exclusionary government procurement practices are identifiedas priority practices under section 310:<ITAG tagnum="81">Japan: Ban on Government Procurement of Foreign Satellites</ITAG>As part of a ``long range vision on space development'' Japan prohibitsthe procurement of foreign satellites by government entities if such apurchase interferes with ``indigenous development objectives.'' Japan'spolicy of promoting indigenous production capability by prohibiting governmentprocurement of foreign satellites applies to the entire range of satellites(broadcast, communications, earth resource, weather). The United Stateshas long been the world leader in satellite production, and is thus deniedsignificant market opportunities by this policy.<ITAG tagnum="81">Japan: Exclusionary Procurement of Supercomputers</ITAG>The United States supercomputer industry has been effectively denied accessto the Japanese public sector market despite a 1987 agreement with Japanon supercomputers. The Government of Japan has engaged in a variety ofexclusionary practices that have the effect of thwarting the open procurementprocess, in order to ensure purchase of supercomputers by indigenous producers.C. Technical Barries to TradeThe United States places high priority on the elimination of trade-restrictivetechnical regulations and standards. While many legitimate reasons existfor governments to use standards_such as the protection of plant, animal,and human life, or the prevention of consumer fraud_governments sometimesimpose technical standards that unnecessarily restrict imports. The EuropeanCommunity's ban on hormone-treated beef, already subject to countermeasuresunder section 301, is an example where unreasonable standards (in thatcase, not based on any legitimate scientific judgment) have created unnecessarytrade barriers.The GATT Agreement on Technical Barries to Trade (``Standards Code'') commitsits signatories to ensure that technical regulations or standards, andrelated testing and certification schemes, do not create unnecessary obstaclesto trade. While the Standards Code has improved the standards-related activitiesof many countries, an important Uruguay Round objective for the UnitedStates is to strengthen and expand the Code further. The administrationalso places high priority on ensuring that Code signatories abide by existingCode obligations.The following standards-related practices of Japan have been identifiedas a priority practice under section 310:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Japan: Restrictive Standards on Wood Products  </ITAG>Access to Japan's market for forest products is impeded by a variety oftariff and non-tariff measures, including technical standards which favorJapanese producers. These practices include wood grading requirements whichdiscriminate against U.S. wood products, as well as a variety of testingstandards which impede U.S. exports. Japan maintains these practices despiteits obligations under the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Tradeto ensure that technical regulations and standards are not adopted or appliedin a way which creates unnecessary obstacles to international trade.  D. Trade-Related Investment Measures  The United States supports open investment policies worldwide; all nationswill benefit from unrestricted foreign direct investment. In the UruguayRound, the United States is seeking the elimination of trade-restrictingmeasures imposed by government upon foreign investors. The result of suchmeasures is the distortion of import, export, and manufacturing patternsthat would occur absent government intervention, impairing the abilityof an enterprise to respond to developments in the marketplace. The UnitedStates has made investment restrictions a priority in both bilateral andmultilateral negotiations.  The following practice, exemplary of an investment regime that seriouslydistorts trade, is identified as a priority practice under section 310; <ITAG tagnum="81">India: Trade-Related Investment Measures  </ITAG>Government approval is required for all new or expanded foreign investmentin India. Approval is conditioned upon a number of criteria, includingrequirements for foreign equity participation. Where approval is granted,the Indian Government often requires investors to use locally-producedgoods in the items they produce in India, rather than allowing them toimport the best quality and most cost-effective products. Some investorsare also required to meet export targets. Such ``performance requirements''burden foreign investors, and result in significant trade distortions.  E. Barriers to Trade in Services  Establishment of a comprehensive GATT agreement on trade in services isone of the key U.S. objectives in the Urugray Round. The need for multilateralrules and disciplines covering services trade has become increasingly importantas services have grown as a share of total world economic activity. Inthe Uruguay Round the United States has strongly supported efforts to establisha multilateral framework of principles and rules for services trade, aswell as mechanisms for the progressive liberalization of services barriers.The services text adopted by Trade Ministers at the December 1988 UruguayRound Mid-Term Review in Montreal does much to advance the eventual achievementof these objectives.  In the absence of multilateral rules on services trade, the United Stateshas pursued the liberalization of foreign services markets through bilateralnegotiations. In free-trade agreements with both Canada and Israel, bilateralagreement was reached on fundamental principals governing trade in services.In regotiations with Korea, initiated as part of a section 302 investigationin 1985, U.S. negotiators achieved a considerable liberalization of Korea'sinsurance market. Such bilateral initiatives support and reinforce multilateralefforts to liberalize trade in services.The following barrier to trade in services is identified as a prioritypractice under section 310:<ITAG tagnum="81">India: Insurance Market Barriers</ITAG>Private insurance companies are not permitted to sell insurance in India.The state-owned General Insurance Company of India and its four subsidiarieshave a monopoly on sales of general insurance, and the Life Insurance Corporationof India has a monopoly on the sale of life insurance. India's is the largestremaining closed insurance market; liberalization of that market wouldcreate significant market opportunities for U.S. insurance companies, whichare competitive worldwide.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Other Negotiating Priorities</ITAG>Section 301 is an important market-opening tool, but it is not a substitutefor multilateral negotiations. A key priority of U.S. trade policy is asuccessful outcome in the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations.While the Administration is prepared to use section 301, the preferredlong-term solution is to achieve improvements in multilateral disciplinesand enforcement procedures in the Uruguay Round.Many trade issues may be better resolved through multilateral agreementsunder GATT auspices than bilateral initiatives. Because GATT negotiationsinvolve a broad range of issues and sectors, they facilitate a comprehensiveapproach to resolving a number of interrelated issues. In addition, itis often difficult for governments to agree to eliminate a trade barrierin bilateral negotiations, when other countries can act as ``free riders''and take advantage of a more open trading situation without making equivalentconcessions.Thus, some problems, like agricultural subsidies, are difficult to solveabsent broad multilateral agreement, since any government that agrees toeliminate subsidies in a bilateral agreement places its producers at acompetitive disadvantage with respect to countries that have not assumeda similar obligation.In this respect, the USTR has determined that certain practices, whileimportant U.S. negotiating priorities, will be better pursued at this timeoutside of section 301, especially through multilateral negotiations inthe Uruguay Round.Agricultural practices in this category include:andbullet; European Community variable levies on imports of grains, sugar,dairy products, beef, poultry, eggs, pork and processed products made fromthese commodities, which afford protection to European producers of theseproducts, adversely affecting U.S. exports to the EC.andbullet; European Community agricultural export subsidies. The EC grantsexport ``restitutions'' on a wide range of agricultural products includingwheat, wheat flour, beef, dairy products, poultry, and certain fruits,as well as some processed products. The result of such subsidies is downwardpressure on world agricultural prices and unfair competition for U.S. exportersin third country markets.andbullet; Japan's import barriers on rice. Japan's strict prohibition onthe import of rice adversely affects U.S. rice producers and exporters,and is unjustifiable in light of Japan's GATT obligations.U.S. priorities in the Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations include theelimination of all trade-distorting subsidies and market access barriers.Thus, elimination of practices such as the variable levy, export subsidiesand Japan's rice ban will be pursued in these negotiations.Another issue better addressed outside of section 301 at the present timeis the substantial financial support European Airbus partner governmentshave provided to their <T3>Airbus consortium </T3>member companies. These supports have takenthe form of ``soft'' loans, loan guarantees, general equity infusions and,more recently, a proposal for exchange rate guarantees. These practiceshave heavily subsidized both Airbus aircraft development and production,distorting world aircraft trade and threatening to cause serious prejudiceto future U.S. aircraft exports. These practices will be pursued activelyin both bilateral and multilateral fora.The United States will continue to pursue negotiations in the Uruguay Roundaimed at eliminating these trade-distorting practices and their effectson U.S. exports; and the USTR will assess the progress made toward thatgoal in the context of next year's Super 301 process.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Section 310(a)(1)(D) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended,19 U.S.C. 2420(a)(1)(D).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joshua B.
