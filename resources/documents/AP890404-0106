She said that last month Richard Melton, a department envoy,discussed with Haitian President Prosper Avril ``the broad range ofU.S. interests in Haiti, which would include narcotic cooperation,along with democratic reforms, respect for human rights andcredible development programs.''   ``We did not deliver any list of names; nor did we give any kindof ultimatum,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   She said was unable to comment on the announcement by Haitianstate television that the three military commanders who led thecoup attempt had been given safe passage to the United States viathe Dominican Republic.   Asked whether the trio had sought asylum in the United States,Ms. Tutwiler said, ``Not that I'm aware of.''   Haitian radio had reported Thursday that four high-ranking armyofficers were discharged for drug trafficking a day after Meltonhad tied the resumption of U.S. aid to progress in stopping thedrug trade.   A $90 million U.S. aid package was suspended after November 1987elections were aborted by thugs protected by soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
