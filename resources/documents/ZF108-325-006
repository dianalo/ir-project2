Type 1 fonts with hints will be ready inMay, the company said, adding that its storage requirements for PostScriptformats remains consistent with the needs of its proprietary format (1.5 MBfor a Chinese font).andM;DynaLab disclosed that it has had preliminary discussions with Microsoft thatindicated that its proprietary font format is very similar to Apple'sTrueType (Royal) format, so it expects to be able to provide TrueType fontsrather easily.andM;The company.andP;  DynaLab, which currently employs 85 people (including 40artists and 30 engineers), is headed by Fisher Lee, who served formerly aspresident of Digital Equipment's Taiwanese operation.andP;  The company's DynaFonttechnology was developed in 1984 as an independent part of China ComputerCompany.andP;  DynaLab Taiwan Inc. was established in 1987 with a 24-person staff.andM;It has been licensing its fonts and technology to major Japanese and Chinesecomputer and typesetting equipment manufacturers for the past year.andP;  They arealso in use with some Japanese word processing systems.andP;  DynaLab says itssystem is compatible with Microsoft's C-Windows (the Chinese version ofWindows) and C-DOS (the Chinese version of MS-DOS).andM;The company expects to announce soon an order for 250,000 units.andM;DynaLab currently is looking for assistance in understanding and servingwestern markets.andM;Varityper: Kanji on Series 4000andM;Varityper used the Seminars as the U.S.andP;  introduction of a Kanji version ofits Series 4000 imagesetter using an Adobe PostScript RIP.andP;  The world debutoccurred at the IGAS show in Japan last fall.andP;  Two fonts, each containingabout 7,000 ideographic characters, are currently available: Ryumin light andGothic BBB medium.andP;  These are built into the Adobe RIP package.andP;  Screen fontsare supplied as part of the Macintosh Kanji operating system.andP;  Coming soonare bold Mincho, bold Gothic and round-cornered Gothic.andM;The system has been in beta testing since October in Japan, where initialdeliveries are about to begin.andP;  In the U.S., first installations will takeplace in the second quarter.andP;  The U.S.andP;  price is $12,995, factory installedas an add-on to a Series 4000 controller.andP;  To upgrade an existing system inthe field is expected to cost about $ 16,000.andM;We believe Varityper is the first of the PostScript imagesetter vendors totackle Kanji in the U.S., where support and service are more difficult thanthey are in Japan.andP;  Rather than require its support personnel to learnJapanese to aid in locating troubles with malfunctioning systems, Varitypersaid its support team will adopt a standard test to be administered when themachine is installed and at any other time a service technician is called tothe site.andP;  If the machine passes this test, Varityper will presume that theproblem lies elsewhere.andP;  This approach may bring on some frustration amongcustomers who want quick answers, but if the test is well constructed, it maybe a reasonable course.andM;Island Graphics: Kanji SunWriteandM;Island Graphics demonstrated Japanese versions of its SunWrite, SunDraw andSunPaint programs on Sun-4 workstations, running within the same OpenLookgraphical user interface as the English version that has been available sincelast year.andP;  The programs were converted from English to Japanese by UnisolCorp. of Tokyo, which will handle them in Japan starting on April 1.andP;  Unisol,which is owned jointly by Fuji Xerox and Sun Microsystems, will sell themthrough its distribution channels.andM;System functionality is the same as the English SunWrite program, with theobvious exception of the Japanese element.andM;One Sun window, at the bottom of the screen, is used for creating Japanesecharacters.andP;  The operator enters the mode designed for typing in the windowand strikes the appropriate keys to generate hiragana characters in thewindow.andP;  Another command converts the hiragana to Kanji, which can beinserted into the text file at the cursor location.andM;In version 1.0, which was shown in Boston, Japanese characters are restrictedto horizontal alignment.andP;  However, Island said that version 2 should supportmixing horizontal and vertical text on the same page, as is often required inJapanese.andM;The Japanese version runs on the same hardware as its English counterpart(Sun-3, Sun-4 and Sparcstation platforms), but it requires Sun's JapaneseLanguage Environment (JLE) to support Japanese characters.andP;  Two Japanesefonts are available: modern and classic, which use a total of about 10 MB ofstorage.andM;Pricing of the Japanese version will be about the same as for the Englishones: $595 for SunWrite or about $1,000 for all three.andP;  That would make theproduct very attractive compared to the Japanese versions of most otherU.S.-developed publishing software in Japan.andM;Solustan innovative in Indian languagesandM;Circle Noetic Services shared its space with Solustan, which has developed aprogram for handling many of the common scripts for Indian languages.andP;  It wasdemonstrated running with Macintosh and PC applications.andP;  Also shown washyphenation of 16 European languages within Ventura Publisher, using newversions of the hyphenation programs it developed earlier for the Macintosh.andM;Solustan has created a program called Kalam (named for the Sanskrit word fora writing instrument) that runs in standard Macintosh or PC workstations.andP;  AMac version called MacKalam works as a desk accessory and currently supportsfour Indian scripts used in seven languages, with two more coming soon.andP;  Morethan just a character generator, MacKalam employs interesting approaches tothe common problems of these languages: streamlining keyboard operations,creating thousands of conjunct characters, and finding appropriate places tobreak lines.andM;Conjunct characters.andP;  An important characteristic of Indian scripts is thatthey combine consonants in a variety of ways to create thousands of&quot;conjunct&quot; characters.andP;  Some of the most common ones are formed by taking theleft half of one consonant and attaching it to another consonant, but many ofthem require nearly complete redesigns of the two or more characters thatmake up the conjunct.andM;To create these conjunct characters, Indian typesetting systems traditionallyhave employed four-level keyboards that include the full consonants, halfconsonants and a large number of special characters.andP;  This method has beenable to produce several hundred conjuncts, but nowhere near the number neededfor high-quality work.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  5, p. 22 for a diagramillustrating Compugraphic's Devanagari layout.)andM;New Keyboard and access method.andP;  Solustan has taken a different approach tokeyboard layout and generation of conjunct characters.andP;  Rather than use afour-level keyboard, it has adopted the standard keyboard layout thatresulted from a study sponsored by the Indian government's Department ofElectronics in 1984-85.andP;  (Most other vendors designed their systems longbefore this standard was created.)andM;The new standard generally uses only two levels, which might seem to restrictit to the point of not accommodating all of the necessary characters.andO;However, instead of providing two separate keys for a full consonant and ahalf consonant, as is the case with the old-style keyboards, the new methodemploys the full consonant even when only half is required, with a &quot;link&quot; keytyped to indicate that the preceding consonant is to be used in itshalf-consonant (or other conjunct) form, linked to the next consonant.andP;  Thesystem then accesses the appropriate conjunct character from the frontdatabase, whether it is merely the half-consonant character followed by thefull consonant, or whether it is a radically different design.andM;In other words, typists arebeing retrained to use the link key (in theposition of the lower-case D on a QWERTY keyboard) instead of the largenumber of half-consonant keys that traditionally have been used.andM;Using this method, Solustan says, it can generate a few thousand differentconjunct characters.andP;  It also implements a syntax check to prevent theoperator from creating illegal characters--something we didn't test.andM;That isn't the only retraining being done.andP;  The main keys have been moved tolocations believed to be more efficient for touch typing.andP;  The consonantsgenerally appear on the right and the vowels on the left.andP;  (The ability tochange keyboard layouts is a luxury not all societies have.andP;  Fortunately, theIndian population hadn't had one keyboard layout firmly entrenched in itsbusiness and educational environments.)andM;For speed typing, a few conjunct characters also appear on the keyboard,althugh they can be accessed also by typing the full consonants and the linkkey.andM;Font access.andP;  The fundamental change that enables this new method, of course,is the use of stored fonts and lookup tables to produce the right conjunctcharacter for the specific pair (or larger group) of consonants that isstruck by the typist.andP;  Solustan says it needs 182 basic elements for mostIndian scripts, which works fine with programs that accommodate up to 256, asmost Macintosh applications do.andP;  For Sanskrit, which uses more conjunctcharacters than the other languages, 225 basic elements are needed, whichmeans that Ventura Publisher can't handle it properly.andP;  (Ventura is limitedto 192 characters per font.)andM;Another nice feature of this new method is that most keystrokes are typed inthe order in which the same characters are written by hand.andP;  This is an issuebecause some vowels in Indian languages appear either above or below theconsonant they are associated with, which makes them similar to accents inEuropean languages.andP;  That is, they don't require movement of the outputdevice.andP;  The way this situation has been handled traditionally is to type thevowel first because it doesn't cause movement of the typewriter carriage, andthen to type the consonant, which results in advancing the mechanism to getready for the next character.andM;With Solustan's system, the consonant is typed first and the vowel second,with the system taking care of placement.andM;Another nice touch being added by Solustan is the deletion of a conjunctcharacter with a single keystroke, rather than element by element, as otherprograms generally implement deletions.andM;The scripts that Solustan has completed are Devanagari (used for Hindi,Nepali, Marathi and Sanskrit), Gujarati, Tamil and Malayalam; Bengali andGurmukhi are nearly ready for release.andP;  Each script comes with four faces:normal, italic, bold and bold italic.andM;Both Arabic and Indian numbering systems are supported.andP;  The user chooses onefor each occasion.andM;Fonts currently used are in Type 3 PostScript format, but Solustan says itwill convert them to Type 1 within a month after the Seminars.andM;Determining line breaks.andP;  In these languages, it is permissible to break aline in the middle of a word, if an acceptable point is used.andP;  In all of themexcept Malayalam and Tamil, a hyphen is inserted at the point a word isbroken.andP;  (Malayalam and Tamil break the words in the same places but don'tuse a hyphen.)andP;  According to Solutan, the main situations to avoid arebreaking a unit (consisting of a consonant or a conjunct character and itsassociated vowel) and hyphenating a word with fewer than two such unitsbefore or after the hyphen.andM;Solustan says its algorithm prevents breaking a unit and ensures that atleast two units precede and follow a line break.andP;  We didn't have a chance totest that feature, and we aren't sure how MacKalam interacts with the variouspage composition programs it runs with.andM;Mac version.andP;  The Macintosh version runs as a desk accessory with a Mac SE orII.andP;  With a Plus, it runs as a standalone word processing program, calledMacKalam, using Indian scripts.andP;  The operator pulls down a menu listing theavailable languages and selects one.andP;  The keyboard then becomes an Indiankeyboaord nwith stick-on keycaps available) and the screen displays theIndian characters.andP;  It is possible to mix English and multiple Indian scriptsin the same job.andP;  Each language requires 40K of storage, although only oneIndian script can be used at a time.andP;  (The desk accessory manages thememory.)andM;Solustan was demonstrating ReadySetGo using Kalam, but it said the programworks equally well with PageMaker, QuarkXpress and other common applications.andM;MacKalam runs in any current Macintosh.andP;  A hard disk isn't required, but itis recommended because of the memory-intensive, graphic-oriented Indianscripts.andM;PC Version.andP;  The PC version runs within the Gem operating environment.andO;Solustan demonstrated it with Ventura Publisher and Delrina Technology'sPerForm, but said it also supports Logitech's Finesse and Timeworks'Publish-It composition programs, plus other Gem applications.andP;  (Finesse comesbundled with the keyboard and screen-display software as a word processor.)andO;English and one other language are available within any job.andP;  Keyboardcommands are used to switch between languages within a job.andM;Kalam requires a PC with 640K of memory (of which 40K is used for one Indianscript); CGA, EGA, VGA or Hercules graphics controller; monochrome or colormonitor; and two floppy disk drives or one floppy and one hard disk.andP;  Itdrives PostScript machines plus the HP LaserJet and DeskJet and most 9- and24-pin dot-matrix printers.andM;Distribution.andP;  Solustan operates its main sales and support business from itsheadquarters in Needham, MA.andP;  It is planning to open an office in India,where it obviously will find its largest market.andP;  In the United Kingdom, itis represented by Polydiam, which will demonstrate Kalam on its stand atDrupa.andP;  Solustan is looking for distribution channels in South Africa.andM;There are obviously a lot of Indians in western countries, but the entirewestern market is a drop in a bucket compared to the Indian subcontinent,even with its hundred of languages and diverse cultures.andP;  We haven't seen anyofficial statics regarding automation of typesetting in India, but Solustangave us its figures, which are mind-boggling.andP;  According to Solustan, Indiahas 6,000 daily and weekly newspapers, 20,000 magazines, and between 200,000and 300,000 type shops.andP;  Of these enterprises, only three to five percenthave been automated.andM;The problem, of course, is that the country is relatively poor andtypesetting equipment is expensive, particularly with the heavy import taxlevied by Indian governments for decades.andP;  In recent years, though, the taxeshave been reduced and government support of automated publishing hasincreased, suggesting that this market may open up considerably in the nearfuture.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
