Layne, directorof the AIM program office at NASA headquarters in Washington.andM;That autonomy raised software development and maintenance costs.andP;  Sometimesadministrative data was inconsistent between installations.andP;  And employeesworking on property management, for example, found it hard to accessprocurement management data.andM;NASA headquarters also had trouble putting data processing policies in place,Layne said.andP;  Pay processing procedures, for example, had to be written intothe software differently at each installation.andM;Under the AIM program, all installations will use the same 17 systems tomanage property, personnel, facilities, procurement and financialinformation.andM;The nine sites are Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.; Ames ResearchCenter, Mountain View, Calif.; Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va.; LewisResearch Center, Cleveland; Johnson Space Center, Houston; Kennedy SpaceCenter, Cape Canaveral, Fla.; Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.;andO;Stennis Space Center in Mississippi; and NASA headquarters.andM;NASA will spend $13 million on AIM this year, Layne said.andM;All 17 standard systems will run on IBM Corp. or IBM-compatible machines witha minimum 3090-class configuration, Layne said.andP;  NASA plans to use existinghardware, mostly from Amdahl Corp.andP;  Software is being developed withAdabas/Natural from Software AG of North America Inc. in Reston, Va.andM;Five of the standard systems already have been installed, Layne said.andP;  Twoproperty management systems, the Equipment Management System and theMetrology Information System, both developed by Planning Research Corp. (PRC)of McLean, Va., are running at NASA headquarters.andP;  PRC also developed the ADPBudget System for headquarters.andM;Another headquarters information resources management system, the AerospaceResearch Information Network, was developed by RMS Associates of Landover,Md.andP;  EGandamp;G Inc., Wellesley, Mass., developed the Facilities Management System,installed at Kennedy.andM;Layne said she expects to have all 17 systems up and running in five years.andO;But by then, some of the systems already installed will be due formodernization.andM;Layne described AIM as a continuous program that will go on indefinitely.andM;&quot;Our objective is not to try to do everything at once but to implement inphases,&quot; she said.andM;Besides setting common software and hardware standards, AIM also establishesstandard procedures for administrative functions.andP;  &quot;NASA centers do thingsvery differently from each other,&quot; Layne said.andP;  &quot;Part of the program is toagree on common ways of doing things so you can write software to supportthem.&quot;andM;To avoid alienating users, AIM program officials called on them to helpdevelop the standard systems.andP;  Workers from each installation formedcommittees to develop and review requirements and approve systems.andP;  &quot;The ADPtypes here [in the program office] don't go off in a room, develop a systemand shove it under the door to the users,&quot; Layne said.andM;&quot;The people on the user committees provide really valuable input.andP;  Of course,when you have nine separate installations, you are going to have nineseparate views of the world.andP;  Then you have to come to some agreements.andP;  Wetry to design for maximum flexibility to let users do business the way theywant to.andP;  But some things have to have a uniform approach, like data elementsand reports.&quot;andM;On rare occasions when installations disagree, headquarters officials act asreferees, Layne said.andM;Next year program officials will begin designing an integrated informationarchitecture that will allow managers in any administrative area to retrieveinformation from other areas.andP;  &quot;Ultimately, top managers will get informationacross all systems from procurement and personnel to accounting,&quot; Layne said.andM;However, some of the systems already installed will have to be redesigned forthat new framework.andM;Systems now in development or project definition phases include the SupplyManagement System to be installed at Marshall and the NASA Property DisposalManagement System planned for Goddard.andM;Their respective developers are Boeing Computer Services of Seattle andComputer Based Systems Inc. of Fairfax, Va.andM;Work on another property management system, the ADP Equipment InventorySystem, has been suspended temporarily due to budget considerations, Laynesaid.andM;Layne said the program office issued no requests for proposals for any ofthese administrative systems.andP;  Their development is under existing NASAcontracts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
