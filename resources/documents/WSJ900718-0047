The measure, adopted 24-4, bears the strong stamp ofChairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). In the absence of a formalbudget resolution, it will set the limits for spending billscovering almost half of the federal budget for the fiscalyear beginning Oct. 1.</LP><TEXT>   Total defense appropriations would be cut to an estimated$283.6 billion, or more than 6.3% below current levels.Though foreign aid would grow with inflation, the new limitsare significantly more severe than in the House. Directoutlays for foreign aid in fiscal 1991 would be held to $12.6billion, or $574 million below a House-passedforeign-operations bill, and the tighter budget gives theadministration little or no leeway to restore funds it wantsfor its military-aid program.   Among domestic programs, Mr. Byrd had less freedom thanhis House counterparts in allocating increases among themajor subcommittees that will begin drafting bills as earlyas today. Almost $800 million in new discretionary spendingwould be provided for labor, health, and education programs,for example. But senators still face difficult choices whenmatched against comparable House figures, which are $800million higher in fiscal 1991 outlays.   Subcommittees responsible for environmental, housing, andlaw-enforcement programs will face the same politicaldifficulty when compared with the House, and the tighterlimits again hurt the Bush administration as it seeks torestore funds for its troubled space program and its newinitiative to explore Mars.   The House cut practically all the money for the Marsproject from its bill covering the space program. Senatorswill begin drafting their own version from a starting point$630 million below the House for not only space butenvironmental, housing and veterans' programs in fiscal 1991.   Republicans were most conspicuous in complaining about thecuts, while the Democratic majority, out of respect for orfear of their chairman, said little. Sen. Byrd, in turn,quietly helped allies on both sides -- and himself. The threesubcommittees that fare best in comparison to the Houseinclude Sen. Byrd's own Interior panel, as well as thosecovering energy and water programs and the Treasury. On thelatter two subcommittees, the senior Republicans are OregonSen. Mark Hatfield, the ranking GOP member on Appropriations,and New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, an important ally on theSenate Budget Committee in shaping the plan.   While the cuts from defense are comparable to those in theHouse, the resolution builds in some modest leeway by making$500 million more available for weapons and personnelaccounts while cutting more deeply from military constructionfor foreign bases.</TEXT></DOC>
