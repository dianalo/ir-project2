Echoing the rhetoric of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace inpast presidential campaigns, Gephardt called Dukakis and Gore thefavorites of ``editorialists and elites'' with ``hardly a dime'sworth of difference'' between them on economic issues.   With the crucial Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses less thantwo weeks away, Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, leveled hischarges at Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, and Gore, a senatorfrom Tennessee, who are the two he must beat March 8 to become theDemocratic front-runner. Gephardt generally trails both in thepolls in the Super Tuesday states.   On foreign policy, Gephardt said Dukakis' experience ``consistsalmost entirely of negotiating with the governor of New Hampshireover the issue of nuclear power.''   On the economy, Gephardt said Gore ``has talked more about whatis wrong with the Iowa caucus than what is wrong with the nationaleconomy.''   He accused Gore of having ``no budget solution at all'' andDukakis of being off the mark by as much as $95 billion with hisclaim of the return on more aggressive pursuit of tax cheats.   ``On the central economic issues of this campaign, there ishardly a dime's worth of difference between Governor Dukakis andSenator Gore,'' Gephardt said in a speech. ``The Gore-Dukakisapproach is to distract the voters from those fundamental questions_ to divert the campaign to tactics or drown it in generalities.   ``The Gore-Dukakis approach is worse than an evasion. It invitesa post-election round of income tax increases and federal cuts inMedicare and Social Security _ which is the standard prescriptionof too many editorialists and elites,'' Gephardt said.   ``I am not their candidate. I have not been a favorite of theestablishment editorialists. Michael Dukakis is. I have not beenendorsed by the neo-liberals of The New Republic. They haveendorsed Albert Gore.''   On farm policy, trade and the idea of an oil import fee,Gephardt contended: ``Governor Dukakis talks competence; SenatorGore talks strength _ but there is nothing competent or strong(about their policies).''   Dukakis and Gore were on the road campaigning Wednesday and didnot have an immediate response to Gephardt's blast.   But Dukakis aide Leslie Dach said: ``We welcome a comparison ofthe candidates' records but first we need to know which of DickGephardt's records he's talking about.''   Dach said that ``Mike Dukakis is the only candidate in this racewho has balanced budgets, put people back to work and lowered taxesfive times in five years.''   Gore has ridiculed Dukakis and Gephardt as ``two peas in a pod.... I don't see either one of them to stand out as a principalchallenger.''   Gephardt has been hitting Dukakis with ads accusing him ofraising taxes in Massachusetts and of making ridiculous suggestionsto farmers that they should diversify with crops such asblueberries and Belgian endive.   Gephardt and Dukakis have split early Democratic tests, whileGore has focused on Super Tuesday when 20 states and American Samoahold primaries and caucuses _ many of them in the South.   Polls across the South generally put Gephardt third or fourth inthe field. Jesse Jackson has usually been the leader in theSouthern surveys, but a new Gallup Poll conducted last week gaveDukakis the lead.   Dukakis and Gore have big campaign warchests for March 8, whileGephardt's campaign has been on a slimmer budget.   In Austin, Texas, Gephardt, who won Tuesday's South Dakotaprimary, said he doesn't think Gore will have much impact on theMarch 8 elections.   ``Albert Gore has not run and won anything in any of these races(so far),'' Gephardt said. ``He pulled out of Iowa. He ran hard inNew Hampshire and got not many votes. He was very active in SouthDakota, probably spent more than I did and did not get many votes.I don't see this as a Gephardt-Gore race, I think it's aGephardt-Dukakis race.''</TEXT></DOC>
