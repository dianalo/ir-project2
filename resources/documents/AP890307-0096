(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Engineers Tuesday replaced a failedelectronic part on Discovery with one borrowed from sister shipColumbia, and NASA said it hopes to launch the space shuttle and itsfive astronauts on Monday.   ``We're still pressing ahead toward a Monday launch at 8:07a.m.,'' said space agency spokesman Dick Young. But he said a firmdate might not be set until Wednesday, after the replacement parthad been thoroughly checked out.   The launch, which will deploy a $100 million communicationssatellite, had been set for Saturday after three earlierpostponements. But it received another setback on Monday with thefailure of a system that commands separation of the two boosterrockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight.   Engineers replaced the unit with one from space shuttle Columbiaand began the testing of it on the launch pad Tuesday.   The unit detonates explosives in flight to separate such thingsas the spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets andfuel tank from the ship.   NASA has said if Discovery is not launched by March 18, it mighthave to yield the pad to space shuttle Atlantis, which is set forliftoff April 28 on a high-priority mission in which it will propelthe Magellan probe toward Venus.   Magellan must be launched between that date and May 23 becausethe planet will not be in proper position again until 1991.   Discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since theChallenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three yearsago.   During five days in orbit, the astronauts are scheduled to deploya communciations satelllite and conduct medical and scientificexperiments.</TEXT></DOC>
