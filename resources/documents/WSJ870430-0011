The House passage of the amendment sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), which its opponents say could help start a U.S.-Japanese trade war, came as Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone arrived in Washington. Mr. Nakasone is to hold talks with President Reagan aimed at easing trade tensions.    Soon after the House vote, the White House released a statement saying a further decline in the dollar's value could be &quot;counter-productive.&quot; Traders generally ignored the statement and continued to sell dollars, sending the U.S. currency to its lows for the day.    Trading was listless yesterday until the House vote. Then, &quot;it got wild and hectic,&quot; Jack A. Kessler, vice president, foreign exchange, at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said. Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo in New York, said, &quot;Everybody tried to sell dollars&quot; at once.    At around 4 p.m. in New York, the dollar stood at 138.50 Japanese yen, down 1.1% from 140.05 yen Tuesday. The dollar had been above its Tuesday levels for most of the session, reaching an intraday high of 141.10 yen in early New York trading amid optimism about the Nakasone visit.    The dollar also fell 0.6% to an intraday low of 1.7850 West German marks from 1.7950 marks a day earlier.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar stood at 138.70 yen.    Traders said they sold dollars after the Gephardt amendment passed because they fear a trade war with Japan that would be damaging to the U.S. The amendment would require countries that have built up large trade surpluses with the U.S. through so-called unfair trade practices to reduce those surpluses or face U.S. retaliation.    &quot;The Japanese will see this as a direct slap in the face to their leader,&quot; James M. Pugh, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    Traders said they expect some type of retaliation from Japan. Some speculated that Japanese investors might react by boycotting next week's Treasury auction of nearly $30 billion of U.S. government debt. That would further undercut support for the dollar.    President Reagan's warning about the dollar rate was seen as a White House effort to calm the currency market. &quot;We wouldn't have seen the Reagan statement&quot; if the Gephardt provision hadn't passed, Mr. Pugh said.    But the president's comment did little, except perhaps to slow the dollar's descent. &quot;We've heard the exact same wording from (Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul) Volcker and (Treasury Secretary James) Baker, so the market just ignored it and continued to sell,&quot; Daniel E. Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    &quot;It was easy to talk the dollar down because everyone thought it was overvalued,&quot; Mr. Holland said, &quot;but it's a lot harder to (bring it back up) with talk.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.20 an ounce in moderate trading estimated at three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $454.50 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Wednesday, April 29, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
