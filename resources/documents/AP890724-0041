Joseph Howleysaid of the weekend incident aboard an MD-80 jet with 146passengers aboard.   ``It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of runningaround the plane and making demands on the crew and being a generalnuisance and hollering,'' Howley said.   Officials available today were unable to say if blows wereexchanged on the flight Saturday, but said the husband struggledwith police who arrested him in the airport terminal.   Facing arraignment today on a variety of charges are StevenSacks-Wilner, 39, attorney for Republicans in the New JerseySenate, and his wife, Joane, 37. Also arrested were a Medford,Mass., family, Frank J. Federico, 50, his wife, Camella, 48, andtheir son John, 22, and John's girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte.   Sacks-Wilner is charged with interfering with a flight crew,being a disorderly person and three counts of assault on a policeofficer for allegedly resisting officers at the gate. The otherswere charged with interfering with a flight crew.   The Massachusetts State Police say the fracas aboard the flighttook place when the plane was in the air, and forced the pilot toabort the landing Saturday evening.   But airline spokesman Ned Walker insisted the fight took placeon the ground, and that the pilot aborted his first landing attemptbecause another plane was slow to taxi out of the way.   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigting, saidMichael Ciccarelli, a spokesman in Boston.
