(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gail Gentry, whose lower back was crushed whena mine roof caved in 11 years ago, pushed his wheelchair in frontof a caravan of massive coal trucks and held a sign saying,``Pittston Stole My Health Card.''   ``I'm taking a stand against an immoral company and against animmoral act,'' the 42-year-old miner said last week, just before hebecame the 2,000th person arrested in the United Mine Workers'strike against Pittston Coal Group.   Such non-violent tactics have won the union public sympathy, butlittle movement at the bargaining table. With the strike involvingnearly 1,700 miners entering its eighth week and federally mediatednegotiations set to resume Wednesday, officials of the union andthe company, Virginia's largest coal producer, say they areprepared for a lengthy battle.   ``This thing is a long way from being over,'' UMW strikecoordinator Marty Hudson said.   Morale, though, remains high among the striking miners who dressuniformly in camouflage and head every day to the coal fields,located in Virginia's southwestern tip.   Miners have brought their wives and children along and theatmosphere on the main picket line is festive at times.   During a recent demonstration, a few dozen picketers, with abanjo and mandolin setting the pace for flatfoot dancers, joined ina stanza criticizing the company's withdrawal of some healthbenefits from their modified tune of ``Oh, Susannah.''   The music stopped when a handful of burly miners and their wivessat down in the road to block a caravan of coal trucks fromentering Pittston's processing plant.   As state troopers arrested the demonstrators, the crowd sang``We Shall Overcome.''   On Wednesday, a dozen priests, nuns and church activists werearrested in sit-down demonstrations.   The miners went on strike April 5 after working 14 monthswithout a contract. They claim the company, which refused to goalong with an industrywide UMW agreement, is trying to break theunion by reducing job security and setting up an independentpension fund.   Pittston officials say they want to maintain a union shop, butunder its own rules to provide labor flexibility, such as increasedsubcontracting and seven-day work weeks, to meet growingcompetition from non-union and foreign companies.   Both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect futurecontract negotiations throughout the coal industry.   Negotiators from both sides are scheduled to meet withrepresentatives of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation ServiceWednesday after taking a break last week.   Union officials and industry analysts say there is little chancethe federal mediators will reach a settlement, in part because theyare not empowered to arbitrate a binding agreement.   ``If we're going to win this strike, we're going to win it righthere,'' Hudson said, gesturing to the crowd of several hundredpicketers.   Pittston President Michael Odom, referring to the industrywidecontract negotiated by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,said the union is ``dead set on cramming that BCOA agreement downour throats.   ``We're not going to take it. If the union's going to stick tothat position, we're going to be here a long time,'' Odom said fromhis office in Lebanon.   Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin fined the union$650,000 earlier this month for vandalism and for breaking hisrules against mass picketing and blocking coal trucks. He said theunion will face daily fines ranging from $20,000 to $100,000 if thetactics continue.   A federal judge is scheduled to decide Thursday whether to issuehis own restrictions on strike activities based on a complaintfiled by the National Labor Relations Board, which accused theunion of unfair labor practices.   Only one confrontation between strikers and drivers hired byPittston has resulted in injuries. Seven miners and two driverswere injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocks and thedrivers plowed into demonstrators.   Hudson said heavy fines will hurt the union, but will not stopthe civil disobedience.   ``The company and the judge say this is an economic struggle,but to me it's a moral fight that goes to the heart of the people,to preserving a way of life,'' he said. ``You make a decision thatyou're right and you don't back down.''</TEXT></DOC>
