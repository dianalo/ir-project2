Mr. Uqdah runs Cornrows andamp;Co., a salon that specializes in braiding the hair ofAfrican-American women. But the D.C. government is doing itsbest to force him to comply with burdensome and arbitrarycosmetology regulations that don't recognize hair-braiding asa legitimate profession.   Mr. Uqdah started Cornrows in 1980 on a grubstake of $500.Today, he has a $500,000-a-year hair-care business thateschews chemicals and uses a 4,000-year-old hair stylebrought to this country from Africa. The process isall-natural and weaves the hair into hundreds of tiny braids.</LP><TEXT>   The district government has tried to prosecute Mr. Uqdahon four separate occasions for operating his shop without alicense. Anyone who works with hair in the district mustfirst spend nine months in cosmetology school, at a cost ofmore than $3,000. But the schools teach none of Mr. Uqdah'smethods, and don't even mention hair-braiding. The JimCrow-era regulations were imposed in 1938. &quot;At that time,African-Americans couldn't even go into beauty salons, andthe regulations took none of our needs into account,&quot; Mr.Uqdah told us.   Starting in 1982, Mr. Uqdah has petitioned the D.C. Boardof Cosmetology to create a license for braiding, since itsnonchemical process can't be regarded as cosmetology. Whenthe board refused, Mr. Uqdah appealed to the City Council buthis bill was killed after lobbying by the board. Unable toobtain a hair-braiding license, he is frequently harassed bythe board and was recently hit with a $1,000 fine for&quot;operating an unlicensed beauty shop.&quot;   In a 1985 study the District of Columbia bar found thatcosmetology in the district is &quot;strongly overregulated&quot; andthat &quot;heavy licensing and regulations impose an improperbarrier to the practice of cosmetology, without offeringsignificant consumer protection.&quot;   This month, the Institute for Justice, headquartered inWashington, D.C., filed a lawsuit challenging theconstitutionality of these regulations. Clint Bolick, theinstitute's vice president, thinks it is high time the courtsprotected economic liberty as a fundamental civil right.&quot;Regulations like these cut off the bottom rungs of theeconomic ladder for people,&quot; says Mr. Bolick. &quot;It's time Mr.Uqdah and others have the right to earn their bread as bestthey can.&quot;   Government regulation often has very real and harmfuleffects on minorities, but traditional civil-rights groupsappear to have little interest in fighting to sweep awaypublic-sector impediments to black enterprise. For his part,Mr. Uqdah is disappointed that the civil-rights groupshaven't supported his nonviolent refusal to pay any fines.&quot;I'm part of the struggle too,&quot; he told Washington, D.C.'sCity Paper. &quot;Officials told Rosa Parks and all those peopledown in Montgomery: `It's the law.' They told us to sit inthe back of the bus. I'm not sitting in the back of the bus.I'm not buying into that old nonsense.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
