PAULSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The City Council has tentatively voted to giveground to both opponents and backers of Denver's ``living-in-sin''zoning ordinance.   The Council voted 8-5 Monday night to give tentative approval toamendments in zoning measures that were adopted in the 1960s todiscourage hippie communes by barring unrelated people from livingtogether in some parts of town.   Council members then postponed any further vote April 24.   The exact number of residents affected by the zoning rules wasnot immediately known. Denver has a population of 505,000.   As many as 53 percent of the residences in Denver are in an R-1zone, where a homeowner must obtain a $20 boarder's permit to covera non-relative. The amendments would drop the permit requirementbut would bar nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and in-laws frommoving in, said City Councilwoman Cathy Donohue.   Donohue, who voted for the amendments, counted that as a setbackto opponents of ``living-in-sin'' restrictions. ``Since 1956, youhave been allowed to have all these relatives in your home,'' shesaid.   A more restrictive code, called R-0 and applying to 7 percent ofDenver residences, bans boarders or unrelated people from living inthe same house. The amendments would allow two unrelated adults tolive together, but no more.   The penalty for violating the city's ordinance is $999 a day. Inpractice, Donohue said, people just move.   The city zoning office keeps no count of boarder permits issued,and the city attorney's office said it has no figures on people whohave challenged the law or paid the fine.   Among those affected are three nuns who are being forced to moveout of a four-bedroom home.   ``They wanted all but one of us to move out,'' said one of thenuns, who asked that her name not be used. ``To me, it's wastefulto have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms.It's very sinful.''   Five years ago, five people challenged R-0 zoning in stateSupreme Court and lost, said Jennifer Macy, administrativeassistant to the City Council.</TEXT></DOC>
