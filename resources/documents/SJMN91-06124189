Mr. Mom, a.k.a. Michael Keaton, joinsNew York's finest and, when his widower partner is gunned down, plays FlatfootKnows Best to the orphans. (Like, who's going to smart-mouth the guy when he'spacking a smoking service revolver?);    The film is called &quot;One Good Cop&quot;(opening today). It comes from the Disney fun factory, which specializes insuch high-concept fodder as &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'ONE GOOD COP,' ONE LOUSY MOVIE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Review(box) Keaton cops a plea, Page 6D  </MEMO><TEXT>     There's nothing wrong with &quot;Cop&quot; that one good story -- and a less schizoiddirector -- couldn't cure. As is, the thing lunges for the tear ducts oneminute, the central nervous system the next.;    In places, thisorphans-and-the-fuzz story plays like &quot;Oliver!&quot; as it might have beenre-tooled and modernized by &quot;Serpico&quot; film maker Sidney Lumet. Only these meanstreets are about as mean as Sesame Street between cookie break and curfew.;   Keaton poses other problems. The hugely likable star of &quot;Mr. Mom,&quot; &quot;Batman&quot;and &quot;Clean and Sober&quot; has long fancied himself serious leading-man material.Unfortunately, temperamentally he's not suited for heavy drama. Hisstock-in-trade is the nice-guy wise-guy, the quip-a-second clown from hell.Which made him the perfect choice for &quot;Beetlejuice.&quot;;    Here, for the sake ofa semi-gritty, semi-sweet story, Keaton tones down his smart-aleck routine.It's to no avail. He still comes off as the NYPD's version of a slick stand-upcomic. As for Keaton's doughy baby face, it's punched and mashed and bloodiedin every third scene. Again, to little effect. The ticks and double takesstill poke through in the year's most self-conscious attempt at underacting.;   Keaton plays Det. Artie Lewis, a cop who seems almost easy-going, relaxed.The most important people in Artie's life are his wife, Rita (Rene Russo of&quot;Mr. Destiny&quot;), and his partner, Stevie (Anthony LaPaglia). Stevie, stillreeling from the death of his wife, is the overextended father of threedaughters, ages 5 to 11. Rita craves a family of her own but is unable toconceive.;    If this were a segment of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents,&quot; Artiewould plot his partner's demise and make a present of the guy's kids to hiswife. Morbid? Perhaps. But it's more honest -- and a whole lot less contrived-- than what director-writer Heywood Gould has come up with.;    Stressed-outdads;  Gould, a former police reporter who scored with &quot;Cocktail&quot; and &quot;FortApache: The Bronx,&quot; has Stevie buy it during an intense hostage situationinvolving -- yeah, you guessed it -- a strung-out father and his abused wifeand kids. The standoff hits a little too close to home for Stevie, who chargesthe well-armed nut case.;    Voila! Instant orphans. Now it's left to Artieand Rita to adjust to their roles as foster parents. They do so with cottoncandy and trips to the carnival (little wonder the youngest, Blair Swanson, isa diabetic and the oldest, played by Grace Johnston of &quot;Beaches,&quot; seems morethan a little hyper).;    As for housekeeping bills and a more livable placein the suburbs, &quot;Uncle&quot; Artie covers these expenses by ripping off the samedrug dealer who supplied the &quot;ice&quot; (distilled speed) that indirectly led toStevie's death.;    Just a few questions . . .;  Artie's creative bookkeepingposes more questions than it answers. Like: If he loves his family, why placeit in harm's way? Like: Where the heck does his key informant come from? Oneminute she's spitting on him, and the next she's leading him to theheadquarters of the neighborhood's most feared drug lord (Tony Plana). Like:How will this guy ever extract himself from the lies and extra-legalmaneuverings?;    Gould stages one decent elevator fight but handles thesemounting questions with an appalling disregard for logic and viewerintelligence. One shoot-out and one meeting with the precinct lieutenantlater, and Artie the Teflon cop is back on track, dreaming of an idyllicfamily existence bankrolled with dirty money.;    Keaton may give the boys inInternal Affairs the slip, but his movie won't get off as easily. We'repredicting that word-of-mouth -- the filmgoer's answer to a citizen's arrest-- will take this movie off the street overnight.;  One Good Cop; (star);Rated: R (for profanity, violence); Cast: Michael Keaton, Rene Russo, KevinConway; Director-writer: Heywood Gould  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN LOVELL, Mercury News Film Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910503  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  755  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 3, 199100124189,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
