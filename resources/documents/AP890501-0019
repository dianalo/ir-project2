COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The case of a father accused of killing hiscomatose son by disconnecting him from a respirator is going tocourt, and two past cases fared very differently in the nation'scourtrooms.   Rudy Linares, a 23-year-old house painter from west suburbanCicero, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of hisseverely brain-damaged son, Samuel, at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke'sMedical Center.   Police say Linares kept nurses in the pediatric intensive-careunit at bay with a handgun while he disconnected the 16-month-oldboy's respirator Wednesday and cradled him until he was sure thebaby was dead.   ``I think he was definitely in a state of irreversiblevegetative coma,'' said the boy's physician, Dr. Gilbert Goldman,director of the pediatric intensive care unit. ``My opinion wasthat recovery was not possible.''   Yet the hospital refused the family's request that therespirator be turned off, contending that Illinois law prohibitswithdrawing life-support unless the patient is already legally dead.   Three years ago, a 25-year-old Miami father was sentenced tolife in prison for killing his comatose 3-year-old daughter, whomhe shot with a pistol as she lay in her hospital crib, eight monthsafter she had been injured in an accident.   An Illinois case that began six years ago has a vastly differenthistory.   In that case, charges against a Beecher veterinarian whoadmitted crushing the head of his severely deformed newborn sonwere dismissed by a judge after two juries failed to reach averdict.   In both instances, the legal battles are dragging on.   Charles Leroy Griffith of Miami is appealing his sentence, whichcarries a mandatory 25-year term, in the hope of obtaining a newtrial in the shooting of his daughter, Joy.   He never denied the act. The girl had been in a coma for eightmonths after her head got caught between the foot rest and the seatof a recliner chair, cutting off her air supply.   ``I couldn't stop her from suffering,'' Griffith told the judge,explaining his motive for ending his daughter's life. ``There wasnothing I could do. It drove me crazy ... at least she's notsuffering any more.''   In Illinois, Cook County prosecutors are hoping to get a murdercharge reinstated against Daniel McKay, who pleaded temporaryinsanity after slamming his newborn son to the floor of thedelivery room at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey.   Circuit Judge Will E. Gierach dropped the charges after twojuries failed to reach a verdict.</TEXT></DOC>
