Retired Maj. Mark Adkin says the U.S. military action was notnecessary to save the lives of American medical students on theCaribbean island, as claimed by the Reagan administration, and infact endangered them.   He also says U.S. soldiers succeeded despite weak advanceplanning and haphazard coordination by leaders of the differentmilitary services involved.   Adkin, who took part in the invasion as Caribbean operationsstaff officer for the Barbados Defense Force, recounts the missionin a new book titled ``Urgent Fury: The Battle for Grenada.''   He lauds the outcome of the invasion, which occurred six yearsago this week, and says it prevented Grenada from becoming a``communist bastion'' in the region. But he dismisses U.S. claimsat the time that the 700 American medical students on the islandwere in danger of being taken hostage.   Then-President Reagan repeatedly said the 6,000 combat troopsstaged a ``rescue mission'' on Oct. 25, 1983, to prevent thestudents from being taken hostage by a radical Marxist government.   If anything, Adkin says, the invasion increased the chances thatthe students would be taken hostage.   ``U.S. citizens were in no danger until the operation waslaunched,'' he writes. ``The assault on the island could easilyhave precipitated the taking of hostages by desperate men driven todesperate means to save their own lives.''   The administration decided to intervene in Grenada ``on thebasis of seizing a fleeting strategic-political advantage, whichhad the added merit that inevitable military success would raiseU.S. flagging morale,'' he says.   The predawn attack by combined elite units of all the U.S. armedforces came days after leftists on the island executed MarxistPrime Minister Maurice Bishop and imposed a 24-hour curfew. Theinvasion forces ousted the leftists and flew the students home.   A former Reagan administration official, Langhorne AnthonyMotley, disputes Adkin's claims about the students, saying: ``He'stotally incorrect.''   Motley, a former assistant secretary of state for inter-Americanaffairs, said a CIA officer spoke with the students before thetroops arrived and ``they were concerned'' about being takenhostage.   Regardless of the reason for the mission, Adkin says, the U.S.troops deserved the heroes' welcome they received from both theislanders and the American public upon their return.   ``The people who had been invaded welcomed the invaders,regarded them as liberators, even going so far as to want U.S.troops to remain far longer than they did. The island was to be acommunist bastion, an ever more menacing reminder to the rest ofthe region that their way of live was threatened,'' he says.   ``This is what it would have become. That it did not was becausePresident Reagan acted, albeit primarily for reasons of nationalself-interest.''   Nineteen American soldiers died in the initial assault andseveral days of skirmishes. Adkin says two Army Rangers also diedwhen their parachutes failed to open.   He argues that the American soldiers had to overcome a lack ofintelligence information on the island and poor preparation for thejoint operation.   The U.S. military has done its own assessments on Grenada,finding fault with the lack of coordination and intelligence. Manydetails of those assessments remain classified, however.   A retired U.S. military officer, who served in the planning andexecution of the Grenada invasion, acknowledged some problems butsaid Adkin ``doesn't tell the whole story.''   The officer, who spoke only on condition he not be furtheridentified, agreed that the troops operated without maps andup-to-date intelligence information but said Adkin should havenoted that ``a lot of decisions were made on the ground by groundcommanders. They were able to adapt.''   However, he agreed that the various armed forces wereill-prepared to work together and said the decision to use acombined force at that time was wrong.   The Grenada operation later was cited by Sen. William Cohen,D-Maine, as the main reason for a 1986 bill mandating a jointspecial operations command.   ``That it succeeded as it did, without costly setbacks, was dueprimarily to incredibly good fortune,'' Adkin says.   Still, he concludes that ``for all the errors, for all theconfusion, for all the suffering, Grenada and its people remaingrateful to those bold enough to launch the operation and thosebold enough to undertake it.''</TEXT></DOC>
