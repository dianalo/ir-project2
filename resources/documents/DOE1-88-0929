Hole size, percent open area, and thickness parameterswere varied among the plates. Experimental results were compared to analyticalprojections and differed significantly. The single-blow transient testtechnique was used to determine the heat transfer coefficients and theisothermal pressure drop test was used to determine the friction factoras a function of Reynolds number.</TEXT></DOC>
