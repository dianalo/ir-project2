There are strong pressures against a cut now, including economicarguments that it might not be the best way to speed the economy's recovery.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUSH, CONGRESS TALK TAX CUT AT 11TH HOURWEAK ECONOMY IGNORED BY LEADERS FOR MONTHS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But there is no doubt that Washington has gone through one of thosepeculiar moments in which all parties seem to have been stampeded at leastinto the appearance of action by a sudden political epiphany.;   In this case,it seemed, both Congress and the White House came to the realization thatlawmakers were about to go home for two months without addressing the oneissue foremost in voters' minds -- the sagging economy -- and that it wouldget increasingly hard for them to keep blaming each other for the lapse.;  Over a chaotic 24 hours, a last-minute economic proposal that a group of HouseRepublicans floated as a short-term tactical measure suddenly galvanized thecapital, even though it was not supported even by a majority of their ownparty.;   After initially chastising the sponsors, President Bush reversedhimself and endorsed their plan, only to find himself assailed forflip-flopping in a way that GOP strategists found uncomfortably like hisvacillation over taxes in the 1990 budget debate.;   The Democrats, for theirpart, gleefully scheduled hearings next month on the Republican plan by theWays and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.;   The Democratsare expected to bring up their own proposals for tax cuts, while attacking theRepublicans over tax cuts that Democrats say favor the wealthiest Americans.;  The Democrats also left open the possibility of returning to a session inDecember, rather than sitting at home and waiting for the broadside from theWhite House that Bush had warned would be forthcoming in the winter recess.;  The result will inevitably be a lot of punchy political lines, but perhaps notmuch sound economic policy.;   &quot;They're all searching for the tax cut thatraises revenue -- the politician's Holy Grail,&quot; said Herbert Stein, aneconomist with the American Enterprise Institute.;   It all began whenRepublicans in the House, led by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, threw together alast-minute economic growth package, including a cut in the tax rate onprofits from investments, to show they were concerned about the economy evenif the White House did not appear to be.;   The Republicans dared theirDemocratic opponents to bring it to the floor before the Thanksgiving recess,knowing it had no prayer of passage but counting on attacking the Democratslater if they failed to take action.;   Bush's eventual endorsement turnedaround the Democrats on Capitol Hill, focusing the normally confused closingdays of a congressional session on a single issue, emboldening their attack onthe White House over the economy and leaving the White House open for anotherfight over the capital gains tax cut.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  531  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, November 28, 199100333188,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
