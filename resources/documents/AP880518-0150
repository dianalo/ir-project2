Hanaway said.   The dispute over Chippewa hunting and fishing rights in NorthernWisconsin was the focus of a hearing by the House Judiciarycommittee on civil rights. Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., is chairman,and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner is the rankingRepublican.   Sensenbrenner said he was advised by Interior Secretary DonaldHodel that no current federal money was avaiable for a financialsettlement between the state and the Chippewa.   Hanaway said that ``there is a clear potential for violence inthe future'' as a result of court rulings granting substantialoff-reservation hunting and fishing rights based on treaties of1837 and 1842. There are six Chippewa bands with reservations inWisconsin.   The attorney general said ``a very small and vocal minority'' inNorthern Wisconsin ``persists in engaging in racist anti-Indianactivity, under the guise of treaty rights issues.''   Hanaway and other witnesses said there was near-violence duringthe last several Indian spearfishing seasons, prevented only by astrong law enforcement presence.   The attorney general said legislation is needed to allow federallaw enforcement officials to effectively assist state and localauthorities.   ``Additionally, I would urge this committee to support federalappropriations to assist states in providing necessasry lawenforcement service,'' he added.   James H. Schlender, executive administrator of the Great LakesIndian Fish and Wildlife Commission, called for federal legislationmaking it a crime to interfere with the exercise of federal treatyprotected rights.   ``Existing laws, both federal and state, leave ambiguity as tothe duties of federal and state law enforcement officials,'' hesaid. ``This ambiguity must be cleared up. Treaty rights must beprotected.''   Referring to the relative calm of the spring spearfishingseason, Schlender said, ``a temporary lid appears to have beenplaced upon the boiling pot of hatred in Wisconsin'' againstIndians.   The commission is an intertribal organization of 11 LakeSuperior Chippewa Tribes from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.   In a report to the committee, the tribal attorney for the Lac duFlambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewas said Northern Wisconsinhas experienced ``an outpouring of racist backlash which has gonewell beyond mere opposition to treaty rights.''   Attorney James M. Jannetta said, ``Its intensity and virulencehas shocked the Chippewa people.   ``So far the incidents of violence have been minor, but as theracist reaction builds, people of goodwill on both sides wonder howlong this can remain the case.''   Jannetta said that in the spring 1988 spearfishing season, theLac du Flambeau ``faced massive harassment throughout the season,and it was only an equally massive law enforcement effort thatprotected the physical safety of the spearers.''</TEXT></DOC>
