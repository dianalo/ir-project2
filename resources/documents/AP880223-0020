ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior official of the Bahamas is angered bya State Department charge that ``systemic corruption'' in hisgovernment is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drugtrafficking there.   Paul L. Adderley, attorney general of the Bahamas, also disputedrecent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paidPrime Minister Lynden Pindling millions of dollars to protectoperations in the Caribbean country.   ``What offends us the most is the judgment that if it were notfor corruption and indifference in this country, the Bahamas wouldnot and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling ofColombia cocaine and marijuana to South Florida,'' Adderley told aSenate hearing Monday.   ``If the corruption and indifference that is perceived were tomagically disappear, the rate of smuggling might not diminish atall simply because I regret to say the United States has not putthe personnel, equipment and operating funds into doing what needsto be done in the Bahamas,'' he said.   He said it was ``untrue, unfair and distorts the real facts'' tosuggest that the Bahamas is not doing enough to halt the flow of 60percent of the cocaine and marijuana that enters the United Statesthrough his country.   But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he still might vote todeny further U.S. assistance to the Bahamas when the Senate dealswith the question of drug interdiction efforts by foreign countriesin the next few weeks.   ``We already have too much rhetoric and empty promises,''D'Amato said.   Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for internationalnarcotics matters, combined criticism with praise for the Bahamas'impressive narcotics seizures and cooperation with U.S. authorities.   She said the joint interdiction of 24,860 pounds of cocaine and146.5 tons of marijuana in the Bahamas last year was ``not equaledin any other country in the Caribbean.''   Nonetheless, she said: ``Narcotics-related corruption remains aserious problem in the Bahamas. The Bahamian government has notdealt effectively with systemic corruption, which continues to makethe Bahamas attractive to drug traffickers.''   D'Amato and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., questioned Adderleyclosely about American marijuana smuggler George Baron's testimonylast week at the drug trial of Colombian cocaine kingpin CarlosLehder in Jacksonville, Fla.   Baron said he paid Pindling $3 million to $5 million from 1979to 1981 in exchange for Bahamian protection for his activities.Baron also quoted Lehder as saying he himself had paid Pindling$200,000 a month in bribes.   Baron said he once paid Pindling $400,000 at a gambling casinoon Paradise Island in the Bahamas in the fall of 1980, whichAdderley said was ``a totally incredible story, an unbelievablestory.''   Adderley said he intended to investigate Baron's allegations.But he also said that for Pindling to accept a bribe in a crowdedcasino ``would be like the president of the United States taking abribe in Atlantic City.''</TEXT></DOC>
