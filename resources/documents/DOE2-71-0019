The patientswere examined by MR both before TCE and after TCE(1 week and 4 - 5 weeksrespectively). The change of the tumor signal intensity was divided into2 types on a T2 weighted image. One, is the increase of the intensity.The other, is decrease of intensity. The former seemed to reflect theintra-tumoral hemorrhage accompanying tumor necrosis, the latter, seemedto reflect the coagulation necrosis. The ring of low and high intensityaround the tumor appeared anew in 11 cases, and in 2 cases, it increasedin size. These changes which have never been recognized on CT images,were thought to be a granulation tissue around the tumor.</TEXT></DOC>
