LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's defense industry is struggling _no surprise there _ but some of the reasons have little to do withthe thaw in the Cold War and cutbacks at the Pentagon.   The bad news this past week from some of the nation's largestdefense contractors can be traced back to things that have beengoing on a lot longer than the dismantling of the Berlin Wall,stock analysts said.   McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced a drastic cost-cuttingcampaign that will lay off thousands. General Dynamics Corp.announced a heavy second-quarter loss. And Grumman Corp.'s headresigned abruptly amid reports he was under investigation forpossibly accepting improper loans from a subcontractor.   The austerity measures taken by McDonnell Douglas, the nation'sbiggest defense company, are aimed at saving more than $700 millionthis year.   But that plan, which some analysts said doesn't go far enough,is primarily a result of management mistakes that have left the St.Louis-based company inefficient and unprofitable.   ``This is something they have to do to keep their head abovewater,'' said Michael Rosen, an aerospace analyst at Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. ``The company has its back to thewall.''   McDonnell Douglas has been plagued by production troubles at itsDouglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, Calif., where most ofits commercial jet construction is done. The company also has beenhurt by losses on a range of military projects.   Its production backlog has climbed to a record $54 billion.While it's nice to know there are plenty of customers, McDonnellChairman John F. McDonnell said he wants to ensure the company ismaking, not losing, money on its orders.   ``At this point in time, we have more costs than we can have tobe successful in our business,'' McDonnell said. ``We made somemistakes and we're in the process of correcting them.''   Meanwhile, the nation's second biggest contractor, GeneralDynamics Corp., also headquartered in St. Louis, announced a $240million loss in the second quarter because of cost overruns on theNavy's A-12 jet bomber.   The company said deducting $500 million from quarterly earnings_ the biggest quarterly charge against earnings in its history _primarily because the development of A-12 would cost more thanexpected.   Industry analysts said this trouble was caused by what theycalled the dumb but popular idea in Congress that advanced militaryequipment should be developed on a pre-determined budget.   ``It's like saying, `I'm going to do something adventurouswithout the adventure.' If you think you can pioneer something on afixed budget, you're basically lying to yourself,'' said WolfgangDemisch, an analyst for UBS Securities in New York.   Fixed-price development contracts set a price for thedevelopment of a new piece of equipment. If a contractor goes overthe price, the contractor has to file claims and ask for theadditional money.   Generally, defense contractors haven't listed cost overruns onthe development of planes, tanks or other equipment until after theproject is completed and those various contract claims have beensettled.   ``But what's happening here is the government is leaning veryheavily on the contractors to take the charge and not say anythingabout the contract claims,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   ``The company is playing politics. They're looking to keep thecustomer happy even though they are paying dearly in the balancesheet.''   General Dynamics' partner on the A-12 program is McDonnellDouglas, which didn't take any charges for the project and reporteda profit of $57 million for the quarter. But analysts saidMcDonnell Douglas it is assuming the Pentagon will cough up theextra cost.   For Grumman, an important Pentagon supplier based in Bethpage,Long Island, the trouble this past week stemmed from a broadinvestigation by the Justice Department into defense-contractingcorruption.   John O'Brien, who resigned suddenly as head of the company, wasreported to be under grand jury investigation for possiblyaccepting nearly a half million dollars in loans from James Kane, anow-deceased Grumman subcontractor who was thought to be a centralfigure in a Pentagon bribery scheme. By week's end, neitherGrumman, O'Brien or his lawyer had commented on the reports.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _More troublesome economic signs emerged. Housing starts in Juneplunged to the worst level since the last recession, consumerprices jumped and a number of leading companies reporteddisappointing second-quarter earnings.   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested he won't moveto ease interest rates further unless Congress and the White Housemove decisively toward a deficit reduction. But in one key signthat interest rates are coming down, interest on fixed-ratemortgages fell below 10 percent for the first time since thebeginning of the year.   _The United Auto Workers union opened contract negotiations withthe Big Three automakers amid one of the deepest slumps theindustry has faced in years. Health care and job security are themajor issues in the talks.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions July 21-22</NOTE></DOC>
