(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. industry waslaunched into the space exploration business with the blastoff ofthe first licensed commercial spacecraft, officials said.   The successful, 15-minute suborbital voyage Wednesday of theConsort 1 should convince potential investors and customers thatprivate businesses can send a payload into space safely andreliably, said Carol Lane, director of the Department ofTransportation office that issued the pioneer launch license.   ``I think we'll see growth,'' she said minutes after the slenderrocket shot its payload of scientific experiments 178 miles high.``The commercial space industry has been slow to develop, and thisis one of the most positive developments we've seen in a longtime.''   The 630-pound payload capsule went through about seven minutesof near weightlessness, then parachuted gently onto the desertfloor of White Sands Missile Range about 58 miles north of thelaunch pad.   A preliminary look at the payload contents showed the flight wassuccessful, said David Dooling, spokesman for the University ofAlabama-Huntsville, which sponsored the project.   ``As far as we can tell, the scientific instruments worked well,but we don't have any results yet,'' he said. ``We think this is anoutstanding beginning, not only for space exploration but for spaceexperimentation.''   The payload included experiments designed to measure how liquidsmix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, howliquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness andhow finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to producealloys.   About 100 spectators cheered as the rocket streaked from itslaunch pad, spewing yellow flame and leaving a white trail.   The rocket dropped its first stage six seconds and more than amile into the voyage, and disappeared from sight in about 25seconds.   Most of the observers were employees or family members ofemployees of Space Services Inc., the Houston-based company thatprovided the rocket and launch services for the Consort 1.   Space Services launched the Conestoga 1 rocket in September1982, the first space shot by a private company. That rocketcarried a dummy payload, and the launch was carried out before theTransportation Department had formulated guidelines for licensingprivate spacecraft.   The Consort 1 was the first to be licensed and carry a realpayload.   To launch Conestoga 1, Space Services had to deal with 18government agencies. The Reagan administration directed theTransportation Department to issue launch licenses and cut throughgovernment red tape on private industry's behalf.   ``When we went up in '82, there was no infrastructure forcommercial launches,'' said Bill Vance, Space Services' vicepresident of finance and administration. ``We've been working along time to put up a successful launch. It's been a six-yearcountdown. We've been on long hold.''   The Consort 1 was a suborbital voyage, meaning it went intospace and back down again without circling the earth. But SpaceServices plans a much more ambitious project to put a satelliteinto orbit, possibly late next year, company spokesman Mark Danielssaid.   The cost of the Consort 1 has been pegged at $1 million to $2million. Daniels said he expects Space Services' annual revenues toreach $100 million to $500 million once it starts sendingsatellites into orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
