Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MHP </CO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McGraw-Hill Inc. sold its 49% interest in a Japanese joint publishing venture for $283 million and said it would write down the value of certain assets and take other charges totaling $110 million after taxes in the second quarter.    The net effect of the actions will be a one-time gain in the second quarter, a company spokeswoman said. In the year-ago second quarter, McGraw-Hill's net income totaled $40 million, or 79 cents a share, on revenue of $425.8 million.    The company said it expects that the combined actions will have &quot;a modestly favorable impact on 1988 earnings.&quot; McGraw-Hill expects the impact of the moves to be even greater next year and beyond.    Peter Appert, an analyst with C.L. Lawrence, said McGraw-Hill was making a calculated step to boost its stock price. The long-term goal behind the move is to remove a possible takeover threat, he said.    McGraw-Hill said it will post a $112 million gain from the sale of its stake. It said the buyer was Nihon Kezai Shimbun, which already owns 51% of the joint venture. The venture publishes Japanese magazines, newsletters and other information services.    Joseph L. Dionne, McGraw-Hill's chairman and chief executive officer, said the venture no longer fits the company's long-term goals because it develops products only for the Japanese market. The executive said the company's global strategy is to produce products and services that can be sold world-wide.    The company said the proceeds would be used to reduce substantially its short-term debt, which the spokeswoman said totals $150 million. She added that all of the company's short-term borrowing will be repaid within a month.    The write-downs include good will, other intangibles and certain other assets related to McGraw-Hill's Monchik-Weber and Data Resources units, its book company's training division, television film rights, book prepublication costs and other unusual charges. The spokeswoman said the unspecified charges were immaterial.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, McGraw-Hill stock closed at $52.125, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
