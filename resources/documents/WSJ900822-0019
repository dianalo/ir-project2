But even as the crisis edged closer to armedconfrontation, U.S. military commanders in Washington and theMideast expressed reservations about the current level ofU.S. forces -- more than 30,000 troops -- in the region. Todeter a ground attack and launch any kind of major offensiveaction, these officials suggested that they need to at leastdouble, and perhaps quadruple, American troop strength in theGulf.</LP><TEXT>   Amid the mounting tensions, the State Department confirmedthat at least 54 Americans now are believed to be in Iraqicustody. And bolstering the U.S. effort to choke Iraqeconomically, nine West European countries authorized theirgrowing fleet of warships in the Persian Gulf to use force toback United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq following itsAug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   At Mr. Bush's vacation house in Kennebunkport, Maine,White House Chief of Staff John Sununu described the plannedreserve call-up as &quot;surgical and specialized.&quot; Otherofficials said the call-up might be slightly larger than Mr.Sununu's description suggested, but would be well belowearlier, speculative estimates of 250,000 soldiers. Mr. Bush,who is scheduled to meet today in Kennebunkport with his topnational security advisers, is expected to initially leavethe number of reservists ambiguous.   As the U.S. continues to gear up in its confrontation withSaddam Hussein, there were some indications that the Iraqileader may be beginning to feel the squeeze. Yesterday, in an&quot;open letter to President Bush,&quot; he combined his customaryanti-American rhetoric with some surprisingly candidadmissions of vulnerability.   &quot;You must also realize that scientific and technologicalprogress, development and prosperity could not be achieved asArabs hope without dealing with the West,&quot; the Iraqi leadersaid, according to a translation of his text provided byReuters. &quot;For this to be realized,&quot; he added, &quot;they {Arabs}have to sell oil and the oil market is basically in Europe,America and Japan.&quot;   Iraq also reiterated its call for talks with the U.S. toresolve the crisis.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissedBaghdad's request for negotiations. The U.S. is talkingregularly with Iraq about American citizens being held inKuwait and Iraq, but Mr. Fitzwater suggested that Westernnations aren't interested in any broader negotiations untilBaghdad agrees to withdraw from Kuwait.   &quot;The U.N. has been very clear in demanding a complete andunconditional withdrawal from Kuwait,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said. Headded that all the nations involved in the multinationalaction against Iraq &quot;are willing to talk with Iraq, but onlywithin the context of compliance with the U.N. resolutions.&quot;   Separately, the U.S. allowed an Iraqi oil tanker to go toport in Yemen. The tanker was one of two at which U.S.warships fired warning shots over the weekend. Mr. Fitzwatersaid the U.S. allowed the tanker to dock on the basis of anassurance from Yemen that it &quot;would neither unload nor useany Iraqi oil.&quot; But, he added: &quot;We intend to follow up tomake sure that they comply with the sanctions.&quot;   Senior U.S. military officials claimed that Navyinterdiction efforts have forced many Iraqi vessels to slowdown, stay away from ports or sail empty to avoid aconfrontation. The number of ships calling at the port ofAqaba, Jordan, has dropped 90%, these officials said, andother ports in the region also show a significant decline inshipping activity. These officials added that some Iraqiships have steered zigzag courses and changed speeds,apparently to make it difficult to guess their destinationsand thereby avoid direct confrontation.   As the U.S. military buildup continues, officials won'tdiscuss contingency plans. But diversion and surprise arelikely to be important components of any military move.   The sheer number of Marines and the equipment they'rebringing with them suggests that one of the options thePentagon may be weighing is some sort of quick amphibious orairborne assault against Kuwait. The Seventh MarineExpeditionary brigade just arrived in northwestern SaudiArabia, equipped with heavy artillery and Cobra attackhelicopters. Such units are intended primarily for offensivemissions.   Some of Iraq's best troops are massed within 40 miles ofthe Saudi border, and cutting them off would deal a blow toBaghdad. Threats of U.S. amphibious assaults, combined withair attacks launched from carriers steaming in the Red Seaand Persian Gulf, could force Saddam Hussein to spread outhis crack troops.   Pentagon officials say the least favorable military optionwould be a drawn-out land battle with Iraq's best troops,which are battle-hardened from nearly 10 years of fighting inthe Iran-Iraq war. But even in that sort of confrontation,U.S. officials believe American ground troops initially wouldhave the edge because of their greater mobility and theirability to fight at night.   The Gulf effort, the largest U.S. military buildup sincethe Vietnam War, is likely to bring more than 100,000American troops to Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon says it couldtake months to build up a force that large. But already, theU.S. says, the air and naval power assembled in the regionwould prevent the Iraqis from overwhelming U.S. troops with adirect frontal assault.   Other military strategists say even though the U.S.doesn't face the threat of retaliation from the Soviet Unionin this crisis, it would make almost no sense for Washingtonto contemplate using nuclear weapons to dislodge the Iraqis.   Albert Wohlstetter, a nuclear strategist, said that thepolitical cost would be enormous and the military advantagewould be slight. He argued that likely targets for a U.S.attack on Iraq, such as pumping stations and refineries,could be destroyed about as well with conventional as nuclearweapons.   He said nuclear weapons might be used if U.S. forces wereabout to be overwhelmed in a tank battle in the desert. Buteven in such a scenario, he argued, there may be alternativesto using nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein continued to wield the weapon ofhostage-taking. The State Department said yesterday thatanother American and eight more British citizens were roundedup from their lodgings in Kuwait by the Iraqi military.   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said that&quot;we don't know for sure&quot; where 41 of the 54 Americans inIraqi custody are being held. He added that the U.S. has&quot;credible reports&quot; that some Westerners have been moved towhat he called &quot;Iraqi industrial installations.&quot; And an Arabdiplomatic source in Washington said there were reports thatabout 30 Westerners were placed at military installations inKuwait several days ago, but a State Department spokesmansaid he hadn't heard that.   Saddam Hussein vowed last week to use Westerners as&quot;shields&quot; at military and research facilities that might belikely targets for American bombs.   Mr. Boucher also said that 18 U.S. Embassy personnel inBaghdad left Iraq and entered Jordan yesterday, leaving abouta dozen U.S. diplomats in Iraq. He said the remainingpersonnel would be sufficient to keep the embassy functioningand &quot;carry out its primary mission -- that is, to see to thesafety and welfare of American citizens in Iraq and Kuwait.&quot;   U.S. officials also said they were making contingencyplans to reduce the number of American diplomats based inKuwait City. The officials said no final decision has beenmade on whether to reduce the number of diplomats there.Saddam Hussein has ordered all Western embassies closed byFriday and threatened to treat diplomats the same way ittreats all other Westerners if they remain after that.   The nine West European nations meeting yesterday in Parisechoed President Bush's warning that there would be &quot;graveconsequences&quot; if Western hostages were harmed. The Europeansalso gave full backing to an eventual U.N.-sponsored militaryblockade of Iraq.   ---   Gerald F. Seib in Kennebunkport, Maine, and Mark M.
