Mr. Herrington, as part of his overall effort to help the beleaguered U.S. petroleum industry, this week asked the cabinet and President Reagan to approve a 27.5% annual depletion allowance for all domestic oil and gas wells, administration officials said.    The letter proposing the tax breaks, which could cost the Treasury $2 billion to $7 billion annually, was sent to the president earlier this week, but hasn't been released. The Washington Post reported the proposal in yesterday's editions.    Appearing before a House Energy subcommittee yesterday, Mr. Herrington acknowledged that the proposal, along with other policy options detailed in a comprehensive report the Energy Department released Tuesday, may be blocked by the White House or the Treasury Department. The general concept of opening up last year's tax-overhaul law for amendments, Mr. Herrington said, hasn't been favored by the administration in the past &quot;and may still not be favored by the administration.&quot;    Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said yesterday that President Reagan hadn't yet formed an opinion on Mr. Herrington's depletion-allowance proposal. &quot;I think (Mr. Reagan) does have a fundamental objection&quot; to putting back breaks into the overhauled tax code for the oil and gas industry, Mr. Fitzwater said. &quot;However, we do have these recommendations, and they will be honestly considered and judged.&quot;    Some industry analysts have estimated that the depletion-allowance proposal could cost the Treasury as much as $7 billion annually, while Energy officials estimated the potential revenue loss at between $2 billion and $3.5 billion annually.    The oil-depletion allowance permitted companies to deduct 27.5% of the value of oil produced from wells until 1975. Major oil companies lost the tax break in that year, and independent producers have seen it whittled to 15% since then. </TEXT></DOC>
