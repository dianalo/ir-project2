It was, proclaimed Sen. Daniel Moynihan, &quot;the first true bill addressing the totality of drug abuse in the history of this body.&quot;    But the lawmakers actually spent only about $500 million of the money authorized under the legislation this fiscal year. And so far, hardly any of the promised additional $2.3 billion has been forthcoming. &quot;We lost our bill,&quot; concedes Sen. Moynihan, a New York Democrat.    As the legislation shows, the much-heralded war on drugs often is more rhetoric than reality. The federal government has shoveled out more than $21 billion for antidrug efforts over the past eight years, but the money has been disgorged in scattershot fashion, through tortuous layers of government and with scant evaluation of what works and what doesn't. The result isn't so much a war as a free-for-all.    A Maryland program provides a small but revealing example. Gina DeLeonardis, the director of a Baltimore County treatment center, recently used a $25,000 federal grant together with state money to set up a drug-counseling program for inmates at the county jail.    However, the effort was delayed for 18 months while funding was passed from Washington to the state to the county. Receiving no guidance, Ms. DeLeonardis bought an $11,000 classroom-trailer in which to counsel the prisoners. The program is finally under way, but the trailer sits, rarely used, on a macadam lot next to the 19th-century jail. The reason: Jail authorities haven't decided how to make it secure.    &quot;We need every dollar we can get, but who's in charge?&quot; asks an exasperated Ms. DeLeonardis.    The answer is everybody and nobody. Everybody wants to fight drugs, but some of the fiercest battles are fought over how to mount the attack. And the battle is about to heat up.    William Bennett, the Bush administration's outspoken drug czar, is promising to shake up federal programs by proposing a new &quot;national strategy&quot; by Sept. 5. He says he will lean heavily toward tougher local law enforcement. This would put him on a collision course with many in Congress who want to switch the emphasis to prevention, treatment and research.    Whatever the strategy, a major problem is that few federal drug dollars &quot;hit the target,&quot; Sen. David Pryor complains. Too much of the money, the Arkansas Democrat charges, goes into questionable projects: Encouraged by some success with using dogs to sniff out narcotics in luggage, the Customs Service recently awarded a $90,000 contract for research on an &quot;electronic nose,&quot; for example.    The top priority of the Reagan administration's war on drugs was to break up major narcotics rings within the U.S. and stop drugs at the border. Since 1981, such efforts have consumed 80% of the $21 billion spent by the federal government on fighting drugs, and there have been some gains. The Coast Guard and Customs Service seized 27.2 metric tons of cocaine in fiscal 1986, up from 1.7 tons in 1981.    But the huge effort hardly put a dent in the drug traffic. Latin American exporters simply increased production. The amount of coke flowing into the U.S. increased to 153 metric tons in 1985 from 68 metric tons in 1981, according to the latest government estimates. With more drugs on the street, cocaine prices have plunged 60% in some big cities, law-enforcement officials say.    Rand Corp., in a study conducted for the Pentagon, concluded that the only impact of the $5.72 billion spent on Coast Guard cutters, Customs Service jets and radar-equipped blimps was to trim supplies enough to raise prices of illegal drugs about 4% above the level they otherwise would have been. Increasing that percentage to 6% could cost an additional $1 billion a year, estimates Peter Reuter, the senior author of the study. &quot;It's very hard to see that putting more into interdiction will do much to cut the flow of drugs,&quot; he contends.    Even Attorney General Dick Thornburgh concedes: &quot;If you want to lose the war on drugs, leave it just to law enforcement.&quot;    In its 1988 bill, Congress moved to switch priorities by requiring that 60% of future federal spending on drugs be targeted to the &quot;demand side.&quot; The bill, which passed 346-11 in the House and by a voice vote in the Senate in the early morning just before lawmakers returned home to face voters, authorized dozens of programs. It would increase drug-abuse education, cocaine treatment and medical care for addicts with AIDS. Because of budget restrictions, most of these efforts weren't funded, but the legislation promised that Congress would spend &quot;such funds as may be necessary&quot; to operate the programs in the future.    But more money hasn't been provided. In a broader spending bill, the House recently did propose $822 million for drugs, but the Senate didn't vote any because of the Bush administration's budget worries. Congress settled on a compromise of $75 million, most of which will go for standard Justice Department needs, such as paying prosecutors and marshals.    &quot;We aren't funding the {antidrug} program,&quot; acknowledges Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. &quot;We aren't making an attempt like we promised the American people we would.&quot;    President Bush has proposed spending nearly $6 billion to fight drugs, a $1 billion increase, in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. He says he wants more prisons, more federal agents and more prosecutors -- the same shopping list Mr. Bennett, the drug czar, has emphasized in recent speeches. Mr. Bennett has promised to fight for as much as $1 billion more in drug spending on top of what the president proposed.    Once again, though, the budget may turn tough rhetoric into empty promises. When Mr. Bennett's plan comes out in September, Congress will be well on the way to carrying out the fiscal 1990 budget compromise that it reached with the White House earlier this year. If Mr. Bennett asks Congress for more money, he probably won't get it until the 1991 budget, administration officials say.    Laments one senior White House adviser: &quot;You can already hear the outraged attacks from the Hill: 'The Bush administration is doing nothing about drugs] The drug czar can't get anything done]'&quot;    Even if more drug programs were funded today, there wouldn't be a quick impact. Washington provides only about 20% of the total funds spent nationally on drug treatment and education; the rest comes from state, local and private sources. Nevertheless, federal money is crucial because it prompts matching allocations from state legislatures. &quot;Our only real way to expand programs is with federal money&quot; as the spur, says Alan Baker, an official with the Maryland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration.    The problem is that it takes years for money to move from Washington to localities. In Florida, which receives about half of its $66 million annual antidrug budget from Congress, federal money appropriated in 1986 is only now reaching cocaine-detoxification programs trying to cut months-long waiting lists, says Linda Lewis, the state's drug administrator. &quot;The bills in Washington always sound great, but we can't tell when we'll actually get the money,&quot; she says.    The labyrinthine flow of money would make even a grizzled bureaucrat dizzy. Typically, the first step in Florida, as in most states, is the governor's office applying for a share of federal grant money. If, months later, the money is granted, state agencies spend more months putting on &quot;dog and pony shows&quot; in hopes of getting a share, Ms. Lewis says. Meanwhile, the legislature, as part of the state's budget process, begins reviewing the allocation of all federal money granted to Florida. Legislators sometimes redirect expenditures within agencies to benefit their constituents. Only then, up to two years later, do state agencies start to solicit bids from private contractors who actually run treatment programs.    In addition, federal seed money is planted indiscriminately, and the results often aren't monitored. So, federal dollars support drastically different, and sometimes contradictory, treatment methods across the country. &quot;We're spending blindly,&quot; says Rep. Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat. &quot;We don't know what we've bought.&quot;    Baltimore County's drug-treatment center, for example, uses a &quot;holistic, family-oriented&quot; strategy in loosely structured group-therapy sessions. The center, partly funded by federal money, offers outpatient counseling in a squat three-story building near a suburban shopping mall. Counselors lead discussions on developing self-esteem and identifying stresses that contribute to drug use. Patients aren't required to have stopped taking drugs to get help; the staff believes it wouldn't be realistic to expect that in such a program. And there aren't any reliable statistics on success rates.    In contrast, Daytop Village, a program based in New York City and operating all over New York state with the aid of about $1 million a year in federal support, employs high-intensity &quot;therapeutic communities.&quot; These are group homes where patients live and perform menial labor under strict discipline. A central tenet at Daytop is that patients can't stay if they continue to use drugs. &quot;Drug-free is the only approach that works; otherwise {former addicts} inevitably go back to the stuff,&quot; contends Stan Satlin, Daytop's communications director.    Daytop patients agree. &quot;I couldn't trust myself,&quot; says Teddy Weinert, a 38-year-old former cocaine addict and alcoholic who lives at Daytop's New York City facility and has almost completed the program. &quot;With coke,&quot; he says, &quot;you need someone to force you to stop immediately -- cold turkey.&quot; Just under half of the people entering the Daytop program stay with it for its full 18 months, but Daytop surveys show that 92.5% of those finishing the program stay drug-free.    Federal officials admit chagrin over their failure to keep track of what happens to their grants. &quot;There is very little data collection and very little evaluation,&quot; says Joseph Autry, associate administrator of the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration. The agency, part of the Health and Human Services Department, will dispense $1.84 billion this fiscal year. But it has lacked &quot;the authority {and} the funding from Congress&quot; for more than nominal oversight, Dr. Autry says. The 1988 drug bill provided $40 million for a survey of 5% of the agency's state programs, but that hasn't begun yet, he adds.    A new push to emphasize demand-side efforts and research would be in direct contrast to the Reagan administration's approach. While Nancy Reagan was exhorting children to &quot;Just Say No to Drugs,&quot; her husband successfully pushed Congress to cut funding for treatment and prevention by 40% from 1981 through 1986. Research money was cut so sharply that drug research practically dried up.    Much of the research money has been restored recently, but, meanwhile, scientists have refitted laboratories for other projects or chosen different fields where grant money is more plentiful, says Herbert Kleber, an addiction researcher at Yale University. &quot;Now, there is lots of {federal} money available for research, but no one to do it,&quot; says Dr. Kleber, who will serve as a deputy to Mr. Bennett.    Mr. Bennett, who advocates throwing first-time drug offenders into military-style boot camps, says he supports treatment but can't tell what works. During a recent nationwide tour, he vowed to weed out &quot;fly-by-night&quot; treatment programs receiving federal aid and to favor those that emphasize coercion as well as therapy. &quot;Crack addicts don't just get up one morning and say, 'Hey, I think I'll go in for some treatment,'&quot; Mr. Bennett argues. &quot;You have to force people sometimes.&quot;    Despite the delays and wasted federal money, some antidrug efforts are reaching their targets. In the Baltimore County treatment program, two counselors see about 100 inmates a month in group sessions that focus on ways to kick cocaine and heroin. Although the program hasn't been formally evaluated, experts agree that prison treatment ought to be expanded because, nationwide, up to 70% of inmates have drug problems, which should be dealt with before prisoners are released.    Federal money, combined with state funds, allowed Joseph S., a convicted check forger, to get off a heavy cocaine habit. The wiry 24-year-old, who asked that his last name not be used, says the jail counseling program's simple message of self-reliance made him realize that &quot;it's up to me; if I do the cocaine, I'm going to do the crimes&quot; to get drug money. Grateful for his treatment during a recently completed 18-month sentence, Joseph claims he hasn't used drugs for months, though they had been available in the jail.    Ms. DeLeonardis is pleased that more federal antidrug money may be coming, but she isn't counting on it. &quot;I'd expand the jail counseling,&quot; she says, &quot;but who knows what will be 'in' next year in Washington and whether I'd have the money to pay the new counselors I'd like to hire.&quot;    ---@ Federal Antidrug Spending by Strategy @ (Fiscal years 1981-1989) @ Border Interdiction $7.1 billion @ Domestic Investigation $3.8 billion @ Drug-Abuse Prevention $2.4 billion @ Drug-Abuse Treatment $2.4 billion @ Prisons $2.2 billion @ International Investigation $1.1 billion @ Prosecution $1.0 billion @ State and Local Assistance $666 million @ Intelligence $306 million @ Regulatory Compliance $200 million @ Research and Development $109 million @ Source: U.S. General Accounting Office </TEXT></DOC>
