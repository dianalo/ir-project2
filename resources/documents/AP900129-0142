The 36 percentincrease would be the largest one-time jump for the program sinceit began 24 years ago.   Bush is asking Congress for $1.9 billion budget in multi-yearspending authority for Head Start for fiscal 1991, enough to raiseenrollment from 450,000 to 667,000 _ 70 percent of children aged 3through 5 from low-income families.   Bush's budget message to Congress called the program ``a keycomponent in achieving the readiness of all children to startschool.''   Besides giving preschoolers the social and learning skills tohelp them thrive in grade school, Head Start _ an agency of theHealth and Human Services Department _ screens children for medicaland dental problems and gives them two meals a day.   The president seeks an identical $500 million in budgetauthority for the Education Department _ $24.6 billion compared to$24.1 billion this year.   For fiscal 1991 alone, Bush asked Congress to approve a budgetof $23.7 billion, a 6.2 percent increase over this year's $22.3billion budget. The administration expects inflation this year tobe 4.1 percent.   The education budget targets $1.8 billion for initiatives andpriority areas, including preschool, elementary and secondaryeducation; mathematics and science education; dropout prevention;adult literacy, and drug education.   For the Chapter One program, which provides special educationalservices for low-achieving elementary and secondary students, Bushrequests a a $600 million increase to $5.1 billion.   And for the Even Start program, which provides basic educationsrvices to parents together with their children aged 1 through 7,Bush seeks to double the multi-year budget authority to $48 million.   In the area of education for the handicapped, the budgetproposes spending $2.2 billion in fiscal 1991, a $500 millionincrease that would provide more services to 355,000 preschoolchildren and would enhance the state programs that serve allinfants up to the age of 2, and their families.   ``The 1991 budget proposes the highest spending levels ever forprograms to prepare children for school and for discretionaryeducation programs,'' said the budget.   However, Bush's budget requests cuts in certain student loanprograms for college students, including a $600 million decrease inthe Guaranteed Student Loan program, to $3.2 billion from $3.8billion.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said that the student loanexpenditures would fall in 1991 because of a projected decrease ininterest rates.   While Bush requests a $473 million increase in the Pell Grantsprogram, which provides money to college student, over the current$4.8 billion, the budget seeks to cut the program next fall by$66.5 million.   As a result, about 14,000 students receiving awards averaging$200 would lose their grants, and 1.3 million other students willhave their stipends cut by $50.   The budget also seeks budget authority of $230 million for mathand science education, a 70 percent increase over what Congressprovided in 1990; $239 million for adult literary, an increase ofmore than 25 percent; and a $50 million increase to $590 millionfor drug prevention and anti-abuse programs.</TEXT></DOC>
