The U.S. negotiators wrung these pledges from officials ofthe Japanese Ministry of Post and Telecommunications justhours before a deadline set for the White House to determinewhether Japan is abiding by a number of telecommunicationsaccords with the U.S. The deadline was set by mutualagreement by the U.S. and Japan. The concessions made byJapan avert threatened trade sanctions against that country,according to the U.S. trade office.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills called the Japaneseagreement a &quot;major breakthrough,&quot; asserting that U.S.manufacturing, financial and other firms that requirecommunications services in Japan &quot;should be able to run thoseoperations more easily and economically.&quot;   The latest commitments give U.S. companies the right tosell network channel terminating equipment, or NCTEs,directly to Japanese customers, instead of through commoncarriers such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph andamp; TelephoneCorp. as required by current regulations. U.S. tradeofficials estimate the initial U.S. market share at $150million annually but much larger in the future.   NCTEs are similar to the modems used to transmit data overtelephone lines. These devices enable users ofpersonal-computer networks to exchange digitalized data.Direct access to Japanese customers could stimulate the U.S.sales of NCTEs because of the technical superiority of theU.S. products.   In another major concession, Tokyo has agreed to scrapseveral barriers to its market for international value-addednetworks, or IVANs. Such networks are the vehicles throughwhich electronic banking, voice mail, and othercommunications services are conducted across nationalboundaries.   The agreement gives U.S. providers of IVANs a shorter waitfor approval -- 30 days instead of several months -- andremoves the 20% surcharges that typically are levied bycommon carriers for the lease of their lines. Although theIVANs mostly link customers in the U.S. and Japan, the latestpackage gives Japan-based U.S. providers the right to serviceother countries.   U.S. providers currently have a fraction of Japan's $750million annual IVAN market, but their share could growsharply as a result of the agreement, U.S. officialspredicted.</TEXT></DOC>
