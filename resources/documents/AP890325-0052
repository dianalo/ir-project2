Police officials had no figures on injuries after 800 studentsfought riot police at Yonsei University in Seoul. No arrests werereported.   A rival pro-government rally at Seoul Municipal Stadium todayattracted 40,000 people who urged Roh to suppress leftist groups,according to Yonhap state news agency. The rally was organized byconservative groups representing people who fled communist NorthKorea after World War II.   Most Koreans do not support radical students, who before theriot denounced Roh and called for a joint struggle by students,workers and farmers to topple the government. Student leaderscriticized the United States for backing Roh.   ``Unite and overthrow the Roh Tae-woo regime,'' masked studentschanted as they pelted police with firebombs that exploded inbursts of blazing gasoline and flying glass.   Student representatives from 37 universities and colleges inSeoul met at Yonsei to inaugurate the ``Student StruggleHeadquarters for the Overthrow of the Roh Regime.'' Similar groupswill be formed in other parts of the nation, student leaders said.   About 4,000 riot police surrounded the sprawling campus ineastern Seoul, firing tear gas and hurling rocks at the attackingstudents. Police in armored vans fired salvos of choking tear gas,and troopers made several charges to drive the students back duringabout 90 minutes of fighting.   During their rally, the radical leaders also denounced Roh forhis March 20 decision to postpone indefinitely a promisedreferendum on his performance. Speakers said the action of Roh, anelected president, proved he was not committed to genuinedemocracy, and they called him a military dictator.   Roh cited the threat of radical protests when he called off thereferendum.   Speakers also demanded the immediate withdrawal of the 43,000U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   The radical students and allied dissident groups have littlepublic support, and most South Koreans reject their militancy.</TEXT></DOC>
