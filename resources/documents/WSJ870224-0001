SchmittStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RBAN SPC FBS USBC JAPANTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Rainier Bancorp. said it is considering acquisition proposals from two &quot;large out-of-state banking organizations,&quot; setting the stage for a takeover likely to rival the two biggest bank purchases ever.    Seattle-based Rainier wouldn't disclose the suitors, but sources said Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles made one of the offers. First Bank System Inc., based in Minneapolis, also is a likely suitor, analysts said. Spokesmen for Security Pacific and First Bank Systems declined to comment.    Security Pacific is offering securities valued at $50 to $55 for each of Rainier's common shares, banking industry sources said. Rainier has about 20.9 million shares outstanding and will issue another 1.1 million shares as part of its pending acquisition of Tacoma, Wash.-based United Bank. That would give the Security Pacific offer an indicated value of $1.1 billion to $1.21 billion.    Rainier's book value is $26.85 a share, and Security Pacific's offer of roughly twice the figure is consistent with premiums being paid for major U.S. banking concerns.    Rainier said both proposals include an exchange of common stock, at a &quot;substantial premium&quot; over the price before the proposals became known, but wouldn't elaborate. Rainier shares closed yesterday at $47.50, up $5.25, on heavy volume of slightly more than one million shares, in national over-the-counter trading. That would give the company an indicated value of $1.04 billion.    Although Rainier didn't announce the proposals until yesterday, trading in Rainier's stock on Friday suggests that word of the impending offers may have leaked out before the weekend. The company's shares rose $3.25 Friday, closing at $42.25, on unusually heavy volume of 271,000 shares.    Rainier said under both proposals, it would retain its Seattle headquarters, and operate as a separate unit under the same name. Rainier is evaluating both proposals and said it expects to make a decision this week.    Security Pacific's offer reflects its aggressive acquisition strategy in the wake of collapsing barriers to interstate banking in the West. Last year, the banking concern acquired or agreed to acquire major banks in Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, and it has been beefing up its retail banking in northern California. The surging interest in retail banking is somewhat ironic because Security Pacific has made its name in recent years through a diversified investment-banking operation.    Some analysts said $1 billion was a hefty sum for a Northwest bank faced with a slowly recovering forest products industry. Security Pacific, sources said, believes it can boost profits at Rainier through centralizing technologies and selling off related businesses, such as Rainier's large mortgage company. In addition, sources said Security Pacific hopes to sell many of its investment-banking services, such as interest-rate swaps, to Rainier's commercial and industrial customers.    In an interview last month, G. Robert Truex Jr., Rainier's chairman and chief executive officer, said the bank had been the target of &quot;keen interest&quot; among undisclosed bidders and was weighing the possibility of being taken over. Mr. Truex also indicated that a bid approximating twice book value would be difficult to resist.    Mr. Truex, who according to the 1986 proxy owns 146,752 shares, stands to reap a healthy profit from an acquisition. Assuming a purchase price of $50 to $55 a share, he would receive between $7.3 million and $8.1 million. According to the 1986 proxy, John D. Mangels, Rainier's president, holds 74,700 shares including options and would receive between $3.7 million and $4.1 million.    Like other Pacific Northwest banks, Rainier believes its problem loans to forest products companies have bottomed out; it also is drawing increasing business from growing trade across the Pacific.    With assets of $9.2 billion, Rainier has long been the largest banking concern with headquarters in the Pacific Northwest, although U.S. Bancorp. is eclipsing it with a pending acquisition of its own. Portland, Ore.-based U.S. Bancorp. also has informally expressed interest in the past in acquiring Rainier, but a spokesman yesterday said it didn't make one of the two offers. Rainier has made a number of recent acquisitions, the latest being the $59 million purchase of United Bank last April.    J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said Security Pacific and First Bank System could be interested in Rainier geographic diversification, but such an acquisition would initially dilute either company's earnings.    Because of Rainier's position on the Pacific Rim, it has been rumored to be an attractive target for a Japanese or Far Eastern concern. Mr. Fredericks said he &quot;wouldn't dismiss&quot; that possibility, but called it a long shot.    For First Bank, the acquisition of Rainier would substantially fulfill its stated goal of forging a network of strong banks across the Upper Midwest to Seattle. First Bank already operates banks in the Upper Midwest states, and in September it purchased a small, failing institution in Omak, Wash., with $41 million of assets.    At the time, D.H. Ankeny Jr., chairman and chief executive of First Bank, said, &quot;While this is a small acquisition, it gives us a presence in a state we view as important, and an opportunity to expand our service area.&quot;    Robert G. Mellem, an analyst in Seattle with Minneapolis-based Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc., notes that First Bank raised its dividend 50% last week, and suspects that may have been done to increase its stock price, thus reducing the cost of a stock acquisition.    Security Pacific's shares closed yesterday at $40.25, down $1.25, and First Bank closed at $33, down $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. However, all major bank stocks were hurt yesterday because of Brazil's plans to suspend interest payments on its debt.    The two biggest banking acquisitions to date are Chemical New York Corp.'s proposal to buy Texas Commerce Bancshares and Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s purchase last year of Crocker National Corp. Chemical agreed to pay as much as $1.19 billion in securities, but that proposal is highly contingent on Texas Commerce's future earnings. Wells Fargo paid $1.07 billion in cash for Crocker.    ---                    Rainier Bancorp.                         1986              1985 Assets                  $9.2 billion      $8.3 billion Deposits                $6.63 billion     $5.84 billion Nonperforming assets    $188 million      $223 million Net income              $70 million       $65.2 million Per share               $3.41             $3.26 Return on assets        0.84%             0.88% Return on equity        13.4%             14.0% Current number of employees: 5,500 Shares outstanding: 20.9 million</TEXT></DOC>
