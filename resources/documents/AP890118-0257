The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported in Tuesday's editions thatthe deal would have to be approved by the board of directors of AMRCorp., American's parent. The board's monthly meeting is scheduledfor today.   But American spokesman Al Becker described the report as ``highlyspeculative.''   The newspaper said the airline, owner of the largest commercialjet fleet in the non-communist world, will order 60 long-rangeMcDonnell Douglas MD-11s for an estimated $5.4 billion and 100domestic-range MD-80s for an estimated $2 billion more.   American decided to buy the MD-11, which has yet to make itsfirst flight, instead of the Boeing 747-400, the newest, largest andlongest-range of Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.'s line of jumbojets, the newspaper quoted Wall Street and industry sources assaying.   The Star-Telegram said the deals will be announced within thenext three weeks, as soon as final language of the contract isworked out.   Becker, asked to comment on the report, said: ``We have notsigned any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of theaircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent.''   ``The article is highly speculative,'' Becker said when reachedby The Associated Press at American's headquarters in Fort Worth.   But Becker noted that American has been evaluating both the MD-11and the Boeing 747-400 as part of its preparation for expansion inthe Pacific and European air markets.   The airline has 465 jets in its fleet. Aeroflot, the SovietUnion's state-owned carrier, has the world's largest fleet. Americanalso has an additional 213 planes either on order or option.   McDonnell Douglas Corp. head offices in St. Louis, Mo., referredthe AP's calls about the possible MD-11 and MD-80 purchases to DonHanson, the company's spokesman in Los Angeles. A secretary inHanson's office said he was not immediately available Tuesday.   To McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 2 commercial jetlinermaker, American's acquisition would represent an isolated win in itscompetition against the larger, wealthier Boeing. It would virtuallyassure more sales, said Paul Turk, a spokesman for Avmark Inc., aWashington, D.C., firm that consults with airlines on aircraftacquisitions.   McDonnell Douglas, as 1988 ended, had orders, options and othercommitments for as many as 250 MD-11s. But until Delta Air Linesannounced in September its order for 40, McDonnell Douglas had downpayments in hand for only 40.   Turk said one reward for being a so-called launch customer for anew type of aircraft is a discount as high as 30 percent off theplane's list price.   ``The MD-11 has been sold for $100 million to $110 million inones and twos,'' Turk said. ``We're estimating that Delta is payingright at about $90 million per plane for its batch. And American,with its reputation for getting the best price anyone can get,probably will be paying about $90 million per copy, too,'' he toldthe Star-Telegram.</TEXT></DOC>
