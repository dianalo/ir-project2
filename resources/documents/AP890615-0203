(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Capitol is a place of ``highcuriosity and low anxiety'' nearly a year after a group of Alabamanswho doled out $100,000 for legislative favors turned out to be FBIagents hunting corruption.   Since 30 federal agents raided the offices of four legislatorsand their aides the night of Aug. 24, 1988, one lawmaker has beenindicted for bribery, extortion and money laundering and severalothers are under investigation.   ``We've lived with this for a year now, so that the initial shockhas worn off,'' said Bob Forsyth, a top Senate aide. ``The curiositynow is about who's next and if they'll be somebody next. There mustbe a few people here privately who are worried, but generally thereis high curiosity and low anxiety.''   The raid revealed a complex 3{-year sting in which the FBI set upphony companies to dispense cash for special-interest legislation.Agents videotaped lawmakers taking cash, according to the lawyer fora key FBI informant.   The FBI descended on the Capitol after a legislative aidereportedly refused to work as an informant and agents feared shewould tip other people. As the agents moved through the building,several staffers reportedly shredded documents and erased sensitivefiles from computers.   Sen. Joseph Montoya, one of the four lawmakers whose offices weresearched, pleaded innocent June 12 to 10 counts of violating theHobbs Act, which is used in bribery cases involving publicofficials, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt OrganizationsAct. The El Monte Democrat, who has served 17 years in theLegislature, faces $2.5 million in fines and 200 years in prison ifconvicted. An aide, Amiel Jaramillo, pleaded innocent to threecounts.   The other three whose offices were searched, all members of theAssembly, are Gwen Moore, D-Los Angeles, and Republicans Pat Nolanof Glendale and Frank Hill of Whittier. Nolan served as Republicanleader of the Democrat-dominated Assembly until he stepped down,partly because of the FBI investigation.   The San Francisco Examiner reported Tuesday that IRS agentsassisting the FBI had subpoenaed the files on 16 bills carried bySen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee.Robbins declined to comment.   Except for Montoya, no lawmaker has been indicted or arrested.All have denied any wrongdoing.   The undercover agents gave more than $90,000 in campaigncontributions, honoraria and other payments to state and localofficials, aides, campaign consultants and others, according togovernment and private financial records obtained by The AssociatedPress. A federal source knowledgeable with the investigation said``about $100,000, maybe a little more'' was budgeted.   About a fifth of the money went to Paul Carpenter, a former statesenator and now a member of the powerful-but-obscure Board ofEqualization, which sets property tax assessments for utilities andis California's tax appeals agency.   Carpenter received three payments in 1986 totaling $20,000.Carpenter said he was interviewed by the FBI, but has declined todiscuss the case further.   Moore, Hill and Nolan got several thousand dollars each, andother minor contributions were scattered throughout the Legislature.   The sting has been dubbed ``Capscam'' or ``Shrimpscam'' by themedia, but its official FBI file name is ``Brispec,'' for ``Bribery_ Special Interest.'' According to documents, sources and publishedreports, here is how it worked:   FBI agents posed as representatives of a Mobile, Ala.-basedcompany planning to launch a shrimp-processing plant in WestSacramento. They went to lawmakers, seeking legislation that wouldlure investment to the phony company as they spread donations aroundthe Capitol.   Ultimately, two bills pushed by the undercover agents wereapproved by the Legislature. Both _ written by Moore _ were vetoedby Gov. George Deukmejian, who had been tipped off by the FBI.   One agent, who identified himself as ``Jack Gordon of Alabama,''was an engaging, country-bumpkin type who became a familiar figurein the Capitol. He was often accompanied on his Capitol rounds byJohn Shahabian, a Senate staffer who was serving the FBI as anundercover informant.   Shahabian's lawyer, Sacramento attorney Donald Heller, said hisclient was involved in audio and video recordings of lawmakerstaking money.   The FBI probe was secret until Aug. 24. As about 30 agentsgathered in the Hyatt Regency Hotel across the street from theCapitol, others were inside the statehouse interviewing KarenWatson, an aide to Nolan. During the interview, the agentsreportedly asked Watson to work as an informant. She refused.   Within minutes, agents left the hotel and headed for the Capitol.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, June 19</NOTE></DOC>
