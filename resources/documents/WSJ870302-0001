The suit, filed in Superior Court, seeks class action status and asks that $184.5 million distributed to shareholders in a leveraged buyout be used to pay medical and retirement benefits for employees and retirees. The defendants are seven board members of Kaiser Steel at the time of the 1984 leveraged buyout and investors Ivan Boesky, Irwin Jacobs and J.A. Frates.    The suit contends that Messrs. Boesky and Jacobs held about 1.7 million of Kaiser Steel's 7.3 million common shares and &quot;orchestrated&quot; the leveraged buyout.    In early 1984 two investor groups, one led by Mr. Frates, an Oklahoma businessman, and one led by Monte H. Rial, who controlled the closely held Perma group of companies, bought Kaiser for $374.4 million in a leveraged buyout. Each group got 50% of Kaiser's common stock. In April 1985 the Frates group sold its stake to Perma. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The suit alleges that in connection with the leveraged buyout, management obtained appraisals that grossly overstated the value of the company's assets and understated its obligations to past employees. The suit contends that the distribution of cash and preferred stock in the leveraged buyout forced the company to file for Chapter 11. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.    Recently the company stopped paying medical and pension benefits, the suit says.    A spokesman for Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Kaiser said the company hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment.    Mr. Jacobs couldn't be reached for comment. James B. Farrell, a vice president and general counsel of Minstar Inc., a company Mr. Jacobs heads, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment.    In Tulsa, Okla., Mr. Frates couldn't be reached for comment.    In Washington, Theodore Levine, an attorney for Mr. Boesky, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment.
