Against the green carpet of his office, their black leather gleams as if spit-shined. But a conversation with South Korea's leading presidential contender, Roh Tae-Woo, makes it clear that the current preoccupation of this retired four-star general is not the army, his ruling party nor his controversial president, but his own promise of a democratic transition.    &quot;I feel the heavy pressure, the responsibility,&quot; he says. &quot;And I have some sleepless hours.&quot;    On June 10, Mr. Roh (pronounced Noh) accepted the Democratic Justice Party's nomination for the South Korean presidency. Coming after President Chun Doo Hwan's April decision to scrap constitutional reform until after the next election and the 1988 Seoul Olympics, this triggered 19 days of growing protests and riots nationwide. Many feared that were he to accede to the Blue House next February he would serve merely as a token president, taking orders from Mr. Chun. On June 29, Mr. Roh seized the initiative with a surprise, eight-point declaration. He proposed fair, direct elections, amnesty for most political prisoners and broad civil liberties. He threatened to resign both as DJP chairman and presidential nominee were his plan not accepted. That same day the mass protests stopped. Two days later, President Chun eloquently endorsed the plan.    If Mr. Roh is under pressure, it's not obvious during an interview. Seated at a wooden table in the tidy office that he uses part time on the third floor of a high-rise building near the DJP headquarters, he gets up to show a visitor to a chair. He offers a firm handshake, a cup of tea and a greeting in English. The rest of the conversation takes place through a translator.    Why did he make his June 29th announcement?    &quot;What I had in mind at the time was that I had been given the role to make this country into a more mature, developed democracy. If I am able to perform this, I will be satisfied, because I will be recorded in Korean history as the person who made this development possible.&quot; He speaks slowly, thoughtfully. He frequently touches his right hand to his chest. He looks his visitor in the eye.    But even with fair elections, is he now facing a genuine contest? The &quot;two Kims&quot; of the opposition, Kim Young-Sam and Kim Dae-Jung, have been jockeying for an opposition nomination that has yet to be made. &quot;When I made the special statement of June 29, I didn't consider whether I was running against another party's candidate,&quot; says Mr. Roh. His main concern, he says, was that his proposal meet with general approval, and he is satisfied. &quot;I've seen the outpouring of support, not only from the Korean people, but also the support coming from abroad.&quot;    Is President Chun solidly behind democratization? Mr. Roh clears his throat and looks away. President Chun, he says, has &quot;made it quite clear to all the Korean people that he is fully behind my proposal. In particular, he instructed his cabinet to take the measures necessary for the implementation of my proposal.&quot; Mr. Roh says he is pleased with a recent cabinet shuffle and believes the changes will help bring &quot;impartial management of the election process.&quot; He notes that the opposition disagrees. Kim Dae-Jung has been demanding a coalition, caretaker government until February; Kim Young-Sam is asking for the resignation of the new prime minister, Kim Chung-Yul. As Mr. Roh sees it: &quot;The basic principle is that we should have a fair election for our next president.&quot;    Other changes have come fast as well. President Chun has distanced himself somewhat from the DJP, handing over the party presidency to Mr. Roh. Mr. Chun has been appointed honorary party president. The government also has released 534 political prisoners, and granted amnesty to 2,335 political dissidents, including opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung. Not only have these moves failed so far to satisfy the opposition, they also seem to be whetting an appetite for more government concessions. Both Kims are demanding that Mr. Chun leave the DJP altogether and that more political prisoners be released. They also are saying that amends must be made to the families of the civilians killed by troops in the 1980 Kwangju uprising, which took place while Mr. Roh was still on active duty in charge of the Seoul Security Command and which led to Kim Dae-Jung's own conviction of treason for his role in the riots.    Asked how he will react if the opposition keeps adding demands, Mr. Roh says that the transition process turns on two principles: &quot;liberal democracy and a free-market economy.&quot; These things, he says, &quot;cannot be negotiated away or compromised.&quot; Within this limit, though, &quot;everything can be negotiated, and we'll give as much as possible if it is required for democratic reform.&quot; He already has stated publicly that he favors some amends for Kwangju.    One of his big worries, however, is that &quot;there are some radical elements now forming an alliance of convenience with the opposition party.&quot; There are some, says Mr. Roh, &quot;who would like to overthrow the existing system by violence. With them, the opposition's freedom of movement is very limited.&quot;    The release of all political dissidents still imprisoned he describes as &quot;an understandable and humanitarian consideration,&quot; but &quot;somewhat too drastic.&quot; Some of them, he says, &quot;would engage once again in destructive actions.&quot; He brings up North Korea, though not by name: &quot;This is especially true when you consider that this country is facing a real threat across the demilitarized zone. They're trying to overthrow South Korea by any possible means. . . . If we make some error it could develop into a real catastrophe.&quot; This view, he believes, &quot;is shared by my party and to a large extent by the majority of the Korean people.&quot;    On how well South Korea can mix domestic freedom with national security, he offers an explanation that he has been giving to a DJP audience for some time. &quot;Since the birth of this republic, we have had to grapple with three fundamental tasks. That is, to secure the survival of the country, to see the economy developed, and in doing all this to develop the country into a more mature democracy. In the initial stage, security was our main concern. In the next stage, we were able to make economic progress, based on national security. But now is the stage at which people want us to have democratic development.&quot;    For the Korean economy, he favors free trade. &quot;I think we have to open our markets.&quot; He adds that &quot;more effort should be made to realize a fair distribution of income,&quot; but he is short on specifics. &quot;The policy needed for this will be further developed.&quot;    With all the obstacles and the scant time, does he really think a peaceful transition to democracy can be achieved?    He answers that the only course is to soldier on and find out. &quot;Because I have put everything at stake by making this move, all I have to do is do my best.&quot;    He touches his chest as he makes his point. &quot;I have a firm belief that when I do my best, heaven will help me.&quot;    ---   Miss Rosett is editorial-page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
