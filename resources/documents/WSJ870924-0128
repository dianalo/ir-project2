Budget -- which had its initial public offering in May following last year's management buy-out -- predicted profit for the period would exceed $5.1 million, or 50 cents a share, on a higher number of shares than in the first half of the year. In last year's third quarter, the company earned $3.7 million, or 34 cents a share.    Clifton E. Haley, president and chief operating officer, said Budget is projecting third-quarter revenue of $117 million to $120 million, up from $91.2 million a year earlier.    For the full year, the company said it expects to equal or exceed analysts' earnings projections of $1.15 to $1.20 a share. Budget earned 63 cents a share a year earlier.    In the coming months, Budget should benefit from continued strong growth in the travel and rental car industry, especially in rentals for personal use -- the fastest-growing segment of the business, Mr. Haley said in an interview.    As a long-term strategy, Budget will continue to acquire and operate more of its franchised rental car locations, Mr. Haley said. Budget has acquired three major franchises in the past several months and now operates 36% of its U.S. fleet. </TEXT></DOC>
