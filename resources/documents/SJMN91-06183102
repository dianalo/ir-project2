Just as important iswhat you'll get for your money when you have to file a claim. How's a consumerto evaluate that?;    The state's Department of Insurance is offering somehelp. The department can be a useful clearinghouse for all sorts ofinformation, especially since Proposition 103, passed by voters in November1988, requires insurance companies to disclose much more information thanpreviously.;    The department demonstrated what it could do with the releasethis week of statistics showing which insurance companies generated the mostcomplaints.;    Such a table doesn't tell the whole story, of course.Insurance companies note that complaints are only a small fraction of policieswritten. True, but claims are only a fraction of policies written, and fewpeople are likely to be complaining except about inadequate handling ofclaims.;    The information the department compiled is a step toward what itcould do to help insurance consumers make smarter decisions.
