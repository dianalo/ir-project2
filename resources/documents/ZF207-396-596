 For others, they personify a trend inwhich centers of innovation have shifted from vendors to customers and areseen as a vital link in the industry's evolution.andP;  They're the multitude ofIS shops inside organizations that are now open for business to outsidecustomers.andP;  Found anywhere from tiny university departments to vastindustrials in the Midwest, these &quot;spinouts&quot; are hawking everything fromsoftware to services to overall facilities management (FM).andM;What's good for these IS shops seems to be good for big business.andP;  IBM seesthem as an extension to its marketing organization.andP;  Software companies wantto harness their Randamp;D firepower.andP;  And the industry may need their expertise toclimb out of its slump.andP;  Whether they've got bodies, code or industryknowhow, IS shops around the world are packaging their expertise and puttingit up for sale.andM;The roster of companies whose IS departments now serve two masters, bothinternal and external customers, grows daily and includes such big names asAmerican Airlines Inc., Bechtel Group Inc., Caterpillar Inc., First BostonCorp., Kimberly-Clark Inc., Mellon Bank, The Travelers Corp. and WeyerhaeuserCorp.andP;  Despite the perceived potential, however, some corporations aresteering clear of such initiatives because their IS departments have theirhands full or because they fear a conflict of interest.andM;Corporations such as Aetna Life andamp; Casualty insist that IS should be dedicatedsolely to the business it is a part of.andP;  However, despite its claim that IShas no business being in business for itself, Aetna is not averse to buyingproducts from such IS spinouts--even those created by its competitors.andP;  Andothers that have pooh-poohed the idea of IS selling itself believe that it'slikely such ventures will evolve as extensions to electronic data interchangenetworks.andM;The new wave of IS spinouts shouldn't be confused with the activities ofAmerican Express Inc., whose $450 million external IS business, AmericanExpress Information Services Co., is the cumulative result of 10 years ofacquisitions.andP;  The ventures tracked by DATAMATION are a direct outgrowth ofan internal IS operation.andP;  For example, Johns Hopkins University ofBaltimore, Md., which spun out its alumni services arm five years ago, isself supporting and acts as a marketing company through sales of alumnidirectories and direct mail.andM;In general, universities are headed down the same road as large corporations.andO;&quot;We're already self supporting, and our schools and faculties are not captivecustomers [they can and do buy outside],&quot; says Maurice Murphy, director ofNetwork Services at Harvard University's Office for Information Technology,in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Murphy, who was lured away from Polaroid Corp., expectscorporate talent to be recruited in growing numbers to put university ISdepartments on a more business-like and, eventually, sales-oriented footing.andM;However, the IS spinout concept isn't new; after all, aerospace companieshave been turning underutilized data centers into profit centers for years byselling both software and computer time.andP;  Some big names, such as LockheedCorp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., are even retreating from this type ofbusiness.andP;  Aren't the current crop of spinouts just more of the same?andP;  Ordoes this round of big IS shops peddling their wares on the outside reflect asingular need to cut costs?andM;There is some merit in this latter view, say IS managers.andP;  IS spinoutssometimes follow in the wake of business reversals or result from corporatedownsizing or cost containment.andP;  But there seem to be other forces at play inthe current trend, too.andM;Many corporations are simply tired of what some refer to as reinventing thewheel.andP;  &quot;Why should I try and recreate a bunch of standards for applicationsdevelopment if they already exist?&quot; asks Jim Beitel, executive vice presidentof Information Services at Nebraska-based First Federal of Lincoln,discussing his decision to buy from an IS spinout.andM;Beitel had been waiting for his vendor, Computer Associates InternationalInc. of Garden City, N.Y., to come up with new CASE tools for his CA-Datacom/DB data base manager and CA-Ideal programming language.andP;  &quot;I don't doubt thatover time we could have built something,&quot; he says, &quot;but at a user groupmeeting we found that some other CA customer already had.andP;  So we're buyingfrom them.&quot;andP;  That other customer is paper goods manufacturer Kimberly-Clark,which has just launched a spinout, Kimberly-Clark Computer Services Inc. inIrving, Texas, to sell the fruits of its internal development.andM;Another spinout customer is L.F.andP;  Rothschild Unterberg Towbin Inc. of NewYork City.andP;  Hank Hogan, a former applications manager at the company, saysthat internal IS staffers at the finance house could have handled themultiple conversions from IBM's DOS/VSE to MVS operating systems that werecompleted this March.andP;  &quot;But it made sense to job this type of grunt work outto someone else,&quot; he says.andP;  This work helped launch the Caterpillar spinout,Caterpillar Professional Systems Group in Peoria, Ill.andP;  &quot;Who knows the needsof an IS department better than another IS department?&quot;andP;  Hogan muses.andP;  Manytimes it is the user group grapevine or informal visits by IS staffers topeers at other sites that provide the impetus for new IS ventures.andM;And there seem to be few qualms about buying from such techies.andP;  &quot;If it's theright technology, you'd buy from the devil himself--or, worse still, fromcompetitors,&quot; quips Ali Firouz, a business systems consultant at Chubb andamp; SonInc. of Warren, N.J.andP;  Firouz is buying a program-testing-and-debugging toolfrom another insurance company, &quot;because it's the best solution out there.&quot;andO;He also notes that the parents of IS ventures are often corporations withdeep pockets.andP;  &quot;And it's they who are accountable if anything goes wrong.andO;Often, there's less risk than buying from an independent software vendor.andP;  Iknow that Travelers [the IS organization he buys from] will still be aroundnext year or 10 years from now.&quot;andM;Software companies are also driving the trend to the selling of IS byemerging as big buyers of IS shops' products.andP;  Leading software companiessuch as McCormack andamp; Dodge in Natick, Mass., and Pansophic Systems Inc. of OakBrook, Ill., test and debug their applications using a tool that came from anIS spinout.andP;  &quot;We have a program that is a cruder form of Travelers' TRAPSoffering,&quot; says Don Friswell, a product design and quality assuranceconsultant at McCormack andamp; Dodge.andP;  &quot;We could plow money into this or intoTRAPS.andP;  It makes more sense to choose the latter.&quot;andP;  TRAPS stands for Testing,Recording andamp; Playback System.andP;  It is a PC-based program that unearths bugs insoftware before they surface in expensive production systems.andM;Friswell says that many IS shops are capable of producing hit software.andO;&quot;With the right marketing and distribution, they can take their place in thevendor community,&quot; he says--adding that there is a big opportunity forsoftware companies to become the selling fronts for legions of techies in DPshops.andM;If IS as a separate business is rooted in anything, it's in the industry'sneed to solve acute problems, Friswell and other experts note.andP;  &quot;Customersare only interested in quality and solutions.andP;  They no longer care where theparts come from,&quot; says Friswell.andP;  Partnerships and technology exchanges arethe industry's way of putting heads together to surmount its softwareproductivity crisis and reduce development costs.andM;Computer vendors, independent software vendors (ISVs) and, more recently,consultant/integrators have grappled with the industry's problems for sometime, but they have lacked a pool of expertise that the IS shop can provide.andO;Bob Hughes, Digital Equipment Corp.'s vice president of services industrymarketing, once said that the biggest barrier to industry growth was ascarcity of network integrators, in particular, project managers (bothinternal and external to IS shops) with such expertise.andP;  Frank Guthrie, avice president at the forest products giant, Weyerhaeuser of Tacoma, Wash.,andO;believes that with increased exposure to outside customers, IS shoptechnicians could help fill this void.andM;Industry experts have looked for the next software best-sellers to come fromthe ISVs.andP;  But they may have to revise that outlook.andP;  The software packagecreated deep within the bowels of The Travelers, TRAPS, is already abest-seller and the subject of three user group gatherings in 1988 alone.andM;More than 100 companies have bought TRAPS.andP;  Art Quirk, president of theTravelers spinout, Travtech Inc., says that some clients have bought severalhundred copies each.andP;  TRAPS is priced at $18,000 per five copies and $1,500for each additional copy.andM;By some strange twist of fate, an adjunct product for TRAPS, calledScore-board, comes from an abandoned IS venture that had been known asHitech.andP;  This Hartford Insurance spinout was a pioneer of integrated CASEtools back in 1985 and 1986.andP;  The company lost millions because the marketwasn't ripe.andP;  But, as a part of its legacy, its Scoreboard program has arating system that determines whether a program should go into production andis now being marketed exclusively by Travtech.andM;Meanwhile, the potential for Is to sell itself has not been lost on IBM.andP;  Ascarcity of technical talent, applications expertise and even of funds attimes have forced IBM to reevaluate how it develops its systems.andP;  For IBM,getting the job done often means going outside.andP;  The computer giant wouldlove these IS ventures to weave their solutions around its flagship 309Xmainframes to help dispel the growing perception that such machines are&quot;dinosaurs.&quot;andP;  Those IS shops that do, and there are numerous examplesalready, could be viewed as extensions of IBM's marketing organization.andM;But there are dangers to IBM from such immense IS spinouts.andP;  &quot;We started outin IBM's good books,&quot; says Dean Fitzbag, manager of data communications forGeneral Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp., the company thatpioneered FM back in the early 1960s.andP;  &quot;But we reached a point when we didn'talways replace of IBM equipment with its new offerings.andP;  Sometimes DEC or IBMplug-compatible machines were a better choice.&quot;andM;Mellon's Spinout StrategyandM;The potential for reward and the corresponding potential for peril exists foruser organizations, too, which in recent years have farmed out a colossalamount of IS work to outsiders.andM;A case in point is Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, a leading edge IBM test sitethat is generally regarded as one of the classiest maniframe shops in thecountry.andP;  Last year, reveals senior vice president of MIS George DiNardo, thebank's big iron processed over $1.5 billion worth of business, 51% of whichwas for outside clients, such as banks, trusts and stock transfer companies.andO;Every one of these customers, and those that DiNardo has yet to attract, is aMIPS sponge for the next generation of IBM maniframes.andM;The next step in DiNardo's strategy--the bank's outside IS activities havebeen going on for some time but are not formally organized as a spinout--isentry into the FM, or total solutions, business.andP;  Mellon will buy the DPoperations of misized banks and hard-pressed mutual funds concerns and runthem at a fixed cost to the client.andP;  The client gets a much-needed infusionof cash and can focus purely on the business at hand.andP;  Mellon gets arecurring, predictable source of revenue to offset the wild, cyclical swingsof banking.andM;But there has also been a downside.andP;  DiNardo admits to selling a gigantictrust system to its competition, two large banks, in 1974.andP;  &quot;We gave them thejewels,&quot; he says.andP;  One bank botched it up terribly and couldn't get thesystem to run.andP;  A win for Mellon.andP;  The other client made hay with thesoftware and gave Mellon a terrible beating in the pension managementbusiness.andP;  Mellon lost.andM;While it's true that IS spinout spring from partnerships, technologyexchanges and the demand for more intellectual firepower, it's also clearthat some of the breed are created for less laudable reasons.andP;  Since top ISprofessionals and their organizations are generally viewed as cost centers bythe executive suite, it's a simple matter to package them and job them out tothe highest bidder if their cost dynamics are favorable.andM;&quot;This is the bad news,&quot; says professor James Wetherbe, director of theUniversity of Minnesota's MIS Research Center.andP;  &quot;You don't view IS as aseparate cost center if it's something integral to your business, somethingthat differentiates you from the competition and gives you a strategic edge.&quot;andM;Adds Jeffrey Alperin, assistant vice president of corporate technologyplanning at giant insurer.andP;  Aetna: &quot;You don't spin off your IS department ifit's viewed as a business partner by top management.andP;  You use it to clobberthe competition.&quot;andP;  Alperin, a critic of the spinout trend, says that thoughmany exceptions exist in the form of ventures that complement a company'smain business, many are merely &quot;selling cheap MIPS and bodies, often in thewake of reversals in their main businesses.&quot;andM;One other critic goes even further.andP;  &quot;[It's] merely a product of the currentcorporate preoccupation with downsizing and cost containment.andP;  I believe it'sa passing fad,&quot; says M. Victor Janulaitis, chief executive at the LosAngeles-based consultancy, Positive Support Review.andM;Nick Simonds, director of MIS at Chrysler Corp. in Detroit, raises anotherobjection, saying that his management has steered clear of spinoutinitiatives because of the dangers of IS trying to serve two masters.andP;  &quot;It'seasy to get distracted from the mission of serving your own business,&quot; hesays, noting that outside clients would tend to lure away top technicaltalent &quot;especially if they were high pay/big perks consultant/integrators.&quot;andM;This is the line taken by other large corporations such as Merrill Lynch,Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith, Inc., Security Pacific Automation Co. and Aetna.andP;  Buteven these concerns agree that spinouts could accelerate as the degree ofcustomer involvement in electronic data interchange grows.andP;  &quot;We're putting anew national satellite network in for our dealers, and we could end upoffering it to other sources--advertisers, financial companies and so on,&quot;says Simonds.andP;  He would consider this an example of where spinouts complementrather than detract from a company's main business.andM;But nagging questions remain: Does a spinout advance the company or just itstechnical staffs?andP;  And, is it possible for IS to serve two masters and stillsupport its company's core mission without distraction and dilution of itsefforts?andM;The answers could go either way, and perhaps therein lies the secret.andP;  Truecompetitiveness lies beyond software and technology.andP;  The best and thebrightest will always win.andP;  If the spinout trend is a reflection of awell-differentiated company that views IS as a business partner, IS managerseverywhere will win.andP;  Going public with such expertise can only give thewhole industry a much-needed shot in the arm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
