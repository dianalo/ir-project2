This interesting portrait of their marriageblends up-to-date churnings about the role of women withold-fashioned Hollywood heroics about the great and famous.The insistent beat of affirmation and endurance here will befamiliar to moviegoers past a certain age. From time to time,indeed, O'Keeffe and Steiglitz sound a lot like Madame Curieand husband Pierre. In the film's more contemporary moments,O'Keeffe is depicted as unable to contain her lust for theaging Stieglitz. At one point, she thrusts her hand under thedining-room table and fondles Alfred. At another, theinsatiable O'Keeffe is shown entreating her flattered spouseto leave off rowboating and come back to the bedroom. If thereal O'Keeffe did not confine herself exclusively toheterosexuality, as a recent biography claims, no one isabout to hear of it from this film, which offersdistinguished performances by Christopher Plummer and JaneAlexander.   -- 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS.

Saturday, July 20                          Doublecrossed                                                                                                          Dennis Hopper stars as a cocaine smuggler turnedgovernment informant in this tale roughly based on the lifeand career of Barry Seal. His transformation was inspired byhis wish to escape prosecution. But having risked his lifeheroically to fulfill his part of the bargain and then some,Seal was ultimately and fatally betrayed. According to thisstory, it was a betrayal orchestrated by that omnipotent evilthat never ceases to haunt the minds of our film writers,namely the CIA. This saga also includes a portrait of Lt.Col. Oliver North as a ruthless Ken doll responsible forblowing Seal's cover. The film is generally absorbing, as isMr. Hopper's nerve-jangling performance. To get to enjoy anyof this, however, we must first endure execrable jokiness,corn-pone atmospherics, unspeakable musical accompaniment andother misbegotten efforts at lightheartedness.   -- 9-11 p.m. EDT, on HBO.                                                                                                                              Wednesday, July 24                         Morton andamp; Hayes                                                                                                          A spoof meant to evoke the revels of Abbott and Costelloand Laurel and Hardy, &quot;Morton andamp; Hayes&quot; (portrayed by KevinPollak and Bob Amaral) chronicles the mishaps of a fictionaldetective duo. The adventures of this pair of bumblers --compared to them Clouseau was Sherlock Holmes -- supposedlycome from the just-discovered vault of fictitious filmproducer Max King. Not that the history matters, since it isclear fairly early that wherever these two sleuths came fromthey are welcome. So is the script by Phil Mishkin, which isliterate, at least as such things go nowadays. CatherineO'Hara does a fine turn as the private eyes' first customer,Mrs. Amelia Von Astor. This particular piece of summer fareis actually funny, which is more than can be said of most ofwhat passes for comedy in the regular season.   -- 8:30-9 p.m. EDT, on CBS.                                                                                                                               Sunday, July 28                        Naked Hollywood                                                                                                          This series, advertised as a scrutiny of the filmindustry, is supposedly causing consternation among Hollywoodtypes. It is hard to see why from the initial segment. Itstitle is &quot;The Actor and the Star,&quot; the actor being JamesCaan, of whom we see too little, though what there is iscurious and gripping. The star is Arnold Schwarzenegger, ofwhom we see a lot more, or perhaps it just seems that way.The BBC narration tells us, not altogether approvingly, thatthe affable Mr. Schwarzenegger is now the biggest ofinternational stars. The star himself discourses interminablyabout his belief system, his techniques, his motivation andplans, in a way that makes one yearn for the old days of thestudio system, when press agents kept a close lid on themouths of their clients.   -- 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E.

Public television's documentary series brings us two newfilms. &quot;A Little Vicious&quot; is likely to leave viewers feelingmore than a little happy about the victories of its subject,Bandit, a Staffordshire terrier given to biting those whomistreat him. Despite this reasonable response, Bandit wasgiven 90 days to have himself rehabilitated or face the deathpenalty. &quot;Where the Heart Roams&quot; is a madly entertainingfrolic about romance novels and their fans. Authors of bookswith titles like &quot;Velvet Promise&quot; and &quot;Savage Ecstasy&quot; tellhow they do it. As successes go, most people will in the endagree that Bandit's is the triumph that matters.   -- 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS.</TEXT></DOC>
