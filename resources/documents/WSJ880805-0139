Petroleum prices fell again yesterday by as much as 50 cents a barrel after five leading oil ministers meeting here Wednesday decided not to call an emergency conference of OPEC to curb surging production. But prices made a partial recovery before the end of the day.    On European spot markets, North Sea Brent crude was trading at about $14.50 a barrel late in the day, down 40 cents. On U.S. futures markets, West Texas Intermediate closed at $15.05 a barrel, down 20 cents.    Nevertheless, the oil ministers left here yesterday generally convinced that calling an emergency session of the 13 OPEC member nations wouldn't have done much to bring oil production under control. They said they expect prices to rise later this year in any event.    &quot;In the next two months, the market will be better than in the last two months,&quot; Belkacem Nabi, Algeria's oil minister, told a news conference.    Mr. Nabi and the four other oil ministers who make up OPEC's so-called Committee of Five -- the price-monitoring panel that has emerged as the cartel's new strategic force -- also left the door open for further steps to prop up sagging oil prices.    &quot;If we need an extraordinary meeting, we will call for an extraordinary meeting,&quot; Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who is president of OPEC and head of the Committee of Five, said in an interview.    What's more, some OPEC delegates suggested that the price-monitoring group itself will reconvene late next month, perhaps in Bali, Indonesia. The idea, they said, would be to plan how to settle various issues between two warring OPEC members, Iraq and Iran, once a cease-fire is established in their nearly eight-year-old conflict.    &quot;OPEC should use the prospects of a cease-fire to establish new harmony among members,&quot; Mr. Nabi said.    Delegates also suggested that such a meeting would review the progress of OPEC's new secretary-general, Subroto, in his efforts to resolve production and other problems. At the Wednesday meeting here, Mr. Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia, was given a mandate for &quot;consultations and negotiations&quot; with OPEC members as well as with other major oil exporters.    Mr. Lukman declined to confirm the reports of yet another meeting of the Committee of Five. &quot;We are not in the business of leaking news to prop up the market temporarily,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
