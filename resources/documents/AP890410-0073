PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet navy has found its nuclear submarine atthe bottom of the frigid Norwegian Sea and believes electricalproblems may have caused a fire and explosions that sank it, anewspaper reported Monday.   The government newspaper Izvestia said rescuers had found thebodies of 19 of the 42 sailors killed when the sub sank north ofNorway on Friday.   Tass, the official news agency, said the 27 survivors werehospitalized in serious condition at Murmansk, a Soviet Arcticport, and investigators were able to interview them for onlyminutes at a time.   It also said a government commission praised the crew for``bravely and intelligently'' working to shut down the sub'snuclear reactor.   ``According to preliminary information, the fire started becauseof a short circuit,'' Izvestia said, quoting navy investigators inMurmansk. It said the submarine carried 10 torpedoes, two of themnuclear-tipped.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov and thenewspaper reiterated previous Soviet statements that there was nodanger of radioactivity being released from the torpedoes or thereactor.   Izvestia said search crews had determined the sub's location butGerasimov said whether it could be raised was not yet known.   ``The question of lifting the submarine up has not been decidedyet,'' he told a news briefing. ``It's a bit deep there.''   Norwegian defense officials in Oslo said the Soviets had asalvage vessel at the site, but spokesman Erik Senstad there was noindication whether an attempt would be made to raise the sub fromnearly 5,000 feet below the surface.   ``We don't even know if the salvage vessel would be capable ofsalvaging anything, Senstad told The Associated Press. ``We areskeptical about the idea that the Soviets are preparing a salvageoperation. The vessels may just have been relatively nearby.''   He said civilian salvers have raised wrecks and parts of wrecksfrom much deeper water, however, and the Soviets presumably wouldwant to retrieve the sub.   Vadim Rozanov, press attache at the embassy in Oslo, said Sovietvessels were in the area to test for radiation, paralleling studiesby Norwegian scientists, but ``I don't know if there are any plansto salvage the submarine.''   If the ship was a Mike-class vessel, as believed in the West, itwould contain some of the most advanced Soviet technology, whichthe Kremlin would not want disclosed to NATO countries, theNorwegian news agency NTB reported.   Norway prepared 10 questions for the Soviets about the sub'sconstruction and reactor safeguards.   ``We are not trying to pry into their military secrets, but weare concerned about other circumstances of safety,'' said SigridRomundset, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.   Among topics addressed were the reactor cooling system, whatradioactive waste they produce and the strength of the protectivecasing around the reactors.   Members of the Committee on Radiation Accidents, created afterthe explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in theSoviet Ukraine in April 1986, drafted the Norwegian questions.   In Denmark, the environmental group Greenpeace said a violentchemical reaciton and explosion might result if the reactors werecooled by fluid sodium and it made contact with sea water.   Izvestia quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov as saying ``thecrew heard several explosions'' after two or three hours of tryingto control the fire.   ``It may be supposed that with the increased pressure on thesub, special devices began to explode,'' he said. ``There were atotal of seven of them on board. It is possible that the body ofthe sub cracked in some places.''   He did not describe the ``special devices.''   Soviet media said previously the fire started in the sub'sseventh section and spread to the sixth, but neither section wasidentified further.   Tass said earlier the submarine's captain, E. Vanin, was amongthe dead. Izvestia said the log was saved and investigators werestudying it.   Four sailors went down with the sub, the paper said, and twopulled from the water died later. It said rescue teams had foundonly 19 bodies and continued searching.   ``Those who were saved are in serious condition,'' Izvestiasaid. ``One was in icy water more than an hour.''   Investigators found no fault with the effort to put out thefire, Tass reported.   ``The sailors fought for the life of the ship until the lastminute, and when the end came they managed to shut down the reactorand guarantee full radioactive safety,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
