DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed amassive enforcement action Wednesday against investment giantDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the head of its junk-bond tradingunit, accusing them of a systematic fraud violations ranging frominsider trading to falsifying books.   The 184-page civil complaint filed in Manhattan federal courtmarked the government's most aggressive move against a securitiesfirm in a two-year-old crackdown on Wall Street corruption stemmingfrom the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.   The complaint alleged ``fraudulent conduct involving insidertrading, stock manipulation, fraud on Drexel's own clients, failureto disclose beneficial ownership of securities and numerous otherviolations.''   The SEC said it would seek to have the defendants give up theprofits made on the affected stock trades and pay a penalty oftriple the profits. The agency offered no specific figure, but Sen.William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, saidthe SEC was seeking $100 million.   Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive officer of Drexel,reiterated the company's position that it would be absolved of thecharges, while Michael Milken, head of Drexel's junk bondoperations, also denied any wrongdoing.   The SEC had said previously that it planned to file a civilcomplaint against Drexel but had not released details of its case.   The SEC's move capped months of speculation that the governmenthad assembled an extensive case against the firm as a result of theinvestigation into Wall Street abuses spawned by the Ivan Boeskyscandal.   According to the complaint, Drexel and Milken, of Encino,Calif., had a ``secret arrangement with Boesky'' involving at least16 series of illegal securities transactions.   Under that agreement, the SEC claimed that Boesky-controlledcompanies secretly bought, sold or held securities for Drexel orother individual defendants and that sometimes Drexel reciprocatedwith secret transactions for Boesky.   The SEC alleged that employees of Drexel and Boesky companieskept secret, off-the-books records of securities positions taken aspart of the arrangement. Boesky was forced nearly two years ago tosurrender a record $100 million in penalties and illegal profitsfrom trading on insider information.   The SEC also charged that Drexel and Milken, in at least twoadditional transactions, traded in securities using confidentialinformation misappropriated from Drexel clients.   Federal law bars corporate executives, investment bankers andothers with access to confidential corporate information from usingit to trade in securities.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, whose office prosecuted Boeskyand other Wall Street criminals, declined to comment on whethercriminal charges would be filed against Drexel, Milken or any ofthe other defendants.   There had been speculation the SEC delayed filing its civilcomplaint to avoid interfering with the criminal investigation.   ``We disagree with the charges filed by the SEC and in duecourse we expect to be vindicated,'' Joseph said in a statement.   He added: ``Hundreds of transactions have been reviewed; yet, asshown by the charges and as we have been predicting, there islittle in the filing that is not based on Ivan Boseky'sallegations.''   In a separate statement, Milken also predicted he would bevindicated in court.   ``For the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadowtrial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon falseaccusations. ... No one likes to be sued, but I welcome theopportunity to have at long last a full and open hearing of theallegations in an unbiased forum,'' he said.   Also included among the defendants were Milken's brother, LowellJ. Milken, of Los Angeles; Cary J. Maultasch of Livingston, N.J.;and Pamela Monzert, Santa Monica, Calif., all Drexel employees.   Also charged were Victor Posner, of Miami Beach, Fla., presidentof Pennsylvania Engineering Corp. of Pittsburgh, which also wasnamed as a defendant, and Posner's son, Stephen Posner, a directorand vice chairman of the board at Pennsylvania Engineering. Aspokeswoman, Renee Mottram, said the Posners had not seen thecomplaint and therefore had no comment. Posner, who was thenation's highest paid corporate executive in the mid-1980s, pleadedguilty earlier this year to federal income tax evasion charges.   Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, said in atelephone interview that the allegations involve 18 series oftransactions, including 16 involving Boesky, the former stockspeculator now in prison.   Boesky was charged with violating insider-trading relatedsecurities laws in November 1986 and settled charges by agreeing toreturn profits and pay fines totaling $100 million.   SEC charges against Drexel, with whom Boesky worked, had beenwidely expected since then.   In mid-July, Frederick W. Joseph, Drexel's chief executive, toldthe firm's employees to expect charges, possibly soon and withlittle warning. Published reports quoted the firm's officials atthe time as saying settlement talks with the SEC had broken down.   Lynch declined to comment regarding efforts to settle thecharges with Drexel or on whether Boesky would be called as awitness.</TEXT></DOC>
