Seventy-five people, including 68 Sri Lankan Tamil mercenaries,were convicted of participating in the Nov. 3, 1988 coup attempt.Sixteen people, four Maldivians and 12 Sri Lankans, were givendeath sentences. The other 59 received prison terms ranging fromnine to 38 years.   The condemned men will be hanged, said Ahmed Saleem, deputydirector of the Maldives Information and Broadcasting Department.   ``Everybody here feels those guilty of this grave crime must beseverely dealt with, there should be no leniency,'' Saleem said bytelephone.   The court found businessman Abdullah Luthufi guilty oforganizing the attempt to overthrow President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.The attempt was crushed by Indian paratroopers after Gayoomrequested help. At least 17 people, mostly local residents, werekilled in the fighting.   The Maldivian government has said the convicted Sri Lankans weremercenaries who were members of a Tamil separatist group.   Chief Justice Moosa Fathy, heading a three-judge panel, read thesentences at a hearing after nearly two months of trial.   No dates were set for the execution.   The court has asked the convicted men to pay $14 million ascompensation for deaths, injuries and property damage, thegovernment statement said.   There is no higher court of appeal in Maldives, a string ofcoral islands in the Indian Ocean. Only President Gayoom cancommute the sentences. The last death sentence in Maldives wascarried out in 1951 by a firing squad.   The Maldives archipelago is about 500 miles southwest of SriLanka and roughly the same distance south of India. The country ismade up of about 2,000 islands, but only about 200 are inhabited.</TEXT></DOC>
