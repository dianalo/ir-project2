This report is the fifth in a seriesproviding summary documentation of studies that subdivide the sectioninto hydrogeologic units based on their judged relative capacities fortransmitting water. This report extends the hydrogeologic study areato the eastern Texas Panhandle, north-central Texas, and southwesternOklahoma. It includes 37 counties in Texas and Oklahoma. Undergroundpatterns of rock distribution are delineated from a hydrologic perspectiveand at a level of detail appropriate for numerical modeling of regionalground-water flow. Hydrogeologic units are defined and characterizedso that appropriate porosity and permeability values can be assignedto each unit during construction of the numerical models (not part ofthis study), and so that modelers can combine units where necessary.In this study, hydrogeologic units have been defined as mappable, physicallycontinuous rock bodies that function in bulk as water-transmitting orwater-retarding units relative to adjacent rocks. Interpretations aremade primarily from geophysical logs. Hydrologic characteristics areassessed on the basis of properties typically associated with certainlithologies (e.g., sandstones are more pervious than shales) and on thebasis of gross variations in effective porosity (particularly in carbonatesequences). 44 refs., 32 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
