With corporations fighting insurers over who must pay to clean up toxic sites, law firms with both environmental practices and insurance practices are having to choose sides.    At least one firm, 160-lawyer Rivkin, Radler, Dunne andamp; Bayh, has decided to make a clean break and to phase out its 10-lawyer environmental law practice to avoid conflicts with its many insurance clients. The phase-out that began last March has already driven four Rivkin Radler environmental law partners out of the firm and into jobs elsewhere.    &quot;We did elect not to represent corporations in Superfund matters because of real and potential conflicts,&quot; said Warren S. Radler of Rivkin Radler, based in Uniondale, N.Y. Two lawyers close to the firm estimated that the Rivkin Radler's insurance clients account for more than 50% of the firm's annual gross revenue.    Lawyers say firms facing such conflicts generally seek to resolve them on a case-by-case basis. But, says Laurie Burt of Bostonbased Foley, Hoag andamp; Eliot, as conflicts mount, the issue becomes more serious.    &quot;It is definitely a potential problem&quot; for law firms with a substantial number of insurance clients, Ms. Burt says.    ---   A LAWYER was penalized for filing a frivolous suit under RICO.    Jack C. Vieley of Peoria, Ill., was slapped with a $64,434 sanction by federal Judge Richard Mills in Springfield, Ill., for filing a meritless complaint under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization law.    Mr. Vieley's RICO complaint alleged that the defendants, who were bank officials, had conspired to forge a letter directing his clients' land trustee to place a second mortgage on a bankrupt tire dealership and service center to secure a debt.    Judge Mills complained that Mr. Vieley's RICO theory was &quot;wacky, sanctionably so&quot; because it failed to allege &quot;predicate acts&quot; and a pattern of racketeering, both necessary to establish a RICO action. Imposing so-called Rule 11 sanctions, Judge Mills ordered Mr. Vieley to pay the opposing side's attorney fees. Mr. Vieley's attorney, W. Thomas Johnston of Peoria, didn't return phone calls.    This is not a case which presented issues in the gray area of the RICO statute,&quot; Judge Mills wrote.    ---   SAKS FIFTH AVENUE AGREED last week to reduce or eliminate fees for certain types of alterations of women's clothing, making the fee structure equal for both sexes. The upscale retailer agreed to the new policy as part of its settlement of a sex discrimination suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The class-action suit was filed last year by two California women who each had been charged $40 for dress alterations at about the same time their husbands had had a suit and a tuxedo altered for free. Saks' policy change became effective Tuesday for the chain's 45 stores nationwide. But the new fee structure is not retroactive, said a spokesman for Saks, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC. This means the plaintiffs were not reimbursed for the alteration charges that inspired the suit, nor were any members of the class action compensated in any way. However, under the terms of the settlement, Saks will pay $24,081 for the plaintiff's attorney fees.    ---   MULTIRACIAL LAW FIRM affiliation is announced in Dallas.    Arter andamp; Hadden, with 250 lawyers, last week announced the formation of an affiliation with two other Dallas firms, four-lawyer Hill Hicks Collins, an African-American firm, and two-lawyer Ronquillo andamp; Castaneda, a Hispanic firm.    Their agreement provides that the firms will serve as co-counsel to selected clients. In addition, the minority firms will share Arter andamp; Hadden's library, conference facilities, support staff and offices in Washington, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.    Arter andamp; Hadden gets more than public relations points out of the deal: Arter andamp; Hadden partner Richard Dean says his firm's immigration law and labor law practices will be enhanced.    &quot;{Marcos} Ronquillo is a national expert on immigration law, and Don Hicks's law firm does contract business with the Dallas school system,&quot; Mr. Dean says.    ---   ROBERT WALLACH leaves RICO forfeiture in hands of judge.    Mr. Wallach, convicted in federal court in New York last week for his role in the Wedtech Corp. influence-peddling scandal, remains free on bail pending his appeal.    As part of the bail arrangement, Mr. Wallach waived his right to have the jury determine his RICO forfeiture. Instead, the RICO penalty will be decided by Judge Richard Owen, who presided over the trial. Mr. Wallach faces a maximum forfeiture of $425,000 plus RICO penalties of $850,000.    The judge plans to announce the forfeiture and RICO penalties Oct. 16, at Mr. Wallach's sentencing. Mr. Wallach, former personal legal adviser to former Attorney General Edwin Meese, faces a maximum of 45 years in jail. In addition to the RICO conviction, he was found guilty of conspiring to defraud the U.S. The convictions stem from payments Mr. Wallach received from Wedtech in return for promising to influence Mr. Meese and other federal officials on behalf of the company. Mr. Wallach maintains that the fees were for consulting services.    Mr. Wallach's co-defendants, W. Franklyn Chinn and R. Kent London, who were each convicted of two RICO counts and other lesser charges, also waived their right to have the jury decide their RICO forfeitures. Both face maximum forfeitures of about $1.2 million, plus penalties of more than $2 million. Under the bail agreement, Mr. Chinn and Mr. London have one month to post additional assets as security, and Mr. London will have to repatriate all foreign property that he owns.    The bail agreement also places certain travel restrictions on the three men.    ---   DAVID ZORNOW, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute Lt. Col. Oliver North and former Bronx Democratic Party boss Stanley Friedman, has joined the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom as a partner. Mr. Zornow will be a member of the firm's litigation practice. He will concentrate on defending individuals and companies in white-collar crime cases. </TEXT></DOC>
