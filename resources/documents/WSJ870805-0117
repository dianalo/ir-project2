IBM's announcement, which was expected, follows by only a day the introduction of two new low-priced personal computers from Tandy, both of which are aimed at Tandy's usual market of home and school users.    The announcement also follows IBM's failure with its low-end PCjr computer two years ago and a declaration by IBM's chairman, John F. Akers, early last summer that IBM might abandon certain segments of the personal computer market if the business became &quot;conclusively commodity-like.&quot;    But the education computer business, especially in the kindergarten through high school market, is frenetically price-competitive with manufacturers typically offering school systems sharp discounts and even free machines. &quot;They want this market very badly,&quot; said Seymour Merrin, a Southport, Conn., consultant. &quot;It's not a marketplace that IBM has the kind of loyalty that they have in other markets.&quot;    Meanwhile, IBM also announced a more powerful version of its top-of-the-line Personal Systems/2 computers, which were introduced last April.    IBM's latest foray into the education market, however, was the focus of IBM's presentation yesterday. IBM's basic model 25, based on Intel Corp.'s 8086 chip, has 512 kilobytes of addressable memory, or about 250 double-spaced typewritten pages, and a 3 1/2-inch disk drive that stores 720 kilobytes of memory. The machine, with a built-in color monitor, is priced at $1,695, while the model with a monochrome monitor sells for $1,350.    But no one, not even IBM, claims the list price will hold. &quot;We intend to discount aggressively,&quot; said an IBM spokesman, adding the company plans, for example, to offer educational institutions the model 25 with a color monitor for as little as $1,017, or a 40% discount.    IBM officials hope the combination of price and features, such as enhanced graphics, will boost IBM's unit share of the education market, which is estimated at 7% by Anne Wujcik, a program director with Talmis, a New York market research concern. Apple and Tandy account for 58% and 17% of the market, respectively, she said.    Although the machine is also targeted to the home user and small businesses, the education market offers IBM a chance to build revenue in an area that is still far from saturated. Ms. Wujcik said there is only one computer for every 30 public school students now; teachers would like to have one computer for every five students. The education market also offers IBM the chance to groom future customers, said Ned C. Lautenbach, president of IBM's National Distribution Division. &quot;People, from our vantage point, who learn on a (particular) machine, go on to use that machine.&quot;    Industry officials generally praised IBM's new computer and were relieved the company doesn't appear, on the surface, to be about to repeat its PCjr debacle. The PCjr was dropped by IBM in early 1985, plagued by such problems as a limited memory and a toy-like keyboard. &quot;It looks like it's well designed. It's not a PCjr by any means,&quot; said Frank L. Bryant, president of Neeco Inc., a Canton, Mass., computer chain.    While IBM officials and analysts said the company has had some success with its model 30 machine in the education market -- until now the low end of IBM's new PS/2 line -- the company faces stiff competition from both Tandy and Apple. &quot;Relative to what Tandy introduced, it's very high priced,&quot; said Michele Preston, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst.    Tandy's model 1000 TX computer with a color monitor is priced 13% less than IBM's basic model 25. The Tandy machine, which is based on Intel's more powerful 80286 chip, has 640 kilobytes of memory, compared with 512 kilobytes for the IBM machine.    &quot;We're very pleased,&quot; said Ed Juge, Tandy's market planning director, who concedes IBM holds the edge when it comes to graphics. &quot;They were a day late and a dollar short.&quot;    An Apple spokeswoman, meanwhile, contended that IBM's new products wouldn't directly compete with Apple's products, primarily because Apple has its own operating system while the IBM machines utilize Microsoft's DOS system.    IBM also unveiled the most powerful model in its new Personal System/2 product line. The model 80-311 is the fourth of its top-of-the-line floor models that are based on Intel's 80386 chip. The machine, which will be available early next year, can address as many as four megabytes of memory, or 2,000 typed pages, and store more than 332,000 typewritten pages of information. Priced at $13,995, the new model is aimed at users who require huge amounts of memory, such as design engineers, or businesses that would use is it as a hub for workstations.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, IBM's stock closed at $159.375 a share, up 12.5 cents, while Tandy finished at $46.375 a share, up 12.5 cents. Apple closed in national over-the-counter trading at $42.25 a share, up $2. </TEXT></DOC>
