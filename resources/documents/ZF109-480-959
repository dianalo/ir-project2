 If ever a growing marketplacedeserved such a description, then it surely applies to the wide areanetworking industry.andP;  With internetworking products expected to account foralmost 75 percent of overall networking sales by 1993, the rapid expansion inthe number of installed WANs will help continue the already-boomingnetworking industry's growth.andM;As organizations begin installing these ever-bigger WANs, they're doing itwith equipment better equipped to handle the accelerating demands placed onthem.andP;  These include multiprotocol routers, routers that also bridge, anddata-compression devices that are increasing LAN-to-LAN throughputsubstantially.andM;The best is yet to come, however.andP;  Increasingly ultra-high-speed transmissionservices and interfaces--offering data-exchange rates ranging from 44.5Mbpsup to an incredible 2.5Gbps--are now beginning to emerge as viablealternatives to the sticky problem of moving huge masses of digitized datafrom point A to a distant point B.andM;T-1 transmission services, at 1.54Mbps, may seem more than adequate for mostinternetwork data exchanges right now, especially when compared to the19.6Kbps rates offered by the high-speed modems found in manystore-and-forward environments.andP;  When matched against the next-generationdigital data-communications services and protocols on the horizon, however,T-1 pales.andM;Gigabit Data RatesandM;Consider the rates available with T-3, at 44.5Mbps, and Synchronous OpticalNetwork (SONET), with low- and high-end rates of 51.85Mbps to 2.5Gbps,respectively.andP;  Then throw in an alphabet-soup listing of emergingprotocols--broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), AsynchronousTransmission Mode (ATM), frame relay, and Switched Multimegabit Data Service(SMDS)--and the interconnectivity choices send one's mind whirling.andM;And this list doesn't include Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)products, which can exchange data at 100Mbps; FDDI is used more in backboneor metropolitan area networks (MAN) than WAN environments, but with a10-kilometer distance limit, it too is often included as part of a WANsolution.andM;&quot;Even though the computer communications technology is very good [now],&quot; saysScott Perry, vice president of ATandamp;T's Computer Systems networking division,&quot;We're talking about several orders of magnitude more data coming down theline&quot; with these new technologies.andM;What They AreandM;Let's take a quick look at what these technologies are and how they do whatthey do.andP;  The T-3 and SONET transmission schemes operate at the physicallayer in the International Standards Organization's (ISO's) Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI) seven-layer reference model.andP;  That is, T-3 and SONETare responsible for placing data on the network media.andP;  The specificationsfor each scheme spell out the types of media, the data-transmission rates,framing, and packet sizes and format to which interfaces must adhere whenconnecting to the appropriate network.andM;Although T-3 signals can be sent over copper wire, more typically theyrequire the bandwidth provided by fiber-optic cable; SONET, as its name(Synchronous Optical Network) implies, is an all-fiber technology.andM;ATM is a low-level protocol that Sun Microsystems's WAN product manager NoelLindsey calls a &quot;fundamentally&quot; new architecture.andP;  ATM combines theadvantages of circuit-switching networks with those of packet-switchednetworks.andP;  Circuit-switched networks give users the entire network bandwidth;packet-switched networks allow sharing the bandwidth--individual user's datapackets are dispersed among other users' packets.andM;ATM is being developed and promoted by Belcore, the Regional Bell OperatingCompanies' (RBOCs) equivalent to Bell Labs.andP;  Because ATM operatesindependently of the physical layer, it can be run over copper wire (i.e.,andO;T-3) as well as fiber; however, at its higher data rates--it ranges fromabout 50Mbps to 2.5Gbps--ATM service providers would probably be forced touse SONET-standard fiber lines.andM;A Faster X.25andM;ATM is a packet-switched service similar to X.25, but it operates faster thanX.25.andP;  Due to faster switching speeds and lower latency, or the delayassociated with data packets passing through multiple network hops, a delayoccurs each time a data packet is retransmitted through a network router orbridge.andP;  The longer the delay, the greater the latency and the lower the datathroughput rate.andM;ATM derives its latency advantages by transmitting very small (128K),precisely structured data packets, called cells, over short internetworkhops.andP;  These cells are routed by dedicated hardware platforms thatsignificantly outperform the software routing facilities that control X.25packet routing, according to Sun's Lindsey.andP;  This hardware can operate athigh data rates because it is designed specifically to recognize and passATM's cells, which are precisely structured and thus easily handled by therouting devices.andM;Both SMDS and broadband ISDN can run on top of ATM, according to Lindsey, whofeels SMDS &quot;is probably going to be fairly temporary.andP;  It will be preemptedby broadband ISDN.andP;  Broadband ISDN will provide the same kinds of accesscapabilities as SMDS, but it also allows reserving network capacity to linkone point with another and move data in a isochronous manner.&quot;andM;According to Lindsey, isochronous schemes move data in a predictable manner.andO;That means there's a predetermined interval between each data packet.andO;Contrast this with X.25, a store-and-forward scheme that transmits packets inan unpredictable fashion; that is, with variable-sized packets separated byvariable delays.andM;Predictable delivery is vital when transmitting digitized voice and videodata.andP;  Imagine trying to make sense of a phone conversation in which theother person's words were broken into syllables.andP;  If the last syllable of aword reached your ears several seconds after the first one, as could occurusing store-and-forward transmission of a conversation, the word would not beunderstandable.andM;This capability allows portions of broadband ISDN networks to be reserved forvoice, data, or image.andP;  &quot;To send video from me to you,&quot; explains Lindsey, &quot;myworkstation can request 10Mbps, and ISDN reserves the channels.&quot;andM;Because broadband ISDN allows all or part of its bandwidth to be reserved forspecific applications, users can determine how they want to break up thebandwidth.andP;  For example, they can decide whether they want to run one or twohigh-resolution video channels--taking up 10Mbps--or multiplelower-resolution channels--utilizing perhaps only 500Kb of bandwidth.andM;Who Needs It?andM;Who needs these high-speed data highways?andP;  Plenty of people.andM;For instance, those migrating to distributed computing or client-serverenvironments could use it.andP;  And users of graphics-intensive applications.andO;Power users running graphics and 3-D applications on RISC-based workstationsfrom the likes of Sun Microsystems will discover that operating over thesehigh-speed technologies is mandatory, not optional.andM;Large corporations that insist on maintaining disaster-proof, fault-tolerantnetworks will need these high-speed data highways.andP;  These companies couldn'teven begin to conceive of operating fully mirrored networks hundreds of milesapart without the bandwidth delivered by T-3 services today and, in thefuture, SONET.andM;In fact, &quot;The biggest application for high-speed networks is disasterrecovery,&quot; says Don Spalinger, a vice president at T3Plus, a Santa Clara,Calif., vendor of products that allow connecting local networks to T-3transmission services.andP;  Other applications driving the market for super-highdata rates are distributed databases, image processing, and the growingprevalence of graphical user interfaces.andM;All of these applications send huge volumes of data down the network media.andO;&quot;The next obvious step is T-3,&quot; says Doug Tsui, manager of product marketinga cisco Systems (Menlo Park, Calif.), a vendor of multi-protocol routersrequired for these high-speed WAN connections.andP;  &quot;Another option isframe-relay, the next generation packet-switched network.&quot;andM;Take a disaster-recovery, or LAN-to-LAN &quot;mirroring&quot; application as anexample.andP;  In a typical fault-tolerant environment over WAN links, the primaryLAN in one region-- say San Francisco--would be exactly duplicated at anothercity--perhaps in Los Angeles.andP;  Like in file server mirroring arrangements,the two local networks are maintained as identical mirror images of eachother.andP;  All data stored on the one in San Francisco would also be storedautomatically on the second LAN.andP;  Then if a catastrophic crisis knocks outone network, the other remains safe and, just as importantly, up to date.andM;Just how far apart the two networks need to be depends on a number offactors, including regional and local environment, and operationalparameters.andM;For instance, in California, where earthquakes affect large areas, it wouldbe wise to place mirrored networks at least 100 miles away from each other;in New York City, where an electrical power blackout is more of a threat thanan earthquake, the backup LAN could be only several miles away from theprimary network if it were in another power company's distribution area.andM;&quot;An obvious example is [Northern California's Oct. 17, 1989] earthquake,&quot;notes Spallinger.andP;  &quot;Companies in San Francisco that had mirrored or redundantfailsafe networks somewhere else could have continued to work even when theSan Francisco network was down.&quot;andM;Real-Time RedundancyandM;Maintaining real-time redundancy requires extremely high-speed links betweenthe mirrored networks; that's where T-3 and, in the near future, SONET,transmission data rates are required.andP;  In these types of environments, thenetwork servers typically are mainframes, with a front-end processor actingas a communications server, or gateway, to the LAN.andP;  The mainframes would belinked to each other via bridges our routers and a dedicated T-3 or SONETline.andP;  This combination links the two physically separated LANs into asingle, logical high-speed network.andM;&quot;Corporations are doing a lot more of this as they become aware that criticalnetwork failures can shut them down for a substantial amount of time,&quot;explains Spalinger.andP;  &quot;In 1989, there were probably fewer than 200organizations doing this type of high-speed WAN, but we anticipate that thenumber will more than double this year and be more than 1,000 next year.&quot;andM;Distributing the LoadandM;Where high-speed LAN-to-LAN communications links really promise to improvenetwork performance and win user acceptance--and, not coincidentally,management's approval to pay for more sophisticated and expensive equipmentand communications lines--is in distributed computing environments.andM;&quot;As you put in more and more distributed applications, you're just going todrag down the response time on everybody if you don't get into the higherspeeds,&quot; says T3Plus's Spalinger.andP;  &quot;A lot of the data on a network ischanging from alphanumeric ASCII to visual and graphics data, and thisrequires tremendously greater bandwidth.&quot;andM;&quot;The distributed processing model is really going to offer significantadvantages,&quot; with high-speed links between specialized servers and theirclients mandatory, agrees Sun's Noel Lindsey.andM;Lindsey's concept of a distributed processing environment isn't limited tohigh-speed links, though.andP;  He also includes more traditional connectivityoptions, such as 56Kbps leased lines, X.25 packet-switching networks, directpoint-to-point lines, and T-1 links.andP;  Lindsey says the application shoulddrive the level of transmission service used, and designers of distributedprograms should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each type oftransmission service.andM;&quot;The real driving force behind distributed applications should be to putwhatever processes you want where they can be used most effectively,&quot; hesays, &quot;and then move only the data you need.andM;&quot;I define a [distributed] application not as a software package, but as asolution to a problem,&quot; says Lindsey, &quot;and that application may involve fivedifferent programs interacting on five difference machines all interacting ona network.andM;&quot;A lot of people think designing distributed applications is difficult;what's really hard is taking an existing application and distributing it,&quot;Lindsey continues.andP;  &quot;And without rethinking the architecture of theapplication, you won't get any desirable out of it.andM;&quot;The best way to think is&quot; 'How do I best solve the application or problem,'and do it in a way that makes the most sense.andP;  If you have a system thatworks, nothing says you can't take that and use it as a guideline fordistributed application.andP;  Then, designing the distributed application islimited only by your imagination and a knowledge of what you're trying todo.&quot;andM;Choosing the LinkandM;Here are some factors that Lindsey believes designers of distributedapplications should take into consideration when choosing telecommunicationslinks for these applications:andM;* Dedicated T-1 and, in the future, T-3 and SONET, lines should most often bereserved for point-to-point applications requiring continuous, high-bit-ratecommunication.andM;* X.25 networks are ideal for what might be called bursty traffic; forinstance, X.25 services are ideal for inexpensively linking a network offield offices to corporate headquarters.andP;  Depending on the volume of data tobe transferred, both T-1 and 56Kbps lines can be used to tap into X.25clouds.andM;* In addition to serving as links to X.25, dedicated 56Kbps lines operateefficiently in point-to-point environments that require small amounts ofcontinuous data flow.andP;  For example, an e-mail network may be run efficientlyover 56Kbps lines.andM;Users who transfer large database files created with computer-aideddesign/engineering (CAD/CAE) programs will require T-1 and above.andP;  Designingintegrated circuits with a Unix-based workstation, for example, builds hugedatabases that describe the parameters of the chip.andP;  Integrated circuitdesign companies often move these databases from one workstation to another,and the network must be accommodate such data shipments.andP;  For instance, adatabase may be transferred from the original designer's workstation to asecond machine that verifies the correctness of the design to a thirdworkstation that actually draws the design on a plotter.andM;If these stations are all in one building, then an FDDI ring would probablybe required to move the database files around.andP;  But with workstations thatare likely to be several miles apart, high-bandwidth transmission facilitiesare required.andM;Imaging IncreasesandM;The increased use of graphics, particularly 3-D imaging, is the other mainforce behind the slow migration to the higher-speed data-transport servicesand products.andP;  &quot;Image applications will have a dramatic impact&quot; on the T-3and above market, says ATandamp;T's Scott Perry.andM;&quot;A lot of people are moving images around, and these are huge data sets,&quot;says Sun's Lindsey.andP;  &quot;We're looking at something that easily requires moving20MB to 100MB in one image; 10MB to 15MB for more demanding applications.andO;Some programs, such as those using real-time animation, try to update images10 to 20 times a second, and you can't do that with T-1.andM;&quot;When you talk about moving images, we've just seen the tip of the icebergM&quot;Lindsey adds.andP;  &quot;We'll see a tremendous increase in the demand for movinglarge amounts of graphics information, both in size and number of images theywant to move.&quot;andM;For instance, many graphics-intensive applications, such as those using 3-Dor animation techniques, on RISC workstations transfer data at 1.5Mbps.andP;  Thistranslates to about 12Mbps, says T3Plus's Don Spalinger.andP;  And it's possibleto overload an Ethernet with just three Sun workstations running some ofthese applictions, he says.andM;Of course, leased T-1, T-3, and eventually SONET lines and their associatedproducts don't come cheap.andP;  T-1 lines, for example, cost thousands of dollarsa month, and T-3 runs three to ten times more than T-1, says Spalinger.andO;&quot;Depending on the distance, a T-3 line can cost tens of thousands of dollarsa month,&quot; he says.andM;Users can eventually expect competitive access to T-3 transmissionfacilities, according to cisco's Tsui.andP;  Providing T-3 transmission servicesis one area that RBOCs &quot;don't want to miss the boat on.andP;  They don't want tomiss out on the T-3 bulk rates.andP;  They're talking about offering thehigher-speed data services such as SMDS.&quot;andM;Creating a Mesh NetandM;The critical ingredient in deploying X.25 networks, says Lindsey, is thateveryone on this mesh network can communicate with anyone else at arelatively low cost.andP;  Users of X.25 networks pay on a per-packet basis, withthe costs independent of the distance a packet travels.andP;  For example, usingX.25, it will cost the same amount to send a message from Chicago to New YorkCity as it does to send the same data from Chicago to Hong Kong.andM;&quot;The key idea is that you're not paying for a leased line to Bangkok,&quot; orwherever a company has field offices, Lindsey explains.andP;  When field officereps need information from the corporate database, for example, they merelylog onto their local network and make their inquiries, which are then routedby the local network through a gateway to an X.25 network such as Telenet orTymnet.andP;  The X.25 service then routes the data to the LAN at headquarters,where the inquiry is processed.andP;  The results are sent back in reverse order.andM;Who's Building WhatandM;A few small companies are at the leading edge in providing the connectivityproducts to use these high-speed technologies.andP;  cisco Systems, founded in1987, is arguably a leader in this arena.andP;  Its AGS+ router supportsconnections to FDDI, T-1, X.25, ISDN, and X.35 (high-speed modem) WANs andcan be migrated to T-3.andP;  ATandamp;T is one of cisco's major OEM customers for thisproduct, which can support 533Mbps transmission rates.andM;cisco's AGS+ utilizes asymmetrical multiprocessing, which combines a RISCprocessor with a Motorola 68000 CPU.andP;  The RISC chip was designed specificallyto handle internetwork switching and routing, according to Tsui.andP;  &quot;Aconventional, off-the-shelf CPU can't match&quot; the kinds of switching speedscisco's specialized RISC chip can handle, contends Tsui.andM;ATandamp;T went with cisco's router because its strategy is &quot;to go outside to thebest in the market&quot; for its internetwork products, says Phil Galli, anetworking marketing manager for ATandamp;T.andP;  &quot;There's much more we want to do withthat [router],&quot; he adds.andM;Other vendors providing interfaces to T-3 services include Network Systems(Minneapolis, Minn.), T3Plus, and NEtwork Equipment Technology (Redwood City,Calif.).andP;  Most T-1 interface vendors may move into the high-end products inthe next few years.andM;Merging Routers and HubsandM;One other WAN-oriented development worth noting: the incorporation of routertechnology into 10BaseT Ethernet wiring concentrators.andP;  Incorporating routersinto hubs also saves considerable expense.andP;  Network managers don't have topay for a dedicated router as well as wiring concentrators.andP;  Plus, it savesspace in wiring closets.andM;cisco Systems is working with three vendors of 10BaseT Ethernet wiringconcentrators--specifically, SynOptics (Mountain View, Calif.), Chipcom(Southborough, Mass.) and Cabletron (Rochester, N.H.)--to put its routingtechnology into multiport hubs.andM;cisco's agreements with the three concentrator vendors call for the tworespective vendors to codevelop modular versions of cisco's multiprotocolrouter.andM;In each case, this router module will be integrated into the various vendors'wiring concentrator--Chipcom's Online System Concentrator, SynOptics'LattisNet System 3000 wiring center, and Cabletron's Multi-Media AccessCenter (MMAC).andM;Centralized wiring concentrators that are also capable of internetworkrouting promise to give network managers increased centralized control ofEthernet networks.andM;This not only improves physical control, with both hub and router in onelocation, but also enhances overall network control.andP;  In particular, bothSynOptics' LattisNet and Cabletron's MMAC support the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP), which can give network managers a wealth ofinformation about the operational parameters of network components.andM;These router modules will be available by the end of the year, according tothe four companies.andP;  Chipcom will sell its module as an option to its OnlineSystem Concentrator, while cisco will market and support the router modulefor Cabletron's MMAC.andP;  SynOptics has not released distribution arrangementsfor its LattisNet router module, and the companies have not as yet announcedprices for any of these products.andM;Your High-Speed WAN Transmission OptionsandM;As the internetworking marketplace expands, so too are the high-speedcommunications options available to network planners.andP;  Here's a look at theexisting and emerging options for high-speed data transfer across widedistances.andM;Available NowandM;* T-1: 1.54Mbps packet-switched data rate (bandwidth).andP;  The T-1 bandwidth isoften broken down into multiple circuits, typically of 64Kbps switched or54Kbps channelized (multiple channels) or nonchannelized (uses fullbandwidth); services provided by various communications vendors, includingthe Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs).andM;* FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface): 100Mbps fiber-optic datatransmission system.andP;  Although not truly a WAN technology--the ANSI FDDIstandard says nodes should be no farther than 2-1/2 kilometers apart--FDDI isused in enterprisewide and metropolitan networks.andP;  It is based on atoken-passing ring transmission scheme similar to IBM's Token Ring; one majordifference is the FDDI standard calls for a dual-ring topology, whereas TokenRing uses just one ring that provides built-in fault-tolerance capabilities.andO;FDDI services are generally developed privately, with endusers installingfiber-optic cabling within and/or between their facilities.andP;  FDDI LANs can beinterconnected to T-1 and T-3 lines to extend high-speed connectivity to theWAN environment.andM;Emerging TechnologiesandM;* T-3: 44.21Mbps packet-switched data rate.andP;  When used in voicecommunications, T-3 lines are comprised of 28 multiplexed T-1 circuits; whenused in data transmission, the entire 44.21Mbps bandwidth can be madeavailable for clear channel access.andP;  Transmission services can be leased fromthe telephone operating companies (i.e., RBOCs).andM;* Frame relay: 1.544Mbps &quot;fast packet&quot; packet-switching system.andP;  The emergingIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) standard allows allocating abackbone system's full bandwidth (up to 1.54Mbps) to applications as neededinstead of allocating specific channels to specific applications.andP;  Availablefrom vendors such as Northern Telecom.andM;* SMDS: Acronym for &quot;switched megabit data service.&quot;andP;  Describes a high-speed,packet-switched data-transmission scheme.andM;* SONET (Synchronous Optical Network): An emerging, and currently barelyimplemented, standard for high-speed fiber data-transmission systems.andO;Various levels of SONET will offer data rates from 51.85Mbps to 2.5Gbps.andM;Digital Signal communications TerminologyandM;Administrators of local area networks find they must learn an entirely newset of terms and acronyms when they begin expanding their LANs into the widearea arena.andP;  Here are some of those you're likely to come across.andM;DACS--Acronym for &quot;digital access and crossconnect system.&quot;andP;  DACS are used inmesh network applications that require switching and grooming routingcapabilities to deliver signals to specific network nodes.andM;DS0--Stands for &quot;digital signal 0.&quot;andP;  Refers to a 64Kbps channel for digitizedvoice transmission.andM;DS1/2/3/4--Stands for &quot;digital signal 1/2/3/4.&quot;andP;  The DS1/2/3/4 digital signalhierarchy describes the protocols, framing format, and frequency that variouslevels of transmission products use; DS1 refers to T-1 data transmission(1.54Mbps), DS3 to T-3 facilities (44.210Mbps).andP;  DS2 and DS4 are seldom-usedstandards that exchange data at 6.312Mbps and 274.176Mbps, respectively.andM;DSX1/3--STands for &quot;digital signal crossconnect&quot; at level 1 or 3.andP;  Describesthe electrical and physical interfaces to interconnect DS1 (T-1) and DS3(T-3) signals.andM;DSU--Acronym for &quot;data service unit.&quot;andP;  Provides clear-channel across (i.e.,andO;use of the entire bandwidth) to T-3 transmission facilities.andM;M13--The format used to multiplex 28 DS1 (T-1) circuits into a DS3 (T-3)circuit.andM;SMDS--Acronym for &quot;switched megabit data service.&quot;andP;  Describes a high-speed,packet-switched, data-transmission scheme.andM;SONET--Acronym for &quot;synchronous optical network.&quot;andP;  Describes a high-speed,fiber-optical transmission system with data rates from 51.84Mbps to2,488.32Mbps.andM;T-1/T-3--Transmission facility using DS1 and DS3 signals, respectively.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
