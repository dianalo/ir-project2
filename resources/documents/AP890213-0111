The council, the West African nation's highest ruling body, hasbeen reduced from 29 to 18 members, with several Cabinet ministersand the chief of state security dropped. Unlike the former council,which had two civilian members, the new one has military membersonly.   Babangida's decision last week to disband the council had caughtthe nation by surprise, and provoked rumors of discord within themilitary and speculation about coup attempts.   Col. Fred Chijua, chief spokesman for the Nigerian army, deniedin an interview with the African Guardian news magazine that therehad been any attempt against Babangida's government or that anymilitary personnel had been executed.   Babangida, an army general, set up the original council afterseizing power in a barracks' coup in 1985. The council is to presideover the country's return to civil rule in 1992.   In recent months, there have been growing complaints about therising cost of living in Africa's most populous nation, and laborunions have threatened nationwide strikes to protestgovernment-ordered cuts in fringe benefits and salaries.   The military government has imposed an austerity plan to try toget out of a deep recession partly caused by lower oil prices.Nigeria's main export earnings come from petroleum exports.</TEXT></DOC>
