Free boundary modes with m = 1 and ksub(z)-andgt; O are shown to be unstable for all pressure profiles which go to zeroat the plasma surface, if feedback from the wall can be neglected. Thegrowth rate of the instability increases with decreasing plasma radius.Similar results are found for Extrap. Nonlinearities in combination withlosses at the X-points are possibly responsible for the gross stabilityof free boundary modes in some Extrap discharges. In recent Extrap experiments,where an axial field (Bsub(T) = 0.5 Bsub(p)) is added, the improved stabilitymight instead be due to passive feedback.</TEXT></DOC>
