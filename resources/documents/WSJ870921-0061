The 70-year-old Mr. Ford, who is in the intensive care unit of Henry Ford Hospital with pneumonia, was visited Friday morning by a Florida priest who was in Detroit to attend a wedding. The wedding was of the youngest daughter of Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, who became Mr. Ford's bitter archrival after he was fired as Ford Motor Co.'s president in 1978.    The trouble was, the priest -- Fr. John Mericantante, an associate pastor of Immaculate Conception parish in Hialeah, Fla. -- wasn't supposed to be in Mr. Ford's room. And just why he went was something of a mystery that Fr. Mericantante apparently wasn't helping to solve.    Fr. Mericantante, who couldn't be reached for comment, was quoted in Detroit newspapers over the weekend as saying both that he:    --decided on his own to make the visit, because his father had worked for Ford Motor, and simply walked into Mr. Ford's room without authorization.    --made the visit at the request of an unnamed member of &quot;the family.&quot;    But no member of Mr. Ford's family invited Fr. Mericantante, says Jerry L. Sloan, director of external communications for Ford Motor. Mr. Sloan says that when he tracked down Fr. Mericantante, the priest explained that he had meant &quot;a member of the Iacocca family.&quot;    Chrysler, however, was quick to assert that the Iacoccas had nothing to do with Fr. Mericantante's visit -- even though the priest was taken to the hospital in a Chrysler limousine driven by a Chrysler chauffer, both put at his disposal by Mr. Iacocca. James Tolley, Chrysler's vice president for public affairs, says he phoned David W. Scott, Ford's vice president for public affairs, &quot;to assure him that neither Mr. Iacocca nor any member of his family nor Chrysler was involved in this.&quot; Mr. Scott says he believes that, and adds: &quot;I don't think Mr. Iacocca would authorize a bizarre thing like this.&quot;    Another mystery is just what Fr. Mericantante did at Mr. Ford's bedside. Weekend Detroit newspapers said the priest -- who Mr. Tolley says is &quot;an acquaintance of the Iacocca family&quot; -- claimed he administered the Catholic Church's Sacrament of the Sick, also known as the last rites.    But Mr. Sloan, the Ford spokesman, says Fr. Mericantante was in the room only briefly before a doctor walked in, asked him who he was, and immediately ushered him out. &quot;No one saw him (administer the sacrament),&quot; Mr. Sloan says. &quot;He was only in there a second or two.&quot;    Mr. Ford converted to Roman Catholicism when he married his first wife, Anne McDonnell Ford, in 1940. He was divorced in 1965 and married twice again.    The Ford family was &quot;upset&quot; at the incident, Mr. Sloan says, and especially at the idea that a stranger could just walk into Mr. Ford's room. A spokesman at Henry Ford Hospital -- which was founded by the first Henry Ford, grandfather of Henry Ford II -- said that a guard has been posted outside the room after the visit.    Mr. Ford's physician, Bruce Steinhauer, issued a statement yesterday saying that Mr. Ford acquired an ailment called &quot;organizing pneumonia,&quot; which is an inflammation of the lungs, while traveling in Europe recently.    Mr. Ford was admitted to Cottage Hospital near his home in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., on Sept. 7, and transferred to Henry Ford Hospital on Sept. 11. &quot;We continue to administer antibiotics,&quot; Dr. Steinhauer said.    &quot;It was an unfortunate incident,&quot; says Patricia McCarthy, the hospital's director of public relations. She says that Fr. Mericantante apparently wasn't noticed by staffers before he entered the room because &quot;it isn't unusual&quot; for clergymen to be in the hospital. </TEXT></DOC>
