<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0383 </DOCNO><TEXT>Application specific integrated circuits can dramatically reduce the numberof chips required to implement logic functions on printed circuit boards.Reductions of chip counts of more than 70 to 1 can be achieved. Thisreduces the complexity of the printed circuit board, manufacturing costs,stock costs, printed circuit board size and often results in improvedperformance. For PV applications a reduction in chip count can resultin a reduction in power demand. In particular, this could apply to lowpowered PV consumer products, or in the case of PV systems, in a reductionin the no-load demand of power conditioning equipment. Possible applicationsof ASICs to PV are examined and an ASIC designed to control the batterycharging in a PV system is described. 2 figs., 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
