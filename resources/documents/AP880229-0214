(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials of the Assemblies of God metMonday to discuss the future of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, whostepped down from his pulpit amid allegations of immoral conduct.   A police officer guarded the parking lot of the Assemblies'state headquarters, and officials issued a statement saying thedenomination would have no comment.   ``Decisions made by the Louisiana district presbytery today willbe returned to the executive presbytery. There will be no furtherannouncement or comment from the Louisiana district counsel,''district superintendent Cecil Janway said in the statement.   There was no indication Swaggart, who confessed a week ago tocommitting a sin, was present.   The meeting broke up at 7 p.m. Seen leaving the office buildingwere the Rev. Jim Rentz, who is substituting for Swaggart at theFamily Worship Center in Baton Rouge, and Forrest Hall,secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies of God Louisiana districtcouncil.   Rentz had no comment, but Hall acknowledged that the meeting hadended and that executive officials from Springfield, Mo., where thechurch is based, had attended at the meeting.   Leaders of the Pentecostal denomination are considering arehabilitation plan that will suspend Swaggart from preaching,reportedly because he paid a prostitute to pose naked and tried tomake a deal with a minister who confronted him about it.   Last week, Louisiana church officials recommended barringSwaggart from preaching for three months, but national denominationofficials asked for reconsideration after receiving hundreds ofcalls protesting the penalty as too lenient.   The state denomination also was criticized for publicizing itsrecommendation before it was reviewed by the national office.   During a brief appearance Sunday at the Jimmy Swaggart WorldMinistries center, Swaggart thanked about 4,000 worshipers fortheir backing.   ``I'll never have the words to express to you how much that Icare, my concern, for you and my thanksgiving. If it hadn't beenfor you, we would not have made it. It's just that plain andsimple,'' said Swaggart.   Swaggart again was not specific about his wrongdoing, but saidhe had received support and sympathy from members of variousdenominations.   The founder of an evangelical empire worth an estimated $150million said his worldwide ministry would continue.   ``First of all, this ministry belongs to God. Secondly, thisministry will continue. And last, but certainly not least, thisministry will be what He wants it to be,'' Swaggart said.   Marvin Gorman, the defrocked Assemblies of God minister whoreportedly confronted Swaggart with photographs of him entering andleaving a New Orleans motel room with a prostitute, asked his owncongregation Sunday for prayers for Swaggart.   ``I want you all to pray for Jimmy Swaggart and his familybecause we know that they're going through a lot right now. And Iwant you to know that I know that a lot of miracles will come outof this,'' Gorman, who now preaches independently, said at hisMetropolitan Christian Centre in New Orleans.   In a $90 million lawsuit filed last year, Gorman alleged thatSwaggart and 13 others had destroyed his ministry by spreadingfalse rumors of adulterous affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
