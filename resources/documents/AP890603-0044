Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, the president of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said officialsdiscussed ``the whole agenda'' during private talks Friday. Hewould not elaborate.   The ministers of the 13-nation group were meeting privatelytoday to try to work out a production agreement for the last halfof the year. Their formal strategy session begins Monday.   Most ministers appear unwilling to adopt tactics that couldupset what has been a surprisingly strong market so far this year.   Indeed, some officials say the ministers may decide to roll overthe current agreement for another six months.   In November, the ministers agreed to curb their production andset a cap of 18.5 million barrels a day. They settled on abenchmark price of $18 a barrel.   Since then, the average price of a basket of crudes monitored byOPEC has shot up, rising more than 40 percent to nearly $17.70 abarrel.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, has beentrading around $20 a barrel.   Prices have been pushed up not only by OPEC's output cuts butalso by accidents in oil-producing areas. They have combined totrim the supply of oil on the world market.   In their bargaining, the ministers will discuss whether tomaintain their output cap, or lift it to 19.5 million or 20 millionbarrels a day, as several countries have requested.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
