The 5 key invariably had a little pimple on its key top; this wasthe home key to encourage touch typing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE KEY MAN'S DECISION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WEST LETTERS  </MEMO><TEXT>     The electronic calculator didn't reach the market until the late '60s. In1971, Commodore Business Machines was, to the best of my recollection, thefirst company to bring to market a low-cost ($199.95) electronic calculatorwhich we envisioned as a consumer product.;    We -- Jack Tramiel, the chiefexecutive officer, and I, as marketing vice president -- debated long andhard: Do we follow the tradition of the adding machine or should weacknowledge the configuration of the relatively new telephone keyboard? At thetime, I felt that the phone keyboard was more logical and should set thestandard for calculator keyboards. Tramiel, with his extensive background inthe office machine business and with his clout as CEO, prevailed: We wouldfollow adding machine tradition.;    I can't help feeling that Jack Tramielmay very well have been the moving force for this keyboard dichotomy. But I'msure he meant well.;    Sam Bernstein; Santa Clara; West Letters, WestMagazine, 750 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, CA 95190.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910428  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  244  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 28, 199100119034,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
