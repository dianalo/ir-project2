The agency voted 4-0 for a proposal that would effectively freeze the prices ATandamp;T charges for interstate long-distance services. These so-called price caps then could be adjusted annually to reflect changes in inflation, tax rates, industry-wide productivity and telephone-connection fees assessed by local telephone companies.    &quot;The price-cap proposal holds the promise of better protecting and promoting the public interest,&quot; said FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick. &quot;If we can realize that promise, future ratepayers will pay lower prices for telecommunications services and will have choices among a wider variety of services.&quot;    ATandamp;T wouldn't be able to raise its prices much each year under the price caps. Even so, the proposal could be a boon for the company, because if ATandamp;T can find ways to lower costs, under the proposal it can keep most of the cost savings. Currently, the FCC regulates ATandamp;T's profit margin; any cost savings that push profits above the allowed limit must be returned to ratepayers.    Since 1984, the FCC has forced ATandamp;T to lower rates about 34% to reflect the lowered cost of telephone-connection charges, pushing ATandamp;T's competitors into the red. Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said the agency ought to force rates down even more to reflect technological changes. The rate-cap proposal &quot;is a back-door bailout of the long-distance industry,&quot; he charged. &quot;It's an attempt to cover up the failure of competition.&quot;    The commission will take public comments on the proposal. The comment period, followed by internal FCC deliberations, probably will stretch out for many months before the commission devises a final rule to vote on.    The proposal is certain to stir controversy on Capitol Hill. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on the ATandamp;T proposal in September. &quot;The price cap is the FCC's social welfare plan to redistribute the wealth from telephone consumers to telephone company shareholders,&quot; he contended.    But Congress has had little luck so far in reversing the agency on telephone disputes. The issues are complex and arcane, and rarely inspire much consumer interest. In addition, the lobbying muscle of ATandamp;T and other phone companies has proven sufficient to stifle legislation aimed against them.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, ATandamp;T closed at $32 a share, up 25 cents. It was the most-active issue, with 2.7 million shares changing hands.    Mr. Patrick and other FCC commissioners say that traditional regulation, which allows telephone companies to recover costs and earn a fixed percentage as profit, stifles innovation and causes companies to pad costs. But price caps may also cause a host of problems. &quot;Price caps are a superb theory, but they're a killer to put into practice,&quot; said Albert Halprin, who recently resigned as chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau.    ATandamp;T has hundreds of individual services, and figuring out a cap for each one could be an administrative nightmare. Moreover, the agency is banking on arriving at a &quot;productivity&quot; index that will require ATandamp;T to pass on some cost savings to consumers, but it hasn't yet figured out a formula for the index. Even setting the initial cap could be a problem, since current rates may be too high or low for certain services.    Nevertheless, the agency is committed to the price-cap concept. Mr. Patrick, a former FCC commissioner who took over as chairman in April, has staked his reputation on the proposal. And the agency also plans to use price caps in regulating the regional Bell telephone companies once the caps took effect for ATandamp;T.    The FCC regulates only that portion of the Bell companies' revenues that relate to interstate charges. But the rate-cap proposal would spur similar plans at the state level.    An ATandamp;T executive said the company is generally pleased with the FCC's move, but that a number of issues remain to be ironed out. One of the biggest is how productivity improvements will be reflected in prices in the future, said Larry Garfinkel, vice president, marketing services for ATandamp;T. &quot;We don't have a feel for&quot; how such productivity improvements will be measured or reflected in future price changes, he said. &quot;I would hope it won't be as complicated as rate of return.&quot; He suggested that the FCC could follow the example of Britain, which has arbitrarily chosen to allow rates to rise by inflation minus a percentage that is politically palatable.    Mr. Garfinkel also said ATandamp;T would probably price its services below any price cap. &quot;Our technology and competition will lead us there,&quot; he said. He added that the proposal should allow ATandamp;T to more quickly modernize its network, bringing in new services.    The industry, including regional Bell companies and long-distance competitors, expressed support for the proposal. John Hoffman, senior vice president of US Sprint Communications Co., says it moves the industry toward a competitive, rather than a fully regulated structure. Bell Atlantic Corp. said it supported the move and called for an end to profit-margin regulation for that portion of its own assets that are regulated by the FCC.    ---   Janet Guyon in New York Contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
