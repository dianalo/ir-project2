Erich Gruenberg, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in 1731,as he checked through customs after arriving from London at LosAngeles International Airport on Tuesday afternoon, said citypolice Sgt. Dave Nichols.   The musician reported the violin disappeared from the baggagecart as he was leaving the airport, Nichols said.   The instrument was insured for about $500,000. Also stolen werea violin worth $8,000 and two bows worth $3,500.   There were no arrests by early today, Nichols said.   Thefts at the airport are a common occurrence, but the thief maynot have realized what it was he was plucking from the cart,Nichols said.   ``If he reads the paper he will, so I guess it won't take himtoo long to figure it out,'' he said.   Scholars estimate that Antonio Stradivari made nearly 1,120 ofthe prized violins bearing his name before his death in 1737. Lessthan a few hundred are believed to exist.   Gruenberg's whereabouts were not known. Nichols said he believedthat Gruenberg came to Los Angeles on vacation and was staying withfriends.   The Austrian-born performer and music teacher makes his home inEngland and has played with the London Symphony Orchestra. He nowappears as a soloist with leading orchestras in Britain and abroad.He was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music inLondon on July 4.</TEXT></DOC>
