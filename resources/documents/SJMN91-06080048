She didn't know about the ad, and excused herself toask someone about it. When she returned, she confirmed the special and took myname. I asked if I needed to bring the ad with me, and she said no. When thebill came, we noticed we were each charged $10.95. When I complained, I wastold I needed the coupon to get the two-for-one special. I was told I wouldreceive a refund if I came back with the ad. The ad doesn't state that it is acoupon, or that you have to bring it in.;    -- Kittrill Talasaz, Los Altos  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COUPON REDEMPTIONWASN'T HER CUP OF TEA  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  A total misunderstanding, says Lisa A.
