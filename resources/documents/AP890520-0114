(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rally marking the 20th anniversary ofthe People's Park occupation turned into a violent clash withpolice reminiscent of one of the bloodiest riots of the 1960s.Twelve people were arrested.   Fifteen police officers were injured during the riot Fridaynight and Saturday morning near the University of California atBerkeley, including one who was hit over the head with a bottle,said police spokesman David Anderson. None, however, washospitalized. Two firefighters also suffered minor injuries.   About 70 Berkeley and 30 university police scuffled withcombatants in a crowd of about 1,000 as piles of trash weregathered and torched and looters smashed store windows, then fledwith merchandise.   At least 28 businesses were damaged during the violence, but nodollar estimate was immediately available, Anderson said. No otherinjuries were reported.   Two Berkeley fire department vehicles were overturned and onewas set one fire, said Anderson, who estimated the damage at about$40,000. Another fire engine was vandalized while responding to afire at an intersection in the middle of the riot.   The scene was an eerie replay of the 1969 clashes whose focuswas the 2.3-acre university-owned lot that the university hadtargeted for housing. Activists wanted to turn it into a park, andthe dispute came to embody all that the two sides hated about eachother during that protest-filled decade.   But this weekend's violence seemed oddly out of context.   ``What started here tonight was something that began as a socialprotest but it quickly degenerated into just plain vandalism,''University of California student David Brooks, 19, said Fridaynight.   The rally started about 10 p.m. and broke up about an hourlater, but the crowd gathered again and smashed windows and lootedabout a dozen stores in the nearby business district. Most of theaction was about a half-block from the park and some three blocksfrom the UC campus.   ``I thought that People's Park was all about creating peace, butthese riots have no place in the peace movement,'' said JuliaTolley, who stood outside a boutique with her boyfriend, RustyPacatte, owner of the store.   The couple said several thousand dollars in merchandise werestolen from the store, which carries expensive householdfurnishings and clothing.   The same Bank of America branch that became a regular activisttarget in the 1960s was struck again by an arsonist.   ``He lit a paper bag on fire and stuck his hand through a brokenwindow,'' said 17-year-old Greta Salmonson. ``It took a few minutesand then the flames started coming up.''   Some of the crowd tried to put out the fire, said 24-year-oldpolitical science major Blake Marnell. The bank's carpeting andpaneling were scorched before Berkeley firefighters doused theflames.   Streets were littered with broken glass, capsized newspaperracks and burning trash cans. A clothing store was trashed, and twohusky students stood guard in front of the store, trying to keeplooters from entering.   Seven of those arrested were adults. Five were booked forinvestigation of possession of stolen property, one forinvestigation of assault with a deadly weapon and assault on apolice officer, and another for investigation of inciting a riot,Anderson said.   Five juveniles were arrested for investigation of possession ofstolen property, he said.   People's Park has remained virtually untouched, an encampmentfor the homeless, since activists occupied it a generation agoafter the university drew plans to erect student housing there.   During the original occupation, gardens were planted in rolledsod, tents went up and long-haired protesters moved in. Theuniversity finally fenced the lot on May 15, 1969.   When protesters tried to cut down the fence, they were met withheavily armed sheriff's deputies, who peppered dozens of protesterswith birdshot. One man, James Rector, died a few days later. Anartist was blinded and two news reporters were among those who werehurt.   Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent 2,000 National Guard troops tooccupy the city for 17 days. A nightly curfew was imposed andmeetings of more than three people were banned. In the first weekafter the riot, 1,000 people were arrested.   In 1972, the university agreed to allow limited public access tothe still-vacant park. But it has never formally abandoned plans tobuild student housing and recreational facilities at the site,prompting some recent protests.</TEXT></DOC>
