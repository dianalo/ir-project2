U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson issued a preliminary injunction against a Commerce Department permit that allows the Japanese fleet to fish in U.S. waters between June 10 and July 31. She ruled that the permit appears contrary to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which bars the killing of seals, dolphins and other marine mammals where that might harm their species' chances of survival. The mammals are trapped in salmon nets.    Judge Johnson withheld the effect of her injunction until she sets a bond, an action that isn't expected until Friday. But her ruling delighted U.S. environmental groups and shocked representatives of the Japanese fisheries.    The dispute could exacerbate U.S.-Japanese trade tensions. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Washington said yesterday that it had just learned of the ruling and had no comment.    John Hodges, an attorney for the Federation of Japanese Salmon Fisheries Cooperative Association, said he is appealing to the circuit court here to overturn Judge Johnson's injunction and at the same time is asking the judge to stay her injunction.    &quot;The idea of being shut down in the middle of the season certainly seems to us to be very unfair,&quot; Mr. Hodges said. He said the Japanese fleet already is committed to spend more than $40 million on salaries, gear and fuel.    The Japanese fleet catches salmon in 10-mile long nets that also trap porpoises, seals and small whales. The Commerce Department's permit allows the Japanese to fish on the condition that they kill no more than 6,039 Dall's porpoises over three seasons.    Judge Johnson ruled that the permit appears contrary to law because it ignores the expected trapping of other marine mammals, especially northern fur seals. The seal populations are below &quot;optimal sustainable&quot; levels in Alaska's Pribilof Islands, according to the Commerce Department.    Department lawyer Jay Johnson said, &quot;I suspect we'll be appealing.&quot; But he said it remains to be seen if the environmental groups who brought the suit can afford a bond that would be held to compensate the fisheries if they win the case. </TEXT></DOC>
