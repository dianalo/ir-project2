Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by PremierNikolai I. Ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000people died in the Wednesday earthquake, which measured 6.9 on theRichter scale. Soviet officials reported thousands of people werekilled but provided no death toll.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the UnitedStates and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort insouthern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million.   ``Urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected bythis terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this effort,''Gorbachev said before leaving New York. He canceled trips to Cubaand Britain.   The Soviet news agency Tass announced Gorbachev's arrival inMoscow early Friday. It did not say whether he would stay or flyimmediately to Yerevan, the capital of the small Soviet republic inthe Caucasus Mountains.   President Reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid, CubanPresident Fidel Castro pledged to send construction workers, andBritain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort.   The epicenter of the quake was 25 miles northeast of Leninaken,on the Turkish border. The U.S. Geological Survey said the initialshock was followed four minutes later by an aftershock measuring 5.8on the Richter scale.   Soviet TV showed a clock on a building in Leninakan, Armenia'ssecond-largest city, stopped at 11:41 a.m. (2:41 a.m. EST) _ theinstant the disaster struck.   The earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, which has apopulation of 250,000, a TV correspondent said.   Spitak, a town of 16,000 about 45 miles away, ``was practicallyerased from the face of the Earth,'' the correspondent said.   Hundreds of thousands were left homeless in the region, he said.   Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, hadcrumbled.   A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republicswas called in Yerevan on Friday to discuss disaster relief.   Soviet authorities dispatched doctors, engineers and food andmedical supplies to the area, and a ``helicopter bridge'' was set upto ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring SovietGeorgia, the Tass news agency reported.   Tass said 2,300 people were hospitalized in Yerevan with injuriesfrom the quake and that 200 were hospitalized across the border inGeorgia. It did not say how many of the injured were treatedelsewhere.   For a second night Thursday, millions of Soviet TV viewers sawsoldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles ofconcrete rubble, by hand or with cranes. The disaster coverage bythe state-run media was unprecedented in its speed and scope.   Ryzhkov, head of an earthquake commission, told Soviet televisionthe main task before authorities is to search for the injured anddead.   He then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusualappeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait tobe asked, but to start immediately sending heavy cranes, helicoptersand other equipment.   Friday and Saturday were declared days of mourning in Armenia.   Tass quoted Nikolai Shebalin, a laboratory director at the SovietInstitute of Earth Science, as saying more earthquakes were likelyin the region, but they should be weaker. Less powerful aftershocksnormally follow a strong earthquake.   Soviet TV and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported fromLeninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands ofpeople were killed.   Foreign Minister spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said authorities werehaving difficulty calculating a death toll because communicationswith the region were severed.   He said the Foreign Ministry was reviewing requests by foreignreporters to visit the disaster area, but that none had beenapproved.   Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers were working under spotlightsin the wreckage of a Leninakan school. It said two sergeants pulledthe bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only afew children had been found alive in the collapsed building.   Blood donations were being collected throughout the Soviet Unionfor quake victims. Tons of blankets, field kitchens, tents andmedicine were pouring into the region, Tass said.   Soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in thedevastated regions, and restoring electricity and water supplies,army Gen. Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass. Bonfires burned in theshattered cities to warm the homeless in the December chill.   The newspaper Izvestia reported the population of Armenia hasswelled in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnic strifebetween Armenians, who are mostly Christian, and predominantlyMoslem Azerbaijanis.   About 180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the borderbetween the two republics in the last three weeks.   The last earthquake in the Soviet Union with a death toll in thethousands was on Oct. 5, 1948, in Ashkhabad, the capital ofTurkmenia. The Soviet press _ acting under Gorbachev's policy ofglasnost, or greater openness _ recently gave the death toll for theAshkhabad quake as 110,000.   A quake of 6.9 on the Richter scale is capable of causingwidespread damage. The scale is a measure of ground motion asrecorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means atenfold increase in magnitude.</TEXT></DOC>
