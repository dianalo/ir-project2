(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' haseliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundredsor thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushingatmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never supportanything resembling human life.   Venus is not exactly Kansas.   For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probeMagellan will circle the second planet from the Sun, usingcomputer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitablethat its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellanmission will yield valuable information about the formation ofEarth.   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something thatwill completely astound and baffle us,'' said Steve Saunders,Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttleAtlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-monthtrajectory to Venus.   Pictures from Magellan should help scientists deduce ``theprobability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _somewhere else,'' said geologist Laurence Soderblom, a scientistworking on the Magellan project.   Peering through acid-laden clouds, Magellan should givescientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly differentfrom the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologicprocesses.   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like ourown Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' NASA says.   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionarymovement of huge land masses. Magellan will also look for evidenceof wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier U.S.and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies soclose to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites mightproduce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands ofvolcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest.   Magellan, once it begins orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, willlook for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence theplanet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphereacted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised thetemperature until water disappeared.   It's a $550-million project with the scientific world watching.   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or justone of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solarsystem,'' said Soderblom, who works for the U.S. Geological Surveyin Flagstaff, Ariz.   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plottingthe path of Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of theplanet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977miles.   In looking for similarities between Venus and Earth, scientistsbegin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight anddistance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon,Mercury and Mars.   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hotfor a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' saidSaunders, himself a geologist.   The moon, Mercury and Mars have cold surfaces free ofcontinental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives thegeological machinery,'' however, scientists believe Venus and Earthboth give off heat through volcanic activity and movements ofgargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said.   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusianvolcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differsfrom that on Earth.   Rock in Earth's crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-beltmanner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ underseamountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed awayfrom these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventuallycollides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subductionzone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath Alaska, Washingtonand Oregon.   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges andsubduction zones. Saunders and Gerald Schaber, another USGSgeologist, believe Venus loses its internal heat mostly through``hot spot'' volcanoes.   On Earth, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises throughthin parts of the crust, such as in Hawaii. But there's evidencethat Venus has crustal movement similar to Earth and that thevolcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of Earth's midoceanridges.   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones onVenus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys aresqueezed up against Venus' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite andIshtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than Everest.   These regions look something like Earth's Himalayas, mountainsformed when India smashed into China. So crustal movements on Venusmay be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without largechunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, Schaber said.   If large plates of Venus' crustal rock are in motion, ``you canbet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
