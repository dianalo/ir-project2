About 8,000 riot officers moved into the downtown area of thisstrike-bound port, arresting 433 workers and students to thwart arally called by labor groups to denounce President Roh Tae-woo'sgovernment.   Police armed with shields and clubs guarded factories andpatrolled streets, dispersing onlookers and keeping the area clear.Officials said 800 people trying to reach the rally at Masan, 185miles southeast of Seoul, were turned back at roadblocks.   About 50 students held a brief protest in the heart of Masan,chanting slogans, but fled when riot squads arrived. An estimated4,000 workers who could not get to the rally site conductedpeaceful demonstrations at their plants.   ``How can we march for our rights when there are so manypolice?'' one dissident leader said, on condition of anonymity.   In Seoul, a 24-year-old union leader at a garment factory dousedhimself with kerosene and set himself afire to protest poor workingconditions, news reports said. He was in critical condition and afellow worker whose clothing accidently caught fire also washospitalized, the reports said.   Many riot officers in Masan wore black mourning ribbons for thecomrades killed Wednesday in nearby Pusan, South Korea'ssecond-largest city, when police raided a college trying to rescuefive police officers being held hostage.   The officers were climbing a barricade when radical students setit afire, police said. The hostages were freed later.   Roh said Wednesday he would use emergency powers if necessary tohalt weeks of violent protest by radical students and militantworkers trying to bring down his government.   South Korea's constitution allows the president to rule bydecree or impose martial law in an emergency.   Confrontations between protesters and riot police are common inSouth Korea, but rarely are people killed. Officers carry shields,wear helmets and fireproof clothing, and normally are armed onlywith tear gas and clubs.   Opposition leaders as well as government officials appealed foran end to the violence after the deaths Wednesday. It was thegreatest loss of life in political violence since 1980, when atleast 192 people were killed in an ant9-government uprising.   Police said Thursday they would charge five student leaders withmurder and arson, for which the maximum penalty is death. Policealso seek charges against 50 others.   Legislators of the government and opposition parties agreed toenact laws against firebombs.   The Education Ministry was given authority to request policeintervention against campus unrest. Previously, the decision wasleft to individual schools.   In Seoul, a total of about 1,000 radical students shouting``Down with the Roh regime!'' marched on at least three campusesbut avoided clashes with police.   ``We will go ahead with our anti-Roh campaign, but this time wethink we have to restrain ourselves,'' a student leader said.   Radical students are a vocal minority on campuses, but havelittle public support because of their violent tactics and extremeviews. The government is concerned about their efforts to makealliances with militant workers against the government.   Roh has introduced democratic reforms, but the radicals contendthe former general is a front for the military.   Farmers and radical students shouting anti-American slogansdemonstrated in Chonan and Taejon on Thursday against imports ofU.S. farm products and the stationing of American troops in SouthKorea, according to news reports.   Students have attacked U.S. government and military facilitiesas part of a campaign for immediate withdrawal of the 43,000American troops in South Korea.   They contend the presence of American troops blocks unificationwith communist North Korea. The peninsula has been divided since1945 and the two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53.</TEXT></DOC>
