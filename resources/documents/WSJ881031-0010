In this fall's race for the U.S. Senate, the Republican candidate's campaign is full of Kennedyesque strains. The Democrat's campaign is by far the better financed. The Republican candidate embraces Michael Dukakis's views on defense spending. The Democrat thinks businessmen ought to have a bigger say in running the government.    And that's only the beginning. The favorite -- an unmarried, 53-year-old Democratic grocery-store magnate who has never held political office -- caused a furor when he couldn't remember the name of the secretary of defense, confused the MX missile with the cruise missile and at one point couldn't remember whether he favored or opposed the B-1 bomber.    The underdog Republican is a 36-year-old mother of two who was the first female floor leader of the state Senate, whose rival for the Republican nomination thought she was too liberal and brought Oliver North and Phyllis Schlafly into the state to criticize her and who is on the defensive for taking political-action committee money even though she is being outspent by nearly 3-to-1.    Whatever happens in the election a week from tomorrow, Democrat Herb Kohl and Republican Susan Engeleiter are engaged in a campaign out of keeping with the traditions of this maverick state.    The breeding ground of the Progressive movement in American politics, an oasis of civility and good government, the last refuge of the reformers, Wisconsin is finally catching up with the rest of the country. The only real issue in the state's Senate battle is money.    When Democratic Sen. William Proxmire, who is relinquishing his seat after 31 years, ran for his fifth term in 1982, he spent $145.10. Mr. Kohl has spent $5.4 million, most of it from his own pocket, and the campaign still has a week to run.    Even his critics acknowledge that Mr. Kohl, who operated a chain of 100 grocery stores and bought the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team to prevent them from leaving town, has spent his money shrewdly. Although Wisconsin races tend to tighten in the last week -- yesterday's surprise endorsement of Mrs. Engeleiter from the ordinarily Democratic Milwaukee Journal may turn some heads -- Mrs. Engeleiter is trailing in all the polls and no tactic she has tried seems to be able to break Mr. Kohl's stride.    Mr. Kohl's trick is simple. He's done with about $4 million of his own money -- there is plenty more should he need it -- what Mr. Proxmire did with $145.10 -- prove he's independent.    &quot;It's brilliant,&quot; says Robert Williams, a prominent Republican from Stevens Point. &quot;But the result may be that the Senate is moving toward being a House of Lords. If this can happen in Wisconsin, it can happen anywhere.&quot;    Indeed, the phenomenon of Mr. Kohl's rise deeply troubles many political professionals in this state, Democrats as well as Republicans.    Mr. Proxmire has endorsed his fellow Democrat on Wisconsin television. But on the Senate floor he said that Mr. Kohl &quot;had one great asset -- money and lots of it&quot; and suggested that Mr. Kohl was skewing Wisconsin politics. &quot;As a retiring senator who followed the . . . painstaking route of years of one-to-one hard campaigning work, I am disillusioned and more than a little jealous.&quot;    Republicans are more bitter. &quot;He bought himself a lot of name identification,&quot; says state Sen. Donald Stitt, the GOP chairman. &quot;And if he wins, he will have bought himself an election.&quot; Former Republican Gov. Lee Dreyfus, who has endorsed Mrs. Engeleiter, adds: &quot;This is out of control. We are now saying that any candidate who wants to be competitive has to have the big money -- either his own or someone else's. Wisconsin always looked askance at that.&quot;    Ironically, in the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Kohl, who derisively dismisses his rival as &quot;a career politician,&quot; is attacking her over money. &quot;Susan Engeleiter is heavily financed by defense contractors,&quot; he says, &quot;and who could deny that would provide {them} access?&quot;    For months Mr. Kohl's television advertisements have proclaimed he'd be &quot;nobody's senator but yours.&quot; The implication is that a man who lists 55 assets of more than $250,000 each on his campaign disclosure form and who boasts &quot;I don't need&quot; special-interest money, is too rich to be influenced by anyone's campaign contribution.    Mr. Kohl, however, has no political experience -- a fact that may explain the unusual number of substantive gaffes he has made since entering the race in June. By contrast, Mrs. Engeleiter is a highly respected 13-year veteran of the state Legislature.    In debates and public appearances, Mrs. Engeleiter has been saying that her rival &quot;suggests I'm not fit to be a senator because I'm not a millionaire who can finance my own campaign.&quot; Her television advertisements reinforce the message by asserting she has &quot;experience, energy and ideas that money can't buy&quot; and by arguing that she &quot;wasn't born into a world of privilege, but she was raised with a wealth of determination. It's the Wisconsin way.&quot;    Mr. Kohl's money isn't Mrs. Engeleiter's only problem. In the GOP primary, former state party chairman Stephen King suggested a mother of pre-schoolers should stay in the house and keep out of the Senate. That remark shadows her even now.    The fact that this is a &quot;woman with kids is a bigger factor than anyone will admit,&quot; says Todd Robert Murphy, a Milwaukee marketing executive who is involved in GOP politics. Mrs. Engeleiter and her husband, a business executive, haven't decided whether the family will move to Washington if she prevails in the election.    Wisconsin has a tradition of strong female leadership dating to Glory in the Morning, who led the Thunder Clan of the Winnebago Indians in the 18th century, and continuing with former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier, who grew up in Milwaukee, and artist Georgia O'Keefe. But feminists haven't rushed to Mrs. Engeleiter's defense because they feel her views on abortion -- she opposes a constitutional ban but supports federal financing for abortions only in cases of rape, incest or danger to the health of the mother -- don't go far enough. Still, they go too far for conservatives in her own party.    Mr. Kohl, however, does provide conservatives with a tempting liberal target. He wants to cut defense spending by 10%, a view Mrs. Engeleiter gleefully asserts isn't shared by a single member of Congress or even the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Kohl wants to scrap the Midgetman and Trident missiles and stop production of the MX. He wants to change the landmark tax-overhaul package passed in 1986 to tax those earning $200,000 or more at a rate of 38% rather than 28%. And he wants to raise the wage base for Social Security taxes to $70,000 from its current $45,000 level.    The only feature of this fall's race that is consistent with the Wisconsin political traditions is that neither candidate is a conventional political figure.    Mrs. Engeleiter has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the statewide gay and lesbian newspaper. Mr. Kohl, who wants to sharply reduce the funding of the Strategic Defense Initiative, gave a $1,000 donation in 1982 to Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wy.), perhaps the most conservative member of the Senate on defense matters and the most outspoken advocate of deployment of Star Wars technology. &quot;These things happen in life from time to time,&quot; Mr. Kohl says. &quot;This was a relatively small contribution.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...While in Minnesota, Issues Place Second to Negative Ads&quot; -- WSJ Oct. 31, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
