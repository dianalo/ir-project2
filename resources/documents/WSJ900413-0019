Hughes Aircraft is a subsidiaryof General Motors Corp.   McDonnell Douglas Corp. was defeated by France'sArianespace in a separate bid to launch the two satellites,Telebras said.</LP><TEXT>   The two contracts have a combined value of $244.3 million-- $155.5 million for the satellites and $88.8 million forthe launchers, Telebras added.   The awarding of the contracts caps over one year ofinternational lobbying, high-level diplomacy and internalpolitical disputes. The dispute became so fierce that therewas speculation that Brazil would simply reopen the biddingrather than make a decision -- raising fears that thecountry's telecommunications system could collapse.   The fight centered on who would supply Brazil with twosecond-generation satellites having both civiltelecommunications and military applications.   To win the satellite contract, Hughes outbid a consortiumformed by Canada's Spar Aerospace, France's Matra S.A. andBrazil's Victori International. While Hughes's price waslower than the consortium's final offer, opponents said theyoffered more generous technology transfer conditions.   The previous government avoided a decision and passed theproblem to the newly installed government of PresidentFernando Collor de Mello.   In bidding for the launchers, Arianespace offered to sellBrazil technology to produce large rocket engines. The U.S.government asked France to provide assurances that theseengines would be used for peaceful purposes. Brazil said itwas interested in the engines to develop an independent spacebusiness. McDonnell Douglas said that U.S. laws on technologytransfer barred it from matching Arianespace's offer.</TEXT></DOC>
