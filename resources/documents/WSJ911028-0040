The CIA reports -- distributed broadly through theregulatory apparatus -- mainly concerned BCCI's suspectedinvolvement in drugs, terrorism and arms dealing, RichardKerr, the acting CIA director, told a Senate panel. He addedthat a few of the reports, beginning in early 1985, statedthat BCCI in 1981 had secretly and unlawfully acquiredcontrol of First American Bankshares Inc., Washington'slargest bank holding company.</LP><TEXT>   Such intelligence on BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. wasmet with &quot;a stony silence and lack of action&quot; on the part ofregulators, said Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), chairman of theSenate Foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcoticsand international operations, which is conducting hearings onBCCI.   The revelations came as President Bush moved to distancehimself from a former high-ranking White House aide whorecently went to work for Sheik Kamel Adham, a principalfigure in the BCCI scandal. The former official, Ed Rogers,senior aide to Chief of Staff John Sununu, is a lawyer whosigned up to receive $600,000 from Mr. Adham in a two-yearengagement.   At a news conference Friday, President Bush expressedconcern about the &quot;perception of impropriety.&quot; When areporter suggested Mr. Rogers might be selling his access tothe White House, the president snapped, &quot;Ask him what he'sselling.&quot; President Bush said he himself wouldn't like suchwork: &quot;Would I like to go out there, leave my job and go towork for this sheik when I get through being president? No, Iwouldn't like to do that.&quot;   Mr. Rogers said in a statement that this representationwas lawful under the Ethics in Government Act and that itdidn't involve any &quot;lobbying, politics or public relations.&quot;He added that he and his law firm have had no contact with&quot;anyone at the White House about this matter.&quot; As reported,Mr. Rogers was in Egypt last week when a top federalprosecutor in the BCCI case opened talks with Mr. Adham,suggesting that a plea agreement might be in the works.   In his testimony, Mr. Kerr said that the CIA's focus onBCCI began in the mid 1980s because of the Luxembourg-basedbank's suspected involvement in &quot;narcomoney laundering,&quot;which involves helping drug traffickers conceal the originsof their profit. That effort widened in the late 1980s,resulting in the collection of intelligence on &quot;themanipulation of financial markets, weapons proliferation, andterrorism.&quot;   CIA intelligence on BCCI, Mr. Kerr said, was sent to anumber of government departments, including Treasury,Customs, Commerce, the Drug Enforcement Agency, NationalSecurity Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, the FederalReserve Board, the Department of Energy, the U.S. TradeRepresentative, the State Department, and the Federal Bureauof Investigation.   Specific information relating to BCCI's hidden ownershipof First American was sent to the Treasury Department's headof intelligence, Mr. Kerr said. That Treasury official hastold colleagues that he passed the information along toRobert Bench, who was then deputy comptroller of thecurrency. Mr. Bench is now partner in charge of governmentrelations at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm thataudited BCCI for years. Mr. Bench said recently he doesn'trecall seeing such a report.   Mr. Kerr sought to refute widespread rumors and reports ofCIA involvment with BCCI, asserting that the agency &quot;didn'tassist or encourage any wrongdoing on the part of BCCI or itsemployees.&quot; The agency, he said, also hadn't taken any action&quot;to influence or impede&quot; any investigation or prosecution ofBCCI.   The CIA official also said that the agency wasn't involvedin, nor did it have knowledge of, any use of BCCI for thesale of arms to Iran or the diversion of funds for theNicaraguan Contras in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.The Senate subcommittee released documents indicating thatBCCI provided banking services to Saudi Arabian businessmanAdnan Khashoggi in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.Mr. Kerr said the CIA wasn't aware of BCCI's Iran-Contralinks or of its association with Mr. Khashoggi.   The State Department, meantime, also had substantialinformation on BCCI, Alan Kresczko, the department's deputylegal adviser, told the Senate panel. As early as 1978 theState Department noted that BCCI engaged in, &quot;questionable ifnot illegal activities.&quot;   U.S. relations with the United Arab Emirates, where BCCI'sprincipal owners reside, &quot;remain very good,&quot; Mr. Kresczkosaid. The government of Abu Dhabi and its absolute rulerSheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan own 77% of BCCI.   BCCI's seizure of a group of Western regulators last July&quot;may create some cash flow problems for the UAE,&quot; Mr.Kresczko said. But, he maintained, there is &quot;no evidence thescandal has eroded the hold on power of the rulers of AbuDhabi or their popular base of support.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
