Meanwhile, bloodflows by the bucketful in South Africa.   Somehow, the struggle isn't very romantic anymore. Overthe weekend, Zulus with AK-47s raided a Xhosa hostel andkilled at least 21 people. Many were shot while they slept.The Xhosa-dominated ANC gangs have been equally brutal.They've also continued their campaign of liquidatingmoderates.</LP><TEXT>   On Sunday, Soweto town councilor T.A. Nkina was deemedinsufficiently radical by some ANC soldiers, who surroundedhis house. He called police but by the time they arrived, hewas dead, his throat slit. More than 4,000 people have diedin tribal warfare over the past three years, 363 alone lastweek.   We have suggested in the past that the anti-apartheidstruggle isn't merely a U.S.-style civil-rights campaign ondifferent shores. In a July 1985 editorial, we argued thatLebanon is a more accurate model for understanding SouthAfrica: &quot;South Africa is less a cohesive nation than alandscape of many rival factions living under an uneasytruce. Despite the evil of apartheid, the lines of divisiondo not fall neatly between white and black. Rather, thedivisions run like cuts in a huge jigsaw puzzle.&quot;   South Africa, we pointed out, has four major and 23 minorlanguages. The largest group, the Zulus, consists of about200 tribes. There are 11 other black ethnic groups. Thesecond largest is the Xhosa. Nelson Mandela and his wife,Winnie, come from aristocratic Xhosa families.   We kept repeating these facts because the sanctions anddivestment groups refused to acknowledge them. Westernanti-apartheid activism became fixated with the moralsuperiority of their stance. The activists were drawn to themost romantic and radical of the anti-apartheid groups, theANC.   Meanwhile, the activists heaped scorn upon the Zulu-ledInkatha movement, with 1.7 million members. Inkatha isequally fervent in its opposition to apartheid, but it favorsfree markets and opposes sanctions. The ANC strategy is toisolate and discredit Chief Buthelezi, before he can turnInkatha into a nationwide political party. Last month, threeANC guerrillas were arrested and accused of plotting toassassinate senior Inkatha leaders.   Mr. Buthelezi is not the only black leader who worriesthat the ANC wants to completely dominate black politics.Major black nationalist groups, including the Pan-AfricanistCongress, Azapo and the National Council of Trade Unions,recently opposed an ANC-called strike.   Last month, Sam Mabe, an editor of South Africa's largestblack newspaper, the Sowetan, was gunned down. Nothing wasstolen, and his friends say the murder was political. Mr.Mabe was a leader in the Nation Building Campaign, whichwants blacks to build up their economic power and not focussolely on gaining political power. On a visit to the U.S.last year, Mr. Mabe, a former leader of the Black MediaWorkers Association, told us many ANC members opposed a blackfree press and had often tried to intimidate him.   So far, the ANC has successfully excluded Inkatha andother black groups from the negotiations with the whitegovernment. The ANC's friends in the West never encouragedthe group to acknowledge Inkatha's legitimacy. Westernsupporters of the ANC thus became opponents of politicalpluralism. Instead, they loaded up the entire outcome of thecomplex South African equation on the fortunes of one group,the ANC.   Civil war was the predictable (and predicted) result. Nowthere are voices on the South African left calling for talksbetween Inkatha and the ANC. But far away, in the U.S. and inEurope, South Africa no longer fits into domestic politicalagendas. To those who had so many blunt solutions for SouthAfrica, it seems fair to ask, what now? Any recommendations?</TEXT></DOC>
