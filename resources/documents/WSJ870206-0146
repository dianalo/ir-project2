Not mentioned was the fact that the national forests have 25% fewer trails than they did 50 years ago. Yet trail use has increased manifold, and is expected to continue rising. The chief culprit in trail loss is the U.S. Forest Service, which continues an orgy of costly road building in previously roadless areas. Already there are 350,000 miles of forest roads (most built for logging) and the Forest Service plans 40,000 miles more over the next 10 years.    It is time for a moratorium on Forest Service road building and a restoration of trails.    Prof. Anderson prefers private campgrounds and corporate forests to public ones. Yet the typical private campground is a dismal trailer village overlooking a busy highway. And the private preserves, taken as a whole, represent a minuscule area, compared with public lands.    Yes, the U.S. holds more public land than do European countries, for example. But then Europe has virtually no wilderness areas, having lost them long ago. Fortunately, Americans have had the foresight to preserve, as Congress put it, &quot;for present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.&quot; Does anyone suppose the U.S. wilderness system, with its matchless recreational benefits, could exist without public lands?    &quot;The idea of wilderness needs no defense; it only needs more defenders,&quot; writes Edward Abbey. Too bad Prof. Anderson is not one of them.    Robert L. Crockett   Dallas</TEXT></DOC>
