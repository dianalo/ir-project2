(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>101 Hard DrivesandM;The hardest thing about hard-disk drives is making the right choice fromamong the hundreds of available models.andP;  There are speeds that would makeChuck Yeager plae, capacities that would have overwhelmed Orson Welles, casesthat might make a La Croix model appear naked, and prices that could make asheik shriek.andM;Yet if you're serious about getting the most from your Mac, you need ahard-disk drive.andP;  Their multimegabyte capacities let hard drives store allyour favorite applications and related documents in one place, where you canaccess then much faster than with floppy drives.andP;  Once a luxury item, thehard drive has become a necessity in today's world of gargantuan graphicsfiles and seam-bursting System Folders.andM;Hard drives are available in such an abundance that evaluating them andpicking the best ones turned into the most challenging project yet attemptedby MacUser Labs.andP;  In keeping with the needs and budgets of typical Mac users,we decided to test only external drives with capacities of less than 100megabytes.andP;  Even so, we managed to pile up 101 SCSI drives from 31 vendors,leaving little room for our technicians to squeeze into the labs.andP;  (For alook at drives with capacities in excess of 100 megabytes, see &quot;Big HardDisks,&quot; June '88.)andM;The 101 drives cover a wide range, from disks for which we'd gladly pay listprice ($399 for 20 megabytes up to $2,295 for 80 megabytes) to those we'dhappily throw into a body bag and bury.andP;  In the interest of fairness, wetested them all but established six categories based on capacity -- 20, 30,40, 60, 80, and 90 megabytes -- and compared individual drives only withother drives that had a similar number of megabytes.andM;Initially, we limited our focus to three measures: megabytes, milliseconds,and manufacturing quality.andP;  After all, with any hard drive, you're buyingstorage capacity, speed, and hardware that you're likely to keep as long asyou keep your Mac -- and possibly longer.andP;  We compared megabytes per dollar,ran DiskBasher! to determine speed, and examined the guts of each drive.andM;Using the information garnered in the first round of tests, we calculatednormalized scores for each drive by weighing bytes per buck (50 percent),DiskBasher! (25 percent), construction (12.5 percent), and ease of setup(12.5 percent).andP;  To narrow the field down to a select 18, we chose the 2top-scoring drives in each size category in addition to a third drive thatdidn't necessarily rate among the highest (usually because of inflated retailpricing) but that we felt deserved special recognition.andP;  In addition, a driveseries that won in one category was automatically eliminated from competitionin the others.andP;  This approach let us highlight as many vendors' drives aspossible.andP;  When a drive is recommended in one category (such as the jasmineDirectDrive 40), however, it usually means we liked the same line of drivesin other sizes too.andM;We then tore into the finalists with a vengeance, benchmarking every aspectof performance, checking safety features, grading workmanship, and evenmeasuring temperature and noise levels.andP;  After weeks of intense evaluation,we can confidently recommend the best external drives for your Mac.andM;Before going any further, we should note that with the exceptions of Rodimeand Western Digital, most vendors don't manufacture the mechanisms that arethe heart of any disk drive.andP;  Of the 101 drives from 31 vendors, only 11 OEMS(original-equipment manufacturers) are represented.andP;  Vendors buy diskmechanisms in bulk from OEMs and then assemble them in a case with a powersupply, cables, and other components.andP;  More than anything else, the mechanismdetermines the drive's performance.andP;  Keep this in mind, because some vendorsvary the mechanisms they use, depending on market price and availability.andP;  Ifyou're interested in a certain drive because it contains a Seagate ST125N-1mechanism, for example, make sure that's the model you get, not the slowerST125N-0.andP;  Some vendors openly admit to switching mechanisms; others hidethat fact.andP;  If a vendor isn't willing to commit to providing the mechanismyou want, you'd best take your business to one that will.andM;Bytes and BucksandM;Just as a one-size-fits-all wardrobe is likely to leave you with sleevesdangling to your knees, no one hard drive can possibly be the ideal fit forall systems and situations.andP;  You must weight what you want and what you canafford, to reach a compromise.andM;The first decision to make concerns capacity.andP;  How many megabytes of storagedo you want?andP;  How many do you need?andP;  There is a golden rule that simplifiesthis decision: All else being equal, buy the largest-capacity drive you canafford.andP;  No one has ever regretted having an excess of megabytes.andM;Larger-capacity drives are better buys too.andP;  Building a hard-disk drive is alesson in economics, with both fixed and variable costs.andP;  Every external harddrive, no matter what its capacity, requires the same basic ancillaries: acase, a power supply, and minimum-wage labor to screw everything together.andO;Those fixed requirements mean that even before the drive mechanism goes in,the product costs in the vicinity of $200.andP;  For a 20-megabyte drive, that maybe more than half the retial price.andP;  For a 90-megabyte drive, it may be lessthan a quarter.andM;To compare the economics of similarly sized drives, divide their formattedcapacity by price.andP;  If the bytes per buck are relatively close, make yourbuying decision based on speed or some other factor.andP;  We could have presentedthe megabytes-per-dollar results, but the prices in the &quot;Buyer's Guide to 101Hard Drives&quot; table are manufacturers' list prices.andP;  They don't necessarilyreflect actual &quot;street&quot; prices because mail-order vendors rarely discounttheir drives as much as do vendors that employ dealer channels.andM;Racing the InterfaceandM;Besides price, the most important drive attribute is speed.andP;  A hard driveshould be an asset to your Mac, not an anchor that slows its performance.andO;Ideally, you need a drive that can spin off its information as fast as yourMac can use it.andP;  Drives vary widely in their performance: Some areagonizingly slow; others are blazingly fast.andP;  It may buck conventional logic,but sometimes it's wiser to buy a slow drive.andM;You see, external hard-disk drives attach to the DB-25 connector on the backof all Macs since the Plus.andP;  This connector is the SCSI port, and it providesa standard way for attaching multiple devices -- such as hard-disk drives,scanners, and CD-ROM drives -- to the Mac.andP;  The problem vis-a-vis hard-drivespeed is that the three different series of Macs -- the Plus, the SE, and theII family (including the SE/30) -- have different maximum limits on theirSCSI throughput: about 2,104; 5,248; and 11,200 kilobits per second,respectively.andP;  You should buy a drive that closely matches the transfer rateof your Mac's SCSI interface; anything faster may be wasteful because SCSIbecomes a bottleneck.andM;One populr measure of a drive's speed is seek time, the theoretical averagetime required to move the read/write head from one track to another.andP;  OEMsusually report this time in milliseconds, with lower seek times indicatingfaster drives.andP;  The primary factor in determining seek time is the mechanicaldesign of the disk drive itself (see the &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andP;  Theproblem with seek times is that they aren't useful for comparions betweendrives, because two drives with the same seek times may perform verydifferently in real-world situations.andP;  Because Mac files tend to be large,data throughput is more important than seek time.andM;To measure the raw drive speed of our 18 top picks, we used SCSI Evaluator, ashareware utility that writes nonsense blocks (not actual files) to thedrives.andP;  As Figure 1 shows, even the slowest of our top picks -- the Ehman 60-- has an average throughput in excess of the maximum SCSI transfer rate ofthe Mac Plus.andP;  Only an elite few are faster than an SE, and none can attainthe 11,200-kilo-bits-per-second limit of the Mac SE/30, although theMacProducts MagicDrive 91 comes close.andM;All the drives have the potential to outrun the SCSI port on a Mac Plus, butthat doesn't mean they all perform the same in daily use.andP;  To test thereal-world speed of all 101 drives, we used DiskBasher!, an exclusive MacUserLabs benchmark.andP;  DiskBasher! simulates typical drive performance by readingand writing actual files, unlike SCSI Evaluator, which measures purethroughput.andP;  It's like the difference between your actual milage and the EPAratings for automobilies.andP;  The DiskBasher! results (lower times indicatefaster drives) listed in the &quot;Buyers Guide to 101 Hard Drives&quot; table weregenerated on a Mac SE/30.andP;  Because of their slower SCSI interfaces and lesspowerful CPUs, a Mac SE takes 60 percent more time, on average, and a MacPlusrequires 200 percent more time (see Figure 2).andP;  The MicroNet MS62 was theslowest of all 101 drives, and the Relax Hard 90 Plus was the fastest.andM;Mixing SectorsandM;What happens if your hard drive can dish up data faster than it can betrasferred to the MAc?andP;  Well, believe it or not, you wait a lot.andP;  Tounderstand why, you need to know how data is stored on and retrieved from ahard disk.andM;Before any data can be written to a hard disk, the disk needs to beformatted.andP;  During a low-level format, a formatting utility lays out apattern of concentric circles (called tracks) on the disk.andP;  Each trackcontains many sectors.andP;  After the tracks and sectors are in place, data canbe written to the disk.andP;  Later, when an application requests data from thedisk, the drive moves its read/write head to the appropriate track and sectorand begins reading the data that was written before.andP;  It sends the data backto the Mac, one sector at a time, waiting for the go-ahead from the SCSIinterface before sending the next sector.andM;If the requested data is in contiguous sectors and the SCSI interface givesthe go-ahead fast enough, the drive can efficiently transfer all thenecessary data in one pass of the read/write head.andP;  If the SCSI interface istoo slow, however, the drive will be able to transfer only one sector of dataat a time.andP;  It must then wait for at least another full rotation of the diskuntil the next sector is again correctly positioned under the read/writehead.andP;  Each rotation requires about 1/60 of a second -- a lifetime incomputer terms.andM;To avoid this time-wasting spinning in place, hard-drive makers employ atrick called sector interleave.andP;  Instead of logically consecutive sectorsbeing placed one after another on the hard drive's magnetic platter, they arephysically laid out in an alternating pattern (see Figure 3).andP;  While thedrive waits for the Mac to catch up, only the intervening sectors (ratherthan the whole platter) spin past before the heads read again.andM;Interleaving makes a drive perform faster, but too much of a good thing --interleaving too many sectors -- can degrade performance.andP;  Too muchinterleaving means you have to wait for too many sectors to spin past beforethe drive is ready again.andP;  Thus, finding the optimum interleave for a givencomputer helps eke the most performance out of a hard-disk drive.andM;Interleaves are normally expressed as the number of sectors that must spin byfor each sector that is read.andP;  As a general rule, the best interleave fordisks on an unaccelerated Mac Plus is 3:1; on an SE, it's 2:1.andP;  The SCSI portof a Mac SE/30 can outrun even the fastest drive, so a 1:1 ratio is usuallybest.andM;If we hold these truths to be self-evident, then it's impossible for a diskto be interleaved properly for all Macintoshes.andP;  You need the ability to setthe number.andP;  As the host (interrogator in sCSI terms), the Mac comes from thefactory set as device 7.andP;  Your hard drive can be given any other SCSI ID from0 to 6, with one important caveat: No other SCSI device can have that samenumber.andM;You can set SCSI ID numbers in several ways.andP;  The choices include mechanicalsettings using DIP (dual in-line) switches, push buttons, jumpers, andspecial software that alters nonvolatile memory on the drive.andP;  An example ofa drive that has the latter is the MagicDrive 91 from MacProducts USA, whichincludes a setup utility for selecting its SCSI ID.andP;  In general, externalswitches are preferable to internal ones, because they don't require you toopen the case.andP;  And recessed switches are preferable, because you're less aptto inadvertently change them when blindly groping around for the power switchon the back of a drive.andP;  Rotary switches and push buttons are best becausethey -- unlike DIP switches and jumpers -- instantly show the SCSI IDsettings.andP;  Software-based solutions mean you must keep the software diskaround (or clutter your hard disk with little-used utilities).andM;SCSI systems also require that the devices at either end of the daisy chainbe terminated.andP;  This stipulation ensures that all signal voltages reliablyfall within the right range and prevents unwanted signal reflections fromappearing on the SCSI lines.andP;  Ordinarily, the SCSI protocol calls for thehost to include one terminator in its circuitry, but for reasons known onlyto Apple and God, the Mac lacks one.andP;  Consequently, the Mac SCSI connectionrequires two terminators: one each on the first and last devices in the daisychain.andM;Vendors have differing approaches to termination.andP;  Most disk mechanisms comefrom the OEM with removable terminating resistors installed in the drive.andO;Some vendors -- such as LaCie, Mac Land, and Mirror -- leave these in placeand require you to disassemble the case to get at them if required with yourhardware configuration.andP;  The kinder and gentler vendors provide an accessdoor on the bottom of the case that lets you pop off the resistors withoutdisassembling the unit.andM;A better approach is for the vendor to remove the drive's resistors andprovide an external terminator plug instead.andP;  If you need termination, youslide the supplied plug into the last connection in the SCSI chain.andP;  Althoughit's connection in the SCSI chain.andP;  Although it's one more thing to lose orhave fall off, the termination plug is a simple, effective method that givesa visual confirmation of whether it is installed or not.andP;  Apple, Deltaic,EMAC, GCC, and others have chosen this termination scheme for their drives.andM;Western Digital takes a unique approach with its Preference drives, using anexternal SCSI identification switch that also enables termination.andP;  The lowerseven selections of the switch terminate the SCSI lines, and the upper sevenleave them unterminated.andM;Projecting LongevityandM;Once you have these SCSI issues solved and your hard drive running, you hopeit will stay that way.andP;  Reliability is a multifaceted issue because harddrives can suffer indignity of magnetic, mechanical, and electronic failures.andM;Included among the mechanical problems are head crashes.andP;  These occur whenthe drive's read/write head, which normally flies only microinches above thedisk surface on a cushion of air, touches the disk itself.andP;  If the disksurface is soft or the head movement is violent (say, for instance, the diskdrive is dropped), the disk can be damaged.andP;  Worse, material kicked up in thecrash can cause further damage later on.andP;  To guard against head crashes, besure your drive is able to automatically park the read/write heads away fromthe data portion of the disk whenever it's switched off.andM;Whereas ahead crash can take out your hard disk is one fell swoop, drivesface another menace that slowely drains their life away--heat.andP;  The hotterthe temperature at which the drive and its electronics operate, the shortertheir lives will be.andP;  Most vendors include a cooling fan of some sort, buthard drives differ wildly in how well their cooling systems work.andP;  Airflow isthe deciding factor.andP;  Most fans are disgned primarily to cool the powersupplies; only incidentally do they cool the hard disk.andP;  But a properlydesigned system circulates air throughout all components of the drive system,keeping everything cool.andP;  The Aristotle HARD-PAC, iDS PRO, Liberty, RelaxSierra, and Tallgrass TravelPac drives lack fans altogether.andM;To evaluate the cooling abilities of the drives and give some prediction ofdrive life, we used a Fluke 51 F/J Digital Thermometer to measure thetemperature inside our 18 top picks after they had been running overnight inour air-conditioned labs, which have an average ambient temperature of 72degrees Fahrenheit.andP;  Our measurements showed a wide range of temperatures.andO;The warmest drive, the Crate MacCrate 60, ran a full 28 degrees hotter thanthe coolest drive, the Storage Dimensions MacinStor 90 (see Figure 4).andO;Although none of the drives reviewed operated outside the manufacturer'srecommended temperature range, cooler operation should give you moreconfidence in a product.andM;Note, however, that cooling must be weighed against other factors.andP;  The Ehman60, for instance, ran at a cool 90 degrees but could wake someone from a deepsleep with its 51-decibel fan, which is almost as loud as conversationalspeech.andP;  We measured all the drives' noise levels in a controlled environmentwith a hand-held Cel Instruments CEL-254 Digital Impulse Sound Survey Meter(see Figure 5).andP;  The average ambient noise in the lab was 35 decibels.andM;Construction DeductionandM;In picking a reliable drive, also consider the care with which it is puttogether.andP;  MacUser Labs disassembled every drive tested to evaluateconstruction care and overall quality.andP;  Our final judgments were based onfactors including design and layout, workmanship, component choice, andwiring.andP;  For instance, loose wiring can work its way into dangerouspositions.andP;  Wires lying atop power-supply heat sinks may short out.andP;  Webelieve that the care taken in the manufacture of a hard-disk system pays offin longer, more reliable life, so we formed our conclusions about qualityaccordingly.andM;For example, the Liberty 40 and 80 are the smallest external drivesavailable.andP;  The vendor has managed to squeeze a 3.5-inch-disk mechanism intoa tiny case with a small power supply.andP;  Unfortunately, with two of the unitswe tested, some electronic components were poorly positioned and eventuallyacred to the metal case, blowing up the power supply of one unit and trippingthe circuits on our lab bench with the other.andP;  We were about to issue thesedrives a bomb in our mouse ratins when the manufacturer brought us a revisedmodel designed to eliminate this hazard.andP;  After roughhousing with the newLiberty drives, we're pleased to report that the problem appears to be fixedand that the drives merit a 3.5-mouse rating.andM;Because many vendors use the same mechanisms, we also tested the other majorcomponent in a hard drive: the power supply.andP;  Power supplies are designed todeliver specific voltages within a narrow range.andP;  Too much fluctuation, andthe electronic equipment on the receiving end -- in this case, the diskmechanism--can be in for trouble.andP;  We used a Fluke 87 True RMS Multimeter tomeasure the actual output of the power supply in our top picks and found thatall of them operate within specification.andM;Big Bad BundlesandM;As mentioned previously, most vendors buy the same basic off-the-shelfcomponents, screw them together, put them into a case, and slap their logo onthe front.andP;  In an effort to differentiate their offerings from thecompetitors, many vendors sweeten the deal with free software.andM;Bundled software runs the gamut from scads of freebies thrown in seeminglyfor sheer volume alone to well-chosen commercial applications that normallyretail for hundreds of dollars.andP;  Dolphin, iDS, Jasmine, LaCie, andMacProducts fill up their drives with megabytes of shareware, public-domain,and &quot;demoware&quot; programs.andP;  If you're just getting started and need to build alibrary of software, such loaded drives are a good idea.andM;More-discriminating buyers may be interested in specific commercial programssuch as DiskFit, DiskTop, Fastback, II, PC Tools Deluxe, QuicKeys,Silverlining, SUM II, and SuperSpool, to name a few.andP;  These packages, indifferent combinations, are available from Ehman, GCC, Jasmine, LaCie,Maxcess, Rodime, SuperMac, and Storage Dimensions.andM;Although we didn't have the resources to evaluate all the bundled software,the Software heading in the &quot;Buyer's Guide to 101 Hard Drives&quot; table containsa checklist of the types of programs bundled with specific hard drives.andP;  Someof the more useful utilities handle spooling, partitioning, backup, passworkprotection, data encryption, file recovery, and disk optimization.andP;  Printspoolers take care of printing in the background so that you can continue towork.andP;  Partitioning software can divide one large physical drive into severalsmaller logical drives that appear on the desktop individually.andP;  Backupsoftware copies files from the hard disk to another medium for safekeeping.andO;Password protection prevents other from accessing your hard disk without theappropriate passwork, and data encryption scrambles the contents so that evenif they break the passwork, the information they get is gibberish.andO;File-recovery utilities can rescue deleted or damaged files.andP;  Finally, disckoptimizers reorganize disk contents into contiguous blocks, thereby improvingperformance.andM;The Hard PartandM;As we said at the outset, with 101 hard drives, making the right choice is adifficult decision.andP;  You must balance your needs against your means; tradeoff value for speed; and consider intangibles such as reputation of thevendor, construction quality, and case aesthetics.andP;  There is no one &quot;best&quot;drive, but see the &quot;Bottom Line&quot;

 Keep in mind, however, that you'lloften have to trade off price for performance.andP;  The Ehman drives, forexample, are almost always the least expensive -- and slowest -- in each sizecategory.andP;  Worth knowing about if you're on a budget, worth avoiding if youhave a real need for speed.andM;After testing, disassembly, and full evaluation, two leaders emerged -- theJasmine DirectDrive 40 ($599) and the Microtech Nova 40 ($649) -- both fromthe hostly contested 40-megabyte category.andP;  These mail-order products use thesame high-performance Quantum ProDrive 40S mechanism to deliver speed enoughto outrun any Max except an SE/30.andP;  And both demonstrate uncommonly goodworkmanship.andP;  Despite its lower price, the DirectDrive comes loaded with 10megabytes of &quot;freebie&quot; software and some good commercial applications, suchas SUM II.andP;  Both Jasmine and Microtech offer drives in several other sizesthat share many of these admirable qualities and are also worthy of yourattention.andM;These drives are available only from their vendors, but some people preferthe convenience and security of buying from a local dealer.andP;  The best picksfor retial purchase include the Apple Hard Disk 80SC ($1,795) and the HeartHD 1040 ($ 839).andP;  The Heart drives are reasonably inexpensive and quite fast,and they come in zero-foortprint cases with all the details done right.andO;Though admittedly expensive, Apple hard drives are simply the best-designedand -built systems availableandM;Computer author Winn L. Rosch thought he had a remarkable hard-disk-drivecollection until he saw the stack in MacUser Labs.andP;  Thoroughly disheartened,he's gone back to work on a sequel to his book The Winn Rosh Hardware Bible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
