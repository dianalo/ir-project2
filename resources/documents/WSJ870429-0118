By skillful use of the differing interest rates here on deposits and loans in various currencies, they've managed to make major consumer purchases without spending their own money.    Usually, they put the money for a new car or other big purchase into an Australian-dollar deposit account. Then they use the deposit as collateral to borrow Hong Kong dollars to make the purchase. As with other arbitrage transactions, this system is highly vulnerable to exchange-rate moves and other market conditions.    But, in just one recent example of how it can be profitably used, a local businessman who made an Australian-dollar deposit of about $25,000 (U.S.) got an interest rate of 15 3/8% a year, guaranteed for three months. With the deposit as collateral, he then secured a revolving credit facility at the same bank, in Hong Kong dollars, with an interest rate of 8%.    He used the credit facility to buy a $25,000 car, and he's receiving net interest income of a little over $150 a month after making the payments because of the wide difference in interest rates.    As an added bonus, the Australian dollar has been rising against the Hong Kong currency, providing him a paper profit of about 10%, or $2,500, on his deposit.    The risks are clear, however. If the Australian dollar had depreciated instead, the businessman would have had a paper loss and might have been asked for additional collateral or had his loan called.    In addition, most banks here will lend no more than 80% of a customer's deposit. The businessman obtained a 100% credit facility against his deposit because he had a longstanding relationship with his bank. And many banks won't lend against deposits in currencies that are susceptible to steep depreciation. For instance, Standard Chartered Bank won't consider New Zealand-dollar deposits, which currently yield 27% a year, as collateral. The Australian dollar is regarded as more stable.    Changes in interest rates also can sour arbitrage arrangements, and bankers say they expect the gap between interest rates on the Australian dollar and the Hong Kong dollar to narrow.    Still, while the opportunity lasts, more and more people here are using interest arbitrage to finance major consumer purchases and even to pay taxes. This is despite the fact that most banks aren't promoting it -- mainly because they don't make much money on it.    Interest arbitrage has only been possible here for about two or three years. The wide gaps among deposit and lending rates in various currencies came along fairly recently, and most banks used to have policies against accepting foreign-currency deposits as collateral.    But intense competition for consumer banking business has forced a change. &quot;Nearly all the banks in town will lend you money against your deposit,&quot; Chan Kam Tseung, a loan officer at Hang Seng Bank, says. &quot;This type of lending business has increased rapidly in the past couple of years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
