Dukakis did not campaign this week for today's primaries inNebraska and West Virginia. He took the weekend off and spentMonday at the Statehouse. Dukakis paid visits to both Nebraska andWest Virginia last week, however.   Dukakis has said he is still focusing on Jesse Jackson and theremaining primaries, but his comments about Bush and the meetingwith New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley were signs he is lookingincreasingly toward the fall campaign.   ``I think that the American people deserve an overallexplanation about who in this administration was doing businesswith him (Noriega) and why,'' Dukakis said Monday.   ``I can tell you one thing: If I'm the president we won't bedoing business with drug-running Panamanian dictators,'' Dukakissaid as he left his Statehouse office.   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said Monday that the vice presidentwas aware before Noriega's indictment on drug charges in Februaryof speculation that the Noriega government was involved in drugtrafficking. But Teeley said the information was not substantive.   Bradley told reporters that his meeting with Dukakis centered onU.S.-Soviet relations. He said the topic of the No. 2 spot on theDemocratic ticket did not come up during the meeting, adding he wasnot interested and would be a poor choice anyway.   ``That's not in the cards,'' Bradley said as he left Dukakis'office. ``Massachusetts and New Jersey don't go well together.''   Bradley said he did not think Dukakis' lack of foreign policyexperience would hurt him in his expected general election campaignagainst Bush, although the vice president has already raised theissue.   ``Experience is no substitute for ability and he's got realability,'' Bradley said.   Bradley said he expected Dukakis to defeat Jesse Jackson in NewJersey's primary June 7, the same day as the California primary.   The Massachusetts governor said he and Bradley ``had a gooddiscussion.''   Dukakis plans to travel to Washington, D.C., on Thursday formeetings with congressional leaders including House Speaker JimWright of Texas and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of WestVirginia.</TEXT></DOC>
