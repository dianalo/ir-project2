Their action is a result of the increased environmentalcompliance costs and the liability associated with waste handling anddisposal. An attractive alternative to traditional methods is sourceprevention aimed at reducing or eliminating wastes at the point of generation.Source prevention, often used synonymously with waste reduction, mayinclude reuse/recycling, product reformulation, chemical substitution,process alterations, and housekeeping improvements. Many of these techniquesdo not require high technology and are inexpensive relative to theirpotential long-term economic benefits. Often they can be implementedwith minimal disruption to the production cycle. In 1986, according toOTA, government at all levels spent $16 billion on environmental protection,of which only $4 million was devoted to waste reduction. Most waste reductionadvocates, including EPA, OTA, Inform, the United Nations, and the NationalAcademy of Sciences, generally agree that a national waste reductionprogram should be encouraged by government technical assistance grants,programs of technology transfer, improved data collection and reportingmechanisms, public education, and a national policy that puts waste reductionat the top of all waste control options.</TEXT></DOC>
