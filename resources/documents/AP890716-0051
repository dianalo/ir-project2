But the square lay awash in trash Sunday after the concert theday before, and residents were complaining about violence, drug useand littering during the show that drew an estimated 200,000 peopleto this city of 83,000.   ``Venice has been desecrated. Excrement on the streets, filtheverywhere, violence, and drugs. Venetians can take no more ofthis,'' said Augusto Salvadori, president of the Committee for theDefense of Venice.   But fans complained about the lack of services, saying the cityprovided no special facilities such as toilets or special emergencyvehicles at the concert. A 24-hour transport strike exacerbatedproblems, causing chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. Manyconcert-goers slept in the streets.   Police said 80 people suffered minor injuries in a scuffle in thesquare shortly before the concert began, when a group of fans brokethrough a barrier. Scattered cases of vandalism also were reported.   The 90-minute show, performed on a floating stage in the Venicelagoon, included laser lights and old and new hits.   It was broadcast live in Italy and 23 other countries, reaching atotal audience of 100 million people, according to the state-run RAInetwork. It was not broadcast in the United States.   The concert set an attendance record as Italy's largest rockevent and attracted more visitors to the historic city than did theannual Carnival festival.   City preservation officials had threatened to deny permission forthe concert. But on Thursday they dropped their objections whenconcert organizers agreed to measures to reduce potential damage tothe surrounding buildings.   The stage was pulled farther from the shore than previouslyplanned and the rock group reduced its volume to a maximum of 60decibels instead of 105 as planned.   Italy's vice premier, Gianni De Michelis, spoke out in favor ofthe concert.   ``Venice must give space to all cultural languages, includingthat of rock music,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
