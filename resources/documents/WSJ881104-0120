The trading bloc opened two days of discussions yesterday with a Soviet delegation led by Ivan Ivanov, vice president of the Soviet state commission for foreign economic affairs.    The talks, described as exploratory, are designed to get a feeling for what each side would like to see in any agreement later worked out in negotiations.    During previous contacts, the Soviets indicated they would be interested in an agreement with the wealthier European countries covering a wide variety of areas, including high technology. The transfer of such sensitive technology to Moscow is tightly controlled.    &quot;They asked for everything,&quot; Mr. De Clercq said before the talks. &quot;It is a question if the community can accept or will accept . . . so broad a cooperation that is very likely going to be asked.&quot;    Mr. De Clercq said an agreement with the Soviet Union could cover cooperation in the environment, energy, transportation and exchange of information and statistics. West European businessmen are interested in gaining greater access to the Soviet marketplace, he said.    The trading bloc generally works out agreements with other countries that lead to greater trade. But the Soviet Union has limited products that West European countries would be interested in buying.    Mr. De Clercq said any serious negotiations on such a pact likely wouldn't take place until next year at the earliest.    The Common Market nations imported $15.2 billion in goods from the Soviet Union in 1987 and had exports totaling $10.7 billion, according to EEC figures.    The improved East-West relationship has raised concern that Moscow will gain access to high technology that could improve its military might. &quot;There is this concern about transfer of technology,&quot; said Alfred H. Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the ECC. &quot;We all feel strongly that whatever is happening in Eastern Europe could be used to our mutual advantage,&quot; he said.    The export of sensitive Western technology, such as supercomputers, is controlled by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which maintains a list of items embargoed for export to the Soviet bloc. </TEXT></DOC>
