The vote, by a divided and apparently indifferentcommission, is the agency's first action in several years onthe question of whether short-selling -- a bet on stockprices to drop-hurts or helps companies and the financialmarkets.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal issued for comment would force short-sellersto disclose when they were short an amount equal to 5% of acompany's common stock outstanding. Short-sellers borrowshares, usually from brokerage houses or institutions, andimmediately sell them. They eventually have to purchase thestock to return to the lender, and they profit if the stockprice has fallen in the meantime.   The meeting was marked by a discernible lack of intereston the part of the four-member commission about a topic thatintrigues many corporate executives and Wall Street moneymanagers. Much of the 15-minute discussion preceding the votewas consumed by irrelevant banter about securities rules andregulations.   The SEC also approved yesterday the creation of anelectronic library for municipal-bond documents. But theaction came only after the agency put aside for the moment asignificant part of the rule proposed by the MunicipalSecurities Rulemaking Board.   The library will create a central repository for alloriginal documents filed by issuers of muni bonds, a movethat the SEC hopes will shed some light on an otherwisecloaked area of the markets. Vendors will be able to buytapes from the MSRB and repackage the information to sell toinvestors, trading houses and others.   &quot;While the size of the municipal market is roughlyequivalent to the corporate bond market,&quot; said CommissionerRichard Roberts, &quot;the municipal market has operated in anenvironment that largely has been free from the same specificdisclosure and reporting requirements that apply to corporateissuers.&quot;   But the electronic library will deal only with theoriginal filings of muni bond issuers. A separate MSRBproposal for a system for issuers to voluntarily provide datafor the much larger secondary market for trading existingissues ran into a buzzsaw of opposition led by SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden. He and others objected that the proposedsystem for the secondary market would only be able to receiveelectronic filings, making it too expensive for many muniissues to comply voluntarily. So the agency tabled the itemuntil it could work with the MSRB to allow paper filings.   The board, which was created by Congress to watch the muniindustry, said in a statement after the meeting that papersubmissions would create &quot;an enormous undertaking&quot; comparedwith the proposed system and would introduce many volume andindexing problems.   The short-selling plan was introduced by the commission atthe behest of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies, agroup that represents about 800 companies, most of whichtrade over the counter. The group has been lobbying the issuefor several years, trying to prod Congress and the SEC tostop what it sees as abusive practices by short-sellerswhich, the group argues, constitute stock manipulation and&quot;bear raids.&quot; Last year, a bill that would have created a 5%disclosure rule garnered little support in the House.   Most of the commissioners expressed little support for theplan at yesterday's meeting, despite their vote to put it outfor a 90-day comment period. But most didn't oppose it,either. Mr. Breeden, for example, said he has &quot;nopredisposition whatsoever&quot; either for or against the proposedrule.   But Commissioner Edward Fleischman voted against theproposal, arguing that the SEC was proposing a rule beforecompiling comprehensive statistical evidence on the effectsof short-selling. Without such a study, he added, it wasdifficult to support &quot;possible commission intervention,broadside, into the public equity markets.&quot;   The question of compelling disclosure of short positionstouches on a variety of significant market issues, most ofwhich the SEC skirted in its discussion. For example, theproposal adds another element to the debate over whyinvestors are forced to disclose their holdings to regulatorsand investors. Any shareholder or group that buys 5% of acompany's shares must tell the SEC of that holding within 10days, and must disclose its intentions.   Opponents of the short-sale rule argue that the 5%ownership provision tells investors about possible changes ofcontrol at a company. A similar short-selling requirementwould serve no such purpose, they note.   But proponents counter that it would help companies andinvestors to know when short-sellers are taking largepositions in certain companies. They contend it would helpstop &quot;bear raids,&quot; in which a number of short-sellers gang upon a stock, usually an over-the-counter issue, in an attemptto drive the price down. John Guion, president of theAssociation of Publicly Traded Companies, said he willencourage his members to write to the agency, describingtheir experiences with short-sellers.   Any move to curb short-selling abuses in theover-the-counter market would be welcomed by Jeffrey Malet,manager of the $125-million Pacific Horizon Aggressive GrowthFund of La Jolla, Calif. The OTC market is particularlyvulnerable to sharp hits from short-selling pressure, hecontends, because it doesn't have an &quot;uptick rule&quot; designedto curb abuses, as the New York and American stock exchangesdo. An uptick rule forbids short-selling except when the lastprevious trade in a stock was higher -- that is, made on anuptick.   &quot;The shorts know it doesn't take a lot to create sellingdemand in OTC stocks&quot; and quickly drive prices lower, Mr.Malet said.   At least one short-selling firm will counter with acomment letter of its own. The SEC &quot;is responding to sourgrapes from companies whose corporate performance is lessthan stellar and has resulted in large short positions,&quot; saidJoseph Feshbach, general partner of Feshbach Brothers, alarge money manager specializing in short selling. Mr.Feshbach, who estimates that the plan would affect about 50investment firms, calls the SEC move &quot;just another fabulouswaste of government money.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
