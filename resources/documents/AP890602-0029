Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``So this is clearly asetback, but if everybody works hard I believe we can still get thejob done.''   Wright resigned Wednesday in an emotional speech in which hedenied the findings of the House ethics committee, which charged heviolated House rules of conduct in 69 instances.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, said Wright's loss means aheavier burden for him as chairman of the Senate Finance Committeebecause of its broad jurisdiction.   ``Where I could count on Jim Wright to pick up that part overthere on the House side, along with the members of the Texasdelegation, he had an extra bit of muscle as speaker. So it'll beup to the rest of us to make up for that,'' said Bentsen, whochairs the Senate's most influential committee.   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said: ``We've lost an importantspokesman for our agenda which means the rest us of us have to linktogether, work a little harder and make it happen.''   Chapman says Texas will be losing the vigilant eye of someonewho could spot and stop ``the late hour mischief that can occur inthis place, or the possibility of late hour mischief.''   Wright also was able to restore a battered piece of Texaslegislation to its original state as it neared a final vote in theHouse, Chapman said.   ``The speaker has a tremendous influence in that process and caninfluence that process,'' Chapman said.   ``Anytime I would go to him with something for my district orTexas, I always had a friendly ear and that helped. He never turnedhis back. He always gave you effort and you felt it; not just atoken effort, he swung hard when he swung,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall,D-Texas.   Hall also bemoaned the loss of former Sen. John Tower of Texas,whose nomination as secretary of defense was rejected by the Senateamid allegations of conflict of interest, womanizing and excessivedrinking.   ``At the beginning of the year, we had the secretary ofcommerce, the president, and two of the best U.S. senators in theSenate,'' Hall said.   ``That's quite an array. We've had two major players now thatare out of the action and President Bush tied up with NATO problemsin Europe. A lot falls back on the shoulders of those two senators,who really have to give us leadership,'' Hall said.   In addition to Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and PresidentBush, other Texans in power include Secretary of State James A.Baker III, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, House AgricultureCommittee Chairman Kika de la Garza, House Judiciary CommitteeChairman Jack Brooks, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.Gonzalez, and Rep. Mickey Leland, chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Hunger.   ``Losing Jim Wright is the loss of an effective ally on Texasissues,'' Gramm said. ``But I believe Texas still has strongrepresentation in Washington and if those of us representing Texasin Washington work harder, we can protect and promote the interestsof our state, but it will be harder.''</TEXT></DOC>
