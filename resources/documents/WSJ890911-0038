Fifty people have been convicted of defrauding SBA programs in the fiscal year that ends this month, up from 28 in all of last year. About half of the cases involve the agency's minority procurement program, and a third involve SBA loan programs. One Indiana woman applied for an SBA-backed loan while on a prison-release program, falsely claiming she had no criminal record despite 12 convictions for violating federal financial laws.    One reason for the rise: SBA Inspector General Charles Gillum, who took over in mid-1987, has taken a more aggressive stance than his predecessors. He persuaded Congress to allow the SBA to audit agency-licensed small-business investment firms less frequently so that it could spend more time checking loan programs, which have about 15 times more money at risk.    Congress agreed, says a congressional aide, because in the investment program SBA auditors &quot;generally know who the bad actors are.&quot;    ---   TOUGH QUESTIONS face Kyo Jhin, President Bush's nominee to head the SBA's Office of Advocacy. Senate confirmation hearings late this month will focus on his political fund-raising and his financial disclosure statement, which shows extensive assets. Mr. Jhin, who has spent his career in education, has said that in his unsuccessful run for the Maryland House of Delegates in 1986, he also raised campaign funds in California, New York and Pennsylvania.    ---   DRUG DEALS have taken on a new meaning for some entrepreneurs, says the Washington, D.C. Area Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. Over the past two years, several area small-business owners have been arrested after using cocaine as partial payment for real estate and other purchases. The council says the buyers were emboldened to pay with drugs because they also used cocaine, which in the short term can cause a feeling of self-confidence.    ---   AN INTERNAL CLASH roils behind new rules on liquidating venture-capital firms.    Following a critical audit by the agency's independent inspector general, SBA head Susan Engeleiter says such liquidations will be monitored closely by top officials to make them &quot;more efficient and effective.&quot; The audit criticized the liquidation of Royal Business Funds Corp., which defaulted on its SBA loans in 1982. The SBA had trouble selling Royal's assets and for a few years operated a ski resort once held by the concern.    But some outraged SBA officials still disagree with the auditors' charge that the separate company set up by the SBA to handle the liquidation was illegal. The SBA will ask the Justice Department to resolve the dispute. &quot;If the operation was legal,&quot; fumes one SBA employee, &quot;their whole case falls apart.&quot;    &quot;They accused us of Monday morning quarterbacking, but that is by definition what auditors do,&quot; counters a staffer in the inspector general's office.    ---   SMALL TALK: About 75% of small businesses had profits under $50,000 or lost money in 1988, says a survey of its 35,000 members by the Boston-based Small Business Service Bureau; similar results are expected this year . . . Small businesses grouse they still must comply with the Section 89 employee-benefits law even though Congress has barred enforcement of it in 1990, a situation one wag calls &quot;Catch 89.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
