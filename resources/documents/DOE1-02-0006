<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-02-0006 </DOCNO><TEXT>Because of the absence of vitrinite in lower Paleozoic sediments, thereflectance of pyrobitumen is used as an indicator of thermal maturation.A new technique of preparing organic matter permits discrimination amongtypes of zooclasts and solid bitumen, including pyrobitumen, and leadsto more precise reflectance-histograms. Studies of organic matter fromOrdovician-Silurian strata of Anticosti Island show that reflectanceof zooclasts is different from that of solid bitumen, and that each groupof the following zooclasts, chitinozoans, graptolites, and scolecodonts,has a specific reflectance evolution path with increasing depth. On alogarithmic scale, the paths of the three groups of zooclasts are linear,highly correlated, and converging. However, reflectance of solid bitumenis not linear throughout the range studied; solid bitumen becomes linearonly where the reflectance is greater than 0.75%. Comparing the relationsbetween zooclasts and solid bitumen with the vitrinite-solid bitumencorrelation in the literature suggests that a hypothetical vitriniteevolution line in the Anticosti Island basin should be subparallel withthat of chitinozoans and graptolites, but 0.4-0.8% lower, in the 1-2%range. However, scolecodonts and vitrinite should have the same reflectanceat 1%, but scolecodont reflectance should be slightly (0.2%) higher fora vitrinite reflectance of 2%. 6 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
