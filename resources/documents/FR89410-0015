The regulation currently provides for thislevel of selenium supplementation in cattle (in addition to other levelsfor chickens, swine, turkeys, sheep, and ducks) by incorporating seleniuminto feed supplements and salt-mineral mixtures. In the January 6, 1988,notice of filing of the FAP, FDA invited comments on the environmentalassessment (EA) submitted by the petitioner. No comments were receivedin response to that notice.In a subsequent notice (54 FR 6029; February 7, 1989), FDA announced theavailability for comment of Schering Animal Health's revised EA, whichaddressed deficiencies FDA noted in the original EA, and of FDA's findingof no significant impact (FONSI). The FONSI and the revised EA were filedwith the Environmental Protection Agency for review. The notice was simultaneouslyfiled with State and area-wide clearinghouses. The State clearinghousesof Georgia and Ohio commented that the subject amendment to andSection; 573.920is consistent with State and local plans, programs, and objectives. Noother comments were received in response to the February 7, 1989, notice.FDA evaluated the data and information in the petition and other relevantmaterial.
