Positron annihilation measurement is quite usefulto study vacancy-type defects or microvoids, and far more sensitive comparedwith other methods such as X-ray small angle scattering technique andelectron microscopy. By analogy with metals, the {gamma}-ray spectrumradiated by positron annihilation and lifetime of positron of a-Si :H reflect the increase in the density and size of the microvoids resultingfrom the randomness of the structure and hydrogenation. The preparationconditions, such as deposition rate, substrate temperature and dopingof a-Si : H similarly influence the size and the concentration of themicrovoids.</TEXT></DOC>
