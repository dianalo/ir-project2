The 24th Division or the Iraqi army, supported by artillery andhelicopter gunships, has sought to ``encircle the region controlledby the (guerrillas) and move in to captures Kurdish bases,'' saidthe official of the outlawed Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.   At least 57 Iraqi soldiers have been killed in clashes sinceSept. 18 in Iraq's northeastern mountains, he said.   He put losses among the guerrillas, known as Peshmergas or``those who face death,'' at three killed and 12 wounded.   The official, who is known to The Associated Press, spoke in atelephone interview from a West European capital. He asked that hisname and location not be mentioned for security reasons.   Fighting centered north of Qala Diza, the city whose populationwas forcibly evacuated by the Iraqis several months ago in a driveto create a buffer zone along the Iranian border to prevent theguerrillas from receiving support from the Iran, the officialcharged.   Earlier this year, he said, tens of thousands of Kurds fromscores of villages around Qala Diza were forced out and theirsettlements were razed. The city is 15 miles west of the border.   ``So far all the Iraqi assaults have been repulsed,'' he reported.   ``The Iraqis have turned the area into one big free-fire zone inrecent months. They claim we've been crushed, but this shows thatthe Kurdish resistance is alive and kicking.''   Diplomats in Baghdad and Kurdish officials estimate more than250,000 Kurds have been relocated forcibly over the past two yearsand hundreds of villages have been razed in Iraqi efforts to isolatethe guerrillas.   The Iraqi government admits it has moved large numbers of Kurdishcivilians to other regions. But officials say this was forunspecified security reasons and to provide villagers with modernhousing.   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting on and off for morethan 50 years for an autonomous homeland.   The government promises limited autonomy and earlier this monthheld elections in Kurdistan for a legislative assembly.   Kurdish separatists charge the assembly is powerless and brandedthe voting ``no different to previous sham elections held since1975,'' when the assembly first was established.   Iraq's last major offensive against the Iranian-backed Kurdishguerrillas was August 1988, soon after a U.N.-sponsored truce haltedits eight-year war with Iran. The Iraqis allegedly used poison gasin attacks that forced tens of thousands of Kurds to flee intoneighboring Iran and Turkey. Baghdad denies the charges.   About 19 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where theborders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet. Another 1 million arescattered in the southwestern Soviet Union and northeastern Syria.</TEXT></DOC>
