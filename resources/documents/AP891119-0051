Authorities arrested 10 dissidents butleft the marchers alone.   The government denied reports that police killed a student inbloody clashes Friday, when hundreds were beaten, tear-gassed andattacked by dogs in the largest demonstration in 20 years.   Sunday's rally began with a few thousand protesters gathering ondowntown Wenceslas Square, but the crowd grew to 30,000 asdemonstrators reached Narodini Street, where white-helmeted riotpolice beat demonstrators Friday.   ``We don't let you murder us!'' the crowd chanted. They alsochanted such slogans as ``Write Truthfully,'' ``Free Unions'' and``Jakes to the dustbin.''   Milos Jakes is the hard-line leader of the ruling CommunistParty and, unlike most East bloc leaders, has resisted reformsorchestrated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   About 2,000 demonstrators split away and crossed a bridge overthe Vltava river in an apparent attempt to reach the hillsidepresidential residence.   Police did not interfere in the march but did block access tothe hill.   Those arrested included Petr Uhl, a leading human rightsactivist, who was charged in connection with the spreading of newsabout the alleged death of Martin Smid at police hands Friday. Thestate news agency CTK said he was charged with ``the crimes ofharming the interests of the republic abroad and spreading alarmingnews.''   Uhl, a veteran member of the Charter 77 human rights group, isassociated with VIA, a dissident news service active in severalEast European countries. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 3{years in prison.   Dissident sources in Prague and Vienna told The Associated Pressthat police also arrested Drahomira Drazska, who said she wasSmid's girlfriend. She claimed he was killed by special policeFriday.   Some prominent dissidents such as Hana Marvanova of theIndependent Peace Association, Emanuel Mandler of the DemocraticInitiative and Anna Sabatova, a senior member of Charter 77, alsowere arrested, the sources said.   On Sunday night, about 300 people from a dozen political groupsmet, formed an organization called the Civil Forum and adopted aresolution that demands the resignation of Communist PartyPolitburo members ``responsible for the 1968 invasion,'' includingPresident Gustav Husak and Jakes. The Soviet-led invasion in August1968 crushed a liberal Communist government.   The resolution also calls for the removal of officialsresponsible for suppressing Friday's demonstration, establishes acommission to investigate police brutality and demands the releaseof all ``prisoners of conscience.''   It said if the demands are not met the Civil Forum will back atwo-hour general strike Nov. 27. A representative of a studentgroup told the meeting students would begin sit-in strikes atseveral universities Monday.   Among those attending the meeting were representatives of theSocialist Party and People's Party, both allied with the Communists.   Protests also took place in at least eight East German citiesSunday and in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. As in Prague, thedemonstrators demanded democratic reforms but also punishment ofrecently ousted leaders _ Todor Zhivkov in Bulgaria and ErichHonecker in East Germany.   Plainclothes police in Prague prevented several reporters fromattending a scheduled news conference on the Smid case in the homeof Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova.   According to dissident sources who spoke on condition ofanonymity, police picked up some of the arrested people as theyleft or sought to enter Nemcova's apartment.   The Washington Post reported Sunday that a 20-year-old man namedMartin Smid died after being beaten by two police near WenceslasSquare Friday. Police notified his parents that he had died in anaccident, according to the newspaper, which quoted friends andwitnesses it did not name.   ``The information we have so far indicates that it was anunfounded rumor,'' government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said.   Informed unofficial sources said there may be three people namedMartin Smid in Prague, so the identity of the alleged victim wasdifficult to determine. Authorities spoke only of two Martin Smids.   State television on Sunday showed the two, both identified asstudents of mathematics at Prague's Charles University.   The first one was said to be from the town of Beroun nearPrague. The other was identified as a Prague resident, who said ``Iwas shaken'' when told of the report he was dead.   The first Martin Smid said he did not take part in the protest,while the other said he did. The broadcast said he would be allowedto continue his studies.   More than 30,000 students marched Friday for five hours tocommemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by the Nazis 50 years ago.When demonstrators tried to reach Wenceslas Square, police attackedthem with tear gas and clubs.   Hospital officials said more than 100 people required treatment.Police said more than 140 people were taken to police stations.   Charter 77 likened the police crackdown to Nazi reprisals duringWorld War II.   It was the largest demonstration in Czechoslvakia since August1969, when crowds gathered in downtown Prague a year after theSoviet-led invasion.</TEXT></DOC>
