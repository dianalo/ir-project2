Another mission for the peacekeepers is to interdict shipments ofNicaraguan and Cuban weapons the U.S. State Department says arebeing made to leftist rebels in El Salvador.   Because U.N. peacekeepers are not sent to combat areas, approvalof the border patrol operation is expected to increase pressure onNicaragua to restore its cease-fire with the U.S.-backed rebels,which President Daniel Ortega ended last week.   The unit will be the first U.N. peacekeeping force deployed inthe Western Hemisphere, although a two-man observer group wasstationed in the Dominican Republic during factional warfare in1965-66.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said it was ``a complexand ground-breaking operation, which is being set in motion in aregion characterized in recent years by its volatility.''   He said he would deploy the peacekeepers cautiously, in stages.The 15-member council gave the operation a six-month mandate thatcan be renewed.   Before the vote, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told thecouncil: ``My government supports the establishment of an effectiveand comprehensive United Nations observer force in Central America.''   Approval was delayed for several weeks by U.S. reservations.Pickering said Washington questioned whether the force was largeenough and was concerned about the cost, $41 million for the firstsix months.   Canada, West Germany and Spain will provide most of the soldiers,pilots, and staff for the operation, to be called U.N. ObserverGroup-Central America. Colombia and Venezuela have agreed inprinciple to provide troops to a Latin American contingent of theforce.   On Thursday and Friday, delegations of the Contras andNicaragua's Sandinista government are to meet at U.N. headquarters,with Honduras attending as an observer.   Nicaragua requested the talks when Ortega called off thecease-fire after 19 months, accusing the Contras of killing dozensof Nicaraguans in attacks aimed at undermining national electionsset for Feb. 25. The Contras deny making attacks.   A senior U.N. official said privately all issues would be on thetable, including the voluntary disbanding of the Contras, securityguarantees for rebels returning home and political reform inNicaragua.   The Central American peacekeeping force will have jeeps,helicopters and speedboats. Its jobs are to prevent any nation fromattacking a neighbor, verify that no rebel raiders cross borders andhalt any broadcasts by insurgents.   It will will have 260 military observers, 115 crew members forhelicopters and an airplane, 50 members of a naval unit operatingspeedboats and patrol boats, 14 medical personnel, about 104 U.N.administrators and 82 civilians recruited locally.   Headquarters will be in Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras. Theforce will have liaison offices in the other Central Americancapitals and 31 ``verification centers'' manned by mobile observers.</TEXT></DOC>
