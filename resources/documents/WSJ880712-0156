The &quot;victory&quot; celebration of those who opposed the plant may be short-lived. Without this plant, Long Island stands a very good chance of major shortages in electrical supplies during its ever-increasing peak-demand periods. This lack of reliability will be a signal to business and industry that Long Island is not a desirable place to locate. Meanwhile, local, state and national taxpayers will be joining Lilco ratepayers in footing the bill for the unused facility. These same ratepayers will be forced to pay top-market price for electricity imported into their system.    In general, nuclear power is a bargain. It provides millions of consumers with reliable, economic electricity. Why didn't this work at Shoreham? Because we've made the mistake of allowing nuclear power to become embroiled in local politics. Nuclear power should be allowed to operate in a free-enterprise system with strict, but consistent, federal regulation. What would happen to the airline industry if its safety regulations were subject to the whims of each local municipality?    William H. Miller   Associate Professor and   Director of Graduate Studies   College of Engineering   University of Missouri   Columbia, Mo.   ---   Though threats of electric-power brownouts are portrayed as stemming from the travails of the nuclear-power industry in your May 31 editorial (&quot;Lights Out&quot;), in truth an equal or greater threat is posed by the recent rule-making proposals of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.    Cogeneration facilities, independent power producers and other &quot;small power&quot; providers have proved crucial to remedying power shortages in California, Texas and other states. Yet, FERC's proposals regarding competition among producers and definition of costs for rate-making purposes are jeopardizing financing for such alternate energy projects.    In its recent proposals, FERC has shown scant regard for the role of private capital, the risk management needs of financial institutions and the ability of project finance to make a major contribution for the development of the nation's power system. Fortunately, several states and other interested parties, including the Project Finance Coalition, which is made up of U.S. and foreign financial institutions, have objected to the FERC proposals. However, unless electric-power stakeholders speak more loudly during the public comment period that ends later this month, FERC is all too likely to succeed in its current drive to impose its views on the marketplace.    The consequences of these silent FERC power pre-emptions could be far worse than those associated with the visible and noisy closing of a nuclear-power plant.    Roger D. Feldman   Executive Secretary   Project Finance Coalition   Washington   ---   Your June 9 article on the utility ratings by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette (&quot;Credit Ratings for Utilities Now Weigh Reactor Safety&quot;) based on assessments of nuclear-plant safety by James Asselstine and Paul Parshley confirms just how ridiculous the world has become. It is bad enough that in the U.S. (and nowhere else in the world) the nuclear safety regulatory process has been driven largely by lawyers rather than by technical substance; now ex-regulatory lawyers are making technical judgments on financial risks due to potential nuclear safety deficiencies.    Between Mr. Asselstine and Ralph Nader we should be able to do away with the technical experts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and end up with a nuclear industry that is unsafe at any speed except shutdown.
