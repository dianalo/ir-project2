Thornburgh, speaking to the national Civil Rights Committee ofthe Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said immigration quotaslimit the number of Soviets to 50,000 annually, but the Bushadministration has proposed an increase of 30,000.   ``We must see that the window of emigration that is now open isleft open,'' he said. ``The United States has been a beacon forthose who aspire to breath the fresh air of freedom, and we don'twant to slam a door in the face of anyone who seeks to come here.''   Thornurgh spoke about his recent trip to the Soviet Union, wherehe met with activists, and said everyone agreed the new opennessinstigated by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had truly broughtchange.   ``In 1976, when I was last in the Soviet Union, only 787 Jewswere allowed to emigrate to the United States,'' the attorneygeneral said. ``In 1990, there will be more than 100,000applications.''   Soviet Jewish emigration has increased dramatically underGorbachev, from 8,000 in 1987 to 19,000 last year and a projected35,000 in 1989. Non-Jewish emigration this year is expected toreach 15,000.   But new U.S. immigration rules have aroused some fears thatSoviet Jews could forced to go elsewhere. Under rules effectiveOct. 1, Soviet Jews no longer can leave that country with visas forIsrael, then apply in Vienna or Rome for refugee status in theUnited States. Instead, the refugees' paperwork is being processedat the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the same as any other would-beimmigrant's.</TEXT></DOC>
