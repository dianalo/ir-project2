In the <T3>Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) </T3>in General Docket 88-281,adopted May 27, 1988, FCC 88-185 (53 FR 26092; July 11, 1988), the Commissionproposed to amend Part 15 of the rules to require a label on all radioreceivers capable of receiving communications protected by the ElectronicCommunications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA). The intent of the proposed labelwas to alert users to the provisions of the ECPA relating to the interceptionof ``protected communications.'' The <T3>Notice </T3>asked for comments regarding the need for and contentsof such a label.2. Comments were received from cellular radio telephone and recreationalradio monitoring interests, e.g. scanner hobbyist, short wave listeners,etc. The cellular radio telephone interests believe that labeling is aninsufficient means for ensuring the intended protections of the ECPA. Someof the cellular interest commenters also that manufacturers should be prohibitedfrom marketing devices capable of receiving communications protected bythe ECPA. Some commenters argue that compliance with an advisory labelingrequirement may shield manufacturers from liability for violations of thelaw. Recreational radio monitoring interests agree that some communicationsshould be protected, but disagree with the proposed labeling method. Theyassert that if labeling requirements for receivers are adopted, transmitterscapable of transmitting protected communications should also be labeledto advise users that their conversations may be monitored. These partiesalso argue that in addition to the label, a clear explanation of the provisionsof the ECPA is needed in the owner's manual or elsewhere. Two commenters,one from each interest group, contend that it is premature to consideractions concerning the ECPA, since the law has been in existence for sucha short time. They state that there is no evidence to indicate that theECPA itself is not effective in controlling interception of protected communicationssuch that further regulatory involvement is needed at this time.3. The possibility of technically ``blocking'' the reception of frequencieswhich may carry protected communications also was discussed in the <T3>Notice. </T3>The Commission does not believe that technically blockingfrequencies is a desirable approach. As pointed out in the <T3>Notice, </T3>although the ECPA prohibits interception of certain classesof communications, the frequencies on which these communications are transmittedcan be used for unprotected transmissions as well. In addition the ECPAdoes not prohibit the manufacture and sale of receivers based solely onthe ability to receive specific frequencies.4. With respect to the labeling, the Commission agrees with some of thecommenters that, in some instances, a warning label, by calling attentionto a prohibited activity, might encourage it. The Commission is also persuadedthat given the complexities of the ECPA it is impractical for a singlelabel to provide sufficient information to properly advise users of thelegal requirements. The Commission noted from the comments in this proceedingthat some manufacturers are voluntarily taking steps to comply with theintent of the ECPA either by informing users of the provisions of the ECPAor by redesigning equipment to omit certain frequencies. In view of theabove considerations the Commission believes that regulatory action isnot necessary at this time. Therefore, the proposed labeling requirementis not being adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Final Analysis</ITAG>5. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared.I. Need and Purpose of This Action:The regulations proposed were found to be unnecessary at this time. Therecord in this proceeding does not sufficiently demonstrate a need forCommission action. Therefore, this proceeding is being terminated.II. Summary of Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis:No comments were received that specifically addressed the Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis. No changes to the regulations are being adopted andthere is no impact on the public.III. Significant Alternatives Considered and Rejected:The Commission considered all the alternatives in this proceeding and consideredall timely filed comments directed to the various issues in the <T3>Notice. </T3>After weighing all aspects of this proceeding, the Commissionhas adopted the most reasonable course under the mandate of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>6. The action contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to impose no new information collectionrequirements.7. Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered, </T3>that this proceeding is <T3>terminated.</T3><ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
