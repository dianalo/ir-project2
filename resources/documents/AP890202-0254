The nine-member Special Committee to Review Trading Practicesappointed Robert Wilmouth, president of the National FuturesAssociation, to assist in the review of trading procedure andpolicy, Chicago Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma said after the panelheld its first meeting Wednesday.   The futures association is the industry's self-regulatoryorganization.   The federal government is investigating allegations that as manyas 100 brokers and traders at the Merc and the Chicago Board ofTrade systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollarsthrough illegal trading practices. The ongoing two-year probe wasdisclosed two weeks ago.   Proposals for changes at the Merc are expected in two to threemonths. The proposals would then be submitted to the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates theindustry, for approval, Yemma said.   Reporters were not allowed into Wednesday's meeting, described byYemma as the first in a series planned in Chicago and New York todiscuss trading rules and procedures.   Meanwhile, the CFTC was to vote in Washington today onimplementation of the Merc's proposed Globex electronic tradingsystem, a key element in the exchange's move to set up after-hoursglobal futures trading. Electronic trading also is seen by some as away to help police improper activity by more closely monitoringdeals.   The commission's staff has recommended that Globex be approved,despite criticism from the BOT that computerized trading opens theindustry to hackers and does not eliminate fraud.   The House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday designated Rep.Glenn English, D-Okla., to direct a congressional investigation intotrading practices in the futures and options markets.   English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation,credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on theCFTC's regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating abilityof the markets themselves.   In establishing the special panel at the Merc last week, LeoMelamed, chairman of the exchange's executive committee, said therewould be ``no sacred cows'' in the examination of trading practicesin the market.   Among the practices that will come under scrutiny is dualtrading, Melamed said, in which traders can buy and sell forthemselves and a customer simultaneously.   Critics say the longtime practice invites abuse of thetraditional open-outcry style of commodities trading.   ABS Partners, the most powerful group of brokers in the exchange,has banned the practice to avoid ``an appearance of conflict ofinterest,'' the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.   There is some support among traders for elimination of dualtrading.   ``It's a conflict of interest. It's me before the customer, and Idon't think it's right,'' said Gene Sikora, who trades for Henning andamp;Krajewski Trading Co., a Chicago-based commodities brokerage.   Officials at the BOT are also examining trading practices.Chairman Karsten Mahlmann told traders this week the exchange isconsidering eliminating dual trading, and is exploring thefeasibility of electronic trading.</TEXT></DOC>
