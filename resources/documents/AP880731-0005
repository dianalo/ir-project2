The envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Ahmed Besharati, alsosaid he expected U.S. protection of Kuwaiti tankers to end soon,and that Iran is ready to use its influence for the release offoreign hostages held in Lebanon.   Besharati is on a tour of the Arab Persian Gulf nations toassure them of Tehran's intention to abide by a U.N. resolutioncalling for a cease-fire. He spoke to reporters in Abu Dhabi onSaturday before continuing to Qatar.   ``We will try to do our best not to violate anything ... so thatresolution 598 will become a reality,'' Besharati said when askedif Iran would continue to attack neutral shipping in the PersianGulf.   Besharati said now that cease-fire talks are being held at theUnited Nations, he expected ``the American flag to come down fromthe Kuwaiti tankers soon.'' He also said he believed the UnitedStates would stop providing naval escort for Kuwaiti tankers in thegulf. The tankers have been flying the U.S. flag for one year toqualify for protection against Iranian attacks.   Iranian and Iraqi representatives are holding separate talkswith U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York toarrange a cease-fire.   Asked about U.S. hostages in Lebanon, Besharati said:   ``So far, no Western country has negotiated the hostage issuewith us. If they did so, we promise to use all our influence torelease them.''   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being heldhostage by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament andcommander-in-chief, said last week that his country would beprepared to use its influence in efforts to free the hostages ifPresident Reagan released Iranian assets frozen since 1979. TheWhite House rejected the offer.</TEXT></DOC>
