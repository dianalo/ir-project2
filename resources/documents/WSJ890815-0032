But Mr. Breeden will get a tough review on Capitol Hill, where there is some skepticism about whether he would bring enough experience to the job of overseeing the markets less than two years after the crash.    Several other openings at the SEC would give Mr. Breeden a unique opportunity to help shape the agency if he is confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Breeden was nominated to fill the position of Charles Cox, whose term has expired. Mr. Ruder said he will leave by the end of September, and at least one more of the five commissioners will leave within a year. As well, the sensitive post of enforcement chief has been vacant since Gary Lynch left last month.    Colleagues and friends describe Mr. Breeden, a key thinker behind the massive savings and loan bailout legislation, as a conservative who generally favors deregulation and free-market approaches but who also believes there is a need for government to set and enforce rules in the marketplace.    &quot;Richard believes in markets, but he also believes government has an important role to play,&quot; said William Isaac, a former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &quot;It's always a balancing act. I think he has a preference to let the markets operate, particularly when it comes to {eliminating} barriers against competition.&quot; Mr. Breeden hasn't weighed in publicly on some key issues, such as whether the walls separating the banking and securities businesses should be torn down, but he gained a reputation as favoring deregulation when he shepherded a task force on financial regulation for then-Vice President Bush in the mid-1980s.    &quot;I haven't sensed any objection from him to banks playing a pretty significant role in the securities markets,&quot; said John Medlin, chairman of First Wachovia Corp. and a friend Mr. Breeden consulted on the task-force report.    But while the SEC has some role in deciding on the barriers between banking and securities activities, that largely is a legislative matter.    Mr. Breeden is best known for his experience as a private banking attorney from 1985 until he joined the White House staff this year. He was a key figure in the administration's effort to push the savings and loan bailout plan through Congress.    Yesterday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), said the committee will closely question Mr. Breeden's qualifications. The panel likely will hold hearings on the nomination in September.    Mr. Breeden &quot;did fine work on the Sandamp;L reform package and in other governmental assignments,&quot; Mr. Riegle said, &quot;yet he brings little direct market experience to this critical assignment, and that is a matter of some concern when the SEC faces a time of epic challenge.&quot;    Mr. Riegle said he would probe Mr. Breeden's &quot;market knowledge and experience as well as his view on such key issues as market reform, tender offers, leveraged buy-outs, insider trading, and program trading.&quot;    Wall Street was relieved that the months-long wait for a chairman was over. The Bush administration sent signals early this year that it wouldn't renominate Mr. Ruder, but it set aside the task of choosing a new chairman as it concentrated on the savings and loan bailout bill and a new plan to handle Third World debt.    &quot;I'm glad a chairman has been named,&quot; said Hardwick Simmons, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and the chairman of the Securities Industry Association. &quot;There's a lot of issues at stake: global competitiveness, global clearance and settlement issues, keeping up the good work&quot; in enforcement and attacking penny-stock fraud, he said.    Mr. Simmons also said Mr. Breeden's views on specific issues were unclear. Last month, Mr. Breeden met with a number of Wall Street executives, including Mr. Simmons, but didn't outline his philosophy. &quot;We simply wanted to get to know him,&quot; Mr. Simmons said. &quot;He was relatively unknown as far as our industry was concerned.&quot;    Some top aides to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady were cool to Mr. Breeden's selection, partly because they think he doesn't share the call for unified regulation of the financial markets made in Mr. Brady's 1988 report on the markets. They also think he doesn't have enough experience.    As it became clear in recent days that Mr. Breeden was a front-runner for the job -- along with Paul MacAvoy, an academician pushed by Mr. Brady -- Mr. Breeden began quietly trying to dispel the idea that he has solely been a banking lawyer.    Mr. Breeden, 39 years old, started his legal career in 1976 doing banking and securities work as a lawyer with the New York firm Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore. From 1982 to 1985 he was deputy counsel to Mr. Bush. In late 1985 he joined the Washington office of Baker andamp; Botts, a prominent law firm, whose founders included the great-grandfather of Secretary of State James Baker.    &quot;Richard is an eminent banking expert but also a well-trained securities lawyer,&quot; said James Doty, the senior securities lawyer at Baker andamp; Botts. &quot;He worked on hostile takeovers, underwritings and mergers.&quot;    Mr. Ruder said Mr. Breeden &quot;has a strong background in the areas of securities law and financial securities regulation. He is well suited to lead the commission in its important role as a national and international capital markets regulator.&quot;    It's expected that Mr. Breeden would have closer relations with the White House than Mr. Ruder, whose two-year reign was marked by some stormy differences with the Reagan Treasury. Mr. Ruder, for instance, distanced himself from the cautious suggestions of the Treasury's post-crash task force and suggested more interventionist measures.    &quot;Breeden has a high energy level and is very creative. When you combine those traits with his relationship with the president, I think you can expect an SEC chairman who will be very effective,&quot; said Mr. Isaac, the former FDIC chairman, who now runs Secura Group, a banking consulting firm.    At the White House since January, Mr. Breeden has been something of a crisis manager, taking time out from lobbying for the thrift bill to oversee administration policy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Mr. Breeden got his undergraduate degree at Stanford, where he was on the varsity sailing and tennis teams, and then went on to Harvard Law School. </TEXT></DOC>
