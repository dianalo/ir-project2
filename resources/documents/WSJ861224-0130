MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/24/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWSSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When it comes time to produce a TV miniseries about the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal, screenwriters will have a field day contrasting the prosecutor, Charles M. Carberry, with his polished multimillionaire adversaries.    Mr. Carberry is a corpulent man of medium height who wears baggy suits and a fretful look. When he speaks about the celebrated subjects of his latest case, he calls them &quot;meat-eaters,&quot; as in: &quot;For a long time in the insider-trading area people would say, 'You can only get low-level people. You couldn't get meat-eaters.' Well, now we got meat-eaters.&quot;    He's the son of a warehouse worker and the product of New York City's Catholic school system, and his closest brush with the inside of the securities business was a college summer job as a stockbroker's messenger. Today he runs the securities and commodities frauds unit in the Justice Department's southern district of New York, a job that makes him the federal government's top cop on Wall Street.    Mr. Carberry's insider-trading cases have set financiers and lawmakers thinking about whether sweeping changes are needed in the nation's financial markets. But he takes a simpler view of the scandal.    &quot;Insider trading is not a complex crime,&quot; Mr. Carberry says in a thick, throaty voice. &quot;It's theft. These guys are thieves. They steal information and then they fence it. It's no different than if they were stealing ice skates.&quot;    Mr. Carberry, 36 years old, took up his post last January, after six years of other assignments in the U.S. attorney's office here. He has a reputation as an obsessive investigator and a wily, often inscrutable negotiator.    &quot;He'll sit there sort of sphinx-like and nod, and give you 'yup,' 'nope' kind of answers,&quot; says an attorney who has watched Mr. Carberry in action. &quot;His public persona is phlegmatic, stone-faced and clipped. I think a lot of lawyers wind up coming away with an impression that he's a guy who can be taken advantage of -- which is a bad mistake.&quot;    &quot;He's a scary guy,&quot; says a former colleague. &quot;I'm sure an awful lot of the defendants he interviews are frightened, because he's big and he's a formidable presence across the desk.&quot;    Mr. Carberry dismisses such comments with an impatient wave of his hand. &quot;I'm not a rock star,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't particularly like to talk about myself.&quot;    The cases that are sending shock waves through Wall Street are taking shape behind a battered wooden desk in an old room filled with scratched file cabinets. Interspersed among legal texts on the bookshelves are a baseball encyclopedia and several murder mysteries. On one wall is a cartoon that reads &quot;An elephant never forgets,&quot; an apparent twin reference to Mr. Carberry's girth and his prosecutorial zeal.    As in other insider-trading cases, Mr. Carberry's task in the cases against Mr. Boesky and investment banker Dennis B. Levine has been to lead the government's criminal prosecution while the Securities and Exchange Commission pursued related civil charges.    Typically the SEC initiates such investigations, as it did in the Levine case after an anonymous letter to Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. from Venezuela led the agency to the Bahamian bank that was handling Mr. Levine's trading. Then the Justice Department moves in. It can bring criminal charges (the SEC can only press civil charges) using a battery of law-enforcement weapons.    Federal prosecutors can order arrests, wiretaps and searches. And they can make deals with defendants, agreeing to reduce charges in return for cooperation in a continuing probe.    In the past, Mr. Carberry has been known as a tough deal-maker, driven by an acute sense of right and wrong.    &quot;Charlie is imbued with the concept that justice must prevail,&quot; says William Hughes Mulligan, a former Appeals Court judge who hired Mr. Carberry out of Fordham Law School as a clerk.    &quot;He is often a hell of a lot tougher than one might wish,&quot; says a lawyer who has squared off against Mr. Carberry. &quot;Some people say he's been a prosecutor too long -- that he sees the world in black and white.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Carberry's plea-bargain arrangement with Mr. Boesky has been widely viewed as an unusually lenient deal. Mr. Boesky, who admitted to making $50 million in his insider trading, agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count carrying a potential prison term of one to five years. He also agreed to pay $100 million to settle SEC charges.    But lawyers who know Mr. Carberry say he and his boss, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, would never have given Mr. Boesky such treatment without being confident that the arbitrager's cooperation would lead to many more indictments.    &quot;Right now you just don't know the other side of the bargain,&quot; says Ira Lee Sorkin, who worked closely with Mr. Carberry as head of the SEC's New York office, a post he left in September. &quot;When they offered Boesky the deal, they knew what Boesky could help them on. I think it's fair to assume there will be lots of shoes dropping.&quot;    Mr. Carberry refuses to discuss the Boesky case. In general, he says of criticism: &quot;If you can't dispute the government's case, what you do is attack the government's prosecutor.&quot; About the prospects of future insider-trading bombshells, he has only one hint to offer: &quot;I think 1987 will be a very busy year for the securities unit.&quot;    Though Mr. Carberry, who is single, is known as a workhorse, he does have a few outside interests. His flair for deadpan, cutting humor has put him in regular demand to write scripts for office roasts. He once told a trade paper that he &quot;lives for the months of November to February,&quot; when he can watch the basketball team of his alma mater, St. John's University.    Before he came to the securities unit, he led some of the most important cases the government prosecuted in New York. In 1981 he convicted Michele Sindona, who died in Italy in March, of staging his own kidnapping as the Italian financier faced trial for fraud related to the collapse of Franklin National Bank. Two years ago he got convictions of four men in one of the biggest tax-fraud cases ever, the Sentinel Financial Instruments affair.    Mr. Carberry also argued the only insider-trading case the U.S. attorney's southern district has lost: the trial of Thomas C. Reed, a former special assistant to President Reagan for national security affairs. Mr. Reed, who served in the White House from 1982 to 1983, was acquitted last year of charges in connection with a stock-option trade he made in 1981 as a private investor. A character witness for Mr. Reed was Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, now a central figure in the Iran-Contra affair.    The pace of insider-trading cases was mounting when Mr. Carberry took over the securities unit. The southern district, where most such cases in the U.S. are brought, averaged two such prosecutions a year from 1978 to 1984. The average has leaped to 14 since then.    Mr. Carberry attributes the rise to a growing sophistication about how to prosecute insider trading and a growing body of precedent cases for prosecutors to cite. He also contends that the crime itself has grown more common, thanks to the merger boom of recent years and the growth of high-risk options trading.    He shrugs when asked to describe his methods in disentangling insider-trading schemes. &quot;You're not exactly talking about nuclear engineering here,&quot; he says. &quot;Usually it's one piece you're looking for, and everything else will fall into place. You're looking for a connection between the insider and the person who did the trading.    &quot;Prosecuting is no different from securities trading,&quot; he says. &quot;Information is the key.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
