Yet the May 19 broadcast from five locations around the country,estimated to cost at least $250,000, is being bankrolled by GOPAC,a fund-raising committee that helps Republican candidates.   ``There are references to ideas, but there are no references inthe entire show to either political party,'' Gingrich said in aninterview before Wednesday's announcement of the program.   Gingrich said he is trying to convince Americans of allpolitical stripes that ``the bureaucratic welfare state andpermissive attitudes'' are responsible for many of today's problems.   They must be replaced with ``a new model'' for government, hesaid, in which Americans solve problems by helping themselvesrather than relying on the government.   Gingrich said some Democrats, such as former Carteradministration Attorney General Griffin Bell and Polly Williams, amember of the Wisconsin legislature who once was on welfare, willjoin in the effort.   The program will originate from Gingrich's home district inGeorgia and will contain appearances by participants in four othercites. Some 500 workshops have been set up around the country, hesaid, where people will watch the program by satellite hookup anddebate the issues.   Gingrich long has worked to increase the ranks of Republicans inthe House, where they are outnumbered by Democrats 258 to 176. Buthe insisted the telecast, which may set the stage for a series ofsuch workshops, is not a party-building effort per se.   Gingrich said that if a Democrat such as Sen. Bill Bradley ofNew Jersey or Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia ``someday ends up aspresident on a platform made up of these kind of ideas ... that'sfine.''   ``Our goal is not the shape of the parties. It's the shape ofthe country,'' he said.   Gingrich acknowledged that while he will avoid preaching GOPgospel as such, the self-help appeal is designed to attractdisaffected Democrats and others from the nearly 50 percent of thevoting population that did not participate in the last presidentialelection.   ``It is true that a lot of Democrats, for ideological reasonsdon't feel comfortable being involved,'' Gingrich said. ``Becausein their party it wouldn't be positive to be involved in somethinglike this. But it seems to me that's a commentary on the DemocraticParty, not a commentary on what we're trying to do.''   Asked whether it was an effort to build the Republican Party,the ``nonpartisan'' label notwithstanding, he replied, ``Oh, sure.''   ``It is fair to say that it is part of a continuing effort ...to expand the Republican base,'' he said. ``But it is also fair tosay that, in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, that you becomeless partisan and more interested in serving.''</TEXT></DOC>
