Many non-EEC countries at a council meeting of the 96-nationGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade warned of dangers posed byunilateral trade curbs, with some criticizing the United States byname.   The council's regular session appeared to satisfy EEC hopes forwide condemnation of the U.S. countermeasures as a violation ofGATT's international trade rules, although the Common Market did notdemand a formal GATT inquiry into the dispute.   Top EEC and U.S. trade officials are expected to discuss theissue when they meet Feb. 18 in Brussels.   GATT director general Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland told delegatesthe trade accord contained nothing ``which could justifydiscriminatory import tariffs'' as a retaliatory move.   EEC delegate Tran Van-Thinh said the United States action camewithout GATT authority. He reiterated threats of EECcounter-retaliation against U.S. imports unless Washington withdrawsits measures. Tran also said U.S. policies endanger the global freetrading system.   U.S. envoy Michael Samuels said the meat hormones case was a``small crisis'' and that settlement efforts are continuing.   He also stated the U.S. position that scientific evidence doesnot suggest hormone-treated meat poses any health risks for Europeanconsumers, the reason the EEC cited in imposing its ban.   Japan expressed concern about unilateral trade moves, as didThailand, Switzerland, Argentina, Switzerland and Pakistan, andothers.   The EEC's import ban on hormone-treated meat took effect Jan. 1,affecting U.S. sales of beef and veal valued at more than $100million.   In response, Washington immediately slapped high duties onimports of European food products including boneless beef, ham andpork shoulders.   EEC foreign ministers on Jan. 23 then approved a plan to impose100 percent duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit. Butthe ministers delayed implementation to give more time forsettlement negotiations and said they would review the situationFeb. 20 before making a final decision on the matter.   The United States also came under pressure in other tradedisputes.   Brazil said it would demand a special council session to pressfor a GATT ruling on whether 100 percent U.S. tariffs on Braziliandrugs, paper products and consumer electronics violate trade rules.   The United States imposed the sanctions last year because it saidBrazilian laws insufficiently protect foreign pharmaceutical patents.   Samuels vetoed Brazil's second request for an investigation,noting the new Bush administration still is formulating its positionon the case. GATT traditionally operates by consensus.   Brazil was supported by some 50 countries, and a request for ameeting before the next regularly scheduled council March 8 appearedlikely to be accepted.   In another case, the United States blocked adoption of a reportby GATT investigators which found parts of a U.S. trade lawdiscriminate against foreign companies in U.S. patent infringementproceedings.   The EEC had asked for the inquiry. The report urges Washington tobring its legislation into line with GATT rules.   But Samuels said all delegations should study the complex reportfurther before taking any action on it.</TEXT></DOC>
