And I yield to noperson or party in my passion for freedom.''   Republicans, Bentsen said, ``have behaved as if the flag were apartisan and not a personal virtue.''   The Reagan administration has relied on ``extreme partisanshipand overheated campaign rhetoric instead of a patient, bipartisanapproach to national security issues,'' he said in a speech textreleased prior to delivery.   ``The simple truth is this: Gov. Dukakis is a veteran, apatriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,''Bentsen said. ``He can be trusted as a defender of Americansecurity _ and as a champion of American values.''   Bentsen was well received personally, receiving standingovations when he arrived and when he left. But he was interruptedby boos four times, three times when he mentioned Dukakis; oncewhen he referred to former President Carter.   Stopped by booing after he said that Carter had begun thedefense build-up, he told the crowd: ``Pretty hard for some of youto accept that.''   After the speech, Bentsen said he thought there had been someorganized opposition to the speech. Republicans, he said, ``weredesperate to find an issue.''   Bentsen cited Dukakis' emphasis on improving non-nuclearweapons, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, support of the Stealthbomber and a new submarine-launched missile. Dukakis, he said,would manage military spending more effectively.   While praising his running mate, Bentsen blasted both VicePresident George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., for supportingcuts in veterans health care programs.   While avoiding direct criticism of Quayle for serving in theNational Guard during the Vietnam War, Bentsen's highlighting ofhis own military record was an indirect swipe.   ``I think that the breadth of experience that I've had, and thetests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to meearly on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast,'' the Texassenator said Wednesday in a speech to the Southern LegislativeConference, a group of state legislators he said included manyReagan Democrats.   He suggested that Quayle lacked the maturity needed to lead thecountry, a requirement of someone who would be vice president.   Bentsen's speech today to the Veterans of Foreign Warsconvention in Chicago is three days after Vice President GeorgeBush and Quayle addressed the group. One of the objectives ofBentsen's speech was to contest the GOP contention that theDemocrats are weak on defense, campaign aides said.   His speech was drafted with the help of Dukakis speechwriters soit would be in harmony with an address the Massachusetts governorplans to deliver in early September before the American Legion.   More conservative than Dukakis on defense issues, Bentsen hassupported aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the MX Missile andthe B-1 bomber. Dukakis opposes those policies, but Bentsen hasbeen trying to highlight areas where the two men agree, such asstrengthening conventional forces and more effective management ofthe Pentagon.   After the VFW speech and a luncheon in Chicago, Bentsen wasscheduled to attend a veterans' celebration at a county fair inTrenton, Tenn.   In stepping up his criticism of Quayle, Bentsen has begun citingthe Indiana senator's voting record on veterans bills.   Among those is Quayle's vote against creating a Cabinet-levelveterans department _ a position Quayle reversed before the VFWearlier this week with the explanation that his earlier positionwas ``youthful indiscretion.''   ``A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred onlyfive weeks ago,'' Bentsen said. ``I don't think America can riskyouthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president atany moment.''   Bentsen spent Wednesday night in Milwaukee, where he took a boatride up the Milwaukee River and visited a sausage factory store.   Bentsen had planned to complete a four-day campaign swingFriday, but it has been extended to allow Bentsen a day in Texas atweek's end at the same time Bush is campaigning there. Both menclaim Texas as their home state.</TEXT></DOC>
