 One group, those who make and market uninterruptible powersupplies, share the obsession of creating a fog of technobabble surroundingtheir products.andM;In their literature, the UPS companies bury you in brownouts, whip you withwaveforms, and petrify you with power factors.andP;  Many people who need anuninterruptible power supply are frightened off by the conflicting buzz oftechnical phrases, claims, and concepts that UPS vendors wrap around theirproducts.andP;  No other part of the computer market threatens you with such totaldisaster if you don't select the right product.andM;Local area networks need the support of uninterruptible power supplies; everynetwork file server absolutely requires power backup.andP;  If you use the new10BaseT twisted-pair wiring scheme, you must provide backup power for thewiring hubs too.andP;  Extended networks with bridges and routers need powerbackup to avoid systemic failures.andP;  Smart network administrators also knowthey must supply backup power for LAN client stations because it does userslittle good to have an operational server and wiring system if their PCs godown before they can save their spreadsheets and word processing files.andM;In this review, PCLAN Labs evaluates 27 products from 23 UPS vendors,including Acme Electric Safe Power, Alpha Technologies, American PowerConversion, Asiatek, Clary, Computer Accessories, DRS Power Products, DurantTechnologies, Emerson Computer Power, EPE Technologies, Exide Electronics,IntelliPower, ITT PowerSystems, Panamax, Para Systems, PC Power andamp; Cooling,Perma Power, SCI DataShield, Sola Electric, Taesung Industries, Tripp Lite,Unison Technologies, and Upsonic.andM;TOO MUCH PROTECTIONandM;The PC Magazine LAN Labs crew faced the UPS technobabble blizzard and dugthrough the storm of claims to uncover one valuable fact: most people pay forfar too much UPS protection.andM;We found that today's PCs have robust and durable power supplies able tosurvive an amazing gauntlet of brownouts and interruptions without faltering.andO;In PC LAN Labs we ran PCs for days at 90 volts, a much lower voltage than anytypical brownout, without heating their power supplies or making them suffera single operational problem.andP;  We shorted the power lines of dozens ofdifferent PCs for a hundred milliseconds without causing a single failure.andO;Considering the quality of the PC you'll likely choose as a LAN server, youdon't have to pay for brownout protection or superfast UPS response time.andM;Many UPS companies spend a lot of effort to convince you that pure sine wavepower works better for PC power supplies than other waveforms.andP;  Some deviceswith older-technology power supplies or motors running directly from the ACline do run better on sine waves, but modern PCs thrive on square waves,trapezoidal waves or any other kind of alternating current waves you feedthem.andP;  However, if you plan to back up printers with a UPS, the circuitry inmany printers clearly prefers pure sine waves to their more-jagged cousins.andM;Frankly, while most of the claims and specifications broadcast by UPS vendorsare important to purists, they shouldn't concern someone who wants backuppower for a modern network server.andP;  Buyers need to know two things: First,will the UPS power the network servers through most outages; and, second,will the UPS tell the servers it's about to run out of juice and initiate anorderly shutdown of the system?andM;HOW LONG IS LONG ENOUGH?andM;Two separate studies conducted by IBM and Bell Laboratories looked at thetype and nature of power disturbances.andP;  The studies revealed that more thanhalf of all power disturbances last less than 6 seconds; they also found thatpower disturbances occur on the average of twice week for most commercialsites.andP;  Types of disturbances included sags, surges, failures, oscillations,and spikes (see the sidebar &quot;Spikes, Surges, and Other Power Gremlins&quot;).andM;Power outages fall into two categories: a few minutes and a few hours.andO;Outages lasting a few minutes take place when something--a lightning strike,an unfortunate squirrel, or a wayward mylar balloon--creates a power lineoverload that trips a circuit breaker.andP;  Since these circuit breakers possessautomatic reset capabilities, they can work from the surrounding power gridinto the source of the short to reestablish power within seconds or minutes.andM;Outages of several hours' duration take place when something--a car crashinginto a power pole, a fire, or high winds--physically disrupts the powertransmission system.andP;  This kind of outage typically lasts for hours or untilrepair crews can restore service.andM;If you require absolutely uninterrupted power, even during outages lastingfor several hours, then you need a generator to supplement your UPS, not anextremely large UPS.andP;  But if you just wish to survive the typicalshort-duration interruption and have time to gracefully shut down the systemwhen short outages become long outages, then you only need a few minutes ofUPS power.andP;  All of the UPS units we tested--even the relatively tiny 13-poundPC-Might 35 from Upsonic--can support a heavily equipped IBM PS/2 Model 80for more than 10 minutes.andP;  Several units ran the server for more than anhour.andM;HOW BIG IS BIG ENOUGH?andM;The problem of buying the right-size UPS puzzles many people.andP;  Most UPSmanufacturers mark their products in terms of volt-amperes (VA).andP;  However,computer manufacturers typically list the power consumption of their productsin watts.andP;  Conversion between watts and volt-amps involves a semimysticalnumber called a power factor (see the sidebar &quot;What's Watt?&quot; to dispel themystery).andM;In simplest terms, no single PC acting as a server is likely to consume morethan 300 watts, even if you include the attached monitor.andP;  Since a number ofUPS products cluster in the 400 volt-amp range, you'll find plenty ofproducts that can power a network file server.andP;  You don't need to buy a UPSwith 800 or 1,200 volt-amps to power a server and its monitor.andP;  Since the UPSand the server interact, you'll want one UPS per server instead of trying topower a group of servers from a single, larger UPS.andM;INSIDE THE UPSandM;The typical UPS consists of a set of batteries, a battery charger, and apower inverter.andP;  The inverter does the job of converting the relatively low,direct-current voltage of the batteries into the typical 117 volts ofalternating current normally supplied by the power line.andP;  It's difficult toproduce pure sine-wave power from an inverter because an inverter createsalternating current by switching the direct current from the batteries on andoff quickly.andP;  Changing these pulses into pure sine waves takes a lot ofcircuitry.andP;  The battery charger keeps the batteries in peak condition duringnormal operation from the power line.andM;Simply stated, big batteries let UPS systems provide more power for a longerperiod of time.andP;  The amount of output power and the output duration increaseor decrease in an inverse ratio.andP;  All the UPS products tested by PC LAN Labsuse sealed, maintenance-free batteries.andP;  Like ordinary automobile batteries,the batteries are all based on some form of lead-acid technology, oftenincorporating a gelled electrolyte for added safety so that the activechemical agent doesn't spill or vent hazardous fumes.andM;UPS products differ primarily in the power storage capacity of the batteries,the power delivery capability of the inverter, the waveform output of theinverter, and whether the inverter operates all the time or only when theinput voltage reaches a specific low or high level.andP;  Full-time systemsrequire robust components and designs and therefore cost more money.andP;  Minordifferences between products include the indicators they provide to signalthe status of battery life and power load and the aural and visual alarmsthey use to alert you to problems.andM;WHAT'S IN A NAME?andM;Not all UPS products work the same.andP;  Most of the low-cost products act asstandby power systems (SPS).andP;  They monitor the power line and, if a problemoccurs, switch in the inverter, powered by their batteries.andP;  The time neededto switch from power line to battery-supplied power, called the transfertime, can take just a few milliseconds.andP;  Meanwhile, the power supplies inmodern PCs can coast for at least a hundred milliseconds without causing asystem failure.andM;The on-line UPS design, typically more expensive, constantly supplies powerfrom the inverter while the batteries continue charging from the the AC powerline.andP;  No spikes or noise pulses from the power line get to the supported PCbecause the inverter supplies freshly generated alternating current.andP;  Whenthe AC line faults, the battery smoothly supplies power to the inverter.andP;  Theprotected device never sees a millisecond of outage, and the transfer time isnil.andM;Some of the products we tested appear to be on-line systems because they canadjust to low voltages without switching to battery backup, but, like SPSs,they don't run their inverters all the time.andP;  These devices use aferroresonant transformer design that regenerates the sine wave for a morestable voltage and an output free of distortions.andP;  The Alpha Technologies650FR, Taesung's UPS-10000, and Sola Electric's Sidekick 520 World Model useferroresonant designs to offer excellent line-filtering capability withvirtually no switching time.andP;  These systems fall into a hybrid UPS category.andM;SERVER COMMUNICATIONandM;The UPS supporting a network server must communicate with the server and warnit to close files and shut down when its battery power nears its end.andP;  MostUPS-to-LAN interface programs also report when the server starts to run onbattery power and notify any network client stations fortunate enough stillto be up and running after the outage.andM;Apart from the necessary power cord connection, the method of connecting theUPS to the server varies.andP;  Most vendors supply you with an appropriateinterconnecting cable and software on request so that you can monitor theUPS.andP;  The biggest question comes when you decide what kind of cable andsoftware you need for your hardware and operating system combinations.andM;OPERATING SYSTEM CONNECTIONSandM;If you use and IBM PS/2 compaq with a built-in mouse port and run the NovellNetWare operating system, you need only a cable for the connection.andP;  NetWare286 and 386 both support UPS monitoring through the mouse port on thesemachines.andP;  And if your use an ISA bus machine and already have a Novell diskcontroller board, a Novell key card, or a Novell UPS interface card in yourserver, you need only a cable.andP;  Each of these Novell products includes aconnection for a UPS interface cable.andM;Many UPS manufacturers use the same method of connecting to and communicatingwith a Novell server through an RS-232 serial port.andP;  A company named OceanIsle Software (Ocean Isle Square, Bldg.andP;  3, Ocean Isle Beach, NC 28459; (800)882-8664, (919) 579-8728) has almost cornered the UPS value-added softwaremarket.andP;  Its $99 product, the Network Monitor, works with 22 of the 26systems we tested.andP;  Ocean Isle markets both a Value Added Process (VAP) forNovell's Advanced NetWare 286 and a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) for NetWave386.andP;  A VAP or NLM runs as a separate task in the NetWare server andinteracts with the server software.andM;Microsoft's LAN Manager uses an RS-232 port to communicate with a UPS, alongwith a UPs service included in the package that runs with it over OS/2.andP;  Whenit detects a power failure, the server executes a pause to prevent any newconnections.andP;  Users automaticlly receive a broadcast message notifying themof the power outage at the server.andP;  After a specified amount of time, the UPSservice warns users to end their sessions and displays a message at theserver advising that all sessions be closed.andM;If the LAN Manager server receives a low-battery signal or if the batterytime set into the software expires, the server software informs all users ofthe server's pending shutdown.andP;  Then LAN Manager runs a batch file, selectedby the system administrator, to close or exit running applications.andP;  Thisbatch file needs 30 seconds to complete its operations before the servershuts down.andP;  After an orderly shutdown, LAN Manager notifies the UPS to stopsending power to the server to save batteries.andP;  When utility power cames backon, the server does a cold boot and begins normal operation.andM;Among the other available network operating systems, Banyan VINES and othersystems based on UNIX and DEC's VMS all have UPS software that monitors theserial port.andP;  However, DOS-based LAN operating systems don't typically inclueUPS interfaces, primarily because of the difficulty of closing open files atthe server under DOS.andM;UL LISTINGandM;Underwriters Laboratory, better known as UL, has a safety standard coveringuninterruptible power supply equipment.andP;  Most but not all of the products wetested received UL approval.andP;  In Canada, the Canadian Standards Association(CSA) performs the same function.andM;UL standard 1778 describes exactly what a UPS is and does.andP;  UL testingstresses the safety of products, and only products that passed specific ULtesting procedures can carry the UL seal.andP;  Many state and federal agenciesand private corporations require products they buy to carry UL approval.andP;  Webelieve that UL or CSA approval should count as an important factor toconsider when you buy a UPS.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;In this review we examine products capable of protecting an IBM PS/2 Model 80server, a pair of 300MB Core hard disks, and a monochrome VGA monitor.andP;  Werequested vendors to send us their best product to protect this type ofsystem.andP;  If they sell both an on-line and an SPS type of product, we toldthen we would review one of each kind.andM;Since we intended to test these products on a network file server, we askedthe vendors to provide the appropriate cables and software for an interfacebetween the UPS and server.andP;  Our PS/2 Model 80 ran Version 3.1 of NetWare386, and we kept available an IBM PC At running NetWare 286 to test anyvendor's Advanced NetWAre 286 value-added process.andM;A total of 23 vendors responded with a product.andP;  Two vendors were not able toparticipate: Volta Diagnostic Systems did not have products ready to ship intime for us to test them, and Best Power Technology declined our invitationto participate.andP;  Meirick Inc. (Box 298, Frisco, CO 80443, (303) 668-3251),contacted us too late to be included.andM;WHAT WE TESTEDandM;For this review we focus on how well the products perform their designatedtasks.andP;  We considered the main tasks to be riding out a power outage of atleast 10 minutes and shutting down the server when batery voltage failed.andO;Added features such as remote turn-on, battery health monitoring, remotedialing to notify the network administrator of a power outage, and a sleepmode to conserve battery life enhance the value of a product.andM;In the not-too-distant past, buyers judged UPS products mainly by the amountsystem during a blackout.andP;  This computer system during a blackout.andP;  This ledto heavy and bulky products with large batteries.andP;  The trend in the UPSmarket hs turned to lower-cost and shorter-battery-duration products.andP;  Withthe advent of software that can gracefully shut down the server, you don'tgain much from the extra time larger batteries provide.andM;One feature most SPS manufacturers like to brag about pertains to transfertime--in other words, how fast the SPS takes over in the event of a problem.andO;Before connecting any UPS products, we decided first to measure thesensitivity of computers to interruptions caused by shorts.andP;  A short in thePC's power supply plug creates the most typical power interrupt condition.andO;During our test, we used an interrupt generator capable of shorting the powersupply plug for a preset amount of time: 100 milliseconds, calibrated with anoscilloscope.andP;  The systems we tested included an IBM PC AT, an IBM PS/2 Model80, and several different Dell, ALR, NCR, ATandamp;T, and Compaq PCs.andP;  Whilerunning a disk drive test, none of the dozens of different PCs in our Labseven blinked at a 100-millisecond shorted line interrupt.andM;Our test indicates it would be pointless to measure the exact transfer timeof each SPS product.andP;  If you're using a computer from one of the leadingmanufacturers, any SPS capable of switching in 10 milliseconds or less ismore than adequate.andP;  You don't need to pay extra money for 1-millisecondtransfer times.andP;  In our UPS performance tests, we checked to make sure that aUPS responded to 5 and 25-millisecond power line interruption by going tobattery operation.andP;  A 25-millisecond response time should protect any modernserver.andM;Testing the time a UPS can hold the computer up after power goes out is easy.andO;You only need a stopwatch and access to the power cord.andP;  However, not allpower outages look like someone has pulled the plug.andP;  Most outages actuallylook like a short has been placed across the AC power line.andP;  We shorted theline, started our watches, and monitored the communications between theserver and UPS.andM;We decided not to test the surge capacity of the UPS products.andP;  If a UPS hasreceived Underwriters Laboratory approval, it would have passed UL testsalready.andP;  And if it didn't have UL approval, we didn't want to carry surgetesting through to its sometimes destructive end.andM;The robust operation of PC power supplies during a power interruptionprompted us to perform a similar test for low-voltage operation.andP;  We hookedup a variable transformer between the computer power plug and the walloutlet, allowing us to vary the AC voltage from 0 to 140 volts.andP;  We testedeach of the PCs by decreasing the voltage and watching for the power supplyto quit.andP;  All of the PCs we could find operated below 80 volts, and mostdidn't fail until the input voltage dropped to 75 volts.andP;  (The monitors,however, became unusable below about 90 volts.)andP;  Since severe brownouts mightreduce AC supply voltages in the U.S.andP;  to somewhere around 110 volts, fewpeople should worry about buying brownout protection.andP;  PC power suppliesappear to operate smoothly at 90 volts and below, and countries such as Japanroutinely use 100-volt input power.andM;THE BOTTOM LINEandM;Clearly, you should buy UPS protection for every network server, wiring hub,and bridge or router on the network.andP;  Since you don't need to buy excessivelylarge and expensive products, you can afford to back up many networked clientPCs, too.andP;  Using a few criteria such as UL approval, the right networkinterface, and appropriate sizing, you can confidently ignore thetechnobabble and choose from among many fine products in the market.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;* Smart-UPS 400andM;* Unison PS 6.0andM;The Smart-UPS 400 from American Power Conversion gets our vote for the bestsystem in the standby category.andP;  A simple design coupled with added featureslike a battery replace light make it a perfect system for a small server.andP;  Atwo-year warranty and support for all the major network operating systemsassure that it will meet all the UPS needs of most networks.andM;The Unison PS 6.0, from Unison Technologies, wins the best of the rest award.andO;The PS 6.0 provides continuous, on-line backup at a price rivaling some ofthe standby-type units.andP;  Added features like an emergency keyboard lightmight come in handy in a power outage to keep you from groping in the darkfor the function keys.andP;  Innovative design does a lot to distinguish thisproduct from the rest.andM;Honorable mention goes to the Proxima IPS 500 Plus from Computer Accessories.andO;This unit had the best front-panel design we looked at and would workespecially nicely on a server doubling as a user workstation.andP;  The UpsonicPC-Might 35 wins the award for least expensive device with a UL listing.andM;SPIKES, SURGES,andM;AND OTHER POWER GREMLINSandM;Has your network experienced a close encounter with lightning or some otherpower surge?andP;  Such occurrences could cause damage to your system ranging fromthe loss of open files to the ruin of costly equipment.andP;  Each type of powersurge or loss has its own name based on its characteristics: the amount ofvoltage it imposes on the power lines, and its duration times.andM;For example, the term spike or impulse refers to an overvoltage,super-imposed on the line voltage waveform, lasting between 0.5 and 100microseconds and possessing an amplitude over 100 percent of peak linevoltage.andP;  What does this mean?andP;  Basically, it means your power line has beenstruck with a short-duration but powerful hit of at least 240 volts.andM;You can spot a surge on the power line when the voltage reaches above 110percent of the nominal value.andP;  A surge lasts only seconds, but this type ofdisturbance accounts for nearly all hardware damage experienced by smallcomputer users.andP;  You will find most computer power supplies cannot handle 260volts for any length of time.andM;Other possible power disturbances include sags and oscillations.andP;  A sag, orbrownout, occurs when the power line voltage falls below 80 percent of thenominal value and lasts several secconds.andP;  An oscillation, also referred toas noise, is a secondary signal on top of the 60-Hz waveform with a magnituderanging from 15 to 100 percent of the nominal line voltage.andM;Most UPS systems include some type of surge protection circuitry to protectthe host computer system from spikes and surges.andP;  The most common method theyuse today is a metal oxide varistor (MOV).andP;  This device protects theequipment by diverting excess voltages to ground.andP;  However, recent researchat the National Institute of Standards and Technology indicates that thecommonly used divert-to-ground scheme can still result in dataline glitchesor een damaged equipment.andM;Most often, the ground causes the problem.andP;  By ground we don't mean theearth's soil, but the green wire in your power outlet.andP;  The ground may atfirst seem like the perfect place to dump all the excess voltage caused by asurge or spike.andP;  But because it's the reference point for data going into andout of the server, it's not ideal for this purpose.andM;By dumping lage quantities of voltage onto this common ground, you create alarge voltage differential between the server and its client station.andP;  Theresult?andP;  Data loss or fried input circuits occur on the remote computers andprinters exposed to the redirected surge.andP;  Another limitation stems from theMOVhs limited in-service lifetime, which depends upon heat, usage, and otherfactors.andP;  An MOV lasts two years at best.andP;  But there are solutions, however.andM;One solution to th is problem comes from the patented Surge Eliminator, madeby Zero Surge Inc. of Barnardsville, New Jersey.andP;  Zero Surge's productincludes inique circuitry designed to absorb surges and spikes and releasethem back to the neutral wire slowly.andP;  By installing Zero Surge's SurgeEliminator between the wall plug and the UPS, you can let it eliminate surgesbefore the UPS protection circuitry can divert them to the ground wire.andM;WHAT'S WATT?andM;The first problem you run into when trying to buy a UPS is understanding howthe manufacturer labels the power-handling capability of the product.andP;  ManyUPS manufacturers give their power capacity rating in terms of volt-amperes,or VA.andP;  Most PC vendors rate the consumption of their products in amps or inwatts.andP;  If a vendor gives a PC's rating only in amps, then calculate watts bymultiplying 117 volts by the amps rating.andP;  For example, a 60-watt light bulbdraws about half an amp of power at 117 volts and dissipates it all in heatand light.andM;But, because of complex circuitry, some devices appear to draw more powerthan they dissipate.andP;  The ratio of the real of dissipated power to theapparent power is called the power factor of the circuit.andP;  The power factorof a purely resistive circuit like a light bulb is 1.andM;But the more-complex power supply in a PC contains certain inefficienciesthat give it a power factor rating between 0.6 and 0.7.andP;  If a UPSmanufacturer were to rate its product in watts, a UPS rated for 100 wattswould provide approximately 150 VA to a computer type of load.andP;  To pt itanother way, if you take the wattage rating privided by the manufacturer ofyour PC and simply select a UPS with the same numberic rating in volt-amps,you'll have a good reserve margin of support.andM;The term crest factor gets the prize for second most misunderstood in the UPSmarketplace.andP;  This obscure phrase characterizes the am ount of peak currentneeded by a computerhs power supply.andP;  The crest factor depends on the type ofinput AC waveform.andP;  For a true sine-wave source, a computer will exhibit acrest factor of 2 to 3.andP;  A modified sine-wave source will cause a computer toexhibit a crest factor of 1 to 1.5.andM;Some UPS vendors report the crest factor of their products.andP;  Practically, acrest factor of 2 or more, under the UPS's full rated load, will adequatelysupport a typical server.andP;  For the most part, you simply don't have to worryabout it.andM;When shopping for a UPS you must purchase a product with a power rating largeenough to handle whatever you plug into it.andP;  We recommend using one UPS perPC and monitor.andM;If you must also backup devices like printers, then you'll want a separateUPS with a pure sine-wave output.andP;  Most UPS manufacturers will tell you whattype of waveform their product produces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
