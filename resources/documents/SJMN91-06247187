Gueffroy was killed; Gaudian was seriously wounded. Gaudianlater was sentenced to three years in prison for attempting to flee thecountry but was released after the collapse of the East German communistregime.;   If convicted, the four defendants would face maximum 15-year prisonsentences. They have pleaded not guilty, stating that they were merelyfollowing the orders of their superiors.;   Although the shooting brought agroundswell of outrage in West Germany at the time, the mood Monday was moreof curiosity as the four men, all ages 26 or 27, entered the courtroom withheads bowed, looking lost and uncertain.;   Many Germans have expressedfrustration that the first to go on trial for such shootings were the soldiersrather than their superiors. Acknowledging this mood, Berlin judicialofficials stressed that they also were pursuing others farther up the chain ofcommand.;   They, along with other legal experts, believe the outcome of thecase against the four border guards is almost certain to influence legalactions under way against about 300 members of the former communist state,including former party boss Erich Honecker, onetime Prime Minister Willi Stophand former Defense Minister Heinz Kessler.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Berlin  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  26C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  423  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247187,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
