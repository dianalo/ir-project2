The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out the1985 suit against Universal Pictures and its parent MCA Inc.   Newman and Hill contended that Universal and other major moviestudios illegally conspired in the early 1980s to hold downartificially the profits paid to actors and directors from videosales and rentals.   The lawsuit said that as a result Newman and Hill did notreceive their fair share of the profits from two movies made yearsearlier, ``The Sting'' and ``Slapshot.''   Both men had signed ``profit participation agreements'' givingthem a percentage of all income received for showing the movies.   U.S. District Judge James Ideman dismissed the suit, ruling thatNewman and Hill had suffered no antitrust injury.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal lastyear.   ``The fundamental problem is that Newman and Hill entered intocontracts ... between 1972 and 1976, before the alleged conspiracyarose,'' the appeals court said. ``The subsequent conspiracy couldnot have affected the competition for Newman and Hill's services atthe time the contracts were made.''   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Newman and Hill calledthe appeals court ruling ``bizarre.''   ``How is it possible that a direct victim of a horizontalprice-fixing conspiracy does not suffer antitrust injury?'' theappeal asked.   The case is Newman vs. Universal Pictures, 87-1617.</TEXT></DOC>
