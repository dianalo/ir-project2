A year ago, the eight judges were suspended from the bench afterthe allegations of taking cash surfaced during an FBI racketeeringinvestigation of the Roofers Union.   Chief Justice Robert N.C. Nix Jr. said taking cash from theunion affected the judges' impartiality and ordered that thejudges' salaries, roughly $80,000 a year, cease immediately.   Only one judge denied receiving the cash; the others said theyconsidered the money a gift, not a bribe.   The judges had collected their salaries and benefits while thePennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board considered thecases. Last August, the board recommended removal from the bench.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, holding that ``a public trusthas been betrayed,'' concurred unanimously Thursday in a 43-pageopinion.   District Attorney Ronald Castille hailed the decision.   ``It is a strong message to judges everywhere that this kind ofconduct is totally inappropriate. This is an important first stepin rebuilding the citizen's confidence (to) get justice back inCity Hall,'' he said.   Mark A. Aronchick, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge Mary RoseFante Cunningham who was permanently removed from the bench, saidCunningham was ``just saddened about the whole thing.''   James C. Schwartzman, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge MichaelWallace who was permanently removed, said the penalty was far toosevere.   Stephen P. Gallagher, a lawyer for Municipal Judge ThomasDempsey who was barred from completing his term, said he had nottalked with his client, ``but I'm sure he'll be unhappy.''   And Charles Cunningham, a lawyer for Common Pleas Judge WilliamPorter who was barred for the rest of his term, said the court haddrawn a ``significant distinction'' with its sentence for Porterand Dempsey, since they will be allowed to try to return to thebench in the future.   The case and other bribery scandals, in which three judges havebeen convicted, have rocked the Philadelphia court system in thepast year.   Six other judges, also suspended last year, are underinvestigation.   The eight judges were accused of accepting $200 to $500 from1983 to 1985 from Stephen Traitz Jr., former leader of RoofersUnion Local 30-30B.   Traitz and 18 other union members were convicted last year ofextortion and bribery. They had been accused of trying to bribemore than 50 public officials.</TEXT></DOC>
