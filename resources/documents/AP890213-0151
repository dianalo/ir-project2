The commentary, carried by the Palestinian news agency WAFA,responded to remarks by U.S. Secretary of States James Baker toreporters over the weekend in Iceland.   The remarks appeared to be a warning that attacks by Palestinianguerrillas against Israeli civilians or soldiers, either inside oroutside Israel, could threaten the newly established U.S.-PLOdialogue.   Israeli soldiers killed five PLO guerrillas during a clash insouth Lebanon on Feb. 4. Israel said the guerrillas were trying toinfiltrate and that the PLO had not abandoned attacks on Israelitargets. It urged the United States to break off its dialogue withthe PLO, which opened in Tunis on Dec. 16 after chairman YasserArafat renounced terrorism.   The WAFA commentary accused Baker of trying to impose a doublestandard, ``prohibiting to the Palestinian people what it allowedthe Afghan resistance.''   ``The PLO is not resorting to terrorism, but resistance,'' thecommentary said. ``It is Israel that is practicing terrorism everyday while the Palestinian people are organizing legitimateresistance against the occupation, thus exercising a right inconformance with international law and convention.''   The commentator told Baker not to try to get the PLO to ``abandonthe resistance in order to be able to continue the U.S.-PLOdialogue.''   ``We engaged in this dialogue with the aim of finding a justsolution to the Palestinian problem and to realize the inalienablerights of this people,'' the commentary said.   ``The resistance and the uprising will stop only when it hasachieved its legitimate rights, including that of creating aPalestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.''</TEXT></DOC>
