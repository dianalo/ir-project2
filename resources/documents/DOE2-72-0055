<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-72-0055 </DOCNO><TEXT>Inclusive alpha particle and deuteron spectra from collisions of 156 MeV/sup 6/Li-ions with /sup 12/C and /sup 208/Pb were measured at extremeforward emission angles including zero degree. The measurements wereperformed with the Karlsruhe magnetic spectrograph 'Little John' andrequired an efficient reduction of the background from small-angle scattering.The observed double differential cross sections and angular distributionshave been analysed on the basis of Serber's spectator break-up model.When going to angles smaller than grazing, where Coulomb effects areexpected to be dominating, transitional features may appear. Correspondingeffects probably associated with Coulomb break-up are observed with the/sup 208/Pb-target and require a slight extension of the Serber approach.In the case of the /sup 12/C-target the break-up cross sections in forwarddirection seem to reflect the shape of the internal momentum distributionof the alpha particle and deuteron cluster in the /sup 6/Li-projectileand are in agreement with a 2S-type wave function. However, at largerangles the shape appears to be distorted, possibly by final state interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
