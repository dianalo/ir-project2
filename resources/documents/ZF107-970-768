(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fonts are no longer a topic for esoteric discussion among the cognoscenti;they are big news and big business.andP;  In 1989 fonts became an integral part ofcomputer operating systems and a major force in the desktop revolution.andM;In the surprise move of the year, Apple left its old ally Adobe Systems Inc.andO;of Mountain View, Calif., and smoothed over its differences with MicrosoftCorp. of Redmond, Wash., to join forces on new font and printingtechnologies.andP;  Apple's font format (code-named Royal) will be part ofMicrosoft's OS/2, while Microsoft's PostScript-clone interpreter will be usedin future Apple printers.andM;This announcement, made the day before the Seybold Computer PublishingConference andamp; Exposition opened in September, represents a threat to thedominance of PostScript and the security of Adobe.andP;  It has thrown the fontworld into confusion over the compatibility of existing fonts and printerswith future products.andM;Don't drop that drawer of type.andP;  &quot;A lot of our users are calling to try toget us to explain [Royal],&quot; said Chuck Surprise, general manager of CentralGraphics in San Diego and vice president of the Professional PostScriptAlliance.andP;  &quot;The uncertainty over what Apple will have with its new fonttechnology is already weighing on people trying to make buying decisions.andO;They're hearing that it might be better or it might be incompatible.&quot;andM;For its part, Apple is trying to reassure everyone that System 7.0, includingRoyal, will be fully backward-compatible.andP;  &quot;If you install System 7.0 and youdon't do anything else, everything will continue to work just as it doesnow,&quot; said Jim Gable, Apple's font product manager.andP;  &quot;For a new Macintoshowner, fonts are much simpler.&quot;andM;However, Mac owners with exist-ing font libraries will have to convert toRoyal fonts to take advantage of System 7.0's new capabilities.andP;  Theseinclude on-screen font scaling, better printing and an end to separatebit-map font files.andM;In alphabetical order.andP;  For all the troubling significance of theApple/Microsoft announcement, it doesn't change the current state of fonts.andO;The major event of the year with immediate impact is the introduction ofAdobe Type Manager.andM;ATM does for the Mac screen what the PostScript interpreter does on theprinted page; it scales font outlines on the fly.andP;  It is limited to Type 1fonts but not just PostScript printers.andP;  Even Gable admitted, &quot;ATM is a niceutility that lets people see why outline fonts are important.&quot;andM;Even though Apple would like to downplay ATM, there will be a lot of Macswith ATM before System 7.0 is released.andP;  &quot;We're shipping ATM, and it'sselling like crazy,&quot; said John Warnock, president of Adobe.andP;  &quot;We want ourtypeface format to survive.andP;  Post-Script is very strongly entrenched andbecoming more so.andP;  There aren't really any viable alternatives.andP;  When System7.0 comes out we will be ready with an enhanced, compatible version of ATM.&quot;andM;Lance Hidy, a member of Adobe's typographic advisory board and also awell-known illustrator, typographer and consultant to the computer industry,said, &quot;I think ATM is the most exciting thing to happen on my computer intypography in a long time.&quot;andM;The continued success of ATM could jeopardize the future of Royal.andP;  Manytypographers and graphic artists have already invested heavily in fonts andtechnology and don't want to support a second standard.andP;  &quot;System 7.0 fontswill make designers either laugh or be infuriated,&quot; Hidy said.andP;  &quot;If Appletold me specifically what is better about System 7.0, I'd be willing to beconvinced.andP;  If Apple's competition means that Adobe works faster to clean upproblems, that will be helpful.andP;  But if it means that service bureaus have tosupport two incompatible, relatively equivalent formats, then I see a lot ofheadaches.&quot;andM;Hidy may get what he's asking for.andP;  There are already some good reviews fromexperts who have been privy to Apple's secrets.andP;  &quot;Its font format goes waybeyond any spec I've seen,&quot; said Mike Parker, president of The Company ofBoston.andP;  &quot;It's incredibly good.andP;  [Apple] really listened to the artists whowere type designers, and for the first time it put everything in.andP;  But itssuccess depends on time more than anything else.andP;  [Royal] has the promise ofdoing more than any composing machine the world has ever seen.&quot;andM;Not quite hot off the presses.andP;  Adobe is shipping ATM but, like Apple, won'tpublish the specifications of its font format until sometime next year.andM;Apple claims that every major font vendor except Adobe will be converting itsentire library to Royal, which would be encouraging if it weren't for thefact that Adobe dominates the PostScript font market.andP;  Still, vendors areeagerly lining up behind Royal.andP;  &quot;We expect to be the first to have asignificant font library available with System 7.0,&quot; said Louise Domenitz,public relations director at Bitstream Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;Ourbusiness is fonts, and we will supply them in whatever format users need.&quot;andM;Bitstream claims that for existing owners, the upgrade to System 7.0 will bereasonably priced and that the new packages will contain both System 7.0 andPostScript Type 1 outlines.andM;Adobe also has been lining up support for its format, having licensed itsfont-creation tools to several leading type vendors, in-cluding Compugraphicof Wilmington, Mass.; Monotype of Elk Grove Village, Ill.; and Varityper ofEast Hanover, N.J., since last March.andM;However, when Adobe publishes the Type 1 specifications, anyone will be ableto take advantage of its hinting, encryption, compression and betterprinting.andP;  But Adobe warns that it won't be easy.andP;  &quot;If you were handed theparts list for a Ferrari, you would probably still find it very difficult toput together something that ran,&quot; said an Adobe white paper on third-partydevelopment of Type 1 fonts.andM;A wilderness of choices.andP;  Users seem to be faced with a complicated choice ofcomponents from among Adobe's Type 1, ATM and PostScript; Apple's System 7.0and Royal; and Microsoft's PostScript clone.andM;&quot;We're not abandoning PostScript,&quot; said Apple's Gable.andP;  &quot;We'll continue tosupport it and bring out new PostScript printers.andP;  System 7 will bebackward-compatible with hardware and software, including fonts.andP;  It will allwork, and that's why owning a Mac is a cool thing.&quot;andM;But if Apple is really concerned with compatibility, why did it need a secondfont format?andP;  Many users see the second format as a return to the bad olddays when typesetter manufacturers jealously guarded their font libraries andno two were compatible.andM;The inky crystal ball.andP;  Even though vendors are ready for two font standards,users are not.andP;  And it will be some time before there are as many Royal fontsas Type 1.andP;  This is where the significance of the Apple/Microsoft agreementcomes in.andP;  Microsoft's OS/2 is relatively new, and sales of OS/2 machineswith Royal could be a formidable market force.andP;  The high-end world thatalready has Adobe fonts may remain loyal yet soon be outnumbered by theoffice automation world that buys Royal.andM;Users can hope that increased competition will lower costs and improve thequality of fonts and printers.andP;  &quot;The bottom line is that there will be lotsof fonts,&quot; Gable said.andP;  &quot;And as far as the user goes, things will just work.&quot;andM;Despite Apple's official optimism, System 7.0's release is bound to causeconfusion and incompatibilities.andM;Apple's new deal with Microsoft drove a wedge between Apple and Adobe, butboth companies claim that the lines of communication remain open.andP;  &quot;I don'tlike to be at odds with Apple,&quot; Warnock said.andP;  &quot;It's not good for either ofus.andP;  I have a Mac II on my desk at home, and it's in my best interest forthat to be a productive machine.andP;  I have no quarrel with Apple doing what itthinks is best for its business.andP;  I'm delighted with the features in System7.&quot;andM;Adobe announced it would write a PostScript-Royal translator when Appleannounced Royal in May. But since the formation of the Apple-Microsoftalliance in September, Adobe has dropped the project, saying that Apple coulddo a better job.andM;Apple says it will pick up the ball.andP;  In addition, several third parties,including The Company, are working on similar translators, which could saveusers money in font upgrades and help avoid the necessity of buying two fontlibraries.andM;&quot;In the past, and even with Adobe, fonts were things that you got with outputdevices,&quot; said Charles Bigelow, professor of art and computer science atStanford University in Stanford, Calif., and a font designer with Bigelow andamp;Holmes of Menlo Park, Calif.andP;  &quot;Fonts are becoming allied to operatingsystems.andP;  Apple and Microsoft together cover much of the world of operatingsystems, so that their battle with Adobe affects the entire market.andP;  The fontmarket used to be tens of thousands of typographers.andP;  Now it is millions.andO;That means there will be more creativity and more variety.&quot;andM;For all the font controversy that this year has brought, next year is likelyto bring more upheaval and angst.andP;  This year has seen the start of thebattles, and next year users will decide whose system is better.andP;  They mayeven find that the double standard is a good thing.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
