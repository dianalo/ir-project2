An embassy statement said the remains will be flown fromVietnam's capital of Hanoi to the U.S. Army Central IdentificationLaboratory in Hawaii for identification and return to next-of-kin.   Remains are usually returned in a simple ceremony at Hanoi's NoiBai airport, with a U.S. officials saluting as a U.S. militaryhonor guard carries the caskets onto a U.S. military transportplane.   The turnover would be the fifth since retired Gen. John W.Vessey, acting as a special presidential envoy, reached anagreement in Hanoi last August to significantly speed up progess onthe issue.   The United States was told about the remains during regulartalks in Hanoi last month between technical experts of the twosides.   The lack of diplomatic relations between the two countries hashindered the attempt to account for the fates of nearly 1,800Americans who remain missing in action. U.S. forces withdrew fromSouth Vietnam in 1973 after the involvement cost 58,000 Americanlives.   The last return of remains, on April 6, was the largest ever.Vietnam returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified asthose of Americans, and three other sets which it said were thoseof ethnic Asians who might possibly be among the missing Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
