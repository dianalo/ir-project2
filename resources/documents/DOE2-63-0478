The crystals are monoclinic P2/sub 1/ or P2/sub 1//m withcell dimensions a = 6.71 A, b (fiber axis) = 4.68 A, c = 12.51 A, and{beta} = 123deg, and there are four monomeric units (two chains) in theunit cell. The molecular conformation is a glide (TGTG) form: the internalrotation angles of two successive backbone bonds are 175deg (T) and 49deg(G'), and the C-CH/sub 2/-C and C-CCl/sub 2/-C bond angles are 123degand 114deg, respectively. The deviation of the internal rotation anglefrom 60deg (G) to 49deg (G') and the large C-CH/sub 2/-C bond angle areascribable to the steric hindrance between the chlorine atoms of adjacentmonomeric units. From the X-ray study, the great possibility of a disorderwith respect to the packing of upward and downward chains in the crystallattice (space group P2/sub 1//m) is inferred.</TEXT></DOC>
