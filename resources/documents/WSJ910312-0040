Is the Target   Of FTC Probe   ---   Company Is Under Scrutiny   Following Rivals' Claims   It Manipulates Market   ----   By G.

Critics of Microsoft have long claimed that the softwaregiant is manipulating the industry in order to crush smallerconcerns and hurt larger rivals, such as Lotus DevelopmentCorp. The FTC is apparently putting this theory to the test,said executives with software companies who have beencontacted by the agency.</LP><TEXT>   Executives said the inquiries center on Microsoft's uniquerole as major supplier of both system software, whichcontrols the basic operations of a personal computer, andapplications software, such as word processing or spreadsheetprograms. The FTC, among other things, is trying to determinewhether Microsoft's clout in systems software -- the Redmond,Wash., company supplies both DOS and Windows, two programsthat together comprise the standard for personal computers --gives it an unfair advantage in the applications business,where Microsoft is the fastest-growing supplier.   A spokeswoman for Microsoft confirmed that it is thetarget of a &quot;nonpublic&quot; FTC investigation that began thispast June.   &quot;Microsoft has been in regular contact with the FTC and iscooperating,&quot; the spokeswoman said. She added that &quot;Microsoftbelieves what sparked the inquiry was a Nov. 13, 1989, newsrelease regarding definitions for future versions ofDOSWindows.&quot;   A senior FTC official declined to comment. Kevin Arquit,the agency's antitrust chief, cited the FTC's policy of notdiscussing pending investigations. &quot;It's difficult to talkabout an investigation we might or might not be doing,&quot; Mr.Arquit said.   For some time, numerous software companies have complainedthat Microsoft has used its knowledge about a major shift insystem software -- for instance, to the use of Windows, agraphical interface, in combination with DOS -- to boost itsefforts in applications. In fact, Microsoft is alone amongthe nation's largest software makers in offering applicationsthat make use of the Windows environment. Other majorsoftware concerns, such as Software Publishing Corp. andLotus, in the past have charged that they and others failedto ready Windows applications because Microsoft misled themabout future system software plans.   Executives with these concerns were reluctant to repeatthese charges yesterday. However, they stressed that theyharbor no illusions about vying with Microsoft for business.   &quot;They are a very tough, ruthless and determinedcompetitor,&quot; said Paul Grayson, chief executive officer ofMicrografx Inc.   &quot;Microsoft is a large part of the landscape,&quot; said JimDavis, a software executive at Apple Computer Inc., which issuing Microsoft for copying some features of Apple's softwarefor use in Windows.   &quot;People think of {Microsoft} the way they used to think of{International Business Machines Co.},&quot; Mr. Davis said. IBMwas the subject of antitrust investigations two decades ago.   Indeed, people familiar with the FTC's inquiries say thatthe agency initially included IBM in its scrutiny, but laterdropped the company from consideration. Microsoft and IBMhave been partners in the area of system software for adecade, but recently the two companies have privately foughtover future directions and the partnership is consideredshaky at best.   Reports of the FTC inquiry first surfaced early yesterdaywhen Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,Microsoft's investment banker, issued a report suggestingthat a &quot;probe&quot; of Microsoft was under way. In an interview,Mr. Sherlund downplayed the potential impact of the FTC'sscrutiny on Microsoft, whose stock has been trading at recordhighs of late.   Mr. Sherlund said he doesn't think the FTC can mount muchof a case against Microsoft because he thinks the company hasample competition in system software -- from AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph, Apple and Digital Research Inc.   However, none of these companies except Apple hold asignificant share of the huge personal computer market.Investors were spooked by Mr. Sherlund's report, hammeringMicrosoft's stock, which closed down $3.25 to $99.25.   Whether or not Microsoft plays by the rules, there's noquestion that it has been successful. The company's 1991sales rate is 10 times what it was five years ago, and from1986 to 1990 the company's fiscal year earnings increasedfrom $39.2 million to $279.2 million. For the first halfended Dec. 31, Microsoft earned $200.5 million.   One key to Microsoft's success is Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer William Gates III, who has earned both therespect and enmity in the industry because of his ability toreap the benefits of shifts in the burgeoning personalcomputer industry.   Mr. Gates wasn't available for comment and Microsoftdidn't say why it confirmed the existence of an FTCinvestigation in response to a reporter's inquiries.   However, observers suggested that Microsoft's rivals maybe arguing that the company should be subject to the sort ofrestrictions that led to the breakup of ATandamp;T into the &quot;BabyBells&quot; in the early 1980s.   &quot;Microsoft is afraid people will draw the wrong conclusionthat this is a Baby Bill issue,&quot; said Mr. Sherlund, referringto Mr. Gates's nickname.   ---   Paul M.
