Congress probably will provide all or of the $1.9 billion increase sought for fiscal 1990, or more, after fights over offsetting cuts. The GOP resists defense cuts. Democrats may add spending increases of $2 billion annually in 1991. GOP Sen. Rudman says he &quot;can't conceive of circumstances&quot; where new revenues won't have to be considered if anti-drug spending continues to grow.    Democrats push to put their imprint on Bush's plan. Likely goals: more aid to local law enforcement and treatment and education programs. GOP pollster Linda DiVall says Democrats hurt themselves both by &quot;being negative and coming out for more spending.&quot; Bush stands to benefit, but also risks blame if his strategy fails to produce visible gains.    Success with the anti-drug plan would boost drug czar Bennett as a presidential or vice presidential candidate.    MILITARY MOVES to fight drugs in Latin America raise warnings of risks.    Army Special Forces leaders are itching to send troops to accompany drug-aid equipment to Colombia, if Colombia requests military help. They say units now in Panama could be mobilized quickly and be used initially as advisers. But other Pentagon officials, hearing echoes of Vietnam, warn that a drug war in Colombia is unwinnable.    One top administration official worries that a heavy U.S. hand in Latin America will allow Panama's Noriega to exploit charges of Yankee imperialism. U.S. economic aid might not offset the reliance on cocaine in Bolivia and Peru. U.S. planes involved in anti-drug efforts have been shot at in Peru, where the cocaine trade brings in over $1 billion a year, equal to a third of the nation's legal exports.    COPS COMPLAIN that anti-drug money for enforcement won't be enough.    Despite Bush's emphasis on law enforcement, &quot;you will not see many additional police officers on the street because of this plan,&quot; says Hubert Wilson, president of the Police Foundation. The strategy focuses more on prisons and prosecutors than on police. Houston Police Chief Lee Brown says more money is needed, &quot;particularly for state and local&quot; authorities, who experts say make more than 90% of all drug arrests.    Bureaucratic snags are a worry. &quot;Areas with serious drug problems should be identified&quot; and given money directly, argues Charles Pugh, captain of police in crack-plagued Seaford, Del. Says Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson, &quot;I don't have any idea how much money we'll get or how soon we'll get it.&quot; Columbus, Ohio, chief Dwight Joseph doesn't expect any aid to &quot;trickle down&quot; until at least next summer.    The police officials, however, generally praise Bush for taking a leadership role in combating illegal drugs.    EARS ONLY: Sununu left a social event Wednesday night to go huddle privately with a cabinet member at a dinner party about the extradition of a reputed Colombian drug leader. The White House chief of staff apparently was concerned about the security of the phones in the private homes.    VOTER TURNOUT and racial issues will be keys to Tuesday's New York Democratic mayoral primary. Koch decides to rely more heavily on TV ads to try to attract undecided white voters. Dinkins's calls for racial reconciliation after the Brooklyn murder of a black youth intensifies his support among blacks and liberal whites.    DEMOCRATS HANG ON to the lead in Tuesday's Texas special election for Wright's old House seat, but Democratic candidate Geren hasn't pulled away. Wright's campaigning helps Geren, but Republican Lanier plans a late offensive of negative ads accusing his rival of changing positions on defense issues.    PROCUREMENT TIGHTENING at the Pentagon gets a boost as new civilian acquisition chief John Betti quietly gains increased authority from Cheney to override purchasing decisions made by the services. But the real test of Cheney's &quot;reform&quot; drive won't come until next month, when he receives proposals to shrink the enormous web of contracting offices.    PAC ATTACKS fade as lawmakers get cold feet on setting constraints.    House Democrats become a major obstacle. Speaker Foley wavers, hoping for a bipartisan consensus from a task force. Some House Democrats fear defeat without political-action committees, which supply half their re-election funds. Rep. Swift complains of &quot;paranoia.&quot; He says both parties think they will be hurt by any change.    Bush fails to find a House sponsor for his six-week-old plan to banish business and union PACs. Some House Republicans press their own plan to slash the maximum PAC gift 80%, to $1,000 per election. But some GOP members defend PACs. Rep. Edwards says they are being made scapegoats for his party's own weak candidates.    Latest figures show PACs gave $14.5 million to House incumbents during the first half of this year, up 15% from the 1987 first half.    MINOR MEMOS: Asked about his successful effort to quit smoking, Bennett says, &quot;I'm not sure I'm a better man,&quot; but &quot;I'm a somewhat bigger man.&quot; . . . An omen? The Texas congressional delegation plans a salute to former Speaker Wright this month. The date is the 13th. . . . An appeals court rules that Ohio Rep. Traficant must pay taxes on bribes he was acquitted of receiving. </TEXT></DOC>
