A former customer of Mr. Shapiro's, 24-year-old Daniel Silverman, was sentenced to three years' probation and 200 hours of public service. The two also received $25,000 fines from U.S. District Judge Gerard L. Goettel, and their attorneys said they expect significant civil penalties to be sought soon against both men by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Mr. Shapiro is the first person in the case to receive a prison sentence. Two former analysts at Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. received probationary sentences.    The fifth and central figure in the case, 28-year-old Michael David, is to be sentenced early next month. Mr. David admitted in November to orchestrating the insider-trading scheme using confidential information about pending business transactions stolen from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, a New York law firm where he was an associate.    The government said Messrs. David, Shapiro and Silverman made about $160,000 trading on the inside information using an account at Moseley in Mr. Silverman's name.    Messrs. Shapiro and Silverman, both currently living in Rhode Island, pleaded guilty last June before Judge Goettel in Manhattan federal court. The judge, who recently was reassigned here, emphasized that the two men profited from the scheme whereas the two analysts he earlier sentenced to probation hadn't.    But the judge said Mr. Silverman was &quot;somewhat less culpable than Shapiro&quot; because unlike the other four figures in the case, he didn't work on Wall Street.    Mr. Shapiro sold mutual funds at Moseley, which at the time he worked there was called Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook andamp; Weeden Inc. His attorney, Thomas H. Sear, blamed Mr. David for his client's participation in the scheme and perjury before the SEC. The attorney said he expects Mr. Shapiro to disgorge $34,000 in illicit profits and pay an undetermined penalty to the SEC, which so far hasn't charged him.    Mr. Shapiro, before sentencing, told the judge he was sorry for &quot;everything that has happened&quot; and sat down quickly.    Mr. Silverman blamed his participation in the scheme on the fact that he &quot;had a very casual attitude at the time,&quot; and said he wishes &quot;I hadn't done it.&quot;    His attorney, Lee Richards, said he expects the SEC to demand at least $50,000, if not more, in civil penalties from his client. Though Mr. Silverman wasn't a member of the securities industry, he is liable to such a penalty under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. </TEXT></DOC>
