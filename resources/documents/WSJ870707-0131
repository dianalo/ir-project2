CohenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   When some executives get fired or resign from their companies, they use their time to improve their golf scores. Others come back to haunt former employers by helping devise schemes to take control.    But ex-executives may find that plotting takeovers of their corporate alma maters can be dangerous. Chances are they will be hit with lawsuits alleging that they illegally passed on to outsiders confidential financial information about their former employers.    Last month, in an unprecedented ruling, a federal judge in Greensboro, N.C., halted a hostile takeover bid for Burlington Industries Inc. by Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. and New York investor Asher B. Edelman.    The judge said that James J. Ammeen, a former Burlington executive vice president, probably had illegally passed confidential financial data to the bidders, even though Dominion, Mr. Edelman and Mr. Ammeen denied that they had done anything wrong.    The North Carolina ruling &quot;suggests that former executives who make (hostile) bids for their companies will face attack again and again,&quot; says Stephen Fraidin, a New York takeover lawyer. Adds Carl Reisner, an attorney for Dominion and Mr. Edelman: &quot;No deal before Burlington was ever stopped because of this issue.&quot;    Because of the risk of being sued, some investment bankers say they won't even talk about takeovers with former employees, for fear of learning things they aren't supposed to know.    &quot;We have guys who were fired or left a company come in all the time&quot; asking for help in making bids for their former employers, says Donald Brennan, head of merchant banking at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;We show them the door. It's too dangerous to talk to them.&quot;    &quot;Sometimes when you make a bid for a company, former executives surface from the underbrush offering you information,&quot; adds Robert S. Pirie, president and chief executive officer of Rothschild Inc. &quot;I tell them to get lost, because inevitably someone will allege that I have confidential information and the burden will be on me to show I don't.&quot;    Still, some executives who were targets of lawsuits say they were prepared for litigation. &quot;I knew going in that they would dump all over me, say I gave away confidential information and make me feel like Attila the Hun,&quot; says John E. Peters, a former director and chief operating officer of JWT Group Inc. who last month helped WPP Group PLC launch a successful bid for the giant advertising, public-relations and market-research company.    Mr. Peters, 55 years old, was fired last January in a management dispute after 30 years with JWT. He planned to start a company to import handmade goods from Europe. He also looked forward to expanding the tiny charter-aircraft concern that had been his hobby for years. Then, last February, he was contacted by Martin Sorrell, chairman of WPP, the British marketing-services concern.    Mr. Peters says he didn't convey any confidential data to Mr. Sorrell, who indicated that he would give Mr. Peters a senior job if WPP took over JWT.    &quot;I'm a poor loser, but I don't look at myself as a vindictive person,&quot; Mr. Peters says. &quot;I felt that there were still a lot of great things to be done at JWT, and Mr. Sorrell could do them.&quot;    Nevertheless, when WPP went after JWT, the latter sued Mr. Peters on grounds of misappropriating confidential data. And as part of its pact last month to be bought by WPP, JWT dropped its suit against Mr. Peters but insisted he be barred from working at JWT. He will work for WPP.    Other executives say hostile bids for old employers probably aren't worth the trouble. &quot;My wife can't speak without crying, my neighbors give me strange looks, and two of the business deals I was working on are on hold because people are nervous about me,&quot; says Mr. Ammeen, who resigned as executive vice president of Burlington in November 1985.    A group led by Morgan Stanley acquired control of Burlington last month in a leveraged buyout. The North Carolina court suit against Mr. Ammeen, Mr. Edelman and Dominion is still pending.    Not all executives who help fashion bids for their former companies get hit with lawsuits. Joel Smilow and Donald Kelly left Esmark Inc. after it was acquired by Beatrice Cos. in 1984. Both later joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s successful bid for Beatrice. Mr. Kelly is now Beatrice's chairman. Mr. Smilow is chairman of the company's former Playtex Inc. unit, which he bought last year.    &quot;I had been out of the company for a year and a half, and I wasn't worried about being sued,&quot; Mr. Smilow says. &quot;I was just trying to come back to the company I'd been with for 15 years.&quot;    But unlike Beatrice, plenty of other takeover targets have tried to stop hostile bidders by alleging that they used confidential information obtained from insiders or former employees.    Last year, Kaiser Aluminum andamp; Chemical Corp. sued former Vice Presidents Ira R. Davidson and Arthur H. Woodward. The former Kaiser executives were assisting a group of investors led by J.A. Frates, the Oklahoma businessman who waged a proxy fight for the company.    Kaiser agreed to drop the suits after Alan Clore, an associate of Mr. Frates, took control of the company last year. But like JWT, Kaiser insisted that Messrs. Davidson and Woodward have nothing to do with the company. An associate of the two former executives adds that an agreement they signed prohibited them from talking about the bid for Kaiser.    Yet despite the tangle of lawsuits, many investment bankers say they would still be willing to work on hostile bids involving former employees.    &quot;We don't have a set policy,&quot; says Joseph Perella, co-head of investment banking at First Boston Corp. &quot;We take a look at the person -- is it Mr. Respectable or Ms. Wunderkind, or someone who's out for a vengeance? The fact that the person used to work for a company shouldn't mean he's paralyzed from doing anything.&quot;    Mr. Perella says First Boston has seen more former employees trying to stir up takeovers of former employers in recent years, largely because corporate restructurings have left many top executives without jobs. &quot;We're not encouraging or discouraging them,&quot; he says. &quot;We're just making sure we comply with the law.&quot;    Besides, Mr. Perella adds, much of the time there's little to worry about because &quot;half the people who come to see us have flaky ideas anyway.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
