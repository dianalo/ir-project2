(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Slain Black Panther Party co-founder HueyP. Newton, whose cry of ``Power to the people!'' electrified thecivil rights movement, struggled with the legend that surroundedhim, according to family and friends.   As police continued searching for clues to his pre-dawn slaying aday earlier, loved ones and associates Wednesday offered theirinsights into the man whose radical views, including the use ofviolence, heightened black militancy.   The Black Panthers were the ultimate symbol of that socialmovement. But in the view of many in law enforcement, the Pantherswere as described in the 1960s by the FBI: ``hoodlum-typerevolutionaries,'' stockpiling weapons, espousing Marxist-Leninistdoctrines and terrorizing black communities.   Black leaders and other admirers of Newton's chafed at portrayalsof him as a gangster and said such statements could stir racialtensions and lead to a violent backlash.   ``A lot of black people are very angered by the fact that HueyNewton is getting put in the box of being a gangster,'' said theRev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church inSan Francisco. ``That only incites people and could lead to acts ofviolence.''   No suspects have been identified in Newton's killing and nomotive offered by police, although authorities speculated theslaying could have been drug- or gang-related, or an act of randomviolence or an aborted robbery.   ``We're making some progress but nothing significant,'' saidOakland police Lt. Mike Sims.   About 50 mourners, some of whom said Newton's philosophy helpedblacks battle racism, gathered Wednesday for a second night in thedrug-infested neighborhood of rundown Victorian-style houses whereNewton, 47, was gunned down.   Those who knew him well met with reporters at his brother's home.   ``He was certainly a lonely man in that we didn't have any morefights, any more struggles,'' said former Panther leader DavidHilliard. ``We talked a lot about loneliness and our desire torecreate the energy of the 60s.   ``He regretted that he was not more successful at eradicatingsexism, racism and classism.''   Newton's latest plans were to make a film about environmentalproblems, which he believed were linked to the oppression ofminorities, said his brother, Melvin.   Newton's wife of almost five years, Fredrika, 37, said herhusband had been feeling well and spending a lot of time at her homein Berkeley while recuperating from two recent abdominal operations.   She denied reports that Newton had a drug problem or agirlfriend, saying he was a devoted husband and father to her sonfrom a previous marriage.   Newton was incarcerated for 90 days earlier this year forpossession of drug paraphernalia.   But Newton's older brother would not comment on reports ofNewton's drug problems, instead portraying the slain leader as a manwho devoted himself years ago to the struggle for social justice.   ``He had no particular concerns about his own life,'' said MelvinNewton. ``He felt that once he decided to be a revolutionary, he wasin a position of suicide anyway.''</TEXT></DOC>
