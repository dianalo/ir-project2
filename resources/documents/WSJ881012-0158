Instead of spending government money, federal regulators would rely on a private accrediting agency controlled by the medical community to inspect and certify hospitals that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients.    Federal officials, however, have failed to carry out a congressional mandate to make sure this delegation of authority hasn't victimized hospital patients and taxpayers. U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) records show that serious deficiencies have been found in hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. These records, and interviews with government officials, also reveal that:   --For years, the HHS's assurances to the public and Congress that the joint commission was doing a good job were based on inadequate samplings of hospitals.    --The HHS has been as much as three years behind in filing annual public reports evaluating the joint commission.    --Top federal regulators were unaware of lengthy administrative delays, some lasting almost two years, that kept the joint commission from acting promptly against seriously substandard hospitals.    Amid criticism that the government was shirking its responsibility, Congress in 1972 ordered federal health officials to monitor joint commission work and report annually on what they found.    But Thomas Morford, director of health standards and quality for the HHS's Health Care Financing Administration, concedes his agency didn't inspect enough accredited hospitals. Monitoring the joint commission &quot;is only now catching up&quot; to other, more pressing pursuits, such as cracking down on bad nursing homes, Mr. Morford says.    A spot survey last year has encouraged the HCFA to pay closer attention to the joint commission. The survey, as yet unreleased, found about one-third of 58 accredited hospitals substandard in a major area of operation. &quot;Certainly no hospital should be out of compliance at that level,&quot; says Mr. Morford. &quot;It merits some serious investigation.&quot;    Mr. Morford says his concern is tempered because the Health Care Financing Administration, or HCFA, also uses physician peer-review organizations, independent of the joint commission, to monitor the quality of hospital care.    Critics take no comfort in peer-review groups. &quot;Most are doing nothing, or almost nothing,&quot; says Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group, a consumer group. &quot;Why HCFA has not done the job is the same reason why the political power of American hospitals has prevailed so often,&quot; Dr. Wolfe says. &quot;These are extraordinarily powerful institutions.&quot;    The federal government's reliance on joint commission accreditation dates back to the enactment of Medicare in 1965. But the commission never sought a regulatory role, says Paul Mullen, its director of government affairs. He says it makes no pretense of being a regulatory agency and is mostly educational.    Critics say the federal approach was wrong from the start. &quot;The hospital industry is government-funded. It should be government-regulated,&quot; says Dr. Wolfe.    Congress has yet to receive the 1986 and 1987 HCFA reports on the joint commission. &quot;It is certainly nothing purposeful,&quot; an HCFA spokesman says. &quot;It's just that we are chronically late.&quot;    Although the law requires the HCFA to make a yearly list of hospitals with serious deficiencies identified by health inspections, the agency itself finds it difficult to retrieve the information. At HCFA headquarters in Baltimore, officials don't compile the information &quot;in any form they have any confidence in,&quot; says Dennis Seibert, a spokesman.    This year, in a Freedom of Information Act request, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked for a list of hospitals found deficient since January 1986. The HCFA eventually did produce a list of 156 accredited hospitals, many clustered in California, Texas, Florida and New York, that were out of compliance with federal standards.    Uneven efforts by state health departments and HCFA regional offices may partly explain the clustering. Because many state inspections are triggered by complaints, patients' awareness of complaint procedures also seems a factor.    A patient's &quot;bill of rights&quot; encourages complaints in New York, which conducts about twice as many investigations as the federal government commissions in all 50 states combined. </TEXT></DOC>
