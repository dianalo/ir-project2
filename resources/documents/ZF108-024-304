(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Connie GuglielmoandM;Cupertino, Calif.andP;  -- December was anything but a holiday for Apple as thecompany dealt with declining sales of its lower-end machines, a lawsuitchallenging its copyright to the Mac interface, and investment analysts'predictions that the company is slipping behind in the personal computermarket.andM;The bad news started rolling in when Daniel Benton of Goldman, Sachs in NewYork reduced his earnings estimate by 17 percent, from $4.50 per share to$3.75, and downgraded the stock from a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation to &quot;hold.&quot;andM;Apple followed up with an announcement Dec.andP;  12 that earnings for the firstquarter of fiscal 1990, which ended Dec.andP;  29, 1989, would be belowexpectations.andM;Two days later, Xerox Corp. filed suit against the company, charging that theApple's Lisa and Mac interfaces unlawfully incorporated &quot;material&quot; developedby Xerox (see story, this page).andM;Apple cited several factors for the lower-than-anticipated sales results forthe quarter, including declining unit sales of its low-end machines, the MacPlus, Mac SE and Apple II, and an inability to ramp up production of theMacintosh Portable because of an inadequate supply of the machine's uniquescreen display.andM;&quot;Generally in the holiday season we see a surge in sales, ...andP;  but this yearwe're not seeing the seasonal growth that we had expected at the low end,&quot;Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur said last week.andM;Apple also said that earnings per share for the quarter will be below the$1.10 level posted a year ago.andP;  The market responded quickly to the Applestatement and Goldman, Sachs projections, with Apple stock dropping by $5.50to $33.75 during the week ended Dec.andP;  15.andP;  The stock, which traded as high as$45.25 in early December, has rebounded slightly, closing at $37.50 on Jan.andO;3.andM;Apple also announced last week that it will be repurchasing up to 2.5 millionshares of its common stock.andM;In a report to investors last month, Benton, who could not be reached forcomment, identified two factors adversely affecting Apple's momentum in thebusiness market:andM;andgt;Sales of low-end, older machines were below expectations, with unit sales ofthe Mac Plus for the fiscal first quarter estimated at 60,000, compared with85,000 units for the same period last year.andP;  He also forecast a slide in unitsales of the Mac SE for the quarter to 80,000, down from 145,000 in the firstfiscal quarter of 1989.andM;Storeboard Inc., a Dallas-based market research firm, also reported thatwhile Mac revenues were up 9.5 percent for the first 10 months of 1989,dealers reported a 12.2 percent decline in unit sales of the Mac comparedwith 1988, from 270,400 units for the same period in 1988 to 237,500 in 1989.andM;Benton wrote that while Apple plans to replace the Plus and SE -- the onlyMacs in its product lineup that retail for less than $3,000 -- with new,modular units in fiscal 1991, the company's hardware line will remainunchanged during the next 12 months.andM;andgt;A more fundamental problem, according to Benton, is that the Macintosh maybe losing its technological edge as other computer manufacturers,particularly Microsoft Corp. and IBM, develop graphical user interfaces thatrival the Mac's ease of use.andP;  &quot;While we anticipated that applications [forthese interfaces] would arrive someday, we believed that Apple'sstill-superior ease of use and functionality would win out.andP;  Unfortunately,it appears that this is not the case and we now believe that Apple is losingmomentum in the business market.&quot;andM;Benton predicted that only 90,000 Portables would ship in fiscal 1990 asopposed to an earlier estimate of 120,000.andP;  The drop caused Benton to predictan overall decline of unit shipments of all Mac and Apple systems for fiscal1990 to 1.49 million, down from nearly 1.5 million in 1989.andM;Apple is expected to release its first quarter results, as well as theresults of its holiday &quot;Cash Back or Free Trial Run&quot; promotion, later thismonth, LeVasseur said.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
