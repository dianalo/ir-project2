Peter Tomsen told a news conference the fractious guerrilla``interim government'' remained the strongest symbol of the11-year-old insurgency movement. He conceded, however, that theinternecine fighting within the guerrilla alliance is``discouraging.''   The two most powerful rebel groups _ Jamiat-i-Islami andHezb-i-Islami _ are fighting with each other in northern Afghanistan.   On Wednesday, Hezb-i-Islami's charismatic leader, GulbaddinHekmatyar, suspended his role in the rebel government to protest itsfailure to hold elections. He is foreign minister of that government.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, an Islamic scholar and president of theguerrilla interim government, labeled Hekmatyar a ``killer.'' Hesaid publicly that the vociferously anti-American Hekmatyar has usedU.S.-supplied weapons to kill other guerrillas and other Afghans, acharge Hekmatyar denied.   On July 9, Hekmatyar's group was charged with killing 32Jamiat-i-Islami rebels.   Washington backs the anti-communist rebels trying to oust Kabul'sruling Marxist government led by President Najib.   Tomsen said Moscow has swamped its Afghan communist allies withmilitary hardware, including medium-range Scud missiles, sincepulling the Red Army out of the Central Asian nation Feb. 15.   After nine years of military intervention the Kremlin withdrewmore than 110,000 soldiers from Afghanistan in line with aU.N.-brokered accord.   Tomsen said since the Soviet troop withdrawal, more than 2,000Soviet flights loaded with supplies have landed at Kabul airport. Hesaid 300 Soviet military advisers remain in the Afghan capital.   Tomsen said the advisers have orchestrated hundreds of Scudmissile firings and that some missiles hit Pakistan. Scud has arange of up to 170 miles.   Soviet personnel are also working in key Afghan governmentministries, said Tomsen.   He blamed the continued fighting in Afghanistan on the SovietUnion.   Washington will support a political settlement that removes Najiband his Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan from power.   Millions of dollars in U.S. military and humanitarian help havegone to the Afghan guerrillas through Pakistan, which also harborsmore than 3 million war refugees.   Gradually, however, the guerrilla government has been givendirect U.S. aid until now Tomsen said almost 50 percent of allhumanitarian and military help goes directly to it.</TEXT></DOC>
