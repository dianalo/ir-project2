Presiding Judge Warren Conklin willrule Monday on whether to extend the temporary restraining order now in placeagainst the Harbor District until the suit can be decided.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COMMERCE, PUBLIC SAFETY BOIL OVER IN A BITTERSTEW IN AVILA BEACH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The pier is one of three in the cove that embraces Avila Beach and Port SanLuis. One is a relatively new public pier, on the site of the People's Piererected shortly after the Civil War by Honest John Harford. Another isprivate; Union Oil uses it to load tankers from the tank farm on the hillabove the town of Avila.;    The third, at Port San Luis opposite the road toDiablo Canyon nuclear power plant, has been built, burned and rebuilt in aregular cycle since about 1870. The current pier was built in 1919.;    Thewarehouse at its end lost its sides 30 or 40 years ago -- County HistoryMuseum Director Mark Hall-Patton isn't sure exactly when -- to become thewooden canopy tourists know today.;    Long before the highways came, &quot;Thatwas the way into the county,&quot; Hall-Patton said. &quot;That was the terminus for therailway -- most shipping tied up there -- that was the main point ofembarkation and debarkation.&quot;;    The harbor is home both to small craft andto a commercial fishing fleet, which uses the pier. Olde Port Fish buys fishand runs a wholesale/retail sales operation. It also runs a popularrestaurant, the Olde Port Inn, beneath the canopy.;    Father-son operation;Barry Cohen owns Olde Port Fish. His son Leonard runs the restaurant. It wasLeonard who created its statewide reputation with events such as afish-and-wine tasting every January that limo'd chefs, reporters andwinemakers to the end of the pier for a black-tie charity event. At least oneof these events was threatened at the last minute by fire-safety complaints,for which Leonard Cohen blamed the Harbor District.;    Three and a half yearsago, according to Harbor District Chairman Britt Phillips, plans were floatedto repair the canopy. &quot;The more studies and the more investigation we've had .. . the more we found that it was impossible just to repair,&quot; said Phillips.Plans were drawn to rebuild the pier supports and replace the canopy with asimilar structure.;     Cohens 'never showed';    The Army Corps of Engineersin Los Angeles approved the project. Phillips complains that the Cohens tookno interest in the hearing process until early this year, shortly before workwas scheduled to begin.;    &quot;They were invited and we sent them registeredletters and it was posted in our agendas to come to get in on the process,&quot; hesaid, &quot;and they never showed.&quot;;    The Harbor District's structural studyconcluded the canopy was unsafe. An engineer hired by the Cohens, examiningthe same data, arrived at the opposite conclusion.;    The Corps of Engineers,asked to look at the project again, sent its own engineer and at the end ofMarch again wrote the Harbor District giving permission to replace the canopyif it wished to.;    Lease violations alleged;    On April 2, the Cohens sued,claiming a series of lease violations by the Harbor District dating back to1987, including the &quot;unpermitted and unilateral removal&quot; of a hoist and theCohens' ice machine.;    A particularly sore point is the gate at the land endof the pier, which the district has ordered closed since last September. Thatmeans patrons must walk the quarter-mile to the restaurant.;    &quot;With some ofthe structural changes that the Harbor (District) is proposing, we'll have todefinitely revamp our operation,&quot; said Leonard Cohen.;    &quot;They're puttingcrossbeams in through our lounge in places where there's tables.&quot; Windowswould be blocked. &quot;It will definitely affect the atmosphere of ourrestaurant,&quot; he said wryly.;     Not quite a 'feud';  Phillips balks at usingthe word &quot;feud&quot; to describe relations with the Cohens. But he said theyhabitually ignore established procedures. &quot;What they've done in the past,&quot;said Phillips, &quot;they've sold all their tickets, made all their advertising,and then come to us and asked if they could have&quot; an event.;    &quot;They treat uslike mushrooms.&quot;;    Hall-Patton, the museum director, said he'd &quot;preferseeing the canopy retained if possible. . . . It's been modified, but still,that massing has always existed at the end of the wharf.&quot; A new version wouldbe acceptable but not desirable, and moreover would have to be delayed whilework beneath the pier is done.;     Engineers' view;  &quot;Most engineers tend tobe very conservative about historical structures,&quot; he said. &quot; 'Let's take itdown and ask questions later.' . . . It does at times lead to a skewed,less-than-completely-positive view of the structure and of its chances.&quot;;   He said the wrangle between the Cohens and the Harbor District is a sideissue. &quot;What the Harbor Commission wants to do with its lessees, that's up tothe Harbor Commission,&quot; he said. This &quot;has nothing to do with whether there'sa restaurant at the end of the wharf. I couldn't care less. Whether thatrestaurant is there or not, that's an historic structure. That's what it comesdown to.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID L.
