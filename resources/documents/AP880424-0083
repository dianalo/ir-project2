Israeli solders have killed 173 Palestinian protesters in thenearly five-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza, according to U.N. figures. AnIsraeli soldier and civilian also have been killed.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet that 165Palestinians have died in the uprising, including 147 killed bysoldiers, Israel radio said Sunday. Rabin said 4,900 Palestinianshave been detained since Dec. 8, including 1,700 held inadministrative detention for up to six months without trial.   Police ordered Arab merchants in Jerusalem to open their storesat normal hours in a tug-of-war with protest leaders, who are alsotrying to dictate when shops may do business.   ``I am afraid for my life,'' 43-year-old Saleh Sagari said,explaining why he opened his tiny grocery shop at hours dictated bythe uprising's leaders. ``If I open (during army-ordered hours),they will burn me down.''   Police in riot gear delivered the new orders to shopkeepersalong the Street of the Prophets just outside the walled Old City.Officers on horses kept back curious tourists and passers-by.   Shopkeepers could be jailed for two years if they defy thearmy's instructions, said police spokesman Rafi Levy.   In the West Bank village of Bet Roch near Hebron, Arab witnessessaid Ahmad Hassan Salim Amar, 23, was killed Saturday when hedefied the army order to halt. The army said it was investigating.   The army had reported Saturday that another Palestinian waskilled during a protest in the West Bank village of Qabatiya.   Meanwhile, the socialist Labor Party of Foreign Minister ShimonPeres adopted on Sunday its platform for the November elections andsaid it would submit any agreement for a Middle East peace toIsraeli voters, according to party spokeswoman Michal Cohen.   The platform also called for Jewish settlements to remain in theoccupied lands. But it said parts of the occupied territories witha high percentage of Arab residents may be returned toJordanian-Palestinian control.   In addition to lifting the four-day ban Sunday, Israel alsopermitted deliveries of gasoline to the occupied areas for thefirst time in more than a month.   It ended a six-day curfew in more than a dozen towns and refugeecamps, also helping thousands of Arab workers reach jobs in Israel,an army spokesman said. But curfews were extended a seventh day onthree towns on the West Bank and a refugee camp in Gaza.   The spokesman said the curfew in the Boureij refugee camp wasintended to allow soldiers to destroy buildings which were put upwithout permits. Arab reports said the army destroyed eight housesand four shops and took down stone barricades protesters haderected on roads.   The army spokesman would not say what buildings were torn down.An Associated Press photographer saw a garage, part of a gasstation on the outskirts of Buoreij, reduced to rubble. The ownersaid he didn't know why his property was razed.   The army has destroyed Arab shops and homes during the uprisingin an effort to make life difficult for organizers of the protestson land that Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War.   In Arab east Jerusalem, about 30 police, some in riot helmetsand carrying clubs and automatic rifles, issued orders toshopkeepers opposite Damascus Gate to stop following instructionsof uprising leaders to open their shops only in the late afternoon.   Police had ordered about 25 merchants on the street to open allday Sunday, but merchants defied the order and threw open theirdoors only at the hours set by the underground leaders.   Police spokesman Levy said police orders issued Sunday said thatstores must be closed from late afternoon through early eveningbeginning Monday.   Several shopkeepers said they were confused by the conflictingorders and uncertain about what to do.   ``We don't want to open. We don't know what we want to do,''said Mohammed Aldi, 25, who runs a coffee shop.   Aldi said he did not know who was issuing the uprising orders.``They call you on the telephone and tell you what to do. You don'tknow who called,'' he said.   Also Sunday, a military court gave an Israeli soldier, SaguyHarpaz, a suspended prison term of five months for taking part inbeating two Arab protesters. Saguy was also reduced in rank fromprivate first class to private.   The Feb. 25 incident was filmed by CBS television and showedfour soldiers, including Harpaz, beat the Arabs with rocks andrifle butts for more than half an hour.</TEXT></DOC>
