Big Blue's earnings, at $1.30 a share, were well received on Wall Street, which had widely expected the company to report profit as low as $1 a share. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, IBM shares closed at $147.625, up $2.625.    The first-quarter results were boosted by such non-business-related factors as the weak dollar and a lower tax rate. However, stronger-than-expected equipment sales could be an early sign of a long-awaited turnaround by IBM. Although the company is expected to have lower earnings in the current quarter, IBM's second-half results should be significantly better -- largely because of new products, reduced expenses and comparisons with weak year-earlier totals.    &quot;This was quite surprising,&quot; said Ulric Weil, an analyst affiliated with Gartner Securities Corp. &quot;It means the entire computer industry looks a lot more attractive than it did before today.&quot;    Meanwhile, first-quarter earnings were apparently salvaged by strong March sales of IBM's mainframe computers and record sales of personal computers throughout the period. &quot;What happened was they acquired a quarter's worth of business in March,&quot; said John B. Jones, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.    IBM said first-quarter earnings declined to $785 million from $1.02 billion, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 5.5%, to $10.68 billion from $10.13 billion.    Still, IBM's profit was weaker than it appeared on the surface. The latest results are compared with a tepid 1986 first quarter, when profit rose only 3.1%. The company's earnings also received a boost from favorable currency translations, which increased profit by about $95 million, or roughly 16 cents a share. Revenue, excluding the foreign-currency translations, declined 1.2%.    In addition, earnings would have been lower if IBM hadn't used a lower tax rate of 41%, compared with almost 45% a year earlier. Also, per-share profit was boosted by two cents because IBM had fewer shares outstanding than in the 1986 first quarter.    Nevertheless, IBM's brisk computer sales in the quarter far exceeded analysts' expectations. Hardware sales increased 6.5%, to $6.5 billion, an increase twice as big as some industry analysts had estimated.    The increase was primarily fueled by IBM's large mainframe computers, analysts said. Sales sputtered earlier in the quarter, largely because customers were scrutinizing IBM's January introduction of two new models and price cuts in its so-called Sierra mainframe line. &quot;(We) began to gain momentum and had an excellent March,&quot; an IBM spokesman said.    On a world-wide basis, Mr. Weil of Gartner Securities estimated that IBM sold almost 500 mainframes. &quot;March came in like a lion,&quot; he added. &quot;When you get that surge in the particularly profitable highend shipments, that pumps a lot of money into the bottom line.&quot;    IBM also set a first-quarter record for unit sales of personal computers, the company said. The spokesman declined to elaborate. But &quot;it looked like they were 70% to 80% ahead of any first quarter in the history of the product,&quot; said Mr. Jones of Montgomery Securities.    The spokesman declined to discuss the company's U.S. and international operations in detail, but said shipments &quot;were up&quot; domestically and overseas. IBM's international sales growth rate has slowed in the past year. However, &quot;the deterioration has been stemmed,&quot; said Steven Milunovich, a First Boston Corp. analyst.    IBM was clearly pleased with the quarter and its future. For the first time in more than a year, IBM Chairman John F. Akers said &quot;there are some encouraging signs in our business.&quot; Recent quarterly announcements frequently contained dire warnings from Mr. Akers regarding the state of the computer industry and IBM's prospects.    Most analysts expect IBM to report lower earnings in the current quarter -- about $1.80 a share compared with $2.12 a year earlier, Mr. Milunovich said.    But the second half is when IBM is expected to prosper. &quot;That's when they'll be hitting on all eight cylinders,&quot; Montgomery's Mr. Jones said. In July, the company is expected to start delivering its new midrange computers; IBM's sales of its new personal computer line, unveiled earlier this month, also will be well under way and the company's expenses should be lower.    In addition, IBM's expenses are expected to decline as it continues to reduce its 237,000-person U.S. work force. IBM said it expects more than 12,000 employees to take early retirement, up from a previously announced estimate of about 10,000 workers.    Despite its improving fortunes, &quot;IBM isn't totally out of the woods yet,&quot; said Mr. Milunovich of First Boston. &quot;Profit margins are still under pressure and prices are still under pressure in the computer industry and aren't likely to let up.&quot; IBM's profit margins declined almost three percentage points in the quarter, reflecting price cutting in the personal computer line &quot;and some other products,&quot; the IBM spokesman said.    Moreover, the company is expected to take more charges against earnings -- the sum may be many millions of dollars -- reflecting the redeployment of thousands of workers. An IBM sales executive has said that more than 3,000 people will be switched into the sales force this year; a total of 12,000 people were redeployed in 1986, mostly into sales. </TEXT></DOC>
