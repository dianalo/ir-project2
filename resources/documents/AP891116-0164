Keating Jr. as manager of a luxury resortowned by his failed thrift institution, Lincoln Savings and LoanAssocation.   Keating and 23 family members and associates were dismissed frompositions at The Phoenician Resort, a 605-room golf, tennis and spacomplex carved from the Arizona desert near Scottsdale, as well asfrom posts at the 344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.   Those dismissed included Keating's wife, Mary Elaine Keating,two daughters and two sons-in-law.   Regulators, accompanied by FBI agents, Phoenix police officersand private security guards, seized the properties at 1:30 a.m.local time, according to Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for theResolution Trust Corp., a new agency created this summer to handlefailed Sandamp;Ls.   A spokesman for Keating denounced the seizure as ``the mostdespicable, outrageous, blatant act of terror we have ever seen byour U.S. government.''   ``The Gestapo-like tactics used on employees and management ofthe resort are just unconscionable,'' said Bradley Boland, seniorvice president of Lincoln's parent company, American ContinentalCorp.   ``They walked in ... they locked offices, they locked desks.Then they went out into the community to the homes of the coremanagement group and posted severance notices on their front doors.These guys are gutless, ruthless, faceless bureaucrats trying tocarry out their on-going vendetta against Charlie Keating,'' Bolandsaid.   Keating's continuation as manager of the Phoenician, hadparticularly galled members of the House Banking Committee. Thepanel is investigating the collapse of the Irvine, Calif.-basedLincoln, which is expected to be the nation's largest savings andloan failure at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion.   A recent newspaper advertisement for the resort brags of its``tiered oasis of pools and waterfalls'' and ``seven finerestaurants.'' Robin Leach featured it on his television special,``The Rich and Famous, 1989 World's Best.'' Current room ratesrange from $200 a night to $3,750 for the most expensive suite,according to the House panel.   Federal regulators seized Lincoln and its subsidiaries,including The Phoenician, in April and later filed a $1.1 billionlawsuit against Keating and his associates alleging fraud andracketeering.   However, they could not dismiss Keating until they obtained theapproval of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, which has a 45 percentinterest in the resort and the right to block management changes,Whitney said. The office, based in London, makes real estateinvestments on behalf of the Kuwaiti government, he said.   The RTC named Hans Turnovszky, formerly director of a ski resortin Vail, Colo., as manager of the Phoenician.   Although Keating drew no salary as manager of the Phoenician, hecontinues to receive a $400,000-a-year salary as chairman ofAmerican Continental. He is scheduled to testify before the Housebanking panel on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
