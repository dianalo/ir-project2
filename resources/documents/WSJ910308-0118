That's the simple question Republican Senator John Warnerof Virginia is asking with his just-proposed Missile DefenseAct of 1991. His bombshell would let the U.S. develop andtest missile defenses regardless of the restrictions of theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The treaty's ban on deployinglarge-scale defenses would still stand, but at least the U.S.would be able to develop defenses without interference.</LP><TEXT>   The ABM treaty, an artifact of the Cold War's nuclearneurosis, has stood in the way of the ability to defend theU.S. mainland from incoming missiles since 1972. Mr. Warner,the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, issensibly saying that a new era demands new thinking.   Mr. Warner's proposal has already sent political debrisscattering all over Washington. Democrats who opposedefending the U.S. mainland against missile attacks have beenhiding for years behind the ABM Treaty; now they're pleadingwith Mr. Warner to kill his bill lest they have to, yikes,vote on it. The White House is also strangely quiet, thoughit claims to support strategic defense. Mr. Warner hopes toattach his idea as an amendment to the Desert Storm financingbill, so everyone will get a chance to come out of hiding andvote.   No one doubts that ballistic missiles are a growingthreat, even to the continental U.S. Saddam Hussein's Scud isprimitive compared with future varieties. As technologyadvances, so will range and accuracy. Nuclear and biologicalwarheads will come sooner or later. The CIA says between 15and 20 developing countries will have ballistic missiles bythe year 2000; at least six will have missiles with a rangeof 3,400 miles. Even if a missile is never fired, the merethreat would enhance a future Saddam's influence and leverageover a defenseless United States.   As a response, the ABM Treaty might as well be the horsecavalry. In 1972, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. could only reach an&quot;interim agreement&quot; limiting offensive weapons, so theyagreed to limit defenses permanently. We never liked this MAD-- mutual assured destruction -- logic, but it's suicide in aworld with missiles becoming as common as aircraft. The ideathat signing a treaty is adequate protection against futureSaddams is the sort of thing that only the Arms ControlAssociation could believe.   The ABM treaty limits the U.S. to 100 interceptors at asingle site. It inhibits, if not proscribes, tests in space.It even complicates life for the heroic Patriot. Because ofABM, a U.S. space sensor could be used to detect a Scudlaunch, but not to track or practice &quot;battle management.&quot;Those duties now have to be passed down to a radar on theground. Space tracking and management might have allowed anearlier Patriot interception and prevented the Dhahran Scudtragedy that killed 28 soldiers.   Some will ask how the U.S. can abrogate a treaty, but theABM Treaty itself says either side can stand down from itwith only six months' notice. In fact, the Soviets just mightwant to stand down themselves. They already have a limiteddefense deployed around Moscow, and they're closer to theworst Scud threats than we are. Senior Soviet military menhave said as much.   Senator Warner's bold stroke gets past the lawyers' talkabout treaty &quot;interpretation&quot; to the main point: Will theU.S. be defended, or not?</TEXT></DOC>
