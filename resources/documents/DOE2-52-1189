The surrogate is comprisedof 14 pure hydrocarbons and formulated based on the distillation curveand compound of the distillate parent. In previous work, the atomizationperformance (evaluated in terms of the atomization quality in an isothermalchamber), and the combustor performance (evaluated in terms of the velocityand thermal fields in a spray fueled combustor) were found to be equivalentfor the parent and surrogate JP-4. The sooting performance of the twofuels is addressed, as well as two reference fuels (a JP-5 and isooctane)of purposefully disparate properties. The sooting performance of theparent and surrogate JP-4 are nearly identical, and distinctly differentfrom that of either the JP-5 or the isooctane. The surrogate represents,as a result, an attractive fuel blend for the study of fuel compositionaleffects on the sooting performance of petroleum fuels in spray fueledcombustor.</TEXT></DOC>
