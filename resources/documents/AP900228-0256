(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of thousands of dollars in bankloans to Rep. Harold Ford were nothing more than ``a shell game''to hide political payoffs, a prosecutor said today at the openingof Ford's bank fraud trial.   But Ford's attorney said the loans from Butcher brother bankswere legitimate loans that Ford fully intended to repay, and he hasrepaid.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Humble said the bogus loans,eventually totaling some $1.5 million, were to pay Ford forpolitical and personal influence on behalf of former Tennesseebankers Jake Butcher and C.H. Butcher Jr.   ``The Butchers wanted him to use that power for their owninterests ... so they lent him money,'' Humble said in his openingargument. ``There was no way Harold Ford could repay this money. Heknew it. The Butchers knew it.   ``The only thing he could give was his political influence andhe did.''   He said that what appeared to be loans were actually payoffs.``It was not intended that Harold Ford pay this money back,''Humble said,   Humble said Ford began receiving money from the Butcher brothersin 1972 when he was a state representative with little money orpersonal property.   As Ford's political power grew, the Butcher payoffs alsoincreased in size and in the 1980s he received one loan for$350,000, the prosecutor said.   Defense attorney William McDaniels responded to the government'scharges by proclaiming his client's innocence, calling the case``an attack on Harold Ford personally. It is an attack on hispolitical life.''   ``They were not phony loans,'' McDaniels said. ``They wereintended to be repaid.''   The $350,000 loan, at issue in 11 of the 19 criminal countsagainst Ford, was issued by C.H. Butcher's now-defunct SouthernIndustrial Banking Corp. to a company called Tenn-Ford Inc.   The government contends Tenn-Ford was a sham company, but Fordsays the loan went through Tenn-Ford to the family funeral home,N.J. Ford andamp; Son's Funeral Parlor. In his opening statement,McDaniels said Ford was not responsible for the loan.   After SIBC went bust in 1983, Ford acted as majority stockholderin the funeral home while dealing with a bankruptcy trustee tosettle the SIBC loan for $25,000.   Ford is charged with conspiracy, bank fraud and mail fraud.   He is on trial with three co-defendants, former Butcheraccountant David Crabtree and lawyers Douglas Beaty and KarlSchledwitz.   The four were indicted in Knoxville in April 1987, and the trialwas moved to Memphis at Ford's request.   Ford, the only black member of Tennessee's congressionaldelegation, contends he was indicted in Knoxville because EastTennessee is heavily Republican and primarily white.   Ford's congressional district, which includes most of Memphis,is two-thirds black. He was first elected to Congress in 1974.   The jury has eight black members and four whites. One of thejury's two alternates is white, the other black.</TEXT></DOC>
