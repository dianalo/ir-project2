The report is the first time researchers have claimedsuccess in treating a form of hepatitis that afflicts about5% of the world's population. It is the most serious form ofhepatitis in that many infected persons develop a chronicform of hepatitis in which the virus continues to multiply inthe liver for years afterward, often leading to cirrhosis orliver cancer.</LP><TEXT>   The researchers reported that daily injections ofinterferon for 16 weeks stopped the hepatitis B virus frommultiplying in 40% of the patients who had suffered a chronicstate of active virus infection and hepatitis for as long asseven years.   Most of the patients who were successfully treatedapparently became &quot;silent&quot; or inactive carriers of thehepatitis B virus. But in 10% of the patients, most of whomhad had hepatitis B for less than two years, the interferontreatment appeared to eliminate the virus, the researchersreported.   &quot;We can cure people who might otherwise have a lifelonginfection with serious consequences if we get to them earlyenough,&quot; said Robert P. Perrillo, associate professor ofmedicine at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Perrilloheaded the team of scientists from a dozen medical schoolsand Schering-Plough who tested the interferon treatment.   Hepatitis B, once known as serum hepatitis, is transmittedsexually, through contaminated needles, through bloodtransfusions or from infected mother to child. It differsfrom hepatitis A, which is usually transmitted insewage-contaminated food. In the U.S., hepatitis B afflictsless than 1% of the population and is most often seen insexually promiscuous people, homosexual males, drug addicts,health care workers and infants born to mothers who arecarriers. In parts of Africa and Asia, however, hepatitis Bafflicts and is carried by about 20% of the population.   The report, published in this week's issue of the NewEngland Journal of Medicine, is the second coup in as manydays for Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b, which it sellsunder the brand name Intron A. Tuesday, an advisory group ofmedical experts recommended that the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration approve the company's request to sell Intron Afor the treatment of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis, acatchall designation for hepatitis in which blood tests failto detect the A or B virus.   A company spokesman said Schering-Plough applied to theFDA last October for clearance to make claims that Intron Awas effective in hepatitis B but hasn't yet received suchapproval. It took 13 months for the approval of Intron A'suse in non-A, non-B hepatitis.   The interferon treatment isn't cheap. The Schering-Ploughspokesman said that the average retail cost to the patientwould be about $5,000 for the full 16-week course of shotsused in the hepatitis B experiment.   Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b is one of twogenetically engineered interferons on the market. RocheHoldings Ltd.'s Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., sellsinterferon alfa-2a, which has some slight moleculardifferences from the Schering-Plough product. Bothinterferons are sold for the treatment of a type of leukemiaand for the Kaposi's sarcoma cancer that hits many patientswith acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   The tests of interferon alfa-2b in hepatitis B involved169 patients who had had chronic hepatitis B for at least sixmonths. Because the outward clinical symptoms of the diseasevary widely from none to severe fatigue, the diagnosis ofhepatitis B was confirmed in liver biopsies and by bloodtests that indicated the virus was actively multiplying inthe liver.   In the experiment, 85 of the patients were taught to givethemselves daily shots of five million units of interferonfor 16 weeks. Periodic blood tests over the following monthsindicated that in 31 of these patients, the virus had quitmultiplying in the liver. In addition, the blood tests on 10of the patients indicated the virus had disappeared.   By contrast, of 43 patients whose daily shots were of aplacebo or inert substance, only three showed a spontaneousloss of virus multiplication, and blood tests indicated allcontinued to harbor the virus. Another set of 41 patientsreceived only one million units of interferon daily. In thisgroup the virus became inactive in seven and disappeared inone patient.   Half of the patients receiving the maximum five millionunits of interferon also had been pretreated with a steroidhormone that had shown some benefit in other forms ofhepatitis. The steroid treatment, however, seemed to makelittle difference in the overall results.   So far, only two patients have experienced a reactivationof the virus, although the researchers cautioned that along-term follow-up is needed to determine the treatment'sefficacy and to find out whether it reduces the risk ofcirrhosis and liver cancer.   The major adverse effects of the interferon treatment werechanges in appetite, insomnia, acne and flu-like symptomssuch as fatigue, fever and headache.</TEXT></DOC>
