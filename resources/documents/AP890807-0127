National Security Council adviser, Rafael Ileto told reporters,``We are ready for talks now.'' He said the United States shouldpropose a date for the beginning of negotiations.   ``The council examined the security arrangements between the twocountries, particularly the U.S. Military Bases Agreement, whichexpires in September 1991,'' Ileto said.   ``It noted the need for the early resolution of the bases issueand decided to speed up the completion of plans for the alternativeuses of the U.S. military facilities.''   The United States maintains six bases in the Philippines,including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base. They areamong the largest U.S. military garrisons outside the continentalUnited States.   Under the Philippine constitution any extension of the basesmust come under a bilateral treaty subject to approval bytwo-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to theinstallations is strong.   President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether she supportsan extension. In October the United States and the Philippinesreached an agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 inreturn for $962 million in U.S. military and economic aid over twoyears.   The two countries are expected to begin preliminary talks on anew treaty later this year. Mrs. Aquino is expected to discuss theissue when she visits Washington, probably in November.   About 40,000 American troops, civilian workers and militarydependents are stationed at the facilities.   Opponents of the bases have suggested the facilities could beused for commercial ship repair, export processing zones andindustrial parks to soften the economic effects of any U.S. troopwithdrawal.   On Friday, Singapore's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,George Yeo, told parliament that the island nation wanted theUnited States to maintain its military presence in the region andhad offered to host some facilities.   Yeo's statement was seen as an attempt by Singapore to make iteasier for the Manila government to extend the bases agreement. ThePhilippines has complained that other non-communist Southeast Asiannations were unwilling to share the political burden of hosting thebases.</TEXT></DOC>
