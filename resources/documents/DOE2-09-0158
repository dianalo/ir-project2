Kerr-McGeeCorp. installed a programmable logic controller (PLC) system on its HighIsland 22-A gas processing facility in the Gulf of Mexico in December1986 (Fig. 1). The PLC was used to implement a complete platform safetymonitoring and control system that normally has been implemented offshoreusing pneumatic equipment. Here is why the PLC system was chosen, howthe control system was designed, and how it interfaces with the platformprocess equipment end devices.</TEXT></DOC>
