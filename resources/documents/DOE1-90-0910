FIA presents a kinetic methodof microchemical analysis in flow-type systems, which is based on theformation of sample concentration gradient in laminar flow of carrier(reactant). FIA characteristics when determining B, Cd, Ce, I/sub 2/,Mo, Tb and other elements in aqueous solutions, are given. FIA is shownto be the cheapest and most productive method of automated high-volumeanalysis of liquid.</TEXT></DOC>
