Botha recommended that thegovernment liberalize legislation regulating where people ofthe various races can live, but it stopped short of callingfor the abolition of the practice, which is one of thecornerstones of apartheid.   Anti-apartheid groups in South Africa criticized the committee's report for not going far enough, while the pro-apartheid Conservative Party rejected it as a precursor to full integration.    The release of the report by the President's Council comes as the U.S., the European Community and the Commonwealth are separately reviewing the impact of their various international economic sanctions on the South African government. The Pretoria government, which claims that the international community has largely ignored its past reforms, hopes that the report will be viewed as a genuine effort to reform and thus will stave off further sanctions.    After three years of deliberation, the council proposed amending the Group Areas Act so that local communities can decide for themselves whether to open their residential areas for ownership and occupation by all race groups. It also recommended that all properties zoned for business, industrial or religious use should be opened to all races. At the same time, however, the council reaffirmed the philosophy behind the government's principle of segregation, acknowledging the need for the preservation of group rights and minority protection.    The council's report, which was authored primarily by members of the ruling National Party, is a barometer of how the government interprets the &quot;mandate for reform&quot; it claims it received from white voters in the May general election. Political analysts say the report indicates that the government is willing to fine-tune and update various aspects of apartheid, but not to abolish them outright.    Both black and white anti-apartheid activists harshly criticized the council's report on these grounds, saying that apartheid legislation must be scrapped, not amended. It was the second reform move to be coolly received by the black community in the past two weeks; the government's offer to let blacks elect their own representatives to a national advisory council was widely dismissed because many popular black leaders are in jail under the state of emergency.    The Progressive Federal Party, which is the liberal opposition in the white parliament, rejected the council's Group Areas report, saying the recommendations are &quot;a compromise between gross racial discrimination and vague segregation.&quot; Reflecting the polarization among South Africa's whites, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which is the strongest opposition party in parliament, rejected the report for a quite different reason. It said the recommendations, if adopted, &quot;will lead to a fully integrated South Africa.&quot;    While the recommendations would effectively legalize existing so-called gray areas -- big-city white neighborhoods that over time have been populated by blacks and people of mixed race in defiance of the Group Areas Act -- it is unlikely that they would bring about many changes in South Africa's municipal landscape. Many local governments are controlled by either the National or Conservative party and in the past these town councils have shown no willingness to open up residential areas to all races. </TEXT></DOC>
