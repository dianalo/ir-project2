Lawmakers voted 64-25 to reject an attempt to remove the death penalty provision from the Senate's wide-ranging anti-drug bill and put in its place a provision calling for a mandatory life sentence without parole. The amendment, offered by Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) also would have deleted the bill's minimum penalty for drug-related killings of 20 years in prison.    The action came as the senators began consideration of their version of the anti-drug legislation, which the Senate is expected to pass, perhaps as soon as today. A House-Senate conference would have to reconcile it with a bill passed last month by the House before the measure could go to President Reagan.    The bill is one of the last remaining items keeping lawmakers on Capitol Hill more than a week past their adjournment target. As eager as they are to get home to campaign for next month's elections, they are reluctant to face the voters without legislation that responds to election-year pressure to take a tough stand against illegal drugs.    That pressure was reflected in the lopsided margin by which lawmakers turned back Mr. Hatfield's amendment. &quot;The death penalty is a weapon that is warranted and long overdue to fight the butchery that is occurring on America's streets,&quot; said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.).    But Sen. Hatfield argued that &quot;the death penalty fits nicely into the 1980s trend of combating complex, intractable problems with quick solutions and effortless remedies.&quot;    Earlier this year, the Senate voted 65-29 to approve separate legislation permitting the execution of drug-related killers. The House didn't act on that measure, but included the provision in its anti-drug bill.    Last night, the Senate also voted 88-0 to adopt an amendment offered by Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) that would establish a civil penalty of as much as $10,000 for possession of small amounts of such illicit drugs as marijuana or cocaine. Federal prosecutors would have the option of seeking a civil fine against those who hadn't previously been convicted of a drug-related felony. The House bill contains a similar provision that gives prosecutors less flexibility.    The nearly 600-page Senate bill was drafted by lawmakers of both parties during four months of negotiations, bypassing the Senate's normal process of committee consideration. It seeks to boost the attack on illicit drugs in the U.S. on many fronts, including blocking their entrance into the country, educating young people to their dangers and treating those who have become addicted to them.    The legislation would strengthen record-keeping requirements for large cash transactions at financial institutions to combat money laundering, and it would toughen related penalties. The legislation also would make it easier to prosecute money-laundering operations turned up by undercover investigations. The House bill contains similar provisions.    In addition, the Senate measure would require random drug testing for certain transportation workers and would toughen criminal penalties for those operating an airliner, bus, truck or train under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs. The House bill doesn't contain similar provisions.    Not covered by either bill, however, is how to pay for the programs that would be established. Lawmakers say that, if fully funded, the Senate measure would result in additional outlays of about $500 million this fiscal year, but concede that no more than $450 million is available under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    &quot;We can't do all the funding this year,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). &quot;The important thing is to get the bill into place.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
