In documents filed on Friday, Liggett Group Inc., PhilipMorris Cos.' Philip Morris Inc. unit and Lorillard, a LoewsCorp. subsidiary, supported a petition seeking Supreme Courtreview filed by their opponent in the case, AntonioCipollone.</LP><TEXT>   The case, stemming from the death of Mr. Cipollone's wifefrom lung cancer in 1984, has attracted widespread attentionbecause the first trial resulted in the only jury verdictrequiring a cigarette manufacturer to pay damages torelatives of a smoker who died of cancer.   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia overturned the$400,000 verdict and ordered a new trial last year. But theappeals court barred Mr. Cipollone from pursuing any claimsagainst the tobacco companies that occurred after 1966, theyear Congress required warning labels on cigarette packs andin cigarette advertisements. The U.S. Supreme Court refusedto review the case at that time.   But Mr. Cipollone's new petition argues that a recentruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court on the same issuecreates a conflict with the federal appeals court decision.In July, the New Jersey court ruled that warnings oncigarette packages don't protect tobacco makers from productliability suits. The tobacco companies in that case decidednot to seek Supreme Court review.   Cynthia Walters, a Short Hills, N.J., lawyer for Mr.Cipollone, said she hopes that because both sides aresupporting the petition the Supreme Court will take the case.   The appeals court ruling in the Cipollone case hasdominated the debate over whether the warning labels immunizecigarette makers against claims dating since 1966. The issueis crucial to tobacco liability suits because the number ofpossible pre-1966 claims is diminishing as the populationages.   In court papers, the companies said that 45 suits arepending against manufacturers on similar claims and that theissue is currently before three state supreme courts.Allowing juries to decide on the adequacy of the warninglabel threatens the uniformity Congress sought, the companiessaid.   &quot;While we disagree with the plaintiff on almost everythingin the world . . . upon reflection we decided that we agreeit is an appropriate time to have the Supreme Court resolvethe conflict once and for all,&quot; said David Kentoff, aWashington lawyer representing Philip Morris. Liggett Groupdeclined to comment further. A lawyer for Loews could not bereached.   &quot;I'm surprised the companies are doing this becausethey're doing well in the circuit courts,&quot; said VictorSchwartz, a Washington product liability lawyer. In recentyears, five federal courts and the Minnesota Supreme Courthave ruled that the warning act protects the tobaccocompanies from liability. State courts in New Jersey andTexas have ruled the other way.   Athena Mueller, a lawyer for Action on Smoking and Health,an anti-smoking group, said that even if Mr. Cipollone losesat the high court, plaintiffs could sue tobacco companiesclaiming that their ads &quot;are so psychologically powerful thatthey negate the effect of any warning and open the companiesup to liability.&quot;   But Mr. Schwartz said that if the Supreme Court rulesagainst the plaintiffs, &quot;tobacco litigation would almost bedead.&quot;   ---   PUBLIC SCHOOL can't ban anti-abortion fundraiser, courtsays.   The federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled that bypreviously allowing a religious program on its premises, theschool had made itself a &quot;limited public forum&quot; for otherreligious uses.   The Owego Apalachin Central School District in upstate NewYork refused to rent out a school auditorium to Birthright ofOwego Inc., an anti-abortion pregnancy counselingorganization. Birthright wanted to sponsor a magic-showfundraiser featuring a performer from Youtharama NortheasternPennsylvania's Youth for Christ Inc., an evangelicalChristian group.   The school argued that it didn't have to rent theauditorium to the group because of the program's religiouscontent. But the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals saidthat by allowing another group to stage a Christmas programto raise money for needy children at the school three yearsbefore, the school had opened the way for religious programs.The appeals panel agreed with Birthright and Youth for Christthat the school had violated their free-speech rights anddiscriminated on the basis of religion.   The court ordered the school to make the auditoriumequally available to all religious programs.   &quot;In a limited public forum, government is free to impose ablanket exclusion on certain types of speech, but once itallows expressive activities of a certain genre, it may notselectively deny access for other activities of that genre,&quot;the court said. &quot;The Christmas program thus created at leasta limited public forum for fundraisers with religiousthemes.&quot;   John Hogan, an attorney in Binghamton, N.Y, for the schooldistrict, said school officials will review the decision todecide what to do next. Mr. Hogan said that one option is toprohibit all religious programs. But the court didn't addresswhether such a ban would be legal.   An attorney for the religious groups couldn't be reached.   ---   AMERICAN-ARAB GROUP sues Pan Am for allegeddiscrimination.   In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, theAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee accused Pan AmCorp. of singling out passengers who appear to be Arab andsubjecting them to unlawful detention and questioning. Thesuit, filed on behalf of the committee by the American CivilLiberties Union, cited examples of American citizens andresidents who say they were detained or questioned asterrorist suspects because of their ethnicity.   The airline previously was sued for allegedly barringIraqi nationals from its flights. Shortly after that suit wasfiled, Pan Am announced that its current policy was to allowIraqi passengers.   A spokesman for the airline couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   NOTED: William A.
