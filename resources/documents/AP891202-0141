He departed from a prepared text to comment before a gatheringof 2,500 cheering, pro-government women, ``Within years, not many,Chileans will be asking for the military regime to return.''   Pinochet did not elaborate.   He is scheduled to surrender power March 11 to a civilianpresident chosen in the Dec. 14 election. Most opinion polls favorPatricio Aylwin, candidate of a coalition of 17 centrist andmoderate left-wing parties, to win.   When Pinochet spoke of stepping down, some women pleaded withhim to stay in office.   The 73-year-old general and army commander responded: ``Don'tforget that I am a soldier, and since the people asked me to leave,I'm leaving.''   Pinochet came to power in a bloody 1973 coup that deposed theelected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.   He had to call this month's election after voters in an October1988 referendum massively rejected a military proposal to extendhis rule until 1997.   Pinochet will remain army commander after leaving thepresidency, as allowed by the 1980 constitution written by hisgovernment.   He said that as commander, ``I'll be watching what happens inour country, not as a bird of prey, but with a wish ofcollaborating.''</TEXT></DOC>
