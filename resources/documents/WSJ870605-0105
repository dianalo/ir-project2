Rhoda H. Karpatkin, who runs Consumer Reports magazine, is betting they do. The magazine is altering its steady diet of articles that evaluate goods and services to include articles on social issues. This month, for example, it began a three-part series on the plight of the so-called working poor. The two families profiled in the issue can only dream of buying the mutual funds, pickup trucks and dishwashers rated on adjacent pages. For them, the magazine says, comparison shopping is choosing between food and health care.    Ms. Karpatkin sees the move as a return to the 51-year-old magazine's working-class roots. But the effort is creating a stir and could backfire. The magazine's readership has become more affluent, as reflected by its increased attention to rating big-ticket, discretionary items like video equipment. Circulation has soared in recent years largely because of increasing readership among conspicuously consuming baby boomers -- a group whose enthusiasm for social causes has been waning.    &quot;I did not subscribe to be subjected to a slanted liberal diatribe,&quot; one reader wrote recently. Said another of a recent article on AIDS: &quot;I fail to see what product was being evaluated.&quot;    This isn't the first time advocacy has been an issue at Consumer Reports. In the 1970s, consumer activist Ralph Nader quit the magazine's board because he didn't think it was doing enough to attack social issues. The magazine also has been criticized by some of its own staffers, who call it &quot;Consumer Beautiful&quot; for its reviews of the latest in upscale consumer equipment.    For the 56-year-old Ms. Karpatkin, controversy at Consumer Reports isn't new. Besides dealing with chronic deficits in past years, she also has had to contend with labor discord as executive director of Consumers Union, the nonprofit foundation that publishes the magazine. A lawyer, Ms. Karpatkin has held the post since 1974; she previously served as the foundation's outside attorney.    She says she has long wanted to undertake such projects as the poverty series, but says the magazine didn't have the financial wherewithal to do so until recently. Consumer Reports' circulation has now reached a record 3.8 million, up from 2.6 million in 1983. The magazine currently has a surplus of $6.1 million, compared with a 1983 deficit of $7.1 million.    Among other things, the broader coverage reflects Ms. Karpatkin's personal interests. Each week on a New York radio show, she serves as the liberal counterweight to Mobil Corp.'s outspoken public relations man, Herbert Schmertz. She does volunteer work at a shelter for the homeless on New York's Upper West Side.    She also established a lobbying group, the Institute for Consumer Policy Research, which last year sponsored a conference on poverty that led to this year's magazine articles. The institute -- and perhaps the magazine -- next plans to take on the issue of adequate health insurance for the poor.    Meanwhile, just as the poverty series hits newsstands, Ms. Karpatkin finds herself embroiled in a labor dispute over her proposal to create a merit pay system for workers rather than grant an across-the-board increase. The dispute with the Newspaper Guild has led to an AFL-CIO call for a boycott of Consumer Reports. There also have been charges, which Ms. Karpatkin denies, that she is trying to bust the union. So far, only a handful of subscribers have canceled because of the boycott, she says.    The labor dispute has been particularly touchy because of Consumer Reports' origins as a backer of labor. Founded in 1936, it began as a guide to household necessities and promoted &quot;a decent standard of living for all consumers.&quot; Openly pro labor, the magazine then discouraged consumers from buying goods made by companies it felt had poor working conditions.    State Assemblyman Frank Barbaro, a liberal Brooklyn Democrat, is one critic of Ms. Karpatkin's stance with the union. &quot;Consumers Union has always been the showcase on how to get along with workers,&quot; he says, &quot;until this Karpatkin came along.&quot;    Ms. Karpatkin says she hasn't been affected by the squabble and is going about her business as usual. She maintains that the magazine needs to build a financial cushion against the next recession. During the last one, in the early 1980s, &quot;Our balance sheet was a disaster,&quot; she says. &quot;We were running out of money.&quot; When consumers stop buying, they stop buying Consumer Reports, she asserts. &quot;We absolutely must squirrel away (money) to ride out a recession.&quot;    If future social policy articles in the magazine get a mixed reception from readers it may be because many subscribers are more conservative than the Consumer Reports staff. Irwin Landau, Consumer Reports editor, says he realizes many readers are &quot;to the right of us&quot; politically, but says, &quot;We don't pay too much attention to that.&quot;    He is &quot;nervous,&quot; however, about mixing advocacy and journalism. It hasn't gotten out of hand, Mr. Landau says, but he adds, &quot;There is a certain amount of subtle pressure . . . to write about subjects that are of interest&quot; to Ms. Karpatkin's lobbying group. &quot;I don't want that tail wagging this dog.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
