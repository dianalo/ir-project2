By using cloned DNA probes, the authors have characterizedthe following five different partial deletions of the factor VIII genefrom a panel of 83 patients with hemophilia A: (i) a 7-kilobase (kb)deletion that eliminates exon 6; (ii) a 2.5-kb deletion that eliminates5' sequences of exon 14; (iii) a deletion of at least 7 kb that eliminatesexons 24 and 25; (iv) a deletion of at least 16 kb that eliminates exons23-25; and (v) a 5.5-kb deletion that eliminates exon 22. The first fourdeletions are associated with severe hemophilia A. By contrast, the lastdeletion is associated with moderate disease, possibly because of in-framesplicing from adjacent exons. None of those patients with partial genedeletions had circulating inhibitors to factor VIII. One deletion occurredde novo in a germ cell of the maternal grandmother, while a second deletionoccurred in a germ cell of the maternal grandfather. These observationsdemonstrate that de novo deletions of X-linked genes can occur in eithermale or female gametes.</TEXT></DOC>
