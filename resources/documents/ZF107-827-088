 Both Apple andAdobe had previously announced plans for competing System-level software toproduce scalable on-screen fonts (see &quot;Fine Print,&quot; September '89): Apple'soutline-font technology, due as part of System 7 (to be released in 1990),and the Adobe Type Manager (ATM), slated to ship in October '89.andM;Neither product will provide a universal solution: The outline-fonttechnology will be free but will work only with fonts in Apple's new SFNTformat.andP;  ATM works with the established Type 1 font families and adds scaledtext-output capabilities to many non-PostScript printers, but it costs $99and requires users to purchase a set of fonts for each Mac, rather than foreach printer.andM;The situation became more complex when Apple and Microsoft announced theywere swapping software technology (see NewsLine in this issue):  Apple wouldprovide Microsoft with its outline-font technology (which Microsoft could usein its OS/2 Presentation Manager operating system for IBM PCs), while Applewould gain rights to a PostScript clone owned by Microsoft.andP;  Bothtechnologies would be provided royalty-free to interested third-partydevelopers.andM;The software swap hit Adobe -- which built its business on the combination ofPostScript and fonts -- with a one-two punch.andP;  Almost immediately, Adoberesponded by announcing that it would open up its previously proprietaryencryption standard for Type 1 fonts.andP;  In the last year, Adobe has licensedthis technology to many font vendors, but it will now be free to all comers.andM;With an open standard, Adobe hopes to retain its position as the premier fontsupplier for the Macintosh (with the possibility of an OS/2 version of ATM inthe wings) by capitalizing on its installed base of 550 different fonts and22 million typefaces sold.andP;  But Adobe faces a serious challenge from Apple,Microsoft, and possibly IBM, which are all officially sanctioning a newstandard.andM;ATM will be the first salvo fired in the font wars, constituting the firstproduct choice Mac users will have to consider.andP;  Here are some of the issuesand answers surrounding ATM:andM;What does ATM do?andM;ATM is a utility that automatically builds type at any size, based onPostScript outline fonts.andP;  Until now, you needed both outline and bit-mappedfonts if you wanted a WYSIWYG representation of type on-screen or on anon-PostScript printer, such as the dot-matrix ImageWriter II,Hewlett-Packard's DeskWriter, or Apple's LaserWriter SC.andP;  ATM extends thereach of outline fonts to screen displays and non-PostScript priters bycreating bit maps from the information contained in outline fonts, limitedonly by the constraints of the application you're using it with.andM;Why would you want ATM?andM;You want ATM if you primarily use Adobe-compatible (Type 1) fonts and wantaccurate on-screen font representation.andP;  You also want ATM if you have anon-PostScript printer and want to print Adobe fonts at any size withoutencountering the notorious jaggies.andP;  (The initial release of ATM won't beable to work with third-party fonts that aren't type 1.)andP;  Adobe didn'toriginally plan to have ATM work with high-resolution non-PostScriptprinters, because the result is something that, for text, is very competitivewith the PostScript printers -- and Adobe collects royalties on PostScriptprinters.andP;  But it also means an entirely new market will develop for Adobefonts: QuickDraw-printer owners.andM;What won't ATM do on aandM;QuickDraw printer?andM;PostScript graphics.andP;  And special typographic effects such as characterrotation also won't work with ATM until an application has been revised toaccommodate it.andP;  Adobe has already shown such a version of Illustrator 88,and other applications are expected to follow suit.andM;How much will ATM cost?andM;For $99, you get ATM and outline versions of the four original Laser-Writertypefaces: Times, Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol.andP;  For an additional $198(through the end of 1989 at least), you'll get the other fonts that currentlyship with most PostScript printers, including Apple's.andM;Sounds like a bargain so far, right?andP;  But if you want to install ATM on agroup of Macs that share PostScript printers, you also must buy individualcopies of all the fonts you plan to use with ATM -- one for each machine --because ATM won't work unless you have the outline version of that font inyour System Folder.andM;Will System 7 make ATM redundant?andM;Probably not.andP;  System 7's font outliner will work only with Apple's new SFNTfonts.andP;  ATM also uses less disk space and RAM because it requires only onesize for each font in the System.andP;  ATM runs (if only just barely) on a1-megabyte Mac with System 6.0 or later; Apple's comparable outline-fonttechnology will require 2 megabytes.andM;Although the transition may take some getting used to, the newfont-management options add up to greater font flexibility and freedom.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
