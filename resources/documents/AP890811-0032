(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Taunts of ``goat face'' caused a10-year-old boy to drop out of school in his Ecuador village, buthe's returning to classes next month _ with a new face.   Cesar Guachichulca was born with the left side of his facedeformed as a result of a rare birth defect, Goldenhar's syndrome.   Last week, surgeons at Cardinal Cushing Hospital in Brocktoncorrected his deformed eye, ear and jaw, as well as the V-shapedpatch of hair on his forehead that inspired his classmates' taunts.   ``We have a saying among our people, `Hope is the only thing youcan't lose,''' the boy's father, Bolivar, said through aninterpreter in Cesar's hospital room last week.   Then he began to cry and put his face down on a table.   ``I believe in God and I kept hoping for a miracle. Happinessdoesn't even say it. This is a miracle.''   Cesar, who his father and doctors said is normally talkative andarticulate, was subdued by the operation. Sitting in his room withbandages covering his swollen face, he pointed toward his fatherand said, ``I look like my daddy now.''   The boy's trip and surgery was sponsored in part by Por Cristo,a Brockton-based team of medical volunteers founded 10 years agowho have treated hundreds of children in Latin America. The BostonRed Sox baseball team also helped defray expenses.   Before he left Ecuador, Cesar spoke at length to reporters andthanked Por Cristo for ``the opportunity they've given me to be anormal child.''   He had been the top student at his school in the mountainvillage of San Pedro de la Bendita, but Cesar said he left``because the other children made fun of me.'' He will go back tothe third grade next month.   Bolivar Guachichulca works seven days a week as a state publicworks employee, earning $30 a month. He gets up at 4 a.m. every dayto take a two-hour bus ride to his job site. He takes off oneSunday a month to spend with his wife and five sons, of whom Cesaris the eldest.   The couple at first blamed themselves for Cesar's condition,Guachichulca said. Their other sons have no facial deformities.   ``The first question we had was why? Why did this happen to us?My wife was in tears at his birth,'' he said.   Some of the residents in the family's remote village thoughtCesar's deformities were caused by the devil.   When Cesar was 2, his father brought him to doctors near theirvillage.   ``They told me there was nothing they could do,'' Guachichulcasaid.   But he persisted for eight years to look for doctors who couldhelp.   `I'm like all parents. I want the best for my child,'' he said.``It only bothered him a little in the beginning but in the lasttwo years, it's bothered him a lot. He was ashamed of himself.''   Finally, he heard about Por Cristo. A women's auxiliaryorganization in Ecuador helped him contact the group.   He eventually traveled to the coastal city of Guayaquil to meetwith Martin Dunn, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who founded PorCristo and performed the surgery on Cesar.   ``Dr. Dunn was the first one to explain to us what it was andthat it wasn't our fault,'' said Guachichulca.   Cesar told reporters last month he wanted to be a priest. Butnow he says he will go back to Ecuador next month with new plans.   ``I want to be a doctor now,'' he said. ``I want to be able tohelp and operate on other children who have problems like I had.''</TEXT></DOC>
