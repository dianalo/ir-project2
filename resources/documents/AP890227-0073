RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling thatsomeone who plans a bank robbery but is arrested before actuallymoving toward the bank may not be convicted of violating a federallaw prohibiting attempted bank robbery.   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a JusticeDepartment appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bankrobbery conviction in a California case.   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to heararguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review.   The case stems from the arrest of Reginald Dean Still on Aug. 7,1985, in Roseville, Calif.   Responding to a tip from a passerby, police found Still sittingin a van parked some 200 feet from the Security Pacific Bank.   The van's motor was running when police arrived and Still put itin reverse and drove off. Police caught up with him and arrested him.   Police said he told them, ``You did a good job. You caught mefive minutes before I was going to rob a bank.''   He said he confessed because of incriminating evidence inside thevan _ including a blond wig, a phony bomb and a note demanding moneythat Still said he intended to present to a teller at a drive-upwindow.   Police said Still told them his confession was merely ``frostingon the cake'' because of the other evidence.   He was convicted in federal court of attempted bank robbery andinterstate transporation of a stolen vehicle _ the van he said heintended to use in the robbery. Still was sentenced to 15 years inprison.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the stolen vanconviction but threw out the conviction for attempted bank robbery.   ``Still's intent to rob the Security Pacific National Bank wasclearly established,'' the appeals court said.   But the ``facts do not establish either actual movement towardthe bank or actions that are analytically similar to suchmovement,'' the appeals court said. Without that, there can be noconviction for attempted bank robbery, it added.   Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court rulingestablishes a dangerous precedent.   ``Attempts are punished as a crime because of the great need tostop offenses from occurring,'' department lawyers said.   ``A robbery may be only moments away even though the robber hasnot yet begun to assault the bank,'' they continued. ``Societyshould be free to intervene in order not only to stop a crime fromcoming to pass, but also to punish the defendant for puttinginnocent parties at risk of the loss of their property, seriousinjury or death.''   The government's appeal said the 9th Circuit court ruling, whichis binding law in Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho,Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, is in conflict withother federal courts.   FBI statistics show that in 1987 nearly half of all robberies offederally insured financial institutions occurred in states withinthe 9th Circuit, the government said.   The case is U.S. vs. Still, 88-581.</TEXT></DOC>
