Minister Fotis Kouvelis said the decision will be made by thegovernment emerging from elections in October.   Mohammed Rashid, 39, is accused of planting a bomb on a Pan Amjumbo jet in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 otherpeople were wounded in the blast over Hawaii.   Greece's Supreme Court on May 12 upheld an extradition ordersought by the United States. But the justice minister has final sayon all extraditions.   U.S. officials have described the case as a test of Greece'swillingness to fight international terrorism.   The former socialist administration had postponed the decision onRashid until after June 18 general elections.   But after no party won a majority in the vote, the conservativeNew Democracy party and communist-led Coalition of the Left andProgress decided to govern together for three months.   Kouvelis is one of two ministers appointed by the communists. Theother is Interior Minister Nikos Kostandopoulos, a lawyer who foughtRashid's extradition case.   Rashid, held since his arrest at Athens airport in May 1988, wassentenced to eight months' jail on March 28 on charges of attemptingto escape after makeshift knives were found in his cell.   The Palestine Liberation Organization claims Rashid is an officerin its military branch called Mohammed Hamdan, 34. PLO officialsdeny charges he is a terrorist and describe the extradition requestas a plot to discredit them.</TEXT></DOC>
