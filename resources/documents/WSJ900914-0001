In the face of gathering opposition within Congress andfrom senior citizen's groups, there were reports from theclosed-door budget negotiations late yesterday thatnegotiators had scaled back initial plans to boost Medicarepremiums by as much as $3.9 billion next year and $40.8billion over five years.</LP><TEXT>   But the initial proposal, once nervously supported by bothDemocrats and Republicans at the budget summit, may havepoisoned the well for other efforts to make 33 millionelderly and disabled beneficiaries pay higher premiums fortheir federal health benefits.   &quot;This kind of proposal, even it's withdrawn, probablymakes it harder for the summiteers to encourage everyone todo their fair share&quot; as part of an effort to achieve $500billion in budget cuts over five years, said Martin Corry,director of federal relations at the American Association ofRetired Persons, the nation's largest senior-citizens group.   Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, said, &quot;We've beenanswering a steady stream of calls. People are incredulous.They just don't understand this.&quot;   The rapid response to the Medicare proposal, firstdescribed in press reports Wednesday, is only one of awidening tide of protests over the plans being worked out bybudget negotiators.   For example, all 34 members of the New York Housedelegation wrote Majority Leader Thomas Foley and MinorityLeader Robert Michel asking them to oppose a Republicaneffort to limit the deductibility of state and local taxes.   And George Gould, chief lobbyist for the NationalAssociation of Letter Carriers, said that the union isthreatening to stop making campaign contributions to membersof Congress who vote for a deficit-reduction measure thatincludes a proposal to slow the growth of federal pensions.Part of the budget plan, which is still subject to change,would cancel the next cost of living increase for federalemployees and hold future increases to less than the rate ofinflation.   The American Medical Association is worried about proposedMedicare cuts that could cost hospitals and doctors $3.4billion in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, and a total of$31.5 billion over five years. But one of the provisions thatirritates the AMA the most is a relatively low-cost change --a proposal to charge doctors $1 for each Medicare form theyfile by mail, rather than electronically. The $300 millionrevenue generator would hurt rural doctors in particular, theAMA argues. &quot;We definitely will oppose those kinds ofthings,&quot; an AMA official says.   Every deficit-reduction measure that's taken out of thepackage will have to be replaced with something else, unlessthe Congressional and White House negotiators trim theirtargets of $50 billion in cuts in fiscal 1991 and $500billion over five years.   Many analysts believe that substantial adjustments arenecessary to slow the rapidly growing cost of the $105billion-a-year Medicare program. But the politics aretreacherous.   &quot;I don't know how they could even consider a capital-gainstax cut when they're sticking it to seniors like this&quot; with aproposed premium increase, says William Ritz, public affairsdirector of the National Committee to Preserve SocialSecurity and Medicare. The committee led the fight to repealthe law extending Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses,along with the surtax the law imposed on some seniortaxpayers.</TEXT></DOC>
