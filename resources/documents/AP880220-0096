Washington last year provided more than $600 million in aid tothe centrist government fighting an 8-year-old war againstMarxist-led insurgents. Most of the aid was military or war-related.   Commander Roberto Roca, a member of the high command of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, said in an interviewwith the rebel radio station that U.S. personnel are becomingincreasingly involved in combat and repression.   He said that makes them more likely to suffer the consequencesof insurgent activity.   Roca's statement, broadcast by the rebels' Radio Venceremos, didnot appear to be a blanket threat against all Americans in ElSalvador. He referred to the 55 military advisers here trainingSalvadoran government troops and to what he said was a contingentof ``about 40 (American) civilians advising and directing therepression of the people's movement.''   ``This kind of personnel is also part of the counterinsurgencycampaign and because of that it will find itself increasingly theobject of popular combat,'' said Roca.   ``For us, the Americans have always been those responsible forthis war; they have always sustained the war against the Salvadoranpeople,'' he said. ``Consequently, the personnel they have fightinghere is a military objective of our forces.''   He claimed the U.S. military advisers stationed at theheadquarters of the 6th Infantry Brigade in Usulutan, 70 southeastof the capital San Salvador, took part in combat there Wednesday.   An estimated 600 guerrillas attacked the base and a nearbycotton cooperative in the rebel's biggest assault in 10 months.Eighteen people died in the fighting.   Col. Inocente Montano, commander of the 6th brigade, said therewere four U.S. advisers at the base when the rebels attacked. Hesaid the compound was never penetrated and that the advisers werenever in danger. But he added that ``they were ready, in case ofincursion, to help repel the attack.''   Regulations governing the conduct of U.S. advisers here prohibitthem from participation in combat except in self defense.   ``To the degree that the war's operation theater is widened, theAmerican advisers, the American personnel in those places ... willfind themselves increasingly up against direct militaryoperations,'' said Roca. ``That is to say their (the American)military personnel will be going home wounded, dead.''   Sgt. Gregory Fronius, the only military adviser to die in combathere, was killed in March of last year during a guerrilla attack onan army base in the northern province of Chalatenango.   The rebels assassinated a U.S. officer here in 1983 and killedfour U.S. Marine embassy guards, two American businessmen and sevenother people in a machine gun attack on a San Salvador cafe in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
