The space agency said negotiations will begin with Lockheed onthe details of a contract award for the new rocket. The contract isexpected to include an option for the production of up to 44 motorsets. Total contract value is estimated at about $1.1 billion overseven years.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans todevelop a new, more powerful solid rocket to use with the shuttlein the mid-1990s. The new rocket is expected to be safer and morereliable than the solid rocket now used with the shuttle. The newrocket also has a design goal of being able to put an additional12,000 pounds of payload into orbit.   NASA announced earlier that facilities for production of the newrocket motor will be built at Yellow Creek, a site in extremenortheastern Mississippi near the town of Iuka. The site currentlyis owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, but will be transferredto NASA.   New testing facilities for the new rocket are planned for theJohn C. Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss., the spaceagency said.   NASA said the rocket contract with Lockheed will require thecompany to produce the first 12 operational motors for use in aflight verification program consisting of six shuttle missions. Thefirst flight set of rocket motors is scheduled for delivery in1994, and NASA is to phase the new rocket motor into the shuttlefleet over the next three years. After about 1997, the old shuttlesolid-fueled rocket, manufacturered by Morton Thiokol Co. in Utah,will no longer be used.   Lockheed is teamed with Aeroject Space Booster Co. ofSacramento, Calif., as its principal subcontractor for the rocketmotor, and with Rust International of Birmingham, Ala., as thefacility contractor.</TEXT></DOC>
