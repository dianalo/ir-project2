GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amnesty International charged onWednesday that Burma's military rulers have arrested thousands ofpeople, carried out unfair trials and are holding politicalprisoners.   The London-based human rights group called for the commutationof 100 death sentences that have been handed down by the martiallaw government and for the release of all political prisoners.   The Amnesty report, received in Bangkok, listed 107 ``prisonersof conscience'' and other political prisoners believed still indetention. Amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as peopledetained solely for peacefully expressing their beliefs.   The list of prisoners included the nation's top oppositionleader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as a Buddhist monk and anovelist. Most on the list were students and members of Suu Kyi'sNational League for Democracy.   Amnesty quoted unnamed sources as saying more than 3,000 peoplehad been arrested since July 1989. The organization said it couldnot confirm this number because it had not been able to visitBurma, but it documented the arrests of a number of politicalopponents to the regime.   ``Amnesty believes that arrests during this period (after lateJuly) numbered in the thousands,'' the report said.   Last month, the Rangoon government announced it had arrested1,087 people for political offenses since September 1988, when agroup of military leaders brutally crushed a nationwidepro-democracy uprising. The leaders set up a 17-man militarycouncil and declared martial law.   But the formation of more than 200 political parties has beenallowed and the military is promising general elections May 27 ofnext year.   The house arrest last July of Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, leaders of theNational League For Democracy, along with other senior members ofthe pro-democracy party led many Western diplomats in Rangoon toconclude that free elections were unlikely.   The government also has said it had handed down 100 deathsentences, many by special military tribunals. Amnesty describedsome of the trials as unfair by international standards.   Similar charges have been made in recent months by the UnitedStates, which also claims some political detainess have died undertorture. Rangoon has denied this.   In a speech Nov. 10 Gen. Saw Maung, who heads the militarygovernment, said citizens had nothing to be afraid of ``unless, ofcourse, you break the law.''   ``There are accusations that we are following the methods of theJapanese Kempetai. That is not true. If they say we use Gestapomethods then they are wrong too,'' Saw Maung told a graduatingclass at Burma's National Defense College. The Japanese secretpolice Kempetai and the Nazi's Gestapo employed torture andcommitted other atrocities during World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
