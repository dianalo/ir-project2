SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   December's record deep freeze has Easternersand Midwesterners clogging phone lines at desert resorts andUniversal Studios as they seek escape in the Southern Californiasun.   ``We have an 800 number to call for information about PalmSprings and it's been ringing off the hook. And most of the callshave been from back East,'' said Carolyn Patten of the Palm Springscity tourism office.   ``They want to know `Can we get some sun?' They are so tired ofthe snow. I don't know how they're going to feel in March, but theyhate it now,'' Patten said Thursday.   It's too early to cite statistics, but a survey of resort hotelsin the Coachella Valley surrounding Palm Springs indicated thiswinter tourist season looks like a scorcher, with a hot streak ofearly bookings.   ``The phones are just going crazy on us,'' said Jim Lopez,marketing director at the 860-room Marriott Desert Springs Resortin Palm Desert. ``We've seen an increase in reservations within atwo-week time period, and I think that's because it's been prettydarn cold around the country.''   Typical high temperatures last weekend were 12 in Detroit, 14 inIndianapolis, 44 in Miami Beach and 37 in Orlando, Fla.   It was 82 in Palm Springs, part of unseasonably warm weather inwhat forecasters say may be the driest December since 1876.   Since then, things have averaged out again, with temperatures inboth Florida and Southern California running in the 60s and 70s.But the earlier news of the big chill that extended into Floridahad its effect.   ``Some of the people coming from back East this year haveremarked they were coming here instead of Florida because theweather is better,'' said Ken Irwin at La Mancha Private Villas,where amenities such as private swimming pools and tennis courtscome at a price tag of up to $895 a night.   Overall, Southern California tourism has been slowing despite anincrease in foreign visitors, said Jack Kyser, chief economist forthe Greater Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.   Americans are traveling less because of fears of a weakereconomy, higher air fares ``and there is a lingering fear ofearthquakes,'' Kyser said.   But at the Universal Studios tour, where a fake quake is apopular ride, the flood of calls has been greater than usual thispost-Christmas season, said spokesman Jim Yeager.   ``The tour guide person says the last two to three days the linehas been ringing off the hook with people from the East Coast,''Yeager said.   ``We are getting a lot of calls coming in and the first questionasked is, `What is the weather?''' said Rolfe G. Arnhym, executivevice president of the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce.   All that interest could disappear, he points out, with just onecold snap or a few stories about desert storms.   ``We've had situations where the weather has done a 180 on usand our tourists have scampered off elsewhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
