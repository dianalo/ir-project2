But that's not thecase. They were opponents of the (Nazi) regime,'' said PeterSteinbach.   Steinbach, a Passau University historian, arranged an exhibitcalled ``Resistance to National Socialism'' that has generatedcontroversy.   The failed July 20, 1944 attempt by German generals to killHitler is included in the Berlin exhibit, as are the wartime callsfor anti-Nazi actions by a group of university students known asthe White Rose.   In both cases, those brave enough to oppose Hitler were torturedand executed.   But along with documents and photographs showing such widelyrecognized attempts to disrupt the Third Reich is a controversialdisplay about thousands of captured German soldiers in Sovietprisons who opposed the Third Reich and wanted the war to end.   Some members of the National Committee for a Free Germany didpropaganda work for the Soviets during the war, using loudspeakersat the front to urge German soldiers to quit fighting.   That part of the exhibit has angered Germans who do not believethe soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like Clausvon Stauffenberg, who was executed for planting the 1944 bomb meantto kill Hitler.   Hartmut von Hoesslin, brother of another German officer involvedin the 1944 plot, Maj. Roland von Hoesslin, was at the exhibit'sopening on Wednesday.   Hartmut von Hoesslin said the display on imprisoned Germansoldiers ``insulted all resistance-fighters.''   A protest letter presented by Hartmut von Hoesslin to theexhibit's organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiersamounted to ``psychoterror'' against fellow German troops.   But Steinbach said members of the National Committee for a FreeGermany deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they sawthemselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate Sovietcaptors, but as authentic opponents of Hitler's rule.   ``They felt they were representatives of the Allied cause tostop the war,'' Steinbach said.   The dispute has its roots in a long-standing German dilemma:what kind of honor to bestow on German soldiers who died during thewar, and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise.   German peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erectmonuments to World War II deserters, often angering people who feelit is an affront to those who died fighting.   There is heated controversy in Bockhorn, where citizens areembroiled in discussion over the community's memorial to soldierswho fell during both world wars.   An open letter from peace activists questioned whether everyfallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero.   The letter said, ``They (the fallen soldiers) had participatedin one of the greatest crimes of modern times,'' meaning thetragedies and terror begun by Nazi Germany when it started WorldWar II.   Kark Friedrich Schinkel, an officer in the West German navy,said in the respected newspaper Die Zeit that such disputesunderscore the difficulties some Germans still have in coming toterms with their homeland's Nazi past.   He said such controversies ``raise the question, 50 years afterthe German invasion of Poland, whether the concept of individualheroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder.''</TEXT></DOC>
