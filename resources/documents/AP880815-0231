However, Oqueli added, more ``political space has opened up''since the presidents of El Salvador and four other Central Americancountries signed a peace plan Aug. 7, 1987.   ``We want to take maximum advantage of that political opening,even though we are certain that doing political work in thosespaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles,'' he said inan interview in his party's San Salvador headquarters.   The regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in ElSalvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, but it has contributed tobroadening the range of political expression in El Salvador andNicaragua.   The National Revolutionary Movement, as part of the DemocraticRevolutionary Front, has been allied since 1981 with the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla organization knownas the FMLN that has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadorangovernment for eight years.   Leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980sbecause of rampant rightist death squads began returning to ElSalvador in November and are still coming.   Among them are Guillermo Ungo, Oqueli and Ruben Zamora, generalsecretary of the Popular Social Christian Movement.   Zamora's party is a left-leaning offshoot of the centristChristian Democratic Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whosat on military-civilian juntas in 1980-82 and has governed since1984. Duarte has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal.   The Oqueli's Revolutionay Movement, the Social Christians andthe Social Democratic Party have formed the Democratic Convergence.Oqueli's group announced in July its participation, via theConvergence, in the presidential election set for March. Althoughthe electoral front has yet to announce its participationofficially, it is already hard at work launching a campaign.   Zamora, in an interview with The Associated Press, said theConvergence's activity ``is generating a political alternativecapable of attracting ample sectors of the population that havebeen left without alternative.''   ``We're also contributing little by little to overcomingpeople's fear, because of past repression, of participating inpolitics,'' he said.   The leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory.   ``We are not taking part strictly for the votes, rather we'remounting a historical project that transcends election day,'' saidOqueli.   The main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end tothe war. The government has rejected two such proposals by theinsurgents so far this year.   ``The country's principal problem is the war,'' Oqueli said.``If the armed conflict is not resolved, we will not be able toresolve the economic, social and political problems _ health,housing, nutrition, employment. So we're telling the Salvadoranpeople that a solution to the war is necessary, and for us thatsolution is a negotiated political one.''   Duarte's position is that the guerrillas lay down their armsbefore talks can begin, but the rebels say that would be tantamountto surrender.   The guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban duringlegislative and municipal elections in March to underscore theircharacterization of them as ``a farce.'' The prospect of watchingtheir political allies take part in similar elections next year isthought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow.   ``The FMLN doesn't have to either approve or disapprove of ourparticipation,'' said Oqueli. ``They simply must respect it, as werespect their principal means of struggle.''   He said political and military revolutionary leaders met inManagua, Nicaragua, in mid-July to discuss electoral participation.   ``Our position and our objectives were fully understood (by theguerrillas.)'' he said.   The Convergence will go up against an incumbent party shatteredby infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power duringyears of crisis. Duarte's promises of peace and increasedwell-being have gone unfulfilled.   The Republican Nationalist Alliance, the main rightistopposition, is running on the full head of steam produced by itsvictories in March. The party, known as Arena, gained control ofthe legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide.   The leftist political front could face its most difficultdilemma if no candidate in March receives more than 50 percent ofthe vote. That would require a second round with the top twofinishers in the running.   Most observers doubt either the Christian Democrats or Arenawill receive a majority in the first round.   If the Convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote, whichis considered feasible, it could decide the outcome by casting itslot with one of the two major parties.   Oqueli said he believes abstention would be advisable in asecond round.   ``If we tie ourselves to the Christian Democrats, and theycontinue as they have been, we dirty our future,'' he said. ``AndArena represents the oligarchic past that brought the country towhere it is now.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Aug. 24</NOTE></DOC>
