Investigative activities of various agencieswere summarized and assessed. Agricultural waste water not intended forhuman use showed elevated selenium concentrations of up to 1400 ppb.Levels of selenium in fish (up to 96 ppm, wet weight), aquatic birds(up to 130 ppm in liver, dry weight), and waterfowl (up to 5.3 ppm flesh,wet weight) were unsafe for unrestricted human consumption. Data on seleniumin drinking water (less than 10 ppb), animals (mean values: beef liver0.3-0.35 ppm, wet weight; milk, 0.01-0.02 ppm), and air (particulate,14.8 ng/m3; gaseous, less than 1080 ng/m3) did not suggest a high levelof exposure. Selenium concentrations in soil were highly variable andsuggested a potential source of high exposure. Selenium values in bloodand urine of workers were within normal range. A community health surveydid not show any trend of adverse health effects in the local population.</TEXT></DOC>
