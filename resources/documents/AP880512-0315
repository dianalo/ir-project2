The Commerce Department said consumers spent a seasonallyadjusted $131.6 billion at retail stores last month, a drop of $815million from the revised March figure.   Sales had not fallen since a 0.8 percent setback last October,but economists said they were not particularly concerned by theweakness, especially since sales in March were revised upward toshow an increase of 1.7 percent. That was the fastest sales advancesince last August and almost twice the originally estiated 0.8percent gain for the month.   Both the big jump in March sales and the April decline wereblamed on the fact that Easter occurred on April 3 this year,meaning that consumers did their spring shopping in March,siphoning off sales that would normally have occurred last month.   ``The April retail sales figure is very misleading because ofEaster. Consumer spending is still holding up well,'' said AllenSinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   Analysts said other factors that played a role in the Aprildecline were unseasonably cold weather in some parts of the countrythat discouraged sales of such items as garden equipment and highertax bills some Americans faced at filing time this year.   They noted in particular that sales at restaurants were down 1.6percent, while sales at furniture stores were off 0.2 percent.   ``Some people did get shocked by the new tax law. They may havefilled out their tax forms and decided they couldn't afford to eatout for the rest of the month,'' said David Wyss, an economist withData Resources Inc.   Tom Megan, an economist with Evans Economics, a Washingtonforecasting firm, said he was not concerned by the April sales dipbecause with unemployment now at a 14-year low of 5.4 percent,consumers are confident about the future.   ``With employment and incomes still growing, we expect consumerswill keep spending,'' he said.   Total economic activity, as measured by the gross nationalproduct, rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first threemonths of the year, far better than the recession some people werepredicting immediately after the October stock market collapse.   However, the surprisingly strong growth has raised inflationconcerns. Many economists believe the Federal Reserve Board hasmoved in recent days to tighten up on interest rates as a way todampen demand and keep inflation under control.   Major banks on Wednesday boosted their prime lending rateone-half percentage point to 9 percent, reflecting the tightercredit conditions.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the weakreport on retail sales ``may serve to dampen inflationaryexpectations.''   The April retail sales report showed that car sales declined 1percent during the month, the first drop since last November.Analysts said this reflected the phaseout of various salesincentive programs that had lured consumers into showrooms inearlier months.   Without the weakness in car sales, total retail sales would havebeen a slightly lower 0.5 percent in April.   Sales at hardware and building supply stores were up 1 percent.Analysts attributing some of this strength to a boom in homeremodeling as more homeowners choose to renovate rather than moveto bigger houses.   Sales of non-durable goods dropped 0.6 percent overall. Withinthe category, sales at department stores dropped 0.5 percent,erasing part of the 2.1 percent jump in March. Both months wereinfluenced by the early Easter.   Sales at grocery stores fell 0.3 percent in April, while salesat gasoline stations were off 1.3 percent and sales at restaurantsdropped 1.6 percent.   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last at leastthree years, dropped 0.6 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
