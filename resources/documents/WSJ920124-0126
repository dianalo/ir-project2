The industry and itsregulators apparently believe that mergers -- like August'ssplicing of Bank of America and Security Pacific, ChemicalBank and Manufacturer's Hanover, and NCNB and Candamp;S/Sovran --are the answer. That's wrong: Mergers are not the solution tobank overcapacity.   Too many banking assets are chasing too few good loanopportunities. Under competitive pressure from other sorts ofinstitutions, the banks' share of short-term non-financialdebt has declined from more than 80% in the mid-1970s to lessthan 60% now. But since banks have federal deposit insurance,depositors continue to provide them with money to invest. Arough calculation shows that the banking industry, with totalassets of $3 trillion, is 15% too large.</LP><TEXT>   Banks have responded to the over-capacity by shiftingtheir business from corporate loans to off-balance sheetactivity, such as loan commitments and standby letters ofcredit for corporations, and to commercial real estatelending. But these risky new activities have not been enoughto replace lost bank profit. One measure of bank profit,return on assets, declined almost continually during the1980s, at the same time as one measure of risk, the ratio ofcharge-offs to total loans, rose continuously. In recentlyconducted research banking economist Richard Rosen and Ifound that the risk-return trade-off for banks worsenedthroughout the 1980s. During this period banks systematicallytook on more risk, holding (expected) return constant. Theproblem was not that banks wouldn't lend; it was that theyconsistently made bad bets on borrowers.   In unregulated industries, the natural impulse whenprofitability declines is to leave the industry for greenerpastures. One reason why banks are not shrinking in the faceof declining profitability is that &quot;blockaded exit&quot; preventsshrinkage. Unlike companies in other declining industries,banks cannot diversify into unrelated activities, as, forinstance, U.S. Steel did when it purchased Marathon Oil. Moreimportantly, nonbanks are restricted from buying banks.   Many commentators have argued that bank mergers willslowly shift resources out of the banking industry. Ourresearch, however, found that mergers do not result in areduction in excess capacity.   For example, when Candamp;S merged with Landmark bank in Floridain 1985, total assets of the new combined bank in the twoyears following the merger grew one to two percentage pointsfaster than the growth rate for the two banks in the fewyears prior to the merger. When First Union merged withAtlantic Bancorporation in 1985, the growth rate of totalassets was roughly double that of the two banks prior to themerger. While there are counter-examples, in general thealleged economies motivating the merger do not seem to resultin a reduction in total assets. Mergers appear to bemotivated by factors other than asset reduction.   The evidence that mergers are not shrinking the industrysuggests that some   hing in addition to blockaded exit is impeding thereduction of the industry. One important problem is thatmanagers like bigness; evidence suggests that managementcompensation is related to size. Also, manager-controlledcompanies resist shrinking or going out of business becausemanagers' careers are tied up in the firms they manage. Ifmanagers pursue their own goals rather than those ofstockholders, banks may continue growing even when the growthresults in reduced profitability.   Corporate control problems may be more severe in bankingthan in other industries. Because bank loans are typicallyilliquid, they are difficult for outsiders to value. Thismeans that it is hard for outsiders to detect situations inwhich bank managements are inefficiently using bankresources. Another reason for corporate control problems atbanks is that bank managers have regulatory protectionagainst takeovers unavailable to most of their nonbankbrethren.   There is an alternative explanation for banks' reluctanceto shrink, despite the declining profitability of theirindustry: The perverse incentives that arise from federaldeposit insurance. The federal government charges all banks,the safest and the riskiest alike, the same deposit insurancepremiums. That can encourage inefficient risk taking because,as real profit opportunities disappear, shareholders might(tacitly) encourage bank managers to &quot;go for broke&quot; byincreasing risk, since increased asset risk does not affectthe deposit insurance premium. There are those who believethis phenomenon -- often referred to as the &quot;moral hazard&quot;problem -- is responsible for many of the problems in bankingtoday. However, for this explanation to be true, shareholdersmust have effective control over bank managers, sinceincreased risk implies an increased chance of bankruptcy andtherefore of managers losing their jobs.   Which factor is more important in explaining thepersistence of overcapacity in the banking industry: theentrenchment of managements by rules that block exit andentry out of and into banking, or risk-taking caused byartificially priced deposit insurance? Our research suggeststhat entrenched management is more of a problem than is thedeposit insurance system.   In an unregulated industry with overcapacity there are avarsity of mechanisms which force resources to exit and findmore productive uses. In banking, entrenched managementleaves failure as the only way assets can be taken from theindustry. Until active nonbank investors are allowed into theindustry, bank failures will be the inevitable consequence ofthe banks' declining profitability.   ---   Mr. Gorton teaches finance at the Wharton business school.</TEXT></DOC>
