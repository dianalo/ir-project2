So, Manhattan Toy, with $5 million in annual sales, has sued the $1 billion Gerber Products Co., alleging Gerber has infringed Manhattan Toy's copyrights. After his company began selling its dinosaurs in 1984 through retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale's and F.A.O. Schwarz, Mr. Goldwyn says, Gerber launched a line of inexpensive imitations. The Gerber dinosaurs &quot;are virtually identical to&quot; Manhattan Toy's dinosaurs, according to the suit, filed last month in New York federal court. The suit seeks a court order to bar the Fremont, Mich.-based Gerber from selling the toys.    Manhattan Toy's suit reflects a growing aggressiveness among small companies in defending their rights to &quot;intellectual property&quot; -- copyrights, trademarks and patents -- against infringements by larger corporations.    Last week, for example, a small Emeryville, Calif., company called Plumsters Ltd. reached a settlement with Japan's Sanrio Co. and its U.S. subsidiary in which Sanrio agreed to stop using Plumsters' T-shirt and accessories patterns, which coincidentally feature dinosaur designs.    LAST MONTH, the closely held American Natural Beverage Corp. of New York got Anheuser-Busch Cos. of St. Louis to change the logo on its Zeltzer Seltzer soft drink, which American Natural claimed was &quot;confusingly similar&quot; to packaging for its Soho Natural Soda. And last November, Blue Mountain Arts Inc. of Boulder, Colo., won an injunction barring Hallmark Cards Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., from distributing a line of greeting cards Blue Mountain alleged were copied from its designs.    &quot;The climate in the U.S. for the protection of intellectual property has improved substantially in the last five years,&quot; says Melvin F. Jager, a Chicago attorney who chairs the American Bar Association's intellectual property litigation committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, created in 1982, has &quot;brought uniformity to the appeals process&quot; in patent cases, he says, while recent decisions by other courts have strengthened copyright and trademark laws. Also, more intellectual-property cases are being tried by juries, which tend to return larger damage awards.    As a result, Mr. Jager says, &quot;a small business can look at a situation and say, 'Not only is the climate more favorable for me to take on a big infringer, but the chances for a higher return are greater than they used to be.'&quot;    In its suit, Manhattan Toy doesn't ask for specific damages, only an amount equal to the profits Gerber has made on its dinosaur line. The New York company's attorney, Norman H. Zivin, says Manhattan Toy and Gerber have discussed a settlement &quot;in six figures.&quot; An attorney for Gerber confirms settlement talks are taking place but declines to discuss the possible terms.    Mr. Goldwyn, the toy maker's president, says the principle is as important as any payment. He says that &quot;the big companies take the following attitude: 'We have the money. These little companies don't have the resources to fight us.' Unfortunately, they're right. This time, though, the puppy dog they kicked, bites.&quot;    ---   Fund Established to Fill Financing Gap    Add another innovation to the list of financing alternatives created in response to federal caps on issues of industrial development bonds. American Development Finance Inc. of Washington, D.C., and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. of New York have created a $100 million pool of capital to finance small-business projects around the country.    The pool, called the Enterprise Capital Fund, can lend directly to small businesses. Or, the fund can purchase taxable bonds issued by state and local development agencies, which would relend the money to small borrowers.    The loans must be a minimum of $700,000, carry a repayment guarantee and be at least 55% secured by a mortgage on the project being financed. ADF estimates interest on the floating-rate loans will be one-half to one point over the prime rate, now at 8 1/4%.    The fund is intended to help fill the gap created by last year's tax overhaul, which sharply limited the amount of tax-exempt IDBs states can issue and the kinds of projects they can finance. For example, the fund will lend to real-estate projects, which the tax bill barred from tax-exempt financing.    ---   MANAGER'S MEMOS: President Reagan and several presidential aspirants will address the June 21-23 quadrennial small business conference of the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C. . . .
