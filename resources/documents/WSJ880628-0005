To Gary Burger, it was a sign he has seen more frequently of late. &quot;The last couple of weeks, (airline delays) have gotten worse,&quot; the executive from Somerset, N.J., says as he waits for the flight. &quot;With everyone I talk to it's the same.&quot;    The season for air-travel delays is upon us. New airline flight schedules this summer (the peak season runs from July 1 through Labor Day) are supposed to bring travelers some relief from the frustrations of past years. But a convincing case can be made that this summer will be a miserable one.    The main reason is a simple one: This summer should be a record-breaker in terms of traffic. The cheap dollar not only has encouraged Americans to travel at home rather than abroad, but has sent Europeans and Japanese scrambling for flights to the U.S. Already, Delta Air Lines' daily flights between Tokyo and Portland are nearly booked through September.    As a result, the number of passengers this summer is expected to increase by at least 5% over last year. That means 100,000 more passengers and 500 more flights a day. Without a comparable increase in the capacity of the nation's airports, it's difficult to see how beating last year's on-time performance won't require a lot of luck on the industry's part.    &quot;This is the crunch time,&quot; says Cornish F. Hitchcock, legal director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Ralph Nader group. He warns that airlines' failure to improve on their record of recent summers will increase the chances for approval of stalled consumer protection legislation in Congress.    Still, even the industry's critics concede that some progress has been made since last summer. There are nearly 1,000 more air-traffic controllers than a year ago, and new computer software will help them follow the use of airspace throughout the country.    Airlines, stung by criticism and scrambling to gain marketing advantages over rivals, are paying more attention to on-time performance. For two hours every Friday, officials at American Airlines gather in a small conference room and review computer printouts of problem flights. &quot;We tear every flight apart,&quot; says Don Kneram, managing director of system operations control at American.    Prodded by the government, airlines have reduced the bunching of flights at key airports, though the Federal Aviation Administration says they could do better. Airlines are also trying to get people onto planes faster. Delta starts boarding passengers as much as 30 minutes before the scheduled departure, allowing twice as much time as in the past. Another plus is that the worst aftershocks of troubled airline mergers may be easing, as indicated by a sharp drop in complaints by passengers at Northwest Airlines, which had a hard time meshing its operations with those of Republic Airlines, acquired in 1986.    &quot;I think that barring any unusual weather situation, (passengers) are going to be much more satisfied than they were last year,&quot; concludes Bob Coggin, assistant vice president for marketing development at Delta.    Perhaps, but there's a lot of reason to doubt that. For one thing, much of the improvement is illusory, based on the new math of airline scheduling: If a flight is routinely late, just add time to the schedule. As a result, passengers will find themselves waiting at gates, circling in the air and then waiting again for a gate to open -- and may still arrive &quot;on time.&quot;    Even Gabriel Phillips, executive vice president of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, acknowledges that &quot;some of what we have are delays now masquerading as revised schedules.&quot;    Adding more than 200 hours to its daily schedule between November and April helped Delta finally beat American Airlines in the Department of Transportation's monthly rankings for on-time performance. &quot;All the flying time we've added in increments finally produced the results we've been looking for,&quot; boasts Mr. Coggin, who oversees scheduling at Delta. American's response? &quot;One option is to add time to flights,&quot; acknowledges Mr. Kneram of American.    Delta Flight 943 from Cincinnati to Jackson, Miss., is an example of a flight &quot;fixed&quot; by schedule changes. The flight became an embarrassment to the airline with four consecutive appearances late last year on the government's list of chronically late flights -- those tardy at least 80% of the time. Now, it's arriving 15 or more minutes behind schedule less than 10% of the time, thanks to an extra 20 minutes in its scheduled flight time.    Another problem with the predictions for a smoother summer is that they are based in part on a decline in air-traffic control delays so far this year. The FAA defines these as delays of 15 minutes or more caused by system problems such as bad weather or heavy traffic. There were 887 such delays a day through May, down 6% from the same period last year, according to the Air Transport Association.    But much of the improvement in delays stems from the fact that the weather this year has been unusually good -- a condition that may not continue. In a season when thunderstorms in one region can back up traffic across the country, it wouldn't take much to turn this year's average higher. Also, a 6% reduction from last year, which was a horrendous year for delays, still leaves pretty miserable service.    Another problem: A runway at O'Hare, the busiest airport, is closed for resurfacing and lengthening this summer. Depending on wind direction, that can eliminate the use of one of three arrival runways.    Still, some industry executives and observers wonder whether any improvement in delays would even be noticed, what with the litany of complaints about lost luggage, long lines and crowded planes.    Any improvement in delays &quot;will be imperceptible,&quot; says Daniel T. Smith, director of consumer and industry affairs for the International Airline Passengers Association. &quot;Within the total experience of traveling, it's still a hassle.&quot;    Indeed, passengers responding to a survey by Travel-Holiday magazine didn't seem to notice much improvement last year, despite the fact that the average number of delays fell to 975 a day from 1,144 in 1986. (One reason may be that while delays fell, they were still, by historical measure, very high; delays averaged about 500 a day in 1977.) Evaluating carriers for on-time performance, courtesy, baggage handling and food, the magazine reports that nearly all domestic airlines showed a decline in each area. Only Alaska Airlines rated an honorable mention in the U.S., while three foreign carriers earned the highest marks: Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Swissair.    Little wonder that some airline executives seem resigned to bad reviews from passengers. &quot;I think we will have better service,&quot; says Stephen M. Wolf, chairman and chief executive of United Airlines. &quot;Do I think the public will give the airlines kudos? No.&quot;    And they aren't likely to for a long time. For no matter what happens this summer, problems with delays are destined to plague the airlines for many years. Airport operators say the number of airports with delays of more than 20,000 hours a year is expected to increase from 18 at present to 32 in eight years and more than 50 in 12 years.    The increase isn't inevitable. But to stop it, many things must be done. Weather, for instance, will continue to play havoc with schedules -- even though its effect could be reduced. The FAA says 69% of the air-traffic control delays last year were caused by the elements. But Richard H. Judy, director of Miami International Airport, notes that could be reduced if busy airports had a greater capability to handle traffic. Because delays at key airports have ripple effects throughout the country, added capacity in such places means &quot;we could deal much better with the weather,&quot; he says.    In Denver, for example, capacity can fall 50% in bad weather, partly because runways are too close to allow simultaneous takeoffs and landings under such conditions. The city's new airport would correct this with more space between runways, but it won't be in operation for at least five years.    Meanwhile, because stretching out schedules means leaving planes on the ground longer, there may not be much more room for that expensive -- and ultimately artificial -- fix. Already, the industry estimates air-traffic control delays cost it $2 billion a year and tie up the equivalent of 235 airplanes.    But the biggest hindrance to improvement is simply that more people will be flying, and that growth should easily outstrip efforts to boost airport and air-traffic capacity.    &quot;I have a sneaky suspicion that the level of progress will be spotty from here on out,&quot; says Mr. Smith of the passengers association. &quot;As passengers increase, you reach another plateau where it seems really lousy again unless the system and capacity are increased.&quot;    ---   What's a Delay?    It depends on whom you talk to.    Department of Transportation   --A delay occurs when a flight arrives 15 or more minutes after its scheduled time.    --The drawback: Airlines are cutting reported delays by adding time to their schedules. While this may make schedules appear more reliable, it doens't mean passengers will reach their destinations quicker. Also, delays due to mechanical probelems aren't counted; the department doesn't want carriers to compromise safety to boost on-time performance.    Federal Aviation Administration   --The FAA tracks air traffic control delays -- those of 15 minutes or more caused by problems in the air traffic system, such as bad weather or congestion.    --The drawback: It doesn't count delays caused by the airline. Is the crew late? Baggage mixed up? Gate or plane unavailable? These holdups wouldn't be included.

The recent display of flights comes from the electronic edition of the Official Airline Guide. It shows how travelers can weigh on-time performance along with other variables. Though they rarely volunteer it, travel agents and airline-reservations clerks have this information at their fingertips.    The column at the far right shows the on-time peformance as reported by the airlines (in this case USAir and Eastern). A '9' would indicate a flight that arrives within 15 minutes of schedule more than 90% of the time, an '8' is a flight that's on time 80-89% of the time and so on.
