Gorbachev's warning about anarchy and ethnic separatism bycalling for a crackdown on groups seeking more freedom from Moscow,reports said today.   But leaders of Lithuania and Georgia, two republics where ethnicissues are causing the Kremlin headaches, blamed their problems onprocesses taking place nationwide or on outside provocation intendedto cause a crackdown.   Absamat Masaliev, Communist Party chief of the Central Asianrepublic of Kirghizia, told a meeting of the party's policy-makingCentral Committee that the ``time has come ... to bring to orderthose who openly speak out against our structure, our unity,sabotage perestroika and abuse democracy.''   Masaliev said that calls to turn the party into a union ofindependent groups, or to introduce a multiparty system, were ``anextremely dangerous and destructive tendency.''   His comments and those of other party leaders were made Tuesdayand distributed today by Tass, the official Soviet news agency. TheCentral Committee continued its work today, and Tass said it debateda blueprint for ethnic relations offered by Gorbachev as part of hisreform drive.   The president opened the meeting Tuesday by offering the 15Soviet republics more power to decide economic issues. But he saidthe Kremlin would not tolerate anarchy or what he called separatistdemagogues. Ethnic disputes have become one of the most complex andserious problems in this land of more than 100 nationalities duringthe period of Gorbachev's reforms.   They have resulted in more than 200 deaths in the past 18 months,the virtual blockade of one republic and calls for independence fromMoscow.   In April, 20 people were killed by soldiers during a nationalistprotest in Georgia, and activists said the violent crackdown wasordered by Moscow.   The Georgian Communist Party chief, Givi Gumbaridze, claimedtoday that ``excesses on nationalist grounds often are orchestratedby outsiders, forcing authorities to impose curfews and specialforms of administration.''   He did not identify the outsiders.   Gorbachev urged Soviets ``not give in to demagogues'' withslogans ``served under the pleasant sauce of independence,secession, etc.''   He recounted how the Kremlin has tried to bring peace to theCaucasus Mountain republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, where Sovietofficials say the current situation is more tense than at any timeduring an 18-month standoff over control of the Nagorno-Karabakhregion.   The Kremlin has imposed direct rule on the region to no avail,and Gorbachev said the party was contemplating ``resolute measures''to quell the violence.   Addressing demands in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to recognizethat they were forcibly absorbed by dictator Josef Stalin as WorldWar II broke out, Gorbachev said Stalin's policy was wrong but thatthe Baltic republics joined the Soviet Union voluntarily rather thanface Adolf Hitler's Nazi forces alone.   Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party chief, said today thatLithuania does not intend to try to leave the Soviet Union. But hedefended his republic by saying the transformation taking place inthe entire country under Gorbachev's reforms is simply moving aheadfaster in Lithuania.   Yuri Yelchenko, a secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party,said a ``series of independent formations have clear anti-socialistplatforms, the basis of which often lies in bourgeois nationalism.''   He said such groups were especially active in the westernUkraine, and he accused the Narodni Rukh grass-roots politicalmovement of seeking to seize power from the Communists.   Local party leaders said they support plans to give them morecontrol over their economies. They complained that since many of thefactories and offices in their republics now are under the controlof national ministries in Moscow, they pay little in the way oflocal taxes.   In its first decision Tuesday, the Central Committee backedGorbachev's proposal to hold the next party congress ahead ofschedule, in October 1990. The sessions are held every five yearsand the last one opened on Feb. 24, 1986.   A congress gives Gorbachev the broadest possible opportunity toremake the party leadership. It is theoretically the most powerfulparty body, responsible for broad policy outlinesa as well aselecting the Central Committee. Since the 1986 congress, Gorbachevhas been able to demote committee members or promote others, andonly such a session can give him an entirely new Central Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
