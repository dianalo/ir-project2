Close to the transitiontemperature T/sub c/ magnetic flux moves easily and reversibly in thesematerials so that magnetization is a thermodynamically reversible variable.Hence, the free-energy surfaces can be measured and quantities such asentropy and specific heat can be derived. Magnetization is found to belinear in (T/sub c/-T){sup 2} near T/sub c/. The free-energy surfaceshows substantial changes with magnetic field all the way up to 92 K,well outside the usual H/sub c/{sub 2}K vs T plots derived from resistivityor ac susceptibility data.</TEXT></DOC>
