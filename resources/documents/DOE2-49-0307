The ground-basedtransmitter and receiver may be located beneath the disturbance or outsideits projection on the ground. Amplitudes and phases of the laterallydependent part of all transverse magnetic (TM) field components are calculatedas a function of range for a given location of the disturbance or asa function of disturbance location for a fixed range. Although partialsum-convergence difficulties limit its general utility, the resultingprogram can be used for a variety of case studies. Examples given includedrifting sporadic-E patches, a nuclear depression, and a weak solar-protonevent.</TEXT></DOC>
