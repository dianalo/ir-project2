The fund, Nuveen Municipal Value Fund Inc., is being co-managed by Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. and John Nuveen andamp; Co. It's being sold through a syndicate of about 100 underwriters, according to a Nuveen spokeswoman. The fund will likely begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange this week, Nuveen added.    The Nuveen fund is another sign of the boom in closed-end funds during the past year. These funds, which invest like mutual funds, have a fixed number of shares and are publicly quoted. Giant closed-end offerings in 1987 have included the $1.2 billion Duff andamp; Phelps Selected Utilities fund, and the $1.1 billion MFS Multimarket Income Trust.    With investment-grade municipal bonds averaging an 8% yield, traders and brokers said they expect the Nuveen fund to find considerable retail appeal. Traders also said that as the Nuveen fund snaps up municipal bonds to fill its portfolio, it could bolster overall price levels in the tax-exempt market.    But Thomas Herzfeld, publisher of a closed-end fund newsletter, said buying shares in a closed-end fund at the initial offering &quot;is the worst time to buy them.&quot;    &quot;Closed-end funds are normally priced at a premium to their net-asset value,&quot; at the initial offering, reflecting underwriting costs, he said. Nuveen declined to comment on underwriting fees, but fees of other closed-end funds have ranged from 6% to 8% of the offering price. At those levels, underwriters would stand to earn fees totaling roughly $100 million on the Nuveen fund.    Nuveen, based in Chicago, is a modest-sized firm, with $186 million in capital, specializing in municipal bond investments. But practically every major Wall Street firm is pitching in on the underwriting.    The Nuveen fund is expected to trade at $10 a share. In its prospectus, the fund reserves wide latitude to invest more than 25% of assets in single-family mortgage revenue bonds, health-facility bonds, industrial revenue bonds or water and sewer bonds. Nuveen says at least 80% of its portfolio will be investment-grade bonds. The fund reserves the right to use futures and options.    Some bond traders said Nuveen may be hard-pressed to get bargains in municipal bonds. With market participants aware that the fund will pour $1.5 billion into the market in coming weeks, there's already some upward pressure on bond prices, they explained.    The Nuveen fund greatly eclipses two other closed-end municipal bond funds traded on the Big Board. The $310 million MFS Municipal Income Trust, which was sold at $10 a share in November 1986, currently trades at $9.75. The $260 million Colonial Municipal Income Trust, offered for sale last March at $10 a share, closed yesterday at $8.875 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
