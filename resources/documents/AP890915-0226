(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The lawn and garden industry has to benimble to deal with fickle weather _ drought last year wiltednational sales 11 percent to $15.5 billion _ but retailers arepoised for fast growth in the 1990s, experts say.   In trend-setting California, lawn and garden sales grew 9 percentto $3.8 billion in 1988, and part of the reason was a switch byhomeowners to plants and irrigation systems that use less water.   ``Weather is the primary factor that affects this industry andit's something the industry has no control over,'' said Charles W.Dunn, founder of the Garden Center Institute in Atlanta, during avisit to the huge Pacific Horticultural Trade Show here.   ``Rain drenched the Southeast and East this summer and hurtsales. But there are some shifts occurring out there in themarketplace, and the future looks bright,'' Dunn said.   ``The Baby Boom generation,'' he said, ``is probably the bestsegment of the marketplace out there for gardening, and it's goingto drive this industry into the 1990s, along with the `50-50'generation _ people who are 50 years old and have a $50,000-plusannual income.''   As the Baby Boomers, approaching or just over 40, become moreestablished in homes, they are spending more money to spruce upgardens and lawns for both enjoyment and investment.   ``We did a nationwide study and found new homeowners felt that awell-landscaped home could add up to 15 percent of real estatevalue,'' Dunn said. ``It was as good or better investment asremodeling the kitchen or bath when it came time to sell that home.''   Limited garden space and a new influx of immigrants also arehaving an impact on garden suppliers. The nursery of the '90s islikely to sell more container plants, dwarf trees and fruit treespopular in Asia and the Middle East.   ``We're selling more dwarf citrus trees, which don't take up asmuch space and bear a `manageable' amount of fruit for today'ssmaller family,'' said Don Dillon Jr. of Four Winds Nursery inFremont.   Garden suppliers, Dunn said, report four types of landscapesincreasingly being installed at American homes:   _An area for public view that looks good but requires lowmaintenance.   _A grassy play area for children with less emphasis on flowers.   _An entertainment area with movable furniture.   _The garden retreat, where people can sit and read or just getaway from it all, integrating water, flowers, rocks, bridges andexotic furniture.   But no matter which landscape is selected, thought has to begiven to water use and cyclical bouts of heat and drought.   Gardening tips being distributed at many retail nurseries teachhomeowners how to conserve water and maintain landscapes throughproper design, grouping of plant material, correct planting methodsand mulching, as well as water-saving practices.   Among the products on display at the Pacific Horticultural TradeShow are several that save water: crystals that hold water like tinyreservoirs around the roots of plants, root sponges that reducewatering after transplanting, drip irrigation systems, and plantersthat have built-in reservoirs and moisture control sensors that turnthe watering function on and off as needed.</TEXT></DOC>
