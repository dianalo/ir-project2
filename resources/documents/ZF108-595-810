 Issues relating to the computer industry are somehow lostin the shuffle.andP;  Legislation regulating the computer industrycould be influenced by a few industry giants which have thewherewithal to lobby successfully, but corporations are not inagreement as to a standard policy regarding the industry.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     JudiciaryLobbyingComputer IndustryLegislationGovernment Regulation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>On the southern shore of the Mediterranean, in 3 B.C, Alexander the Greatfounded a city destined to become the greatest in the classical world, Underthe rule of the Ptolemies it dominated in science and literature, and itscelebrated library was the finest that had ever existed.andP;  Surviving evenconquest by Rome, it would ultimately be regarded as the intellectualbirthplace of Christianity.andP;  In 641 A.D., however, came an event that provedcatastrophic: the capture of Alexandria by the army of Amr, the great Arabgeneral.andP;  E.M.andP;  Forster wrote of the conquerors' impact on the city, &quot;.andP;  . andO;though they had no intention of destroying her, they destroyed her, as achild might a watch&quot;.andM;I have always been taken with Forster's metaphor, because it is such an aptillustration of the complexity and interdependence of civilization.andP;  If anyone of society's multiplicity of parts becomes incapable of functioning as itshould, the whole mechanism is likely to be affected.andP;  And when it comes tocomplexity and interdependence, even wondrous Alexandria wouldn't be a matchfor the society into which ours is evolving.andM;Which is why a column such as this from time to time has to touch on mattersthat at first glance might appear to have little to do with &quot;computer law&quot;,or even with the computing industry in general.andP;  We did this in Vol.andP;  7, No.andO;9, in discussing the potential impact of a pending proposal to split off partof the geographical area covered by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.andP;  Inoted then that such a development would in effect put the PacificNorthwest's computing-industry complex in an appellate jurisdiction separatefrom California-based Silicon Valley, leaving open the possibility that thetwo resulting courts might eventually make conflicting rulings on legalquestions of importance to the industry.andM;As was pointed out in this earlier column, the Supreme Court, which in theoryis supposed to step in to resolve such  Splits in the Circuits&quot;, doesn'talways do so.andP;  Since Congress has thus far failed to provide Comprehensivelegislation laying down rules to regulate the computing field, the industryhas had to depend almost entirely upon this second tier of federal appellatetribunals for guidance as to what the law does-and does not-dictate.andO;Therefore, nothing that would have the effect of injecting further complexityinto the appellate system could be regarded as helpful for the computingcommunity.andM;But the impact of a circuit-court split is negligible when you consider howthe computing community is likely to be affected by developments currentlytaking place in what would seem to be separate areas of our complex andinterdependent society.andP;  Here we must shift our focus from the appellatelevel of the judicial system down to the trenches, so to speak.andP;  Becauselegal questions ordinarily can't even be considered by an appellate courtuntil they've first been acted upon by a trial court, any blockage in thatpart of the judicial plumbing inevitably results in a stoppage in theappellate portion also.andM;Unfortunately, our trial-level courts are in danger of becoming swamped.andP;  Thedemands placed on these tribunals have been increasing steadily for severalyears, and lengthy delays in bringing cases to trial have become commonplace.andO;To this already less-than-desirable situation add the effects of two ongoingdevelopments, either of which in itself has the potential to precipitate avirtual collapse of the system.andM;It's hardly news that the decade just past will go down in history as beingnotorious for the number and magnitude of scandals involving the finance andbanking arenas.andP;  The once-arcane term  junk bond&quot; appears fated to become apermanent part of the language, while &quot;savings and loan&quot; is already such atainted phrase that even institutions still retaining a semblance of solvencyare falling over themselves to adopt some other name.andP;  The financialshenanigans of the 1980s have managed to make the Credit Mobilier and TeapotDome scandals that tarnished the administrations of Presidents Ulysses S.andO;Grant and Warren G. Harding look like rather small potatoes.andM;The federal government currently estimates that the cost to cover losses inthe savings and loan industry alone will exceed $325 billion, and there arethose who expect that this figure will turn out to be far too low.andP;  Sincetaxpayers will be stuck with paying the bulk of this tab, it's understandablethat a clamor for blood has arisen from the populace.andM;This is why US Attorneys from Texas painted a bleak picture in testimony theyrecently gave to Congress.andP;  More than a third of the cases of alleged S andamp; Lfraud now under investigation are centered in that state, prompting theprosecutor for the Northern District of Texas to lament, &quot;We can pour moreand more cases into the mouth of the funnel, but every single case must passthrough the narrow neck of the judiciary.&quot;andM;As the New York Times reports, it was the prosecutors' conclusion thatCongress must provide &quot;more Federal judges, courtrooms and prosecutors&quot; inorder to expedite prosecutions.andP;  And exactly how many more trial courts areneeded? The US Attorney in Houston provided a clue by stating that even ifthe number of judges in his district were increased from the present 9 to 20,the court dockets would remain jammed.andM;As FBI Director William Sessions has observed, the problem is not limited toTexas.andP;  Florida, Colorado, Arizona, and California immediately come to mindas states that have each seen spectacular S andamp; L fiascos, and this list isnowhere near exhaustive.andP;  Nor is it only a question of providing more judges,courtrooms, and prosecutors in those states, as suggested by the testimony ofthe Texas US Attorneys.andM;Let's consider the figures given for Houston.andP;  In addition to the salaries ofeleven additional judges-which in itself would be no small matter, given thepresent budgetary climate-for each new judge there must be another courtreporter, at least one clerk, and one or more bailiffs.andP;  Besides chambers foreach judge, this means additional offices, as well as more courtrooms, andthat kind of space costs money.andP;  Once all this is in place, so that theadditional trials can actually commence, additional jurors still must be paidfees.andP;  Finally, while we might assume that the S andamp; L defendants will not needto be provided counsel at public expense, I wouldn't want to make book on it.andM;In short, we're talking a lot of bucks here.andP;  But the fallout from the 1980sfinancial scandals is only one of the developments that threatens tooverwhelm the federal court system.andP;  Now, let's look at the other.andM;These days it would be difficult to be unaware that the US government isescalating its 50-year-old policy banning the sale and use of drugs that havebeen designated as illicit  to the level of what it terms a &quot;war&quot;.andP;  The idea,apparently, is that by throwing more money-and the army, to boot-at theproblem, an effort that so far has been a dismal failure can be turned into asuccess.andP;  Even so, I was startled to hear the vow-from the highest level ofgovernment-that there would  be no plea bargaining in the prosecutions thatwere to take place under the administration's draconian criminal statutes.andM;Now, I have no idea whether this was intended to be taken literally--another&quot;read my lips&quot; pronouncement, as it were-but as someone who's spent more timethan I care to think about practicing in the criminal-law milieu, I can saythat there would be no more effective way of bringing the judicial system toa status of complete gridlock.andP;  For this very reason, I don' know anyonewho's actual the trenches-at either the prosecution or the defense end of thecounsel table-who could regard such a promise seriously.andM;Lest I be accused of partisanship here, let me hasten to say that the firsttime I recall hearing a &quot;no plea bargaining&quot; pledge from a candidate for highpublic office, it was from the mouth of a Democrat.andP;  Regretfully, since thatoccasion I've heard it with increasing frequency, because it's undeniably acrowd-pleaser.andM;The term &quot;plea bargain&quot; covers a lot of territory.andP;  True, sometimes it meansa reduction in charge, but often the quid pro quo for a guilty plea amountsto nothing more sinister than an agreement that the defendant will be allowedto remain temporarily in the local lockup, so that his ailing mother willhave a chance to come visit him, before he's whisked off behind the cold greywalls of a maximum-security prison.andP;  It's simply unrealistic to think thatguilty pleas would be forthcoming in any significant percentage of caseswithout it.andP;  and without guilty pleas, the criminal justice system would cometo a standstill.andM;In case there are readers who might think that all this has nothing to dowith the civil lawsuits that concern the computing community, consider thatunder the Constitution, criminal cases are given precedence over civil cases.andO;This means that if criminal prosecutions jam up the courts, no civil matterscan be heard.andM;Okay, suppose we forget that silliness about no plea bargaining.andP;  Withstepped-up enforcement there will still be a plethora of drug-related casesburdening the court system.andP;  These won't consist solely of directprosecutions for dealing or possessing drugs.andP;  There'll also be complexproceedings against money launderers-which could involve major financialinstitutions-and for such things as recovery of drug proceeds or forfeitureof drug-related property.andM;This potential for inundation of the trial courts formed the other part ofthe basis for the Houston prosecutor's plea for more federal trial judges inhis district.andP;  As he advised the Congressional committee, the Houstondistrict, which encompasses much of Texas' border with Mexico, has &quot;a bigbacklog&quot; of unresolved drug-trafficing cases.andP;  But things will be just as badin other border states, as they will, in fact, in any area-such as NewYork-that serves as an important gateway into the US.andM;And what are the chances that this huge increase in judicial personnel willactually be realized? Don't ask me: that's a political issue.andP;  All I can sayis that if the dismal scenario I've outlined here should come to pass, thecomputing community will only be left with one realistic option-to prevailupon Congress to legislate the rules the industry must have if it's tocontinue its orderly development.andM;That, of course, means that the industry will have to shed its reluctance toinvolve itself in the rough-and-tumble of Congressional politics.andP;  An entryinto the political arena will entail decidedly un-New Age things such aslobbyists, PACs, direct campaign contributions, and buying tables at 1,000-a-plate dinners-not just for the local representative, but forpoliticians all over the country.andM;Distasteful as this may be to some, that's the way things get done inCongress.andP;  In deciding to play this game, however, participants incomputer-related activities will have to confront a serious difficulty: thepresent lack of consensus among the various sectors of the industry as towhat they want the rules governing all the aspects of computing to be.andM;Without such consensus, there's an ominous possibility that independentparticipants in the computing arena-individual software developers, let'ssay-should ponder.andP;  I'm referring to the eventual likelihood that majorplayers would elect to go it alone.andP;  Certainly there are companies in theindustry that have the financial resources to swing a great deal of weight inWashington if they choose, and the legislation that could result might not beat all to the liking of the independents.andM;Ah, the crystal ball is clouding over.andP;  I guess we'll just have to see howthings actually turn out.andP;  In the meantime, it would be wise to keep in mindthe old bromide about what happens to those who put their heads in the sand.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
