The sharp decline in annual earnings was caused by athird-quarter, $550 million pretax asset write-down forupgrading aging network facilities to digital equipment, andby other nonrecurring items during the year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We don't expect all gloom and doom but we expect to seeless growth this year than in previous times,&quot; said GeneGabbard, chief financial officer. Noting that the softeningeconomy already has weakened the traffic growth rates atother phone companies, he said, &quot;I don't see (economicproblems) disappearing quickly . . . Volume growth this yearwill be single-digit,&quot; in line with the industry's.   MCI's results show that fourth-quarter revenue was flatcompared with the third quarter, indicating that theWashington, D.C., company is having difficulty boosting itsshare of the long-distance market, and that, minus the recentacquisition of long-distance carrier Telecom USA Inc., MCI'score-business revenue growth has actually weakened.   For the quarter, revenue was slightly over $2 billionagainst $1.71 billion a year ago. But the latest quarter'srevenue was flat compared with the third quarter, whenresults included only a portion of Telecom's revenue. Netincome was $127 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with$108 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday MCI stocksurged $2.125, to $24.375.   For the year, revenue rose 19% to $7.68 billion from $6.47billion. Net fell to $299 million, or $1.06 a share, from$558 million, or $2.09 a share. MCI said 1990 earnings wouldhave been $630 million, or $2.48 a share, were it not for thethird-quarter write-down.   &quot;I'm wiping the sweat off my brow,&quot; said Gregory Sawers,an analyst at Sanford Bernstein andamp; Co. &quot;Two things they had todo right: Volume growth and sales, general and administrativeexpenses and I'm generally pleased with both.&quot;   He said analysts had expected a &quot;calamity at MCI&quot; afterrecent reports of slower growth from the recession at theregional Bell operating companies. Instead, MCI's trafficvolume grew 4% from the third to the fourth quarter, althoughmost of this came from adding Telecom.   Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., notedthat this traffic volume weakness, combined with MCI'sincreased expenses, show that 1991 will be &quot;very tough&quot; forthe industry.</TEXT></DOC>
