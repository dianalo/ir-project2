House leaders sought to force the Reagan administration to comply with certain provisions of an unratified SALT II treaty, and to ban tests of all but the smallest nuclear weapons. The Senate side refused to agree to the provisions, however, and the House eventually dropped the proposal in return for a Senate agreement for a vote on the treaty issue later this year.    The conference agreement Friday cleared the way for approval of the spending bill by Congress this week. The measure affects funding for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.    If passed by both houses and signed by the president, the measure primarily would increase current funding for the Commodity Credit Corp. by $5.55 billion. The credit corporation pays for farm subsidies.    The measure also would increase funding for federal workers' salaries, provide $355 million in aid to the homeless, and increase by $77 million funding for testing and education related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It would require AIDS testing for immigrants, applicants for permanent residency status, and illegal immigrants seeking amnesty under last year's sweeping immigration law.    The measure also funds the programs to carry out the immigration law, while modifying the procedures for one of the new law's cornerstones: sanctions against employers of illegal immigrants.    The law required the Immigration and Naturalization Service to begin serving citations to employers found in violation of the law, starting this past June 1. Although the agency said it wouldn't serve citations or take other enforcement action in June, the Senate had attached to the spending bill language delaying imposition of the sanctions for four months, until Oct. 1.    Under the compromise developed by the conference committee, language ordering the delay was omitted. But the measure would postpone until Sept. 1 a provision requiring employers to verify a new worker's eligibility within three days of hiring. The conference agreement also would require the INS to finish distributing educational materials related to the new law by Aug. 1.    A spokeman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), the chief advocate for the delay, said the compromise achieves much the same thing as the Senate's earlier language because &quot;it postpones the need to comply with verifications. Obviously you can't be hit with sanctions.&quot;    &quot;The basic concern was the informational job wasn't being achieved,&quot; said the aide. &quot;We didn't want people being subjected to criminal penalties when they hadn't even been given information.&quot;    Separately, the Senate voted 65-8 Saturday to approve legislation authorizing $443 million in aid to the homeless this year, including funds for emergency housing, nutrition, health care and job training. The House is scheduled to vote on a comparable measure soon. </TEXT></DOC>
