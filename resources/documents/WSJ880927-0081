The oil field services and chemical concern said it received a letter from the Justice Department saying that it is a target in the investigation, which is believed to be examining price fixing in the completion fluids and drilling muds businesses.    NL has said in several SEC filings that it received grand jury subpoenas in July and November 1987 asking for documents about the company's completion fluids sales and marketing. The company said the subpoenas cover the period from 1980 to November 1987.    NL spokesmen said other oil field services companies and oil companies also are being investigated by the grand juries, which are sitting in New Orleans and Houston. The company said it intends to vigorously defend itself against any formal charges if they are filed.    The company also said that the SEC is conducting a private investigation into trading in its stock and the stock of its parent company, Valhi Inc., dating back to 1986. The companies said they have responded to the commission's inquiries.    Dallas investor Harold Simmons acquired about 51% of NL's common stock in August 1986. He now owns about 52% of NL's common and two-thirds of its preferred through Valhi, his 86%-owned holding company.    (Revised WSJ Sept. 29, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
