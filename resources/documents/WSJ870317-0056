In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Seton shares rose $3, to $16.    Seton said the bid from Philip D. Kaltenbacher, chairman and chief executive officer, was subject to arranging necessary financing. Mr. Kaltenbacher owns about 30% of the company's 7,690,000 shares. At the tentative offering price, purchase of the remaining shares would cost about $85 million.    Members of management, other than Mr. Kaltenbacher, own about 7.5% of Seton's shares.    Seton tans and distributes leather, is a supplier to medical-products makers and produces chemicals and coatings. In 1986 it earned $7.9 million, or $1.04 a share, on $113 million in revenue.    The Seton chairman proposed to acquire the company in a leveraged buyout and intends to invite certain members of senior management to participate in the purchase. A leveraged buyout is financed by debt that is repaid from the sale of assets or cash generated from the acquired operations.    Neither Mr. Kaltenbacher nor other Seton officials could be reached for comment.    Seton's directors have appointed an independent committee of outside directors to consider the proposal and make a recommendation to the board, the company statement said. Seton also said it will postpone its annual meeting, which was scheduled for March 31, until it has made a decision about Mr. Kaltenbacher's proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
