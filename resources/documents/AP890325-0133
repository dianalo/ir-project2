The 6{-hour demonstration held in heavy rain was the largest ina series of protests designed to focus attention on the SupremeCourt's reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.   Some 300 officers on foot and horseback moved in on the morethan 800 anti-abortion activists who blocked the Family PlanningAssociates clinic. Most of those arrested were cited fortrespassing and released, but some were sent to jails on moreserious charges.   ``We look forward to the day that you have to arrest themurderers,'' Randall Terry, founder of the national OperationRescue anti-abortion group, shouted through a bullhorn before he,too, was carried away by police.   Pro-choice leaders mobilized hundreds of supporters incoordinated counter-demonstrations that helped nullify theprotesters' aim of shutting down women's health clinics throughoutSouthern California.   ``We are here today to celebrate the defeat of OperationPersecute,'' pro-choice leader Dady Blake told a gathering atPatriotic Hall at the end of the day.   Police slipped nylon handcuffs on the anti-abortion protesters,who fell limp to the ground and had to be dragged to waiting blueand white police buses. Pro-choice activists cheered as each buspulled away.   Most were arrested for investigation of trespassing, blockingentrances or interfering with police _ misdemeanor charges thatresult in a citation and quick release. The total number of arrestswas 725, said Capt. Sid Mills.   Mills said four _ including Terry _ were arrested forinvestigation of conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime,a felony.   Chief Daryl F. Gates said he would urge the city attorney to sueOperation Rescue for the $60,000 to $100,000 the police operationhad cost the city.   More than 900 people had already been arrested Thursday andFriday during protests elsewhere in southern California and inPhiladelphia, Alexandria, Va., Albany and Syracuse, N.Y., and othercities. Additional, smaller protests took place elsewhere aroundthe country Saturday.   Word had leaked out that the demonstration target would beFamily Planning Associates, in the mid-city area, and pro-choiceadvocates had surrounded the clinic when the protesters fromOperation Rescue arrived about 7 a.m.   ``It shows that they're certainly outnumbered in the public andin the opinion polls,'' said Kathy Spillar, an organizer of thepro-choice group.   Hundreds of riot-helmeted officers moved in on foot just before9 a.m. and police began ordering the demonstrators to clear a pathto the clinic door to comply with a federal court order.   A clinic receptionist said abortions scheduled for the day werecanceled when patients couldn't get in. She said patients werereferred to other offices of Family Planning Associates, whichoperates about 20 women's clinics in California.   The receptionist, who wouldn't give her name, said about halfthe clinic's business is performing abortions.   It was the third and final day of Operation Rescue's Holy Weekprotests. On each of the previous days they also were met by largecounter protests. Police in suburban Cypress made 373 arrestsThursday, but Long Beach police refused to arrest protestersFriday, saying the targeted clinic had already closed.   The latest day of protest began hours after three people werearrested at Melodyland Christian Center after smoke bombs went offin the auditorium where anti-abortion advocates have been meeting.The bombs caused a brief panic but no one was injured, police said.Those arrested remained in jail in lieu of $25,000 bail each.   There have been 1.5 million abortions annually in the UnitedStates since the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalizedabortion in all states.   Operation Rescue, based in Binghampton, N.Y., has stageddemonstrations nationwide, notably at the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta last summer. Arrests of its members since1987 total more than 21,000.</TEXT></DOC>
