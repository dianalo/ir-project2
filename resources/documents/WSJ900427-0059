It is the latest example of the competitors workingtogether in the news-gathering process of a major foreignstory. According to Ed Turner, executive vice president ofCNN, the all-news network has been &quot;experimenting withnetworks on an ad hoc, event-by-event basis in some majorforeign stories for the past several months.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The cooperation underscores how the major networks are, inthe words of one CBS News official, &quot;grappling&quot; with mountingcosts in the coverage of overseas stories. The officialcharacterized the Polhill story as an &quot;experiment with how wecan all work together to save money without sacrificing ourcompetitive edge.&quot;   The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, saidthe news division, a unit of CBS Inc., would continue to worktogether with CNN in sharing equipment &quot;as long as we'vefirst satisfied Dan Rather,&quot; the anchor of the &quot;CBS EveningNews.&quot;   &quot;We think there is a plot by the Islamic Jihad for theLiberation of Palestine and the Syrian government to bankruptthe American networks,&quot; said CNN's Mr. Turner with some ironyin a telephone interview. &quot;The costs are too much.&quot;   Specifically, the networks cooperated covering differentso-called non-exclusive events last weekend in Damascus,Syria, where Mr. Polhill was brought after three years ofcaptivity in Beirut. CBS News and CNN also worked together inFrankfurt, West Germany, where Mr. Polhill was taken afterDamascus.   Eason Jordan, international managing editor of CNN, a unitof Turner Broadcasting System Inc., said, &quot;We all want ourshare of exclusives, but taping a hostage coming off a planeis something that we can cooperate on without losingeditorial independence.&quot;   &quot;The way we distinguish ourselves is through a CharlesKuralt or Bob Simon script,&quot; said the CBS official, referringto two CBS News correspondents.   NBC News, a division of General Electric Co.'s NationalBroadcasting Co. unit, shared some satellite time with theBritish Broadcasting Co. and did not work with its threecompetitors.   A spokesman at ABC News, a unit of Capital Cities/ABCInc., said there was &quot;nothing unusual&quot; about the Polhillcooperation. When there is no &quot;competitive advantage,&quot; thespokesman said, there are &quot;informal pool arrangements&quot;between the networks. The networks also shared the cost oftransmitting the news footage by satellite, and, indeed, thatis not unusual.   One network executive estimated that each news divisioncould have &quot;easily&quot; saved about $12,000 on last weekend'sstory. &quot;That's money that could go to enterprising stories,&quot;said the executive.   The cooperation between CNN and other networks, inparticular CBS News, is a drastic reversal for the all-newscable outlet. When CNN was first launched a decade ago, CBSNews crews were urged not to help any CNN crew, according toseveral CBS News employees. But the situation has clearlychanged. Indeed, CBS Inc. executives, including Senior VicePresident Jay Kriegel and Broadcast Group President HowardStringer, held at least one meeting with Turner Broadcastingexecutives in February about a possible partnership.   Although those talks have yet to prove fruitful, there isa possibility that CBS News and CNN might combine facilitiesin locations such as South Africa and Berlin.   The network news divisions are under enormous pressurefrom their cooperate parents to trim costs. CBS News, forinstance, has an annual operating budget of about $300million, but that includes the production of three prime-timeshows, including top rated &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;   Mr. Turner said domestically the networks rotate cameracrews on a weekly basis to cover press briefings given at thePentagon and State Department in Washington.   Most recently, for example, the three networks and CNNagreed to pool their election-polling units. &quot;It would havecost each network $12 million over four years to conduct exitpolls,&quot; said one official. &quot;And for what? We all would havegotten the same information.&quot;   Now, the official said, the networks and CNN will splitthe $12 million four ways. He added, &quot;And, when we can, whenit doesn't compromise our broadcasts or affiliates, that'swhat we'll do on foreign stories.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
