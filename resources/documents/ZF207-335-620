Muith.andM;Infodata is also building a bridge between Inquire and DB2 and SQL/DS throughSQL.andP;  This is due out in early 1990.andM;And Henco Software Inc., Waltham, Mass., is working on linking its Info-DB+text system to Digital Equipment Corp.'s RDB database.andM;Integration is espoused by Information Dimensions' Clark.andP;  &quot;We understandthat we have to fit into the corporate environment.andP;  Users are buyingdifferent products to fit different needs--they have one database managementsystem for text and another for data.&quot;andM;Text management software suppliers are finding innovative uses for the PC.andO;Mike McKinney, vice president of AskSam Systems, Perry, Fla., claims hisPc-based product running on a 386 machine can search a 4Mb database in 16seconds.andM;In a recent demonstration, the says, in 16 seconds AskSam picked up everyoccurrence of the word &quot;Jesus&quot; in a Bible stored on a 5.3Mb file.andP;  Themachine used for this demonstration was a 286 Compaq.andM;AskSam is based on linear string searches, a technique that is usually slowbecause it involves searches of all files on the disk instead of the searchof an index.andM;Another relatively new twist comes from Persoft Inc. In Madison, Wis.andO;According to David Haskin, product manager, the company's IZE key word-basedproduct not only provides a list of the documents that fit the searchcriteria, but allows users to &quot;see the information he or she seeks inrelationship to other information.&quot;andM;IZE analyzes the words in each document that fit the search criteria, andcompares that document to all the other documents that fit the criteria.andP;  Forexample, if a user were to ask for all documents that talk about OS/2 andcomputers, maybe IZE would come up with a list of 62 documents.andP;  Then IZEwill go through those 62 documents and tell the user that 41 of them have thewords &quot;IBM PS/2&quot; in them.andM;&quot;You would see that OS/2 is almost always discussed in relation with aspecific workstation,&quot; Haskin says.andP;  &quot;Before you made the request, you didn'teven know this relationship existed.&quot;andM;The DOS-based product has been shipping for about a year and sells for $445.andO;By the end of the summer, a beefed-up version with additional searchingfunctions will be ready, as will a network version.andM;VERITY'S &quot;CONCEPT&quot; RETRIEVALandM;Also on the market for about a year is Topic from verity Inc., Mountain View,Calif.andP;  The product has generated a lot of talk in the industry because it isbased on a new technique called concept retrieval.andP;  Documents areautomatically indexed by concept or topic.andP;  And then, instead of usingtraditional Boolean query language, users build a query based on differnettopics.andP;  The user is then presented with a list of documents that meet thecriteria, with each document given a percentage ranking of how close it fits.andM;According to Robert Williams, vice president of marketing for Verity, thissystem is up 1,000 times faster than traditional text retrieval systems.andO;Also, he says the index overhead is only about 70% as opposed to up to 150%for traditional systems.andP;  And the results are better than traditional systemsbecause a higher number of relevant documents are found, Williams adds.andM;Verify runs on a variety of machines including Digital Equipment Corp.,andO;DOS-based PCs, and Unix-based computers.andP;  Plans include bringing out versionsfor the Macintosh and OS/2 machines, Williams says.andM;The company has already struck deals to link its systems with popular, DBMSs,including Sybase, Oracle, and Informix.andP;  Verify on a PC sells for $695; a VAXversion goes for $39,500.andM;Indeed, many in the industry believe the text retrieval market is justbeginning.andP;  Henry Cochran, president of Henco Software Inc., Waltham, Mass,talks about &quot;a frame-based reference to information.andP;  That means I don't knowthe relationships between the information until I actually sit down and usethe information.andM;&quot;Those things should not be determined by someone else at the front end ofthe process,&quot; Cochran says.andP;  &quot;But with today's technology, that's whathappens.andP;  Information is pigeon-holed into predetermined categories.&quot;andP;  Hisgoal, he says, is to file information as an object and allow each user todetermine what it is for himself.andP;  This would allow someone to, for example,search through complaint letters for ideas and common threads without knowingexactly what he or she was looking for.andM;One investigator of this technology agrees that this technology still has alot of work ahead of it.andP;  Bob Gordon, senior scientist at Eastman-Kodak'sBoston Technology center, is looking into text retrieval as a way to handlepublishing requirements for graphics, fonts and, images.andM;&quot;Text retrieval isn't yet tuned exactly right because the words themselvesdon't come with semantics, so you have to go fishing,&quot; Gordon warns.andP;  &quot;Youcan't shape the queries exactly right.andP;  The classic example is 'pressing asuit.'andP;  Are we talking about a tailor or a lawyer?andP;  That are deep issues.&quot;andM;But, like ancient chinese proverb, these are also interesting times.andP;  &quot;Somuch is happening, it's like trying to drink from a fire hose,&quot; saysInfodata's Muith.andP;  &quot;You think this is neat?andP;  You ain't seen nothing yet.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
