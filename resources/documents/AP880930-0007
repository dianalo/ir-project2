Ecologists, in a lawsuit titled ``in the name of the seals,''had called for a ban on dumping industrial wastes in the North Sea,a spokeswoman for the Greenpeace environmental group said Thursday.   Greenpeace and other ecologists say a massive epidemic that iskilling off North Sea seals by the thousands was caused bypollution, a theory that some independent scientists dispute.   An administrative court in the West German city-state of Hamburgrejected the lawsuit on behalf of the seals, spokeswoman IngridJuetting of the Hamburg-based West German chapter of Greenpeacesaid.   The court requested proof of a causal connection between NorthSea pollution and mass seal deaths, Ms. Juetting said.   ``The court is requesting evidence that has long since beenscientifically proven,'' Ms. Juetting said, adding that theenvironmentalists will continue the legal battle.   Seven environmental groups besides Greenpeace, including theinternational World Wildlife Fund, were responsible for thelawsuit, Ms. Juetting said.   At least 7,000 harbor seals are estimated to have died in theNorth Sea since April, more than 2,000 of them in West German NorthSea waters alone.</TEXT></DOC>
