In the 1989 second quarter, Meritor had a loss of $21.2million, or 61 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   Roger S. Hillas, Meritor's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said Meritor has now completed the second stage of adifficult restructuring that began in late 1987. A debtrecapitalization plan, approved by federal regulatorsTuesday, will increase Meritor's shareholder equity by about$98 million, which will be reflected in the third quarter.Thus, Meritor will be in compliance with all the new capitalrequirements under the thrift bailout law passed last year.   The first stage of the restructuring was to shrinkMeritor, which in the early 1980s was the nation's largestthrift. Total assets have been reduced by nearly 70% to about$7 billion at the end of June from a peak of $21.5 billion.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved a plan torecapitalize a Meritor savings and loan unit, Meritor SavingsFA, headquartered in Winter Haven, Fla. The recapitalizationallowed the thrift to exchange about $172 million of debt for$42 million in cash and $18 million in new debt.   The regulatory approval for this debt swap gave Meritorenough capital leeway to take other steps needed to completeits restructuring and eventually return the company toprofitability, Mr. Hillas said.   Those steps include an increase of $35 million in itsprovision for loan losses. Other costs and charges for thequarter include: the termination of interest-rate swap andfloor contracts at a cost of $55 million, the creation of a$54 million reserve for expenses from unused office space,and $303 million in costs and charges, including a goodwillwrite-off of $172 million connected with the company's saleof 54 branches to Mellon Bank Corp.   &quot;Now the balance sheet is really representative of whatthe company's worth,&quot; said Mr. Hillas.   Mr. Hillas must turn his attention to making thenow-smaller thrift profitable again. He said he expectsMeritor could be showing an operating profit by the secondhalf of 1991. &quot;But we can't control interest rates and thereal estate market malaise,&quot; he said. The challenge for Mr.Hillas will be to rotate low fixed-income assets andhigh-rate liabilities with assets that provide a higher rateof return and lower-cost liabilities or deposits.   David Penn, a bank analyst with Legg Mason in Baltimore,says Meritor has another hurdle it must overcome before itreturns to profitability: A high level of nonperformingassets, about 5%, of total assets, which are a drag onearnings.   Mr. Hillas noted that there were some large nonperformingreal estate loans, which the bank has helped customers workout in recent years, that could begin accruing interest onceagain before year end. Yet he admits that while Meritordoesn't have any &quot;undue&quot; real estate problem, &quot;they could goon for a while.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
