The subsidies had been approved by a Bush administration interagency task force but final arrangements hadn't been made and the subsidized sales hadn't been announced by the department, according to Richard Crowder, undersecretary of agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs.    Until the information was disclosed Monday at a congressional hearing on the so-called export enhancement program, the administration had planned to subsidize the sale of 100,000 tons of wheat to Yemen, 100,000 tons of barley malt to Brazil and 50,000 tons of barley to Iraq.    In a brief statement, Mr. Crowder said he had to cancel the subsidy offers &quot;to maintain the integrity of the program with respect to market sensitivity&quot; and to protect the nation's reputation overseas as a &quot;reliable and trusted supplier.&quot;    Department officials treat the status of export subsidy proposals as insider information. Leaks of such information could give traders an unfair advantage in the commodities markets and could enable foreign competitors, such as European Community nations, to undercut U.S. grain sales with lower prices.    &quot;This information is market sensitive and was not authorized for release,&quot; Mr. Crowder said of a list of pending proposals that a General Accounting Office official gave to members of a House Agriculture subcommittee in responding to questions.    Mr. Crowder faulted the subcommittee for the leak, but Rep. Dan Glickman, the subcommittee chairman, countered that the GAO was to blame. The GAO official shouldn't have passed the list out at a public hearing, the Kansas Democrat said. &quot;Once that happened, the document became public.&quot;    He and Rep. David Nagle (D., Iowa) said that Mr. Crowder should have objected to the list's release at the hearing.    Export subsidies are offered to counter what the administration regards as unfair trade practices, mostly by the European Community. Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. grain at prices below those in the U.S. to meet foreign competition, and they then collect government-owned surplus grain as so-called bonuses, or subsidies.    At the hearing, Mr. Crowder and GAO witnesses testified that the program has succeeded in boosting U.S. farm exports. There have been $8.4 billion in subsidized exports since the program was established by the 1985 farm law, with the subsidies coming to nearly $2.6 billion. About half of the $770 million alloted for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, has been awarded, mostly for wheat sales.    Mr. Glickman pointed out that &quot;the GAO came out with a glowing report on the program.&quot; At the same time, because of its size, the program &quot;deserves &quot;good, solid oversight&quot; by Congress, he added.    Mr. Crowder said that the canceled subsidy proposals can be resubmitted for review. Yesterday's action won't affect subsidies that have been announced or the &quot;overall functioning&quot; of the program, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
