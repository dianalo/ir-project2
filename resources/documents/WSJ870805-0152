They are the makings of a tiny video camera that Mr. Lee and 20 other Samsung Electronics Co. engineers are designing. &quot;The electronic circuitry and the mechanical designs are very difficult,&quot; says Mr. Lee. Replacing the paper, he adds: &quot;And very secret.&quot;    Despite the camera's confidential innards, Samsung makes no secret of its intentions. Already a big player in the export market for cheap mass-market consumer electronics, the company wants to muscle into the lucrative market for small video cameras currently dominated by Japan. &quot;Until now we've made low-end models,&quot; says Mr. Lee. &quot;But Samsung is coming up to a higher stage.&quot;    Samsung's camera, which uses matchbox-size tapes, illustrates a shift that is just beginning in Korean industry. After quickly becoming tough international contenders in markets for inexpensive manufactured products, Korean companies want to move up-market, using more-advanced technologies to produce better video recorders, plusher cars, more-sophisticated computers -- and fatter profits.    The government has chipped in with big grants and with policies aimed at increasing Korea's exports of advanced manufactured products in the next decade. &quot;Korea is in a transition right now from low-end mass production to high-value-added, high-technology items,&quot; or relatively expensive goods with high profit margins, says Min Pyung June, a senior managing director of the huge Goldstar Co.    Koreans won't be making supercomputers or flashy sports cars soon. Much of the change taking place is really a shift in emphasis, and the new products are mostly still at the drawing-board stage. Indeed, some Japanese experts scoff at the idea of Korea catching up in the high-quality markets dominated by manufacturers in Japan and the West.    But Korean industry has confounded skeptics before. Western analysts say a step up the high-tech scale is inevitable as Korea's currency becomes stronger, labor costs rise and less-developed Asian neighbors nibble at the lower-quality product markets.    Samsung's paperback-sized camcorder, as such camera-plus-recorder devices are called, offers just the kind of advances that Korean makers are seeking. The prototype is the first to use the four millimeter-wide tapes used with digital-audiotape players, rather than the 8mm and 13mm tapes favored by Japanese makers. More important for Korea's high-tech industry, Samsung's engineers designed the miniature camcorder themselves.    If successful, the camcorder will place Samsung in the midst of one of Japan's newest and most profitable markets. Japan expects to sell 3.9 million camcorders this year, up 54% from 1986.    A prototype of Samsung's camcorder, which cost $2.2 million to develop, created a stir last year at an American electronics show. Samsung plans to begin selling the device, which will cost two million won (about $2,500), in Korea before the 1988 Summer Olympics and expects it to gain a 5% world-wide market share when exports are started next year. &quot;In four years we think the 4mm camcorder will lead the market,&quot; says Samsung's Mr. Lee.    Samsung, Goldstar and other Korean electronics makers aren't satisfied with their low-end share of other consumer markets, either. They are developing high-definition televisions that provide movielike picture quality, for example.    &quot;They're saying: 'Hey, look, we can do it too,'&quot; says Peter Wolff, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd. &quot;They know they're not going to get their technology from Japan. So they'll do it themselves. I'll give them a fair chance of doing it.&quot;    In the past, Korean companies relied on mostly outdated technologies transferred from Japan and the West to produce low-cost goods. The results were spectacular. Last year Korea's videotape-recorder exports rose 142% from 1985, to $500 million. In the same period, semiconductor exports increased 42%, to $1.4 billion. And Korean companies exported 306,000 cars, mostly no-frill subcompacts, such as Hyundai Motor Co.'s Excel and Pony models, up from only 123,000 in 1985.    The main reason is low prices. But these aren't enough to insure future growth. So Hyundai is testing a new medium-priced model that the company hopes to export to the U.S. &quot;in the very near future,&quot; Mr. Lee says.    The markets that Korea has its eyes on are Japan's prime markets. Electronics companies, such as Daewoo Telecom Co. and Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., have locked onto the market for inexpensive &quot;IBM compatibles&quot; -- personal computers able to use software written for International Business Machines Corp.'s machines. Now they are moving up to models with more features and are developing powerful personal computers known as workstations.    In the drive by Korean companies to sell sophisticated equipment abroad, the government is acting as a cheerleader. A development program by the Science and Technology Ministry calls for Korea to capture 10% of the market for workstations by the year 2001. And the government's telecommunications research institute has joined forces with Daewoo, Samsung, Goldstar and other companies in a $70 million crash program to design a Korean superminicomputer by 1990. (Superminicomputers are fast general-purpose machines that can cost several hundred thousand dollars.)    The strong yen and U.S. restrictions on Japanese semiconductor exports have helped Korean companies garner a significant share of the market in 256-kilobit memory chips -- fingernail-sized semiconductors that store more than 256,000 pieces of information. Now Daewoo and Goldstar are developing more complex chips such as microcontrollers, the &quot;brains&quot; of such appliances as microwave ovens, and so-called application-specific integrated circuits that combine the functions of several types of computer chip on a single chip.    Skeptics say Korean talk of moving up-market is over-ambitious. The country trails far behind in most technologies, they say, and particularly in integrating diverse technologies into products such as the tiny four-millimeter camera that Samsung hopes to sell. &quot;Japan is the only one that can do that kind of development,&quot; says Yuzuru Inoue, a deputy general manager at Victor Co. of Japan.    Still, officials say, Korean engineers are beginning to design their own products, rather than manufacture another country's designs.    The doubters have been wrong before. And in these heady days of Korean economic growth, the sky is the limit for Korea's ambitions to move up-market. &quot;In 20 years,&quot; says Park Un-Suh, director-general of the Ministry of Trade and Industry's industrial policy bureau, &quot;we may be challenging the aircraft industry and the satellite industry.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
