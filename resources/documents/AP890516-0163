In the occupied territories, Israeli troops shot and killed twoPalestinians and wounded at least 17, Arab reports said. The armyconfirmed one dead and five wounded.   Also Tuesday, a 50-year-old Palestinian jailed for securityreasons, Mohammed Assad Fukaha, died of dehydration suffered in ahunger strike at Megiddo prison in northern Israel where he washeld for eight months, military sources said.   An army spokesman confirmed the death.   Officials said the expulsion of Arab laborers was intended topunish Gaza residents for anti-Israeli activities in the 17-monthPalestinian uprising.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the order may be widened toinclude the occupied West Bank, adding he hoped the penalty wouldpersuade Palestinians to end their violent campaign against Israelirule.   About 60,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and 50,000 from theGaza Strip work in Israel.   Even a temporary ban could cause severe hardship for Palestinianlaborers, who have few employment opportunities in the occupiedlands.   ``If I don't go to work or I get sent home, the store owner willfire me,'' said a Gazan worker in Tel Aviv, speaking on conditionhis name not be used. ``Where am I going to get food for mychildren?''   Police Commissioner David Krauss warned on the radio Tuesdaythat if Gazans do not leave, ``we will begin detaining workers andreturning them to Gaza.''   Rabin said: ``The intention is to warn the residents thatpermission for free travel and work in Israel are not givens. Theydepend on the behavior of those who leave for work.''   Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron told a parliament committee theexpulsions were ``a punishment measure'' and said Israeli leadersconsidered and rejected banning all Palestinian labor in Israel.   Gaza has been the site of most of the latest stone-throwingclashes with Israeli soldiers. Police also have said they suspectPalestinians from Gaza kidnapped one soldier and murdered anotherwhose body was found last week.   In Gaza on Tuesday, 13-year-old Yasser Mahmoud El-Dranee diedwhen shot in the neck by Israeli troops in Jabaliya refugee camp,hospital officials said.   In the West Bank town of Nablus, troops shot and killed YassinAnabulsy, 21, in a clash with stone-throwers, the army said.   At least 479 Palestinians have died as a result of the uprisingthat began in December 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.   Arab reports said 12 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds inGaza and five in the West Bank, including a 15-year-old criticallyhurt with a bullet wound in the heart.   In the West Bank town of Hebron, stone-throwing attacks onJewish settlers' cars were reported. Israel radio said one settler,injured in the head, fell down and his gun accidentally fired,hitting another settler in the leg.   Arab reports said dozens of settlers from nearby Kiryat Arbalater attacked Arab cars in Hebron, breaking windshields and firingin the air. Troops firing tear gas clashed with stone-throwing Arabyouths shouting ``Allahu akbar!'' (God is great), they said.   It was uncertain how many Gaza workers police rounded up. Manycould not report to work anyway because an indefinite curfewdeclared Monday night confined Gaza's 700,000 residents to theirhomes.   At the Erez crossing into Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian workerssat on the ground under army guard. They had been transported byIsraeli taxis and were being taken into Gaza by army trucks.   Paramilitary border police went through Tel Aviv's Carmel Marketdemanding Arabs' identity cards. Gaza residents were told to leaveby Tuesday night, witnesses said.   Dennis Ross, head of policy planning at the State Department,returned to Israel from talks in Egypt and Jordan on Israel'sproposal to hold elections in the occupied lands as a first step ina peace process there.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens flew to Washington on Tuesday fortalks with U.S. officials on the plan.   ``Potential opportunity'' exists for advancing the peaceprocess, Ross told reporters after talking to Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir.   He also met five Palestinian leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
