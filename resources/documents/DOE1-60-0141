Theuse of dry gas seals and active magnetic bearings will effectively eliminatethe further use of oil systems in gas compression. The paper deals withthe history of Trans-Canada PipeLines' past experiences with oil-freeseals, the theory of dry gas seals and active magnetic bearings, theeffects of magnetic bearings on rotor dynamics, and the recent installationand operation of a set of dry gas seals and active magnetic bearingsin a booster compressor unit operating on the TansCanada PipeLines system.</TEXT></DOC>
