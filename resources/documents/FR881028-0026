Authority </ITAG>This notice of final rulemaking is issued under the authority of TitleIII of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C.1431 <T3>et seq</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Background </ITAG>On October 19, 1984, President Reagan approved Pub. L. No. 98-498; TitleI of Pub. L. No. 98-498, referred to as the Marine Sanctuaries Amendmentsof 1984 (the Act or the Amendments), authorizes appropriations throughFY 1988 for, and makes revisions to, Title III of the Marine Protection,Research, and Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C. 1431 <T3>et seq</T3>. The National Marine Sanctuary Program is administeredby the Marine and Estuarine Management Division, National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, Department of Commerce. The Amendments set out the purposesand policies of the National Marine Sanctuary Program, establish specificcriteria and procedures for designating and implementing National MarineSanctuaries, and provide for greater participation by the Congress, theRegional Fishery Management Councils (established by the Magnuson FisheryConservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq</T3>.), and other affected agencies or persons. The designationstandards set forth in the Amendments basically track the site identificationand selection standards and active candidate criteria used to identifypotential National Marine Sanctuaries, and evaluate sites for designation.On June 12, 1986, NOAA published proposed regulations for continued implementationof the National Marine Sanctuary Program, pursuant to the Act (51 FR 21369).Written comments on the proposed regulations were accepted until August11, 1986. These comments have been considered in preparing these finalregulations. The final regulations set forth the Program's mission and goals, amendprocedures for revising the Site Evaluation List (SEL), set forth siteidentification and selection criteria for including areas of the marineenvironment possessing historical resources of special national significanceon the SEL, revise the sanctuary designation standards and process, andinitiate a consultation process with Congress and Regional Fishery ManagementCouncils (when regulations on fisheries activities are affected) priorto commencing the environmental review process required pursuant to theNational Environmental Policy Act. These regulations supersede the previousregulations for the program (48 FR 24296 (1983)). <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Refinements to the Regulations for the National Marine SanctuaryProgram </ITAG>The proposed regulations solicited comments on procedural and policy revisionsrequired to implement the Amendments. These modifications and how theyare reflected in the final regulations are discussed below.   A. Findings, Purpose, and Policies The Amendments add findings which recognize that certain areas of the marineenvironment possess ``conservation, recreational, ecological, historical,research, educational or esthetic qualities which give them special nationalsignificance'' (Section 301(a)). This differs from the original Act, whichprovided, in section 302(a), that National Marine Sanctuaries should bedesignated only for their ``conservation, recreational, ecological, oresthetic values'' (Section 302, Pub. L. No. 92-532, codified at 16 U.S.C.1432(a) (1983)). To reflect the addition of historical qualities, NOAA'sworking list of potential sites is being amended (See IV.A. of the Preambleand Subpart B of the regulations). Consistent with the Amendments purposeand policies, the National Marine Sanctuary Program provides for comprehensivemanagement and conservation, including the support and coordination ofscientific research involving the resources of marine sanctuaries, stressesefforts to enhance public awareness, understanding, appreciation, and wiseuse of the marine environment; and encourages public and private uses ofsuch resources consistent with the Program's primary objective to protectthem (Section 301(b) (2)-(5)). These policies are reflected in the Program'smission and goals set forth at andSection;922.1. B. Designation Standards The Secretary of Commerce may designate a discrete area of the ``marineenvironment'' as a National Marine Sanctuary, if he finds that: (a) the area is of special national significance due to its resource orhuman-use values; (b) Existing state and Federal authorities are inadequate to ensure coordinatedand comprehensive management of the area, including resource protection,scientific research and public education; (c) Designation of the area as a National Marine Sanctuary will facilitatethe objectives in subparagraph (b); and (d) The area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive andcoordinated conservation and management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 303(a)). These findings are reflected at andSection;922.33(a) of the final regulations.C. Consultation In making the above findings, the Secretary must consult with the HouseCommittee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries; the Senate Committee on Commerce,Science, and Transportation; the Secretaries of State, Defense, Transportation,and the Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,and the heads of other interested Federal agencies; the responsible officialsor relevant agency heads of the appropriate state or local government entities,including the coastal zone management agencies, that will or are likelyto be affected by the establishment of the area as a National Marine Sanctuary;the appropriate officials of any Regional Fishery Management Council establishedby section 302 of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1852) that may be affectedby a proposed designation; and other interested persons. The consultationprocess for a potential designation is set forth in the final regulationsat andSection;922.31. Further, the Secretary of Commerce prepares, as part of an environmentalimpact statement, a resource assessment report regarding the commercialand recreational uses in the area proposed for designation. The Secretarymust consult with the Secretary of the Interior with respect to any usesin the area subject to the primary jurisdiction of the Department of theInterior (See section 303(b) (2) and (3)). The requirement for preparationof the resource assessment report is set forth in the final regulationsat andSection;922.31(h). D. Fishery Regulations Where fishery regulations are necessary, the Secretary shall provide theappropriate regional Fishery Management Council the opportunity to recommendto the Secretary draft sanctuary fishery regulations. This requirementis set forth in the final regulations at andSection;922.31(f). E. Designation A proposed designation of a National Marine Sanctuary becomes effectiveafter the close of a review period of forty-five (45) days of continuoussession of Congress, commencing with the publication of a notice of thedesignation and final implementing regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, unless: (1) The designation or any of its terms is disapproved by enactment ofa joint resolution of disapproval by Congress; or (2) In the case of a proposed sanctuary located partially or entirely withinstate boundaries, the Governor of the affected state objects to the designationor any of its terms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If the Secretary determines that disapproval of or objection to aproposed designation will affect the designation in a manner such thatsanctuary goals and objectives cannot be fulfilled, the Secretary may withdrawthe designation. Section 922.34 governs designation. F. Access and Valid Rights Section 304(c) of the Act provides that the Secretary may not terminateleases, permits, and rights of subsistence use or access either in existenceon October 19, 1984 (the date of enactment of Pub. L. No. 98-498) for thenexisting National Marine Sanctuaries, or in existence on the date new nationalmarine sanctuaries are designated pursuant to the Amendments. However,section 304(c) also provides that the exercise of such leases, permitsor rights is ``subject to regulation by the Secretary consistent with thepurposes for which the sanctuary is designated.'' The provisions of section304(c) are set forth at andSection;922.11 of the final regulations.   G. Research and EducationThe Amendments, at section 306, specify that the Secretary may conductresearch and education programs to carry out the purposes of the Act. Researchand education are specifically discussed at andSection; 992.40(a) of thefinal regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Sanctuary Designation Process</ITAG>The revisions contained in the Amendments, discussed above, make severalmodifications to the sanctuary designation process. This section describesthe revised designation process, which is depicted in summary form in Figure1. A. Site Evaluation ListTo identify sites for future consideration as national marine sanctuaries,NOAA instituted a site evaluation process in 1982; this process culminatedin a list of sites, the SEL, which was published in 1983 (48 FR 35568).As initially established, the SEL consisted of twenty-nine (29) naturalresource sites. The SEL serves as NOAA's working list for possible nationalmarine sanctuary designation and is discussed in subpart B of the regulations.The qualities expressed in the original Act were used in establishing theSEL; thus, the SEL was focused on sites with conservation, recreational,ecological, or esthetic qualities. While the Amendments add historical, research, and educational qualities,sites possessing research and educational qualities were solicited andconsidered in the original SEL process. Research and educational qualitiesare inherent in sites possessing significant conservation, recreational,ecological, and esthetic values; consequently, sites possessing researchand educational qualities of special national significance are includedon the current SEL. Sites of nationally significant historical qualitywere not, however, considered in the SEL process; the evaluation teamsdid not include maritime archeologists or historians or any person schooledin submerged cultural resources. There are no historical sites on the SEL.Thus, the SEL list now requires revision to include discrete marine areaspossessing nationally significant historical qualities for possible conservationand management as provided by the Act. Provisions for the revision of theSEL are set forth at andSection; 922.22. In these regulations, NOAA's useof the term ``historical'' comports with the Act in encompassing cultural,archeological, and paleontological elements. B. Designation of National Marine SanctuariesSelection of a site from the SEL as an active candidate represents thesecond phase in evaluating a site for potential designation; it beginsthe environmental impact statement process. Notice of selection as an activecandidate and intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement(DEIS) is placed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. At any time a site can be dropped from considerationif it is determined that a site does not meet the standard and criteriaset forth in the Act. After selection as an active candidate, a draft management plan (includingnecessary regulations) is prepared along with a draft environmental impactstatement (DEIS). The DEIS evaluates the impacts of sanctuary designationand management plan implementation. During the preparation of the DEIS,a resource assessment report is prepared documenting present and potentialuses of the area, including commercial and recreational fishing, researchand education, minerals and energy development, subsistence uses, and othercommercial or recreational uses. In consultation with the Secretary ofthe Interior, a resource assessment section is prepared regarding any commercialor recreational resource uses in the area under consideration that aresubject to the primary jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior (Section303(b)(3)). After the DEIS and draft plan are prepared, a notice of proposeddesignation is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and media serving communities which may be affectedby the designation. On the same day that the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice is issued, a detailed prospectus on thedesignation proposal (which includes the DEIS and draft plan), as discussedin andSection; 922.32(a), is sent to the House Merchant Marine and FisheriesCommittee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committeefor review for a forty-five (45) day period of continuous session. After preparation of a final EIS and final management plan, including proposedfinal regulations, the Secretary of Commerce must determine whether todesignate the area as a National Marine Sanctuary. Section 922.33(a) ofthe regulations sets forth the factors considered by the Secretary in makingthis determination. Designated sanctuaries should be illustrative of thenation's marine areas and allow for coordinated and comprehensive management.Generally, decisions to designate areas as National Marine Sanctuariesare based on an evaluation of the area's natural and historical resourceand human-use values; the effects of present and future uses on these valuesand the effects of designation on these uses; the adequacy of existingstate and Federal management of the area; whether designation will ensurecomprehensive management; the area's size and manageability, (<T3>e.g.,</T3> it is anticipated that the maximum size will not exceedthat of the largest existing national marine sanctuary, the Channel IslandsNational Marine Sanctuary (1252 square nautical miles)); the fiscal capabilityto designate and operate any given area; and the public benefits to bederived from designation. Notice of designation is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The designation becomes effective after theclose of a second Congressional review period (and Governor's review forsites including state waters) of forty-five (45) days of continuous sessionof Congress, dating from the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of designation (See andSection; 922.34).If the terms of the designation are found acceptable by Congress, and theGovernor(s), for sites including any state waters, the Secretary will implementthe management plan, including surveillance and enforcement activities,and such research and education programs as are necessary and reasonableto carry out the purposes and policies of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Figure</T4> 1._<T4>Sanctuary Designation Process (Summary) </T4><H1>Process stage </H1><H1>Action </H1><H1>Notice</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Site Evaluation List (SEL) Established<D>Final SEL</D><D>FR Notice.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selection as Active Candidate <D>Site selected from SEL as ``Active Candidate''</D><D>FR Notice; Public Notice of Selection.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposed Designation (STARTS NEPA PROCESS)<D>Development of Designation Materials</D><D>Notice of Intent to Prepare DEIS.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Regional Scoping Meeting</D><D>FR Notice; Public Notice.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Consultations with Congress, affected Regional Fishery Management Councils,states, Federal agencies, and other interested persons; preparation ofDEIS, Draft Management Plan, Proposed Regulations, and Resource AssessmentReport</D><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Prospectus to Congress (including Draft EIS and Draft Management Plan,proposed regulations for review under Section 304 of the Act)</D><D>FR Notice (including proposed regulations and summary of Draft ManagementPlan published concurrently with Draft EIS availability of Prospectus toCongress); Public Notice.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Public Hearing</D><D>FR Notice; Public Notice.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Prepare Final EIS/Management Plan and Designation Determination andFindings</D><D>Occurs within three years of selection as Active Candidate.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Designation<D>If site meets criteria, Secreatary then designates the national marinesanctuary</D><D>FR Notice (Designation, final regulations; availability of Final EIS/FinalManagement Plan Notice to Congress (304(b)).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Designation effective after 45-day period for Congressional and GubernatorialReview under Section 304(b) of the Act</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">V. Summary of Significant Comments on the Proposed Regulations andNOAA's Responses</ITAG>NOAA received comments from five sources. Commenters included Federal andstate agencies and representatives of the oil and gas industry. All commentsreceived are on file at the Marine and Estuarine Management Division, Officeof Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and are available at that officefor review upon request. Each of the major issues raised by commentershas been summarized and NOAA's responses are provided under the relevantsubheading in this section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Subpart B_Site Evaluation ListProposed andSection;922.20(c)_One reviewer suggested that the additionalcriteria_historical, research, and education_to be considered when selectingsites did not sufficiently address the unique attributes of urban estuarineareas. The reviewer also noted that the research and educational valuesof urban estuarine systems may not necessarily be recognized within thecontext of conservation, recreational, ecological or esthetic values.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA recognizes the importance of urban estuarine areasand their research and educational values and believes that these valuesare sufficiently represented by the designation standards set out in section303(a) of the Act. However, as stated in andSection;922.1(c)(i), priorityconsideration will be given to offshore areas where there are no otherexisting special area protection mechanisms. The commenter should alsoconsider State, local and city governments as well as the National CoastalZone Management Program for protection of urban estuarine areas.Proposed andSection;922.21(a)_One reviewer suggested that the proposed regulationswere not consistent with established cultural resource procedures in thatsites do not attain national significance until they have been designatedNational Historic Landmarks (NHL) and that under the proposed rules a sitecould be designated as a national marine sanctuary without being nationallysignificant, <T3>i.e.</T3>, designated as an NHL.<T3>Response:</T3> In accordance with the Act, a site does not have tobe designated an NHL or listed on the National Register to be considerednationally significant. In a cultural resource management context, SELselection based on the criteria used for evaluating NHL eligibility conformswith existing cultural resource procedures in that established uniformstandards are used to identify important historical properties worthy ofprotection, preservation, research and interpretation. Designation as anNHL is not a prerequisite to SEL selection, nor does SEL selection necessarilyimply nomination as an NHL. The SEL serves as the preliminary process forthe identification and evaluation of sites having special national significancefor possible designation as National Marine Sanctuaries. After placementon the SEL, sites are further evaluated when selected as Active Candidatesfor sanctuary designation. Nomination as an NHL may result from the documentationcompiled during the SEL process and Active Candidate evaluation; however,such designation is distinct from the purposes of designation as a NationalMarine Sanctuary under the Act.Another reviewer suggested that if all sites on the SEL are nationallysignificant, that they would also be NHLs and, therefore, subject to theprovisions of the regulations published by the Advisory Council on HistoricPreservation for protecting cultural resources (36 CFR Part 800).<T3>Response:</T3> Sites selected for placement on the SEL do not haveto be NHLs and, therefore, do not necessarily fall under the Advisory Council'sregulations. If, however, any site selected for placement on the SEL isalready an NHL, it remains subject to those regulations.Proposed andSection;922.21(b)_One reviewer suggested that the public commentperiod be lengthened to 90 days for review of proposed historical sitesprior to their being added to the SEL.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees with this comment and the regulations havebeen modified accordingly.Proposed andSection;922.22_One reviewer suggested that the phrase ``or state''be added after ``Federal'' in the first sentence since the statement doesnot preclude states from restricting activities on areas prior to formalsite designation.<T3>Response:</T3> The listing of a site on the SEL does not subject thesite to Federal regulation under the Act. The status quo for the site is,therefore, unchanged. Accordingly, an area listed on the SEL is still subjectto both Federal and state regulation under other authorities. The effectof inclusion of a site on the SEL is set forth at andSection;922.20(c).Subpart C_Designation of National Marine SanctuariesProposed andSection;922.33(a)(2)(B)_One reviewer suggested that managementplans for sanctuaries designated at historically significant sites do notneed additional measures to protect the site from disturbances relatedto outer continental shelf (OCS) mineral development activities becauseadequate protections are already in place.<T3>Response:</T3> We acknowledge that the Department of the Interior (DOI)has responsibility for mitigating any adverse impact on historically significantsites from disturbances related to OCS mineral development activities.However, mitigation of adverse impact from OCS mineral development activitiesdoes not provide for coordinated and comprehensive management includingscientific research, public education, and interpretation. A major goalof the National Marine Sanctuary Program is to enhance resource protectionthrough comprehensive <ITAG tagnum="54">and coordinated conservation and management that complements existingregulatory authorities. The provisions of the Act enhance and complementthe existing DOI historical resource protection program. The National MarineSanctuary Program is the only mechanism to date for the protection, conservation,research, and interpretation of nationally significant historical resourcesbeyond the territorial sea (see andSection; 922.2(d) for the definition ofmarine environment). To ensure that all existing authorities are properlycoordinated, it is essential that the management plan for any sanctuarydesignated at any nationally significant historical site address comprehensiveprotection, including, but not limited to, potential threats from OCS mineraldevelopment activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Proposed Appendix I_National Marine Sanctuary Program Site Identificationand Selection Criteria for Sites With Historical Qualities of Special NationalSignificance</ITAG>One reviewer suggested that the word ``special'' be deleted from the ``specialnational significance'' criterion for identification and selection becausea site on the NHL may not meet the criteria for placement on the SEL.<T3>Response: </T3>By specifying that only areas of ``special'' nationalsignificance may be designated a National Marine Sanctuary under the Act,some NHL sites may not qualify for consideration as a National Marine Sanctuary.The cultural resource component of the National Marine Sanctuary Programis intended to be very selective, illustrative of the Nation's maritimeheritage and representative of the Nation's most significant historicalmarine resources. Thus, it is possible that some NHLs will not be consideredfor sanctuary designation. All historical National Marine Sanctuaries designatedin the future will be eligible to be designated as NHLs, but all marine-situatedNHLs may not necessarily be considered for designation as National MarineSanctuaries.A reviewer commented that references to the World Heritage List (WHL) arenot relevant in making SEL decisions. <T3>Response: </T3>Since all future historical National Marine Sanctuarieswill be eligible to be nominated as NHLs and because many of these NationalMarine Sanctuaries may also be internationally significant, it is appropriateto specify that some may be listed on the WHL. The use of the evaluationcriteria for the WHL as the established uniform standard to evaluate internationalsignificance is consistent with cultural resources procedures and policies.Additionally, it recognizes the international nature of maritime culturalresources and emphasizes that consistent with the overall mission, theNational Marine Sanctuary Program will coordinate its efforts to managemarine areas of special national significance with other countries managingmarine protected areas.<ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Other Actions Associated with the Notice of Final Rulemaking</ITAG>(A)Classification Under Executive Order 12291NOAA has concluded that these regulations are not major ``rules'' withinsection 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 because they will not result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.These final rules amend existing procedures by providing greater selectivityand specifity in initially identifying and designating potential NationalMarine Sanctuaries in accordance with the Marine Sanctuaries Amendmentsof 1984, Pub. L. 98-498. These rules establish a revised process for identifying,designating and managing National Marine Sanctuaries. They will not resultin any direct economic or environmental effects, nor will they lead toany major indirect economic or environment impacts. They are intended toreduce delay and uncertainty in the site selection and approval process.All subsequent marine sanctuary designations and implementing regulationsincluding any regulations recommended by the Fishery Management Councilswill be reviewed for compliance with Executive Order 12291.(B) Regulatory Flexibility Act AnalysisA Regulatory Analysis is not required for this notice of final rulemaking.The regulations set forth procedures for identifying, selecting, and, ifdesignated, managing National Marine Sanctuaries. Because the notice andcomment requirements of section 553 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code are notapplicable to this proposed procedural rule (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)), theRegulatory Flexibility Act also does not apply (5 U.S.C. 603(a)). All subsequentmarine sanctuary designations and implementing regulations will be reviewedfor compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.(C) Paper Work Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511)These regulations do not contain a collection of information for purposesof the Paperwork Reduction Act.(D) National Environmental Policy ActNOAA has concluded that publication of these final rules does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 922</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Coastal zone, Environmental protection,Marine resources, Natural resources.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.

Only sites on the SEL may be considered by the Secretaryfor subsequent review as ``Active Candidates'' for designation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The original SEL was based on the then existing Marine Research, Protection,and Sanctuaries Act, which provided that national marine sanctuaries couldbe designated for their conservation, recreational, ecological, or estheticvalues. It consisted of twenty-nine (29) marine sites with high naturalresource values, identified and recommended for inclusion on the SEL byregional resource evaluation teams in accordance with the National MarineSanctuary Program's mission and goals and then existent site identificationand selection criteria (48 FR 24296, May 31, 1983). The Marine SanctuariesAmendments of 1984 (Pub. L. No. 98-498) amended the Act to add additionalqualities_historical, research, or education_which must also be consideredwhen selecting sanctuary sites.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Areas of nationally significant research and educational qualitieswere considered in establishing the original SEL. These qualities are inherentin sites possessing significant conservation, recreational, ecological,or esthetic value. Therefore, additional areas of significant researchand educational values will not be reconsidered at this time, except asprovided in andSection; 922.21 of the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sites possessing nationally significant historical resources werenot specifically considered when establishing the original SEL. There areno historical sites on the SEL. The existing SEL now needs to be amendedto add areas of the marine environment possessing historical qualitiesof special national significance. Thus, the existing site identificationand selection criteria have been amended to incorporate more specific criteriato identify and select areas of the marine environment possessing historicalqualities of special national significance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Site Identification and Selection Criteria</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following criteria are grouped into four categories: (1) Naturalresource values; (2) human use/historical resource values; (3) potentialactivity impacts; and (4) management concerns. The criteria under eachcategory reflect concerns significant to the National Marine SanctuaryProgram and are designed to ensure that sites recommended to NOAA for SELconsideration have high natural resource and human resource values.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In selecting sites for the SEL, NOAA also considers the extent informationon the site is available, existing and potential activity impacts and managementconcerns (as presented in sections III and IV, below). NOAA's selectionof sites for the SEL is only the first of several determinations beforesanctuary designation or subsequent rejection of the site as not qualifiedfor sanctuary status.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the SEL stage, NOAA's prime focus is on the site's natural resourceand human use/historical resource values. The presence of such high valuesis a requisite or ``minimum'' requirement for NOAA's further considerationsince the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act emphasizes theprotection and management of marine areas which are of special nationalsignificance based on the site's conservation, recreational, ecological,historical, research, educational or esthetic qualities. Other, more specificissues are factored into NOAA's decision whether to select a site as anActive Candidate (see Subpart C of the regulations).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To determine if an area possesses historical values of special nationalsignificance and otherwise meets the Sanctuary designation standards specifiedin Section 303 of the Act, certain definitions and criteria are includedin this appendix (see II.F) for use in evaluating these potential sitesfor listing on the SEL in accordance with andSection; 922.22 of the regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">I.

Historical, Cultural, Archeological or Paleontological Significance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The area under consideration contains (or is likely to contain) historicalresources of special national significance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Definitions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The term ``historical'' as defined in andSection; 922.2(c) means possessinghistorical, cultural, archeological or paleontological significance, includingsites, structures, districts and objects significantly associated withor representative of earlier people, cultures, and human activities andevents. The term is used in the broad sense to refer to both pre-historicand historic periods, to the anthropological concept of culture, and tothe processes, events, places, and objects related to the human past. Thephrase ``special national significance'' in the context of historical areasdenotes those areas with historical values of unique national significanceand which are illustrative of the nation's maritime heritage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Criteria for Identification and Selection </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The site identification criteria to be used by the Marine HistoricalResource Evaluation Team to make its recommendation to the Secretary andthe criteria to be used by the Secretary for selection of recommended sitesfor inclusion on the SEL are the same. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To qualify for recommendation to the Secretary and for selection forlisting on the SEL because of a site's historical values, a site must havespecial national significance within the meaning set forth below in paragraphs(1) and (2) and meet the programmatic requirements set forth in paragraph(3). In determining whether a site has special national significance, thesite's contribution to the historical resources already represented inthe National Marine Sanctuary Program, if any, shall also be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Determination of Significance</T3>_The National Historic Landmark (NHL)Program (36 CFR Part 65), administered by the Department of the Interior,focuses attention on properties of exceptional value to the nation as awhole. It is the Federal means of weighing the national significance ofhistorical resources. Properties designated as NHLs that are not alreadylisted on the National Register of Historic Places are automatically listedthere. In addition to adding historical units to the National Park System,NHL designation is a prerequisite for determining the eligibility of historicalresources for nomination to the World Heritage List. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consistent with the Marine Research, Protection, and Sanctuaries Actdirective that the management of special marine areas complement existingregulatory authorities to the extent practicable, the criteria for nominationas a NHL shall be used as the first step in evaluating the historical,cultural, archeological or paleontological significance of a marine resource(See Table 1). Sites of national significance demonstrated by their designationas NHLs, or considered in consultation with the Department of the Interiorand other appropriate authorities as meeting the NHL criteria, shall befurther evaluated for recommendation for selection and evaluation for additionon the SEL, in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3), below. Sites withinthe jurisdiction of the United States which have international significanceas determined by the criteria for nomination to the World Heritage Listshall also be evaluated (See Table 2). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Determination of Representative Distribution</T3>_In addition to havingnational significance, a site, in order to be recommended or selected,must complement or contribute to the desired range of historical resourcesof the National Marine Sanctuary Program. Consistent with the Program'smission and goals set forth in andSection; 922.1 of the regulations, sitesrecommended or selected for historical qualities must be illustrative ofthe nation's maritime heritage and representative of the nation's mostsignificant historical marine resources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Additional Programmatic Requirements</T3>_In addition to having specialnational significance to qualify for recommendation and selection for additionto the SEL, coordinated and comprehensive conservation and management ofthe site including: (a) resource protection; (b) scientific reseach andmonitoring; and (c) public education must be necessary in order to derivemaximum present and future public benefit from the site's resources. Designationof a site as a National Marine Sanctuary must also complement existingregulatory authorities and improve the protection and preservation of thesite's resources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Additional Factors in Site Identification and Selection </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">III. Potential Activity Impacts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many marine areas are subject to human use, some of which bring adversepressures to bear on the natural resources. Where applicable, initial identificationof potential marine sanctuary areas includes a summary of existing andpotential human activities in these areas as well as a preliminary assessmentof environmental impacts. To the extent such information is available,NOAA's selection of sites for the SEL will consider impacts of human activitieson the area's natural resource and human use values, as well as the impactsof site selection on human activities already taking place within the site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">IV. Management Concerns </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Relationship to Other Programs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While some sanctuaries may be designed to protect resources not currentlymanaged by other existing programs (<T3>e.g., </T3> the <T3>U.S.S. MONITOR </T3>on the continental shelf off North Carolina), mostrecommendations involved cooperation with some other Federal, State, localagency or organization. The ability of existing regulatory mechanisms toprotect the values of the area and the contribution of the National MarineSanctuary Program to that existing management effort may be an importantfactor in selecting sanctuary candidates. Depending on the location, theresource, and the existing system, national marine sanctuary designationcould either complement the status quo by filling specific gaps or forma management umbrella over a fragmented system to help coordinate and strengthendiverse, but related efforts. At different sites, NOAA may work to complementother programs' efforts such as national estuarine research reserves, nationalparks, wildlife refuges, or state preserves, among others. There may beinstances where NOAA's primary contribution to protection of special marineareas will be in the form of enhanced public awareness through interpretiveand research programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. Management of a Conservation Unit </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Optimum size of a marine sanctuary is an issue to be considered inpotential sanctuary sites. The size or extent of a marine sanctuary shouldbe a cohesive conservation unit amenable to effective management givenfiscal and staff constraints of the managing entities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Accessibility </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since national marine sanctuaries are to be readily available forpublic use, when use is compatible with the sanctuary's goals and objectives,consideration should be given to factors which limit or enhance publicaccess to a particular site. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">D. Surveillance and Enforcement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another issue to be considered when evaluating a potential sanctuarysite is the degree to which the area lends itself to adequate enforcementand surveillance and the capabilities of responsible agents (<T3>e.g., </T3>U.S. Coast Guard, state law enforcement divisions, or thelike). This depends on the location, its size, and the types of resourcesinvolved. Consideration is also given to: (1) Degree of surveillance/enforcementpresence needed in the area_light, medium, or heavy; (2) schedule_routine,prescribed, or case-by-case basis; and (3) logistics_vessels, aircraft,personnel, equipment, and budgetary requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">E. Economic Considerations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The designation of a national marine sanctuary may have economic effectsat both local and national levels. Prior to the development of a managementplan for a particular site which describes the uses and activities whichmay take place within a sanctuary, it is difficult to calculate fully theeconomic impact of sanctuary designation. It is also difficult to determine,at the SEL stage, the economic benefits of the sanctuary to society asa whole based on such considerations as public use, and research and interpretivevalues which will also be fully described in a management plan. Sanctuarydesignation may, in some cases, enhance economic value by ensuring long-termprotection for commercially significant resources, such as commercial orrecreational fish stocks, vital habitats, and resources which generatetourism. Conversely, a designated marine sanctuary may have negative economicimpacts if management regulations unduly restrict commercial activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To the extent feasible, a decision to include a proposed site on theSEL will take into consideration the economic effects of sanctuary designation.As consideration of a particular site progresses through the designationprocess, more information will be developed and analyzed concerning theeconomic effects of sancturay designation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Table 1._National Historic Landmarks Program Selection Criteria (36CFR 65.4</ITAG>)<ITAG tagnum="21">Specific Criteria of National Significance: The quality of nationalsignificance is ascribed to districts, sites, buildings, structures andobjects that possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpretingthe heritage of the United States in history, architecture, archeology,engineering and culture and that possess a high degree of integrity oflocation, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association,and:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) That are associated with events that have made a significant contributionto, and are identified with, or that outstandingly represent, the broadnational patterns of United States history and from which an understandingand appreciation of those patterns may be gained; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) That are associated importantly with the lives of persons nationallysignificant in the history of the United States; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) That represent some great idea or ideal of the American people;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) That embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architecturaltype specimen exceptionally valuable for a study of a period, style ormethod of construction or that represent a significant, distinctive andexceptional entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) That are composed of integral parts of the environment not sufficientlysignificant by reason of historical association or artistic merit to warrantindividual recognition but collectively compose an entity of exceptionalhistorical or artistic significance, or outstandingly commemorate or illustratea way of life or culture; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) That have yielded or may be likely to yield information of majorscientific importance by revealing new cultures, or by shedding light uponperiods of occupation over large areas of the United States.
