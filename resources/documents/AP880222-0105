Swaggart tearfully told his congregation in Baton Rouge, La., onSunday that he would leave his ministry ``for an undetermined,indeterminate period of time'' because he had sinned.   Many members of the congregation gathered around Swaggart afterthe service to cry, pray and hold hands.   ``I think he's truly repentant. And I think he's set atremendous example for all of us of what true repentance isabout,'' said congregant Evelyn Murray.   Swaggart said the future of his ministry was up to the Lord andofficials of his denomination, the Assemblies of God, whoreportedly were reviewing photographs purporting to show Swaggartand a prostitute entering and leaving a motel room.   Church officials and congregants praised the candor of theevangelist, whose broadcasts reach into more than 100 countries andwhose ministry had an income estimated at $142 million in 1986.   Forest H. Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' he and his wife,Tammy, were ``kind of sick to our stomachs''over the news of Swaggart's problems and added, ``Our heart goesout to them and their family.   ``My advice to Jimmy would be don't do anything for about amonth and just pray, and then make decisions. I made a very badmistake by making decisions too quick,'' Bakker said.   Bakker resigned from his PTL ministry in March and later wasdefrocked by the Assemblies of God after admitting to a sexualencounter with Miss Hahn, a church secretary.   Mrs. Bakker said she cried when she heard about Swaggart'stroubles. ``I just felt like I didn't want anyone to suffer the wayour family has had to suffer this last year,'' she said Sunday.``We love him and we're praying for him.''   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who took over the PTL ministry for eightmonths after Bakker left, said: ``I am deeply saddened over thistragedy. With the credibility crisis in recent days involving WallStreet, the world of politics and the arena of religion, manysincere people have had their faith shattered.''   David Clark, the trustee of PTL appointed by U.S. BankruptcyCourt, said, ``It's hard to assess the impact on the so-calledelectronic church. I'm sure our telephones will tell us tomorrowwhat they're thinking.''   Miss Hahn, who accepted secret payments from PTL to cover up herencounter with Bakker, said she expected Swaggart's troubles toaffect contributors.   ``When they turn on the TV, they're going to see a preacher andwonder if this offering is paying hush money or for a prostitute... I just feel bad,'' she said.   Miss Hahn said she had heard months ago Swaggart was going to beinvolved in the current controversy, but when she learned of hispublic confession, ``I almost fell on the floor.''   ``What shocked me was that he resigned. I feel really bad aboutthis. It hit me. I think that there's too many preachers hangingvendettas over each other,'' she said in a telephone interview fromthe Playboy mansion where she lives in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
