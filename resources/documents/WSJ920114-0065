GarySick, the author of that book, claims he himself did notbelieve this story during the 1988 presidential campaign, andMr. Hosenball uncritically repeats this claim.   But -- as I showed in a May 2 article in The Wall StreetJournal -- the record shows Mr. Sick had long believed in theParis deal. For example, he told the Rocky Mountain News onOct. 30, 1988, referring to meetings between William Caseyand the Iranians in Paris: &quot;At first I dismissed this, butnot any more. I'm convinced on the basis on what I heard thatthere were some meetings in Paris.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   This is important for it sheds doubt on Mr. Sick'spresentation of himself as a dispassionate witness. Further,if he can't even give a straight account of his own thinkingthree years ago, how can we take seriously his elaboratehypothesis about U.S.-Iranian relations in 1980?
