The paperproposes a test for Evaluating the adequacy of a programming languageL for a machine M: Implement a simulator for M in L and establish thatL can be implemented on M so that the simulator executes efficiently.A language L that passes this test can be uses as a general-purpose programminglanguage for M, in the sense that any algorithm that can be implementedon M can be implemented on it efficiently in L, and any other programminglanguage L' for M can be implemented on M efficiently by embedding itin L. The test is applied to Flat Concurrent Prolog and two machine models:a RAM and a network of RAM's.</TEXT></DOC>
