He said the review began earlier this summer and is beingconducted by the fraud and public integrity sections of the criminaldivision.   Runkel rejected calls from several lawmakers that the JusticeDepartment seek court appointment of an independent counsel toinvestigate allegations of wrongdoing at HUD.   ``Investigations are proceeding in U.S. attorneys' offices aroundthe country and there is no reason to believe these cannot behandled by the U.S. attorneys,'' Runkel said. Attorney General DickThornburgh ``has made it clear he wants these cases given highpriority,'' the spokesman added.   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment andhousing has heard allegations of influence peddling during theReagan administration to obtain high-level approval of HUD financingfor development projects.   The panel has also heard conflicting testimony about the role offormer HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. in the awarding of HUDgrants to politically connected developers.   Pierce has denied allegations that he helped political friendsget HUD grants. The panel has heard testimony contradicting Pierce'sdenials and has called him back for more questioning on the matter.   The public integrity section earlier had reviewed a HUD inspectorgeneral's report that found broad instances of lobbying of top HUDofficials by developers. The prosecutors made a preliminaryconclusion that the report had uncovered no instances of wrongdoing.   HUD officials, meanwhile, asked Congress Monday to reverse acourt decision they say could cost the government more than the $2billion pricetag put on past agency abuses.   The request came at a Senate Banking Committee hearing at whichdeputies to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp also promised to permanentlyflush politics out of the selection process for HUD's abuse-riddledSection 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program.   It was the first HUD-related hearing by the Senate panel sinceCongress returned earlier this month from a month-long recess.   Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said the panel planned to callall of the major players in the Reagan-era abuses at HUD, anindication the Senate would seek to match an exhaustiveinvestigation being conducted by a House subcommittee.   During prior testimony, Kemp agreed with a congressman's $2billion ``ballpark'' estimate of the cost to taxpayers of theinflunce-peddling, fraud and mismanagement in HUD programs duringthe eight-year tenure of Pierce.   James Logue, the agency's general assistance secretary formultifamily housing, said a recent decision by the Ninth CircuitCourt of Appeals in San Francisco could cost HUD $2.5 billion overthe next decade unless Congress amends housing laws.   The court rejected HUD's formula for granting rent increases toSection 8 projects, saying the agency cannot use rent-comparabilitystudies to determine how much owners of subsidized apartments canraise rents.   Logue said the ruling would cost HUD $150 million in the circuitcourt's nine-state jurisdiction and if applied nationwide could costfrom $600 million to $1 billion in retroactive rent adjustments andanother $1.5 billion over the next 10 years.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the panel would consider therequest and asked Logue to provide more information on the ruling.   The moderate rehabilitation program was the subject of a scathingreport earlier this year in which HUD's inspector general said thatlucrative subsidies were awarded to former HUD officials or otherdevelopers who retained prominent Republican consultants.   Much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision torepeal a ``fair share'' formula through which the subsidies wereawarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need forthe low-income housing and the ability to administer the program.   HUD officials took over most of the funding decisions afterCongress repealed the formula.   Kemp, however, voluntarily decided to revert to using the ``fairshare'' approach and his deputies said the department would continuethat if the program is funded next year.   The inspector general also found that many moderaterehabilitation projects were approved at excessive rents, costingthe government hundreds of millions of dollars over the 15-yearsubsidy contracts.   Logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in thebeginning of the new fiscal year which begins Oct. 1 and HUD wouldmove to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriatelycalculated.</TEXT></DOC>
