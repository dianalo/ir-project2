(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The husband and wife team that led Stopandamp; Shop Cos. were forced out of the company after more than 30years, sources say, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., whichacquired the company in a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout.   The company announced Monday that Avram J. Goldberg resigned aschairman and chief executive officer, and his wife Carol RabbGoldberg, daughter of company founder, Sidney Rabb, resigned aspresident and chief operating officer.   The Goldbergs led the sale of the company 18 months ago toKohlberg Kravis Roberts, a New York leveraged buyout specialist, toblock a hostile takeover attempt by Herbert Haft of Maryland, whobid $4.6 billion for the company.   ``I was shocked,'' said Stephen Griffin, executive vicepresident of the Griffin Report of Weymouth, Mass., which tracksfood companies.   ``They continue to open new stores, and everything seemed to befine,'' he said of the Goldbergs resigning. ``The surprise is theabruptness and immediacy of it.''   Lewis G. Shaeneman Jr., who has been with Stop andamp; Shop for 22years and has been president and chief executive officer of thesupermarket division since 1980, was named the new chairman.   Robert G. Tobin, executive vice president and chief operatingofficer of the supermarket division, was appointed the newpresident.   The Goldbergs, whose salaries totaled more than $1 million lastyear, own 1.15 percent of the newly formed private company.   The Boston Globe quoted an unidentified source as saying that``Henry Kravis never liked Avram and Carol.''   ``He always thought they were running it more like family andnot as professional managers. The business never should have beensold to KKR. It was a terrible mistake,'' the source said.   ``This is the busy season, and KKR wants leadership thatleads,'' another unnamed source told the Boston Herald.   That newspaper also quoted sources saying there had been growingfriction between the Goldbergs and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and thatthe investor group decided to oust the Goldbergs and put inmanagers who would ``do things the way KKR wanted to do them.''   Tom Daly, a spokesman for KKR in New York, said Kohlberg KravisRoberts had no comment on the allegations.   The changes come in the midst of the 75th anniversary observanceof the company, the largest supermarket chain in New England.   The supermarket division has 116 stores in New England and NewYork. Its Bradlees division has 131 discount department stores ineight states.   The supermarket division reportedly took in 17.5 percent of themoney spent on food in New England last year, compared with 16percent the previous year.   The Bradlees division, however, sold its 35 stores in the deepSouth.   The company lost $21 million last year, largely because of thebuyout cost, on sales of $4.6 billion. Operating profit was $160million compared with $117 million in 1987.   Sidney Rabb founded the company in 1914, and family managementcontinued long after the company went public in 1923.   The company was known for its community activism andphilanthropy. It endowed chairs at Harvard University and HarvardBusiness School and is observing the anniversary by giving $3million in computer equipmernt to elementary schools in New England.</TEXT></DOC>
