More than 800 dead and dying bottlenose dolphins, many with skinlesions, washed ashore from New Jersey southward to Floridabeginning in June 1987. The last dead dolphin was spotted in Floridain February.   Researchers originally suspected a virus or bacteria, but are nowconcentrating on toxins that could have poisoned the marine mammals,said Dr. Joseph Geraci, professor of wildlife diseases at theOntario College of Veterinarian Medicine in Guelph, Canada. Hepresented a report on his investigation at an Oceans '88 conferencehere.   He expects final conclusions in about six weeks.   Geraci said that while high levels of pollutants and variousviruses were found in the dead dolphins' tissue, neither appears tohave killed them.   ``(We) suspect that we are dealing with a point source, somethingat sea that might have been a natural toxin or some otherpollutant,'' Geraci said.   He said all the dolphins appear to have been poisoned in earlysummer 1987.   ``Some died right away, some lived long enough to become infectedwith bacterias. Those animals languished for as long as six, eightmonths after the initial event,'' he said.   Most industrial pollutants have been tentatively ruled out andscientists are concentrating on natural poisons, Geraci said. Onebattery of tests for biological toxins found nothing but tests arecontinuing, he said.   The events that led to a rare red tide along the East Coast,although not the red tide itself, may be to blame, the Canadianscientist said.   Red tides occur when microscopic algae become so populous thatthe water appears stained red. In great concentrations they releasetoxins that are deadly to some fish. And once in the food chain, thetoxins can harm other creatures, including man.   While common on the west coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico,red tides are almost unheard of on the East Coast, although in 1987a red tide spread as far as North Carolina, killing shellfish there,Geraci said.   ``However, that event occurred in the first part of November,whereas the dolphins were dying as early as June,'' he said.   ``There may have been events that spawned this red tide on theEast Coast that were also associated with the mortality of thedolphins,'' Geraci said. He declined to elaborate, saying that couldcompromise the objectivity of the investigation.   Warm water, calm seas, high nutrient levels, low salinity andrainy periods followed by sunny weather are some of the factors thatcontribute to red tides.   ``The pattern of mortality, the extended time when it took place,the geographic range: all lead us to suspect that we are dealingwith an agent or condition which these animals might have contactedat about the same time in early summer of '87,'' Geraci said.</TEXT></DOC>
