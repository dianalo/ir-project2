The design of track links is shown in diagrams. Links are weldedfrom sheet metal. Vertical reinforcement plates are positioned in thelink interior to limit bending of the bottom metal sheet. Three variantsof load impact on links are outlined: regular operation with full linksupport on the ground; wheel load on a link with partial link contactwith the ground; and wheel load on a link with link standing in inclinedposition on a stone, which keeps the link from full contact with theground surface. In order to determine fatigue strength and static stresses,wheel load and link endurance value are required. The wheel load hasto be determined according to formulae provided by the TGL 13472 standard;the endurance value is given in VBK 0052, taking equipment service lifeand mean annual driving distances into account. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
