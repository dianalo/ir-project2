The Merc charged that the brokers prearranged trades tocircumvent limits on trades among members of the same broker group.The violations occurred in the pit where futures contracts aretraded on Eurodollars, attorney Jeffrey Cole said today.   Richard Lowrance, who resigned from the exchange's board ofgovernors last month, was fined $200,000 and suspended for 30 days,Cole said. Lowrance stepped down before an appearance before theMerc disciplinary committee in the case.   David Rothner received a $75,000 fine and a 10-day suspension.Patrick Maloney was fined $25,000 and barred from trading for fivedays. Floor trader Brian Elliott, who was accused of serving an anintermediary in the violations, was fined $100,000 and suspended 30days, according to Cole.   The penalties were imposed in an agreement reached late Tuesdayunder which the brokers neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.   Broker groups are teams of floor traders who fill public orders.They are legal, but have come under scrutiny by an FBI investigationinto suspected fraudulent trading at the Merc and Cgation, he said.   ``There is no doubt the fines were as high as they were becauseof the climate in which traders currently find themselves because ofthe federal investigation,'' Cole said.   Last June, Maloney was fined $1,000 for exceeding limitations oncustomer order filling in Eurodollar futures. Rothner was fined$1,000 for a similar violation in Eurodollar contracts in April 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
