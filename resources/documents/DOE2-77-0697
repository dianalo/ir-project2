<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0697 </DOCNO><TEXT>We provide a classification of lattice rules. Applying elementary grouptheory, we assign to each s-dimensional lattice rule a rank m and a setof positive integer invariants n{sub 1} n{sub 2}....,n/sub s/. The number{nu}(Q) of abscissas required by the rule is the product n{sub 1}n{sub2}...n/sub s/, and the rule may be expressed in a canonical form withm independent summations. Under this classification an N-point number-theoreticrule in the sense of Korobov and Conroy is a rank m = 1 rule having invariantsN, 1,1,...,1, and the product trapezoidal rule using n/sup s/ pointsin rank m = s rule having invariants n,n...,n. Besides providing a canonicalform, we give some of the properties of copy rules and of projectionsinto lower dimensions.</TEXT></DOC>
