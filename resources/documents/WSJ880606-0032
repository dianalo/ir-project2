Toronto-based Rogers recently retained Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. to find a buyer for its U.S. cable systems. Morgan Stanley declined to discuss bidders, but said preliminary bids for the systems, which serve 525,000 subscribers in five urban areas, are due tomorrow.    Among the companies that have already expressed interest in the systems, and may submit bids alone or in joint ventures with others, are Time Inc., which currently controls the nation's second-largest cable operator, and Toronto publisher Maclean Hunter Ltd.    Some in the industry regard United Artists as the most likely buyer for the systems. Stewart Blair, chairman and chief executive officer of United Artists, said in a telephone interview: &quot;It's a great group of systems and we are definitely interested.&quot; Mr. Blair declined to elaborate. Denver-based United Artists, one of the nation's largest cable companies and the leading operator of motion-picture theaters, is 65%-owned by the nation's largest cable company, Tele-Communications Inc., also based in Denver.    The industry executives said Pacific Bell Telephone, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, also may bid for Rogers, either alone or in a joint venture with a cable concern. Pacific Telephone officials declined to comment. But the company's chairman, Sam L. Ginn, told shareholders at the annual meeting recently that the company is seriously looking at entering the cable business.    Under terms of the consent decree that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Pacific Bell and other Bell operating companies are barred from operating cable systems in their service areas, but they may be allowed to operate cable systems outside those areas.    Pacific Bell appears to have been quietly testing the waters in cable for some time. John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, told analysts last month that Pacific Bell was the second-highest bidder for Storer Cable Inc., which Tele-Communications acquired in a partnership with Comcast Corp. two months ago. At the time, Pacific Bell denied it had made any formal bid. </TEXT></DOC>
