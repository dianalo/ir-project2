A mechanical description of the orbiting source anda description of the electronics used to discard scattered and accidentalevents is included. Since accidental coincidences were the rate-limitingfactor in transmission data acquisition, the new method allows us toacquire sufficient transmission data in a shorter time with a more activetransmission source.</TEXT></DOC>
