(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The AK-47 bullets that blasted away hisleft knee and right elbow also ended Mike Campbell's comfortabledetachment from the struggle over gun control.   ``I've never been much of an activist,'' said Campbell, one of adozen survivors of Joseph Wesbecker's rampage at the StandardGravure Corp. printing plant. ``Obviously I am for gun controlnow.''   The ability of a mentally ill man bent on revenge to legally buya military-style, semi-automatic rifle has made his wife, Betty,even more partisan.   She has special contempt for legislators she sees ascomplicitous to the extent they permit traffic in such guns and forpeople who think ``that their right to carry a gun supersedes myhusband's right to carry his grandson.''   The National Rifle Association is strong in Kentucky, where thehunting is good and freedom of arms is cherished.   But fallout from the Sept. 14 Standard Gravure shootings, inwhich eight people died, may put the NRA on the defensive for thefirst time in memory when the Kentucky General Assembly convenes inJanuary.   Mrs. Campbell looks toward the session and the likelihood oflegislation to ban or limit the sale of ``assault'' weapons. ``I amnot a public speaker but I will support, in any way I can,legislation to ban those kinds of weapons.''   The NRA, which regularly fights such legislation as aninfringement on the Second Amendment right of citizens to ``keepand bear arms,'' will be ready.   The organization says that nothing _ not a waiting period, not aban on specific weapons _ would have prevented Wesbecker's missionof vengeance against the company that ended his job because of hismental illness.   ``I think what's the real tragedy is that we use incidents likethis to propose restrictions on law-abiding citizens that will haveno effect on incidents in the future,'' said James T. Hayes, an NRAlobbyist.   ``How in a free society do you keep people like that man fromacquiring a firearm? I don't know what the answer is to that,''Hayes said.   A number of state officials now say they have an answer:restrictions on assault weapons.   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, long an opponent of gun control,endorsed assault-weapon restrictions in the days after themassacre. Two state lawmakers from the Louisville area said theyare ready to sponsor the legislation.   U.S. Rep. Carroll Hubbard, a conservative Kentucky Democrat andNRA ally, agreed four days after the shootings to become aco-sponsor of legislation in Congress that would ban the domesticmanufacture of assault weapons.   Wesbecker, 47, had an abundance of demons: two broken marriagesand a belief he had been injured by workplace chemicals and wrongedby Standard Gravure, which prints newspaper supplements andadvertising inserts.   He had been placed on permanent disability leave because ofmental illness in 1988. It was shortly before a morning shiftchange when he returned to the plant to say a gruesome good-bye.   Besides the AK-47, which can shoot 40 bullets a minute,Wesbecker had two MAC-11 semi-automatic machine pistols, a 9mmsemi-automatic pistol, a .38-caliber revolver, a bayonet andhundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to police.   He carried the AK-47, the SIG-Sauer 9mm and extra ammo. The restwas stashed in a gym bag under a stairwell. Police said Wesbecker,having shot 20 people, apparently was heading for the arms cachewhen he stopped, put the pistol under his chin and squeezed thetrigger.   His shots killed eight others.   Among the survivors, Mike Campbell, a tennis player who at 51could easily pass for 40, was luckier than most, though grievouslywounded in both arms and both legs. His left knee was pulverized.   As the couple's five daughters arrived one by one at thehospital, and collapsed one by one in horror, Betty Campbell's furywelled. ``I promised myself: `I am going to do something aboutthis.'''   A day later, she faced reporters and television cameras for thefirst time, eldest daughter Mary Campbell Ford in tears beside her,and bristled.   ``You see the devastation?'' she said. ``And anybody who thinksa private citizen needs an assault gun, please justify it to thischild, to my husband and to his grandchild. You will not justify itto me.''   After 13 days in the hospital, Mike Campbell went home to thehouse he and Betty have rehabilitated over 10 years. A hospital bedawaited in the living room, as did an electric wheelchair and a newcordless telephone.   Doctors say the best Campbell can hope for is to walk with acane within the next three years. Then, Campbell said, doctors willassess the amount of regrowth to bones in his knee; if there isenough he might be a candidate for an operation that would allowhim to walk nearly normally.   For now, Betty Campbell said Mike will be able to sit in thegazebo, his favorite place, and watch the falling leaves of autumn,his favorite time of year.   She will be watching the legislature.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
