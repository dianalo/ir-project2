Thisdissertation attempts to examine his Star Wars commitment. The hypothesisof this dissertation is the Star Wars would rather enhance the probabilityof confrontation between the two superpowers. The hypothesis is assessedby several criteria: technological feasibility; compatibility with theABM treaty; Soviet responses to the SDI program; implications for deterrenceand arms control prospects; and implications for the security of NATOEurope. SDI's technological feasibility is very questionable, given thatits defensive mission is not only to intercept all incoming warheads,but to overcome Soviet countermeasures and to survive ASAT attacks. SDI'simplications for the security of NATO Europe are further negative. WhileSDI might be an attractive option to address the security dilemma derivingfrom NATO's conventional inferiority vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact, it wouldenhance the probability of Soviet preemption, in light of the Sovietperception that the Pershing II deployment combined with SDI constitutesa US first-strike posture. The Star Wars defense would not make the worldmuch safer and more peaceful, as promised, but rather render internationalpeace and security more precarious and destabilized by increased mutualdistrust, suspicion and risk of nuclear war.</TEXT></DOC>
