(Lilco) an $83 million rate increase. His article is wrong on a number of counts.    I find it amusing that Mr. Melloan actually would contend that the center of the anti-Shoreham movement is made up of &quot;people who might show up at any rally of the American left, whether on behalf of disarmament or Nicaraguan Marxists.&quot; The fact is that almost 80% of the residents of Long Island oppose Shoreham. Many of the leading opponents include Republican and Conservative lawmakers, Long Island's two county executives as well as Gov. Cuomo and Attorney General Abrams. Furthermore, while some opponents of Shoreham oppose all nuclear-power plants, many leaders in the anti-Shoreham movement object only to this plant because of its geographic positioning. Gov. Cuomo has said that he opposes the commercial operation of Shoreham because the federal evacuation requirement cannot be met.    Mr. Melloan also criticizes Albany for not taking responsibility in providing an alternative power source for Shoreham. While Gov. Cuomo and his administration always have been willing to work with Lilco on providing an adequate supply of energy for Long Island, it is simply not the state's job to supply electricity to the people of Long Island. Considering the fact that Lilco has known for the past five to seven years that Shoreham might not operate, one might question why Lilco itself hasn't taken the time to develop alternative energy sources.    The article talks about the recent Public Service Commission decision to deny Lilco its $83 million rate increase. What it fails to mention, however, is that the PSC previously had given Lilco more than $300 million in extraordinary rate relief to allow it to pursue an operating license for the Shoreham plant. One might conclude from the PSC's most recent decision that the commission finally has recognized the futility of continuing to throw ratepayer money away in pursuit of a nuclear plant that never will operate.    The column ignores the fact that almost one-third of the cost of Shoreham has been disallowed because of pervasive mismanagement by Lilco. Many of the delays were due solely to this mismanagement.    The Shoreham issue is one that relates to the protection of the health and safety of the people of Long Island. Gov. Cuomo's actions in opposing the opening of Shoreham ignore economic expediency and instead recognize the need to protect the lives of all New Yorkers.    Richard M.
