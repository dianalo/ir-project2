Parren Mitchell and a U.S. Postal Service employee were indicted by a federal grand jury in Baltimore on charges of accepting $130,000 in bribes from officials of Wedtech Corp.    U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox said Michael B. Mitchell, a former state senator, and his brother, Clarence Mitchell III, a state senator and former Baltimore city councilman, were charged with accepting $110,000 in bribes from Wedtech to obstruct an investigation of the New York defense contractor. The two men were accused of conspiring to influence their uncle, Parren Mitchell, who oversaw the Small Business Administration investigation of Wedtech.    The indictments are the latest in a widening scandal allegedly linking Wedtech to payments to public officials. Four former officers of the company have recently pleaded guilty to bribery, grand larceny and fraud and are cooperating with the government. Earlier this week, Stanley Simon, the former president of New York City's Bronx borough, was indicted on extortion and perjury charges in the Wedtech case.    Wedtech was once a highflier on Wall Street. Its rapid growth was fueled by no-bid defense contracts available to minority-controlled businesses. But Wedtech filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors late last year, after it lost its status as a minority business and federal and state investigators began looking into allegations that Wedtech officials made political payoffs to win the no-bid contracts.    Mr. Willcox said Mr. Mitchell, the former congressman, wasn't implicated in the alleged scheme, and called him &quot;an unwitting victim.&quot;    Also indicted was Jerrydoe E. Smith, a U.S. Postal Service contracting officer, who allegedly received $20,000 from Wedtech in return for $8.6 million in contracts to make mobile containers for transporting mail.    Mr. Willcox said some Wedtech officials cooperated with the investigation. But he said his office later will charge other former company officials for their participation in the alleged bribery schemes, which are said to have taken place between 1984 and 1986.    The managing partner of the Mitchell law firm, where Michael and Clarence Mitchell work, said the two men declined to comment on the charges. A woman who answered the telephone at Mr. Smith's home said, &quot;we have no comment&quot; and hung up.    If convicted, Clarence Mitchell could face as many as 20 years in prison, and Michael Mitchell could receive a maximum prison term of 25 years. Mr. Smith could be sentenced to as many as 15 years if convicted.    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Michael B. Mitchell&quot; -- WSJ April 6, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
