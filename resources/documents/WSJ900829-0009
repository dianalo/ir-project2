The Bush policyis beginning to have the feel of something vulnerable.Congress hasn't yet returned to its roost, but the sky isdotted with the sort of circling opinion that appearswhenever the political establishment senses a President'spolicy might stumble. Even among the President's supporters,various doubts and questions are starting to materialize.   The most prominent, centering around what might be calledthe Kissinger-Haig school, is that Mr. Bush needs to initiatea pre-emptive strike against Iraq now, before the Americanpeople wimp out. We would support such a strike, but theidea's underlying premise bothers us: Underestimating theAmerican people was precisely what was wrong withNixon-Administration foreign policy. The American people willsupport what makes sense. Somehow in modern, media-obsessedWashington, this basic truth gets lost when Administrationofficials start sweating over whether they're playing well onthe evening news shows.</LP><TEXT>   In the crucial area of public support, Mr. Bush continuesto hold a strong hand, and not merely because the latestopinion polls are showing good numbers. We in fact havesomething else in this country on which to base mandates forpresidential policies. They're called presidential elections.As for many of the others doubting what the American peoplewill support, we wonder whether they voted with the majorityin the Reagan-Bush landslides. The fact remains that supportfor Vietnam and Korea eroded not because of casualties, butbecause of uncertain purposes. Again, with no superpowerbacking Saddam, that becomes the case with Iraq only if theAdministration makes it so.   So far Mr. Bush is doing well without bloodshed; thecrucial test is what the end game will be. In terms oflessons for the future, what justifies the efforts we haveundertaken?   Mr. Bush said forcefully several times Monday that hewants Iraq out of Kuwait. That's fine, but is merely gettingSaddam to trundle back across the border really what thiswhole thing is about? Earlier, in announcing that U.S. troopswere going to the Gulf, the policy goal was &quot;defensive&quot; -- toprotect the Saudi oil fields. Then in a speech Mr. Bushtalked about world order. All worthy goals, but they've beendribbled out separately, almost depending in recent days onwhat questions float up from the press pool in Kennebunkport.   Perhaps the question of public goals becomes clearer if weset the range of alternatives against each other. If the goalis that Saddam backs down but keeps his military machine,that is simply not enough. If Saddam stays in office, iskilled in six months and the Baath Party and its militarymachine stay in place, that's at best a gentleman's C. IfSaddam is overthrown, his successors are willing to negotiatearms reduction and we keep a base in Kuwait and cooperate ina democratic evolution there, that's a solid A-minus. If wetake Baghdad and install a MacArthur regency, that is theoptimum.   At the moment, the Bush Administration seems satisfied tosay that its policy is Iraq's departure from Kuwait. Again,this quite modest goal isn't likely to sustain a politicalconsensus for long and will breed uncertainty among thepublic. Saddam-out-of-Kuwait is an end point that is veryvulnerable to substantive criticism.   Both the policy elites and the general public arewell-informed by now as to what the current Iraqi regime isabout -- aggressive expansionism backed up by a massivemilitary structure, a history of using chemical weapons, anda serious effort to build nuclear and biological weapons. Thepublic also knows that Iran endured hundreds of thousands ofdead to merely keep Saddam on his side of the border. Now heis in Kuwait. His grand announcement that he will let foreignwomen and children leave Iraq, while presumably retaining hismale &quot;guests,&quot; is only the latest demonstration of hiscynicism.   This presidency is demonstrably skilled at working thepolitical equation, meeting yesterday with 150 Members ofCongress to discuss the situation in the Gulf. But the momentdoubts pervade the American public, Mr. Bush will be severalyards out onto the same thin ice occupied by some of hispredecessors. The Gulf intervention is important. Thepublic's support will weather the more difficult days to comeif it is told clearly and directly what our goals are.</TEXT></DOC>
