Although L-LDPE has superior potential performance as the laminatingmaterial, there is a drawback to the processability. The direct laminationtechnology and the resin grades suitable for the laminate were developedto improve the drawback. The grades to be developed were the resin alternativeto LDPE, that suitable for low-temperature heat sealing and automaticpacking and that suitable for heat resistance and moisture proofness.The low-temperature direct lamination technology at a temperature lowerthan the resin temperature of 300{sup 0}C was developed to keep the adhesionand sealing characteristics. Grades for the double applying method todirectly laminate at a lower temperature than for LDPE, and for laminatingon paper such as kraft paper and high-grade paper under the same conditionsas for LDPE.
