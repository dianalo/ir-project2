From a wooden platform nearby, visitors peering over the grimconcrete barricade could see what had become of the square thatonce was the vibrant city center _ the Times Square or PicadillyCircus of central Europe.   A vast death strip dotted with concrete watchtowers had replacedthe cafes where playwright Bertolt Brecht caroused in the 1920s.   Where bustling Berliners once traded and changed trams, therewas only an eerie emptiness and silence.   On Sunday, the silence and some of the ghostly atmosphere liftedas East German soldiers removed enough slabs from either side ofthe no-man's-land to allow the mayors of East and West Berlin, andthen thousands of their citizens, to meet.   For the first time since the wall blocked them 28 years ago, thetram lines could be seen in full, running through into East Berlinon a cobbled street that survived both Adolf Hitler's war and theensuing Cold War.   ``Perhaps,'' mused an East Berlin woman wistfully as she waitedin the gray mist to cross to the West, ``perhaps there'll be a tramline running here again soon.''   Only a week ago, that was inconceivable.   ``We want to look through the Brandenburg Gate from the otherside,'' said East Berliner Wolfgang Rosenloecher, standing with hiswife Monika.   ``Just last week, we were walking there, saying to ourselvesperhaps we'll get there before we are pensioners. But we neverthought it would happen so quickly.''   Rosenloecher, 62, came here many times between 1951 and 1961,when the wall was built. ``This was where the drivers of the tramschanged, between the Western and Eastern zones. Over there,'' hepointed into the no-man's-land on either side of the wall, ``thatwas the market where the easterners could buy stuff in theircurrency.''   ``And of course,'' he sighed, ``Potsdamer Platz was one of theplaces where the most happened on June 17.''   On that day in 1953, Soviet tanks rumbled over the cobblestonesto crush a workers' revolt against East Germany's Communistgovernment.   On Sunday, such cruel memories were in the past.   East Berlin's mayor Erhard Krack walked past the dismemberedslabs of the wall into West Berlin and shook hands with his WestBerlin counterpart, Wolfgang Momper.   In contrast to the quiet, orderly crowd of about 1,000 on theeastern side, the 10,000 or so in West Berlin were in noisy highspirits.   ``Let us in! We want to go and have breakfast on the Alex!''they cried, referring to the Alexanderplatz square in downtown EastBerlin.   Hundreds climbed the wall and swarmed into the former deathstrip. Watched by bemused East German border guards, a long-haired``rocker'' dressed in black leather careened around, shouting ``Ican't believe it! The Wall has gone!''   Hundreds of impatient easterners left to seek another lesscrowded crossing.   Rosenloecher and his wife didn't budge. ``We used to use everyopportunity we could to look across to the West, climbing the highapartment houses ... or to the top of the cathedral,'' said Mrs.Rosenloecher. ``We can wait now.''</TEXT></DOC>
