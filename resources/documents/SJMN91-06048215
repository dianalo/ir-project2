Who'll pay. And actually building the thing.;    Toward that end,the county transit agency has been peppering neighborhoods with pamphlets,holding community meetings on proposed routes and generally fueling BARTeuphoria among residents longing to feel connected to the rest of the BayArea.;    But even with all the pumping, figure on another 10 to 20 yearsbefore BART actually comes trundling this way.;    Politicians' fault;  &quot;Thepeople are ready,&quot; said San Jose City Councilman Jim Beall, who sits on thecommittee that is studying BART-to-San Jose. &quot;It's the politicians who areslowing things down.&quot;;    It was in 1985 that politicians started bickeringover what route BART should take into San Jose. It'll be winter before it'sresolved.;    By 1987, the group of elected officials studying the route -- agroup that includes county supervisors Rod Diridon, who spearheaded theeffort, and Zoe Lofgren -- decided the most cost-effective route would runalong the old Southern-Pacific right of way, a line that runs several mileseast of Interstate 880, through Milpitas, past Starlight Pines and industrialnorth San Jose, through Japantown and the Hensley Historic District, then upto Santa Clara.;    But soon after the line was chosen, federal officials sentword that ridership estimates didn't meet their funding standards -- they wantto pay $6 to $10 per new rider, and the line would cost closer to $28 perhead. Since it's tough to fund a $1.5 billion project without federal help,they advised the county to drop the whole thing.;    Election year;  ButDiridon and Lofgren decided to take a gamble. It was an election year, afterall, maybe there would be a change in administrations in Washington -- or atleast a change in attitude. They pushed for a state environmental analysis andright-of-way purchases.;    But when the elections were over, what they gotwas Ron Gonzales.;    Within his first 100 days as a county supervisor,Gonzales demanded a new analysis of the corridor alternatives, contending thatthe committee had no good reason for rejecting a route that lies three milescloser to the East San Jose neighborhoods he represents.;    That line runsalong old Union Pacific right of way, edging Berryessa, Little Portugal,Little Saigon and San Jose State before heading up to Santa Clara.;    Backedby the cities of San Jose and Milpitas, he forced the committee into a newstudy. It should have taken six months. Two years and $400,000 later, it dragson.;    'An emotional issue';  Lofgren maintains the issue was decided andshould have stayed that way, that Gonzales' route is more expensive, takesmore homes and, for all the hubbub, doesn't really go through East San Jose.;   &quot;It's an emotional issue -- bring BART to East San Jose -- then you look andit doesn't go to East San Jose,&quot; she said. &quot;I hate to say I told you so, butre-studying it has turned out to be a real bad idea.&quot;;    For his part,Gonzales argues that the Union Pacific option would serve more people --particularly Hispanics, a group that has felt left out of San Jose's costlycomeback -- and that disrupting more homes is the price for servicingneighborhoods rather than businesses.;    Cost analysis;  Until recently,momentum sided with Lofgren. Initial studies showed the Union Pacific line tobe more expensive ($1.7 billion compared to $1.43 billion), more costly pernew rider ($32 a head, compared to $28) and to serve only 800-some more ridersper day.;    Then, at Gonzales' request, the consultant reworked the numbersto reflect modifications in the Union Pacific line. The new figures showed theroute costing only $150 million more than SP, costing only a dollar more pernew head, while serving 834 more riders per day.;    Meanwhile, a whole otherset of negotiations wears on.;    By law, to become a voting member of BART, acounty has to pay &quot;a fair share&quot; of what San Francisco, Alameda and ContraCosta counties have paid over the years to build the system.;    In today'sdollars, said BART director Nello Bianco, the system would be worth $10billion -- meaning Santa Clara County's buy-in share would be $2.5 billion.;   Bianco admits that's out of the question, but wants Santa Clara County toante up $800 million to $900 million. Anything less, he said, and Santa Clarashould not be given voting rights even if it pays for a line -- a positionDiridon, who's in on the negotiations, finds unacceptable.;    Warm Springsextension;  Another issue in the deadlock is Bianco's insistence that SantaClara County help pay for the Fremont to Warm Springs extension in AlamedaCounty since, he maintains, its real purpose is to position the line to crossthe border.;    Santa Clara County officials have refused, saying theyshouldn't be held responsible for Warm Springs and, in any event, don't havethe money for such a venture.;    Assuming the two sides do work out a deal,there remains the question of how to pay for it. Those involved innegotiations agree it will require a new half-cent sales tax, to take effectwhen the current half-cent tax sunsets in 1994. Voters passed that tax in 1984to fund highway expansions.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTEDThere will be a communitymeeting on the proposed BART routes at 7 p.m. Feb. 28 at the County Building,70 W.
