Police Commissioner Willie Williams called the latestindictments ``another sad day for the Philadelphia policedepartment'' and said he is continuing efforts to root outcorruption. But he added that the corruption involves ``only a verysmall and insignificant number'' of officers.   ``For police officers to take money or other property inexchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to deal drugs or forthe officers to take and to distribute drugs themselves, that makesother forms of official corruption pale in comparison,'' saidacting U.S. Attorney Thomas Lee II.   Lee spoke at a news conference, where one of the indicted men,former Lt. John Wilson, burst in to proclaim his innocence, saying,``I was investigated for seven years.'' FBI agents forcibly ejectedhim.   Since a federal inquiry into official corruption here begannearly a decade ago, about 40 city police officers have beenconvicted, mostly for protecting illegal gambling.   Six of the officers indicted Tuesday are no longer members ofPhiladelphia's 7,000-member police department and the seventh, whohad remained on th force but not in a narcotics squad, wassuspended and given a dismissal notification, Williams said.   Two others who were not police officers were also charged, onewith conspiracy to distribute cocaine the police obtained in anarcotics search, and the other with failing to pay income taxes ondrug profits.   The indictment alleges the racketeering activity occurredbetween January 1980 and February 1984 when at least 65 narcoticssearches were conducted by officers assigned to a special drugsquad that has since been disbanded.   The indictment charged Wilson, Ronald Giongo, David Grove, JamesCattalo, Richard Jumper and Francis Hilt with obtaining money andother property, including drugs, for their personal gain bystealing, threats and intimidation, Lee said.   This pattern of activity falls under federal racketeering laws,Lee said, enabling the indictment to seek forfeiture to thegovernment of about $400,000 in proceeds. Racketeering also carriesa maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.   Besides the racketeering charge, Grove and Cattalo are accusedof distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaineand methamphetamine. Grove, Cattalo, Wilson and Hilt are chargedwith conspiracy to obstruct justice.   Another ex-member of the special drug squad, Charles Hund, andcivilian Scott Karasinksi were charged with conspiracy todistribute cocaine, while Karasinksi also was charged with failureto file a tax return. Civilian Donald Crawford was charged with twocounts of income tax evasion.</TEXT></DOC>
