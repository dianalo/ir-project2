Last week, the board of the Allied Pilots Associationrejected the airline's final offer by a vote of 20-0. TheAPA, which represents 8,800 pilots at the airline, listednine reasons for rejecting the proposal, chiefly American'sproposed pay levels, medical benefits and work rule changes.The two sides are said to be several hundred million dollarsapart in their positions.</LP><TEXT>   The APA's veto moves the two sides closer to a strike, andboth sides have been making preparation for one. But bybringing the two sides back to the bargaining table, theNational Mediation Board, the federal agency that overseesairline labor relations, signaled its intention to push for anegotiated settlement. It's unclear how long the NMB willkeep the two sides talking.   The pilots and the AMR Corp. unit have been discussing anew contract for 16 months, since before their last contractexpired at the end of 1989. Under airline labor law, the oldcontract stays in effect until a new contract is worked out,or until federal mediators decide the two sides have reachedan impasse. After that, it's up to the NMB to set a 30-daycountdown clock, after which the company can impose its owncontract and the union is free to strike.</TEXT></DOC>
