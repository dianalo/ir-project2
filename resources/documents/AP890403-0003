The fighting began after members of the elite Leopards Battalionoccupied the airport. Several of them roamed the capital, shootingin the air and shouting: ``Get off the streets, the city belongs tous.''   Residents stayed home, and businesses and schools were closed.Streets were littered with burning tires, but it was not known whoset them on fire.   The Leopards took over the government television and radiostations at 3:30 p.m. and halted broadcasts.   The shooting between guardsmen and Leopards broke out Mondayafternoon, when the two sides confronted each other driving onDelmas Road, a main commercial throughfare in the capital.   Radio stations gave varying reports on casualties, from four toeight killed and eight wounded. The reports could not be confirmed.   Radio Metropole, an independent station, said 300 demonstratorssupporting the Leopards paraded down Delmas Road shoutinganti-government slogans, demanding Avril resign and erectingbarricades of flaming tires.   In the afternoon, several Leopards made three demands over theindependent radio station Haiti-Inter. They said they want allegedcoup leader Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu released, a civilian governmentto replace Avril, and the complete restoration of the 1987constitution, which was suspended last June.   The constitution has 37 articles which mostly limit the role ofthe army.   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the rebels occupiedHaiti's international airport, which remained closed.   ``Everything is calm except for the Leopards,'' she said. ``Theysay they want Rebu released, and that's the standoff.''   The Leopards were created in the 1960s by ousted dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier and are the best trained and most professionalin the military. As opposed to others in the 7,000-man army, theLeopards have not been associated with human rights violations.   Sources have said Rebu and the other three led the attemptSunday to overthrow Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the military ruler putin office by a coup six months ago.   Avril's government removed Rebu from command of the Leopards andput him under military guard at an undisclosed location. The fatesof the other three alleged coup leaders were not known.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid: ``We are pleased that President Avril's authority has beenrestored. U.S. policy objectives for Haiti remain the promotion ofdemocratic reform, respect for human rights, credible economicdevelopment programs and cooperation on narcotics issues.   ``President Avril has made significant progress on this agendain the last six months and the United States government willcontinue to support his efforts as the process moves forward.''   Loyal soldiers in tanks rescued Avril as he was being driven tothe airport Sunday night, in handcuffs, to be flown into exile. Itwould have been the impoverished Caribbean nation's third coup inless than a year.   He made a televised speech soon after midnight, flanked bysoldiers in battle gear, but gave no details of the coup attempt.He blamed it on ``some members of the army forces, blinded by theirexorbitant ambitions,'' but said he still had ``faith in the army.''   How many of the battalion's 300 members were involved in themutiny Monday was not known.   Motives for Sunday's coup remained unclear, but it appearedlinked to the arrest last week of four ranking army officers whohave been accused of drug trafficking.   Fritz Longchamp, director of the Washington Office on Haitiresearch group, said by telephone that rumors had circulated in themilitary that Avril had a long list of officers to be fired in acrackdown on narcotics and corruption.   He said four of those were rumored to be the coup leaders: Rebu;Col. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines Barracks behind thepresidential palace; Col. Phillipe Biambey, commander of the PalaceGuard, and Col. George Valcin, police chief of Port-au-Prince.   Longchamp said the coup attempt ended after the governmentnegotiated the release of hostages held at the Leopards camp. Atleast five people were believed held at one stage, includingAvril's wife, Marie-Ange, one of their sons and the defense andinterior minister, Acedius St. Louis.   Louis Dejoie, a moderate politician, said pressure for a couphad grown for a month and dismissal of the army officers ``was thelast straw.''   The United States made a crackdown on drug trafficking acondition for restoring $70 million in aid suspended after theabortive elections of 1987, during which thugs killed 34 voters.</TEXT></DOC>
