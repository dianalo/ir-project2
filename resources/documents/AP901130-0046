Ultimatum Prompts Mixed Emotions Among Hostage Families</HEAD><HEAD>With PM-Gulf-UN, Bjt</HEAD><BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Relatives of American hostages are agonizing over the U.N.resolution aimed at driving Iraq from Kuwait, many noting thatwhile force may be the only answer, it will put the lives of theirloved ones in danger.   The resolution, adopted by the U.N. Security Council onThursday, authorizes an attack if Iraqi President Saddam Husseindoesn't withdraw his troops from Kuwait and free all hostages byJan. 15.   ``I've got a son over there and, of course, when the bulletsstart flying he's in danger,'' said George Carroll of Winfield,Kan. ``But I still think it's about all we can do. We can't letthis go on forever.''   Carroll's son, a pediatric neurologist, is trapped in the U.S.Embassy in Kuwait.   Some hostage families said the ultimatum itself might endangerthe estimated 900 Americans stranded in Iraq or Kuwait.   Kristine Knutson said she is anxious about what Iraqi troopsmight do in the face of a Jan. 15 deadline. Her husband has been inhiding since the couple decided she and their four young childrenshould flee to Minnesota.   ``For his peace of mind, it might help knowing there's adeadline,'' said Ms. Knutson, who asked that her maiden name beused to protect her husband's identity. ``But I wonder how (theIraqis) will react to the increased pressure.''   David McDonald Jr., who has a close friend in hiding in Kuwait,said he believes his friend, a Midwestern dentist, would supportthe resolution.   ``My friend is not a warmonger, but I think he realizes it's theonly realistic option if Saddam is to be stopped,'' he said.   But Donnita Cole, who was among a group of hostage relativesscheduled to visit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad next week, said shecannot abide an offensive stance - at least not until everydiplomatic option is exhausted.   ``I want to know what gives our president the power to decidethat on a certain date we're going to start a war,'' said Mrs.Cole, whose husband is among Western hostages being held by Iraq as``human shields'' to discourage an attack.   ``What gives him the power in the month of November to say thatin January we're going to start a war?'' she asked. ``It should notbe an American military offensive as a presidential option but asan act of Congress, and the people Congress is supposed torepresent.''   ``At least (the resolution) puts some kind of a time frame on itall,'' said Bonnie Anderton, whose husband has taken refuge at theU.S. Embassy in Baghdad.   ``But it's just another ratcheting of the stakes,'' Mrs.Anderton said from Larkspur, Colo. ``And (Saddam) has said he'sgoing to ignore it.''   Jennifer Williams, 21, who is planning a trip to Baghdad toplead for freedom for her father and stepmother, said the deadlineis spurring her to do as much as she can while she still has thechance. Her parents are being held as human shields.   ``I think many people in my situation would do the same thing,''said the student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.   ``It's not an option. It's something I have to do,'' she said.``I don't want my family to die in a war ... and because of thisdeadline, I feel like I need to act quickly.''</TEXT></DOC>
