Afghan troops violated Pakistani air space and territory 295times from May 15 to Aug. 18, the Pakistani official charged.   Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Unionsigned a U.N.-sponsored accord on April 14 to arrange a pullout ofan estimated 115,000 Soviet troops that have been helping theAfghan government fight U.S.-backed rebels. Half of them have gonehome, while the rest are to leave by Feb. 15.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 27people were killed and 85 injured in Afghan artillery shelling ofPakistani border areas. He said 13 died and 29 were injured in airraids and bombings.   He told reporters that more Afghan aircraft have been violatingPakistani air space in recent weeks.   Pakistani F-16 fighters engaged an Afghan warplane on September7, and the army has claimed that the plane was shot down.Afghanistan has denied the claim.   ``Pakistan air force has proof on film that the raiding warplanewas shot down,'' the spokesman said.   He said efforts were continuing to locate the wreckage of thewarplane.   Asked to comment on Kabul's allegations that the Pakistani armyis helping anti-communist guerrillas fight Afghan security forcesin southeastern Afghanistan, the spokesman said ``its completelybaseless.''   The spokesman said Islamabad might play a role in a prisoner ofwar exchange, using its influence with the guerrillas to freeSoviet POWs.   ``But there are no Soviet POWs on Pakistani territory, and ifand when there were any, we handed them over to the Soviets,'' hesaid.   A Pakistani newspaper, the Frontier Post, reported Thursday thatPakistan is mediating between the Soviets and the rebels inarranging the release of 300 Soviet POWs.   ``It is premature to say that an agreement has been reached,''the spokesman said.   Rebel sources have never disclosed the number of Soviet warprisoners but different resistence groups are believed to holdaround 50. They say the prisoners are being held in Afghanistan.</TEXT></DOC>
