In a surprise move, West Germany and Japan pledged at the meetings to take some modest, but still significant, steps to stimulate more demand at home -- moves the U.S. has been pressing them to take so they can increase their share of world-wide export purchases and help relieve the huge trade imbalances among the three countries. The U.S. posted a trade deficit of $170 billion in 1986, while West Germany and Japan accumulated surpluses of $63 billion and $89 billion, respectively.    Without actually saying they will intervene in the exchange markets to support current rates, the six countries hinted broadly that they would be ready, at least in the short run, to buy or sell dollars if necessary to help stabilize the dollar and other important currencies, such as the West German mark and the Japanese yen.    Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, said the ministers held &quot;a full discussion of the circumstances under which we would engage in intervention,&quot; and had &quot;privately agreed&quot; on some guidelines and procedures. However, other officials indicated any intervention efforts weren't likely to be massive.    There was no indication how far the U.S., Germany and Japan in particular would allow their currencies to fluctuate before they would intervene. Although the ministers stopped well short of establishing formal &quot;reference ranges&quot; -- specific upper and lower limits for their currencies -- as the U.S. initially had proposed, they hinted they had agreed on some informal parameters that might trigger telephone consultations about possible joint intervention in specific cases. As is customary, the ministers declined even to discuss the issue, in the hope that their silence would give them more leverage by keeping the exchange markets off balance.    The markets are expected to move quickly this week to test the ministers' willingness to intervene and the size of the fluctuations that they are willing to tolerate.    Yani Budiman, a vice president at Chemical Bank, said, &quot;I'm still rather skeptical of the results of the meeting. We may have to wait for the January (U.S.) trade deficit&quot; to see how the dollar will move.    As trading began in the Asia-Pacific region Monday, the dollar rose in what was described as nervous and uncertain activity. Traders in Sydney, Australia, said market participants wanted to see concrete evidence that the countries at the Paris meeting would act to stabilize the dollar.    During Monday morning trading in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 1.8335 West German marks, up from 1.8183 late in New York Friday, and at 154.00 yen, up from 153.58.    Despite the skepticism in the foreign-exchange markets, the accord appeared to be more substantive than initially expected. Both U.S. and foreign officials had been playing down prospects for any immediate action, in part to avoid creating unrealistic expectations.    Specifically, West Germany pledged to increase the size of the tax cuts it has already scheduled for 1988. It also will proceed with a planned tax-revision bill. At the same time, Japan agreed to propose a new economic-stimulus package designed to revive its flagging economy.    The Bank of Japan announced on Friday a cut in its discount rate -- the interest charged on short-term loans to banks -- to a record 2.5% from 3%, effective today. But most analysts say the rate reduction won't do much to spur demand in Japan, because interest rates there already are so low.    Only the U.S. failed to pledge any policy changes. Treasury Secretary James Baker said Washington believes it is moving rapidly enough to reduce the federal budget deficit under the Gramm-Rudman targets. He said raising taxes to close the deficit &quot;would be detrimental to our economy.&quot;    While Mr. Baker welcomed the pledges made by West Germany and Japan, neither country gave any hint of the size of the new stimulus measures it was planning. Japan's package is still in the preliminary planning stage; Japanese stimulus efforts traditionally have been relatively mild. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the size of the increase in the scheduled 1988 tax cut that his country had promised would be hammered out as part of the process of building a new coalition in the wake of last January's elections.    Government sources in Bonn have said the tax cut scheduled for next January could be expanded to about $10 billion, twice its present size. However, the stimulus Mr. Stoltenberg promised in Paris may receive close scrutiny in West Germany's parliament. For almost a month, the newly elected government's three coalition parties have been squabbling over the scope of tax cuts to be proposed in the new legislative period.    They may still be able to reach a compromise, agreeing to tax relief equivalent to around $22 billion that would take effect in 1989 or 1990. But the move to enlarge the separate January 1988 tax cut could further complicate the coalition talks. That's because any enlargement of next January's tax cut probably would come out of the envisioned $22 billion package. And Bonn's junior coalition partners, the liberal Free Democratic Party and the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, already have strenuously protested what they view as efforts by the Christian Democrats to water down the broader tax package.    Similarly uncertain was what political reaction the new accord would spark in the U.S. Some U.S. officials fear that Congress has become so convinced that a further decline in the dollar is needed to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit that it might seriously protest a U.S. move to help stabilize the dollar. Mr. Baker hopes the prospect that West Germany and Japan may finally be moving toward stimulating their import-buying might soften some of that opposition.    The thrust of the new pact was to shift the focus of the large industrial countries from driving the dollar down further -- as they began to do with their accord of September 1985 -- to stabilizing exchange rates at current levels and moving toward more serious policy changes designed to reduce the global trade imbalances, which economists say could bring on a world-wide recession if they aren't pared back.    Britain's Mr. Lawson called yesterday's agreement &quot;Plaza II.&quot; The original Plaza Accord, so named because it was hammered out during a meeting at New York's Plaza Hotel in September 1985, succeeded in driving the dollar down to an appropriate level, the chancellor said. &quot;Now we have decided we need stability, and we will act accordingly.&quot;    The move toward stabilizing currencies reflects a feeling among all the major industrial countries that the dollar has declined enough, and that too sharp a further drop might prove self-defeating by crimping export sales in West Germany and Japan too severely, undermining any hope that either country will be able to spur its import-buying. The U.S. also is worried that a continuing plunge in the dollar might revive inflation and plunge the economy into a recession.    The final accord represented a series of trade-offs among the U.S., Germany and Japan. The U.S. had wanted West Germany to speed up the effective date of its tax cuts rather than merely to increase the size of the reductions; Bonn, on the other hand, had resisted any sort of stimulus moves for months.    Washington's own concession, in return for the West German and Japanese agreement to propose new stimulus measures, was to join the attempt to stabilize the dollar. At the same time, the U.S. received relatively little from Japan.    As anticipated, yesterday's accord was modeled in part on a bilateral currency-stabilization pact worked out last Oct. 31 by Mr. Baker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. That agreement also sought to keep the yen and the U.S. dollar relatively stable over the near term -- in that particular case, holding the dollar to between 152 and 164 yen. It worked for about three months, until the markets became disillusioned with Japan's new stimulus efforts.    However, besides having a broader scope, the new six-country accord is different from the Oct. 31 compact in two respects: The new pact contains promises for new economic-policy measures, while the U.S.-Japan accord merely listed steps that already had been under way. And while U.S. officials indicated they had made no pledge for joint intervention in the Baker-Miyazawa accord, they conspicuously declined to rule that out in yesterday's six-nation pact -- a hint that such intervention is likely.    Ironically, while negotiations leading to yesterday's accord were speeded up to help stem a new slide in the dollar that began last month, the actual announcement comes at a time when the dollar's value has stabilized somewhat, giving the effort added impetus from going &quot;with the grain of the markets,&quot; as Britain's Mr. Lawson put it.    The original Plaza Accord in 1985 had enjoyed a similar push the other way, essentially accelerating a dollar decline that had begun the previous February.    Yesterday's accord marked the seventh international initiative Mr. Baker has launched in his two-year-old effort to trim the U.S. trade deficit and stave off protectionist pressures in Congress. Besides the original Plaza Accord, the Treasury chief also has engineered a round of coordinated international interest-rate cuts, a new set of machinery for the major nations to use in coordinating their economic policies and several more minor efforts. Each has achieved what U.S. officials have labeled &quot;incremental&quot; progress. Mr. Baker called yesterday's accord &quot;another step forward in our efforts to achieve closer and more effective coordination of economic policies.&quot;    Along with their other pledges, the ministers vowed yesterday to continue work on the new policy-coordination machinery they agreed on at last May's Tokyo economic summit, deciding yesterday to use exchange-rate changes as one of several early-warning signals to alert countries that they may need to change their domestic economic policies. Other indicators the ministers decided to watch include growth rates, inflation, trade balances and current accounts, budget performance and monetary conditions.    The currency accord was to have included Italy, but Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Goria walked out of the meeting yesterday morning because the compact essentially had been worked out formally by ministers of the Group of Five industrial countries the day before.    The agreed-upon procedure had been for the five to meet on Saturday and then be joined by Canada and Italy yesterday. Italy's departure isn't expected to have much impact, because its currency is not widely traded on international foreign-exchange markets.    Mr. Baker called the Italian walkout &quot;unexpected,&quot; but expressed confidence that &quot;this will work itself out.&quot; Italy, meanwhile, has threatened to withdraw its invitation to be host for this year's seven-nation economic summit, scheduled to be held in Venice in June.    ---   Friday's Dollar Activity   In trading Friday, the dollar declined against most other major currencies, in advance of the weekend meeting.    Traders said dealings were limited to last-minute position-squaring. Uncertainty about what the Paris meeting would produce dissuaded market participants from carrying currency positions over the weekend, dealers said.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8183 West German marks, down from 1.8310 Thursday. The U.S. currency also eased to 153.58 Japanese yen from 153.80.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
