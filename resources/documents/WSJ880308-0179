The Electronics Industries Association of Japan said the exports increased 1.6%, to 249,000 units, aided by a surge in shipments to Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Exports of the televisions have been hurt by a shortage of foreign exchange in China, efforts to limit Japanese imports and the strong yen.    The association also said that exports of videotape recorders declined for the 15th consecutive month in January, falling 0.6% from a year earlier, to 1.3 million units. VTR exports have been curbed by a growing reliance on overseas production facilities and the strong yen. </TEXT></DOC>
