(Integrated Services Digital Network) (technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Haas, Zygmunt.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>An alternative to conventional layered architectures forhigh-speed communication over broadband ISDN is a new protocolstructure in which vertical layering is reduced.andP;  The newarchitecture involves reducing the fourth, fifth, and sixth layersof the International Organization for Standardization/Open SystemsInterconnection Reference Model to a single, horizontallystructured layer.andP;  The Horizontally Oriented Protocol Structure(HOPS) consists of the Network Access Control layer, theCommunication Interface layer, and the Application Layer.andP;  HOPSlends itself to parallel implementation of processes, which canlead to improved performance.andP;  HOPS, which is capable ofsupporting a wide variety of applications and data rates, can helpeliminate the problems of decreased throughput and increased delayassociated with multilayered architectures.andP;  An example of HOPSimplementation is presented.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ProtocolTelecommunicationsNetwork ArchitectureBroadbandISDNInterface.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Horizontally Oriented Protocol Structure.
