The Bartlesville, Okla., company estimated the move willsave $150 million annually, indicating savings of about$136,000 per employee terminated. That estimate sounds high,some analysts said, but they added that the company must paredebt and thus they welcomed the move.</LP><TEXT>   As of Dec. 31, Phillips had about $3.9 billion in debt, anamount equal to roughly 59% of its capital, analysts said.&quot;Given that the industry isn't in good shape, with saggingoil and natural gas prices, Phillips is clearly a companyunder the gun,&quot; said Frank Kneuttel, an analyst at PrudentialSecurities.   In the fourth quarter, Phillips earlier said net incomeplunged 67% to $79 million, or 30 cents a share, afterone-time gains. Revenue fell 24% to $3.37 billion.   Phillips said the dismissals are expected to begin inMarch and be completed by the end of June. Most employeesaffected are in Bartlesville, the company said. Phillips has22,500 employees worldwide.   Prudential's Mr. Kneuttel said he doubts Phillips can saveas much as $150 million by trimming just 1,100 employees.&quot;That's $136,000 apiece. If that's correct, it suggests ahighly paid group of people,&quot; he said.   A Phillips spokesman stuck by the estimate. &quot;These arestaff people. They could be engineers, geologists or publicrelations people. Next month you could get a recording at myphone,&quot; he said. The company said about 950 of those to beaffected are in Bartlesville and the rest are in Houston andseveral unidentified field locations.   Layoffs have been accelerating in the U.S. oil patch aspetroleum prices continue to be flat, exploration costs riseand the amount of production and yields of new wells decline.The average U.S. well currently produces about 10 barrels ofoil per day, a fraction of those in the Middle East.   Analysts consider the layoffs a part of an overallrestructuring at Phillips that includes the company'sdisclosure earlier this month that it plans to sell as muchas 51% of its natural gas gathering and processing unit toraise cash and pay down debt. Phillips, like other companiesin the industry, has been hurt by the plunge in natural gasprices to 12-year lows.   In trading late yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,Phillips was at $22.875, down 37.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
