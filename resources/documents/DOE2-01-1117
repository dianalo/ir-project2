Therefore, the design of the repositorymust provide flexibility to respond to changes in program guidance, tovariability in geologic characteristics, and to site specific requirements.Programmatic issues affecting design include waste type, quantity, burnup,and age; the existence of other system elements such as a monitored retrievalstorage facility; consolidation of fuel elements; emplacement of otherwaste types; and schedule for first and second repository. In additionto programmatic decisions, site specific decisions such as waste emplacementgeometry affect repository design. The approach has been to develop initialdesigns that provide flexibility and consider the program and designissues listed above. The next step in the program must be to resolveprogrammatic and site specific issues and thereby reduce the multiplicityof design efforts. 12 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
