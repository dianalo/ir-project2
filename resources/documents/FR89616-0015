These revisions containeddeficiencies within the State's Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) regulations.EPA is proposing to disapprove the following regulations that have beenidentified as being deficient: Regulations 62.1, Section I, 39., Regulation62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part A.1., A.9, A.22, A.38, A.39, A.51,A.75., Section II, Part C.1., Section I, Part A.75., Section II, PartsA through H and Parts N through T., Section I, Part F., Section I, PartE. The deficiencies identified within each regulation proposed for disapprovalare discussed in detail in the Supplementary Information section of thisnotice. Today's proposed disapproval action provides the basis for correctingthe deficiencies identified within South Carolina's State ImplementationPlan (SIP).

These revisionswere adopted by the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Controlon December 20, 1984, and were forwarded to the State Legislature for approval.The revisions became State-effective on May 24, 1985. Based on the informationsubmitted, EPA attempted to disapprove them without prior proposal (54FR 72 April 17, 1989).In the direct-final disapproval, EPA advised the public that the effectivedate of the action was deferred for 60 days (until June 16, 1989) to providean opportunity to submit comments on it. EPA announced that if notice wasreceived within 30 days of the publication of the final rule that someonewanted to submit adverse or critical comments, the final action would bewithdrawn and a new rulemaking would be begun by proposing a 30-day commentperiod. EPA had earlier published a general notice explaining this specialprocedure (46 FR 44477, September 4, 1981).EPA has received adverse comments on this plan. Accordingly, EPA is takingfinal action elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>to withdraw the April 17, 1989 direct-final disapprovaland is in this notice proposing the disapproval for public comment. Thisproposed disapproval is based on the following considerations:On May 3, 1988, EPA released the latest data on the degree to which areasthroughout the nation have attained the NAAQ. On May 26, 1988, the HonorableCarroll A. Campbell was notified that the South Carolina SIP is substantiallyinadequate to achieve the ozone NAAQS, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H)of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H). In this letter, EPA requestedthat South Carolina respond to the ``SIP call'' in two phases_the firstphase, within 60 days upon receipt of EPA's letter to the States agency(South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control) which outlinedin detail the SIP call response, and the second phase following the issuanceof the final Ozone/CO policy. The first phase requires that the State initiatecertain fundamental activities necessary to continue to make progress inattaining the ozone or CO NAAQS. The required activities include the correctionof identified discrepancies between EPA's existing policy and the State'sSIP or pending SIP submittal.On September 9, 1988, EPA requested that South Carolina correct the identifieddeviations within their SIP. On October 12, 1988, South Carolina notifiedEPA that regulatory revisions within their SIP must be done either undera State inititative or the need to meet federal requirements. In orderfor the regulatory revisions to meet the test of being federal requirements,South Carolina must be able to cite the specific <T4>Federal Register</T4> notification of a deficiency. South Carolinaadditionally stated in their October 12, 1988, letter to EPA that the State-initiatedrevisions involve a more lengthy process, including ratification by theSouth Carolina General Assembly.In order to facilitate correction of all EPA-identified deviations withinthe South Carolina VOC regulations, EPA is today proposing disapprovalof the following regulations that have been identified as being deficient:1. Regulation 62.1, Section I, 39._A vapor pressure of 0.1 mm Hg shouldnot be used to define VOC. Such a definition would exempt compounds oflow volatility which under certain processes, would volatilize and thereforeparticipate in photochemical reactions. 2. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part A.1, A.9, A.22, A.38,A.39, A.51, A.75._These various coating definitions need to specificallyinclude ``functional coatings'' as well as protective or decorative films.3. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section II, Part C.1._This regulationfor the surface coating of paper, vinyl and fabric does not specificallyapply to saturation processes and must therefore be revised to includethem. 4. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part A.75._The vinyl coatingdefinition must be revised to make clear that organisol and plastisol coatingscannot be used to bubble emissions from vinyl printing and topcoating.5. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section II, Part A, B, C, D, E, F,G, H, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T_In the provision for specific sources severalconcerns have been identified. They are as follows: (i) The regulations within Section II, Parts A through H and Parts N throughT need to be revised to clearly state compliance period (e.g., hourly,daily) and averaging method (arithmetic or weighted). (ii) Capture systems are required as a method of control technology forthe following surface coating regulations: Section II_Provisions for SpecificSources Part A.2.e., B.2.e., C.2.e., D.2.e., E.2.e., Part F.3.e., G.3.e.,H.3.e. (iii) Regulations which require capture efficiency systems must specifytest methods. 6. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part F, Recordkeeping, Reporting,Monitoring_The recordkeeping requirement provisions as stated in the May25, 1988, OAQPS document entitled, ``Issues Relating to VOC RegulationCutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations,'' should be included within thisregulation. 7. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part E, Volatile OrganicCompound Compliance Testing_It is not clear in the VOC compliance testingrequirement that the most recent test methods must be used. The regulationmust be revised to state this. The public is invited to submit written comments on this proposal; EPAwill consider all comments received within 30 days of this date beforetaking final action on the disapproval of revisions submitted by SouthCarolina. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this disapproval will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities becauseits purpose is to provide the State the basis for correcting its SIP. The Office of Management and Budget has waived review of this regulationnormally required under section 3 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects In 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 8, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Greer C.
