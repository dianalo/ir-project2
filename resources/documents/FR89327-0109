Partnerships, limited partnerships organized under the laws of Delaware,are non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies registeredunder the 1940 Act. The investment objective of each Partnership to seeklong-term capital appreciation. Each Partnership is an ``employees' securitiescompany'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(13) of the 1940 Act, and operatesin accordance with the terms of an exemptive order issued pursuant to section6(b) of the 1940 Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 12363; April 8,1982) (``KECALP Exemption Order''). The general partner for each Partnershipis KECALP, Inc. (``KECALP''), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirectsubsidiary of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. (``ML andamp; Co.''). KECALP is responsiblefor managing and making investment decisions for the Partnerships. MLIF,a Delaware corporation engaged in commercial financing transactions, isan indirect subisidary of ML andamp; Co.2. PACE, a Delaware corporation organized in 1984, was a holding companywith assets and businesses consisting solely of Rheem Manufacturing Company,Inc. (``Rheem''), Hayes International Corporation (``Hayes''), Uarco Incorporated(``UARCO''), World Color Press, Inc. and certain of their subsidiariesacquired from City Investing Company on December 13, 1984 (``Acquisition'').PACE financed the Acquisition through (i) the issuance and sale of commonstock, at a price of $5 per share, to several institutional investors,including MLIF, (ii) the issuance and sale of a junior subordinated noteand debentures, and (iii) bank borrowings. In January 1985, PACE raisedadditional capital through the issuance and sale of preferred stock andcertain senior notes and senior and junior subordinated notes and debentures.Shortly thereafter, PACE engaged in an additional offering of common stock,at a price of $5 per share, through a private placement.3. On November 3, 1986, MLIF agreed to sell to the 1984 Partnership andthe 1986 Partnership 30,000 and 170,000 shares, respectively, of the PACEcommon stock owned by MLIF. The amount of shares represented less than0.05% and 0.29%, respectively, of the PACE common stock outstanding ona fully-diluted basis.4. In mid-1987, the Board of Directors of PACE decided to divest PACE ofits Rheem subsidiary. The sale would be effected by the sale of PACE itselfafter the removal of PACE's other subsidiaries. Such a removal was accomplishedby a partial redemption of shareholders' interest in PACE in exchange forPACE's other subsidiaries. To facilitate these transactions, PACE's non-Rheemsubsidiaries were contributed to Printing Holdings, L.P. (``Printing''),a newly formed limited partnership, prior to their distribution to PACEshareholders. On September 29, 1987, Class 1 Units of limited partnershpinterest (``Units'') in Printing were distributed to PACE's shareholdersin the form of a redemptive distribution on a pro rata basis for approximately60.4% of PACE's outstanding common stock. The percentage of PACE's commonstock to be redeemed in exchange for Units was determined by an independentappraisal of the fair market value of PACE's constituent businesses.5. After the distribution of the Units, PACE negotiated an agreement tosell PACE to Paloma Industries, Ltd., a closely held Japanese company (``Paloma'').The sale to Paloma was consummated on April 7, 1988 for a price in cashof approximately $14.16 per remaining share of PACE common stock (as comparedto an original cost basis of $5 per share). As a result of the post-closingaudit of the PACE balance sheet with respect to working capital, Palomamade an additional cash payment to PACE shareholders on May 16, 1988. Thepayment amounted to approximately $0.82 per share of PACE common stock.6. In connection with these transactions, MLIF has allocated distributionsof Units and cash proceeds from the sale of PACE common stock to the Partnershipson a pro rata basis. As a result of the transactions, the shares of PACEcommon stock that MLIF initially agreed to sell to the 1984 Partnershipand the 1986 Partnership were represented by 11,881 shares of PACE commonstock and 18,119 Units in Printing and 67,325 shares of PACE common stockand 102,675 Units in Printing, respectively. Following the sale of PACEcommon stock on April 7, 1988 and the related additional cash payment onMay 16, 1988, MLIF held approximately $177,948 and $1,008,361 for the 1984Partnership and the 1986 Partnership, respectively.7. On October 12, 1988, Printing sold Hayes and UARCO to Precision StandardInc. and SETTSU Corp. of Japan, respectively, for a price in cash aggregatingapproximately $10.98 per Unit of Printing. The proceeds of this sale weredistributed to the partners of Printing on a pro rata basis. As a resultof this transaction, together with the transaction with Paloma describedpreviously, the shares of PACE common stock that MLIF initially agreedto sell to the 1984 Partnership and the 1986 Partnership are representedby approximately $376,817 and 18,119 Units in Printing and $2,135,291 and102,675 Units in Printing, respectively.8. The purchase price to be paid by the Partnerships to MLIF for the proceedsfrom sale of the shares of common stock of PACE and the Units proposedto be acquired by the Partnerships will be the lower of (i) the fair valueof the cash proceeds and Units on the date they are acquired by the Partnerships(as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of KECALP) or (ii)the cost to MLIF of purchasing and holding the investment. With respectto clause (ii), such cost shall be the original purchase price of $5 pershare paid for the shares of PACE common stock, plus carrying costs relatingto the investment. Carrying costs will consist of interest charges computedat the lower of (i) the prime commercial lending rate charged by Citibank,N.A. during the period from December 13, 1984, the date MLIF acquired theinvestment, until the date the Partnerships acquire the investment, or(ii) the effective cost of borrowings by ML andamp; Co., as defined below,during such period. The effective cost of borrowings by ML andamp; Co. isits actual ``Average Cost of Funds,'' which it calculates on a monthlybasis by dividing its consolidated financing expenses by the total amountof its borrowings during this period. As of September 30, 1988, the carryingcosts payable to MLIF by the 1984 Partnership and the 1986 Partnershipaggregated approximately $48,000 and $277,000, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Conclusions</ITAG>9. As a result of affiliations, sales of securities on a principal basisby KECALP and MLIF to the Partnerships are prohibited by section 17 andcannot be effected unless exemptive relief is obtained under section 17(d).The Applicants submit that the statutory standards with respect to therelief requested under section 17(b) are satisfied: Relief is justifiedboth by the terms of the transactions and the fact that the proposed investmentsare not otherwise available to the Partnerships. With respect to the termsof the transactions, the KECALP Board of Directors has reviewed the proposedinvestments in detail. The members of the KECALP Board are sophisticatedand experienced in valuing securities and in evaluating financial transactionsgenerally. The KECALP Board considered all information deemed releventto the proposed investments, including the nature of the investments, thenature of the investments by affiliates of ML andamp; Co., and the fairnessof the purchase prices to be paid by the Partnerships. The KECALP Boarddetermined that the proposed investments by the Partnerships will not directlyor indirectly benefit entities affiliated with ML andamp; Co. or its subsidiarieswhich also acquired investments in PACE. Moreover, the KECALP Board approvedthe Partnerships' investments in PACE after consideration of each of thefactors set forth in section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.10. In evaluating the terms of the transactions, the KECALP Board consideredthe fact that the proposed purchase prices to be paid by the Partnershipswill include carrying costs incurred by an affiliated person, <T3>i.e., </T3>MLIF, if the fair value of the investment at the time ofacquisition by the Partnerships is more than the sum of the purchase priceplus the affiliate's carrying costs. In approving purchase prices whichmay include carrying costs, the KECALP Board recognized that KECALP receivesno compensation for serving as general partner of the Partnerships andthat ML andamp; Co. has incurred considerable expenses in organizing thePartnerships. The Partnerships believe that it is appropriate to reimburseMLIF for its carrying costs in order to induce MLIF to make investmentsavailable to the Partnerships in the future. The Partnerships would havepurchased the PACE investment directly, had it not been deemed necessaryto obtain the relief requested herein. In light of these factors, the KECALPBoard believes it is wholly appropriate for the purchase price paid forportfolio investments to reflect carrying costs, provided that the fairvalue of each investment at the time of acquisition exceeds the amountof the purchase price, plus carrying costs. The Applicants submit thatto deny reimbursement for carrying costs would result in a further andunwarranted loss to MLIF and would provide a disincentive for it to acton behalf of the Partnerships in the future.11. The Applicants note that the Partnerships propose to reimburse MLIFfor its carrying costs from December 13, 1984, the date that MLIF acquiredthe original investment in PACE, rather than from November 3, 1986, thedate on which the KECALP Board approved the investments for the Partnerships.The Applicants recognize that, for purposes of calculating the reimbursementof an affiliated person's carrying costs, a Partnership generally bearssuch costs from the later of the date the KECALP Board approved the Partnership'spurchase of an investment or the date the investment was acquired by theaffiliated person. The Partnerships believe that in this instance, however,it is appropriate to compensate MLIF for its carrying costs for a longerperiod. As noted above, the KECALP Board of Directors is experienced invaluing securities and evaluating financial transactions. In making itsdetermination that the Partnerships should acquire the investments, theKECALP Board considered, among other things, several analyses by investmentbankers, including a letter furnished by PACE that estimated the fair marketvalue of shares of PACE common stock based upon analyses of investmentbankers. On the basis of such information, the KECALP Board determinedthat the market value of shares of PACE common stock was significantlyin excess of the proposed purchase price, including carrying costs. TheApplicants believe that the subsequent events involving PACE support theKECALP Board's determination to the extent that the proposed investmentshave already produced proceeds greater than the proposed purchase pricesof the investments. The investments by the 1984 Partnership and the 1986Partnership will cost $150,000 and $850,000, respectively, plus carryingcosts in the aggregate amounts of approximately $48,000 and $277,000, respectively.In return, the 1984 Partnership will receive $376,817 and 18,119 Unitsof Printing, and the 1986 Partnership will receive $2,135,219 and 102,675Units of Printing. Based upon estimates provided by a group within MerrillLynch that works in the area of leveraged buyouts, the KECALP Board understandsthat the value of the remaining companies owned by Printing is approximately$1.5 million, or $12.42 per Unit. It therefore appears that the returnon each Partnership's investment will substantially exceed the purchaseprice of the investment. In view of these considerations, the Partnershipsbelieve that their reimbursement of MLIF's carrying costs during the periodfrom December 13, 1984 will serve as an inducement to MLIF to make investmentsavailable to the Partnerships, particularly investments such as the onein PACE, which MLIF believed to be extremely profitable at the time itwas offered to the Partnerships.12. The Applicants further submit that the investments are not otherwiseavailable for purchase by the Partnerships. The KECALP Board has approvedsuch investments after review of a considerable number of possible investmentsfor the Partnerships. The Partnerships state that their respective investmentprograms will be prejudiced if they are not permitted to make the investmentsproposed in this Application.13. The Board of Directors of KECALP believes that the proposed investmentsare consistent with the rationale underlying the establishment of eachof the Partnerships as an ``employees' securities company.'' It was indicatedin the application for exemptive relief granted in the KECALP ExemptiveOrder, as well as in the prospectuses of the Partnerships, that ML andamp;Co. and its affiliates would be involved in structuring, identifying andinvesting in many of the Partnerships' portfolio investments. The Partnershipsstate that the relief requested is thus consistent with their purposesand stated policies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:1. The investments in PACE will be acquired by the Partnerships in themanner and on the terms described above.2. In connection with the deliberations and determinations by the KECALPBoard of Directors regarding the Partnerships' proposed investments inPACE, appropriate record-keeping will be maintained and made availablefor inspection by the Commission and by the limited partners of the Partnershipsin accordance with the KECALP Exemptive Order and the 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
