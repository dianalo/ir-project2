Before the unit can be sold, however, the Delaware Insurance Department must decide whether American Centennial has set aside adequate reserves to cover losses from its reinsurance business. The department recently completed an audit of American Centennial but hasn't disclosed the results. A ruling on the reserves question is expected when Beneficial applies to the department for a change of control, perhaps early next month.    The financial services company insists that its reserves are &quot;more than adequate&quot; because it put $260 million into the unit in the 1986 third quarter. &quot;We're fine right now,&quot; says Andrew C. Halvorsen, Beneficial's chief financial officer.    But federal court documents filed by reinsurers suing American Centennial in New York and Philadelphia suggest that the unit could be financially crippled and might face &quot;imminent financial collapse&quot; if Beneficial doesn't add more reserves. State investigators looking into possible fraud that caused some of American Centennial's heavy losses say they share that view.    &quot;They're looking at a black hole. Nobody knows how deep it is, and it's getting worse every month,&quot; says Martin Hoffman, a New York accountant who has been scouring records for months on behalf of reinsurers suing American Centennial.    Beneficial, plagued for years by heavy reinsurance losses that it charges stemmed from fraud by one of its agents, finally put itself up for sale last August. But Beneficial's potential acquirers at the time, who likely would have trouble turning the insurance unit around, didn't want to touch the subsidiary.    Now Beneficial is trying to sell most of its major units separately and keep only its core consumer lending business. Beneficial says it's nearing a sale of the unit, but it wouldn't disclose the buyer. Analysts have speculated that the unit could be sold to specialists who can rehabilitate it.    Analysts and investors consider the sale or disposal of American Centennial to be crucial because of the unit's drain on Beneficial's earnings. Beneficial has put almost $500 million into the operation in recent years and expects to report a 1986 net loss of $50 million because of a charge for the $260 million addition to reserves.    Anthony Pearce-Batten, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore, has watched Beneficial's restructuring closely. He says he thinks Beneficial will have to add about $100 million before taxes to reserves, based on his knowledge of the unit's problems and a review of financial statements.    &quot;The unit is hemorrhaging,&quot; Mr. Pearce-Batten says. &quot;The question is how much more do they have to put into it.&quot;    Recently, American Centennial's ability to pay claims has been further hampered by reinsurers seeking court orders and arbitration rulings on what they owe American Centennial. Two temporary restraining orders have prevented Beneficial from cashing letters of credit posted by reinsurers to assure payments for claims. Ten disputes with different reinsurers have gone to arbitration.    Moreover, reinsurers claim in suits that American Centennial has been a victim of a second fraud by an agent hired to bring in business. American Centennial itself has already sued an agent it alleges siphoned millions of dollars in premiums and distributed the risk to insolvent or fraudulent reinsurers.    In addition, Beneficial's actuaries made what the Wilmington, Del.-based company calls a &quot;mathematical error&quot; of $30 million. As a result, the reserves that Beneficial posted in the third quarter for American Centennial may be $30 million less than the company intended.    American Centennial's alleged insolvency is described in an affidavit attached to a suit by Walton Insurance Co., Bermuda. In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, Walton is seeking to nullify a $10 million claim by American Centennial because of the fraud allegedly committed by the Beneficial unit's agent. The matter has gone to arbitration.    The affidavit contains an extensive analysis of American Centennial's condition by Mr. Hoffman, the New York accountant retained by Walton and other reinsurers suing American Centennial.    In his affidavit, Mr. Hoffman says American Centennial won't be able to collect the $142 million it shows in its most recent quarterly statement as recoverable. The reinsurance companies that owe the money are either insolvent or have refused to pay because of the alleged frauds, the affidavit says.    The fraud investigators who have seen Mr. Hoffman's analysis say they also believe American Centennial is &quot;impaired and bankrupt.&quot; The investigators said they haven't reviewed American Centennial's records, but they base their estimates on the fraud claims the insurance unit has made.    &quot;If you're asking me, I think ACI still has big, big problems,&quot; says one of the investigators.    Beneficial's Mr. Halvorsen asserts that American Centennial isn't &quot;impaired or bankrupt.&quot; And Scott K. Goodell, senior vice president of American Centennial, says that Mr. Hoffman's numbers were &quot;picked out of thin air&quot; and that he was making &quot;arbitrary accounting entries for obligations that will take years to come due.    &quot;You never know what's out there in the future, but we think we have posted adequate reserves,&quot; says Mr. Goodell.    Under normal circumstances, reinsurers share claims risks in exchange for premiums of policies written by other companies. But the solvent reinsurers who are refusing to pay Beneficial contend they were duped by American Centennial's agents. Walton, for example, claims it isn't obligated to pay claims to American Centennial because the agent who arranged the contract misled and misrepresented policies to Walton on &quot;hundreds&quot; of cases.    The agent, Dar Allen Reinsurance Agency Inc., Chicago, improperly reported and misappropriated premium funds, understated reserves and wrote medical malpractice policies without authorization, according to Walton's suit. Such practices made Walton liable for claims far greater than it contracted for, the suit claims.    Dar Allen didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    Beneficial's Mr. Halvorsen acknowledges that the company failed to oversee properly the managing general agents who wrote insurance business for American Centennial. The unit even filed its own suit against an agent alleging he committed a different fraud.    Some reinsurers are also claiming they don't owe Beneficial money because of that alleged fraud. Beneficial didn't specify damages in its suit.    But Mr. Halvorsen and other Beneficial officials maintain that there wasn't any fraud in the contracts with Dar Allen and that the reinsurers disputing those contracts and those that are insolvent will have to pay Beneficial.    &quot;I don't concede that money is uncollectable,&quot; says Mr. Goodell.    In response to the Walton suit, American Centennial says it considers the alleged violations to be &quot;garden-variety breaches of contract,&quot; rather than fraud. In a reply filed with the court, American Centennial says Walton's claims are &quot;no more than Walton's desire to avoid paying its bills.&quot; And if Dar Allen did commit any fraud, the reply says, then American Centennial is &quot;victim rather than perpetrator.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
