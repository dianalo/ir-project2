The efficacy of CT-Scan, Iodo-Cholesterol Scintigraphy,digitalized phlebography, adrenal vein sampling for steroid measurements(AVS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in 160 hypertensive patientswith primary aldosteronism was reviewed. Diagnosis of Conn's adenoma(n=96) or Adrenal Hyperplasia (n=40) was confirmed by surgery or at leasttwo concordant tumour localization tests. Scintigraphy gave a correctdiagnosis in 53% of the 51 exams, CT-Scan in 82% of the 85 exams, andphlebography in 79% of 61 exams. Plasma Aldosterone/Cortisol ratio was5 times higher on the side of adenoma in 55% of the 47 cases but thisratio was also present in 23% of 22 patients with adrenal hyperplasia.Each procedure exhibited few false positive and false negative cases.NMR performed in 15 patients with Conn's adenoma identified all the cases.But tumours displayed a signal close to the liver signal and identicalto the normal adrenal. These results and the risk of invasive procedurefailure of catheterization of the right adrenal vein (n=6) and adrenalhaematoma (n=2) lead to propose a schema of exploration of patients withprimary aldosteronism. The CT-Scan could be performed at the first steponce the biological diagnosis confirmed. Phlebography and AVS will beperformed only if tumour was less than 1 cm at the CT-Scan despite importantbiological abnormalities. This schema requires to be validated by a prospectiveevaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
