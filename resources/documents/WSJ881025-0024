Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ARC </CO><IN> INI STK PET </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Atlantic Richfield Co. said it is considering an initial public offering of about 50% of its Lyondell Petrochemical Co. unit, which some industry analysts said could raise as much as $1.5 billion.    An equity offering of that size would be the largest ever for a U.S. industrial concern, topping a $1.37 billion offering of 51.8 million common shares by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in June, said Eugene Nowak, an oil-industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, in New York.    Mr. Nowak said that his firm has placed a &quot;conservative&quot; value on Lyondell of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and that the public offering of 50% would probably be close to $1.5 billion. Arco said it would continue to own the remaining stock of Lyondell, which would be slightly less than 50%.    Lyondell produces ethylene, propylene and methanol at its petrochemicals complex in Channelview, Texas, and gasoline and other petroleum products at its Houston refinery. The company had second-quarter earnings of $125 million, compared with $31 million a year earlier.    In connection with the offering, Arco plans a $500 million debt financing by Lyondell, with the entire $500 million to be paid in a special distribution to Arco. The $500 million financing would be the sole obligation of Lyondell, and existing lease obligations relating to Lyondell facilities would also be assumed by Lyondell.    Arco said it plans to use proceeds from the offering and special distribution for general corporate purposes, including an expansion of its stock-purchase program. In April 1985, the oil company announced a $4 billion stock-purchase plan, and it has since spent $3.9 billion to buy 62 million of its shares at an average cost of about $63 each. Arco had about 178.5 million common shares and common-share equivalents outstanding as of Sept. 30.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Arco shares fell $1.875 to close at $80.875.    Arco cautioned that while it is considering filing a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the proposed offering, &quot;no assurances can be made that the filing will take place or that any subsequent offering will be made or completed.&quot;    Last October, Arco sold a 20% stake in Arco Chemical Co. in an initial public offering that raised $592.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
