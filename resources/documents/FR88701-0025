As a result, in 1987 in theproposed rule on ``Zones in which lead shot will be prohibited for thetaking of waterfowl, coots and certain other species in the 1988-89 season(52 FR 1636), the Service proposed inclusion of loose shot in the 50 CFR20.21(j) restrictions on methods of taking. On the basis of response fromthe muzzleloading industry and community, the Service concluded that: (a)No unusually great health and safety problems exist for muzzleloading huntersusing steel shot in modern construction muzzleloading shotguns; (b) shootingsteel shot will not harm the modern muzzleloading shotgun that steel shotis used in (provided the appropriate loading components are used); and(c) steel shot is an effective tool for harvesting waterfowl when usedin a muzzleloading shotgun at ranges commonly accepted by muzzleloadinghunters as being effective for lead shot. The Service then published, asa final rule (52 FR 27352), the changes in andSection;20.21(j) that requireall hunters of wild waterfowl and coots to use nontoxic shot in nontoxicshot zones. The inclusion of muzzleloading hunters becomes effective onSeptember 1, 1988. This action is taken pursuant to the authority vestedin the Secretary of the Interior by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended(16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq.;</T3> 40 Stat. 755).Since the final rulemaking, the Service has funded a study on the use ofsteel shot in muzzleloaders. This two-part study, load data developmentand destruction testing, demonstrated that hunting waterfowl with steelshot in muzzleloaders can be safe and effective. The abstract of the studyreport is as follows:The suitability, compatibility, limitations, and safety of steel shot whenloaded in 12 gauge, black powder muzzleloading shotguns were assessed infield testing in North Dakota and Arkansas and in laboratory testing inOregon and Maryland during 1987-88. Three successful 12-gauge 1\1/8\ ounce(492 grains) and four successful 1 ounce (437 grains) steel shot loadswere developed using GOEX FFg black powder and Non-Toxic Components steelshot wads. Destruction testing of four 12-gauge muzzleloading shotguns,using the highest pressure load of the successful loadings as a baselineload together with overcharge variations thereof, produced no significantdamage to any of the guns tested. All seven of the black powder steel shotloads developed were found to be within the safe operating limits of eachof the guns tested. Surmountable problems were encountered in effectingunhampered release of steel shot pellets from the one-piece plastic steelshot wads tested. Insurmountable problems were encountered in seating one-pieceplastic steel shot wads on black powder charges in muzzleloading shotgunscontaining choke configurations of conical or parallel design and constrictionsof any significant degree. Successful patterns were obtained from steelshot in unchoked (cylinder bored) muzzleloaders, but only with a very limitedrange of pellet sizes per firearm.Results indicate that steel shot can be successfully loaded in unchokedmuzzleloading shotguns of modern design, but safety can be absolutely assuredonly in the four specific models subjected to destruction testing. However,steel shot could not be successfully loaded in muzzleloading shotguns containingchoke constrictions, except jug-choked muzzleloaders. If coarse-thread,screw-on choke devices can be developed and marketed for muzzleloaders,then there is a high likelihood that all problems with wad seating in choked,single-barreled muzzleloaders can be resolved. If sufficiently strong,coarse-thread, screw-in choke devices can be developed and marketed formuzzleloaders, then there is a high likelihood that all problems with wadseating in choked, double-barreled muzzleloaders can be resolved. Additionalresearch is necessary if it is desired that black powder steel shot loadingdata and the inventory of tested and proven-safe muzzleloading shotgunmakes and models be expanded. Additional research is also necessary ifit is desired that Pyrodex powder be included in steel shot muzzleloadingdata development efforts.Recently, a survey was conducted by the Service regarding the regulatoryand/or statutory actions that have been taken at the State level with regardto including muzzleloading hunters in the requirement to use nontoxic shotfor waterfowling in nontoxic shot zones. Of the 46 States affected by zoning,approximately 34 currently require muzzleloaders to shoot steel shot innontoxic shot zones. The other 12 States are awaiting further Service actionsand/or will simply adopt the Federal regulations. The results of the loaddevelopment and destructive testing study indicate that some, but probablyfew, hunters will be inconvenienced by this decision. However, it has beendemonstrated that shooting steel shot with some muzzleloaders can be bothsafe and effective.In consideration of the positive results of the study and regulatory/statutoryprocesses of both the States and the Federal government, the Service hasdecided not to delay the implementation of this rule.For a copy of the full report referenced above, please send a request tothe Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Room 536, Matomic Building, Washington, DC 20240.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank Dunkle, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-14835 Filed 6-30-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
