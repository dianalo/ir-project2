By appropriate combination of two X-ray films ofa particular body region, one as a &quot;negative&quot; and the other as a &quot;positive,&quot;the presence of radiographic contrast material in the vascular system,urinary, or biliary tract could be identified. However, the use of relativelyhigh concentrations of radiopaque material provided satisfactory visualizationof these structures by more conventional methods; hence, the developmentof subtraction techniques was not fostered. Thus, although subtractionvisualization has been available for 20 or more years, it has seldombeen utilized until the recent past. The reduction of an image into aseries of quantifiable numerical values vastly expands the potentialfor contrast subtraction techniques. Digital image &quot;inversion ensuresthat areas of exact supraposition are subtracted to a value of zero.Areas of even moderate opacification by contrast agents can be more preciselyidentified and studied in greater detail by digital amplification. Theavailability of relatively inexpensive high capacity, rapid access computerstorage devices has allowed the development of a series of commerciallyavailable systems which may revolutionize contrast valuation of the heartand great vessels in the next decade. Availability of information indigital form allows for innumerable manipulations so as to extract themaximal information therefrom. The capacity of current memory devicesallows for the application of gating techniques which are essential forcardiac applications. The principles and practical application have beendescribed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
