The chamber split generally along party lines as it passed252-159 a ban on any Star Wars tests that would violate the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Later it voted 240-174 to bar spending for any weapons thatwould violate the numerical limits on various categories of atomicweapons contained in the 1979 SALT II treaty. Reagan says theSoviets are violating the unratified pact and thus he will nolonger follow it when deciding which U.S. weapons to build.   The votes came as the Democratic-controlled chamber beganworking on a huge bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for thefiscal year starting Oct. 1.   In effect, the first vote requires Reagan to adhere to theso-called narrow interpretation of the ABM pact, even though thepresident asserts he has the legal right to move to a broad viewthat would allow expanded Star Wars testing.   ``This is unilateral disarmament of a benign, but nonethlessserious, sort,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a critic of the ABMrestricton.   But Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said, ``what we're talking aboutis simply the same intepretation of the ABM treaty that's beentaken by every president since it was ratified.''   Both amendments were added to last year's Pentagon budget billon votes which went largely along party lines. But they were lateraltered during the House-Senate conference committee called to workout differences between the defense bills passed separately by thetwo chambers.   The ABM fight arises from Reagan's contention that he canunilaterally change how a treaty is legally interpreted by theUnited States. Although Reagan has asserted such a right legallyexists, he has chosen not to exercise it.   Congressional Democrats dispute Reagan's assertion, arguing thata treaty cannot be changed without approval of the Senate, whichmust ratify such pacts before they become effective.   The fight has spilled over to the ratification of the separateU.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear forces.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on a 12-7 decision thatgenerally went along party lines, added an amendment banning theINF treaty from being reinterpreted unless the Senate approves.That amendment is expected to be the subject of a major fight whenthe Senate considers ratification next month.   The arms control fights are the first of a series of debatesthat will stretch into next month as the House considers a billauthorizing the budget of the largest single agency in government.   The measure proposes to let the Pentagon spend $299.5 billion inthe next fiscal year, which is slightly less than the $300 billionauthorized in the current budget.   The $299.5 billion figure was set last December as part of theso-called ``budget summit'' between Reagan and congressionalleaders. The overall spending package is designed to reduce federalbudget deficits.   The defense figure was $33 billion less than the Reaganadministration thought it would receive for the Pentagon next year,and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci ordered the services to makemajor budget cuts to meet the lower figure. Among the reductionswere the early retirement of some smaller Navy ships, along withreductions in civilian employment by some of the services.   The bill that passes the House will eventually go to aHouse-Senate conference committee to be reconciled with the measurethat the Senate will approve.   The Senate is proceeding at a slower pace, with its ArmedServices Committee meeting behind closed doors this week to writeits version of the bill.   One major difference is the spending level for the StrategicDefense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for SDI next year, compared with thecurrent $3.9 billion budget. The House measure proposes $4.0billion, although that figure could be changed when the issue isdebated next week. The Senate Armed Services Committee isconsidering $4.6 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
