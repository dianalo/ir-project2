The government acted after negotiations between Canada Post Corp. and its largest union, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, collapsed Wednesday.    The government would like the bill to take effect immediately, but opposition parties are expected to delay its passage until next week. The measure, if passed, may result in an arbitrated settlement.    The bill provides for fines of as much as 50,000 Canadian dollars ($38,295) a day for a union official defying the law, and as much as 1,000 dollars a day for any postal employee.    The union, representing 23,000 postal clerks, mail sorters, and other indoor workers, denounced the proposed back-to-work legislation and said it would escalate its strike action. A spokeswoman said that more than 12,000 members were on strike or locked out yesterday evening, the ninth day of rotating strikes across Canada.    Union leader Jean-Claude Parrot said recently that he hadn't decided whether to abide by back-to-work legislation, if it were passed. Mr. Parrot, who once went to jail for defying a similar law, could face stiff fines and be barred from representing the union for five years if he didn't comply with proposed legislation should it become law.    Under the proposed legislation, a &quot;mediator-arbitrator&quot; would be appointed to settle the dispute. If the appointee is unable to mediate a settlement, he would produce an arbitration award, based on a conciliator's report issued last month.    The conciliator's report supports the major demand of Canada Post -- the ability to franchise some postal operations to the private sector, which is the major issue as far as the union is concerned. The union contends that such a move would result in a big loss of union-covered jobs.    Meanwhile, the socialist New Democratic Party blocked a government bid to have the bill pass through all stages in the House of Commons immediately. Such a procedure requires unanimous consent of all parties.    Robert McGarry, president of the Letter Carriers Union of Canada, said the fines spelled out in the proposed law were the toughest he had ever seen in a back-to-work bill. The letter carriers' 20,000 members began a 21-day rotating strike across Canada last June and July before reaching a mediated settlement with Canada Post.    Mr. McGarry said that in the case of the letter carriers' union, a conciliator's report didn't make any recommendations on controversial issues, making it easier for the mediator to find a consensus. </TEXT></DOC>
