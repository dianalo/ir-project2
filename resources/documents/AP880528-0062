All four men pledged to work together to promote democracythrough ``dialogue and compromise,'' said Chief PresidentialSpokesman Lee Soo-jung.   Lee said the accord was reached during a four-hour meetingbetween Roh, Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, theirfirst such encounter since Roh took office Feb. 25.   The four leaders agreed that South Korea has been moving rapidlytowards democracy since a new constitution was adopted last year,the spokesman said.   The leaders also said South Korea should continue to seekreforms in all sectors and rejected violence as a means to changesociety, Lee said.   All three opposition leaders said the meeting was beneficial.   Kim Dae-jung, head of the largest opposition group, the Partyfor Peace and Democracy, called the meeting ``sincere and frank.''   The 62-year-old Kim said, however, he had failed to get Roh'spromise to free ``all prisoners of conscience.''   Roh said he would set free ``as many political prisoners aspossible'' if they repent but made it clear that it would bedifficult to release ``those who committed serious crimes such asmurder and arson,'' Lee said.   Roh pointed out that 1,275 political offenders had already beenset free under three government amnesties last year and early thisyear.   Government officials said between 250 and 300 people arecurrently in jail, serving terms or awaiting trial for politicaloffense. Dissidents claim the number is much higher.   Roh pledged to reform South Korea's influential state securityapparatus, which has been responsible for arresting many of thepolitical prisoners.   South Korea's intelligence agencies have exerted a stronginfluence on past governments.   As the governing party candidate, Roh defeated the threeopposition leaders last December in South Korea's first directpresidential elections in 16 years. Roh won with only 36.6 percentof the vote.   The elections were called after the government of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan, under mounting public pressure, agreed toopposition demands for sweeping democratic reforms.   A new constitution was subsequently adopted in a nationalreferendum.   The opposition made a strong comeback in legislative electionsin April, stripping Roh's governing party of its parliamentarymajority for the first time in South Korea's 40-year history.   Since the legislative election setback, Roh has promised to workwith the opposition.   The political leaders exchanged views on this fall's OlympicGames in Seoul and agreed to do their best to persuade North Koreato take part in the Games, Lee said. Roh made it clear, however,that it would be impossible to make North Korea a co-host.   North Korea has said it will boycott the Games unless it is madea co-host.   The political leaders also agreed to investigate a 1980 civilinguprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left nearly 200people dead, the spokesman said.   And they agreed to investigate past official corruption, thoughRoh said he hoped any such probes would not include formerPresident Chun, who stepped down at the end of his term in SouthKorea's first peaceful transfer of power.</TEXT></DOC>
