Rail Line Between St. Louis, MO andChicago, IL </ITAG>An environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared for the above-entitledproceeding in which Rio Grande Industries, Southern Pacific TransportationCompany, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad Company, St. LouisSouthwestern Railway Company, and SPCSL Corporation and Daniel R. Murray,Trustee of the Chicago, Missouri andamp; Western Railway Company (CMW) haveapplied for our approval for SPCSL to acquire the CMW rail line betweenEast St. Louis, IL and Chicago, IL. The proposal also includes the creationof a SPCSL-CMW joint facility, access to additional CMW served shippersthrough trackage rights over other railroads, the acquisition of severalCMW branchlines, and two small construction/connection projects betweenexisting rail lines. Applicants and the Trustee maintain that CMW is onthe verge of cashlessness and the CMW system is threatened with an imminentshutdown of rail operations  unless the proposed acquisition is consummated.The Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division hascalled upon the Commission to act on this proposal within thirty days ofthe application, which was filed on August 25, 1989. The EA concludes that the implementation of this proposal will not significantlyaffect the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. Theproposed acquisition is the substitution of a stronger rail operator fora financially-troubled one. Applicants propose to preserve and improverail service with only slight increases in future train activity, whichwill limit potential effects on the quality of the human environment. Theproposed acquisition's insignificant effects were deemed preferable tothe uncertain environmental effects of alternatives where freight and passengerservice could be lost. The EA will be served on all parties of record, and will be sent to thetwenty Federal, state, and local agencies concerned with these matters.Other interested parties may receive copies of the EA upon request fromthe contact listed below. Comments will be considered to the extent allowable by the Bankruptcy Court'srequest for expediency.
