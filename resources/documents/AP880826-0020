(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Connecticut's top Roman Catholic clerichas ended his longtime affiliation with the Democratic Party andreregistered as a Republican because of the Democrats' stances onbirth control and abortion rights.   Archbishop John F. Whealon of Hartford announced his decision toquit the Democratic Party in his weekly column in ``The CatholicTranscript,'' the archdiocesan weekly newspaper appearing Friday.   Whealon didn't say in his column that he had registered as aRepublican, but he made the switch last week, according toofficials in the office of the West Hartford registrar of voters.   Whealon complained the Democratic platform drafted during therecent national convention ``is in favor of contraception andabortion, financed by the government.''   He said the Republican Party platform expressed support for thefamily and opposed abortion.   ``In 1860, the Democratic Party was on the wrong side on themoral question of slavery. It is on the wrong side of the moreserious moral question of abortion. Therefore, reluctantly, I amunable in conscience to remain a registered Democrat. Feelingabandoned, I hope that the Democratic Party regains its moralprinciples and soul,'' the archbishop wrote.   Whealon had been registered as a Democrat in Connecticut since1969.   ``I had no idea what his political affiliation was, and I don'tknow that anyone else did either,'' Democratic State Chairman JohnDroney said Thursday.   ``We're glad to have him aboard,'' said Pauline Kezer, vicechairman of the state Republican Party.</TEXT></DOC>
