Many trading managers lost money because of choppy futures markets last month, said Norwood's president, Jay Klopfenstein. Only 16 of the 84 funds had gains, Mr. Klopfenstein said.    In the first nine months, the funds had an average cumulative gain of 20.4%, Norwood said.    Public commodity funds are pools of money managed by professionals. Limited partnership units, usually priced at about $1,000 each, are offered to investors. </TEXT></DOC>
