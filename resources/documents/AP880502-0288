But prices on world markets fell sharply after the OPECconference ended with no agreement on a proposed 2 percent cut inthe group's oil production.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, West TexasIntermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark crude, dropped 85 cents abarrel to settle at $17.14. Prices for refined products also slid.   Asked by reporters if he thought prices would fall further inresponse to the stalemate, Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said,``I don't see why. I see (market) fundamentals improving.''   He was referring to projections that oil demand in the mainindustrialized countries will pick up this summer, relieving someof the downward pressure on prices.   Nazer also said he was optimistic about gaining more cooperationfrom non-OPEC oil exporters, including American oil-producingstates.   ``The oil states in the United States are very, very muchinterested in the stabilization of the market,'' he said.   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission thatregulates that state's oil industry, held talks with Nazer andother OPEC officials last week in Vienna.   Hance told them Texas wanted to ``open a dialogue'' with the oilcartel, despite Washington's refusal to take such a step.   Nazer and Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, toldseparate news conferences that the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries was not worried by short-term reactions in theoil market.   ``Our concern is not what happened ... on Monday or Tuesday butwhat happens to prices in the medium or long term,'' al-Sabah said.   At its current oil production rate of about 17.5 million barrelsa day, OPEC stands to lose $122 million a week for each $1 drop inprices.   Nazer said his government was confident that prices willstabilize near OPEC's target of $18 a barrel in the longer term.   ``We wouldn't pay any attention to short-term gyrations,'' hesaid.   The OPEC oil ministers had come to Vienna hoping to reachagreement with a group of six independent oil-producing nations onmutual export reductions.   The non-OPEC group _ Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Angola andMalaysia _ offered to cut exports by 5 percent, or about 200,000barrels a day, if OPEC did likewise.   OPEC member Algeria proposed that the cartel cut its output by300,000 barrels a day, or about 2 percent, in order to establish abasis for a more formal relationship with the rival producers.   But Saudi Arabia, backed by Kuwait, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates, blocked the proposal, saying OPEC should take more timeto consider a response.   Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti minister, told reporters OPEC also shouldclear up some internal problems before deciding on new methods ofcooperation with other producers.   He said the lack of agreement within OPEC on such technicalissues as how to ensure compliance with oil production quotas madeany new agreements on production cuts meaningless.   ``We all realized that the extent of the problem is much greaterthan just cutting'' output now by a token amount, he said.   He said an OPEC committee would study the technical issuesbefore the next ministerial conference, set for June 8.   Also, a separate OPEC committee of five oil ministers is to holdbilateral and group meetings with the six non-OPEC countries priorto June, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
