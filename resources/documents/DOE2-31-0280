Short term incentives explained are reduced excess airand unburned carbon, ash friability, increased vanadium content in flyash, stack gas gains and losses, and direct costs. Longer term benefitsare described under the following headings: furnace cleaning, alternativefuel purchase, and load cut back.</TEXT></DOC>
