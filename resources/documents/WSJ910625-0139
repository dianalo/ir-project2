The latest marketing gambit is to try to shore up thewaning Winston franchise by unveiling in mid-August apackaging &quot;breakthrough&quot; that the company claims will givesmokers the freshest cigarettes in the tobacco industry. Butit's an open question whether puffers will warm to Reynolds'sunorthodox selling proposition, since they seldom encounterstale cigarettes, anyway.</LP><TEXT>   The pitch marks the first attempt in recent years to sella full-price cigarette brand by playing up packaging ratherthan such features as flavor and imagery. Cut-price &quot;generic&quot;brands, which have stolen millions of customers from standardsmokes, have begun plying an image-conscious message,blurring their distinction from full-price brands.   The company's tobacco merchants are touting the packaginginnovation and an accompanying ad campaign as the centerpieceof a quality drive to stem sharp sales declines in Winston,which was America's best-selling cigarette until 1974.   The brand has sustained an accelerating exodus as itstraditional loyalists have traded down to discount smokes,kicked the habit or died off. Last year, Winston's marketshare totaled 8.8%, down 1.9 percentage points since 1988 andfar behind the Marlboro man's industry-leading 26% share.   Over the past 18 months, the company has spent $30 millionon better tobacco blends for Winston. It also bought brighterwrapping paper for cartons and even darkened the Winstonprint on each cigarette as a visual cue of freshness forconsumers. As well, Reynolds has packed more tobacco intoeach Winston so that the &quot;puff count&quot; -- the measure of howlong a cigarette takes to be fully smoked -- has risen morethan 10%.   For the moment, tobacco rivals are content to watch theWinston experiment from the sidelines. Several say theycontemplated using technology comparable to that adopted byReynolds, but nixed the idea after finding consumers wereindifferent. &quot;Philip Morris has no freshness problems withits products, so we don't see this as an issue for us,&quot; saysa Philip Morris Cos. spokesman. &quot;For every five million packsof cigarettes the company sells, we get one complaint ofstaleness.&quot;   A number of industry experts also question whether thelatest packaging initiative will do much more for Winstonthan slow the mass defection from the brand. &quot;This is abrand-maintenance idea, but it isn't a brand-building idea,&quot;says Kevin Leibel, vice president of marketing for Cato Gobe,a New York-based marketing and design consultant. &quot;If thebrand didn't have a motivating taste in the first place, willa fresher non-motivating taste be more persuasive?&quot;   Nonetheless, Mr. Leibel approves of the tactic as a meansto keep current Winston smokers in the fold. &quot;Full-pricebrands need to distinguish themselves from their lessexpensive cousins, and creating tangible benefits is oneexcellent way to achieve that goal.&quot;   By encasing packs of Winston in its proprietary aluminumpolyester overwrap called &quot;FlavorSeal,&quot; Reynolds claims itsNo. 2-ranked brand will remain fresh three times as long assmokes from rivals. The notion is to give consumers aconsistent-tasting cigarette that comes much closer toapproximating the taste of a Winston fresh from the tobaccoplant.   The polyester packaging, which has been used in snackfoods, candy wrappers and other food products throughout the'80s, is said by Winston to be 10 times better as a moisturebarrier than the industry's standard polypropylene outerwrapand 1,000 times better as an air barrier.   The hope is the move will give Winston smokers acompelling reason to stick with their full-price brand, whileconverting occasional Winston smokers into die-hards. Winstonis the most frequently picked cigarette when people can'tfind their regular brand.   &quot;We're dealing with a marketplace with multiple pricing,and we have to continue to add more value to full pricebrands like Winston,&quot; says David N. Iauco, senior vicepresident of marketing at RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc.'s tobaccounit. &quot;This is a way of adding significant value for oursmokers, and we believe this gives us a competitive edge.&quot;   But Reynolds must succeed in generating consumerexcitement for a benefit that most smokers have never craved.Since industry practice is to pick up outdated goods fromwholesalers, consumer complaints about overtly stalemerchandise are a rarity. (Reynolds picks up its cigarettesfrom distributors after about nine months and says it won'talter that policy, despite the Winston innovation.)   Moreover, when smokers do switch brands on the basis offreshness, they seldom realize what lies behind their suddendissatisfaction. They just think their standard smoke hasbecome too harsh.   At the Jabel Yaffa Smoke Shop in Queens, N.Y., mostsmokers show scant enthusiasm for Winston's advance. &quot;Theidea doesn't sell me,&quot; says Gabriel DeSilva, an auto mechanicand a two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker. &quot;I can't tell thedifference between a fresh cigarette and a stale cigarette.&quot;Echoes Chris Rudtke, a New York Telephone employee, who alsosmokes Marlboro: &quot;I have no problem with freshness.Cigarettes all taste the same, no matter how long they sit onthe shelf.&quot;   Reynolds executives concede that Winston's packagingwasn't a response to any consumer clamor. In the mid-'80s,however, Winston did develop a quality problem that somesmokers became aware of. It stemmed from Reynolds's status asthe biggest practitioner of a controversial industry practiceknown as trade loading. The practice, which involved shippingtoo many cartons of cigarettes for distributors to sell overa given period of time, inflated sales and resulted inReynolds having to take back huge quantities of stale productfrom wholesalers.   Reynolds eliminated trade loading in 1989 and wound uptaking a $360 million hit to operating profit. In theaftermath of the loading debacle, the company claims itscigarettes have been a month fresher than those of rivalsbecause its shipments are more representative of consumerdemand.   Still, company executives take issue with the prevailingindustry belief that they are making much ado about verylittle. They insist their research shows that consumers areenthusiastic about the forever-young Winstons -- once thesmokers actually sample the cigarettes. So, even moreimportant than the new ad campaign -- which is Winston'sfourth in just seven years -- the tobacco marketer plans tounleash a barrage of promotional activity aimed at generatingconsumer trial.   &quot;The key to the strategy is to get Winston into smokers'hands,&quot; says James W. Johnston, Reynolds's chairman and chiefexecutive officer. He adds that if the Winston effort provessuccessful, the package technology will be applied to otherbrands.   Despite the skepticism of many puffers, some are eagerlyawaiting the new Winstons. Frank Smeal is a Marlboro smoker,who trades off to Winston once a week for a change of pace.&quot;I've bought a lot of stale packs of Marlboro and wound upgetting stiffed for $2.25,&quot; the New York construction workersays. &quot;If Winstons are guaranteed fresh, why not switch?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
