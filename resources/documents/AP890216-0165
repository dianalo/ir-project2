Rebel soldiers, meanwhile, continued to attack cities held bygovernment troops. Rockets fired into two cities killed at least 12people, radio and Afghan Foreign Ministry reports said.   The attacks came one day after the last Soviet troops pulled outof the country, ending a nine-year intervention.   Also Thursday, Radio Kabul said 600 troops from Pakistan, whichsupports the guerrillas, marched on an Afghan city on Feb. 10.   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarsaid Thursday he was considering Afghanistan's request for U.N.border outposts to check the flow of U.S. and Pakistani arms toAfghan rebels.   But he declined to say whether the U.S. supply of arms to therebels violates the April 14 agreement signed in Geneva thatresulted in the Soviet troop withdrawal.   Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army willbe unable to prevent Kabul and other major Afghan cities from beingtaken by Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Soviet forces are gone.   Leaders of Afghan guerrilla factions based in neighboringPakistan and Iran are meeting here to try and reach a consensus onforming a new government that will encompass their disparate views.   The Pakistan-based Afghan National Liberation Front rebel groupreturned to the council Thursday after a two-day boycott because``we cannot do much by remaining outside,'' said group spokesmanZabihullah Mojaddidi.   On Wednesday, guerrilla leaders put a plan for a provisionalgovernment before the 400-member council. Mojaddidi said theproposal is incomplete and ``we don't believe it should be discussedat this stage.''   The National Liberation Front boycotted the shura after itsproposal for allowing Afghans living in Iran to take part in the newgovernment was rejected by the other leaders of the seven-memberguerrilla alliance based in Pakistan.   The role of the Iran-based rebels has been turned over to aspecial commission.   Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for eight Iran-based guerrillaparties, said Thursday his group will not accept the decisions ofthe commission because it isn't a part of it.   Most of the rebels based in Pakistan are Sunni Moslems and mostof the Afghans based in Iran are Shiite Moslems. The majority ofAfghanistan's 15 million people are Sunni Moslems.   In Kabul, six civilians, including three children, were killedwhen rockets blasted residential areas of Kabul, an Afghan ForeignMinistry spokesman said.   Mohammad Badakhshi, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in theattack, asked, ``Who is doing this?''   ``I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind,'' he toldreporters.   Ghazni city, about 105 miles south of Kabul, also was hit byrockets that killed six, reported Radio Kabul.   The state-controlled radio blamed criminial extremists,presumably referring to anti-communsit rebels.   Radio Kabul also charged Pakistani troops were sent into Ghaznito ``carry out terrorist activities.'' Ghazni is about 90 miles westof the Pakistan border.   Some of the 600 Pakistani soldiers were deployed to the garrisontown of Urgun in eastern Paktika province, the radio broadcastclaimed.   The Pakistan government has denied crossing into Afghanistan tosupport the rebels.   Radio Kabul said 34 guerrillas were killed in fighting Wednesdayand Thursday.   In New York on Thursday, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil saidhis government asked the United Nations to set up outposts along theAfghan-Pakistan border to halt the flow of arms to guerrillas.   Perez de Cuellar was noncommittal.``I am considering this,'' hesaid.   The United Nations has about 50 observers in Afghanistan andPakistan to monitor compliance with the U.N.-mediated agreement.   The U.N. chief also was asked whether U.S. aid to the rebels wasa violation of the pact. ``This is a subject which I intend todiscuss with American authorities when I meet them,'' he said,referring to his trip to Washington on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
