However, just ascarp adapted to Lake Erie's polluted waters, so the fouledSoviet economic system has produced an adaptive subspecies ofscientists and engineers with qualities needed by U.S.industry. Two features of the &quot;polluted&quot; landscape of Sovietscience are worth examining: scarcity and lack of economicdiscipline.   There is nothing like shortages, obsolete equipment andpoor-quality raw materials to stimulate the mind. Thedisparity between the high level of technical human capitaland the low level of physical infrastructure has produced aresourceful scientific and engineering community. Itsachievements have been stimulated by the need not only tocompete with the West militarily, but to solve problemswithout the benefit of ready access to the most up-to-dateequipment and materials. This culture of deprivation hasproduced its own socialist style &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The T-34 tank of World War II fame and the Kalashikovrifle of today are symbols of Soviet applied technology atits competitive best -- simple, rugged, effective andcomparatively cheap to make. In a society that is not used tofrills, &quot;the basics&quot; dominate design decisions. Based on anAmerican design, the T-34 got Russified: The design wassimplified for Soviet manufacturing conditions, its mobility,armor protection and firepower improved. But the finishingwas rough; welded joints were left unpolished and firecontrol was not user-friendly. Two of the T-34's mostimportant features -- good track design and optimally slopedarmor -- depended on nothing more sophisticated than penciland paper together with some good mathematics.   By contrast, &quot;technological sophistication&quot; has been theholy grail for decades in the U.S. Cheap and simple solutionsdo not generate much enthusiasm -- especially in thegovernment-funded world of technology push. Much of U.S.technical culture has been driven by the Defense Department'shuge Randamp;D budgets with its &quot;maximum performance&quot; mentality --which often translates into &quot;maximum cost.&quot; These attitudesinfluence other parts of America's business and engineeringculture.   The &quot;most sophisticated&quot; has falsely become associatedwith &quot;the best.&quot; It is the rich man's disease. Take the caseof Arthur Schnitt, an Aerojet engineer who in 1961 devised acheap and simple way to build the Saturn V moon rocket thatwould have saved the taxpayer millions of dollars. He arguedthat if the Saturn were designed not to use maximumperformance hydrogen fuel, it could be built much morecheaply. His proposal came to be known as Big Dumb Booster.Schnitt's idea threatened thousands of jobs linked to anexpensive &quot;high-tech&quot; approach and was treated as heresy.   The Soviet approach to design, at its best, is akin to thegeneric grocery store. Forget the frills. Focus only on whatis necessary for the basic mission. Sugar tastes no worse ina brown bag than in one with pretty wrapping.   Paradoxically, the technical solutions emerging from asociety with no commercial competition are of growinginterest to Western firms precisely because they do offercompetitive advantages. These advantages are rooted in the&quot;weaknesses&quot; of the system: an abundance of creative mindsthat are not &quot;disciplined&quot; to think about short-term marketconsiderations, primitive working conditions and inadequateequipment. All of these shortcomings do hurt. They contributeto low productivity, waste and the manufacture of productspeople don't want.   Yet hidden in this failed system is a &quot;use-what-you-have&quot;approach that can yield tremendous competitive benefits, putinto the right hands. &quot;What they have&quot; is very well trained,mathematically oriented engineers and experimentalists.Solutions with high ratios of brainware to hardware meansophisticated results using simple cheap equipment -- aninvestor's dream.   Lack of Western-style Randamp;D discipline is behind some of thesignificant science intensive accomplishments of the Sovietsin recent years. Western companies fund research based on anexpected &quot;return&quot; over a defined period of time. More thanfive years is long term for most companies, and only thelargest can afford these time horizons. For better or worse,Soviet scientists have been largely free of such pressures.They function more in the spirit of academic inquiry, wherecuriosity and intellectual interest, not &quot;markets&quot; or&quot;return&quot; is the driving force. As a result, Soviet scientistsoften solve difficult problems by virtue of scientificperseverance.   For example, RCA researchers gave up on tacitrons in the1950s. These are vacuum-tube-like gas switches that functionas both power sources and rectifiers in harsh andhigh-temperature environments where solid state electronicsfail. Soviet researchers devoted an additional 20 years tothe subject, solving difficult problems in low-temperatureplasma physics. They now have the world's only workinglaboratory prototypes. Their devices have recently beenpurchased by the U.S. government for space powerapplications.   The creative result of this combination of materialscarcity on the one hand, and &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;laxity&quot; on theother, has been demonstrated in the field of advanced ceramictechnology, most widely known in the U.S. forsuperconductivity. Powder is required to make bulksuperconducting components. The high cost of the powder, $125to $500 per pound, is one reason for the high cost ofsuperconducting products and their limited market today.   In the Soviet Union, high-quality powders are made by aprocess known as &quot;self-propagating high-temperaturesynthesis.&quot; Made without the furnaces in which Americanproducers fire their raw materials for days to becomesuperconducting, these Soviet powders are made in seconds insimple plastic reactors. They can be ignited with a match.All the energy for the reaction is provided by the internalchemical energy released by a controlled self-burningprocess. Underlying this &quot;simple&quot; technology are 30 years ofscientific investigation.   Ironically, if &quot;perestroika&quot; succeeds, the technical worldwill be poorer. If the Soviet Union really does become morelike the West, world engineering will lose a significant bitof cultural diversity reared to the adaptive requirements ofMarxist-Leninism. In today's atmosphere of ideologicalself-congratulation, thinking people should look closely atthis &quot;failed&quot; system for its positive lessons beforeassigning it to the ash can of history.   ---   Mr. Kiser is president of Kiser Research, a Washington,D.C., technology transfer company.</TEXT></DOC>
