(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mac CAD Takes OffandM;The time has passed when the Mac could be dismissed as a design andengineering light-weight.andP;  The potent processing speed of the Mac II line wasone key to the change.andP;  Another key was the general acceptance of graphicaluser interfaces.andP;  Although some users of CAD (computer-aided design) systemsturned to the Mac for its own merits, others -- more wedded to IBMcompatibility -- hesitated at first but finally switched to the Mac after PCand workstation CAD heavyweights such as Autodesk, Versacad, Schlumberger,and Intergraph introduced Mac products.andP;  Couple this with the wide variety ofmidrange choices such as Claris CAD -- the most popular Mac CAD package --and it's clearly time for the next generation of Mac CAD software to takeoff.andM;And it has.andP;  Mac programs that look like yesterday's workstation or PC stuffare obsolete.andP;  Old and new CAD developers are busy making CAD easier to useand more comprehensive, extending its reach back to conceptualization andforward to manufacturing, testing, and presentation.andP;  They're linking CAD toother programs, stretching it to fit work groups, and customizing it forparticular industries.andP;  In a world obsessed with &quot;time to market&quot; and &quot;designfor manufacturability&quot; (creating products that are easy to manufactureefficiently), Mac-wielding designers and engineers need to squeeze every gramof power from their CAD packages.andP;  Five trends in Macintosh CAD that willsave you design time and prevent redesign headaches are intelligentinterfaces, integration with other products, multiuser and multiplatformcapabilities, specialty CAD, and 3-D drawing.andP;  You'll find these trends bothin new versions of old favorities and in some new programs that are chartingpreviously unexplored CAD territory.andM;Intelligent DraftingandM;The Mac's interface of windows, icons, and cut-and-paste graphics is centralto its CAD success.andP;  Some early programs didn't stick to the Mac interfacestandard, but now most do, building on a MacDraw-style foundation withpalettes of basic drawing shapes accompanying pull-down menus of commands andoptions.andP;  (Autodesk's AutoCAD is a clear exception, persisting with the vetyunMac-like menus and conventions that it sports on the PC.)andP;  But even the Macinterface can get confusing when you must choose from among a couple of dozenbasic objects, half a dozen drawing methods for each object, and ten or moresnapping options for each combination of object and method.andP;  The welter ofpull-down, pull-out, and pull-up menus; icons; palettes; Command-keycombinations; and mouse clicks can hinder, instead of help, the movement ofideas from mind to screen.andM;But Mac CAD programs are getting smarter.andP;  Several new programs fightcomplexity by adding intelligence to the interface.andP;  Instead of making youfind the right combination of object, method, and position, these programsanticipate intentions and offer suggestions.andP;  Engineered Software's PowerDraw3.0 has a Dynamic Snap Indicator -- a small strip of letters on the drawingwindow's title bar that indicates when a particular dynamic snap point hasbeen located.andP;  (A snap point is a location at which the software completes orfine-tunes a drawing or relationship that hasn't yet been completely orprecisely drawn, based on its assumptions about the user's intentions.)andP;  Forexample, a C indicates a center snap, an E an end snap, and a % a percentageof distance along a line-segment snap.andM;Ashlar's Vellum goes beyond this, setting the pace for interface intelligencewith an ever-vigilant Drafting Assistant that watches the active tool, thegeometry already on-screen, and the cursor's location.andP;  It then processesthese observations and its own knowledge base of common constructions througha &quot;geometric inference engine&quot; to determine what you might want to do next.andO;Messages such as &quot;endpoint,&quot; &quot;intersect,&quot; &quot;align,&quot; and &quot;quadrant&quot; appearbeside the cursor as it approaches such points on the drawing.andP;  You caneither draw to these points or ignore the messages.andP;  Ashlar is patenting thistechnology, which could also be used in other applications, such as desktoppublishing.andM;Vellum also features another exciting trend in Mac CAD: parametic drawing.andP;  Aparametric feature can automatically &quot;resolve&quot; a drawing by resizing andpositioning objects to fit a set of constraints.andP;  For instance, you can drawa rectangle in Vellum, label one side A and an adjacent side B, give A alength of 2 inches, enter the equation B = A*3.5, and choose the Resolvecommand.andP;  Vellum will redraw the rectangle by retaining its 90-degreecorners, keeping A at 2 inches, and stretching B and the opposite side to 7inches (see Figure 1).andP;  Parametric constraints can include a variety of otherobject attributes as well.andP;  Parametric technology is already popular inworkstation and PC CAD programs for quickly creating families of parts from afundamental design, for exploring what-if possibilities while sketching apart, and for keeping a design within certain boundaries determined by spaceand material demands.andP;  Vellum is the first program to bring parametrics tothe Mac, and along with its intelligent assistant, Vellum has taken the CADinterface to a new level of ease of use.andM;Claris CAD 2.0, which should be out by the time you read this, takesassistance a step further.andP;  Its &quot;graphic guide&quot; not only anticipates probabledrawing operations but also automatically chooses a modifier (drawing method)that makes sense for the cursor's present position within a drawing.andP;  TheGuide has a Preview function that changes the cursor to show which modifieris active and how an object will be drawn.andP;  It also has a Guideliner functionthat displays alignment marks when the cursor is between objects.andP;  UnlikeVellum's assistant, this Guide doesn't display text messages about the cursorposition, instead relying on icon messages.andP;  It also differs from Vellum inthat it's sensitive to cursor speed: The Guide ignores the cursor when it'smoving quickly because it assumes that a fast cursor motion is a move acrossthe screen rather than a search for a drawing point.andM;Integrated CADandM;Mac CAD software is reaching out to other Mac software to share information.andO;Design doesn't mean just drawing pictures; it means organizing and directingall the geometric and textual information that describes a component orproduct.andP;  Sophisticated CAD packages link a database of textual informationto the drawing image -- information such as materials properties, partscosts, and assembly processes.andP;  Historically this approach has appeared as areport or BOM (bill of materials) in mechanical and architectural CADprograms.andP;  A BOM details the parts that make up a drawing; changes in thedrawing are reflected in the next BOM extraction.andM;But textual information can also be linked in the other direction, withchanges in the text affecting the drawing.andP;  (This is how parametric drawingworks, as in Vellum's Resolve command.)andP;  Currently, there are several ways tocreate this link -- through a built-in database, through an externaldatabase, or through HyperCard.andP;  When System 7 appears, another way willopen: the new IAC (interapplication communication) capability that willprovide for direct links between numerous different programs.andP;  Claris, forexample, is planning to use the IAC ability of System 7 to integrate avariety of its programs, from MacWrite II and MacProject II to FileMaker IIand Claris CAD.andM;Intergraph's MicroStation works not only with other Macintosh programs butalso with minicomputer and mainframe data through built-in routines that linkto Oracle's database manager.andP;  You must buy Oracle separately and then linkthe two programs to see the MicroStation database commands.andP;  Any object inMicroStation can be attached to a database field.andP;  You can use SQL commandsor Oracle's HyperCard front end to query the database.andM;Versacad took the HyperCard route with its CAD program, linking anobject-oriented database to the drawing through stacks and HyperTalk scripts.andO;Graphsoft added an integrated database -- in the form of a spreadsheet -- toits venerable MiniCAD drafting package.andP;  The spreadsheet contains objectsize, along with hierarchical class and name identities that MiniCad+ assignsto objects.andP;  There are built-in formulas for engineering calculations as wellas commands for manipulating, formatting, and printing cell information.andO;MiniCAD+ also has a macro language, MiniPascal, for more-complex analyses.andM;Aperture from Aperture Technologies is touted as a &quot;visual-informationmanager&quot; that does more than draw.andP;  This emphasis on teamwork between drawingand database management shows up immediately when you start the program:After the File and Edit menus comes a menu for graphics (Drawing) and anotherfor database management (Data).andP;  Any object within a drawing may have anattached database record (see Figure 2).andP;  Aperture can search through adrawing via the database, highlighting the corresponding graphic parts orlabeling drawing elements from database records.andP;  There is a complete list ofdatabase commands, from searching and sorting to reporting.andP;  Aperture alsolets you assign Link Buttons to any object in a drawing: Click on the button,and a specified view of another drawing appears in its own window.andM;CAD GroupwareandM;Mac CAD is also becoming more social.andP;  Design is sometimes a group process inwhich drawings and information must be shared over a network, but mostMacintosh CAD programs still don't make any special provisions for networkeddesign groups.andP;  These prorams can run on a network, but they don't let youserve drawing information up to more than one Mac simultaneously.andM;Few CAD programs can freely and transparently provide information to manycomputers -- Macs, PCs, and workstations -- on the same network.andP;  VersaCAD,on the other hand, uses the same database for its Mac, PC, and workstationversions.andP;  The VersaLINK translator moves VersaCAD and other CAD files amongthese platforms.andM;Schlumberger's MacBRAVO! can integrate with Bravo3 running on a VAX.andP;  Severalusers on a network can share CAD database files in MacBRAVO!, using differentmodules to create their own designs on separate layers.andP;  Similarly, AutoCAD'spopularity has made its DXF file format a de facto industry standard on thePC, alongside the more official IGES file format.andP;  VersaCAD, AutoCAD, andMicroStation run on PCs, Macs, and workstations, allowing different computerson a network to access each other's file.andP;  And AutoCAD and MicroStation filesdon't need any translation to move from one system to the next because theyare binary-compatible across all the platforms.andM;MicroStation is the front-runner for designers working in groups (see Figure3).andP;  It can swap files with MicroStation running on PCs or UNIX workstationsand can communicate with Intergraph's VAX-based IGDS (Interactive GraphicsDesign Software).andP;  MicroStation also employs read-only &quot;reference&quot; files asbackground layers that can be used by all work groups on a network.andP;  Up to 32reference files -- which can be viewed but not altered by anyone else on thenetwork -- can be attached to each of the 63 levels in a design.andP;  These filescan show design changes as they occur on every participating platform.andO;Reference files save storage space and allow parallel and cooperative designefforts on a network.andM;Specialty CADandM;General-purpose MAc CAD packages have been pressed into every conceivabledesign pursuit, including architectural, electrical, mechanical, andorganizational applications.andP;  If a CAD program is popular enough, it may evenattract is own marketplace of add-on templates, routines, extensions, andparts libraries.andP;  But a general-purpose program cannot contain all thefeatures and commands demanded by different disciplines without becoming amonstrous lumber room of menus and icons.andP;  Even with templates andextensions, a general-purpose program can't match the specialized interface,terminology, and style of the common practice of a particular field.andM;Specialized programs are often more expensive, however, because they cater toa smaller market.andP;  Instead of paying $700 for a general-purpose packae thatdoes 80 to 90 percent of what you want, you may have to drop $3,000 or morefor a specialty program that can go the extra 5 or 10 percent.andP;  There aremany from which to choose.andP;  The Mac is home to a growing variety ofspecialized CAD programs for every sort of design, from buildings to boats toboxes to circuit boards, many of which are reflected in the product directoryat the end of this article.andM;Since architects make up approximately 40 percent of Mac CAD users,architecture has prompted the creation of the most specialty tools, rangingfrom overall-design tools to structural-analysis, landscape-layout, andrendering packages.andP;  Add-ons, such as AutoArchitect from DCA EngineeringSoftware and Architosh from E.T.andP;  Vermurlen andamp; Associates, can tailor ageneral-purpose program for architectural work.andP;  AutoArchitect extendsAutoCAD, adding tools for editing in plan, elevation, and three dimensions;programs for automating the design of walls, roofs, windows, foundations, andstairs; symbol libraries with plumbing, electrical, furniture, and otherappropriate symbols; and a project-scheduling program.andP;  Architosh is a set of2,000 architectural symbols for VersaCAD, grouped in libraries forlandscaping; floor plans; elevations; and mechanical, electrical, and otherpurposes.andP;  VersaCAD offers its own add-on, VersaCAD Architect, that tailorsthat general-purpose program for architecture.andP;  Engineered Software sellsLandscape and Residential Construction symbol libraries for PowerDraw.andO;MiniReporter from Valle Anderson Associates generates design-project reportsfrom MiniCAD+ drawings.andP;  The Engineering Symbols Library from NorthstarEngineering Design works with any Mac CAD package that handles PICT orMacDraw images.andM;There are also programs built from ground up for architecture.andP;  Gimeor'sArchitrion II is a 3-D-CAD package for every phase of architectural design,from creating the schematic through planing and designing working drawings toobtaining building permits.andP;  It offers a different metaphor forconceptualization than do most CAD programs.andP;  Where general-purpose designprograms create and place drawing primitives, Architrion creates and anglesvolumes -- an approach that attracts some and baffles others (see Figure 4).andO;Architrion also offers features that are limited or lacking ingeneral-purpose packages, such as the ability to generate 3-D perspectivesand cros sections, calculate building and room areas, and simulate shading(shadow-casting) and lighting from a light source.andP;  Gimeor's separateArchiMovie program can animate scenes from Architrion for presentations.andM;ArchiCAD from Graphisoft offers a nearly identical set of features, workingwith plans, elevations, and sections in the terms architects expects from apalette of slabs, roofs, and walls.andP;  Like Architrion, it has a comprehensiveBOM feature -- a database connection that's vital in architecture -- formanaging materials and analyzing the cost of a design.andP;  Unlike withArchitrion, however, you work in two dimensions and extrude for 3-D effects,although ArchiCAD models solids and procedures true cross sections.andM;Electrical and electronic engineering is another big slice of the Mac CADpie.andP;  There are specialized programs for sketching, detailing, analyzing,simulating, and manufacturing electrical and electronic circuits and devices.andO;The sketching and detailing can be done with general-purpose programs, andthere are symbol libraries and add-ons for electronic work, just as there arefor architectural tasks.andP;  For example, Imagine That's Extend can simulatemany different types of systems, including electrical circuits.andP;  It lets youlink logical boxes with defined behavior (such as A/D converters andamplifiers) into block diagrams on-screen and then tells you how the entirediagrammed system will act.andP;  And Compu-Arch's ADS-MGMStation--Electronics,for instance, offers 15 libraries of electromechanical and electronic symbolsfor MGMStation.andP;  But for all the steps from analysis to manufacture, only thededicated programs will do.andM;BV Engineering makes a dozen circuit-analysis programs; Capilano Computing'sDesignWork is an integrated schematic-diagram and digital-logic simulator;San Juan Software's MacAC is an analog-circuit simulator; Nedrud DataSystems' DragonWave helps analyze and optimize microwave circuits.andP;  Both Vampand Douglas Electronics offer software for translating finishedlogical-circuit designs into physical designs -- as layouts for printedcircuit boards (see Figure 5).andP;  Douglas can even manufacture prototype boardsdirectly from Mac files.andM;Some other fields don't have the number of CAD programs you'll find forarchitects or electronic engineers, but they still posses Mac specialties.andO;Textco sells The DNA Inspector IIe for people who work with bio-chemistry andDNA sequencing.andP;  Cambridge Scientific Computing's ChemDraw helps chemistscreate and manipulate molecular models.andP;  ModaCAD sells a powerful series offashion-design programs.andM;Innovative Design Systems' Ovation VAD/CAM is a packaging CAD programs.andP;  Itopens with a design interface that offers the standard configurations of linestyles and bridging patterns for packaging.andP;  Its CAM portion can send theresult to plotters, routers, or commercial laser systems.andP;  Graphic Magic'sMacSurf is a 3-D surface-modeling program for marine design.andP;  MacSurf offersmodules for designing and analyzing the hull on anything from a supertankerto a dinghy.andP;  Neither its commands nor its links to other marine-analysisprgraoms can be found in any general-purpose package.andP;  MacSurf is also usedfor aerospace and automative design.andM;3-D Surfaces and SolidsandM;Many new and old Mac CAD programs are showing another side--reaching to thethree dimensions.andP;  Most CAD is two-dimensional, and most MAC users still workin 2-D--even though real-world objects are 3-D.andP;  Few Mac design programs havecatered directly to 3-D design until recently because 2-D programs can tacklemany problems and the complexity of 3-D calculations slows processingconsiderably.andP;  But the arrival of the Mac IIci and IIfx has decongested theprocessing bottleneck.andP;  (If you don't have a high-end CPU, check out theMacUser Labs report on accelerators in this issue.)andP;  And the push in industrytoward &quot;design for manufacturability&quot; is making 3-D more necessary.andP;  Seeingthe model in the most realistic form as soon as possible reduces the numberof late changes and fixed needed in a design.andM;The world of three dimensions includes programs aimed at 3-D drafting(MiniCAD+, MacBRAVO!, and MicroStation Mac), 3-D conceptualization (such asSuper 3D from Silicon Beach and Paracomp's Swivel 3D), 3-D surface modeling(such as DynaWare's DynaPerspective, shown in Figure 6), and solids modeling(such as DesignCAD--formerly called Origins--from the company of the same newname, and Infinite Graphics' IN-CAD).andP;  Some of the drafting packages includesurface-and solids-rendering features.andP;  Some modeling programs -- such asDesignCAD -- contain many drafting features.andP;  There are even specialized 3-Dpackages for architecture, such as ArchiCAD and Architrion.andP;  Paracomp'sModelShop is a 3-D surface modeler for architectural conceptualization.andO;MacInterior, from Microspot, is an interior-design and space-planning tool.andO;DynaPerspective is a 3-D conceptualizing program that not only offersprimitives and editing tools for creating static models but can also animatemodels for fly-by or walk-through sequences.andP;  VIDI's Dimensions 3DProducerhas similar features for animation.andM;DesignCAD Macintosh is compatible with A/UX and includes real-time rotationability and sophisticated shading for a lower price than that of many 2-Ddrafting programs.andP;  Swivel 3D can constrain the motion of 3-D models tosimulate real mechanical models more accurately.andP;  For example, a model of arobot arm can be restricted to those motions that the arm's joints allow.andM;IN-CAD, from Infinite Graphics, builds its solid modeling on CSG(Constructive Solid Geometry).andP;  Where 3-D surface-modeling software doesn'tunderstand the volume that objects occupy, CSG does.andP;  This means, forinstance, that IN-CAD can quickly calculate the mass properties of a design,such as the center of gravity and the moment of inertia.andP;  IN-CAD models arealso in great shape to transfer to CAM (computer-aided manufacturing)programs because they already contain information about volume.andP;  InfiniteGraphics is the first Mac CAD supplier to promise a direct connectiono to itsDesktop Manufacturing module, a link from IN-CAD to one of the new machinesthat can directly cut, laser-cure, or sinter (melt) a 3-D prototype part fromthe Macintosh CAD file.andP;  Also, with IN-CAD the designer can check forinterference between parts and for the fit between them, something surfacemodeling does not easily allow.andM;But solids modeling demands more work from the processor than does surfacemodeling, so anyone interested in a quick animation of a model might preferDynaPerspective to IN-CAD.andP;  The rendering abilities of surface-andsolids-modeling packages may be standardized in accordance with the new PixarMacRenderMan specification.andP;  Intergraph's MicroStation Mac and Paracomp'sSwivel 3D will support MacRenderMan, for example.andP;  Standardization will makeit easier to move rendered images from one program to another, as inmultimedia presentation created in programs such as MacroMind DirectorInteractive.andM;Choice CAD ChoicesandM;You may not get all you want in a single CAD package.andP;  Architects, forinstance, might like the third-party market around AutoCAD; appreciate thearchitectural foundation and focus of Architrion II; lust after theintelligent interface of Vellum; thrill to the animations of DynaPerspective;and dream of the seamless network with PCs, Macs, and workstations thatMicroStation Mac offers.andM;Other disciplines will have similar wish lists -- wanting the best ofmainstream packages and innovative programs.andP;  For now you can either stickwith one program or cobble together a system from several components -- suchas using Vellum for initial sketching, MicroStation Mac for final drafting,and DynaPerspective for animating a presentation.andP;  Vellum and MicroStationalso make a good team, embodying most of the cutting-edge trends in MacintoshCAD.andP;  Look to see these ideas take flight in the next version of yourfavorite CAD programs.andM;Phillip Robinson is a former technician and engineer who has been reviewingand consulting on CAD for the past ten years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
