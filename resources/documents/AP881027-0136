The assurances were made last week in Bonn in advance of thisweek's trip to Moscow by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a group of 30businessmen who have signed deals estimated at over $1 billion, saidan official.   The West Germans consulted with the United States about the dealsthey intended to sign, ``and we could see they were being verycareful,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not beidentified.   At the same time, the United States has warned West Germany andother allies in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral ExportControls, or COCOM, against being lulled into a false sense ofsecurity by recent Soviet reforms, the official said. COCOMdetermines which technologies members of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and Japan can sell to the Soviet bloc.   ``We have received assurances from (West Germany) that it willobserve established COCOM procedures when it comes to carrying outthe various commercial agreements reached by German firms inMoscow,'' said State Department spokesman Charles Redman.   The West German assurances were given last week to AmbassadorAllan Wendt, the State Department's specialist on export controls,who held talks in Bonn, Paris, Rome and London as part of regularlyscheduled consultations on COCOM.   The Paris-based organization has been seeking to streamline itscomplex list of banned technologies in response to the economicliberalization of several Soviet bloc countries.   The next full round of consultations on the changes is notexpected until next spring, when the new U.S. administration is inplace.   ``We and our allies sometimes can and do differ on specifics orexactly what needs to be done ... to ensure that we have strongbarriers around critical technologies,'' Redman said.   ``As allies, we settle these differences on an ongoing basiswithin COCOM,'' he added.   But the other official said ``some people'' within COCOM havebeen urging a wholesale lifting of controls on exports to the Sovietbloc. He declined to name names but indicated that West Germanofficials were among those to whom he referred.   ``There are domestic political pressures in some countries torelax COCOM restrictions,'' this official said. ``If you are livingacross the border from East Germany, for example, the temptation tobelieve the Soviet threat is over is great.''   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has beenadvocating greater trade with Moscow as a way of stimulating thestagnant economy and creating jobs.   But Wendt made it clear to the allies that ``the Soviet threathas to change before COCOM can relax its rules,'' the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
