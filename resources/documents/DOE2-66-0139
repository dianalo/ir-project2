Evaluating probable success of a well involves morethan simply drawing a contour map of initial potentials or cumulativeproduction. Such data are subject to error and considerable variationover small distances. Estimates commonly deviate markedly from volumesobserved after a well is drilled. A proper assessment of risk in drillinga well considers the range of likely outcomes. Nonparametric krigingestimates local frequency distributions from observed volumes, thus predictingthe probability of a well coming in at a given volume, and the volumeexpected for a specific percentile such as the median. Simulation wascarried out on Devonian shale production figures to generate possibleoutcomes at a number of sites. Most sites had about the same histogramof possible volumes, but the most favorable areas included rare, high-volumewells. The probability of offsetting a very good well with a second oneof similar volume is much lower than suggested by conventional contourmaps of gas volumes.</TEXT></DOC>
