It was early Saturday, June 3, and thousands of young,unarmed soldiers moved into the city.   An impenetrable wall of citizens stopped them as they marchedfrom the east and north toward Tiananmen Square, where students wereholding a huge sit-in for freedom and clean government.   ``Please go back. We don't need you here,'' a high school teachersaid.   The soldiers, some beginning to cry, broke ranks and retreated insmall, ragtag groups. Citizens escorted them out of Beijing, feelingthey had scored an important victory over rulers who had declaredmartial law but had been hesitant to apply it.   On the other side of the capital, thousands more residentssavored another apparent victory. Two buses of soldiers and weaponswere captured in the first military foray toward Tiananmen.   Students entered the supply bus and triumphantly waved assaultrifles out the windows. Others made impassioned speeches against thegovernment to a wildly approving crowd.   ``We are peaceful students who love our country,'' said a youngman with a white headband. ``Why must the people's army threaten thepeople with guns?''   Jubilation reigned, however briefly.   Within hours, hundreds would lie dead on the streets of Beijing,people of China killed by the People's Liberation Army. A movementfor a freer nation would be in shambles.</TEXT><NOTE>Saturday, June 3</NOTE><TEXT>   2:00 p.m. _ An army broadcast warns students to return theweapons from the supply bus captured at the Liubu intersection,about a mile west of the 100-acre Tiananmen Square. They ignore thewarning.   2:10 p.m. _ Riot police burst out from Zhongnanhai, headquartersof the Communist Party. Tear gas is used in Beijing for the firsttime in Communist China's 40-year history.   Security forces beat dozens of people mercilessly at the Liubuintersection. A woman falls down and policemen kick her. They grabher hair and beat her face with truncheons.   The weapons are recovered.   Demonstrators, their faces and chests bloodied, walk away inshock. A man with wounds to his head and back staggers down analleyway. ``My God! my God!'' he spits through shattered teeth.   After seven weeks of peaceful protest, the government had lostits patience.   A mile away, also at 2:10 p.m., about 5,000 unarmed soldiersmarched out of the Great Hall of the People but were blocked fromTiananmen by throngs of students and a city bus. It was the closestsoldiers had been to the square since martial law was declared May20.   ``If you want to shoot, shoot me!'' screamed a 73-year-old womanin pajamas. ``Just don't shoot the students.''   The mood moved like the sea of people. At one stage, the soldierssang military songs and the students applauded.   But the hot day wore on and tempers flared. A few soldiers lashedout with their belts. Rocks, tree branches and beer bottles flewbetween the two sides, and several people were bloodied.   Fighting abated and the standoff continued until 8 p.m., when thesoldiers returned to the Great Hall. Students shook their hands andpatted them on the back.   Half an hour later, thousands of people gathered on the bridge atMuxudi, the western gateway to the inner city. Crowds moved buses toblock passage to the bridge by massing troops.   The first wave of troops from the 27th Army charged toward thebridge at 10 p.m., firing tear gas and swinging clubs.   Burning rugs from a nearby apartment were thrown onto the busbarricades. A gas tank exploded, then another. The sky flickeredorange and black. Bullets whistled and richocheted. Tear gascanisters boomed.   ``Fascists! Fascists!'' the crowd chanted.   It was 11 o'clock. The soldiers opened fire, aiming low.   ``Live fire! Live fire!'' a student shouted, moments after abullet hit his leg.   Blood pooled on the pavement, spattered the bridge at Muxudi.   Gasoline bombs flew from the crowd at a tank. People surgedaround the tank, pulled two crewmen out and beat them senseless.   The civilians set the tank ablaze, with red flags reading``Democracy'' and ``Freedom'' flapping from its turrets.   Midnight comes, and with it the first breakthrough. Armoredpersonnel carriers smash through the blockade and head east towardthe square.   ``Clear the street! Clear the way!'' a medic yells.   Bloodied residents, sprawled on three-wheeled pedicabs andhowling with pain, are pushed up side streets. Ill-equipped doctorspound on chests and apply makeshift bandages. Their lips are redwith blood from mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.   ``He's gone; we've lost him!'' a medic yells as a man with abullet hole in his chest gurgles and shakes.   ``This is China! This is my country!'' a man screams, pointingdown the street where soldiers crouch and fire from the shadows.   A line of 50 troop trucks plows through the crumpled roadblock.Soldiers fire into the air. A cleaning woman on the 14th floor iskilled by gunfire and another woman is hit as she looks out from aneighth floor balcony.   An armored personnel carrier careens along the north side ofTiananmen Square and is greeted by gasoline bombs.   A second armored vehicle turns up the west side of the Great Hallof the People and the crowd stops it by hurling chunks of concrete.People pound the armor with sticks and pelt it with rocks.</TEXT><NOTE>Sunday, June 4</NOTE><TEXT>   12:30 a.m. _ More soldiers approach early Sunday from the south,firing as they come.
