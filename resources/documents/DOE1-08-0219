The effect of oxygen adsorption on isochromates of the(110) face of tungsten monocrystal is investigated. The obtained isochromaticspectra are compared with energy band structure of tungsten. Based onthe analysis of the obtained experimental results it is assumed thatoptical transition to the final state at the energy of 7.3 eV relativelyto Fermi level is conditioned by surface states of the tungsten face(110).</TEXT></DOC>
