The current relative economics of twowind energy system applications are discussed: a wind/diesel hybrid systemfor remote communities, and a wind farm for larger scale remote applications.The methodology used in this analysis is life cycle costing. Costs arecompared to systems using conventional diesel generation. Supply pricesare calculated for various average annual wind speeds. The primary conclusionis that there is some near-term market potential for wind energy systemsin remote areas, but penetration into the domestic grid supply marketis constrained by the relatively high costs of wind energy systems atthe present time. There does appear to be considerable export marketpotential for wind machines, but certain preconditions must be met forsuccessful market penetration. The most important condition is domesticmarket success, which could be achieved through successful demonstrationprojects. 2 refs., 2 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
