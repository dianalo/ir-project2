The company said net rose to $105.4 million, or $1.69 a share, from $70.7 million, or $1.01 a share, a year earlier. As a result of Gulf andamp; Western's continuing stock buyback program, the per-share figures reflect a decrease in average shares outstanding to 62.3 million from 70.3 million.    Revenue in the fourth quarter rose nearly 20% to $1.01 billion from $843.1 million. The figures include revenue from the company's unconsolidated finance subsidiary. The quarter's results reflected a one-time gain of $38.7 million from the sale of real estate, while year-earlier results included a profit from discontinued operations of $14.6 million from the consumer and industrial products group, which was sold in September 1985. Gandamp;W's earnings from continuing operations in the quarter rose 19% to $66.7 million, or $1.07 a share, from $56.1 million, or 80 cents share.    Following the sale of the consumer and industrial products operations, financial services now account for 52% of Gandamp;W's earnings, while publishing and entertainment account for 25% and 23% of earnings, respectively.    Gandamp;W said its directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 22.5 cents, payable April 1 to stock of record March 13.    Analysts had expected the strong gains at Gulf andamp; Western. Phua K. Young, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., noted that the fourth quarter was buoyed by strong results at Paramount Pictures Corp., which had the largest gain of the three units thanks to a strong movie release schedule. Mr. Young praised the dividend increase as &quot;a nice gesture for shareholders&quot; and &quot;another way for management to increase value for the shareholders.&quot;    Martin S. Davis, Gulf andamp; Western's chairman and chief executive officer, said the dividend increase &quot;is consistent with our desire to pay out dividends equal to approximately 25% of our earnings.&quot;    In fiscal 1986, Gandamp;W's earnings increased 7.9% to $267.4 million, or $4.28 a share, from $247.8 million, or $3.51 a share.    Fiscal 1986 results include the $38.7 million gain, while fiscal 1985 results include a $96.2 million profit from discontinued operations from the consumer and industrial products group. Profit from continuing operations for the year rose 51% to $228.7 million, or $3.66 a share, from $151.6 million, or $2.15 a share.    Revenue in the fiscal year rose 14% to $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in fiscal 1985.    Gulf andamp; Western said its Associates Corp. of North America financial services unit reported gains in each of its business areas, with the consumer finance segment contributing the largest share of operating profit. In its publishing and information services unit, publisher Simon andamp; Schuster reported strong gains in educational publishing. However, the trade publishing group, which sells hardcover and mass-market paperback books, had a downturn in the fourth quarter despite such fiscal 1986 best sellers as &quot;Hollywood Husbands&quot; in hardcover and &quot;Lucky&quot; in paperback.    At Paramount, meanwhile, strong gains came from such movies as &quot;Top Gun,&quot; &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
