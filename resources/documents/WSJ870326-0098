Helen Bottel? She's a 72-year-old grandmother who lives here with her husband, a retired state-government worker. And in Japan she is probably better known than either Mr. Heston or Mr. Boone.    For the past four years she has dispensed a weekly dose of snappy all-American advice to the lonely, the lovelorn and a lot of disenchanted housewives. Her forum is the Sunday edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest circulation newspaper in Japan -- and the world. Readers know her as &quot;Heren Oba-san,&quot; or &quot;ancient and venerable Aunt Helen.&quot; She is the Dear Abby of Japan.    She's hardly an obvious Abby-san, at least at first glance. She doesn't speak or read Japanese, and until September had never even visited the place. Her knowledge of the nation is gleaned mainly from the public library. &quot;I can't even use chopsticks,&quot; she admits.    That's never stopped her, however, from dashing off plain-speaking advice that is often the most controversial commentary in the paper. A Mrs. K. from Saitama recently complained that her husband took business trips abroad and went drinking most evenings while she was stuck in the house with a cranky mother-in-law and two small children. &quot;I am about to lose the smile on my face for everyday I feel the unfairness,&quot; she desponded. &quot;Don't just sit there and lose the smile,&quot; chided Aunt Helen. Her advice: Hold a family conference and demand change in the house. If that fails, join -- or start -- a women's-rights organization.    To a Mr. T. who wrote that wives should be content to work in the house, Aunt Helen replied, &quot;A woman has as much right as a man to seek a life outside the home.&quot; And to the woman wondering what an elderly lady in Japan should do, Aunt Helen counseled, &quot;Go out and get married.&quot;    Sit down and write a letter is what many do after reading Aunt Helen. Several columns have sparked as many as 1,000 reader replies, some delighted, many appalled. &quot;But even when they disagree, the Japanese are very polite,&quot; Mrs. Bottel observes in flat California tones. &quot;In America, people can be very mean when they disagree.&quot;    Helen Bottel is familiar with American-style back talk because for 25 years she wrote a nationally syndicated advice column for King Features Syndicate. Called &quot;Helen Help Us&quot; -- she loathed the name -- it appeared in more than 200 papers at its peak, including the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Sacramento Bee, the Newark Star Ledger and dozens that have since closed down.    She also co-authored a similar column called &quot;Generation Rap&quot; -- she wasn't wild about that name, either -- which paired her advice with that of her teen-age daughter. &quot;She ended up being the conservative one,&quot; Mrs. Bottel chuckles.    Three years ago (and three years too early to enter the Chicago Sun-Times's Ann Landers replacement contest), she tired of being &quot;the third person in a field of two,&quot; as she refers to the advice world's twin oracles, Dear Abby and Ann Landers. She retired &quot;Helen Help Us,&quot; but only after she had become Aunt Heren.    That happened in 1982. As a subscriber to King Features, the Japanese paper had received Mrs. Bottel's column for years. &quot;They just never used it,&quot; she says. Then a new editor, educated in the U.S., took over the Yomiuri's women's page. She liked Mrs. Bottel's sassy style and savvy counsel, and ran the column. It was an instant hit. (The Japanese felt it offered valuable insights into American culture.)    The editor next asked her to write a weekly column especially for the Japanese. &quot;She told me, 'Don't pull your punches. Write exactly as you would for American readers,'&quot; Mrs. Bottel recalls, and she has. Her appeal, she believes, is that she is totally different from the Japanese advice columnists, who tend to take a traditional approach to problems. (Women are routinely told to stay at home, persevere and quit complaining.) Occasionally, Mrs. Bottel's advice is teamed with that of a Japanese counselor, for that bicultural touch. But usually the column consists of a reader's letter, Aunt Helen's answer and a cute little photograph of the smiling and deceptively youthful-looking California grandmother.    The only thing in her new life that makes Mrs. Bottel frown is that she no longer gets to choose the letters she answers. Each month the Yomiuri sends her a batch, carefully translated and typed in English. In a cheery room of her suburban ranch-style house, Mrs. Bottel writes her replies, then sends them to Tokyo, where they are translated into Japanese.    She also misses being able to read her columns once they're published.    Yet she has few qualms about dispatching advice to a nation with such a different culture, although she agrees that attitudes in the U.S. and Japan tend to diverge. A Japanese wife who complains about her husband will end her letter asking &quot;Am I a bad person?&quot; while an American wife usually concludes, &quot;How do I get rid of the bum?&quot;    But problems are the same all over the world, she says. &quot;You have problems with your husband, your wife, your children. Teen-agers have problems at school.&quot; She admits she was stumped her first week on the job when she got a letter about arranged marriages, which she didn't know about at all. And she raised a ruckus when she suggested that a childless Japanese couple adopt a Korean baby, a heretical notion in a nation that prides itself on racial &quot;purity.&quot; But she likes stirring things up. &quot;And I always leap before I look,&quot; she adds.    That approach got her in the advice business in the first place. Back in 1958, Mrs. Bottel, a mother of four, was editor of a weekly paper, circulation 300, for a small town on the California-Oregon border. One day she found her husband reading &quot;Dear Abby,&quot; doubled over with laughter. &quot;It made me mad,&quot; she says. &quot;He had never laughed at my humorous stuff, and I told him I could do better. He said to prove it.&quot;    She made up a sample Q and A column, sent it to the Daily Courier in Grants Pass, Ore., and got $5 in return, along with a request for more. That was pretty simple, so a few weeks later, she sent her newly minted clips to King Features. Within days she was hired. &quot;As it happened they were looking for an advice columnist, but at the time I had no idea how difficult it was to get hired by a syndicate.&quot;    She quickly mastered the advice-business basics -- never advise outright on problems with many sides, and when all else fails, suggest counseling.    A Southern California childhood she describes as &quot;poor and deprived&quot; may have given her a special empathy with the troubled, as well. When she was two, her father left home. When she was 15, her mother died, after suffering from a severe mental condition, &quot;not a beautiful thing to behold,&quot; says Mrs. Bottel.    After that, she was placed with a &quot;wonderful&quot; foster mother and, working as a maid, eventually put herself through Riverside Community College. There she met Bob Bottel, who has been her husband for the past 50 years. He was editor of the school paper, and she did exactly what venerable Aunt Helen might advise a young Japanese woman to do in a similar situation. She joined the paper. &quot;I got my man and my work all at once,&quot; she concludes.    ---   Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer based in London. </TEXT></DOC>
