Stevens andamp; Co. remains the hub of a frenziedbidding contest, with rival suitors Odyssey Partners and WestPoint-Pepperell Inc. each sweetening their buyout offers a thirdtime for the textile giant.   Odyssey ended the latest round in the lengthy auction lateMonday by raising to $1.22 billion, or $68.50 a share, the price itis willing to pay under its March 29 agreement to acquire Stevens.   The sweetened offer by the investment firm came hours afterPepperell had raised its cash tender offer for New York-basedStevens to $1.19 billion, or $67 a share for each of Stevens' 17.8million common shares outstanding.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens stock rose 50cents a share to close at $66.50, indicating speculators wereunsure that the heated bidding would move much higher.   Odyssey's latest bid, which topped its previous $64-a-shareoffer, worth about $1.14 billion, will expire at midnight EDT April22 unless extended.   In addition to sweetening its rival bid, Pepperell said itremoved major antitrust concerns about its proposal by agreeingwith the Federal Trade Commission to sell certain Stevens assets ifits offer succeeds.   Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle forStevens, a leading maker of home textiles such as sheets andtowels. But they said the bidding was reaching the upper limits ofa reasonable price for the 175-year-old company.   ``Based on my expectations for Stevens' cash flow this year, andassuming some overhead...and capital spending could be cut some, itsupports a bid of $65 a share and not significantly above that,''said Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Co.   Joseph L. Lanier Jr., Pepperell's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said in an interview that he considered $1.19 billion afair price. But he said the company would have to ``consider ouroptions'' if Odyssey increased its bid.   Pepperell had no comment late Monday on whether it wouldinitiate yet another round of bidding. The company's offer, whichis not conditioned on financing, expires at midnight EDT April 22.   Odyssey had charged that a Pepperell-Stevens merger wouldviolate antitrust laws. But Pepperell said it reached agreementwith the FTC on Friday over divestitures to ease those concerns.   The FTC would permit Pepperell's previously announced plans tosell half of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet linesfor about $170 million to NTC Group, parent of the textilemanufacturer Bibb Co., Pepperell said.   The FTC also waived waiting requirements under federaldisclosure laws but might require Pepperell to sell a sheetingmill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name ifthe deal was consummated, Pepperell stated.   The FTC has six months to decide whether Pepperell must divestthose Stevens assets.   Prudential-Bache's Bronston said the sheeting mill generatesannual sales of between $30 million to $40 million, while the yarnplant is relatively small.   Among the designer licenses the FTC has identified as potentialproblems are Ralph Lauren, Gloria Vanderbilt, Eileen West and PerryEllis, Bronston said.   Pepperell's Lanier said that while he would prefer not to sellthose assets, ``it would have no significant impact if we had to.''   Bronston said that given its situation, Pepperell might beforced to sell the licenses at prices lower than what the companypaid for them.   Stevens also has licenses for the designers Laura Ashley, PierreCardin and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands includeArrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyoutoffer earlier this year from a group led by its own seniormanagement, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth-generationmember of the family that founded the company in 1813.   Pepperell, which is based in West Point, Ga., launched a$62.50-a-share tender offer last month after Stevens agreed to abuyout by Odyssey at $61.50 a share.   Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $64, and announcedlast week that it had commitments in place to finance the $1.14billion bid.   Under terms of its agreement with Odyssey, Stevens board said itwould pay the firm up to $8 million if the textile company wasacquired by a third party for more than $64 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
