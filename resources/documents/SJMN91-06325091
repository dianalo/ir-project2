Buses rolled through theneighborhood and the people eagerly waited to pile aboard for the trip to themuseum -- even members of a youth gang. &quot;Sorry, but you can't ride the bus ifyou're wearing gang colors,&quot; officials from Project Crackdown, the city'santi-drug program, told the youths. Officials feared that the attire mightprovoke other gang members. Undeterred, the youths drove to the museum intheir own cars, where once again they were told that their gang dress madeentry impossible. So they shucked the gang jackets and headgear, went into themuseum and -- like all the others inside -- mixed and mingled and played andlaughed and had a great time. Proving, of course, that kids are still kids --if they can find a way to be just kids.;   GAMES PEOPLE PLAY -- Racquetball isthe game regularly played by Will Kempton, head of the Santa Clara CountyTraffic Authority, and Jim Harper of HMH Inc., an engineering firm that oftendoes work for the authority. &quot;We usually split,&quot; Kempton reports, &quot;but lastweek I beat Harper 15-0. You don't suppose he threw the game because HMH isdesperate for more work.&quot; (Kempton admits he just wants to kid Harper aboutthe loss. And now that it's in black and white, Harper should be motivatedenough to try a little skunking of his own.) . . . The numbers are even moreimpressive for Murphy Sabatino's petition drive to limit the terms of SantaClara County supervisors. It needed 41,000-plus signatures by Jan. 5 to putthe issue on the ballot, and Sabatino says more than 45,000 already have beencollected. By January, he hopes to have 75,000 to 80,000. . . . High-techhoncho Jerry Beemiller hopes to have a lovely damsel in distress to rescueThursday night when he plays the hero in a melodrama at Campbell's GaslighterTheater, benefiting the Crippled Children's Society of Santa Clara County.Wait'll he finds out that &quot;Li'l Nell&quot; is John Travis -- a not-so-li'l formerSan Diego Charger.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MUSEUM TRIP DRAWS KIDS LIKE GANGBUSTERS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     GOOD MOVES -- The economy has made fund-raising tough, but not in everycase. More than 1,000 attended a Mass by Croatian Cardinal Franjo Kuharic inSan Jose on Sunday -- and contributed $25,000 to Croatian war relief. . . .Remember the $30,000 contributed earlier this year by Kulicke andamp; Soffa, aSilicon Valley manufacturer, to the Visiting Nurse Association? The companyhad won a Corvette at a trade show, took the cash instead and gave it to theVNA. The nurses, in turn, used it to launch Children's Care-ousel, a hospiceprogram for dying children, and it's now up and running. &quot;We have three babieswith AIDS on service now,&quot; reports Adele Ratcliff of the VNA.;   MORE GOODMOVES -- Want to help but don't have the cash? A large supply of surgicalgoods has been collected locally for shipment to Yugoslavian hospitals by theaforementioned Croatian relief fund, but it could use someone with airtransport connections to get the stuff there. (Info: the Rev. Bono Prcela,408-279-0279.) Pat Mormon of Pasquale's restaurant could use some donatedturkeys to prepare for the needy at the Loaves and Fishes soup kitchen. (He'sat 476 S. First St. in San Jose.) And the U.S. Postal Service needs volunteersto answer children's letters to Santa. (Contact: Paul Woods, 408-723-6143.) Ifyou can't be Santa, feeling like one is the next best thing.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911120  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  614  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 20, 199100325091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
