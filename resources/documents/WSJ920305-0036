Known until now for its big mainframe computers andmidrange systems, the U.K. company suddenly is also staking aclaim in the $27.3 billion PC market in Western Europe,currently led by International Business Machines Corp.,Compaq Computer Corp. and Olivetti andamp; Co.</LP><TEXT>   By the mid-1990s, ICL aims to eclipse its PC competitorsin this market. In particular, it hopes to knock IBM from itsaccustomed place at the top of the heap.   Of course, such predictions are easier to make than toaccomplish, particularly from ICL's current position as a PClaggard in most of Europe. But with a profitable operationand the strong support of its 80% owner, Japanese behemothFujitsu Ltd. -- IBM's arch-rival and the second-biggestcomputer company in the world -- ICL is certainly a crediblecontender.   &quot;You have to respect any goal they set for themselves,because they're one of the few companies in the world thatusually do exactly what they say they will do,&quot; says MarekVaygelt, research director for U.K. market-research firmRomtec.   ICL first signaled a serious intent in PCs with the $399million acquisition of Oy Nokia's computer division, NokiaData, in October. PCs now form the core of ICL's biggestdivision, Personal Systems, which accounts for more than 25%of the company's $4 billion annual revenue. (The divisionalso includes computer terminals, which attach to largersystems, and some PC-related software.)   Now, a scant five months after the Nokia Data purchase,ICL is going public with fresh PC products and big Europeanambitions -- a move timed to coincide with a new, higherprofile for the company at the huge CeBIT computer fair inHanover, Germany, next week.   ICL's new machines appear workmanlike and illustrate thecompany's progress from its low-powered entry into the marketonly four years ago. But they aren't particularly special.Developed in both Finland and the U.K., they include thelatest microprocessor brains and up-to-date features such aseasy upgradability and &quot;ergonomic&quot; design. But PCs today varylittle from one maker to the next, and differentiationusually occurs in other areas, such as price, availablity orservice.   While it wants to be price-competitive, ICL says itdoesn't intend to buy market share as a lowball supplier.Instead, it intends to sell its machines ascomfortable-to-use, reliable corporate PCs that exceedEurope's increasingly stringent safety rules.   ICL's marketing plans include its first-ever televisionadvertisements in its home U.K. market and a seven-countryEuropean tour to show the PCs to 10,000 potential customers,mostly buyers from large corporations.   ICL needs to make a big push because its current positionin the market for PCs used by businesses is rather lowly. In1991, the companies that now constitute ICL's PC business,ICL and Nokia Data, ranked a combined eighth in the Europeanmarket for IBM-compatible PCs with a scant 1.7% share, saysmarket-research firm Dataquest. IBM had 14% of the units soldin Europe, while Compaq and Olivetti jostled for second placewith 5.4% and 5.2%, respectively.   But ICL's PC shipments grew a healthy 25% in 1991, notesDavid Mills, head of personal systems for ICL, while revenuerose 11% in a year that saw overall industry revenue sag on aslight sales increase in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
