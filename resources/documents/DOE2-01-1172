Central axispercentage depth doses and off-axis ratios measured with such a collimatorshow variations with the source-to-surface distance (SSD). Errors maybe introduced into isodose distributions calculated with the effectiveSSD method when beam data measured at a fixed SSD are used. A treatmentplanning algorithm using beam data measured at two SSDs to allow an interpolationand extrapolation procedure to account for SSD variations has been implemented.For calculations in off-axis planes, off-axis ratios normal to the planeof rotation are also required. Results of the calculations were checkedwith film dosimetry measurements and found to be in good agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
