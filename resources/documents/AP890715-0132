Ramona Santorelli, one of the women who participated in theprotest, said the group, called the Coalition for Topfree Equality,wanted to make the statement that rules against shirtless women werediscriminatory.   ``I think that people are making the connection, the deeperissues. We're not just exposing our breasts. We're exposing thesexual issues, the inequality,'' Santorelli said.
