To assist potentialapplicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly askedquestions. In general these questions and answers are applicable to alldirect grant competitions covered by this combined application package.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances.Any change must be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and apply to <T3>all</T3> applications. Waivers for individual applications <T3>cannot</T3> be granted, regardless of the circumstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must theybe bound?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Current Government-wide policy is that only an original and twocopies need be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. At leastone copy should be left unbound of facilitate any necessary reproduction.Applicants should not use foldouts, photographs, or other materials thatare hard-to-duplicate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submitunder another competition?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Yes, but it may not be worth the postage. A properly prepared applicationshould meet the specifications of the competition to which it is submitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate. What shouldI do?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. We are happy to discuss the questions with you and provide clarificationon the unique elements of the various competitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Will you help us prepare our application?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. We are happy to provide general program information. Claarly, itwould not be appropriate for staff to participate in the actual writingof an application, but we can respond to specific questions about applicationrequirements, evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants shouldunderstand that this previous contact is not required, nor does it guaranteethe success of an application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months ofthe application closing date, depending on the number of applications receivedand the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, canyou tell me the outcome?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. No. Every year we can called by a number of applicants who havelegitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome of the review priorto official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, someneed to notify a local school district, etc. Regardless of the reason,because final funding decisions have not been made at that point, we cannotshare information about the review with <T3>anyone.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. How long should an application be?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reducethe volume of paperwork in discretionary program applications. The scopeand complexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits onlength. Your application should provide enough information to allow thereview panel to evaluate the significance of the project against the criteriaof the competition. It is helpful to include in the appendices such informationas:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should includethe person's title and role in the proposed project and contain only informationrelevant to the proposed project. Qualifications of counsultants and advisorycouncil members should be provided and be similarly brief.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Assurance of participation of an agency other than the applicantif such participation is critical to the project, including copies of evaluationinstruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where suchinstruments are not in general use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. How can I be sure that my application is assigned to the correctcompetition?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Applicants should clearly indicate in Block 10 of the face pageof their application (Standard form 424) the CFDA number and the titleof the program priority (e.g., 023) representing the competition in whichthe application should be considered. If this information is not provided,your application may inadvertently be assigned and reviewed under a differentcompetition from the one you intended. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Will my application be retured if am not funded?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. We no longer return original copies of unsuccessful applications.Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application. Copiesof reviewer comments will be mailed to applicants who are not successful.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. How should my application be organized?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. The application narrative should be organized to follow the exactsequence of the components in the selection criteria of the regulationspertaining to the specific program competition for which the applicationis prepared. In each instance, a table of contents and a one-page abstractsummarizing the objectives, activities, project participants, and expectedoutcomes of the proposed project should precede the application narrative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed (i.e.travel for data collection, etc.). Because we may request the principalinvestigator or director of funded projects to attend an annual meeting,you may also wish to include a trip to Washington, DC in the travel budget.Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. If my application receives a high score from the reviewer doesthat mean that I will receive funding?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. No. It is often the case that the number of applications scoredhighly by or approved by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available forfunding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection,which is based on the scores of the applications and other relevant factors,determines the applications that can be funded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. What happens during negotiations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised.These are issues that have been identified during panel and staff reviewand require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.''These are issues that have been identified as so critical that the awardcannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raisedabout the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because thereis inadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item,or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completionof the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriouslyaffect the project's success, you may provide reasons for not making thechanges or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budgetreductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities,you may explain why and provide additional justification for the proposedexpenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have beenresolved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. If my application is successful can I assume I will get the estimated/projectedbudget amounts in subsequent years?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. No. The estimate for subsequent year project costs is helpful tous for planning purposes but it in no way represents a commitment for aparticular level of funding in subsequent years. Grantees having a multi-yearproject will be asked to submit a continuation application and a detailedbudget request prior to each year of the project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. What is a cooperative agreement and how does it differ from a grant?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. A cooperative agreement is similar to a grant in that its principalpurpose is to provide assistance for a public purpose of support or stimulationas authorized by a Federal statute. A cooperative agreement differs froma grant because of the substantial involvement anticipated between theexecutive agency (in this case the Department of Education) and the recipientduring the performance of the contemplated activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Is the procedure for applying for a cooperative agreement differentfrom the procedure for applying for a grant?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. No. If the Department of Education determines that a given awardshould be made by cooperative agreement rather than a grant, the applicantwill be advised at the time of negotiation of any special procedures thatmust be followed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. How do I provide an assurance?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Simply state in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Q. Where can copies of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>program regulations, and federal statutes beobtained?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library.If not, they can be obtained from the Government Printing Office by writingto: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,DC 20402.
