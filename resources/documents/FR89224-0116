Dettmar, (202) 275-7245(TDD for hearing impaired: 202-275-1721)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In 1983 Congress amended section 8of the National Trails System Act (Trails Act), 16 U.S.C. 1247 (d), toimplement a declared national policy of preserving railroad rights-of-wayfor future reactivation of rail service. As amended, section 1247(d) providesthat rights-of-way that might otherwise be abandoned may be preserved andused on an interim basis as trails. Under the terms of the amendment ``suchinterim use shall not be treated, for purposes of any law or rule of law,as an abandonment of the use of such rights-of-way for railroad purposes.''Congress also provided that the trail user is to assume responsibilityfor liability in connection with the trial use, including managing andpaying taxes on the corridor. Thus, section 1247(d) allows for the routeto remain intact and available for future railroad use (rail banking),while relieving the railroad of liability and financial responsibilityfor the right-of-way during the period of interim trail use.A railroad's decision to enter into a Trails Act agreement is similar toa carrier's decision to seek discontinuance rather than full abandonmentauthority for a particular line. Discontinuance authority, like rail banking,allows a railroad to cease operating a line for an indefinite time whilepreserving the rail corridor for the possible reactivation of rail servicein the future. By contrast, once a carrier exercises the authority grantedin a regular abandonment certificate the line is no longer part of thenational transportation system. Because the carrier's full interest insuch lines generally is sold upon abandonment, the rail corridor wouldhave to be reassembled prior to the resumption of any rail service.In April 1986, we issued final regulations implementing section 1247(d).(Supplemental regulations were issued in 1987.) Our rules set forth proceduresfor prospective trail users and railroads voluntarily to enter into interimtrail use agreements. In addition, we rejected the claim that section 1247(d)should be construed as not preempting State laws that might otherwise causea reversion of right-of-way upon the discontinuation of rail operations.We took the position that adjacent landowners have no proprietary intereststhat require protection or compensation under the Fifth Amendment becauseall that the rules (and statute) provide for is temporary postponementof the vesting of reversionary interests (from the time when rail operationscease until the time a full abandonment certificate is issued).In <T3>National Wildlife Federation </T3>v. <T3>I.C.C.,</T3> 850 F.2d 694 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<T3>NWF</T3>), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit affirmed our view that section 1247(d) permits only voluntary transfers.\1\<NOTE/> The court also rejected the argument that rail banking isnecessarily a fiction (<T3>i.e.,</T3> that no railroad that has made the decision to abandon realisticallyintends to reactivate rail service). Moreover, it upheld (850 F.2d at 705)Congress' authority to decide in the Trails Act to preempt State law anddefeat the vesting of reversionary interests when property is convertedfrom rail use to trail use. However, the court remanded for further considerationour conclusion that the application of our rules could never constitutea compensable taking of the property of the holders of reversionary interestsin the rights-of-way.\2\<NOTE/> <T3>See id.</T3> We reconsider that taking question here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Accord, Washington </T3>v. <T3>ICC, </T3>829 F.2d 877 (9th Cir. 1987); <T3>Connecticut Trust</T3> v. <T3>ICC,</T3> 841 F.2d 479 (2d Cir. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ While the court remanded this rulemaking proceeding forfurther consideration, the court's decision did not strike down any ofour rules and, hence, does not affect our administration of the statute.Nor does it void authority granted under the rules or require specificamendments to our Trails Act procedures.Many railroad rights-of-way are on land that the railroads do not own butrather hold under easements or other fee simple determinable interests(herein collectively ``easements'' or ``reversionary interests''). Theseeasements may or may not be limited specifically to railroad use and mayor may not revert if rail use is abandoned. Frequently, however, theseeasements provide that, upon abandonment of rail operations, the propertyreverts to the abutting landowner. State law generally governs the dispositionof reversionary interests, subject to our plenary jurisdiction to regulateabandonments and impose conditions affecting post-abandonment of use ofthe property. <T3>See Chicago and N.W. Transp. Co. </T3>v. <T3>Kalo Brick andamp; Tile Co.,</T3> 450 U.S. 311, 330 (1981); <T3>Hayfield Northern R. Co. </T3>v. <T3>Chicago andamp; N.W. Transp. Co., </T3>467 U.S. 622, 633 (1984).Usually, once an unconditional abandonment certificate has been issued,becomes effective, and has been consummated, a railroad's operating easementwill be extinguished. The Trails Act was intended to allow transportationcorridors subject to such easements to be used on an interim basis as recreationaltrails, while being preserved for possible future railroad use.Under the Trails Act rules, when the trail operator agrees to be financiallyand managerially responsible for the right-of-way or enters into an agreementto purchase it, and the railroad voluntarily agrees to transfer its interestin the right-of-way to the trail operator, we issue either a Certificateof Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (CITU) or, in an exemption proceeding,a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (NITU). A CITU or NITU allowsthe railroad to discontinue service and permits the carrier and trail operatorto negotiate an agreement for interim trail use subject to the rail bankingand liability conditions in the statute permitting the trail operator toacquire the right-of-way. If a trail use agreement is reached, then abandonmentcannot be accomplished under the CITU or NITU until the trail use terminates(without restoration of rail service). If no trail use agreement is reachedwithin 180 days, the CITU or NITU converts into a certificate or noticeof abandonment.The question presented here is whether, by permitting the trail operatorto take possession under these circumstances, and, in turn, postponinga reversionary interest that would otherwise have vested,\3\<NOTE/> our Trails Act rules result in a taking of private propertyinterests for public use for which just compensation must be paid underthe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\4\<NOTE/> Petitioners in various proceedings both before us and incourt have tried to challenge the constitutionality of Section 1247(d)on its face. However, every court that has considered the matter has foundthat section 1247(d) is a valid exercise of the United States' CommerceClause power. <T3>See Glosemeyer, infra,</T3> explaining that in light of our plenaryauthority over abandonments, the means selected (postponement of abandonmentto encourage interim trail use) were reasonably adapted to the end permitted(rail banking). <T3>Accord, NWF, supra; Preseault </T3>v. <T3>ICC, </T3>853 F.2d 145 (2d Cir. 1988). Because it is clear that Congresshad the authority to enact section 1247(d), the only question before usis whether compensation is available for any taking found to have occurred.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In every Trails Act case, we will already have found thatthe public convenience and necessity permit abandonment (or that regulatoryapproval is not required under 49 U.S.C. 10505).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Fifth Amendment provides ``Nor shall private propertybe taken for public use, without just compensation.''Several courts have recently addressed the issue of whether section 1247(d)effects a Fifth Amendment taking without compensation. As indicated above,the D.C. Circuit, in <T3>NWF </T3>rejected this agency's argument that section 1247(d) couldnever effect a taking. The court indicated that the analysis in our TrailsAct rules had been too simplistic and explained that, even though the TrailsAct is a valid exercise of Congressional authority, the issue of whethercompensation is required is a separate question that depends on State law,the nature of the property interest, and the facts of the particular case.However, in <T3>Presault, supra,</T3> the Second Circuit adopted the argument thatwe had urged in the D.C. Circuit and flatly rejected the argument thatlandowners' property had been taken by indefinitely postponing (for theperiod of interim trail use) the reversion of an interest that would otherwisehave vested under state law. Moreover, in <T3>Glosemeyer, infra,</T3> the district court, in upholding the constitutionalityof the statute but rejecting a taking claim because it was not broughtin the Claims Court under the Tucker Act, noted that Congress <T3>either</T3> did not believe that postponement of a railroad's abandonmentfor the period of interim trail use constituted a taking (the <T3>Preseault</T3> approach) <T3>or </T3>assumed that the Tucker Act would provide an adequate remedyfor any taking that might be found to have taken place.In short, section 1247(d) does not effect an unconstitutional taking ofprivate property without just compensation. There can be no violation ofthe Fifth Amendment Takings Clause unless a money remedy is unavailable.Because the Tucker Act is available to redress any takings claims thatlandowners might have, property owners are entitled to seek relief in theClaims Court, where the allegation that a taking has occurred can be tested.Given the fact that the compensation issue is still being actively litigated(<T3>Glosemeyer</T3> is on appeal in the Eighth Circuit and a petition forcertiorari was filed in <T3>Preseault</T3>), we have decided not to take any position on the meritsof the different interpretations at this time. Nor will we attempt to establishparameters for when a compensable taking might occur. If <T3>Preseault </T3>is correctly decided, then the application of the TrailsAct can never effect a compensable taking. On the other hand, if the D.C.Circuit's position should prevail, the Claims Court would undertake a case-by-caseanalysis of State law, the nature of the property interest, and the factsof the particular case to determine whether compensation is required.In any event, this agency is not the proper forum to decide whether, inindividual cases, a compensable taking has occurred. Rather, the UnitedStates Claims Court has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1491,to consider claims and award compensation for any taking that might befound under this statute. <T3>See Glosemeyer </T3>v. <T3>Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., </T3> 685 F. Supp. 1108 (E.D. Mo. 1988).That forum is in the best position to determine whether a compensable takinghas occurred. The Claims Court, not the ICC, has the expertise to decidetaking questions. Whether compensation is required is fact-dependent anddoes not turn on any laws that we administer and thus we have no expertiseto bring to bear on the compensation issues.In this regard, we will briefly address plaintiff Beres' argument beforethe court in <T3>NWF</T3> that the rail banking purpose of the Trails Act is a fictionthat can and should be disregarded. The court expressly rejected the argumentthat rail banking necessarily is a fiction. We would go further, by statingour firm belief that the legitimacy of rail banking can be presumed inevery case.Congress clearly intended to preserve as many transportation corridorsas possible as an important national resource. <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 28, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 8-9 (1983), citedin <T3>NWF</T3> at n. 10. <T3>See also id. </T3>at 697-98 and the discussion in <T3>Glosemeyer</T3> of the history of this statute and the fact that Congressfor sometime prior to amending the Trails Act in 1983 had been concernedabout the loss of rail corridors as an important public resource. Congressdid not distinguish between short- and long-term rail banking, and, therefore,we do not believe that specific contingency plans for reactivation of aline are necessary to justify retention of a potentially valuable nationalasset. In any event, the fact that the railroad agrees to trail use isindication in and of itself that the corridor may be valuable in the futurefor transportation.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ If the railroad refuses to negotiate a Trails Act agreement,it obtains a full abandonment certificate and, following consummation,the line is no longer subject to our jurisdiction for any purpose. Accordingly,the railroad can dispose of its property (including the right-of-way) inany way it wants. This is not the case if a railroad agrees to interimtrail use. Moreover, because of the rail banking condition in the statute,we retain jurisdiction over the property and any disposal of the propertyis subject to the possibility that rail service may be resumed on the corridor.We do not believe that railroads would agree to rail banking if they didnot believe that a rail corridor could be valuable for rail purposes inthe future.Finally, having addressed the taking issue in light of <T3>NWF</T3> (and the other relevant court cases) we will, as the courtdirected, also consider whether any modification of our rules is necessary.\6\<NOTE/> We find that no changes to our Trails Act procedures arerequired, and that this statement of policy, reflecting the opportunityto seek relief in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act, is sufficientto address the concern of the <T3>NWF</T3> court as to the availability of redress for any takings claimsthe property owners may have. Because we have decided not to amend ourrules, but merely to clarify the appropriate avenue for seeking relieffor any taking claims, as required by the court in its order of remand,we are issuing this policy statement without seeking public comment, andour decision will be effective immediately.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ As indicated above (<T3>see </T3>n. 2, <T3>supra</T3>), the <T3>NWF</T3> decision did not void authority granted under the Trails Actrules or require specific amendments to our regulations. Any authoritygranted under our rules remains in full force and effect.This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the humanenvironment or energy conservation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Decided: February 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission, Chairman Gradison, Vice Chairman Simmons, CommissionersAndre, Lamboley, and Phillips.
