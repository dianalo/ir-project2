Syrian forces went on full alert.   Helicopters flew in about 500 Israeli troops to the northernedge of Ain Ata in the foothills of Mount Hermon before dawn,Lebanese police said.   The troops then fanned out around the area and began theirsearch.   Several hours later six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnelcarriers rolled into the village, police said.   ``It seems the Israelis are reinforcing their positions,'' saida police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standingregulations.   He said the Syrian command ordered its estimated 16,000 troopsin the Bekaa Valley north of the village on ``maximum alert''shortly after the Israeli operation started.   In Ain Ata, Israeli troops distributed leaflets calling onresidents not to cooperate with Palestinian guerrillas. The villageof about 3,500 people has been a stronghold for the guerrillas andtheir Lebanese allies.   Before the helicopter landing, Israeli artillery shelled areasaround Ain Ata and several nearby villages. There were no reportsof casualties.   The operation occurred north of Israel's self-designatedsecurity zone in south Lebanon. Israel created the zone in 1985after it withdrew most of its forces, which had occupied Lebanonsince 1982.   The police spokesman said Israeli troops had not clashed withthe Syrians.   ``But the Syrians have their tanks dug in on hills overlookingthe Israeli operational zone,'' the spokesman said.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir indicated his governmentwas not seeking a confrontation with Syria. ``I don't think thereis such a danger ...,'' he told Israel radio today.   He described the operation as part of Israel's ongoing policy ofconducting sweeps in south Lebanon and added: ``It is a usualaction of watching and securing the area from attacks ofterrorists.''   The operation began Monday night. The Israeli army censor heldup initial reports for hours.   Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss instructed itsambassador at the United Nations, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodge acomplaint against the Israeli action.   ``This new aggression by the (Israeli) occupation forcesviolates the U.N. Charter,'' Hoss said.   An Israeli commander in Lebanon, not identified by name, toldIsrael radio he instructed his soldiers that the operation was acomplicated one.   ``Don't be speedy in pressing the trigger ... but if you doshoot you mean it seriously and shoot in order to kill.''   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, told Israelradio the operation sought to ``deliver a message to residents ofthe villages outside the security zone that we would not agree toan increase of hostile activity against the state of Israel.''   The operation was Israel's largest in Lebanon since Feb. 17,1986, when more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks pushed intosouth Lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by Lebaneseguerrillas.   During that operation, Israeli troops detained more than 100suspected guerrillas and questioned 3,000 Lebanese civilians. TwoIsraeli soldiers and eight Lebanese were killed. The missingIsraelis were not found.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. force in south Lebanon,said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops were involved in thecurrent operation. Israeli sources said fewer than 1,000 soldierswere taking part.   Two guerrilla infiltrations into Israel last week brought to 12the number that have taken place since Nov. 25, when a Palestinianguerrilla landed a hang glider near an Israel military base andkilled six Israeli soldiers before being shot to death.   Israeli officials say the increase in cross-border raids islinked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Goksel said soldiers had rolled into three villages in armoredpersonnel carriers and a few tanks, ordered residents out of theirhomes, then searched village houses. The Israeli newspaper Maarivquoted an army spokesman as saying bulldozers were brought in towreck houses of collaborators.   Another Lebanese police spokesman said reports from Lebanon'sArkoub region in the foothills of Mount Hermon indicated Israelitroops seized at least three suspected guerrillas.   An Israeli army spokeswoman, who cannot be identified accordingto Israeli law, said searches by the armored column were beingconcentrated in the Lebanese villages of Kfar Chouba, Chebaa andHebbariye, all within three miles of the Israeli border and insidethe 6-to-10-mile wide security zone.   The area was once known as ``Fatahland'' because Fatah, thelargest Palestine Liberation Organization faction, controlled itbefore Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978. The Israelis withdrew aboutthree months later. They invaded Lebanon again in 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
