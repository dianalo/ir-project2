Tien Shan are presented.The presence of ancient Archean formations in Middle Tien Shan is confirmed.The magmatic behaviour in Tien Shan on the verge of 1100, 710 and 465million years (Northen Tien Shan) and 830, 730, 690 million years (MiddleTien Shan) is detected. The obtained isotopic ages are in good agreementwith the geologic data. 12 refs.; 2 figs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
