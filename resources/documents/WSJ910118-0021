Crude oil for February delivery plummeted a record $10.56a barrel to $21.44 in trading on the New York MercantileExchange. That was 10 cents a barrel below the price lastAug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and touched offthe Persian Gulf crisis that led to the current conflict.Within minutes after the war began with U.S. air attacks onBaghdad early Wednesday evening EST, dealers in Tokyo werequoting West Texas intermediate crude as high as $40.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday's plunge in oil prices came before news of theattack on Israel.   Gold for February delivery skidded $30.10 a ounce to$374.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. It had spikedup to $412 an ounce in Australia and Hong Kong when war brokeout.   Volume was brisk in both commodities as traders scrambledto keep up with the markets' U-turns. Crude oil volume ofabout 116,000 futures contracts was 29% higher than the dailyaverage during the fourth quarter, and gold volume of 100,000contracts was nearly triple the normal turnover.   Yet both gold and oil behaved exactly as analysts andinvestors had been predicting for a month or more: War causedprices to rise, but then they declined as the U.S.-led alliedforces got the upper hand on Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Few,however, had expected the entire scenario to be played outovernight. Fund managers and retail speculators, inparticular, were caught flat-footed by the swift turnabouts.   &quot;Rather than a matter of days, the whole process wascompacted into a matter of hours,&quot; said William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch.   That was disastrous for commodity funds and pools, whichmostly try to play established price trends. &quot;They wereprobably long {on} gold and crude while short {on} the yenand soybeans,&quot; deduced Richard Dennis, one of the best-knownand most successful commodity traders. The trends were there,Mr. Dennis said, but &quot;the markets reversed with more than theusual vengeance.&quot;   Mr. Dennis himself took some lumps yesterday, not in goldbut in silver, which fell nearly 20 cents an ounce to justabove $4. But he shrugged off his silver losses, noting hehad fared well in Treasury bond options. All in all, it was&quot;definitely one of my better days in the market this year,&quot;he asserted.   Oil analysts said prices plunged in response to theapparent success of U.S. air strikes against Iraq, seeminglyeliminating the Iraqi military as a major threat to SaudiArabia's oil fields. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein hadthreatened to destroy those fields if attacked.   &quot;Once the Saudi fields and facilities were secure, the`war premium' evaporated, and the fundamentals of supply anddemand, which are pretty grim, reasserted themselves,&quot; saidJ. Robinson West, president of Washington-based PetroleumFinance Co.   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, wheretrading of crude set a record of more than 53,000 contracts,Brent North Sea oil for March delivery fell $9.27 a barrel to$19.70.   Ever since August, oil prices have been gyrating on fearsthat Iraq would be able to damage Saudi oil facilities oncewar began, disrupting world oil supplies and perhaps causingshortages. That led to a so-called war premium on oil prices,which has averaged around $10 a barrel.   But yesterday, after it was reported that Iraqi fire hadhit only a 200,000-barrel oil storage tank in Saudi Arabia,traders turned their attention to the oil glut that has beenbuilding. Even as recession in some major oil-consumingcountries cuts into demand, a pumping race continues in theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Some energy brokers criticized announcements by the U.S.Energy Department and the International Energy Agency ofplans to release oil from government stockpiles because ofthe war.   &quot;In a market with such bearish fundamentals, I wouldn't besurprised to see oil prices go down to the mid-teens,&quot; saidNauman Barakat, an energy-futures vice president at MerrillLynch.   Others said a sharp pricing correction had been due in theoil market. What happened, however, is that &quot;itovercorrected,&quot; said Antonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner andamp;Moore Management Science in Houston.   Meanwhile, gold traders were having their own troubles.Seeing the reversal in overseas trading, they braced forsharp declines at the opening of the New York session. &quot;Therewas a lot of action at the open,&quot; a Comex floor broker said.In these markets, he added, &quot;taking the first loss is thebest thing.&quot;   The February contract traded no higher than $380.80 anounce and closed near its low of $374.   &quot;Gold has definitely lost its reputation as a safe havenin times of uncertainty,&quot; said Philip Gotthelf, editor of theCommodity Futures Forecast, a Guttenberg, N.J., newsletter.   About the only development that could boost goldsubstantially now, he said, would be a worsening of the U.S.banking and financial system crisis or perhaps adeterioration in the situation in Germany and the rest ofEurope. Mr. Gotthelf said he sees gold trading between $350and $370 an ounce in the near term.   Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a NewYork-based metals consulting firm, said he isn't sure thatgold will find any support even at the $360 level.   Another bear on gold is August Arace, co-manager of theFreedom Gold andamp; Government Trust, an open-end mutual fund. &quot;Ithink the psychology of deflation is becoming much morepervasive,&quot; he said. He predicts that interest rates willstart falling world-wide because of slowing economies orrecessions, and this &quot;could force gold prices down to thecash-clearing mining cost of about $300&quot; an ounce.   To damp an expected increase in volatility during thePersian Gulf crisis, the Comex and New York Merc raisedrequirements for margin, or good-faith money that investorsmust put up to initiate trades. Many brokerage firms requireeven more than the minimum margin amounts from retailcustomers.   The Comex raised its margin requirement for gold futuresto $3,000 from $1,663 to initiate trades and to $2,500 from$1,250 to maintain speculative positions. The exchange alsosaid trading in gold, silver and copper will be suspendedwhen prices rise or fall by specified limits -- $75 an ouncefor gold, $1.50 an ounce for silver and 20 cents a pound forcopper.   Effective Wednesday, the New York Merc raised its initialmargin requirement for trading heating oil and unleadedgasoline futures contracts to $8,000 from $7,000.   As volatile as gold was yesterday, the drop was far frombeing a record. James Kneafsey, president of CambridgeFinancial Management, an institutional money management firm,said he remembers gold dropping $165 an ounce one night in1980. &quot;That's really a move,&quot; he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices moved higher in response tocontinuing strong export sales. The March contract settled at77.66 cents a pound, up 1.56 cents. Sandra Kaul, commodityanalyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said freshpurchases by China brought its total for the week to 48,500bales and for the season to 1,329,000 bales. U.S. exportsales for the week totaled 186,400 bales. Ms. Kaul said thatso far in the 1990-91 season, export commitments are6,643,000 bales, compared with an Agriculture Departmentestimate of 7.8 million for the entire season, which endsJuly 31. Exports totaled 7.7 million bales last year, but atthis point in the season they stood at only 5.5 millionbales. Ms. Kaul also said that in addition to the higherexport figures, cotton supplies are tighter. She said thefirst day of fighting in the Middle East raised hopes thatthe war wouldn't be a long one, lessening fears that demandwould be cut and that shippers wouldn't be able to meetcommitments. She also said she sees the market pushing toward80 cents a pound, with support at around 75 cents.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND LIVESTOCK: Grain futures prices rose in heavytrading on news of dry weather in South American soybeangrowing regions and massive buying by commodity funds.Analysts said funds moved out of traditional &quot;war hedge&quot;positions in such commodities as gold, silver and oil andinto grains, especially soybeans. The soybean contract forMarch delivery rose 6 3/4 cents to $5.7750 a bushel, theMarch wheat contract rose 4 1/2 cents to $2.54 a bushel, andMarch corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.4025 a bushel. News thatthe soybean crop in southern Brazil was suffering fromunseasonably dry weather drove the funds into soybeanfutures. Soybean futures prices, which had sunk to a one-yearlow on Monday, have rallied about 20 cents a bushel sincethen.
