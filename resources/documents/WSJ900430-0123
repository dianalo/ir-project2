At a summit meeting here, the 12 EC leaders agreed to seekways to create a more unified and efficient EC, with morejoint decision-making, greater democratic checks and balancesand a less cumbersome institutional structure. Though theyhave radically different visions about how much nationalsovereignty they are willing to transfer to a Europeangovernment, and how quickly, they agreed &quot;further decisivesteps should be taken&quot; toward a new EC structure.</LP><TEXT>   Foreign ministers will spend the next two monthscollecting and assessing ideas and definitions of politicalunion. The formal calling of the talks, which will runparallel with already-called negotiations about economic andmonetary union, is expected to take place at another ECsummit here June 25 and 26. But the wording of Saturday'ssummit communique leaves no doubt about an eventual callingof negotiations once a clearer plan evolves.   &quot;Today the Community firmly, decisively and categoricallycommitted itself to political union,&quot; said Irish PrimeMinister Charles Haughey, who chaired the meeting. &quot;For thatpurpose now, an intergovernmental conference will be held andwe will go on from there.&quot;   The leaders also agreed unanimously to a much quickertimetable for economic and monetary union negotiations thanoriginally planned. They said they will try to finish thetalks, which start in December, and the process of nationalratification of the new treaty by the end of 1992, tocoincide with the completion of the EC's single-marketprogram. Even after the treaty is in place, it will takeseveral years to introduce a system of central banks or asingle currency; but the agreement on a deadline for thetalks was considered a major boost for supporters of theplan. They also agreed to aim for a political union treaty tocome into force at the same time.   The agreements, issued in a 10-page joint communique, addup to some of the most ambitious and detailed plans theCommunity has ever set for itself. The summit not only setout the EC's vision for its own future, but issued ablueprint for the &quot;New Europe&quot; that is taking shape becauseof reforms in the East bloc. Among some of the key points ofthe agreement are the following:                                                                                                          German unification: The leaders welcomed East Germany intothe EC as part of a unified Germany and agreed on a policyand procedure to manage the integration of that country'sterritory and 16 million citizens into the legal and economicstructure of the Community. West German Chancellor HelmutKohl said the EC Commission would be involved in the planningand execution of the unification process to make sure Germanmonetary union and all other intra-German agreements are inkeeping with EC law and open to examination of the other ECmembers. He reassured the poorer members of the EC that theEast German bailout won't rob them of limited regionaldevelopment funds, and said a revived East Germany wouldbeneift the whole EC.                                                                                                          Eastern Europe: Ever-deeper contacts with reformingEastern European countries will remain conditional on thesecountries developing democratic, free-market systems. A newset of association agreements, which define closer economicand political ties, could result in eventual full membershipin the EC. It was agreed that aid provided by the Group of 24industrialized nations to this region, currently beingcoordinated by the EC Commission and limited to Poland andHungary, should be extended to East Germany (until its fullunification), Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria andRomania.                                                                                                          Relations with the U.S.: The leaders agreed to &quot;furtherdevelop close trans-Atlantic relations based on contacts atthe highest levels.&quot; This initiative, launched by ECCommission President Jacques Delors and U.S. Secretary ofState James Baker, foresees twice-yearly meetings of the U.S.president with the president of the EC council of ministers,two meetings a year between the EC foreign ministers and theU.S. secretary of state and high-level contacts between theU.S. administration and the EC Commission.   A surprisingly positive tone and agreement by BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher to go ahead with thepolitical talks reflects her belief that she will be able tohave a major influence on them.   According to senior British officials at the summitmeeting, she told the other leaders they needed to reassure&quot;worried&quot; publics that what was about to happen wouldn'tthreaten such things as national identity, national culture,language, electoral or legal systems.   Officials of other countries at the meeting said theyagreed with many of the excluded items on Mrs. Thatcher'slist, and that by clarifying what political union is not,Mrs. Thatcher probably had contributed to its ultimatesuccess. The EC won't scrap national parliaments orpresidents, and most expect the six monarchs of the EC tokeep their jobs.   Mrs. Thatcher also made some small steps in the directionof the supporters of more ambitious interpretation ofpolitical union. She said she would consider reducing theveto rights of individual states in EC decisions, allowingfor quicker and more efficient progress on legislation. Suchprocedures, already enshrined in the single market program,had served British interests well, she said. She also saidshe would consider changes in the treaty making it more clearwhat powers should be given to the EC and what powers shouldbe reserved for the member states.   But Mr. Kohl said the EC states had to be prepared toagree to more radical transformation of EC institutions,parliaments and decision-making processes than Mrs. Thatcherhad in mind.</TEXT></DOC>
