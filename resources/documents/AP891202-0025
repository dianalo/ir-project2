Eighty-five percent of union workers approved the contract withNynex Corp. The ratification Friday marked the final settlement ofstrikes against regional telephone companies that began in August.The strikes at one point involved 200,000 workers in 20 states.   The CWA's 40,000 regional members struck Nynex subsidiary NewYork Telephone. New England Telephone, another Nynex subsidiary,was struck by 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers.   The IBEW settled first, and its workers returned to work lastmonth.   ``We are very pleased,'' Nynex spokesman John Bonomo said, afterthe CWA ratification vote. ``The settlement is fair for everyone _customers, employees and shareholders. We're looking forward towelcoming all our employees back to work on Monday, and dedicatingourselves to providing the quality service our customers rely on usfor.''   The rancorous Nynex walkout left one striker dead after a picketline confrontation; the company reported hundreds of instances ofsabotage against its equipment. The strike created long delays forpeople and companies seeking new telephone installations.   The major point of contention concerned the company's insistencethat workers share part of their health costs. But the finalsettlement did not include any health-cost sharing.</TEXT></DOC>
