Interested persons were invited to submit comments by September27, 1982. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial commentperiod could be submitted by October 27, 1982. In accordance with andSection;330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, four manufacturerssubmitted comments and one manufacturer submitted a reply comment. Copiesof the comments received are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above). In order to conform to terminology used in the OTC drug review regulations(21 CFR 330.10), the present document is designated as a ``tentative finalmonograph.'' Its legal status, however, is that of a proposed rule. Inthis tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Subpart G ofPart 358 (21 CFR Part 358; proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 3, 1982; 47 FR 39108) FDA statesfor the first time its position on the establishment of a monograph forOTC pediculicide drug products. Final agency action on this matter willoccur with the publication at a future date of a final monograph, whichwill be a final rule establishing a monograph for OTC pediculicide drugproducts. This proposal constitutes FDA's tentative adoption of the Panel's conclusionsand recommendations on OTC pediculicide drug products as modified on thebasis of the comments received and the agency's independent evaluationof the Panel's report. Modifications have been made for clarity and regulatoryaccuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has beenplaced on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Thesemodifications are reflected in the following summary of the comments andFDA's responses to them.The OTC procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that any testingnecessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerly resultedin a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the resultsof that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemakingprocess before the establishment of a final monograph. Accordingly, FDAwill no longer use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safeand effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (not generally recognizedas safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available dateare insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testingis required) at the final monograph stage, but will use instead the terms``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonograph conditions''(old Categories II and III). This document retains the concepts of CategoriesI, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage.The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products thatare subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe andeffective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after that date, no OTC drug product thatis subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognizedas safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unlessit is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug productssubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC pediculicide drugproducts (published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 29, 1982, 47 FR 28312), the agency suggestedthat the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Experience has shown that relabeling of productscovered by the monograph is necessary in order for manufacturers to complywith the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have tobe written, ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturingprocess. The agency has determined that it is impractical to expect newlabeling to be in effect 6 months after the date of publication of thefinal monograph. Experience has shown also that if the deadline for relabelingis too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and relatedpaperwork.In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to comply withthe monograph. Reformulation often involves the need to do stability testingon the new product. An accelerated aging process may be used to test anew formulation; however, if the stability testing is not successful, andif further reformulation is required, there could be a further delay inhaving a new product available for manufacture.The agency wishes to establish a reasonable period of time for relabelingand reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the marketplacethat could not only result in economic loss, but also interfere with consumers'access to safe and effective drug products. Therefore, the agency is proposingthat the final monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The agency believes that within 12 months afterthe date of publication most manufacturers can order new labeling and reformulatetheir products and have them in compliance in the marketplace.If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included inthe final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effectivedate, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety problemis identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadlinemay be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products.All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31697) and August27, 1975 (40 FR 38179) or to additional information that has come to theagency's attention since publication of the advance notice of proposedrulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>1. One comment submitted a copy of a label of an OTC aerosol pediculicidedrug product, Personal Insecticide, bearing an Environmental ProtectionAgency registration number and which to the best of the comment's knowledgewas being marketed for use on humans, and requested information regardingthe procedure for registering this type of product with FDA.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 5, 1979 (44 FR 63749), the UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final regulationto clarify its policy regarding the registration of pesticide products(which included pediculicide products) that are not new drugs or new animaldrugs. Basically, EPA has jurisdiction over pesticide products marketedOTC and used as pediculicides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and regulations in 40 CFR Part 162, whereasFDA has jurisdiction over pediculicide drug products under the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and regulations in 21 CFR Parts314 and 330. Section 162.5(d)(1) of EPA's regulations (40 CFR 162.5(d)(1))provides that a pesticide, such as pyrethrins, is exempt from the requirementsof FIFRA if the product is offered solely for human use and is a new drugwithin the meaning of section 201(p) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321) or hasbeen determined not to be a new drug by the Secretary of Health and HumanServices by a regulation establishing conditions for use of the product.At the present time, FDA has not declared pediculicide products containingpyrethrins to be new drugs nor established conditions for use of theseproducts in a regulation. Therefore, EPA currently has jurisdiction oversuch products. However, as the EPA final rule explains (see 44 FR 63749),when FDA develops a monograph, products meeting its conditions will beexempt from FIFRA registration. Therefore, the tentative final monographin this document, when finalized, would be an FDA regulation that establishesconditions for use of these products and, thus, would exempt pediculicidedrug products containing pyrethrins from the requirements of FIFRA. Accordingly,once the final monograph becomes effective, a pesticide product containingpyrethrins labeled for use as an OTC pediculicide drug product for humanuse would no longer be under EPA's jurisdiction, but would have to conformto the labeling requirements of the final monograph. In the meantime, apediculicide drug product may receive either FDA approval for marketingvia a new drug application (NDA) under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C.355) and 21 CFR Part 314 or EPA approval for marketing under 40 CFR Part162.2. Two comments contended that aerosol forms of pediculicide drug productscontaining ``OTC concentrations'' of pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxidecan be safely marketed as OTC drugs (Refs. 1 and 2). One of the commentsstated that pulmonary absorption of any significant percentage of aerosolizedpyrethrins and other potentially harmful product constituents can be minimizedby utilizing an applicator and a method of application which restrict deliveryof the aerosol ``solely'' to the infested area, and, additionally, by minimizingthe number of aerosol particles below about 15 microns in diameter (Ref.1). The comment referred to a specific aerosolized pediculicide drug productwith an applicator which facilitates application in close proximity toskin and scalp to ensure essentially complete dermal impaction of the drug.The applicator generates an aerosol particle size distribution such thatless than 2 percent of the delivered aerosol (by weight) is comprised ofparticles smaller than 16 microns in diameter and presents no inhalationtoxicity problem. The comment stated that if all the aerosolized particlesunder 16 microns in size that are present in one average effective treatmentusing this product were absorbed systemically, they would represent approximately0.15 milligram (mg) pyrethrins or less than 1/1,000,000 of the estimatedLD<T2>50</T2> in humans. The comment added that untoward chance contact ofthe product with mucous membrane can be minimized by delivery of the aerosolvia use of a special applicator, limiting small, inhalable particle distribution,and by closing the mouth and eyes and covering the facial area with a dampcloth during spraying. The comment stated that an average patient treatmentof head lice infestation requires five 1-second atomizations which approximate2.25 grams (g) of the product, representing 7.5 mg pyrethrin extract and62 mg piperonyl butoxide. The comment referred to the toxicity data (oraltoxicity studies in mice and inhalation studies in rats and guinea pigs)previously submitted (Ref. 3) and stated that these data support the safetyof the aerosol product. The comments concluded that broad internationalexperience with this product has confirmed its safety as an OTC drug product.The agency has reviewed the data previously submitted (Ref. 3), the Panel'sstatements, and the additional data and information submitted by the comments(Refs. 1 and 2) and has determined that the data are sufficient to establishthe safety of aerosolized OTC pediculicide drug products as an alternativesuitable dosage form provided that (1) an appropriate applicator is usedwhich facilitates application of the product in close proximity to theaffected area, (2) less than 2 percent of the delivered aerosol (by weight)is comprised of particles smaller that 16 microns in diameter, (3) thelabeling states that the mouth and eyes are closed during application andthe facial area is appropriately covered (e.g., with a damp cloth duringspraying), (4) the labeling based upon adequate data, states an appropriatetime period during which the product can be safely and effectively usedbefore washing off the affected area, and (5) the directions provide foran initial treatment followed by a second treatment in 7 to 10 days tokill any nits that may have hatched. Although the proposed labeling submittedto the Panel (Ref. 3) contained directions for treatment and preventativetreatment, the agency has determined that the data do not support the useof aerosolized pediculicides every third day for prevention of lice infestation.Additional safety data for such use in aerosol and nonaerosol dosage formswould be needed to establish a preventative treatment claim.The agency's evaluation of the data follows:Using an aerosol product containing 0.33 percent pyrethrins and 2.67 percentpiperonyl butoxide in petroleum oil, Mercier (Ref. 1) conducted four trials:(1) <T3>Acute toxicity after oral administration to albino mice. </T3>Thistest was intended to determine toxicity in case of accidental ingestionor the vaporization of massive doses of the product on foodstuffs.The LD<T2>50</T2> was determined to be 8.77 grams/kilogram (g/kg). On histologicalexamination only half of the controls, which had been given only 0.2 milliliter(mL)/20 g of olive oil, showed moderate steatosis of the liver while thetreated animals all showed an excess of hepatic lipids. The excess wasnot always in proportion to the dose given. Nevertheless, vacuolation ofthe cytoplasm accompanied the excess lipids but no other inflammatory orsclerotic deterioration of the liver was found.(2) <T3>Trial to determine any possible toxic effect after inhalation of massivedoses. </T3>This test was conducted to demonstrate the bronchopulmonaryor general toxicity by atomizing the product in a 4,700 liter semi-closedchamber containing guinea pigs and albino Wistar rats. The animals breathedthe aerosol for 15 minutes during atomization and were kept in the chamberfor 15 minutes after atomization. The animals were then observed for 1week. This experiment showed that inhalation of large doses causes bronchopulmonary,bucconasal, and ocular irritation in test animals. The irritant effectswere reversible within a few hours and did not lead to any lethal effect.(3) <T3>Trial to determine any toxic effect after inhalation of low dosagesand the ingestion of food on which the vaporized material has fallen. </T3>Thisexperiment was conducted to determine whether the atomization of largequantities of the product into a room or the use of the aerosol, withoutprecaution, could have a toxic effect.Six female albino Wistar rats and 12 female albino Swiss mice, in ordinarycages, were placed in a room with a volume of 43 cubic meters. Over a 15-minuteperiod, the contents of four 90 g containers were atomized near the animals.The animals were monitored every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every 30 minutesfor 3 hours for 4 days, in the same room where atomization occurred. Thisexperiment showed that low doses of aerosol do cause moderate eye irritationand bucconasal irritation. Neither congestion of the eyes nor nasal orsalivary hypersecretion was found. Also, there was no sign of bronchopulmonaryirritation resulting in cough or dyspnea. No lethal effect due to inhalationof the product or to the ingestion of food on which it had fallen was observed.(4) <T3>Local tolerance of the finished product in macaca monkeys. </T3>Eachday except Sunday, three females and one male were given an atomizationof the product using the nozzle intended for treatment of the occipitalregion. Each spray lasted 10 seconds, and a total of 18 atomizations weregiven.Daily spraying for 3 weeks did not cause lesions in the treated area. Theskin did not show any inflammatory reaction and no desquamation. No anomalywas found in the pilary system. The aerosol product did not appear to causeirritation to mucous membranes; there were no bouts of sneezing, wateringeyes, or rhinorrhea. The 10-second spraying did not appear to cause reactionswhich could correspond with a painful or disagreeable sensation.After reviewing the submitted data, the agency finds that the animal studiessubmitted support the safety of an aerosolized dosage form for human treatmentuse. Based on the above discussion, at this time, the agency is classifyingaerosolized pediculicides for treatment use in Category I for safety. Preventativetreatment use is being classified in Category III for safety. The effectivenessof these products (Category III) is discussed in comment 3 below. Shouldaerosolized pediculicides be included in the monograph, the agency willpropose appropriate standards at that time.References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00002, Docket No. 81N-201, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Comment No. C00004, Docket No. 81N-0201, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) OTC Volume 160403.</ITAG>3. One comment stated that FDA should only consider an aerosol as a methodof administration of a pediculicide on the basis of a full NDA in whichclinical studies of the effectiveness of the aerosol are compared withthat of currently approved methods of treatment. The comment argued thatspraying the hair with an aerosol would require a probe to get the sprayto the scalp area, that using this technique would be extremely difficultto cover adequately all areas of the scalp, and that delivery of the medicationonto the lice and nits could not be assured. The comment contended thatadequate coverage of a topically applied medication requires the use ofa liquid which will bring the active ingredient to the entire scalp andhair. The comment added that inadequate treatment, such as might be providedvia the use of an aerosol, could result in the exposure of lice to sublethallevels of the drug and that, over a period of many generations, adaptivemechanisms could enable the lice to withstand what originally had beena lethal concentration of drug.A reply comment stated that its aerosol pediculicide product with a uniqueapplicator has been used extensively and effectively outside the UnitedStates. The reply comment argued that the adequacy of distribution of aerosolizedparticles over the infested (``scalp'') area, and the completeness of effectivecontact of the drug with infesting parasites, is supported not only byefficacy as an OTC pediculicide, but also by laboratory studies and humanclinical evaluation (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). The reply comment added that twoCanadian researchers compared the ovicidal activity of its aerosol productwith other pediculicides marketed in Canada and showed a 100-percent ovicidalactivity of the product (Ref. 4).Based on the submitted data, the reply comment concluded that its aerosolpediculicide with unique applicator appears to be at least as effectiveas nonaerosol pediculicide products marketed in the United States. Accordingly,the reply comment stated that the comment's suggestion that an aerosolpyrethrin pediculicide (with suitable applicator) would provide inferiortherapy for head lice infestations, and hence increase the potential fordevelopment of pyrethrin-resistant strains of lice, is not valid. The replycomment indicated that it was unaware of any reported development of significantresistance to pyrethrin-piperonyl butoxide formulations, that its experimentalevidence indicates greater effectiveness for aerosol-administered pyrethrins,and that aerosol administration might reduce the change of ineffectivetreatment and development of parasite resistance.The agency has evaluated the studies submitted by the reply comment. Inone study, Timon-David (Ref. 1) investigated the activity of an aerosolformulation containing 0.33 percent pyrethrins and 2.67 percent piperonylbutoxide in vitro against head, body, and public lice using three techniquesof exposure: (1) Immersion of the lice in the spray premix (total formulationless propellant), (2) placement of the lice in a Petri dish containinga cotton disk impregnated with spray premix, and (3) spraying of the licewith a ``microfog'' generated by an aerosol container.Using the immersion technique, 10 body lice (then 10 head lice, then 5pubic lice) were placed into each of 10 dishes containing 5 mL of pyrethrinsand piperonyl butoxide with petroleum oil. The closed dishes were incubatedat 28anddegrees;C at 60 percent humidity in the dark, as were the dishescontaining untreated controls. The male and female lice of the three speciesdied in under 5 minutes (100 percent killed), while the control lice survivedfor longer than 72 hours.Using a 5.5-centimeters (cm) disc of cotton impregnated with the same pyrethrinmixture, the disc in five dishes were impregnated with 0.1 mL of the mixturewhile the discs in another five dishes were impregnated with 0.2 mL ofthe mixture. A group of 10 head lice (then 10 body lice, then 5 pubic lice)were placed into each dish with no distinction between males and females.The dishes were closed and placed in the dark and incubated at 28anddegrees;Cand 60 percent humidity. The survival of the lice was monitored with alow-power binocular microscope every 5 minutes. The untreated lice survivedfor over 72 hours while the lice treated with the 0.2 mL solution were100 percent killed in under 10 minutes. The head and body lice were moresensitive and were 100 percent killed in under 5 minutes. In the 0.1 mLsolution treated dishes, head and body lice were 100 percent killed inunder 30 minutes while the pubic lice were 100 percent killed in under45 minutes.The technique using the ``microfog'' generated from the aerosol containermost nearly approaches the conditions of use in vivo. Each species of louse(head, body, and pubic) was divided into three lots. The first lot wasgiven a 2-second atomization, 25 cm from the lice-containing dishes. Thesecond lot was given a 5-second atomization at 25 cm, while the third lotwas given a 15-second atomization at 25 cm. Using the applicator nozzle,100 percent kill was achieved in under 15 minutes. The 5- and 15-secondatomizations were too long a period on the small surface area of the petriedish and resulted in the lice lying paralyzed and drowned in the test solutioncomparable to the conditions in the immersion technique. However, the 15-secondatomization corresponds with the time necessary to carry out the completespraying of the average scalp. Timon-David concluded that the comparativeeffect (of equal quantities of drug) was much more rapid via aerosol application.He attributed this observation to the ``immediate contact'' of the micromistwith the whole of the cerolipid cuticle of the insect and the micromist'srapid penetration of the respiratory system leading to more rapid paralysisand death. Timon-David also demonstrated that eggs of the respective parasitespecies were killed in under three to five hours when treated with a 2-secondspray of the aerosol, larvae which had reached the hatching stage werekilled on hatching, and larvae treated at an earlier stage of developmentwere killed in situ without development to the hatching stage.In a second controlled study, Coz (Ref. 2) studied the activity of theaerosol against a strain of body louse adapted to the rabbit, includinglice of different ages (nymphs and adults) and eggs. The age of treatedlice varied between 4 and 48 days with adults considered as being over14 days of age. Each lot of lice, placed on a fabric support, was treatedwith a 2-second spray containing 0.33 percent pyrethrins and 2.67 percentpiperonyl butoxide. The lice were left in contact with the product forperiods varying between 2 to 5 minutes. When the time of contact had elapsed,the lice were washed with water to simulate usual conditions of use ofthe material. Lots of control lice, similar in age to the treated lice,were kept under conditions similar to those of the lots treated by sprayingwith the aerosol. The controls were also given a water wash. The numberof dead lice on rabbits was recorded after 24 hours. During the periodof observation the lice were kept on fabric, incubated at 28anddegrees;Cwith 70 to 80 percent humidity. In the control lice, 12.4 percent deadinsects occurred from natural causes while the aerosol treated lice reflecteda death rate of 100 percent independent of age and of time of contact betweenthe parasite and the mixture of active ingredients. The efficacy of theaerosol is complete even for periods of less than 2 minutes.Eggs of body lice were treated on a fabric support with a 2-second sprayof the aerosol and left in contact with the material for 2, 5, or 10 minutes.After the contact period, the lice eggs were washed with water to simulateusual conditions of use. Each treated lot was paired with a control lot.The eggs were incubated at 28 anddegrees;C with 70 to 80 percent humidity.Every day except Sunday, the cloths supporting the eggs were placed onthe shaved stomach of a rabbit. Hatching occurred over several days. Theday on which the maximum number of hatched lice were seen was chosen forthe determination of the percentage hatch. Analysis of the results showedthat with a 2-minute contact time a hatch of 0 percent of the eggs wasobtained from 328 eggs treated with the aerosol whereas, for the controllots, the mean level of 44.4 percent hatchings from 408 eggs occurred.With a 5-minute contact time, 0 percent eggs hatched from 391 treated eggscompared to a mean level of 55.7 percent hatches from 406 control eggs.With a 10-minute contact time, 0 percent eggs hatched from 353 treatedeggs while the mean level of hatching for the control was 62.81 percentfrom 449 eggs.In the third study, Privat (Ref. 3) treated 118 patients having pediculosis(90 with head lice, 26 with public lice, and 2 with body lice) with theaerosol product containing 0.33 percent pyrethrins and 2.6 percent piperonylbutoxide. Treatment consisted of a series of 1-second atomizations in sucha way as to cover the whole of the hair or the hair-covered areas. Aftera 24-hour contact period, the hair or hair covered areas were washed twoto three times followed by rinsing. A single treatment was considered sufficientprovided the individual was not re-exposed to infestation and providedthere was regular clinical supervision for the four weeks following treatmentto reveal any possible failure in the therapy. Of the 113 patients availablefor followup evaluation, 109 showed complete eradication of parasitosis.In only four cases (two head lice and two public lice) was there a reappearanceof infestation; however, the investigator was unable to determine whetherthese recurrences were treatment failures or reinfestations following effectivetreatment.Although the reply comment referred to a personal communication with twoCanadian researchers, no details of the communication were provided (Ref.4). Because no data were provided to confirm the claimed 100 percent ovicidalactivity of the aerosol under experimental conditions, the agency cannotdetermine the validity of this claim and any reference to these researchers'findings cannot be used to support the effectiveness of the aerosol product.The agency has also considered the comment's arguments that an aerosolwould not provide adequate treatment, that an aerosol would not bring theactive ingredient to the entire scalp and hair, and that an aerosol wouldcause formation of sublethal levels of drug which would cause a toleranceto be developed over generations; however, because the comment did notdocument its arguments, the agency cannot fully address them. Instead,the agency welcomes the submission of data and comments addressing thesearguments. Any comments submitted will be addressed in the final monograph.The agency believes that most of these questions would be answered by additionalclinical studies.The agency finds that the two laboratory studies (Refs. 1 and 2) are supportiveof the effectiveness of the aerosolized pediculicide; however, they arenot adequate to establish general recognition of effectiveness. Althoughthe clinical study (Ref. 3) did demonstrate the effectiveness of an aerosolform of pyrethrins/piperonyl butoxide after 24 hours, the study was notcomparable to the directions contained in the labeling proposed for theaerosol product i.e., that the treated area should be shampooed 30 minutesafter application of the product. In addition, because the aerosolizedpediculicide product was allowed to act for 24 hours, there are no datademonstrating at which point in time the product was effective. Data areneeded to demonstrate an appropriate time period for which an aerosolizedpediculicide drug product must remain on the affected area in order tobe effective before it is then washed off. It should be further noted that,based upon the safety data, the Panel recommended that products containingpyrethrins/piperonyl butoxide be limited to topical use for 10 minutesbut no longer (47 FR 28315-28319). If new data demonstrating effectivenessindicate that a longer period of exposure is necessary for effective treatment,additional safety data may be necessary. Any new data submitted shouldinclude information as to any observed adverse effects. Therefore, at thistime the agency is proposing a Category III classification for effectivenessfor treatment use of aerosolized pediculicide products containing pyrethrinsand piperonyl butoxide.References<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Timon-David, P., ``Report on Parasitological Trial,'' Centre DeRecherche D'Applications Pharmaceutiques, Laboratoires Applipharm, Marseille,March, 1979, in Reply Comment coded RC0001, Docket No. 81N-0201, DocketsManagement Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Coz, J., ``Report on a Supplementary Parasitological ExperimentalTrial,'' Centre De Recherche D'Applications Pharmaceutiques, LaboratoiresApplipharm, Marseille, February, 1979, in Reply Comment coded RC0001, DocketNo. 81N-0201, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Privat, Y., ``Clinical Trial of the Activity and Tolerance ofthe Para 2 Aerosol,'' Centre De Recherche D'Applications Pharmaceutiques,Laboratoires Applipharm, Marseille, October, 1979, in Reply Comment codedRC0001, Docket No. 81N-0201, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Reply Comment coded RC0001, Docket No. 81N-0201, Dockets ManagementBranch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) OTC Volume 160403.</ITAG>4. One comment contended that using the term ``pediculicide'' may be meaninglessto many persons and suggested that the phrase ``for lice control'' wouldbe a better statement of identity.  The agency agrees with the comment that the term ``pediculicide'' may notbe well understood by many consumers. If manufacturers wish to use thetechnical term as the statement of identity, the agency believes it shouldbe used with a nontechnical term that would be understood by consumers.Alternatively, the nontechnical term used alone would be an adequate statementof identity.  The agency has determined that ``lice treatment'' would be a more appropriatenontechnical term than the phrase ``for lice control'' because ``treatment''language is more consistent with the indications for use of these productsand is similar to other statements of identity which the agency has proposedin other OTC drug rulemakings, e.g., ``nocturnal leg muscle cramps treatment''or ``pinworm treatment.''

Accordingly, the following statements of identityare being proposed in andSection;358.650(b) of this tentative final monograph:``pediculicide (lice treatment)'' or ``lice treatment.''  The agency has no objection to terms such as ``for lice control'' appearingelsewhere in the labeling provided they do not appear in any portion ofthe labeling required by the monograph and do not detract from the requiredinformation. The agency believes that this approach will minimize the likelihoodof confusion.  5. Referring to the Panel's recommended indication in andSection;358.650(b),one comment stated that the term ``body lice'' is a misnomer because ``bodylice do not live on the body but rather in the clothing, going to the bodyonly for feeding.'' The comment contended that body lice are almost exclusivelyconfined to persons who do not regularly change their clothing and, accordingly,it would not be necessary to treat the body with a pediculicide but wouldonly be necessary to launder the clothing in hot water (135 anddegrees;F)for 10 minutes or more. Therefore, the comment recommended that the agencynot include the indication for body lice in the tentative final monograph. The agency disagrees with the comment's contention that the term ``bodylice'' is a misnomer. ``Body lice'' is an appropriate and commonly acceptedname for blood-sucking lice particularly affecting the skin on the waistand armpits where there is close contact between garment and wearer (47FR 28314 to 28315). At any given time, some lice will be in the clothing,but others, during feeding time, will be on the body. Even though bodylice can be removed by changing clothing and laundering the infested clothesin hot water, as suggested by the comment, any lice that were feeding onthe body would remain to reinfest other clothing. Accordingly, the agencybelieves that it would be inadequate treatment to only launder clothesin hot water without treating the body at the same time with a pediculicide.Therefore, the agency is including the Panel's recommended indication ``for* * * body lice'' in the tentative final monograph.  6. Stating that ``it is important that the entire scalp and hair are coveredwith the product,'' one comment suggested that the first sentence of thedirections recommended by the Panel in andSection;358.650(d) be revised asfollows: ``Apply to the hair and scalp until all the hair is thoroughlywet with the product.''  The agency agrees in substance with the comment's suggested revision, i.e.,that the affected area, whether scalp, body, or pubic area, should be coveredwith the pediculicide drug product until all the hair is thoroughly wet.However, the comment's suggested revision to include the term ``scalp''would refer only to treatment of head lice, whereas the intent of the directionsin andSection;358.650(d) is to provide a general direction that is applicablefor the treatment of all lice that affect humans, i.e., head lice, bodylice, and pubic lice. Therefore, in this tentative final monograph, thefirst sentence of the directions in andSection;358.650(d) is not being modifiedas suggested by the comment.  7. Contending that pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide need not necessarilybe limited to formulation as a lotion, one comment suggested that the directionsrecommended by the Panel in andSection;358.650(d), which in part read ``Washarea thoroughly with warm water and soap or shampoo,'' be revised to providefor products which are formulated in a shampoo base. The comment pointedout the marketing of an EPA-approved product formulated with pyrethrinsand piperonyl butoxide in a shampoo base and contended that it would beunnecessary to add soap or shampoo, but merely water. The comment thereforesuggested that for products formulated in a shampoo base the directionsfor use should provide for alternate wording, such as, ``Add sufficientwarm water to form a lather and shampoo as usual.''  The agency agrees with the comment that specific directions should be includedin the tentative final monograph for pediculicide shampoo products. Therefore,the agency is revising the directions in andSection;358.650(d) as suggestedby the comment. Regarding the comment's reference to an EPA approved product,the agency notes that EPA has the authority to regulate these productspending the promulgation of a final FDA monograph on OTC pediculicide drugproducts. (See comment 1 above.)  8. Referring to that part of the Panel's recommended labeling in andSection;358.650(e)(1)that states ``Personal articles of clothing or bedding that cannot be washedmay be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for a period of about twoweeks,'' one comment pointed out the marketing of several EPA-approvedaerosol sprays containing either pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide orone of several pyrethroids intended to kill lice on personal articles.The comment contended that the use of these products would eliminate theneed to quarantine bedding or objects that can be neither washed nor dry-cleaned.The comment suggested that andSection;358.650(e)(1) be revised to providefor the use of these products by adding the following sentence: ``In lieuof this, such articles can be treated with an aerosol product specificallydesigned for this purpose.''      The agency agrees with the comment's suggestion; however, because not allof the products used as sprays to treat inanimate objects are aerosols,i.e., some are pump sprays, the agency is revising the sentence suggestedby the comment for clarity and is including it in andSection; 358.650(e)(1)of the tentative final monograph. Section 358.650(e)(1) will now read asfollows: ``Personal articles of clothing or bedding that cannot be washedmay be dry-cleaned, sealed in a plastic bag for a period of about 2 weeks,or sprayed with a product specifically designed for this purpose.''<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

That policy statement includes proceduresfor the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings withindustry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submittedtest data and other information.<T3>B. Summary of the Agency's Changes in the Panel's Recommendations </T3>FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and concludesthat it will tentatively adopt the Panel's report and recommended monographwith the changes described in FDA's responses to the comments above andwith other changes described in the summary below. A summary of the changesmade by the agency follows. 1. The agency has determined that effectiveness of aerosolized productscontaining pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide has not been established atthis time. Such products are classified in Category III in this rulemaking.The treatment use of aerosolized pediculicides is Category I for safety.Preventative treatment use is being classified in Category III for safety.(See comments 2 and 3 above.) 2. In the Panel's discussion of pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide (47FR 28315 to 28319), the Panel noted that pyrethrins are brown, viscous,liquid oleoresins that must be extracted and then refined. Pyrethrins areobtained from the flowers of <T3>Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium </T3>and that extraction produces twopyrethrin fractions_pyrethrins I which contains the esters of chrysanthemicacid (pyrethrin I, cinerin I, and jasmolin I) and pyrethrins II which containsthe esters of pyrethric acid (pyrethrin II, cinerin II, and jasmolin II).The pyrethrin content ranges from 0.7 percent to as high as 3 percent withthe active constituents reaching their highest concentration in matureflower heads. There are two methods of extracting the crude oleoresin withthe pyrethrum concentration varying from 25 to 35 percent. The reductionand refinement of the crude oleoresin containing the pyrethrins producesa light-colored relatively nonstaining extract. The Panel described twomethods of refinement which use a low temperature process to decrease thepossibility that the molecular structure of the pyrethrins will change.These processes have a high recovery of pyrethrins (about 95 percent);however, there are other methods in which the percent of pyrethrins recoveredis not as great. The active insecticidal constituents of pyrethrum flowers have been identifiedas four compounds: cinerin I, cinerin II, pyrethrin I, and pyrethrin II(Ref. 1). The first and third of these compounds are esters of chrysanthemummonocarboxylic acid with the alcohols cinerolone and pyrethrolone; thesecond and fourth are esters of the same alcohols with chrysanthemum dicarboxylicacid. The monocarboxylic acid esters are claimed to be more effective (Ref.1). In discussing the results of a study submitted to the Panel (Ref. 2),an investigator noted that one factor to be considered in interpretingresults is the fact that pyrethrins are natural products consisting of6 esters with potency (``activity'') variability. In this study, the investigatoralso noted that ``although each pyrethrum-containing product was testedat least three times, different lot-numbered products were used for eachseparate test. Thus, activity varied within products. However, the findingsof this study are consistent across separate experiments.'' Nevertheless, the agency is concerned that before general recognition ofthe safety and effectiveness of these pyrethrins can be established, thecomposition of the pyrethrins must be more clearly defined. The agency'sconcerns, as discussed above, were communicated in a letter to each interestedparty who had previously submitted data on the composition of pyrethrins(Refs. 3 through 8). Subsequently, data were submitted by a manufacturers'association (Ref. 9). Those data have been reviewed and the agency hasdetermined that, while the data provide a broader understanding of thecomposition of the pyrethrin fractions and suggest that there is littledisconformity in potency, variation is possible. It is because of the possibilityof potency variations that the agency believes that extracts derived fromdifferent purification processes should be compared with caution in termsof pyrethrins recovery and chemical composition and should be comparedin terms of biological activity (Ref. 10). Further, the agency is concernedthat these compounds are heat and light sensitive, prone to oxidation,and tend to become increasingly unstable with increasing concentrationand purity (Ref. 10). The agency believes that it would be appropriatefor interested parties to develop with the United States PharmacopeialConvention (USPC) suitable standards for the quality and purity of pyrethrins.Accordingly, the agency has referred the data to the USPC for consideration(Ref. 11). In this tentative final monograph, pyrethrins are proposed inCategory I. However, should interested parties fail to provide necessaryinformation so that an appropriate standard may be established, pyrethrinswill not be included in a final monograph. In order for pyrethrins to be generally recognized as safe and effectiveas a pediculicide, the agency must have sufficient data on the compositionand concentration of the different pyrethrin constituents and the quantity(range) of each that is contained in marketed products. For an ingredientor mixture to be included in an OTC drug final monograph, it is necessaryto have publicly available chemical information that can be used by allmanufacturers to determine that the ingredient is appropriate for use intheir products.

The agency is expanding the statement of identity so that these productscan now be identified as a ``pediculicide (lice treatment)'' or ``licetreatment.'' (See comment 4 above.) 4. The agency is adding directions in the tentative final monograph forthe use of pediculicide products formulated as shampoos. (See comment 7above.) 5. The agency is revising the Panel's recommended ``Other required statements''in andSection; 358.650(e)(1) by adding the phrase * * * or sprayed with aproduct specifically designed for this purpose * * *'' in order to providefor the use of EPA approved spray products that eliminate the need to quarantinebedding or objects that can be neither washed nor dry-cleaned. (See comment8 above.) 6. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in anumber of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor''for ``physician'' in OTC drug monographs on the basis that the word ``doctor''is more commonly used and better understood by consumers. Based on commentsreceived to these proposals, the agency has determined that final monographsand any applicable OTC drug regulation will give manufacturers the optionof using either the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This tentativefinal monograph proposes that option. 7. In the warnings section, the agency is adding the statement ``For externaluse only.'' Use of this statement is consistent with a number of otherOTC drug monographs for topical drug products. (See, for example, the tentativefinal monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products (February 8, 1983;48 FR 5852); the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drugproducts (February 15, 1983; 48 FR 6820); and the final monograph for OTCtopical otic drug products (August 8, 1986; 51 FR 28656).) Based on thewarning against use of a pediculicide near the eyes, the agency is alsoproposing the statement, ``Consult a doctor if infestation of eyebrowsor eyelashes occurs,'' to provide additional information for consumers.Accordingly, the warning in andSection; 358.650(c)(2) will now read as follows:``For external use only. Do not use near the eyes or permit contact withmucous membranes. If product gets into the eyes, immediately flush withwater. Consult a doctor if infestation of eyebrows or eyelashes occurs.''The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat not one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC pediculicidedrug products, is a major rule.The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354). That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC pediculicide drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposedrule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC pediculicidedrug products. No comments on economic impacts were received. Any commentson the agency's initial determination of the economic consequences of thisproposed rulemaking should be submitted by August 1, 1989. The agency willevaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and will reassessthe economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.The agency has determined that under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this actionis of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significantimpact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency publisheda final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications foruse of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labelingof OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuouslocation, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use establishedunder an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing such indications for usethat meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling,which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVEDUSES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which mayappear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternativelanguage describing indications for use that is not false or misleading,which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug labelingrequired by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity,warnings, and directions) must appear in the specific wording establishedunder the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language hasbeen established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63or 330.1(g). The proposed rule in this document is subject to the labelingprovisions in andSection; 330.1(c)(2).Interested persons may, on or before June 2, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. Arequest for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and timerequested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determinationmay be submitted on or before Agusut 1, 1989. Three copies of all comments,objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this documentand may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections,and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4>Interested persons, on or before April 3, 1990, may also submit in writingnew data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditionsnot classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submittedon or before June 4, 1990. These dates are consistent with the time periodsspecified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulationsfor reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copiesof all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified withthe docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Dataand comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Receiveddata and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and4 p.m., Monday through Friday.In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consideronly data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record onJune 4, 1990. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative recordwill be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, unless the Commissioner finds good cause hasbeen shown that warrants earlier consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 358</ITAG>Labeling, Over-the counter drugs, Pediculicide drug products.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the AdministrativeProcedure Act, it is proposed that Subchapter D of Chapter I of Title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended in Part 358 (proposed inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 3, 1982; 47 FR 39108), by addingnew Subpart G, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 358_MISCELLANEOUS EXTERNAL DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTERHUMAN USE</ITAG>1.
