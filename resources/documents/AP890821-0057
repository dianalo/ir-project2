Adamson, 83, was killed Sunday as he drove head on into a groupof Somali bandits who had robbed and beat his assistants. Shifta, orroaming bands of Somali tribesmen, are believed responsible for mostof the animal poaching in Kenya.   Adamson and his wife together helped popularize wildlifeconservation. Joy Adamson was killed in 1980 by a young servant in awage dispute.   After hearing gunfire, Adamson and three workers drove about amile from the Kora National Reserve to help the assistants, Directorof Wildlife Richard Leakey said today at a news conference. Leakeywent to Kora to investigate the incident.   Arriving at the scene of the attack, Adamson ignored pleas tostop from other occupants in his car, put his foot on the gas anddrove straight at the bandits, Leakey said. Adamson and two of hisassistants in his car died in the barrage.   ``George was a brave man,'' Leakey said at a news conference.   He said about 150 security personnel had been deployed in theregion since the attack and an area an 80-mile radius from Adamson'scamp had been cordoned off.   ``We intend to find the attackers and bring them to justice,''said Leakey.   He said the government had been increasingly concerned aboutattacks by Shifta since a major anti-poaching effort pushed most ofthem out of Kenya's game reserves.   However, Adamson refused any additional protection and did notwant to be removed from Kora, where he felt well protected by his 16lions and more than half a dozen assistants, Leakey said.   It was due largely to activism by Adamson, who moved to Kora andleased the area from a county council in 1971, that the governmentmade it a game reserve three years later.   As a result of encroachment by nomadic Somali tribesmen and theirherds, Adamson pressured Kenya into calling in paramilitaryanti-poaching troops to drive out the Somalis.   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1983, Adamson saidhe had been told of a plot by Somalis to murder him in the hope thatwith him gone, authorities would be under little pressure to policethe reserve.   ``I think that George always was aware that that was a risk andthat he was treading on somebody's toes,'' said one of Adamson'sclose associates.   Adamson was game warden of Kenya's northern Frontier District in1944 when he married Joy, an Austrian-born artist whose books wouldthrust him into fame.   After living apart from her husband, Joy moved to the gamereserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards.   In 1956, her husband brought home three motherless lion cubs.One, which they named Elsa, became the central character of ``BornFree.'' Adamson served as technical director for a film adaptation.   That book and its sequels, ``Living Free'' and ``Forever Free,''described the Adamsons' unique and controversial practice of takinglions born in captivity and teaching them to survive on their ownbefore freeing them.   The government stopped the practice in 1980 after a maulingincident in Kora in 1980.   Adamson, whose shoulder-length hair and goatee gave him alion-like appearance, kept a modest camp in Kora and lived off apension, interest from a trust fund set up by his wife, anddonations from supporters.   He wrote two books of his own, ``Bwana Game'' and anautobiography ``My Pride and Joy.''   Adamson was born in India in 1906 and first visited Kenya in1924. He later moved to the East African nation and joined its gamedepartment in 1938. He retired as game warden in 1963.   He had no children.</TEXT></DOC>
