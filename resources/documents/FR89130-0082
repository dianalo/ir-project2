The proposed amendments, submitted via the applicationdated March 15, 1988, as modified on December 2, 1988 and supplementedon June 3, 1988 and January 13, 1989, would modify the operations linemanagement senior reactor operator (SRO) license requirements of TechnicalSpecification 6.2.2, ``Unit Staff.''  <ITAG tagnum="84">Need for Environmental Impact Statement  </ITAG>The Commission has found that the proposed amendments will not result inany additional significant environmental impact and has, therefore, determinednot to prepare an environmental impact statement.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment  </ITAG><T3>Identification of the Proposed Amendments  </T3>Currrently, Technical Specification (TS) 6.2.2.g required that the GeneralSupervisor-Nuclear Operations (GS-NO) hold an SRO license. In accordancewith a September 1, 1988 split of the duties of the GS-NO between the GS-NOand the Assistant General Supervisor-Nuclear Operations (AGS-NO), the licenseehas proposed the following changes to TS 6.2.2.g: (1) Modify the requirementthat the GS-NO hold an SRO license to a new requirement that the GS-NOhold or have held an SRO license at Calvert Cliffs, and (2) add a new requirementwhich requires that the AGS-NO hold an SRO license.  <T3>Need for the Proposed Action  </T3>These changes are requested to permit better flexibility in shifting qualifiedpersonnel among management positions while, at the same time, ensuringthat the detailed level of knowledge needed to directly supervise the safeoperation of the plant is maintained.  <T3>Alternatives to the Proposed Action  </T3>Since we have concluded that the environmental effects of the proposedaction are negligible, any alternatives with equal or greater environmentalimpacts need not be evaluated.  The principal alternative would be to deny the requested action. This wouldnot significantly reduce the environmental impacts of plant operation andwould result in reduced operational flexibility.  <T3>Alternative Use of Resources  </T3>This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredby the Commission in the ``Final Environmental Statement Relating to Operationof Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2'' dated April 1973. <T3>Environmental Impact of the Proposed Amendments  </T3>These proposed changes are basically administrative in nature and are providedto facilitate the splitting of the GS-NO's roles between the GS-NO andAGS-NO.  Consequently, these proposed changes pose neither radiological nor non-radiologicalimpacts upon the environment. The day-to-day operation of the plant shallcontinue to be directly supervised by a manager who holds an SRO license.This constitutes no change in the level of safety exercised in plant operations.Furthermore, the Plant Operations and Safety Review Committee shall continueto include a member with an SRO license which ensures that all nuclearsafety matters will continue to be reviewed by a member who has a currentdetailed level of knowledge of plant operation.  Therefore, the Commission has determined that these proposed amendmentspose no significant environmental impact.  <T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted  </T3>None.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact  </ITAG>Based on the aforementioned environmental assessment, the Commission hasdetermined that the proposed amendments will not have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment.  For further details with respect to his action see: (1) The applicationsfor license amendments dated March 15, 1988 and December 2, 1988, and (2)the licensee's supplemental letters dated June 3, 1988 and January 13,1989.
