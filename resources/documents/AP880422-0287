Stevens andamp; Co. late Thursday rejected a$1.22 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose buyoutproposal included splitting the textile giant's assets among them.   Sources said a special committee of outside directors onStevens' board informed fabric maker West Point-Pepperell Inc. andthe investment firm Odyssey Partners that their joint$68.50-a-share bid was unacceptable.   The directors' objections focused on the length of time thegroup's offer would be extended as well as whether Odyssey wouldhave been able to get financing to purchase its share of assets,which sources said were valued at about $530 million.   Because the offer was conditioned upon Odyssey's purchase ofassets, ``that raised the uncertainty'' that disturbed the board,said one source close to the transaction.   Sources also said that under the proposal, West Point could haveextended its offer beyond the 10 business days' extension requiredby Securities and Exchange Commission rules.   The board committee asked that the conditions be eliminated,according to one source who added, ``now the ball's in theircourt.''   Among the assets Odyssey would purchase were Stevens' ``greigegoods,'' or unfinished textile operations. The division sells about$235 million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn.   Odyssey's outstanding a $68.50-a-share tender offer, which hasbeen recommended by the Stevens board, is set to expire at midnightEDT Tuesday, the same day Pepperell's competing $67-a-share tenderoffer is set to expire.   The two companies, which had bid against each other three timesin a heated auction, announced earlier in the week that they werenegotiating about making a joint bid for Stevens for $68.50 a sharein cash.   Separately, the attorneys general of New York and the Carolinasagreed to issue subpoenas Thursday to Pepperell, Odyssey and BibbCo., which has signed an agreement with Pepperell to purchasecertain Stevens assets.   South Carolina Attorney General Travis Medlock said he wasconcerned the three companies, in combining their efforts toacquire Stevens, may have engaged in ``bid-rigging,'' a violationof antitrust laws, in determining what price to pay for Stevensstock.   A spokesman for Pepperell said today that the company has ``notbeen accused of any (antitrust) violations, and we are confidenteverything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws.''   The West Point, Ga., textile company is making its bid forStevens in conjunction with NTC Group, the parent of textilemanufacturer Bibb.   Pepperell has received Federal Trade Commission permission tosell half of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet linesto NTC Group for about $170 million.   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyoutoffer earlier this year from a group led by its own seniormanagement, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth-generationmember of the family that founded the company in 1813.   Pepperell launched a $62.50-a-share tender offer last monthafter Stevens agreed to a buyout by Odyssey at $61.50 a share.Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $64.   Pepperell increased its tender offer to $67 a share, but Odysseytopped that by $1.50 a share just hours later.</TEXT></DOC>
