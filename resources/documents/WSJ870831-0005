The repeatedly delayed test was completed without a hitch yesterday afternoon watched by officials of the company, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other spectators. The 126-foot booster rocket, attached to a horizontal test stand in a mountain valley here, shot plumes of smoke thousands of feet into the air during the spectacular two-minute firing.    With no immediate sign that any part of the rocket had failed -- including the crucial new joints that connect sections of the motor's casing -- company officials were quick to proclaim the test a success. Its impact, was damped, however, by the three aborted countdowns that kept the test from occurring on schedule last week.    Company officials added that it would be several weeks before they could fully analyze the test's results. However, all initial inspections of the boosters indicated that the new joints and other modified parts of the rocket operated as expected.    When the firing was canceled last Thursday, shuttle program officials rescheduled the test for Saturday. But in a determined effort to avoid repeated embarrassment, they pushed back the test still another day as engineers thoroughly rechecked all systems. The company made two dry test runs on Saturday.    With the test completed yesterday, U.E. Garrison, president of Morton Thiokol's aerospace division, commented with relief: &quot;It was the longest two minutes I've ever been through.&quot;    The test was the first full-scale firing of the new booster rocket-redesigned following the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986, which killed seven astronauts. A presidential commission concluded in June last year that a faulty joint in the booster allowed hot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's huge external fuel tank.    The events surrounding the test, however, indicated some of the difficulties the space shuttle program may have in restoring public confidence. Before last week's initial attempt at the firing, officials of Morton Thiokol and NASA had hoped to put on a display that would give an immediate boost to the program.    In the barren mountain valley where the company normally conducts rocket tests in obscurity, it set up facilities so that a large crowd could watch the test of the new booster, in addition to television crews. A number of dignitaries were invited and satellite links were established with audiences of space officials and Morton Thiokol employees in Houston, Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Huntsville, Ala.    But when repeated problems with the company's test equipment kept forcing postponements of the firing, the major promotional effort turned into a potential public-relations liability.    Despite the difficulties of blending science and public relations, Morton Thiokol officials said it is something they know they must learn to live with. &quot;I'd rather go off and do (the test) by myself,&quot; said John Thirkill, vice president and general manager of the company's space operations. &quot;But we have accepted the fact that we will be watched.&quot;    Referring to the delay in the test-firing, Boyd Brinton, manager of the space booster project for Morton Thiokol, added: &quot;It was disappointing and embarrassing to have it happen with so many people watching, but we didn't panic and we didn't do anything dumb.&quot;    In the days following the aborted tests, Morton Thiokol officials sought to deflect criticism by arguing that the delays only underscored the company's renewed caution toward the shuttle program -- noting that it had been criticized in the past for trying to move too quickly.    &quot;The public needs to cut us some slack,&quot; said one Morton Thiokol official.    Despite the apparent success of the initial firing, there was a problem with the same test equipment that forced cancellation of one of last week's countdowns.    Test officials said that a so-called water-deluge system -- designed to cool the rocket after the test-firing -- failed to operate properly, causing some damage to the rocket motor. In flight, the rocket boosters separate from the shuttle and plunge into the sea. </TEXT></DOC>
