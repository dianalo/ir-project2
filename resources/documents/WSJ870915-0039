In the 1986 third quarter, Management Science reported net income of $260,000, or one cent a share, on revenue of $38.8 million. The per-share charge for the current quarter will be in the range of $2.90 to $3.00 a share, the computer software firm said. The accounting change will also create an additional backlog of unrecognized revenue as of last Dec. 31 in the range of $110 million to $115 million, the company added.    Retroactive to Jan. 1, the company said it will recognize license fees upon delivery of software to customers instead of recognizing a substantial portion of a license fee upon execution of a contract, as it now does. The company also said it will recognize support agreement fees on a pro-rata basis over the life of a support agreement instead of taking recognition upon receipt of payment.    Management Science said the accounting policy change was recommended by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in its recent software revenue recognition paper.    The company also said it will restate results for the first half of 1987 to show net income in the range of $5 million to $7 million, or 27 cents to 38 cents a share, on revenue in the range of $130 million to $135 million. The company had posted a $1 million net loss for the first half on revenue of $106.7 million.    The accounting policy changes will cause quarterly results to be more predictable and less seasonal, Management Science said. </TEXT></DOC>
