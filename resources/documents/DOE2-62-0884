This paper studies the long term competitivenessof introducing the renewable energy sources alongside the conventionalgenerating units in a generation expansion plan by linking between ashort term study and a long term planning model. In the short term study,there is a chance to study extensively the different combinations ofthe renewable energy sources which can operate with the conventionalgenerating system at different objectives. These objectives are variedbetween two general strategies; the fuel saver strategy and the peakshaving strategy. In the long term planning, these combinations are consideredas decision variables beside the conventional resources. For this purpose,a long term generation expansion planning model is used to decide whichstrategy can be used and the capacity as well as the time of addition.This model is based on the decision tree concept which has enough flexibilityand is capable to model the uncertainties inherent in the problem.</TEXT></DOC>
