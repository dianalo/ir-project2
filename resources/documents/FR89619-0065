DPR-32 and DPR-37,issued to Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operationof the Surry Power Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Surry County, Virginia.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendments would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications(TS) by: (1) Raising the minimum requirement high level intake canal waterlevel from 18 feet to 23 feet, (2) increasing the requirement from twoto three emergency service water pumps to be operable with provisions forlimited duration outages, and (3) providing operability and surveillancerequirements for the new safety-related high level intake canal level actuationsystem.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated March 27, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed changes to the TS are required to maintain a higher waterlevel in the intake canal to ensure adequate flow through the componentcooling water (CCW) system and other safety-related heat exchangers duringaccident conditions.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe TS. The proposed revisions would require the licensee to raise thewater level in the intake canal from 18 to 23 feet; require three emergencyservice water pumps to be operable; and cause isolation of the main condenserand certain service water isolation valves upon receipt of a signal fromthe safety-related canal low level actuation system. The proposed revisionswill also require operability and surveillance requirements for the newsafety-related canal water level actuation system. The proposed changesdo not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changesare being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmentalimpact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changesto the TS involve systems which are not located within the restricted areaas defined in 10 CFR Part 20. These changes do not affect non-radiologicalplant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, theCommission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 10, 1989 (54 FR 14303). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statements for the Surry Power Station, Units1 and 2.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendments.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendments dated March 27, 1989, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC and at the Swem Library, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg,Virginia 23185.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 12th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan A.
