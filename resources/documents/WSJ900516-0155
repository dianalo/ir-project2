Your April 9 &quot;After Poindexter&quot; editorial is builton a mighty thin reed. Blaming Congress and the Democrats for&quot;criminalizing of policy differences with the executivebranch&quot; begs a much larger issue here: Should members of theexecutive branch be allowed to withhold vital informationfrom those members of Congress charged by law to monitorspecific actions of the president?   A lifelong Republican, Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh,didn't think so. An impartial grand jury that voted to indictAdm. John Poindexter didn't think so, nor did the 12 jurorswho found him guilty on all five charges.</LP><TEXT>   Your Iran-Contra editorials send the wrong message both tothose who believe they can hide behind so-called patrioticacts without punishment, and also to those who cynically viewsuch selective &quot;law-and-order&quot; posturing as further evidencethat there indeed exist two standards of justice in ourcountry.
