In the 1950s, studiesof Japanese atomic-bomb survivors revealed that at 4-17 wk of gestation,the greater the dose, the smaller the brain (and head size), and thatbeginning at 0.5 Gy (50 rad) in Hiroshima, mental retardation increasedin frequency with increasing dose. No other excess of birth defects wasobserved. Otake and Schull (1984) pointed out that the period of susceptibilityto mental retardation coincided with that for proliferation and migrationof neuronal elements from near the cerebral ventricles to the cortex.Mental retardation could be the result of interference with this process.Their analysis indicated that exposures at 8-15 wk to 0.01-0.02 Gy (1-2rad) doubled the frequency of severe mental retardation. This estimatewas based on small numbers of mentally retarded atomic-bomb survivors.Although nuclear accidents have occurred recently, new cases will hopefullybe too rare to provide further information about the risk of mental retardation.It may be possible, however, to learn about lesser impairment. New psychometrictests may be helpful in detecting subtle deficits in intelligence orneurodevelopmental function. One such test is PEERAMID, which is beingused in schools to identify learning disabilities due, for example, todeficits in attention, short- or long-term memory, or in sequencing information.This and other tests could be applied in evaluating survivors of intrauterineexposure to various doses of ionizing radiation. The results could changeour understanding of the safety of low-dose exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
