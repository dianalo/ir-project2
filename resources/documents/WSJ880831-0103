With ministerial approval, foreign ownership in radio stations could be as high as 25%.    The changes are part of a deregulation of New Zealand's broadcasting system. Both state and privately owned radio networks operate in New Zealand, along with two state-owned television channels. A private television channel, TV3, is preparing to begin broadcasts. </TEXT></DOC>
