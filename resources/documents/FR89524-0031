The Secretary proposes to change the title of the program from the Secretary'sDiscretionary Program for Mathematics, Science, Computer Learning, andCritical Foreign Languages to the National Program for Mathematics andScience Education to reflect the revised statute. Because projects in computer learning and critical foreign languages areno longer authorized by the program statute, the Secretary proposes toeliminate all references to these types of projects in the regulations.The Secretary proposed to add to andSection; 755.12 several priorities establishedby the Act. These priorities are for projects to train and retrain teachersin methods of scientific inquiry, and to build upon and add to projectsthat are already developed and disseminated. The Secretary proposes to amend the definition of magnet school programsfor gifted and talented children currently in the regulations at andSection;755.13(a)(1) to include a school or education center that offers a specialcurriculum to which students are not automatically assigned but may seekto attend on a voluntary basis because of the special curriculum. As required by the Act, the Secretary proposes to amend the priority forprojects serving historically underrepresented and underserved populationsin the fields of mathematics and science at andSection; 744.13(a)(2) of thecurrent regulations and andSection; 755.12(a)(1) of these proposed regulationsto include specifically gifted and telented children from these populations.The Secretary proposes to amend the definition of historically underservedand underrepresented populations to include economically disadvantagedpersons in order to be consistent with the language in the statute forthe Mathematics and Science Education Program (State grants). The Secretary proposes to amend the selection criteria concerning the planof operation and the quality of key personnel to include specific referencesto the selection of project participants and personnel without regard torace, color, national origin, gender, age, handicapping condition.In order to emphasize more clearly the impact, outcomes and transferabilityof project results, the Secretary proposes to modify and synthesize languagepertaining to the national significance criterion.  The Department published proposed regulations implementing the amendedPart E of the General Education Provision Act on December 2, 1988 at 53FR 48866, and those regulations, when final, will apply to this program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291  </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meetthe criteria for major regulations established in the order.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulationsare small LEAs and small private non-profit organizations receiving Federalfunds under this program. However, the regulations would not have a significanteconomic impact on the small LEAs and organizations affected because theregulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessaryFederal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirementsto ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  </ITAG>Sections 755.20 and 755.32 contain information collection requirements.As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Educationwill submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budgetfor its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))  Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the informationcollection requirements should direct them to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,DC 20503; Attention: James D. Houser.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review  </ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.  In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation to Comment  </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regardingthese proposed regulations.  All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will beavailable for public inspection, during and after the comment period, inRoom 522, 555 New Jersey Avenue NW., Washington, DC, between the hoursof 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federalholidays.  To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements ofExecutive Order 12291 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and theiroverall requirement of reducing regulatory burden, the Secretary invitescomment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any regulatoryburdens found in these proposed regulations.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact  </ITAG>The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulationsin this document would require transmission of information that is beinggathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the UnitedStates.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 755  </ITAG>Historically underserved and underrepresented populations, Gifted and talentedstudends, Grant programs_Education, Instruction, Mathematics, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Science.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 8, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
