(products).andO;Product:   PageBuilder 2.0 (Desktop publishing software ).andO;Topic:     Desktop PublishingSoftware PackagesEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CSI Publishing Inc.andM;PAGEBUILDER 2.0andM;PageBuilder offers a mixed bag of features.andP;  Though it has some capabilitiesthat all the other products lack, it also has some serious shortcomings.andM;It can import AutoCAD's vector-graphics files and .DIF files to producecommon business graphs, but its other text- and graphics-import options arelimited: It can read only ASCII text, and the only other graphics-importformat is .PCX.andM;Similarly, though PageBuilder can print in color on such color printers asthe CalComp ColorMaster and the HP PaintJet, it does not truly supportPostScript printers.andP;  Users can print on PostScript printers, but only bysending a bit-mapped graphic image; it cannot use the fonts built into suchprinters.andM;It does, however, support the LaserJet family and a reasonable range ofdot-matrix printers.andM;PageBuilder was also the hardest package to learn.andP;  A call to CSI'scustomer-support service was necessary to complete the newsletter.andM;Much of the product's difficulty stems from how it handles text.andP;  Users mustfirst edit text with the built-in editor, then lay out the text, along withany accompanying graphics, with a different, what-you-see-is-what-you-get(WYSIWYG) part of the program.andM;PageBuilder's GUI also made it difficult to use.andP;  It has no icons, and somecommands are available only through function keys.andP;  A context-sensitive,on-line Help facility does provide a listing of the command choices that arevalid at any given time.andP;  This is useful, but not quite enough.andM;Likewise, the documentation did not offer much help.andP;  Its poor organizationmade topics difficult to find despite its fairly short, 130-page length.andO;There was also very little tutorial information.andM;CSI Publishing Inc. of Chino Hills, Calif., can be reached at (800) 842-2486or (714) 628-7873.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;Despite our reviewers' findings, some PageBuilder users found the package tobe sufficient for their needs.andM;&quot;PageBuilder's tools for layout are very intuitive; you can make changesrapidly and realistically,&quot; said Bill Webb, president of William Webb Inc., amanagement-consulting firm in Phoenix, Ariz.andM;&quot;The thing I like the most about PageBuilder, in contrast to the AldusPageMaker program, is that it's a real time-saver,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;My typicalpage has 12 to 15 typeface changes, and all the data prints in 45 seconds.&quot;andM;Webb said in the next upgrade he would like to see better-proportionedtypefaces.andM;He was impressed with the high-resolution graphics the software produces,especially its chart capabilities.andP;  &quot;It produces all the bar and pie charts Ineed, and it's easy to manipulate them once created,&quot; he said.andM;Gayle Woods, president of the Label Factory Ltd., a label maker located inSanta Ana, Calif., said he chose PageBuilder because it was simpler to usethan Aldus Corp.'s PageMaker.andM;Woods uses the software to create labels for businesses by first scanning andreducing logos and then adding text.andM;Woods said the product's interface is speedy, but that in CSI's next upgradehe would like the ability to place type in an arc, along with better scanningand editing capabilities.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
