Since 1985, Mr. Smilow has helped arrange four -- yes,four -- successive leveraged buy-outs of Playtex Inc.'sbusinesses. Each time the company changed hands, its chiefexecutive officer scooped up personal profits, ranging from$16 million to $73.7 million. All told, he is $186.5 millionricher, though he initially risked just $5.5 million of hisown money.                                                                                                          But after all the deals, the brassiere and tampon companyis back about where it started. Before the buy-outs, Playtexwas part of a food and consumer-products conglomerate,Chicago-based Beatrice Cos. Now, five years later, thePlaytex operations are moving into the hands of anotherChicago food and consumer-products conglomerate, Sara LeeCorp.   Mr. Smilow's windfalls mark him as yet anotherentrepreneur enriched by the 1980s LBO boom. But Playtexitself hasn't been so fortunate, and its fate raises aquestion whether anyone else -- Playtex employees, customersor the U.S. economy -- gained much from Mr. Smilow'smaneuvers.   &quot;You haven't accomplished a tremendous amount&quot; byshuttling Playtex from owner to owner, says Mitch Bartlett, aMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. analyst. By some measures, in fact,Playtex lost ground. Its market share in both bras andtampons has eroded since 1985. Product development has beencut back.   Playtex has shown gains in operating profit over the pastfive years, but they reflect price increases andcost-cutting, which may have damaged its long-term marketposition. Now, the austerity is likely to be reversed by SaraLee, which plans to pump money back into cash-hungry areassuch as marketing, capital spending and headquartersstaffing.   Mr. Smilow defends his record at Playtex. &quot;We were able toreduce overhead,&quot; he says. &quot;We asked people to work smarter,not longer. It became popular not to spend, instead of itbeing popular to have the biggest budget, the most peoplereporting to you, the largest office.&quot;   The new investors in Playtex businesses aren't so upbeat.Playtex &quot;is an extremely good brand {in the bra business},but it may have suffered in its development by being in aleveraged position,&quot; says Sara Lee's chairman, John Bryan.During the buy-outs, he adds, &quot;I would guess that Playtex'smanagers didn't have the long-term orientation that theymight have.&quot;   In the end, the biggest result of such LBO odysseys may besimply to make a few people very rich -- especially, inPlaytex's case, Mr. Smilow, a 58-year-old marketingspecialist.   Until 1984, Mr. Smilow was a classic big-company manager,running the Playtex division of Esmark Inc. and owning about$3 million of Esmark stock, less than 0.2% of the sharesoutstanding. Shrewd and sharp-tongued, Mr. Smilow was citedby Fortune magazine in 1984 as one of America's toughestbosses. His favorite put-down of slow-thinking subordinates:&quot;Stupid is forever.&quot;   Then came a flurry of takeovers and buy-outs. First, Mr.Smilow found his own job in jeopardy after Beatrice acquiredEsmark in mid-1984. His new boss, Beatrice Chief ExecutiveJames Dutt, bombarded Playtex with a stream of directivesthat, Mr. Smilow later said, &quot;was like being nibbled to deathby a duck.&quot; In August 1984, Mr. Smilow quit Beatrice andPlaytex, announcing a desire to pursue a leveraged buy-out onhis own.   He didn't take long to win in the takeover game. In late1985, his former Esmark boss, Donald Kelly, joined with LBOfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in a $6.2 billionleveraged bid for Beatrice. Mr. Smilow became part of theKKR/Kelly team, putting up $500,000 in return for Beatricestock and options equal to 1% of the company -- a stakeultimately worth $16.5 million.   Within weeks of KKR's acquiring Beatrice in April 1986,Playtex was put up for sale. Several big U.S. companies bidfor it; so did Mr. Smilow, in a leveraged buy-out proposallargely financed with the help of Drexel Burnham LambertInc., the big underwriter of high-yield bonds. In August1986, the Smilow/Drexel team was the winner, acquiringPlaytex and Beatrice's Max Factor cosmetics for $1.25billion.   &quot;It's like Dorothy finally reaching Oz,&quot; Mr. Smilow saidwhen he became the new owner/manager of Playtex. Thanks toDrexel's then-awesome ability to sell junk bonds, Playtex'snew owners borrowed nearly all the money needed for the LBO.Mr. Smilow paid just $5 million for a 14.3% stake in Playtex.   Back in charge of Playtex, Mr. Smilow got tougher thanever. He and Vice Chairman Hercules Sotos slashed the staffat Playtex's Stamford, Conn., headquarters to 170 people from220. They axed bureaucratic remnants of the Beatrice days,such as elaborate five-year plans, thus reducing thebudgeting and accounting staff.   In the bra business, Playtex raised profit margins bymoving most of its manufacturing to the Philippines fromPuerto Rico. That cost hundreds of Puerto Ricans their jobsbut cut Playtex's labor bill 60% or more.   In the tampon business, Playtex raised prices as much as10% a year, double the U.S. inflation rate in the late 1980s.A few customers abandoned Playtex for other brands, but moststayed.   Playtex's main competitor, Tambrands Inc., was thendistracted by its own management turmoil and didn't fullyrespond to Playtex's moves. &quot;They've raised prices fasterthan us and been extremely good at it,&quot; says Paul Konney,Tambrands senior vice president for marketing.   Immediately after the buy-out, Mr. Smilow also decreedthat Playtex stop launching new products. He allowedextensions of existing lines but ruled out efforts -- onceencouraged -- to diversify into products such as hand lotion.&quot;We had been very unsuccessful,&quot; he says.   Aided by the savings, Playtex's profit before interest andtaxes soared to $132 million in 1987 from $65 million in1985. The company quickly trimmed the buy-out debt, too,chiefly by selling the Max Factor business to Revlon Inc. for$345 million. That cast off a promising subsidiary, but itpared Playtex's long-term debt to about $650 million frommore than $1 billion.   &quot;Clearly there was an element of management thinkingdifferently once it had a big ownership in the company,&quot; saysDean Kehler, an investment banker who frequently advisedPlaytex in the 1980s. &quot;Top executives did an excellent job offocusing the company's attention on profitability.&quot;   In mid-1988, Mr. Smilow decided to borrow even more moneyagainst the Playtex businesses, enabling him to collect someprofits from his 1986 ownership stake and at the same timeraise his equity stake in the ongoing operations. He splitPlaytex in half and then sold both companies to new buyers --chiefly himself -- in what amounted to third-round buy-outs.   The new LBOs were facilitated by the frenzied junk-bondmarket; investors lent more money to the Playtex operationseven though the prospectuses for both the bra and tamponbusinesses warned that &quot;Playtex's leverage poses significantrisks to holders of the notes.&quot; In fact, the two halves ofPlaytex were left with $1.28 billion of debt, nearly twice asmuch as before. The debt-service payments were just barelysupported by the businesses' 1988 operating profit of about$144 million.   But for Mr. Smilow, the two 1988 transactions were highlyprofitable. He collected $71.8 million for the $5 million hehad invested in the 1986 buy-out. And he emerged with a 57.7%stake in Playtex Apparel Inc., the new bra company, and a28.1% stake in Playtex Family Products Corp., the tamponmaker. The two stakes cost him a total of about $30 million;he had managed to extract $43 million from Playtex whileincreasing his holding.   From late 1988 on, Mr. Smilow continued trying to squeezegreater profits from both halves of Playtex. Whenever amanager left, Mr. Smilow decreed that the job be left vacantfor several months, to see whether the company could get by.Very often, the answer was yes.   &quot;Joel is very careful to analyze all expenses,&quot; saysThomas Lee, a Boston LBO specialist who took a stake inPlaytex Family Products. &quot;His management team is well-suitedto operating in a leveraged environment.&quot;   But further financial gains were hard to come by. In thetampon business, rival Tambrands began competing harder,raising its market share to 54.1% in this year's thirdquarter from 52.2% in 1988, according to Diana Temple, aSalomon Brothers Inc. analyst. Playtex tampons, meanwhile,lost about three percentage points of market share, slippingto 28.2%.   &quot;They've been managing Playtex for profit, not marketshare,&quot; Ms. Temple concludes. Playtex Family Products didpush up profit margins slightly in 1990 and 1991, but muchmore slowly than before.   In the bra business, profit margins declined in 1990, asPlaytex Apparel relied more on sales of its lower-pricedGitano and Cacherel brands. Market share in U.S. departmentstores slipped steadily, to less than 11% of industry salesin 1989 and 1990 from more than 16% in 1985. Those marketshare figures are &quot;irrelevant,&quot; Mr. Smilow contends,explaining that much of Playtex's sales are outsidedepartment stores. Most competitors, however, regarddepartment-store sales as an important gauge.   Playtex Apparel did better in Western Europe in 1989 and1990. But with big debt bills, it lacked the cash tocapitalize on the new opportunities in Eastern Europe.   By last summer, Mr. Smilow wanted to sell the brabusiness. Playtex Apparel, still burdened with heavy debt,earned just $3 million for the 1991 first half, as $26.2million in interest payments consumed most of its $32.1million of operating profits.   The first suitor, a Wall Street buy-out group, refused tomeet Mr. Smilow's asking price. When those talks fellthrough, he phoned a long-ago bidder for the Playtexbusinesses, Sara Lee's Mr. Bryan, on July 10 and asked himwhether he wanted to bid. The same day, Mr. Bryan said yes.   On Aug. 8, Sara Lee announced an agreement to buy PlaytexApparel for $171 million, plus assumption of debt. Bycombining Playtex with Sara Lee's Bali and Haynes for Herbrands, Sara Lee became the largest bra maker in the U.S. andcould achieve economies of scale. &quot;This was the best move wecould make to build a major position,&quot; Mr. Bryan says. SaraLee also will be able to refinance Playtex Apparel's debt atlower interest rates.   And Mr. Smilow made another killing. When Sara Leecompleted the purchase last month, his 57.7% stake in PlaytexApparel brought in $98.7 million -- some $75 million morethan he paid for it.   On Nov. 5, Sara Lee announced plans to pay $62.5 millionfor a stake in the other half of Playtex: Playtex FamilyProducts. That price covered a 25% equity stake, variouslicensing arrangements and an option to buy the rest of thetampon company by 1996 and reunite the two halves of Playtex.The deal values all of Playtex Family Products at $125million, not including the unit's debt. That makes Mr.Smilow's remaining 28% stake in Playtex's tampon businessworth $35 million -- $30 million more than he paid for it.   Sara Lee officials say they see lots of opportunities torevive and expand the Playtex businesses after the years ofausterity. Mr. Bryan talked this month about seeking&quot;increased use of the Playtex brand name internationally&quot; and&quot;an opportunity to expand our household and personal-carepositions.&quot;   That strategy seems sound, Mr. Smilow says. He suggeststhat the bra company start trying to sell in Poland and thatthe tampon business put an extra $10 million in its U.S.marketing budget. &quot;Those aren't things an LBO can afford toengage in,&quot; he says. &quot;In an LBO, cash flow is everything. Asa rich public company, you can elect to do more.&quot;   As Playtex comes into Sara Lee's hands, the circularity inPlaytex's saga is remarkable. Sara Lee's annual sales ofabout $12 billion make it almost the same size as Beatricewas when it owned Playtex. Both Sara Lee and the old Beatriceare based in Chicago. And Sara Lee's controller, WilliamCarmichael, is an old Beatrice hand.   More than 100 Playtex executives will collect profits fromowning stock or options in the two closely held companies;some 22 of them stand to gain $1 million or more. The biggestwinner by far is Mr. Smilow, who says he probably will retireand spend his money on something &quot;fun,&quot; such as an athleticteam or media property. Already, he has bought an $8.5million home in Westport, Conn., and has endowed the footballcoach's job at Yale University, his alma mater, with $1million.   Playtex traveled full circle from one Chicago conglomerateto another, but that's just the way buy-outs work, Mr. Smilowsays. &quot;You have to recognize buy-outs were bred to be sold.They come into being with an obvious plan that they be sold,either to another company or the public. I don't know of anythat stay forever in an LBO status.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
