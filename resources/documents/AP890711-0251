Hog futures also retreated while cattle futures rose.   On other markets, grains and soybeans were sharply lower; energyfutures advanced and precious metals were mixed.   Frozen pork bellies settled .43 cent to 1.80 cents lower with thecontract for delivery this month at 28.97 cents a pound, matchingthe nine-year low reached May 31.   The trading reflected expectations that a weekly exchange reportwould show no significant decline in the amount of pork bellies incold storage outside of Chicago.   The report, issued after the close, showed an unexpectedly largedrawdown of 4.6 million pounds, which analysts said could promptsome buying of futures on Wednesday.   But frozen stocks of bellies, which are cured and sliced to makebacon, still are believed to be at near-record levels as the end ofthe heaviest usage period approaches.   Charles Levitt, chief livestock market analyst for ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc., said he expects the Agriculture Department'sJuly 21 cold-storage report to show about 128 million pounds offrozen bellies on hand as of July 1, which would be thesecond-highest total on record for that date and 1{ times the10-year average.   The July 1 record high was 133.2 million pounds in 1964.   Levitt said traders fear there will be little significantdrawdown in frozen stocks by fall, when hog slaughters typicallyincrease and fresh bellies grow more abundant.   ``This is the time of year we're supposed to be taking the chunkof bellies out of storage and using them in consumer channels,''Levitt said.   ``If you get into the fall and start the seasonal increase inslaughters again, what are you going to do if you've got a lot ofbellies still left in storage? They'll be worthless or nearworthless.''   Hog futures prices fell in spillover selling from the belly pit,while cattle futures advanced on expectations for dwindling suppliesthis fall.   Live cattle were unchanged to .65 cent higher with August at70.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent higherwith August at 81.47 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent to 1 centlower with July at 46.87 cents a pound.   Corn and soybean futures fell sharply for the second straight dayon the Chicago Board of Trade as showers relieved crop-witheringheat and dryness in the Midwest. Wheat and oat futures also declined.   Analysts said a morning downpour in downtown Chicago may havesteepened the sell-off, which was linked initially to Monday'sNational Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook calling for normalrainfall and sub-normal temperatures in the Corn Belt from Sundaythrough July 20.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7} cents lower with July at $3.91} abushel; corn was { cent to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.59 abushel; oats were 2{ cents to 2} cents lower with July at $1.44\ abushel; soybeans were 17} cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at$7.26 a bushel.   Oil futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange,partly recovering from losses in the previous session.
