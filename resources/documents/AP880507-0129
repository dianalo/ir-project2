Nine Arabs were injured Saturday by beatings and rubber bulletsin sporadic clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.   The army said it had no reports about beatings but that it waschecking reports about the clashes.   On Friday, the government ordered 44-year-old Mubarak Awaddeported, alleging he had done much to incite the five-monthuprising in the occupied territories.   So far, 184 Palestinians and two Israelis have died in theviolence that began Dec. 8, according to U.N. figures.   Awad protested the order and announced Saturday that he had beenon hunger strike since he was jailed Thursday night and that heplanned to continue the action ``until the (deportation) order isrescinded,'' said his wife, Nancy Nye.   Ms. Nye also told The Associated Press that prison officialstook away her husband's mattress and blanket Saturday ``aspunishment for refusing to eat.''   The Jerusalem-born Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta,Ohio, has urged civil disobedience against Israeli rule as head ofthe Jerusalem-based Center for Non-Violent Studies.   Some of the methods he has advocated such as sit-ins, commercialstrikes and a boycott of Israeli goods, have been adopted by PLOunderground leaders of the uprising.   The United States urged Israel on Friday to reconsider thedeportation.   Many West Bank Arabs also have stopped paying some of theirtaxes. Israel television reported Saturday that the governmentwarned Arab leaders it would cut off water and electricity to 10West Bank villages unless residents paid what they owed.   Meanwhile, the religious underground movement, ``Hamas,'' anArabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, issued apage-long leaflet calling for more anti-Israel protests.   Referring to Israel the leaflet said ``the Zionist entity andcollaborators and enemies of the nation try to silence the voice ofthe intefadeh (Arabic for uprising).''   ``We will continue our blessed intefadeh with all our strengthand determination ... Forward on the road of dignity and victory,more sacrifices, more attacks on the enemy, the enemy of thenation.''   The leaflet was printed Friday and distributed at morningprayers Saturday. It urged Palestinians to step up anti-Israeliprotests during the last 10 days of the Islamic holy month ofRamadan, which is marked by daytime fasts and feasts at night.   The leaflet also urged special prayers and observance in memoryof Palestinians killed in the rebellion.   Israel has heightened pressure to break the rebellion in thelast week by detaining Arab journalists and ordering shopsthroughout the West Bank shut for three days until Sunday.   The latest Israeli move came Friday when the government orderedAwad deported.   Also Saturday, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters whoblocked a main road with boulders in Anabta in the West Bank, saidan Arab reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Hospital officials said a 25-year-old woman was treated afterbeing hit by four rubber bullets.   Eight Arabs, including three women, were also treated at ShifaHospital in Gaza City for bruises and lacerations after beingbeaten by soldiers during disturbances at the Beach refugee campand in Gaza, said hospital director Dr. Ahmed Yassih.   The army said it had no reports about beatings or any violentincidents in Gaza.</TEXT></DOC>
