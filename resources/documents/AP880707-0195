The fatal accident, which caused a jump in world oil pricesThursday, prompted the government's Department of Energy topostpone the process for granting new off-shore licenses, whichwould open up more areas for exploration. The department had beenscheduled to announce on Thursday the blocks for which it wasinviting bids for the licenses.   ``Because of what happened, we've decided to postpone that atthe moment,'' said a department spokesman, who spoke anonymously inkeeping with British practice.   The price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded internationalcrude oil, jumped on Thursday to $15.05 a barrel for Septemberdelivery, up 32 cents from late Wednesday.   Occidental Petroleum Co., owner of the Piper Alpha rig, said agas leak apparently was to blame for the disaster.   The rig produced 167,200 barrels a day, the company said. Abarrel contains 42 gallons.   In addition to the Piper oil field, five other fields were shutdown, the department said. They were the Claymore, Tartan,Highland, Scapa and Petronella fields, it said.   That meant production was cut by a total of about 220,000barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day, or about one-tenth of theBritish sector's production, the department and analysts said.   ``There's pressure on the immediate availability for North Seacrude,'' said Philip Morgan, an oil analyst with the Londoninvestment firm Warburg Securities.   Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst with the London investment firmBarclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., added, however: ``That's going to befairly short-term.''   The related fields should be back in production in a week, andPiper Alpha probably will be out of production for up to a year,Ms. Mullins said.   Morgan said the industry already was experiencing a shortagebecause of regular maintenance, which oil companies generally do inthe summmer when the weather is milder.   North Sea oil production in the British sector averages 2{million barrels a day, the Department of Energy says. Production isdown 400,000 barrels a day from that level because of themaintenance, Morgan said.   Producers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,of which Britain is not a member, will step in to meet demand, Ms.Mullins said.   The oil price also has been boosted by favorable statisticsreleased this week, Morgan said.   ``There is starting to be a perception that the glut in worldsupplies in general is not as bad as people thought,'' Morgan said.   Occidental Petroleum's production won't be severely affected bythe fire, because it has other outlets, Ms. Mullins said.   There were concerns about claims against the company, however,and Occidental Petroleum's stock fell 50 cents to $26.25 in earlytrading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock price of BritishPetroleum Co. PLC, the biggest producer in the British sector, fell3 cents to $4.49 in afternoon trading on London's Stock Exchange.   The disaster could prove expensive for the North Sea oilproducers in general, Morgan said.   ``Obviously, questions are going to be raised about safety whichmight involve companies in a lot more expenditure,'' Morgan said.   The British sector of the North Sea oil fields runs from theShetland Islands north of Scotland down to East Anglia on England'ssoutheast coast, covering hundreds of thousands of square miles.The first British sector gas fields were discovered in 1964 and oilproduction began in 1975, the Department of Energy said.   The sector employed 28,000 people in offshore facilities at theend of last year, it said.   There are 123 fixed installations, including the Piper Alphaplatform, in the British sector, with 40 mobile rigs, thedepartment said.</TEXT></DOC>
