(Porsche) for an exemption from the parts marking requirementsof the vehicle theft prevention standard for the Porsche 928 and 911 carlinesfor Model Year 1990. The agency takes this action under section 605 ofthe Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. The agency has determinedthat the antitheft device which the petitioner intends to install on theselines as standard equipment is likely to be as effective in reducing anddeterming motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts markingrequirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>The exemption granted by this petition will become effectivebeginning with the 1990 Model Year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On January 27, 1989, this agency receivedfrom Porsche a petition for exemption from the theft prevention standardfor the Model Year (MY) 1990 Porsche 928 and 911 carlines pursuant to 49CFR 543, <T3>Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard.</T3> The agency reviewedthe January 27, 1989 submission and concluded that it constituted a completepetition. Accordingly, January 27, 1989 is the date on which the statutory120 day period for processing Porsche's petition began. On February 21,1989, this agency decided to grant the company's request under 49 CFR Part512 to treat certain information in the petition regarding location ofantitheft devices in the 928 and 911 carlines as confidential businessinformation. On March 25, 1989, Porsche provided supplemental information,requested by NHTSA, addressing concerns about reliability and durability.In its petition, Porsche included a detailed description and diagrams ofthe identity, design, and location of the components of the antitheft devicefor the Porsche 928 and 911 carlines. The antitheft system for the 928and 911 carlines is the same.The antitheft device is a comprehensive security alarm system that is activatedby removing the key from the ignition and locking either the driver orpassenger door with the key. The central locking system then locks theremaining door and arms the alarm. The alarm monitors the doors, fronthood, rear trunk (911) or hatch (928), radio, and ignition switch. If adoor, front hood or trunk/hatch is opened, the radio removed, or the ignitionswitch moved from the off position without the alarm first being disarmedwith the key, the alarm will go off. When this happens, the horn soundsintermittently and the fog lights and brake lights flash. After 90 seconds,the system resets and turns off the horn and lights. The car will not startso long as the alarm remains armed. If the system agains senses anotherdoor, hood, or hatch being opened, the radio removed, or the engine tryingto be started, the alarm will again activate for 90 seconds. This cyclecontinues for as long as the vehicle has electical power.Porsche also stated that the system is designed to make attempts to defeatthe system difficult and time consuming. The battery in the Porsche islocated in the rear of the vehicle and can only be accessed from insidethe car. The Porsche 911 is a rear engine vehicle and the front hood compartmentis the storage area. The battery is located in the front hood compartmentof the vehicle and can only be accessed by opening the front hood. Thereleases for the hood of both carlines, the hatchback for the 928, andthe rear engine lid for the 911 are all located within the passenger compartment.If the front hood, hatchback or rear engine lid is opened, with the alarmfirst being disarmed with the key, the alarm will sound. For both the Porsche 928 and 911, the power lines from the battery to thealarm system are inside the vehicle and cannot be accessed from outsidethe car. For both models, the alarm control units are solid state and locatedinside the passenger compartment. If a thief should enter the care througha broken window, Porsche asserts it would take a minimum of 15 minutesto gain access to the alarm control unit and would require specific knowledgeof the system in order to successfully bypass it. The thief would thenneed to bypass the ignition lock to start the car.Porsche also stated that a thief cannot gain access to the lock switchesfrom outside the car, even if the lock cylinders are removed, without physicallybreaching the outer metal panels surrounding the locks. All system componentsare of high quality and tested to insure reliability and durability toPorsche's standards. The reliability and durability testing for the antitheftsystem is the same for the 911 and the 928.Porsche believes that the alarm system for both the 928 and 911 carlineswill be as effective in reducing and deterring theft as compliance withthe parts-marking requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFRPart 541), due to the features and functions described in their petition.Based on substantial evidence, the agency believes that the antitheft devicefor Porsche 911 and 928 in Model Year 1990 is likely to be as effectivein reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-markingrequirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR Part 541). This determination is based on the information that Porsche submitted withits petition, and on other available information. The agency believes thatthe device will provide the types of performance listed in 49 CFR Part543.6(a)(3): Promoting activation; attracting attention to unauthorizedentries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the device by unauthorizedpersons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants;and ensuring the reliability and durability of the device. As required by section 605(b) of the statute and 49 CFR 543.6(a)(4), theagency also finds that Porsche has provided adequate reasons for its beliefthat the antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusionis based on the information Porsche provided on its device. This informationincluded a description of reliability and functional tests conducted byPorsche for the antitheft system and its components. The function and designof the Porsche antitheft device is similar to those of other devices, suchas that on the Nissan 300ZX, General Motors Allante, and Audi 5000S thatthe agency previously has considered likely to be at least as effectiveas complying with Part 541 would be. If Porsche decides not to use the exemption for the 928 and 911 carlines,it should formally notify the agency. If this is the case, these carlinesmust be marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR Parts 541.6 and541.5 (marking of major component parts and those replacement parts). The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on theeffectiveness of the pre-standard parts marking programs make it difficultat this early stage of the theft standard's implementation to compare theeffectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness of compliancewith the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such acomparison, which the agency has made on the basis of the limited dataavailable. NHTSA notes that if Porsche wishes in the future to modify the device onwhich this exemption is based, the company may have to submit a petitionto modify the exemption. Section 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemptionapplies only to vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this Partand equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption wasbased. Further, andSection; 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions``(t)o modify an exemption to permit the use of an antitheft device similarto but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which andSection;543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle manufacturers and itself. Theagency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission ofa modification petition for every change in the components or design ofan antitheft device. The significance of many such changes could be <T3>de minimus. </T3>Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if Porsche contemplatesmaking any changes the effects of which might be characterized as <T3>de minimus, </T3>then the company should consult the agency beforepreparing and submitting a petition to modify. <ITAG tagnum="20">(15 U.S.C. 2025, delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: May 25, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey R.
