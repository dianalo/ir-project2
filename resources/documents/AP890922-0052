Outnumbered anti-abortion senators offered little resistanceThursday as the Senate by voice vote agreed to allow federal aid forabortions for pregnancies threatening a woman's life or caused byrape or incest.   The expansion of the government's role in paying for abortionswas included in a measure providing $157.4 billion for health,education and labor programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.Final passage of the bill, and other spending measures, was blockedby Republicans as the two parties worked on an unrelated anti-drugpackage.   Current law limits federal assistance for abortions to pregnantwomen whose lives are endangered. President Bush has promised toveto an expansion of that restriction, and the House last yearrefused to stretch the limits further.   ``House conferees have been very adamant on that point in pastyears, and I'd expect them to be the same this year,'' said Sen.Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., referring to House negotiators who willseek a compromise with their Senate counterparts.   Pro-choice advocates said the vote showed congressional momentumwas shifting their way. But they conceded that based on last year'sexperience _ and Bush's veto promise _ it will be difficult for theSenate language to be enacted.   ``This is the beginning of a very slow road back to where womenwho desperately need access to reproductive health care will haveaccess to it,'' said Pat Reuss, lobbyist for the Women's EquityAction League.   Though they lost ground on abortion, conservatives won pointselsewhere in the legislation.   The Senate voted 95-3 for language sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., blocking federal money for public education on AIDS tostates that don't require authorities or doctors to notify peoplewhose spouses are found to be infected with the AIDS virus. The billprovides $195.8 million for the initiative.   Lawmakers decided by voice vote to bar federal financing ofmaterials for school children ``which promote or encouragehomosexuality, or use words stating that homosexuality is `normal,'or `natural,' or `healthy.''' The measure was introduced by Humphrey.   Senators voted 99-0 to prohibit the use of federal aid to buyhypodermic needles for illegal drug users or bleach to clean theneedles, unless the president certifies that the efforts areeffective.   By another 99-0 tally, they adopted a compromise permittingfederal aid for telling people how to limit the risk of gettingAIDS. The measure allows references to safe ways of engaging insexual acts as well as the risks of engaging in promiscuous sex andintravenous drug abuse.   The legislation also provides $1.6 billion for AIDS research andtreatment, $370 million more than this year; $1.2 billion for addedchild care programs; and $23.7 billion for education, $1 billionabove this year's level.   Earlier this summer, Congress passed legislation easing abortionrestrictions in Washington, D.C., despite a Bush veto threat.   The Senate last year voted 73-19 for the same language itconsidered Thursday. After negotiations with the House, the finalversion only allowed federal aid for pregnant women whose health wasat risk.   This year's House version of the bill, passed Aug. 2, has thesame abortion language as current law.   Since 1981, Congress has limited abortion aid under the Medicaidprogram for the poor to women whose pregnancies are threateningtheir lives.   There were 72 abortions involving rape or incest financed by thefederal government in 1979, the last year for which reliable figuresare available, according to a survey by the private Alan GuttmacherInstitute.   In fiscal 1987 _ the most recent year for which figures areavailable _ the federal government paid for 322 abortions nationwideat a cost of $160,000, the institute says. The study found that thesame year, states paid for 189,000 abortions.   There are an estimated 1.6 million legal abortions in the UnitedStates annually.</TEXT></DOC>
