The resulting alpha particlerange loss distributions provide a direct measurement of the foil thicknessdistribution and hence the instability. The R-T instability has beenobserved in a number of foils with range losses varying between almostzero to over 10 {mu}m. Secondly, a thermonuclear particle backlightingtechnique has been used in the measurement of the stopping power of hotplasma for different materials. The ratio of plasma stopping power tothat of the cold material is measured and compared to a value obtainedfrom theoretical modelling. The solid state nuclear track detector CR-39has been used as a diagnostic for these experiments. A sophisticatedimage analysis system has been developed to enhance and improve datarecovery.</TEXT></DOC>
