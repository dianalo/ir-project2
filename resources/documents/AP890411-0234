The Senate, on a 61-39 vote largely along party lines, backed anamendment to legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., that brought the measure essentially in line with aHouse-passed bill that would boost the minimum wage to $4.55 byOctober 1991.   Rejected, by 58-41, was Bush's proposal to increase the minimumwage by 30 cents a year from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 inJanuary 1992. It was the second time Bush's proposal was defeatedin Congress; the House rejected it three weeks ago.   The Senate's action brought a quick response from the Bushadministration.   ``Today Congress had a golden opportunity,'' Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole said after the vote. ``But Senate Democratssquandered the chance, the first chance in eight years, to raisethe minimum wage.''   More amendments were being considered before the legislationfaced a final Senate vote, likely to come Wednesday, but no furthersignificant changes were expected before then.   ``We compromised,'' said Kennedy, referring to his pastproposals to raise the minimum wage even higher. He also noted anumber of other changes in the legislation, including expandedexemptions for small businesses, to meet Republican concerns.   ``The president's approach is a far superior approach,'' Sen.Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in his unsuccessful effort to win supportfor substituting Bush's proposal for the Kennedy bill.   The action seemed to guarantee the first domestic-policyshowdown between Congress and Bush, barring a compromise while thebill is before a conference committee that will work out minordifferences between the House and Senate versions.   Such a deal, however, appears unlikely.   ``There isn't going to be a compromise,'' said Senate Republicanleader Robert Dole of Kansas. ``It's going to be $4.25 an hour anda six-month training wage, period.''   Democrats nonetheless called on Bush to accept their proposal.   ``If there is any one thing that the 101st Congress must do itis to increase the minimum wage,'' said Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, chastising Bush for opposing a $4.55 anhour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains taxbreaks for the wealthy. ``This legislation will be a test ofwhether we indeed are seeking a kindler, gentler nation,'' saidMitchell.   Both the defeated Bush proposal and the amended Kennedy billcontain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage belowthe federal minimum wage.   Bush has insisted that provision extend for six months to allnewly hired workers, regardless of prior work experience.   Kennedy, like the sponsors of the House bill, balked at thatproposal but to win the support of moderate and conservativeDemocrats agreed on a two-month period during which some employeescould be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage.   That provision was contained in the amendment, offered byDemocratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.   ``Our training wage proposal is a proper balance of the need totrain new workers and the need to set a fair minimum wage,'' saidGraham.   The Graham-Pryor amendment requires an employee to hold one jobfor at least 30 days before the two-month training period wouldexpire. The House-passed bill also allows for a two-month trainingperiod at a subminimum wage but only if the affected employee hadno prior job experience.</TEXT></DOC>
