<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1025 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey is given on the fundamentals of modern solar installations. Thebasic configuration of a solar installation (collector, direct and diffusiveradiation, accumulator, collector circuit, control, additional and axiliaryenergy) as well as the collector (flat construction, covering, insulation,optical losses, optical efficiency, thermal losses, transmission) aredescribed in detail; heat transfer, and heat storage (global radiation,heat exchanger, storage volume). Moreover, the survey deals with thelong-term energie estimation of a solar plant and, finally, refers tothe planning of a solar plant. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
