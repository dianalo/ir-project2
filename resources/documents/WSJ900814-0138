The test will be the first outdoor use inthe U.S. of a recombinant animal virus.   Wistar, a biomedical research center, plans to distributevaccine-laden baits over part of Parramore Island, off theeastern shore of Virginia. The goal is to protect raccoonsagainst rabies. If the trial succeeds, the bait might be usedelsewhere, since raccoons are common carriers of the rabiesvirus. Wistar is especially interested in using the vaccineto control current rabies outbreaks in the mid-Atlanticstates.</LP><TEXT>   Wistar received federal approval for the trial more than ayear ago. But the trial was delayed as the institute soughtclearances from state authorities who had questions aboutsafety and liability. A proposal to do a trial on an islandoff South Carolina was blocked by state health authorities,at least temporarily. Virginia regulators granted approvaljust last month.   Parramore Island, which is owned by the NatureConservancy, has a large raccoon population but isuninhabited by people and lies some four miles from themainland. The choice of a remote island for the trialreflects Wistar's efforts to allay public concerns, thoughthe institute maintains the vaccine poses no hazard. Similartests in the wild have already been carried out in Europe.   Wistar made the vaccine by inserting a small piece ofgenetic material from the rabies virus into vaccinia virus,which serves as a carrier for vaccine delivery. The institutesays the genetic material from the rabies virus isn'tinfectious but can produce a protective immune response. Itadds that it has tested the vaccine in some 35 species incaptivity without ill effects.</TEXT></DOC>
