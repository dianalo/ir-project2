Foxman, national director of theAnti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said Tuesday.   Arafat urged Israel to join in talks under the aegis of theUnited Nations to produce a settlement based on security for allnations of the region, including Israel and a Palestinian state.   ``Yasser Arafat's speech in Geneva can only be described asbitterly disappointing,'' said Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler,president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.   ``He failed to clarify the ambiguities of the Algiers declarationand the hints he dropped in Stockholm,'' said Schindler. ``Ifanything, his speech today was a retreat from his previousstatements.''   Ira Silverman, executive vice president of the American JewishCommittee, said there were ``some positive words'' in Arafat'saddress, but he also called it disappointing.   ``We still wait for clear-cut acceptance of Israel's right toexist and for unconditional rejection of terrorism,'' Silvermansaid. ``Let him match words with deeds.''   ``Yasser Arafat had an opportunity to break with the past andlaunch a new initiative. He blew it,'' said Morris Abram, chairmanof the Conference of Presidents of Major American JewishOrganizations.</TEXT></DOC>
