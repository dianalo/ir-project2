Monday's overwhelming &quot;yes&quot; vote in the constitutional plebiscite has reaffirmed her mandate to govern. But the future of democracy in the Philippines still depends on whether Mrs. Aquino can now lead her country to fortune.    Before the Philippine government hunkers down and starts to implement one of the world's longest and most baroque constitutions, two big issues require Mrs. Aquino's full attention. One is the economy. The other is the communist insurgency. The two are inevitably connected.    Only with a healthy economy is there solid hope for ridding the Philippines of the more than 20,000 communist guerrillas who continue to abuse and murder people in the countryside. A clear stand against the insurgents is more likely to attract investment than Mrs. Aquino's heroic efforts to become the first person on earth to negotiate a lasting peace with hard-core Marxist guerrilla leaders.    To the credit of Mrs. Aquino and her finance minister, Jaime Ongpin, the economy is already making a slow recovery. After drastic declines under President Marcos in 1984 and 1985, gross national product crept up by an officially estimated 0.1% in 1986. For 1987, GNP growth is now projected at somewhere between 3% and 5%.    Behind this recovery are a number of wise moves, some of which have been proceeding quietly while coup attempts and the former defense minister, Juan Ponce &quot;Rambo&quot; Enrile, have been grabbing headlines. The Marcos-era monopolies on goods such as sugar and coconuts have been broken; taxes have been lowered; some state enterprises have been slated for privatization. Non-tariff barriers to trade, such as licenses and quotas, have been converted to tariff barriers for more than 1,000 types of importsa good first step in bringing such inefficiencies into the open, where they can be better eliminated.    Much tough work lies ahead, however. The first steps toward freeing up the economy have probably been the easiest. Under Mr. Marcos there was so much favoritism and waste that almost everyone could agree change was needed. Now, however, special interests have come swarming back with arguments for why their particular industries need protection, subsidies and the traditional favors. Consider the recent debate over what level of tariff should be applied to imported automobile tires. In the interest of Philippine consumers, the answer should be zero. Domestic tire manufacturers have been arguing that it should be closer to 50%. Such arguments can be hard for politicians anywhere to resist, but the time to resist them is at hand, while Mrs. Aquino is still flush with victory.    Decisive action is also needed against the guerrillas. Soon after taking office, Mrs. Aquino released a number of communist leaders from prison, and she has granted them immunity so they could negotiate. She has ordered the military to observe a 60-day cease-fire, due to expire this weekend. None of it has worked. The communists have gone right on extorting their &quot;revolutionary taxes&quot; and murdering people.    In the meantime, the army has become increasingly demoralized. Its unhappiness was evident in the preliminary tallies of Monday's plebiscite. Though the constitution, and Mrs. Aquino, garnered an estimated 79% of the vote, soldiers in the Manila area voted &quot;no&quot; by approximately a three-to-two margin. The armed forces chief of staff, General Fidel Ramos, has interpreted this vote as a reflection of anti-communist sentiment. Given that military support has been needed to put down at least three coup attempts by some of the army's own officers, this disenchantment is cause for concern. The Philippine army would be much better occupied fighting the communists than dislodging its own rebellious troops from hotels and TV stations.    There are good reasons to think that Mrs. Aquino understands these priorities. She has consistently supported Mr. Ongpin's programs. And the concerns of Fidel Ramos can hardly have escaped her attention. While the new constitution mandates a lot of wasteful programs, it does have the virtue of providing Mrs. Aquino with fresh political capital. Where to spend it is clear. </TEXT></DOC>
