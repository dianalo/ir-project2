SullivanandM;Thomas-Conrad Corp. is gearing up to ship the main components in its line offiber-optic networking products, bringing 100M-bps throughput rates to usersfor as little as $1,495 per node.andM;The Thomas-Conrad Networking System (TCNS), which the company demonstrated atthe recent Comdex/Spring trade show in Atlanta, includes industry-standardarchitecture (ISA) and Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA)adapters, an eight-port intelligent concentrator and a network hub manager.andO;The TCNS token-passing technology supports as many as 255 nodes per LAN,distances as long as 5,000 feet between devices, and bridging to ARCnet,Ethernet and Token-Ring networks.andM;While TCNS uses fiber-optic media and offers 100M-bps data-transfer rates, itdoes not support the ISO/ANSI Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)standard.andP;  Thomas-Conrad plans to address that market with future products,said Walt Thirion, CEO and president of the firm.andM;Early users of TCNS said pricing is a key feature of the system.andP;  &quot;Comparedwith FDDI products, TCNS was about 50 to 60 percent less,&quot; said Jim Huggans,a connectivity specialist with a chemical research firm in Texas who is inthe process of installing a TCNS network.andM;The 16-bit TC3045 ISA card costs $1,495, and the 32-bit TC3047 EISA adapteris $1,725.andP;  Supported network operating systems include Novell Inc.'s NetWareand Banyan Systems Inc.'s VINES.andM;The adapters connect to the network through the TCNS Smart Hub, an eight-portfiber-optic unit that lets administrators control and monitor networkoperations.andP;  The $2,295 TC3050 Smart Hub supports HubTalk, a network hubmanager that connects as many as 32 Smart Hubs with twisted-pair cabling.andM;HubTalk, available now, costs $279 for the monitoring software and add-incard.andP;  The other components are slated to be shipped in August.andM;Thomas-Conrad can be reached in Austin, Texas, at (800) 332-8683.andM;----------Additional reporting by Rob O'Regan</TEXT></DOC>
