In many instances, quick resolution of these cases is impossible. In failed institutions, the major portion of the troubled assets is typically in the form of collateralized real-estate loans. It is notoriously difficult to get legal title to the collateral, which cannot be sold until perfected title is acquired. Where bankruptcies are involved, there is even more delay.    Even where a sale is a legal possibility, it often doesn't make economic sense to dispose of these properties. The reason for many of the problems is that the assets involved are located in areas of the country plagued by economic hardship, where realestate markets are seriously depressed.    Selling property in such conditions makes no sense from any point of view. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. would receive very little from the sale's proceeds, thereby increasing its losses. Dumping property would depress these markets further, creating more hardship for other participants. Among them, insured banks and savings institutions would be affected, possibly increasing the number of failed institutions the FSLIC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would have to handle.    Real estate is a very cyclical industry; it often makes the most sense to hold on to property until conditions improve. There is a cost to holding property, but the most cost-effective way may very well be in the insolvent institution with the funding done with insured deposits, one of the most inexpensive sources of credit available. Private developers would build their higher funding costs and profit requirements into the depressed prices they would be willing to pay.    The MCP program is a self-help approach, with responsible executives giving unselfishly of their time and effort for very little reward in order to help the FSLIC work out its problems. The problems that made this program necessary were an outgrowth of deregulation, which was forced on savings institutions before they had time to restructure. During this difficult period the Office of Management and Budget was denying the Bank Board the funds it needed to strengthen its regulatory staff, ignoring the fact that deregulation requires more and better supervision by the regulatory agencies, not less.    William B. O'Connell   President, U.S. League of Savings Institutions    Chicago   ---   As a consulting economist who has done business-plan forecasts for several MCPs, I believe you have overlooked several points. As your article stated, record keeping is often poor. As a result, new management frequently discovers losses incurred but not recorded by old management. To correct the accounting errors, new management is forced to assume these losses, artificially inflating the amount of money that the MCP institution loses.    In addition, if savings and loans in the program were &quot;clean shops&quot; with sound loan/asset portfolios that could be sold at a profit, they probably wouldn't be in the program to begin with. The assets that are there usually need to be &quot;cleaned up&quot; before they can be sold. Unfortunately, this takes time.    When doing financial projections for MCPs, I have had the opportunity to compare projected costs of liquidation with the costs associated with keeping them open. In all cases where such an analysis was done, it was more cost-effective to keep the association operating at small monthly losses than to incur one massive loss by selling a portfolio of substandard assets.    Management in these troubled institutions has inherited a host of problems. One of them is dealing with the public perception that MCPs are slowly bleeding off the resources of the FSLIC. To the contrary, by operating as efficiently as circumstance allows, institutions in the program are saving both the FSLIC and the tax-paying public money. The MCP program didn't create the problem -- it is merely doing its best to cope with it.    Anthony B. Poploskie   Southwest Economics Inc.   Long Beach, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
