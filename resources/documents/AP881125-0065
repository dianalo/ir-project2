Speaking at a Friday prayer sermon, Rafsanjani, also the army'scommander in chief, said if the United States helped free Iranianhostages ``we will also suggest to our well-wishers and friends inLebanon to release any hostages they may have.''   Iranian officials have made similar statements in the past.   Three Iranians, Ahmad Motevaselian, Hussein Musavi and KazemAkhavan, were kidnapped by right-wing Christian Phalangist gunmen innorthern Lebanon in 1982. Their Lebanese driver, who also had anIranian passport, disappeared with them. They are widely believed tobe dead.   The Rt. Rev. John Brown, Anglican bishop for the Persian Gulfregion, went to Lebanon in July hoping to track down the Iranianhostages. He went at the request of the Archbishop of Canterburywhose special envoy, Terry Waite, was kidnapped in January 1987.   The Tehran radio broadcast was monitored in Nicosia.   In Beirut, a magazine reported today that British hostages heldin Lebanon will be freed soon because Britain and Iran have restoredties.   The weekly Ash-Shiraa attributed its report to unidentifiedinformed sources. ``The British hostages held in Lebanon will befreed soon now that Britain and Iran have resumed full diplomaticrelations,'' it said.   The report could not be independently confirmed. Ash-Shiraagained international fame when it broke the story of secret U.S.arms sales to Iran in return for the release of hostages in 1986.But the weekly, published in Moslem west Beirut, has not beenaccurate lately in its reports about the hostages.   Britain and Iran resumed full diplomatic relations Nov. 11.   London broke relations with Tehran in June 1987 after an Iranianenvoy was arrested on shoplifting charges in Manchester, northernEngland, and a British diplomat was assaulted by militants in Tehran.   There are 14 foreign hostages held in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. In addition, a Swiss Red Cross official was kidnapped inthe southern port of Sidon on Nov. 17, but no one has claimedresponsibility.   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held bypro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist JohnMcCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual Britishand Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the Irishgovernment.   The British Foreign Office says it also seeks word on AlecCollett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinianabductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
