Butnothing embarrasses German industry. Even now, some ofGermany's biggest companies are lobbying the government torepeal the &quot;foreign pursuit&quot; clause in the latest Germanexport control law, enacted in the wake of Desert Storm. Thismeasure, known as Article 5(c), empowers the Germangovernment to pursue German persons or companies actingoutside the country who are suspected of illicit export(i.e., proliferation) activities. Just last month, two of thelobbyists -- Degussa, and a subsidiary, Leybold AG -- weresingled out by the International Atomic Energy Agency forhaving provided special equipment for Iraq's nuclear weaponsprogram.   While an accusation does not establish guilt, it was notthe first time these two merited such attention. Leybold isstill under investigation in Germany for having allegedlydelivered blueprints for uranium enrichment centrifuges toPakistan in the mid-1980s, while Degussa has been fined bythe U.S. government for illegal nuclear exports to both Indiaand North Korea.</LP><TEXT>   The IAEA also continues to investigate the possibleinvolvement of German nuclear scientists in the design andoperation of specialized enrichment equipment used inSaddam's bomb plants. &quot;The centrifuge enrichment program wasdefinitely not an indigenous development effort,&quot; a recentIAEA inspection report states.   The role of German companies in Iraq's chemical weaponsprogram has been thoroughly documented. If it hadn't been forGerman companies and German technology, Saddam Hussein wouldnever have been able to develop poison gas.   Although the German government has consistently attemptedto deny knowledge of the activities of its companies, it hasmade some efforts to stop them. In a report to the Bundestagon Aug. 21, 1990, then-Minister of Economics Helmut Haussmannrevealed that German customs officials had raided the officeof several German companies over the previous year and seizedequipment intended for the Iraqi Scuds.   Curiously, all traces of the Iraqi Scuds that hit Israeland Saudi Arabia have disappeared. Moreover, the U.N.inspectors dispatched to Iraq to catalogue Iraq's ballisticmissile force last July were -- for reasons never made public-- instructed to bulldoze the evidence once they hadfulfilled their mission, an action documented on U.N.videotapes.   One German member of the missile inspection team wasdetermined that the evidence of German culpability would notbe erased from human memory. He pried company nameplates frommissile parts and photographed them in order to document theextent of German involvement in the Iraqi Scuds.   These findings were compiled in a confidential reportwhich he delivered to the U.N. Special Commission and theGerman government. The report shows that Iraq's improved Scudmissiles included crucial &quot;specially designed parts&quot; made inGermany, while the launcher was probably a German design fromtop to bottom. Towing vehicles, hydraulics equipment,electrical distributors, erector motors and other equipmentcame from German firms, according to his evidence.   A document appended to the on-site inspection reportsummarizes German Customs investigations into the Scuddeliveries. &quot;The statements and confessions of those involvedshows that at least all of those active in Iraq as part oftheir business did know the character of the projects forwhich they were suppliers.&quot; In short, they were wittingproliferators.   Nuclear weapons, poison gas, ballistic missiles . . . allmade with the aid of German technology. Perhaps the Germangovernment might want to take a closer look at proliferationat home instead of fretting over the problem of emigratingRussian nuclear scientists.   ---   Mr. Timmerman, author of &quot;The Death Lobby: How the WestArmed Iraq,&quot; published by Houghton Mifflin, is the publisherof Mednews, a biweekly newsletter on Middle East securityissues.</TEXT></DOC>
