Davis took over Gulf andamp; WesternInc. six years ago, he had a vision for the conglomerate thatmanufactured bedding products and clothes, turned out airplanepistons and produced books and motion pictures.   Davis, a corporate product of Gulf andamp; Western's ParamountPictures, focused on the company's highly-successful entertainmentand publishing businesses, and began to systematically pare almostall its other segments.   Now his sights have fallen on another media giant, Time Inc.Paramount Communications Inc. _ which Gulf andamp; Western became afterchanging its name on Monday _ offered late Tuesday to buy Time for$10.7 billion.   In a recent advertisement announcing its new name, ParamountCommunications described itself as a leader in entertainment andpublishing and a global communications company.   Time, with holdings like Time-Life Books, Home Box Office andAmerican Television and Communications Corp., would fit right inwith Simon andamp; Schuster and Prentice Hall, part of Paramount'spublishing division, and its Paramount Pictures and Television units.   It also would fit with Martin Davis' vision of what his companyshould be.   ``We will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and bookpublishing, as well as in motion picture and television productionand distribution, cable systems and cable programming,'' he saidabout a Time-Paramount combination in a news release.   Davis, who did not respond to a request for an interviewWednesday, became chairman of Gulf andamp; Western in 1983 upon the deathof Charles G. Bluhdorn. The conglomerate then embraced a widevariety of businesses: sugar, zinc, chemicals, energy products, racetracks, Kayser-Roth apparel and hosiery, Simmons bedding andautomotive, electronic and construction products.   Almost immediately he announced a restructuring plan for thecompany, saying it had become too unwieldy and could not gain themaximum profits possible from its many assets.   Between the fiscal year that began in August 1982 and early 1987,Gulf andamp; Western disposed of more than 50 operations and reduced itsnumber of major business segments from nine to three: financialservices, entertainment and publishing.   The company, which once ran a large stock portfolio, also gave upinvesting in other businesses.   The restructuring slashed the company's annual revenue _ whichfell from $6.42 billion before the restructuring to $3.78 billion inthe year ended Oct. 31, 1986 _ but boosted profits in the sameperiod, to $267.4 million from $168.6 million.   In its most recent fiscal year, ended Oct. 31, 1988, the companyreported revenue of $5.1 billion and income of $384.7 million.   The businesses it kept were prominent and successful. ParamountPictures, for instance, has had some of the biggest movie hits inrecent years: ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Crocodile Dundee'' and the``Star Trek'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' series.   Earlier this year, Davis announced a further honing of hiscompany. Gulf andamp; Western said it would sell The Associates, thenation's third-largest consumer finance company, and get out offinancial services altogether.   It's not surprising Davis would have taken the company down thepath to becoming a communications conglomerate. He began working forParamount Pictures in 1958 as director of sales and marketing, latermoving up to vice president of the company's home office.   By all accounts he is an aggressive and determined executive. In1984 he set out to acquire Prentice-Hall; the bid was initiallyrejected, but Davis won the publisher, paying $710 million.   He appears equally adamant about winning Time. His $175-per-shareoffer was nearly 40 percent higher than Time's closing price Tuesdayof $126 a share.   Davis was undaunted by Time's proposed merger with WarnerCommunications Inc., saying Time essentially put itself up for saleby agreeing to merge with Warner.</TEXT></DOC>
