(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A teen-ager convicted of vehicularhomicide was applauded at his graduation while his victim's motherasked the school board to prohibit felons from receiving diplomas inthe future.   Parents demonstrated last week at Santaluces Community HighSchool after Eric Norstrom was elected prom king. He was convictedearlier in the death of Amber Hunter, 17, who was hit when Norstromdrove into a crowd of youths.   Norstrom received his diploma Wednesday, the same day Amber'smother, Sharon Hunter, went before the Palm Beach County High Schoolin West Palm Beach asking for a change in school policy.   The board agreed to consider Ms. Hunter's suggestion thatconvicted felons be banned from participating in school activities.   Amber was killed March 25, 1988, when Norstrom, racing to make acurfew, plowed into about 100 students at a late-night Boynton Beachstreet party.   At Wednesday's commencement, people cheered longer and louder forNorstrom than any of the other graduates in the Class of 1989.   When guidance counselor Ray Arndt announced his name, Norstromcrossed the stage, getting a hug from Santaluces Principal VeraGarcia and a diploma from school board member Susan Pell. Somespectators and classmates stood for the ovation.   Norstrom, who didn't acknowledge the applause, walked with hishead down while students reached out to shake his hand as he walkedback to his seat.   Norstrum's sentencing hearing was delayed by Palm Beach CircuitJudge Marvin Mounts until after his graduation. The judge willdiscuss sentencing options Monday with Norstrom, the victims'families and attorneys, but actual sentencing may be delayed untilSeptember because of scheduling conflicts.</TEXT></DOC>
