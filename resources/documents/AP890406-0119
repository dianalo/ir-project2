Takeshita, who acknowledged receiving nearly $400,000 inpolitical contributions from the company at the center of thescandal, has vowed to remain in power despite opposition calls forhis resignation and public opinion polls that show as few as 9percent of Japanese support his government.   The news reports said Thursday about 40 influential members ofthe governing Liberal Democratic Party have decided to form thefaction, which demands all those linked to the scandal _ includingparty leaders _ step down.   ``The situation has reached a critical stage,'' they quotedShizuka Kamei, a leading member of the group, as saying. ``Thepresent Liberal Democratic Party is not capable of carrying outself-purification.''   The group also demands the government call former Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone for questioning by legislators on possible linkswith the Recruit Co., an information conglomerate that allegedlyused stock bargains to seek favors.   Opposition parties are boycotting parliamentary deliberations onthe budget, which began Saturday, to back their demands forNakasone's testimony.   On Wednesday, a group of 41 junior party members formed afaction to demand the government push political reforms.   ``Prime Minister Takeshita and Mr. Nakasone should accept theguilt and take appropriate measures to satisfy the people,'' saidfaction leader Hajime Morita. ``Public distrust toward politicscannot be easily erased.''   Some Liberal Democrats have withdrawn from the party, sayingendorsement by the party, which has dominated Japanese politics formost of the postwar era, now would hurt their chances to winelections.   ``Junior politicians ... can lose their political careers unlessthe administration takes drastic measures immediately to restorepublic support toward the LDP,'' said one governing partypolitician Thursday. The member spoke on condition of anonymity.   Takeshita and party Secretary-General Shintaro Abe have beenlinked to the scandal, and another party leader, former FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa, was one of three Cabinet ministers whoresigned because of links to Recruit.   Takeshita, Abe and Miyazawa have denied personal wrongdoing.   Prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen onbribery and securities law violation charges.   Recruit sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary toabout 150 influential people, who reaped large profits when publictrading in the stock began and it rose rapidly in value.   Takeshita suffered another blow Wednesday with reports, which helater confirmed, that Recruit contributed $382,000 to two Takeshitafund-raising parties in May 1987, six months before he became primeminister.   His Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in parliament'slower house, and 143 of the 252 in the upper house. Elections forhalf of the upper house seats must be held this summer, and aseries of setbacks in local elections early this year has worriedupper house party candidates.   A 3 percent sales tax that took effect Saturday, along with cutsin income taxes and some other taxes, also has contributed to theTakeshita government's unpopularity in the polls.</TEXT></DOC>
