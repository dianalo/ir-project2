AMC's board said yesterday it would recommend shareholder approval of the Chrysler proposal. Chrysler said it also reached a separate definitive agreement after 2 1/2 months of negotiations with AMC's main shareholder, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, which owns 46.1% of AMC. Highland Park, Mich.-based Chrysler has set different terms for Renault's stake than for other shareholders, and it didn't raise its proposal to Renault, Robert S. Miller, Chrysler vice chairman, said.    The total value of both transactions could reach $1.18 billion in stocks, bonds and cash, up from $1.11 billion. As previously reported, the final price is contingent upon Southfield, Mich.-based AMC's long-term financial performance.    Under the new proposal, the price tag for the AMC common and preferred shares not held by Renault increases to about $595 million from $522 million, according to a source close to the negotiations.    Chrysler's board approved the proposals -- which were completed after several missed deadlines -- in Savannah, Ga., last night, where they were meeting to prepare for today's annual meeting. Renault's board must still approve the proposal, and is expected to meet today.    AMC shareholders are expected to vote on the proposal within 90 days. Regulators in the U.S., France, and Canada also must approve the proposal.    Joseph E. Cappy, AMC's president and chief executive officer, said the board &quot;believes that the merger on these terms is in the best interests of the stockholders. . . . The marketing and financial clout of Chrysler behind our state-of-the-art and highly competitive products should make these products even bigger winners.&quot;    Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said, &quot;We have said all along that we believe the combination of Chrysler and American Motors will be good for the stockholders, employees and dealers of both companies. We hope that final approvals can be obtained quickly.&quot;    Analysts maintained their bullish assessment of the proposal, even with the increased price. &quot;No matter how you look at it, Chrysler's getting a lot of value for what it is paying,&quot; said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Chrysler brings a lot of value to AMC, AMC brings a lot of value to Chrysler.&quot;    Specifically, Chrysler is expected to benefit greatly from AMC's popular Jeep line -- its only consistently profitable product -- and AMC's state-of-the-art assembly facility in Bramlea, Ontario. The two companies still have complications to smooth out surrounding the combination, such as coordinating the product lines, the dealerships, and the employees.    Chrysler said it will pay holders of AMC common shares the equivalent of $4.50 a share in Chrysler stock. The companies also set maximum and minimum amounts of Chrysler stock the AMC shareholders would receive, so the final price could vary. If Chrysler's stock averages $41.78 for a two-week period ending one week before the closing date, AMC shareholders could get a higher value. If Chrysler's stock drops below $34.19 for that period, they could get less, but one source close to the negotiations said AMC might seek a change in the terms in that event.    Chrysler stock closed at $34.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, down $1.25, while AMC closed at $4.25, up 12.5 cents. AMC was the second most-actively traded stock, with 5.4 million shares changing hands.    AMC also said Chrysler raised its bid for convertible preferred shares outstanding, offering $1.04 for each such share in addition to the common stock equivalent.    Chrysler made its original bid for AMC March 9, saying it had reached a tentative agreement for Renault's stake. At that point it needed a definitive accord from the French auto maker and an endorsement from AMC's board.    Originally, Chrysler said it hoped to wrap up the negotiations by late April at the latest, then extended the deadline twice without success. The negotiations were complicated because Chrysler will continue to market Renault products and maintain other contracts with Renault. But &quot;there haven't been any changes in the basic elements of the deal with Renault,&quot; Chrysler's Mr. Miller said.    AMC officials were at first unhappy with the Chrysler bid because they felt AMC had turned the corner -- reporting two consecutive profitable quarters -- and could stay independent.    &quot;We felt that $4 was more than fair,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;But after having 2 1/2 more months to kick the tires . . . we felt the right thing to do to be fair to all sides was make it $4.50 and get it over with.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
