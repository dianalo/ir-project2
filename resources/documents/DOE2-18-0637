In particular,recent re-evaluations of epidemiological data on human population exposedto radiation have suggested that there may be greater sensitivity thanheretofore recognized to the induction of mental retardation and reducedintelligence by exposure during gestation. To assist national authoritiesin evaluating this problem and establishing appropriate protection measuresfor limiting the dose to the embryo and fetus and, thus, to pregnantor potentially pregnant women, the Nuclear Energy Agency has appointeda Group of Consultants to assemble and evaluate the biological data relevantto the protection of the human conceptus, and to make recommendationsfor achieving this in the operational practice. The Group has surveyedthe human data dealing with the biological effects of radiation exposureat low doses, and has supplemented this with information derived fromanimal studies. The Group has also taken full account of the studiesand recommendations issued in this area by other international organizations,primarily the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of AtomicRadiation (UNSCEAR) and the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection (ICRP). This report is published under the responsibilityof the Secretary General of the OECD, and does not commit Member governmentsor the Organization.</TEXT></DOC>
