GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson says he can rally his supportersbehind certain Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis even if he's notDukakis' running mate, if the two can agree on key policy issues.   Jackson said it was premature to discuss whether he willactively seek the vice presidential spot on the Democratic nationalticket.   But by virtue of his performance in the primaries, ``we'veearned the right for serious consideration, and if there is acriteria by which one qualifies for consideration we'll pass it,''said Jackson, speaking to reporters on Monday.   Even if his name isn't on the ticket, Jackson said he coulddeliver his supporters for the Massachusetts governor, ``so long asour agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''   Jackson said negotiations with the Dukakis camp so far ``arehaving an impact on broadening and strengthening the DemocraticParty.''   He praised a weekend agreement with Dukakis backers to brandSouth Africa a ``terrorist state'' as part of the Democratic Partyplatform.   Jackson made his remarks a day after representatives of bothDemocratic Party presidential candidates held the first in a seriesof platform-drafting meetings at Mackinac Island, Mich. Therepresentatives announced they had agreed on the South Africa issue.   This ``is a step in the right direction for America because wemust regain our credibility and our moral authority in the thirdworld as leader of the free world,'' Jackson told reporters at theimpromptu sidewalk news conference.   But Jackson said differences over other issues remain. Jackson,for instance, is calling for a freeze on military spending, whichDukakis hasn't supported. Jackson said a freeze would give us``money to pay for our dreams,'' including health care, housing andsenior citizens' programs.   Meanwhile, in an interview published today, Jackson calledChicago the nation's most racially divided city.   The racial tensions in Chicago are ``not representative ofwhat's happening in American today,'' Jackson told the ChicagoTribune.   ``I can't think of another city in the country right now whereyou have the kind of confrontation without shame along racial linesthat you now have in our City Council-type squabbles,'' he said.   ``That's not L.A., that's not St. Louis, that's not any othermajor city I know, and it's really beneath the dignity of thecity,'' Jackson said in a meeting with the editorial board of theChicago Tribune.   Jackson was in Chicago for meetings with his national staff todiscuss plans for next month's Democratic National Convention.</TEXT></DOC>
