The apparatus has two parts. One part is a measuring probewhich contains means for measuring the magnetic susceptibility and themagnetic field, and, in a cryostat, three gradient meters. The otherpart consists of a processing unit which comprises an integrator forcarrying out integration of the gradient meter data, a multiplier formultiplying the magnetic field by the susceptibility and a subtractorfor subtracting this product from the result of the integration.</TEXT></DOC>
