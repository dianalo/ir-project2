In Pakistan, U.S.-backed guerrillas said government fighter jetsblasted villages north of Kabul after residents refused to pressureguerrillas to open a key stretch of highway used to carry insupplies from the Soviet Union.   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani saidsoldiers conducted search operations at four areas to the west,east and southwest of Kabul.   ``The operation is still continuing and our brave soldiers aresuccessfully recovering arms and ammunition,'' he said. Mortarshells, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, rockets and ammunitionwere recovered, he said.   Amani did not mention any fighting during the operation.   The offensive comes after the Moslem guerrillas launched 19rockets into the city over the weekend, killing 46 people andwounding 121 others.   At least 43 people were killed Saturday when the guerrillaslaunched eight rockets. The barrage resumed Sunday when 11 rocketslanded in the city, killing three people.   Also Monday, a bomb exploded in a restaurant in the city center,injuring at least seven people.   Mohammad Faizullah, a restaurant employee said the bomb made adeep crater on the floor, shattered window panes and destroyedfurniture.   ``Had the bomb exploded during lunch or dinner time, many peoplewould have died,'' he said. The blast took place in the afternoon,he said, when few people were in the restaurant.   The guerrillas were believed responsible for the explosion, butno arrests were reported.   Fazle Akbar, of the pro-rebel Afghan Information andDocumentation Centre in Pakistan, said that since Friday,government planes blasted the villages of Shakardara, Mir Bacha Kotand Qara Bagh, along a 35 mile stretch of the Salang Highway northof the Afghan capital.   There was no estimate of damage or casualty figures and thereport could not be independently confirmed.   Akbar said the attacks came after Afghan President Najib, in ameeting Friday, was unable to persuade elders from villages northof Kabul to put pressure on the guerrillas to stop attacking supplyconvoys.   The guerrillas, also based in neighboring Iran, have beenfighting the Soviet-backed government for the past 11 years.   They control most of the countryside and the government's armyhas maintained control of the cities after a Soviet troop pulloutwas completed in February.
