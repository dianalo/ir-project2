But the issues are so tough that even goodwill and determinationhave not cleared away all the roadblocks to quick completion of theaccords.   President Bush's confident prediction last spring that the NATOand Warsaw Pact alliances could conclude a treaty in Vienna toreduce armies and armories in Europe within six months to a yearappears to have been an overstatement.   Key U.S. government officials attending an arms control seminarthis week on the Eastern Shore of Maryland rated chances offulfilling Bush's prediction as slim.   Speaking on condition their names not be used, they were equallydubious about quickly wrapping up U.S.-Soviet treaties to sharplyreduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines and tooutlaw further production of chemical weapons.   Bush has excluded arms control as a major topic at hisMediterranean near-summit next month with Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev _ a session being billed as a get-acquainted meeting,one without a set agenda.   But the full-dress summit being planned for Washington nextsummer could look like a near-even as well if there are no majorarms control accords to sign.   And yet, a half-dozen well informed officials rated as slim theprospects for an agreement by summer. It seemed that onlypoliteness and loyalty kept them from simply saying, ``No way.''   Both a Conventional Forces in Europe agreement and a StrategicArms Limitation Treaty were described as no more than ``long-shot''possibilities by next summer by one key official. He rated thechances of a chemical weapons pact as even slimmer.   And yet by Christmas the United States and the Soviet Union planto be exchanging information about their chemical arsenals andproduction facilities. Inspections probably will start in May.   The idea is to see that the agreement being negotiated inGeneva, Switzerland, is not undercut by cheating. That means beingable to detect chemical weapons that can be produced virtually in abroom closet and which can be carried in a small satchel.   Verification procedures also are being explored for theprospective pacts on strategic weapons reductions and on troops,tanks and artillery in Europe.   But no one has found a way yet to keep perfect track of cruisemissiles carried aboard submarines and surface vessels.   The Soviets have agreed to deal with that problem separately,but that is turning out to be only a procedural shift. The Pentagonwill resist severe restrictions on the sea-based weapons. And theSoviets, who are far behind in the field, want to curb them.   When it comes to reducing non-nuclear weapons in Europe, some ofthe NATO allies are turning out to be more difficult in some waysthan Moscow. They are not warm to the idea of Soviet inspectors intheir tank plants, for instance.   The Soviets are described as eager to complete the treaty, ifonly to turn their technicians and factories to the production ofconsumer goods.   But they are also trying to retain some 1,000 airplanes thatNATO insists are not entirely for the defense of Soviet territoryand, therefore, subject to limitations.   And Bush administration officials are already worried thatwhatever anti-cheating devices are attached to the three accordsthe Senate might decide they are not airtight and blockratification.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid covers foreign policy and armscontrol for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
