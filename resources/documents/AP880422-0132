The bill, passed Thursday by a vote of 312-107, targets foreignmarkets closed to U.S. industry.   ``The government of Japan will continue to reiterate itsapprehension to the U.S. side, the administration in particular,hoping strongly that such a bill will not be enacted,'' ForeignMinister Sosuke Uno said.   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,charged that ``anti-Japanese'' sentiment was behind the action,Kyodo News Service reported.   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi, in a nationally televisednews conference, warned that Japan-U.S. relations and the worldeconomy would suffer if the Senate approved the bill.   He said, however, ``I have strong expectations that in the finalstage the bill will not be passed, the Senate included.''   The bill, which the Senate was to begin debating Friday,includes two provisions regarded as threatening to Japanesebusiness.   One provision gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutterpower to decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by anothercountry, and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions againstToshiba Corp. and its subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co., which soldsubmarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet Union in violation of aWestern trade agreement on sensitive technology exports.   Hajime Tamura, minister for international trade and industry,said he ``deeply regretted'' passage of the omnibus trade bill. ``Iam expecting that President Reagan will take veto action,'' he said.   ``While I do not think it will be passed in the Senate in theend, I will urge the U.S. administration (to block the bill) andawait the common sense of the American people,'' Tamura said.   The bill, shorn of many features criticized as too protective ofU.S. industry, included a controversial item opposed by Reagan. Theprovision, which Reagan said will move him to veto the entire bill,called for advance notice in the event of certain plant closingsand employee layoffs.   But it lacked what for Japan would have been a more damagingamendment, which would have imposed sanctions against countriesthat the United States judged to have achieved large tradesurpluses through unfair means.</TEXT></DOC>
