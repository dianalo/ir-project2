It plans to build grids for shopping, bookingtickets, checking data and sending documents.   Singapore's small size and centralized bureaucracysimplified establishing the electronic groundwork. Allcitizens carry a numbered identification card, allowingcross-indexing of data. &quot;The purpose . . . is to turnSingapore into an intelligent island in which IT {informationtechnology} will be fully exploited to improve businesscompetitiveness and, more importantly, to enhance the qualityof life,&quot; an education ministry official said. A master plan,IT 2000, will be unveiled at year end.   Already, TradeNet lets companies submit dataelectronically to the state and accounts for 90% of all tradedocuments.

EC PLEDGES CHOLERA AID                                                                                                          The European Community pledged $700,000 in emergencymedical aid to victims of a cholera epidemic in Peru. It alsois sending medicine and equipment. The death toll exceeded70, among more than 8,500 cases reported. The outbreak, whichbegan in late January, poses a regional threat. Lima hastaken emergency measures such as water sterilization, but theepidemic has spread to parts of the highlands and jungleareas previously untouched by the disease.

SURVEY ON JAPAN'S LABOR WOES                                                                                                          Labor-saving investment will account for an increasinglylarge proportion of Japanese capital outlays, reflectingwidespread expectations that the country's labor shortagewill worsen, a survey shows. The poll by the Long-Term CreditBank of Japan found 59% of Japanese companies polled expectthe labor shortage to worsen over the next four to fiveyears.   After four consecutive years in which Japan's grossnational product grew 5% or more, labor has grownincreasingly tight. Unemployment has hovered at 2.1% sinceJune 1989. Corporate spending for robots and factoryautomation has continued to expand.   Service-sector companies that rely heavily on labor, suchas transportation and construction concerns, are especiallyhard hit by the labor shortage.   The bank predicted manufacturers will boost capitaloutlays aimed at labor saving to 18% from 15% andnon-manufacturers to 6.6% from 2.1%.
