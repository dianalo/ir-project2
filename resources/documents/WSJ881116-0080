Dealers describe the trade figures as crucial for the U.S. currency, and say the numbers may be the most important economic data for determining the direction of the dollar for the rest of the year.    Today &quot;is a key day,&quot; said Michael Guarino, vice president and chief dealer with Algemene Bank NV in New York. &quot;Everyone is expecting the deficit to be narrower than $12.2 billion.&quot;    The August U.S. trade deficit was announced at $12.18 billion after seasonal adjustment. A Dow Jones poll of 14 economists showed the average estimate of the September trade deficit to be $10.5 billion. Market players estimate a deficit of between $9.5 billion and $11 billion.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.7428 marks, down from 1.7458 marks late Monday, and at 123.23 yen, down from 123.75 yen. The pound traded at $1.8088, down from $1.8090.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 123.58 yen, up from Tuesday's close of 123.25 yen.    Better-than-expected U.S. trade figures would help temper the overwhelmingly bearish market sentiment toward the dollar, Mr. Guarino said, but he warned that &quot;if the market sees a double-digit deficit, you will have to hold onto your hat.&quot;    If there is a poor U.S. trade performance, he said the dollar would again be attacked by the market, and it would take concerted, heavy intervention by the central banks of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to restore stability. G-7 countries include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.    During Tuesday's Asian trading, the Bank of Japan continued to intervene in the open market by buying dollars at the 123.50-yen level and the 123.35-yen level. Tokyo dealers described the intervention efforts as small and probably aimed more at stabilizing the dollar-yen exchange rate than at pushing the dollar higher. The U.S. Federal Reserve wasn't spotted conducting open-market operations.    Also, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reiterated statements that G-7 central banks will continue to seek currency stability and would undertake cooperative intervention to achieve this goal.    The dollar received limited support from statements by Bank of England Gov. Robin Leigh Pemberton who said he thought it would be better if the dollar didn't fall and that there hasn't been any change in the exchange-rate policy of the G-7 nations since they last met in September.    Despite the jawboning, market rumors that the Fed would boost its discount rate proved to be more supportive of the dollar than statements by monetary officials. The rumor pushed the dollar to its intraday highs of 123.65 yen and 1.7490 marks before it came under selling pressure. Although traders decline to rule out the possibility of a discount-rate boost, the rumor eventually was shrugged off.    &quot;A discount-rate hike is usually a last resort for the Fed,&quot; said John Lynam, vice president with Security Pacific International Bank in New York. &quot;I would expect a tightening of Fed funds to 8.5% and then intervention (in the open market) before they would use a discount-rate hike.&quot;    Given the market's bearishness toward the dollar, traders say even a strong September trade performance may serve only to give the U.S. currency a slight boost before it resumes its downward trend.    The market remains bearish because of its suspicions that U.S. President-elect George Bush would like to see the dollar lower as part of his efforts to try to cure the twin U.S. trade and budget deficits.    Mr. Guarino said such feelings are reinforced by the fact that Mr. Bush and U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady made supportive comments on the dollar only after stock and bond markets lost ground. He said the implication is that a lower dollar concerns Mr. Bush only when it threatens to disrupt capital and equity markets.    But Mr. Lynam said: &quot;You have to look at the risk in a falling dollar. They (the central banks) won't be able to stop it if the market wants to sell the dollar.&quot;    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $424.40 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $424.10 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
