The big telecommunications company, which is building and laying the bulk of the cable, said problems with parts in 125 repeaters are forcing ATandamp;T to replace them. Repeaters correct distortion and restore the strength of electrical signals.    The cable, a $335 million project that is owned by 29 companies and countries, was scheduled to begin transmitting phone and computer calls between the U.S. and Europe in July. It is the first major undersea fiber-optic phone cable. ATandamp;T, which holds a 37% stake in the project, said it has notified customers of the delay. </TEXT></DOC>
