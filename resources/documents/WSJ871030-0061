I'm very concerned about the downward spiral in the stock and currency markets. This is really a chaotic situation.&quot;    Japanese hopes for the stock market rest on the assumption that the nation's current economic recovery is safe from additional foreign-exchange shocks. After all, the yen had soared against the dollar and gained against other currencies, so the reasoning has gone, and more turbulence wasn't expected.    But it came. Torrential dollar selling drove the U.S. currency below 140 yen on Wednesday for the first time since April, and yesterday pushed it at one point to a 40-year low of 137.10.    The Nikkei stock average continued its decline on the foreign-exchange news, dropping 543.64 points yesterday, to 22033.89, while prices rose in London and soared in New York. The losses in Tokyo equities are still smaller than the setbacks in New York and London. As of yesterday, the Nikkei had fallen by a cumulative 16.6% from its Oct. 15 level, while New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 17.7% and London's Financial Times 100-share index by 26.9% in the same period.    At the close of the Friday morning session in Tokyo, the Nikkei average surged 662.60, to 22696.49.    Japanese shares have shown this resilience even though they lack the fundamental strengths -- and the returns -- that many securities analysts say make U.S. stocks a bargain at their recent lows. Price-earnings ratios for shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are astronomical, averaging more than 60 to 1. (The P-E ratio, or the price of a share divided by earnings per share for a 12-month period, is a common way of assessing a stock's underlying value.)    One of the main reasons for the relative robustness of Japanese shares is expectations that Japanese corporate earnings will rise along with expansion of the domestic economy. This notion has been challenged, though, by the prospect of continuing dollar decline. Further appreciation of the yen would hurt Japanese manufacturers, which still rely heavily on export markets and have only recently adjusted to currency levels set by major industrialized countries last February in the Louvre agreement.    &quot;Most Japanese companies overcame the last stage of yen appreciation and are showing profits again,&quot; said a bond underwriter at a top Japanese brokerage house. &quot;Now they'll have to fight again.&quot;    The &quot;weight of money&quot; theory -- which holds that excess liquidity from Japan's huge trade surplus has few alternatives but to flow into the Tokyo stock market -- is another popular explanation for the resistance of Japanese share prices. Economists note, however, that Japan's current-account surplus is contracting rapidly and that far less new money is being generated for securities investment.    Another factor ballooning the price of certain speculative issues, and stimulating the overall stock market, has been the belief that companies could use undeveloped real estate to generate huge profits. But Japan's recent land boom shows signs of running out of steam, with urban land prices beginning to decline, analysts warn.    Finally, there is the belief that Ministry of Finance regulators recently have been extending a bureaucratic &quot;invisible hand&quot; to prop up the stock market so the government can reap higher revenues when it sells shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. and Japan Air Lines to the public in November and December.    Financial authorities deny any effort at manipulation, however. And some observers question whether the ministry has the power to control the volatile stock exchange when trading is whipped by forces from outside of Japan. &quot;At one time, it was a reality, but ministry control of the market is slowly becoming a myth,&quot; said a senior analyst for a foreign brokerage in Tokyo. &quot;There are a lot more independently minded institutional investors active in the market today.&quot;    It isn't clear whether the absence of these market influences could lead to a new crash in Tokyo share prices. Japanese cultural traits such as optimism and national solidarity could influence the direction of the market. Bearishness remains a kind of taboo. &quot;People would never volunteer to prophesy that there could be a free fall,&quot; said Industrial Bank of Japan's Mr. Taketomi.    Mr. Taketomi says he hopes the world's leading economic powers can renew an agreement to coordinate monetary policies. &quot;It seems as though the recovery is genuine and sustainable, depending on the stability of the international economic environment,&quot; he said. &quot;If the dollar stays within the 135-yen to 145-yen range, maybe our export industry can muddle through.&quot;    Ron Napier, vice president in charge of equity research at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., disputes the view that Japanese stocks are weak on fundamentals. Low dividend yields from Japanese stocks are acceptable because bond yields are also low in Tokyo, he says, so the wide differential in returns that some analysts believe precipitated the plunge in New York share prices is absent.    High P-E ratios also are deceptive, he said, because they fail to account for profits generated by overseas subsidiaries and projected growth in earnings by the parent companies.    Mr. Napier views the Nikkei stock average's recent floor of about 22,000 points as more technical than psychological. &quot;It doesn't seem to want to go below that point,&quot; he said. &quot;If U.S. prices were to absolutely plunge from here, I think the Tokyo Stock Exchange would be dragged along with it. But I don't see the Tokyo market triggering a second collapse of world stock prices.&quot;    Still, some analysts in Tokyo caution that a catastrophic plunge in Japanese prices, though unlikely, remains a real danger as long as uncertainty prevails in the international financial scene.    &quot;It's a possibility,&quot; said an analyst at a Japanese brokerage who asked not to be identified. &quot;A lot of these stocks just don't have value. They're empty. But where else can the money go?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
