The House took the first step late last night by approving a tax and spending bill that contained the bulk of the savings foreseen in that accord. Congressional leaders vowed to work all night, if necessary, to finish that bill and a $600 billion omnibus spending bill that would fund the federal government through the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.    &quot;We must make the decision that the U.S. is ready to do its job, and to show that a bipartisan agreement can be carried out,&quot; said House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) in urging his colleagues to support the budget package.    Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois added, &quot;Think about what happens if it goes down. . . . We can't undo anything that has moved us to this point. This conference report fits into the parameters agreed to with the president.&quot;    The House passed the tax and spending measure by a vote of 237-181, and the Senate was expected to take it up promptly.    Late last night, White House aides informed lawmakers that President Reagan approved the contents of the House-passed bill, boosting the effort to complete the budget bills last night. But other obstacles remained, raising the prospect that the federal government might have to close down today.    The spending bill also advanced last night when a House-Senate conference approved its final details and sent it to both chambers. The way was cleared for its enactment when the conferees removed from the bill a provision that would enact into law a measure requiring radio and television broadcasters airing controversial material to offer free air time for opposing views.    President Reagan had threatened to veto any bill that would enact the measure, which the Federal Communications Commission abolished in August. Lawmakers said it would be easier to pass the omnibus bill with the provision excised.    Under an extension approved Sunday, the government's spending authority was set to expire at the end of yesterday. But even if the government officially closes down, many operations would continue today, because each agency or department head may decide which public services are essential and should continue.    Retirement checks would be processed and mailed today, for example, and all services related to safety and health -- such as air-traffic control and military operations -- would continue, according to spokesmen for the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management. Post offices would be open and the mail will be delivered as usual because the Postal Service generates its own revenues through postal rates.    Congressional actions last night were being driven by a budget accord reached Nov. 20 after prolonged negotiations between White House officials and congressional leaders. It calls for $30.2 billion in reductions from the projected fiscal deficit for fiscal 1988. And, in fact, the combined savings of the two bills pending in Congress would reduce the projected deficit this fiscal year by more than $33 billion.    The accord includes $7.6 billion in savings in discretionary spending programs, which are contained in the omnibus spending bill. Those savings include cuts of $5 billion in military spending and $2.6 billion in nonmilitary spending. The omnibus spending bill also would include $7.6 billion in receipts from sales of government assets and prepayments of U.S. loans.    The second bill holds $17.6 billion in savings, including a tax increase of $9 billion, $650 million in user fees sales, and reductions in Medicare of $2.1 billion and in farm subsidies of $1 billion.    In addition, savings of about $1 billion in interest on the national debt are assumed.    Still, fiscal 1988 spending would increase by about $47 billion from the prior year even if the bills are enacted; the savings come from an inflated base. What's more, this year's deficit isn't likely to be reduced below the $148 billion in fiscal 1987.    The aim of the exercise is to replace the $23 billion in across-the-board cuts of the Gramm-Rudman budget law, which are now in effect by presidential decree, with legislated savings of equal size. Actual deficit-reductions contained in the bill, not counting some one-time savings and accounting gimmicks, approximate that amount.    Lawmakers struggled throughout the day to tie the loose ends on the bills. One of the stickiest points concerned Medicare. House and Senate conferees completed work on provisions that would save $2.1 billion this fiscal year in the Medicare program, which provides health services for the elderly and disabled. But the White House hesitated until after 8 p.m. to accept the change.    The House-passed package would raise $23 billion in taxes over two years, and would hit corporations and wealthy individuals the hardest. It would increase taxes by $9 billion this fiscal year and $14 billion the next year.    The package would halve the amount of income that defense contractors can defer under the completed-contract method of accounting. It would speed up corporations' estimated tax payments, and prevent corporations from escaping taxes when they dispose of the assets of another company they acquire.    The legislation would end the installment-sales method of accounting used by large manufacturers and homebuilders to defer taxes on sales made on credit until they actually receive payment. Last year's tax law partially disallowed the technique, but the legislation would restore it for &quot;casual&quot; sellers of real estate and small businesses.    The package would forbid interest deductions on home-equity loan amounts exceeding $100,000, and cap the amount of mortgage debt eligible for interest deductions at $1 million. It would freeze the existing estate tax rate at 55% for five years. It had been scheduled to fall to 50% next year. The 3% telephone tax would be extended for three years.    And lawmakers agreed to raise the limit on the Treasury's authority to issue long-term bonds by $20 billion, which is expected to be adequate to get the government through its bond auctions planned for this spring.    The legislation also would make spending cuts in agriculture of $1 billion this fiscal year and $1.5 billion in fiscal 1989. Most of the savings comes from adjustments to target prices and loan rates for major agricultural commodities. The bill also removes the existing monetary limit on the Commodity Credit Corp.'s authority to borrow from the Treasury.    The bill would tighten limits on farm payments, and permit wheat and feed grain producers to idle all their acreage and still receive 92% of the payments that would be due normally. Savings would result, however, because storage costs would be reduced and such farmers wouldn't be eligible to receive price-support loans.    The Medicaid program for low-income individuals would receive about $600 million in additional funding in the bill.    Another provision lawmakers placed into the House-passed bill would significantly alter the regulation of pension plans. Under the provision, employers whose pension plans are underfunded would be forced in 1989 to put more money into their plans faster than under current law. And starting next year, the employer-paid fee to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. would rise to at least $16 per employee per year from the current $8.50. Employers with underfunded pensions could pay as much as $50 per employee under the new system to help the burdened federal agency.    The omnibus spending bill would:    --Allow President Reagan to prevent Japanese companies from participating in federally funded construction projects. The provision would prevent contractors and suppliers in another country from bidding on or supplying construction projects funded by the U.S. if the foreign country prevents U.S. companies from participating in its projects.    --Provide a total of $8.1 million in aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The arrangement would also establish a procedure for congressional handling of future White House requests for Contra funds. The package was a victory for the Reagan administration.    --Designate Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the only site to be looked at to see if it is safe to store nuclear waste underground. The provision was included over Nevada lawmakers' objections.    --Prohibit for eight months the imposition of sanctions on places that have failed to plan adequately to meet the standards of the Clean Air Act. Several metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth, have been found in violation of the requirements of the law.    --Ban cigarette smoking on flights of two hours or less in duration. The prohibition would begin four months after the provision is enacted and would expire in two years.    --Provide a 2% pay raise in January for federal civilian and military employees. Members of Congress, whose two raises early this year brought their salaries to $89,500, exempted themselves and other senior government officials from another increase.    --Fund a single-warhead, mobile missile system called Midgetman at $700 million, reversing earlier efforts in the Senate to slash the funding.    ---   Monica Langley contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
