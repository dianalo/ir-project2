(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Groupware, GUIs and CPU-power fuel end-user reformandM;End-user computing today isn't just at the leading edge of informationtechnology, it is the leading edge.andM;PCs, local area networks, groupware, executive support systems, desktoppublishing, etc., are the focus of most of the change happening in the worldof corporate computing.andM;Where exactly is that change leading?andM;To find out, Computing Canada talked to three top systems consultants: ArtCaston, a partner with Toronto-based DMR Group Inc., Lloyd Davidson, amanager at Peat Marwick Stevenson Kellogg in Toronto, and Bob Fabian apartner with Toronto-based Gellman Hayward andamp; Partners Ltd.andM;To get a grassroots perspective, we also talked to a real live end-usercomputing manager -- STeve Bowden, newly-appointed manager of InformationServices andamp; Data Resources at 3M Canada Inc. in London, Ont.andM;Here, compiled from their comments and in no particular order, is a list ofthe several most important trends in end-user computing to emerge in the last12 to 18 months.andM;&quot;Real&quot; LAN ApplicationsandM;&quot;LAN usage has deepened over the last year or so,&quot; says Davidson.andP;  &quot;It's likefive years ago when PCs first started coming in: people bought them to do onething but then found they could keep adding applications -- without everhaving to purchase new hardware.&quot;andM;Davidson and Fabian both point to the introduction this year of softwaresupporting client server LAN architectures--SQL Server from Sybase inparticular -- as an important breakthroughandM;A client-server architecture allows workstations on a network to moreintelligently share processing tasks with servers.andM;This year also saw a proliferation of good LAN-based e-mail packages, Castonsays.andP;  &quot;They're incredibly functional: built-in filing, directory management,standard forms to fill out -- all done with icons, and all very low cost.&quot;andM;Along with the emergence of X.400 packages which allow wide and local areae-mail transmissions between different types and makes of hardware, the newfunctionality in LAN e-mail &quot;enables&quot; what Caston calls &quot;document mail.&quot;andM;Instead of just sending simple text messages, LAN users will be able to movecompound documents -- text, spreadsheets, and bit-mapped graphics -- inrevisable form.andP;  And that, in turn, will enable true work group processing,including efficient co-authoring of documents, Caston believes.andP;  &quot;We'regetting the synergy now that we've been looking for the last dozen years,&quot; hesays.andM;The other &quot;enabler&quot; of work group processing and co-authoring is theproliferation of groupware -- software such as Higgins and The Communicatorthat allows members of a work group on a LAN to share calendars, phone lists,scheduling and agenda information, and append notes to circulated documents.andM;3M's Bowden, meanwhile, interjects a note of grassroots reality in thediscussion of LANs.andP;  &quot;We've moved very slowly and cautiously on LANs at 3M,&quot;he admits.andP;  &quot;We're not going to get into LANs just for the sake of gettinginto LANs.andP;  Our users have to show that there's a strong business case forsharing information, not just for sharing hardware.&quot;andM;Ooey GUI GoodandM;&quot;It is now clear that a GUI (graphic user interface) is a necessary anddesirable thing,&quot; says Caston.andP;  &quot;The only question that remains in which onedo you adopt.&quot;andP;  Not everyone on our panel was quite so categorical, but allmentioned the growing importance of the GUI.andM;This much, at least, is clear, says Fabian: a consistent graphic interfaceusing windows, icons, a mouse and pull-down menus definitely reduces learningtime when introducing computers to neophytes.andP;  And that is clearly importantto many organizations.andM;The success of the Apple Macintosh proves it, Fabian says.andP;  In fact, Davidsonsays recent A.C.andP;  Nielson figures show the Mac in a tight race for PC marketshare in Canada -- much tighter than in the U.S.andP;  According to the numbersDavidson saw, IBM has 27.1 per cent of the Canadian market, Compaq 21 percent -- and Apple a surprising 16 per cent.andM;Bowden says 3M is looking to make a giant leap forward in integrating in PCs,minis and mainframes.andP;  And part of the key to that, he says, is a consistentGUI across all platforms.andP;  The advanced VGA graphics standard and colormonitors are already standard equipment at 3M.andM;SOS OS/2andM;Our consultants all agreed that the trend towards graphic applications anduser interfaces, and, particularly &quot;windowing&quot; willhasten acceptance of OS/2and its Presentation Manager GUI component.andM;A lot of users are already attracted to Windows, the quasi-multi-taskingsystem for MS-DOS computers, Fabian notes.andP;  But the product is unreliable --a task in one window can corrupt a task in another window.andP;  This is mainlybecause MS-DOS is not really designed for multi-tasking.andP;  &quot;OS/2, on the otherhand, is a full multi-tasking system,&quot; he points out.andM;The other factor driving acceptance of OS/2, says 3M's Bowden, is thedesperate need to break the DOS 640K memory barrier to accommodate bigger andmore sophisticated applications.andM;&quot;We're going to need a far more robust operating system,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;3M islookign to migrate to OS/2 just as soon as it's proven itself as a stableenvironment.&quot;andM;More powerandM;Davidson says many companies are now standardizing on 386-based PCs.andM;&quot;Already you've got two versions of Lotus, for example, one for the haves --the 386 users -- and one for the have nots,&quot; says Davidson.andP;  &quot;And Microsoftjust announced a new version of Word that is an entirely new product thatonly works under Windows.&quot;andM;Furthermore, the newly announced Intel 486 technology, unlike  previousgenerations of Intel microprocessors, is backward compatible -- anythingdeveloped for the 486 should also run optimally on the 386.andM;Image inandM;The trend towards graphics in computing has one other facet -- the rise ofimage processing as a cost-effective way of eliminating paper and storingdocuments more efficiently.andM;More and more companies, Caston says, are using scanners and opticalcharacter reader (OCR) software to capture documents, store them on opticalmedia -- CD-ROM and WORM (write once, read many times) -- and move themaround networks.andM;ConclusionsandM;Fabian points out that Hypercard-like applications are beginning toproliferate.andP;  Hypercard is the Apple Macintosh program for organizinginformation and ideas, in non-linear, associative fashion.andP;  Hyperpad bringsthe same capabilities to the DOS world.andM;Bowden says service and security are increasingly pressing issues in theend-user community, as end-users come to depend more heavily on theircomputers and use them to store vital data.andM;But Bowden also points out that, despite the technology changes and thechanges in working habits and methods they bring, one aspect of end-usercomputing remains unchanged: &quot;What end users want in the final analysis isprompt, uncomplicated access to the information they need to do their jobs.andO;We shouldn't lose sight of that very basic requirement.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
