The Daiwa fund represents another wave of Japanese cash hitting U.S. securities markets. Last year Asian investors, mostly Japanese, bought $14.5 billion of U.S. stocks and bonds, according to Federal Reserve data. And just last week, Nomura Securities Co. and Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management, of Orinda, Calif., launched a $700 million fund that will invest Japanese clients' money in U.S. stocks.    &quot;The Japanese were a big presence in the first nine months of 1987, although they were liquidators in the final quarter,&quot; observed Steve Einhorn, an investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Japanese investors last year focused mainly on U.S. stocks, cutting back their usually big bond purchases. But the new Daiwa fund, officially known as New Bond Fund 88, suggests that Japanese investors have revived some enthusiasm for U.S. debt markets.    The biggest comparable launch of a pure U.S. fund to date is the $2 billion MFS Intermediate Income Trust, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, a specialist in closed-end funds. That fund, managed by Massachusetts Financial Services Co., was launched in early March; it invests in U.S. government and corporate bonds.    Daiwa officials said they were surprised at Japanese investors' clamoring for the new fund. Most of the fund's investors are Japanese institutions, though some individuals are participating, too. Subscriptions began Friday and were halted yesterday as the fund was oversubscribed. The Daiwa fund is about one-third to one-half invested at present, according to Chris Ohmura, an executive vice president.    To Japanese investors, the new fund's big lure is higher U.S. bond yields. While Japanese government and corporate bonds yield about 4.5%, U.S. Treasury bonds yield more than 9%. The Daiwa fund will seek even higher yields by buying U.S. corporate bonds, though it won't dabble in noninvestment-grade &quot;junk&quot; bonds, Mr. Ohmura said.    With the dollar's 50% plunge against the yen over the past three years, Japanese investors are skittish about the risk of further currency-translation losses. So the new Daiwa fund can use currency options and futures to hedge its dollar exposure. Mr. Ohmura said he believes the fund will begin with roughly half its dollar holdings protected against a further drop in the U.S. currency.    Mr. Ohmura added that New Bond Fund 88 may do some buying at this week's Treasury auction, most likely in shorter maturities. The Daiwa fund is designed to let investors cash out after five years, so it isn't likely to be a buyer of the bellwether 30-year U.S. bonds, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
