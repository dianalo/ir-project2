The Republican platform committee also heard two former rivalsto George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp, emphasize a needfor the Republicans to attract independent and cross-overDemocratic voters and to bring more members of minority groups intothe party.   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the party chairman, opened the committee'shearing with an attack on the ``bland and featureless'' documentthat the Democrats' platform committee approved last Saturday inDenver.   The Democrats ``are trying to hide their true policies,'' saidFahrenkopf. ``Their platform is truly a facade with no interiordrafted by politicians who have chosen to avoid the issues of theelection of 1988.'' He challenged Michael Dukakis and the Democrats``to meet us on the battlefield of ideas in 1988.''   Sen. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., one of the platform writers, said theonly way for Democrats to get elected is to ``adopt outrightRepublican policies of economic growth and freedom or hide theirliberal policies behind a facade of bogus consensus.''   As the election nears, he said, ``the disguise will come off andMichael Dukakis will be exposed for the narrow-minded, liberal wolfin sheep's cothing that he really is.''   Both Dole and Kemp said after testifying to the platformcommittee that Bush was closing in on Dukakis in polls because thepublic is taking a closer look at the Massachusetts governor.   ``For the last several weeks he hasn't had Jesse Jackson tobeat,'' said Dole. ``Now people are starting to focus on who isthis Dukakis and how did he get here. ... He's a true,Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy liberal.''   Kemp said Dukakis ``is not the center of the American politicalmainstream that he looked like when he was campaigning againstJesse Jackson. He is from the McGovern wing of the DemocraticParty.''   Kemp told reporters he does not expect to be picked by Bush as arunning mate, but said Dole might be.   ``I'm not after it because I don't think it's going to beoffered,'' said Kemp, adding that from ``all of the signals, all ofthe press reports coming out of the Bush campaign, it sounds to melike they're leaning to Bob Dole.''   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job, said, ``I don't thinkit's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning theelection, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'dwant to be majority leader if I had my choice.''   The Kansas senator, who was Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976,was majority leader until the Democrats regained control of theSenate in the 1986 elections.   Dole, in his testimony, urged the party to fashion a platformthat pays special attention to the needs of children, including newchild-care grants for states _ paid for by phasing out the childcare tax-credit for high income families.   Dole said the Democrats kept their platform short because ``theydon't have much to talk about. ... I mean, who wants to talk aboutraising your taxes and more regulation and more spending?''   Kemp said the party needs to expand its ranks and be more like``the party of Lincoln.''   ``The Democrats measure compassion by how many people are onwelfare. I think we ought to tell the American people we're goingto measure compassion by how few people need welfare,'' said Kemp.   The platform committee also heard Robert Vernon, an assistantpolice chief of Los Angeles, call for stiff measures against drugsand drug-related crime.   ``I truly believe we are approaching a civilization crisis _ aliteral civilization crisis,'' said Vernon. He called for a WorldWar II-like mobilization to fight drugs, including creation of anational drug czar and depriving drug users of driver's licensesand other social privileges.   A businessman, Barry Baszile, testified that drug dealers areentrepreneurs, too, and might turn to legal businesses if economicdevelopment funds were available in the inner cities.</TEXT></DOC>
