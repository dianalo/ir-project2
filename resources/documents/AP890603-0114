After intense debate at a Socialist congress in Bern, delegatesvoted 583 to 370 against taking any stand on a Nov. 26 nationalreferendum on the proposal to disband Switzerland's 625,000-memberarmy.   Socialist Party President Helmut Hubacher had called theproposal ``a rotten egg'' and urged the party to take a clear standagainst it.   The proposal has drawn a fierce reaction from the Socialists'three center-right partners in a governing alliance which is citedas a prime factor in Switzerland's political stability.   A leader of the conservative Swiss People's Party, ChristophBlocher, had said an anti-army decision by the Socialists shouldspell the end of the government coalition.   After the vote, however, Blocher said the Socialists shouldremain in the alliance.   The strongest reaction to the vote came from the Free RadicalDemocrats, Switzerland's largest party, which called for talksbetween the four parties on the Socialists' role in the government.Its official statement said the vote called into question theSocialists' commitment to Switzerland's ``armed neutrality.''   The third partner, the Christian Democrats, also criticized theSocialists. They said the Socialists had lost credibility indeciding to take no stand.   Saturday's special congress revealed deep divisions among theSocialists themselves. Right-wing members and trade union leadersoppose the disarmament plan, while young party members areparticularly important in a pacifist groundswell.   Even though delegates at the congress in the Swiss capitaldecided by a majority of 213 against making a recommendation onreferendum, a surprising majority of 641 to 259 said theypersonally backed the no-army proposal.   The anti-army proposal was put forward by socialists andreligious pacifists who collected 113,000 signatures, forcing thereferendum. The proposed amendment to the federal constitution says``Switzerland has no army'' and deletes all references to defenseneeds.   Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one in four Swissvoters might sympathize with the ``zero option.''   Protests have grown against low-flying combat planes and noisefrom militia target practice at the country's shooting ranges.   But most Swiss seem to oppose a farewell to arms in this countrywhere the military has a long tradition, even though the army hasnot fought a foreign war for five centuries.</TEXT></DOC>
