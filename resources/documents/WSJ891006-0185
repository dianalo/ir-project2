The cutbacks will take effect over the next year.    The company, part of Westland Group PLC, makes equipment for cockpits in military and civilian aircraft. &quot;They're winning orders, but orders aren't always profitable,&quot; said a spokesman for the parent company. &quot;Competition is intense and it's from all over the world.&quot;    Last summer, Westland Technology posted a 48% decline in operating profit for the six months ended March 31, to #2.6 million from #5 million in the comparable period a year earlier.    The 420 layoffs will come from a work force at Westland Technologies of 2,686. The company is negotiating terms with employees and has invited voluntary early retirements.    The company declined to say what product lines it plans to drop. Officials said Westland is still discussing the planned restructuring with major customers, which range from British Aerospace PLC to the U.S. Navy. In a statement, the company said only that it will &quot;concentrate its business in profitable areas of activity and a number of product lines are being discontinued.&quot;    Aerospace concerns and makers of cockpit components have come under intense pressure as the major Western governments have cut back their military budgets. Partly as a result of this, aerospace concerns are fighting for contracts in the developing world and among civilian customers. As a result, profit margins have begun to shrivel.    According to Westland, &quot;it is essential to reduce wherever possible all operating costs.&quot;    Other Westland units have had problems recently as well. Westland Helicopter, Britain's sole helicopter producer, earlier this year posted declining profits, partly because it fell behind schedule in the delivery of helicopters being produced for the government of India. </TEXT></DOC>
