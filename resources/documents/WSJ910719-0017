Secretary of State James Baker said the two nations agreedthat a United Nations observer at the conference would takenotes and communicate with the participants and also reportto the U.N. secretary-general. The issue has been a stickingpoint with the potential participants in a peace conference.Israel previously has rejected any U.N. involvement.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Baker told reporters in Damascus &quot;I am pleased toreport that Syria has agreed to the proposal that we havemade, including coming to a peace conference. I think thatthis is an extraordinarily important and positive step.&quot;   Israel has yet to agree to the U.S. proposal, and as Mr.Baker continues to peel away procedural obstacles to aMideast peace conference, he is exposing some deep Israelibeliefs to the spotlight.   In advance of Mr. Baker's visit to Israel Sunday, IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has gone mum on the peaceprocess, and has forbidden other government ministers fromcommenting on what Mr. Baker and President Bush call Syria'sbreakthrough acceptance of U.S. terms.   But this silence doesn't hide the problem Israel faces.Syrian President Hafez Assad, by seeming to embrace the causeof Mideast peace, has given a sudden measure of legitimacy tohis demand that Israel return the Golan Heights. That's badnews for Israel, which has never before faced a Syria thatshowed even a pretense of wanting peace. It is especiallytroublesome for Israel because most Israelis are dead-setagainst giving back the Golan, even in exchange for a peaceagreement.   This commitment to retaining the strategic slopes abovethe Sea of Galilee unites Israelis, in contrast to the bitterschism over what to do with the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip. In a poll taken in late June, before Mr. Assad'srecent letter to Mr. Bush accepting the U.S. terms, only 7%of Israeli respondents favored giving back the Golan inexchange for &quot;true peace&quot; with Syria. Israel captured theGolan from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War.   When the same question is asked about the West Bank andGaza Strip, roughly half of Israelis usually say they favortrading land for peace, says pollster Hanoch Smith of theSmith Research Center.   Public support for keeping the Golan translates into arare political consensus, as well. It was the Labor Party,not Mr. Shamir's ruling Likud party, that presided over theeffective annexation of the Golan Heights 11 years ago.Labor-led governments were also responsible for planning andpromoting Jewish settlements on the Golan, where some 10,000Jews now reside. This spring, Labor leader Yitzhak Rabin saidIsrael would be better off not making peace with Syria at allif it meant returning the Golan.   &quot;The Golan is needed for our security,&quot; says reserve Brig.Gen. Ephraim Sneh, a Labor Party dove and director general ofthe Golda Meir Association.   The Golan has two things that Israelis don't want to partwith: water and mountains. The heights are the main watershedfor the Jordan River, which irrigates thousands of acres ofIsraeli and Jordanian crops. Its streams also provide some25% of the water supply to the Sea of Galilee, Israel's mainreservoir. One of the main conflicts that led to the Six DayWar was Syria's attempt to shunt the Golan's water into acanal and away from Israel.   Militarily, the Golan serves Israel as a buffer zoneagainst possible Syrian aggression and a monitoring stationfor early warning. The hilly terrain and excellent listeningposts are believed to afford Israel roughly 24 hours ofpreparation time against a Syrian attack, 24 hours Israel'sreserve army wouldn't have if it had to defend against Syrianbases already lodged on the Golan. As it is now, Israelimilitary officials say, Syria keeps 90% of its army along the30-mile road between the Golan and Damascus.   &quot;We have to separate myths from hard facts,&quot; says Gen.Sneh. &quot;As far as national security is concerned, the GazaStrip and West Bank are a liability. But the Golan isessential.&quot;   Mr. Baker stressed last night that the negotiations wouldseek a &quot;comprehensive settlement,&quot; and he specificallyreiterated that &quot;we have not recognized the annexation of theGolan by Israel.&quot;   There are other problem areas. Mr. Baker said Syria agreedthat the one-time conference could be reconvened only if allof the participants agreed. This would, in effect, give vetopower to Israel, which opposes the idea of a continuingconference. By agreeing to the plan, Syria seems to beputting its confidence in Washington to be the driving forcebehind the negotiations.   Nevertheless, the agreement by Syria clearly puts intensepressure on Israel. &quot;It gives us something to work with, andwe are going to try to build on it throughout this trip,&quot; Mr.Baker said.   ---                   Whither the Heights                                                                                                          In order to have true peace with Syria and security forIsrael, are you ready to make a territorial compromise on theGolan Heights?
