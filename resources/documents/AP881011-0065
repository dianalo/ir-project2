President Chadli Bendjedid, speaking to the nation Monday night,also hinted he may not run for another term.   His address came hours after troops fired machine guns into acrowd of more than 10,000 in the Algiers district of Bab-el-Oued.Witnesses estimated that 25 to 30 people were killed. Dozens ofothers were wounded, some seriously.   One witness said he saw many bodies. ``The soldiers were pilingthem into trucks, one body on top of another,'' he said oncondition of anonymity.   The government has provided no casualty figures, but reliablereports from police, hospitals and other sources indicate that asmany as 300 have died in the week of unrest. The governmentdeclared a state of emergency Thursday and authorized troops tofire on demonstrators if necessary to disperse them.   Monday's demonstration was to be a peaceful protest marchorganized by the Islamic fundamentalist Movement for AlgerianRenewal, which has demanded the government resign today. It was notimmediately clear how the violence began.   The army remained in control of sensitive points in the capitalof Algiers today, including the National Assembly, the mainnewspaper El Moudjahid and critical road junctions.   But they remained quiet, and helicopters stopped low-leveloverflights. Some shops reopened as many workers went back to theirjobs.   Under the government's austerity program, prices of manyformerly subsidized food staples have risen 40 percent sinceJanuary. A combination of rapidly rising prices and shortages haveled to widespread disgruntlement.   The unrest began about two weeks ago with a series of strikesdemanding higher wages to keep up with inflation.   The national news agency and state-controlled newspapers printedthe president's speech and praised his ``realism and politicalcourage.''   The speech, which in fact contained little new, carried thesuggestion he might not seek a third five-year term at the congressof the governing National Liberation Front party in December.   Bendjedid promised far-reaching political reforms to gohand-in-hand with previously announced economic reform measures,but he gave no details.   The Islamic fundamentalists who struggled to take control of therevolt issued no statements today. However, they are likely toreappear, particularly during funerals for demonstrators shot downby the army Monday in Bab-el-Oued.   The president said on national radioo and television Mondaynight he was ``bitterly sorry for the material and human losses''in the street violence.   ``My duty as the person with supreme responsibility for thiscountry was to make the decisions necessary to protect the nation,whatever the circumstances, and whatever the difficulties,'' hesaid. ``We have the courage to recognize our mistakes and torestore the situation. I would like you to help me.''   It had been widely expected that the congress of the governingNational Liberation Front would amend the constitution to permithim to be nominated for a third term. As the sole candidate, hiselection would be a certainty.   In his speech, he said he ``swore to respect the popular willand to facilitate the rise of young people to the leadership.'' Butthese changes must take place calmly, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
