<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1252 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report is a detailed examination of energy conservation measuresand renewable energy technology appropriate to be used at a school onan island in British Columbia. An energy audit was conducted to examinethe current state of the building systems, and this report describesthe present situation, recommended changes, and estimated costs withrespect to insulation, windows, thermostats, airtightness, ventilation,water heating, power generation, and solar gains. Proposed improvementsare outlined in the areas of energy conservation (additional insulation,double glazing, modified thermostat operation and so on), increasingefficiency of the diesel generating system (including use of waste heatto heat the building floor), and renewable energy sources. The latterpossibilities include solar heating and wind power. Economic analysisfor the various options is presented and it is shown that average fuelexpenditure would be reduced from about $9,500/y to $2,800-4,220/y ifall the systems described in the report (except the windmill) are implemented.This implies a 71% to 56% reduction, and a payback period of 6.65 to8.45 years, depending on weather and staff conservation habits. 3 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
