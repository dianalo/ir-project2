As the government completes it quarterly financing with the sale of $22 billion of three-year and 10-year notes today and tomorrow, &quot;My hunch is the Fed will tighten,&quot; said Maury Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. He predicted the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, soon will rise to 8% from less than 7 7/8% recently as the Fed attempts to reduce pressure for a higher rate of inflation.    &quot;When it happens, it will be small but significant,&quot; said Mr. Harris. &quot;That's been the story of the Fed all year long -- it shows a willingness to tighten (credit) in anticipation of inflation.&quot; Fed funds, which influence other short-term rates, are about one percentage point above their level a year ago.    While the dollar's recent gains helped buoy the bond market, the dollar has been helped by the rise in short-term rates. Yesterday, for instance, while prices of some short-term notes edged lower, prices of some actively traded long-term government issues rose nearly 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    &quot;Were it not for the dollar rally, the strength of the economy would be giving us higher bond yields,&quot; said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. But Mr. Hale still expects long-term government yields to rise to 9 3/4% by year's end from 9.11%.    &quot;The pressure for higher bond yields hasn't gone away,&quot; he added. &quot;Since nothing is being done to reduce the budget deficit in a full employment economy, higher yields are inevitable. Based on George Bush's campaign promises, I'd buy day care centers, not bonds,&quot; Mr. Hale said, referring to the vice president's promise to give additional tax credits for child day care.    Thomas Barry, a senior executive vice president at George D. Bjurman andamp; Associates, says his firm's $300 million fixed-income portfolio is &quot;fully invested&quot; in short to intermediate securities and that he probably won't be among the buyers at either government auction this week.    But as do many other U.S. money managers, he says the strength of the dollar recently and the current gap between U.S. and foreign bond yields could prompt Japanese and some European investors to increase their U.S. debt holdings at the auctions this week.    Cecilia Mead, a portfolio manager at Harbor Capital Management Co. in Boston, says the $600 million fixed-income portfolio is essentially fully invested and positioned relatively short with an average maturity of about three years. &quot;Basically, the thought here is we're going to have higher rates by the end of the year,&quot; she says. &quot;We're being cautious.&quot;    Robert Wasilewski, a portfolio manager at ASB Capital Management in Washington, says no decision has been made about his firm's involvement in the two refunding auctions. But Mr. Wasilewski, whose firm runs $2.5 billion of fixed-income assets, says the three-year portion, which currently yields 8.62% in when-issued trading, &quot;looks fairly interesting no matter what you think inflation is, even for a total rate of return account.&quot;    Foreign Bonds   Prices of British, Canadian and Japanese government bonds declined as the Bank of England pushed up short-term interest rates and signaled the potential for rate increases elsewhere in Europe.    British government bonds tumbled as much as 5/8 point after credit-tightening by the Bank of England prompted commercial banks to raise their base lending rates half a percentage point to 11%. The move to higher rates was aimed at restraining pressures on inflation, which is expected to climb to a 5% annual rate this month and exceed 6% by the end of the year.    The rise in base rates was the seventh half-point increase since June, when they were 7.5%. The latest move &quot;makes one think there is some bad news just around the corner,&quot; said Ian Harwood, a senior economist at Warburg Securities. &quot;I don't think this is the top.&quot;    The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 1/4 point to 116 3/32 to yield 9.65%.    A strengthening dollar helped drive Japanese government bond prices lower in quiet trading. The benchmark 5% No. 105 bonds due 1997 fell 0.51 point from Friday to 99.71. The yield rose 0.51 point from Friday to 5.045%. Canadian issues also slumped. The government 9 1/2% bonds due 1998 fell 1/4 point to 96 3/4. The yield rose to 10.02% from 9.98%.    In Frankfurt, the West German government's 6 1/2% bonds due 1998 rose 0.05 point to 98.30 bid. The yield fell to 6.74% from 6.75% Friday.    Treasury Securities   In yesterday's activity, the Treasury's latest 30-year bond rose to 100 1/8 from 99 30/32. The yield eased to 9.11% from 9.13% Friday. The government's 10-year notes rose to 99 10/32 from 99 9/32. The yield fell to 9.10% from 9.11%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 1.40 points to 1226.92. The index ranged between 1221.66 and 1227.90.    Among short-term interest rates, the average discount yield on new three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday was 6.94%. On six-month bills, the average discount yield was 7.26%. The yields were up from the previous auction, when the average rates on three-month and six-month bills were 6.89% and 7.15%, respectively.    Here are details of the auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                  13-Week          26-Week   Applications ........... $24,846,675,000  $23,648,995,000   Accepted bids ........... $6,813,545,000   $6,805,230,000   Accepted at low price .............. 94%               3%   Accepted noncompet'ly ... $1,086,890,000   $1,134,600,000   Average price (Rate) ..... 98.246(6.94%)    96.330(7.26%)   High price (Rate) ........ 98.251(6.92%)    96.330(7.26%)   Low price (Rate) ......... 98.246(6.94%)    96.325(7.27%)   Coupon equivalent ................ 7.16%            7.64%   Both issues are dated Aug. 11. The 13-week bills mature Nov. 10, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 9, 1989.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bond prices finished with gains of about 1/8 point. New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 rose to 91 3/8 from 91 1/4. The yield was 7.96%.   Anticipation of the preliminary pricing today of the week's two largest deals on the weekly tax-exempt calendar also dulled activity yesterday, traders said. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets are considering pricing $3.2 billion of California revenue anticipation notes, and a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. group may unveil $450 million of New York City general obligation securities.   Traders' estimates of what the California notes would yield on reoffering range from 6.05% to as much as 6.10%. The notes mature June 30, 1989. There are few actively traded notes in the secondary market comparable with the coming California issue.   Los Angeles County's 11-month top-rated notes, which carry a 5.60% coupon, were bid to yield around 6.16% late Monday afternoon. They were offered at around 6.10%.   New York City's pending issue of $450 million of general obligation bonds was rated single-A by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P. Unofficial price talk circulating yesterday among traders has the issue yielding from 5.80% in 1989 to about 8.07% in 2011-2018 for 8% serial securities priced at 99 1/4.   Corporate Issues   Prices finished the day little changed to up 1/8 point in light trading.   No new issues came to market, although one extendible note originally sold in 1985 was remarketed with a new rate and a new maturity.   Dow Chemical Co.'s $115.6 million of one-year 8.43% extendible notes were priced at 99.887 to yield 8.55%, a spread of 50 basis points above the rate of the Treasury one-year note. As with other extendibles, the issuer may call the notes in one year or the buyer may put the notes back to the company at par.   The notes have a final maturity of Aug. 15, 2015.   The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Mortgage-Backed Issues   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues ended slightly higher after very light trading.   August Ginnie Mae 9% securities were quoted at 94 1/8, up 2/32, and 10% securities were quoted at 99 30/32, also up 2/32.   The 10% securities were yielding 10.14% to a 12-year average life, as the yield spread to the when-issued 10-year Treasury note held at 105 basis points.   Activity in derivative markets was light, with no new issues priced. Traders said a relatively flat yield curve makes structuring new real estate mortgage conduits, or Remics, difficult.</TEXT></DOC>
