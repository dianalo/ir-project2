Students and workers paraded in front of the provincialgovernment headquarters for a seventh day to denounce thegovernment on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the Kwangjuuprising, which left nearly 200 people dead.   The protesters shouted slogans claiming police killed a radicalstudent earlier this month. Many office workers joined in theprotest.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo,'' hundreds of protesters chanted as theymarched with red, blue and yellow flags and placards withanti-government slogans.   Riot police armed with shields and truncheons surroundedgovernment buildings. Violent clashes between protesters and policein the square on Tuesday night left about 60 people injured. Noviolence was reported today.   Many Kwangju citizens said they believe the radical student whowas killed earlier this month was tortued to death by the police.There is no doubt ``that he was murdered,'' a taxi driver said attoday's protest.   In Seoul, 2,000 college radical students staged peacefulprotests at three colleges today to mark the Kwangju uprising andcall for Roh's downfall. Riot police blocked about 500 studentsfrom marching out of Yonsei University, but there was no fighting.   Police are on top alert nationwide because of protests expectedThursday to mark the Kwangju anniversay that began May 18, 1980. Atleast 192 people were killed in the nine-day uprising, which wassuppressed by government troops.   Dissident groups are demanding Roh, who was a senior general atthe time, and other top officials be punished for the suppressionof the uprising. The government says troops were sent in as a lastresort to end a violent uprising.   Chun Doo-hwan, a senior general at the time of the uprising,took power as president a few months later with the aid of Roh andother officers. He imposed a tough authoritarian rule during hisseven-year term.   Anti-government sentiment in Kwangju was inflamed by thediscovery May 10 of the body of the radical student, Lee Chol-kyu,in a reservoir near the city. ``Punish Roh Tae-woo who killed LeeChol-kyu,'' protesters chanted today.   Government officials say Lee appears to have fallen into thereservoir and drowned after fleeing from police who stopped him ata checkpoint. Officials deny police killed Lee and say an autopsyproves he drowned in the reservoir.   Police had been hunting for Lee for anti-government activities,including writing articles praising communist North Korea.   South Korea has experienced a wave of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes in recent months.   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for theoverthrow of Roh, but they lack support because of their violenttactics and extremist views.</TEXT></DOC>
