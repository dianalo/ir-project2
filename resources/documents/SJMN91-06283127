Gimpy Sid Bream will be a focalpoint at the start because of his reluctant move from Pittsburgh as a freeagent after last season and his invaluable guidance for the Braves thisseason. But Bream will give way for the three games after tonight to rookieBrian Hunter (50 RBIs in only 271 at-bats), who bats against left-handers andcame through with big second-half hits. Pittsburgh also platoons with aveteran against left-handers (Gary Redus, .143 vs. Atlanta in 1991) and arookie against right-handers (Orlando Merced, .333 vs. Atlanta). Edge: Even.;   SECOND BASE -- Pittsburgh's Jose Lind had a big playoff homer last fall, andhe has been steady if not spectacular this season. Atlanta's Jeff Treadway hit.320 in 306 at-bats this season, and he was 9 for 20 against the Pirates. ButTreadway has a sore wrist that will require winter surgery, so light-hittingMark Lemke starts instead. Edge: Pirates.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  N.L. POSITION-BY-POSITION MATCHUPS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     SHORTSTOP -- Jay Bell hit only .178 against Atlanta this season, but heotherwise emerged for Pittsburgh as much more than the game's best sacrificebunter. Bell's 1990 backup, Rafael Belliard, went to Atlanta over the winterand is basically a Jose Uribe who solidifies the defense but is an easy out.Edge: Pirates.;   THIRD BASE -- This series will showcase the MVP favorites,including Atlanta's Terry Pendleton. He played third with his usual aplomb andcame out of nowhere with his offense, winning the batting title with a .319average. His leadership can't be overlooked, either. Pittsburgh acquiredformer Stanford standout Steve Buechele from Texas in the second half, and noone has a better glove at third. No. 6-hitting Buechele will force the Bravesto pitch to No. 5 hitter Barry Bonds, which is something the Braves didn'thave to worry about in the regular season. Edge: Braves.;   CATCHER --Atlanta's Greg Olson made the All-Star team in 1990 and faded in the secondhalf; this season, he took over around midseason, when Mike Heath was injured,and went on to become one of the team's top clutch hitters. Pittsburgh stillplatoons Mike LaValliere against right-handed pitchers and Don Slaught againstleft-handers, with success. Edge: Braves.;   LEFT FIELD -- Bonds forPittsburgh. Lonnie Smith for Atlanta. Edge: Pirates.;   CENTER FIELD --Atlanta's Ron Gant was in the 30-30 club for the second consecutive season,finishing with 32 homers, 34 steals and 105 RBIs. Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slykeis the league's best at the position, and he hit .265 with 17 homers and 83RBIs. Edge: Braves.;   RIGHT FIELD -- Atlanta's David Justice probably wouldbe in the MVP picture had he not been knocked out for two months in midseasonwith a back ailment. He still finished with a .275 average, 21 homers and 87RBIs. Justice is a better fielder than Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla (.302, 18homers, 100 RBIs), but everyone in baseball is salivating over the Pirates'slugger, who becomes a free agent when his season ends. Edge: Even.;  STARTING PITCHING -- Tonight's opener could be a matchup of back-to-back CyYoung Award winners, with Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek the 1990 recipient andAtlanta's Tom Glavine the leading candidate this year. Drabek was better thanGlavine in the second half and is hard to beat at Three Rivers Stadium;Glavine was the All-Star starter and should be accustomed to the commotion.Both staffs have three starters capable of dominating hitters (also Zane Smithand John Smiley for Pittsburgh, and Steve Avery and John Smoltz for Atlanta).Atlanta has the edge with the fourth starter: Charlie Leibrandt is in theplayoffs for his third team, and his six-game winning streak in the pennantrace was a major factor; Pittsburgh's Randy Tomlin had a 2.98 ERA in 27 startsbut was 8-7. Edge: Braves.;   RELIEF PITCHING -- Neither bullpen has a LeeSmith-type hammer, although late-season pickup Alejandro Pena has convertedhis last 11 save opportunities for the Braves. Pittsburgh's bullpen bycommittee, featuring Stan Belinda, Bill Landrum and Roger Mason, somehow getsit done. Edge: Even.;   MANAGERS -- Atlanta's Bobby Cox will win thepostseason award, not only for the team's mere presence in the playoffs butfor how he got the Braves through the midseason absences of Justice and Breamas well as the late-season loss of Otis Nixon to a failed drug test. On theother hand, Jim Leyland had to deal with the Bonds flap in spring training andhas been able to keep the Pirates focused amid constant economic issues. WithWhitey Herzog out of the league, Leyland probably is the best of today's N.L.managers. Edge: Pirates.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  -- Mark Newman  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911009  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  794  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 9, 199100283127,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
