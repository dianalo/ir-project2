Not necessarily, some experts say.   ``The consumer increasingly is losing out,'' contends Robert K.Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,newsletter that tracks bank interest rates. ``It seems to be adifferent ballgame in 1988.''   Heady says banks have been slower than usual this year inraising their CD and deposit rates to keep pace with increases inlending rates like the prime, which is used to calculate a widerange of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans.   As an example, he uses the period between May 11, the first timebanks raised the prime this year, and Aug. 10, the day before thelatest half-percentage-point increase lifted the key lending rateto a three-year high of 10 percent.   During the May 11-Aug. 10 period, the prime rose a fullpercentage point, to 9.5 percent from 8.5 percent.   Six-month CD yields rose on average a half percentage point, to7.42 percent from 6.92 percent, while 1-year CDs rose about thesame amount, to 7.72 percent from 7.23 percent.   The 2{-year CD average rose 0.39 point to 8.04 percent from 7.65percent, and 5-year CDs increased an even smaller 0.28 point to8.40 percent from 8.12 percent.   Yields on money market accounts, which averaged 5.69 percent inMay, rose to around 5.83 percent, Heady says.   Banks and most economist say the current spread is justified formany reasons.   To start with, there is the cost of federal deposit insuranceand reserve requirements with which banks have to contend. Andbanks have to protect themselves from possible loan defaults.   Besides, banks and economists say, yields on bank products likeCDs often are set by the prevailing rates in the credit markets.The spread between long- and short-term rates there has narrowed inrecent months.   ``You have to take into account the whole structure of interestrates,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for ManufacturersHanover Trust Co. ``The actual cost of money to any bank depends onfunding strategy over the past few weeks and few months.   ``It's not just simply the latest CD rate ... subtracted by theprime rate.''   Moves in the prime rate typically lag changes of almost allmarket-related interest rates.   Still, Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc., believes ``there's a little greed involved'' whenit comes to some increases in banks' lending rates, vs. their costof funds.   But ``there's no conspiracy here,'' he adds. ``There's no evilmotivation involved. It's just the way the market works.   ``If you see an opportunity to make a little money, then you'lldo it.''</TEXT></DOC>
