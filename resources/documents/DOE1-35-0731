As a result we came tothe following conclusions: 1. The sensitivity was well evaluated in intraarterialdigital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) of breast. 2. IA-DSA could diagnosedifficult cases like cancer which had undergone augmentation mammoplasty,or like Paget's disease and others. 3. DSA was a safe examination method.4. The sensitivity of IA-DSA of breast cancer is superior to intravenousdigital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA).</TEXT></DOC>
