The five-week racketeering and fraud trial of five former officials of Princeton/Newport Limited Partnership and a former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has been closely watched on Wall Street. It marks the first time that officials of a securities firm have been tried for alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO. The law carries heavy sentences and asset forfeitures upon conviction; it also allows for pretrial restraint of defendants' assets.    If the government wins this case, the Justice Department, which must approve RICO charges against defendants, is likely to give prosecutors the go-ahead to bring more such cases. A loss for the government could result in fewer securities-related RICO cases.    The case may have other ramifications as well. If a jury succeeds in convicting former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, who is one of the defendants, prosecutors are understood to be hopeful that Mr. Newberg will cooperate against his former boss, Michael Milken, in exchange for a more lenient sentence.    Mr. Newberg was charged in March along with Mr. Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond operations, in a separate indictment. Both were accused of racketeering, securities fraud, tax fraud and other crimes. Some of Mr. Milken's alleged crimes involved trading with Princeton/Newport.    In the current case, the government has accused the six defendants of conspiring to create illegitimate tax losses through a series of prearranged securities transactions. In these deals, Princeton/Newport allegedly sold securities at a loss and then repurchased them by prior agreement at the same or slightly higher prices. Such a practice is known as stock parking.    In his closing argument, Neil Cartusciello, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the defendants &quot;joined together in a scheme that they knew was wrong.&quot; At Princeton/Newport, Mr. Cartusciello said, the &quot;arrogance is an arrogance that everything is so complicated and so clever that no one will be able to piece it together.&quot;    Mr. Cartusciello said that James Sutton Regan, the managing general partner of Princeton/Newport and a defendant in the case, wasn't being truthful when he testified that his firm never had an agreement to park securities at other securities firms, including Drexel, and repurchase them at a set price.    Princeton/Newport tried to conceal the prearranged trades even from its own lawyers and accountants by artificially changing prices of securities and altering its records, Mr. Cartusciello added.    In his closing, Theodore Wells, an attorney for Mr. Regan, said his client and the other Princeton/Newport officials never cheated the government out of taxes and that none of the defendants had derived any financial benefits from the trades.    &quot;Would it be arrogant to commit a crime where you got no money?&quot; Mr. Wells asked jurors. &quot;That wouldn't be arrogant; that would be insane,&quot; he said.    Mr. Wells said Mr. Regan believed the trades &quot;were legal then and he still thinks they're legal now.&quot; Citing the tape recordings of phone calls that the government has relied on to present the bulk of its case, Mr. Wells said that most of Princeton/Newport's phone calls were recorded by the firm itself. &quot;Why would you do criminal acts on a taped phone?&quot; Mr. Wells asked jurors.    Mr. Wells said that the government hadn't proved anything against his client. &quot;This is a weak case,&quot; he said, adding that, under the circumstances, the government owes Mr. Regan an apology for putting him on trial. </TEXT></DOC>
