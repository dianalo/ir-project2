(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Varma, C.M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The two-band model including intra-atomic repulsion on Cu andnear-neighbor Cu-O repulsion for the high-temperaturesuperconductors is supported by a variety of experiments andtheoretical calculations as the minimum necessary.andP;  The specificmechanism for high T(sub.c) through charge-transfer resonances wasproposed because the known alternative mechanisms - phonons andmagnetic excitations - were believed unlikely.andP;  The case forcharge-transfer-resonance-induced high T(sub.c) has, however, notbeen proven.andP;  Equally important, the various anomalies in themetallic state are not yet understood.andP;  However, calculations onthe model do show a charge-transfer-gap insulating state which isantiferromagnetic at and near 1/2 filling, a metallic state forintermediate filling with effective particle-particle attraction,and a charge-transfer instability beyond a certain filling.andO;(Reprinted by permission of the publisher.)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ModelingSuperconductive DevicesTemperatureParticle PhysicsScientific Research.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Schematic one-particle partial spectral weight on Cu and O atoms.andO;(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
