Employers haveboth a right and an obligation to screen workers.andP;  There's nothing to worryabout as long as your screening doesn't violate private laws.andP;  Moreover, theword will get out that your organization checks up on applicants andemployees--and the bad apples will stay way.andM;As a matter of policy, document all breaches of data security, including thetime, date, location, type of information involved and the alleged suspect(if any).andP;  If there's a criminal prosecution, this information will bevaluable to the prosecutor.andP;  It will also help your company's attorneys ifthey opt to file a civil suit.andM;You may decide to fire an employee whom you suspect of leaking sensitiveinformation to a competitor.andP;  Having documented proof of the employee'sviolation of company rules will certainly help you if he or she sues you forwrongful discharge.andM;Next time, I'll finish up this series on protecting data from competitors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
