Redman, the State Department spokesman. ``The Sovietunderstanding is the same as ours, which is that the INF treatybans all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched cruise and ballisticmissiles in the INF range regardless of the type of weapon it mightbe carrying.''   Redman said the joint conclusion would have no impact on theU.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, a program known popularly as``Star Wars'' that seeks to develop a space-based shield againstSoviet ballistic missiles with futuristic technology.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accepted the U.S.position in a letter delivered Friday night by Soviet AmbassadorYuri Dubinin to Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway,another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidSunday.   The concession seems to remove concerns that had been raised bythe Senate Armed Services Committee about weaponry using exotictechnologies such as lasers, plasma or ion beams.   Although the panel has endorsed the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., lastThursday described the futuristic weapons issue as a possible``hole in the treaty'' that had to be filled before he would bringthe pact to a vote of the full Senate.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz had raised the issue withShevardnadze on Thursday while they were in Geneva for the signingof an agreement with Pakistan and Afghanistan for the withdrawal ofSoviet forces from Afghanistan and a return of millions of Afghanrefugees to the country after more than eight years of civil war.   Shultz is scheduled to leave Tuesday for Moscow for talks withShevardnadze on a more elaborate treaty to sharply reduce U.S. andSoviet strategic nuclear weapons and to make preparations forPresident Reagan's visit to Moscow for a summit meeting with SovietGeneral Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev on May 29-June 2.   Shevardnadze's letter appears to represent an effort by Moscowto dispel congressional suspicions about Soviet intentions tocooperate with the United States in reducing nuclear weapons.   The Reagan administration has pushed for a Senate ratificationvote on the INF treaty before the summit, but the Armed Servicespanel was planning to issue another report on the futuristicweapons issue and Byrd said no floor action was likely before thatreported was completed.   ``I'm not driven by a calendar deadline,'' he said. ``I wantfirst, last and always to have a good treaty.''   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and former ArmsControl and Disarmament Agency Director Kenneth Adelman had said inletters released Thursday that they didn't believe the INF treatybanned futuristic weapons.   However, other administration officials including chief treatynegotiator Maynard Glitman have said the Soviet Union understoodthat the pact bars the possession or flight testing of allmedium-range weapons no matter how they are armed or operate.   Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators, and bothparties say the treaty likely will be supported by 88 to 90senators.</TEXT></DOC>
