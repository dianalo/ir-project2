A bipartisan draft document, given out to senators and obtainedby The Associated Press, compares the latest House and Senateproposals on outside income.   Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches,appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise that wouldboost congressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000.   Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria wouldcontinue if the pay raise is defeated because members don't want tosuffer a loss of income. Rank-and-file House members currently canretain $26,850 and Senate members $35,800 in honoraria.   The Senate plan includes a contingency that would permitretention of some honoraria if the raise is eventually scaled back.The pay plan now before Congress can only be defeated if both housesreject it. The Senate is virtually certain to turn the raise down,but the question of whether the House will vote on it depends on asurvey of members' intentions ordered by Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.   Under the honoraria proposals, both houses would permit such feesto be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The Senate plan wouldlimit the donation to $2,000 per appearance and require members tolist on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and therecipient of the donation.   The House and Senate plans would allow groups that invite membersto an event to continue paying for travel. The Senate would directits ethics committee to issue rules and regulations definingacceptable limits.   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., has told reportersthere would likely be a time restriction on House members' travel,with exceptions made for multi-day events.   The House draft would prohibit members from receiving any pensionbenefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The Senateplan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of thedonations to a member's personal use.   The House plan would limit all outside earned income to 15percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent.   The House also would end a provision in federal law that hasallowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $39million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use.The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving Housemembers one chance to retire with the money.   The Senate already has a rule prohibiting such conversion.   The House proposal would incorporate restrictions on members thatalready exist under Senate rules.   The restrictions include a ban on affiliating with businessentities for compensation, a prohibition on practicing a professionexcept part-time teaching, and a ban on serving as an officer orboard member on a publicly held or regulated corporation.   Wright and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,have promised that honoraria packages will be taken up immediatelyif the pay raise becomes law next Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
