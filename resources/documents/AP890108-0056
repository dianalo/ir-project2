(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The brother of the longest-held Americanhostage in Lebanon is spearheading a drive he hopes will direct200,000 letters to the White House by George Bush's inaugurationJan. 20.   ``The State Department has told us they have no mandate on thisissue. They think the people don't care,'' said John Anderson, anOcala resident whose brother Terry was kidnapped in Beirut almostfour years ago. ``We're out to show them the people do still care.''   Anderson said he thinks Bush will be more responsive to hispleadings than President Reagan, but he doesn't plan to take thatattitude for granted.   ``Our effort is to be sure he keeps (the hostages) in mind, tomake it one of his first concerns.''   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. Eight otherAmericans taken hostage since then are still being held captive.   His brother said he disagrees with those who speculate thatattention only makes the hostages more valuable to their kidnappers.   ``Virtually every hostage who has been released has madestatements that it was because of efforts to keep their names in thenews,'' he said. ``If the terrorists thought nobody cared, they'djust kill them. This is most definitely an effort to keep them aliveas well as to get them freed.''   John Anderson said he and his family are not asking thegovernment to deal with the terrorists, just open a dialogue andrelease Iranian assets frozen in this country.   ``Would it hurt to simply open the lines of communications?'' hesaid. ``We're not asking them to trade Terry for rifles andmissiles. Let's just give them what is theirs and talk to them.''</TEXT><TEXT>   John Anderson's address: ``Free The Hostages,'' P.O. Box 6692,Ocala, Fla. 32678.</TEXT></DOC>
