It has provided a place to meet and gossip, people to love or to hate, ball-point pens and expense-account lunches, bowling leagues and United Way drives, Christmas parties and hats emblazoned with corporate logos, cheerleading with catchphrases (&quot;the Hewlett-Packard Way&quot;) and a metaphorical &quot;family&quot; usually headed by kindly but authoritarian father figures. In recent years it has even provided a corporate &quot;culture.&quot; Those who have gone the route usually had well-attended funerals.    But imagine a company town a decade hence:    To 1980s sensibilities, many of Mega Corp.'s employees seem unusually sober-sided. One reason is that their jobs are only as secure as their next quarterly performance review. Still, they are more secure than the temporary and part-time workers the company hires as needed -- and who make up nearly a quarter of the work force. Once-mighty Mega Corp. has shrunk to a third of its peak size in the late 1970s. A great deal of its engineering, data processing and advertising are done by a satellite system of smaller concerns nearby.    Below the top ranks of management, Mega Corp. veterans wistfully recall the good old days of paternalism, with company-underwritten medical insurance, gyms, M.B.A. degrees and softball teams. The frills and most of the fringes have vanished. Employees pay a large part of their health-care costs. Employees of smaller companies pay all of their medical insurance, while some individual Mega Corp. contractors or free-lances do without.    All of this is evolving today in corporate America. One survey shows that three-quarters of the nation's employers may be planning managerial and administrative cuts on top of their recent wrenching cutbacks. Driven by the need to reduce costs and meet foreign competition to survive, employers are reshaping the corporation. In the process, they are reshaping much of American life.    A two-tier work force is taking shape: &quot;Inside&quot; employees still enjoy benefits, perquisites and a degree of job security. New &quot;outside&quot; workers have an uncertain tenure.    &quot;I call it a core and peripheral employment system,&quot; says Eli Ginzberg, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University. Whatever it is called, the system already is chilling the long-standing intimacy between many employers and their workers. It is thrusting tens of thousands of managers, some eagerly and some reluctantly, into the strange new world of self-employment and entrepreneurship. It is changing the economy from one dominated by large corporations into one in which small firms play a bigger and bigger role.    Decades of economic growth almost completely unhindered by outside competition allowed corporate work forces to bloat. &quot;For the better part of 40 years, American industry went on the assumption that the more control it had over people and business, the better,&quot; says Prof. Ginzberg. &quot;There was a tremendous tendency to do as much as possible for yourself.&quot;    Richard A. Jacobs, a senior vice president at the consulting firm of A.T. Kearney Inc., estimates that during the 1970s, companies added white-collar workers at a rate of about 5% a year. Around 1983, he says, employers began to think of people less as assets than as costs. &quot;When the economy hits a rough spot, they're burdened with them almost as if they're a piece of equipment,&quot; he says.    So, faced with increased foreign competition, a slower rate of economic growth, and -- in some cases -- heavy debt burdens following mergers and takeovers, companies have begun to pare those costs.    Since the early 1980s, Mr. Jacobs says, companies that A.T. Kearney has surveyed have cut 11% from their managerial and administrative forces. Further cuts are planned by 77% of the companies. Meanwhile, temporary and contract help is projected to grow by 10% to 15% a year, at least through 1990.    &quot;Companies have changed to just-in-time inventories,&quot; says Thomas Plewes, an analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, referring to the keeping of inventories just sufficient to meet current demand. &quot;Now they want a just-in-time work force.&quot; Employers say it is more humane that way. &quot;When you hire someone on, you've made a commitment to them to take care of them for the rest of their lives,&quot; says Bradford Oelman, vice president of public affairs at Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. in Toledo.    But the layoffs and early retirements of the past few years have made it apparent that many companies can't keep the commitment. Just in the past year, Owens-Corning has reduced its costs by 50% and, by selling businesses, has reduced its revenue by 30%. One out of five employees in its remaining businesses has been let go.    But the company is using more temporary and contract workers.    Employees who keep their jobs, are becoming aware of the change in their status, and they fear for the future. Companies &quot;don't talk about people anymore,&quot; says a manager at Morton Thiokol Inc. &quot;They talk about head count.&quot; Says a Bell andamp; Howell Co. manager: &quot;We're strokes on a sheet.&quot;    Others observe that productivity is, after all, the name of the game these days. &quot;When you use outsiders, you don't worry that much about loyalty,&quot; says Michael D. Adler, the director of human-resource consulting for Ernst andamp; Whinney. &quot;You worry about budgets and getting the job done.&quot;    The country's largest corporations have already stopped creating jobs. From now on, labor specialists say, the growth will come at small companies. Big companies, of course, will fuel the growth -- with cash. The engineering budget of General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division, for example, is larger than the sales of all but 200 of the country's largest companies. The budgeted money is increasingly being spread among small suppliers and contractors.    Many are found near Interstate 75, a highway bisecting Detroit. &quot;I've got to think there are more engineering bodies in place and more thoughts applied to paper on either side of I-75 than anyplace else in Detroit, and that includes our very own hallowed Tech Center,&quot; a Chevrolet spokesman says.    With auto-industry work, Modern Engineering Service Co., in Warren, Mich., has tripled its sales to $160 million and its engineering staff to 3,500 people over the past two years. Indeed, Ralph L. Miller, the president, sees the day not too far off when firms like his will grow to the extent that they themselves will contract much work out to others.    The state of Wisconsin has all but abandoned the effort to attract big-company branch plants that made Wisconsin the &quot;Shining Star of the Snow Belt&quot; in the 1970s. &quot;The whole branch-plant phenomenon is drying up,&quot; says Randall Wade, a research director in Wisconsin's department of development. The state now is stressing entrepreneurial development with training and development seminars, management and technical assistance, and venture-capital financing.    Hugh Anderson, a Troy, Mich., consultant, has given so-called outplacement counseling to many discharged corporate minions. &quot;I tell them they're wasting their time looking at Fortune 500 companies,&quot; he says. Some colleges are telling their students the same. &quot;We certainly are channeling them in the direction of looking at smaller companies rather than large companies,&quot; says Barbara Koppelin, the director of the career-services center of Marquette University in Milwaukee.    To help the seekers of temporary work, new services are being organized. HR Consultants Resource in Rutherford, N.J., lists 1,200 executives eager to take temporary jobs. Headquarters Cos. in New York offers a $395-a-month package of telephone, telex, typing and secretarial services for work-at-home consultants.    At big companies, the survivors seem to be working harder to keep their jobs. &quot;Fear is a motivator,&quot; says Kathleen Christensen, the director of the national project on home-based work at City University of New York. &quot;If you're on track, you're going to do everything you can to stay on it.&quot; Contractors are working harder to keep their contracts. &quot;They realize there are three other agencies that would love the job,&quot; says William Hamilton, the manager of corporate communications at Owens-Corning, who supervises outsiders working on employee-communications projects.    Some scramble because they hope to become insiders. &quot;I want a full-time job,&quot; says a free-lance writer who has been working nights and weekends at one publication in hope of landing one. &quot;I'm tired of this insecurity.&quot;    Are employers somehow getting something for nothing? Not likely, some specialists say. The erosion of morale and loyalty means that &quot;a lot of people will manage their careers across companies, rather than in a single company,&quot; says Columbia's Mr. Ginzberg. &quot;They'll leave if they don't find the work interesting,&quot; he says. &quot;They aren't going to hang around and assume they'll get long-term payoffs.&quot;    That can mean high and costly turnover. At Modern Engineering Service, Mr. Miller is pleased that he has been able to reduce annual turnover to 30%. Until recently, it has been running as high as 400%. Even veteran employees are more willing to look for greener pastures. &quot;We have seen a tremendous increase in the numbers of inquiries and resumes from people we know are effective, and {it} would be a blow to their organizations if they leave,&quot; says Ernst andamp; Whinney's Mr. Adler.    Many managers are keeping as sharp an eye on their resumes as they are on the work they actually manage. &quot;Managers aren't going to want to work in groups where they can't have a good number on their resume,&quot; says Paul Hirsch, a professor of business policy at University of Chicago's graduate school of business. &quot;Every signal managers are getting is, 'Look out for yourselves,'&quot; says Mr. Hirsch, the author of &quot;Pack Your Own Parachute.&quot; In it, he advises employees to &quot;return calls from headhunters, stay marketable, and stay visible.&quot;    Some managers even warn their subordinates to keep looking over their shoulders. &quot;I tell people to think of this place as a nice place to work but not necessarily a place where you'll spend the rest of your life,&quot; says a manager at a company that has cut its staff and employed more outsiders. &quot;I say, 'What's happening to them may happen to you someday.'&quot;    A new hierarchy develops. Loren Hov lost his job at Stauffer Chemical Co. in a merger and has since done some consulting work for his former employer while he looks for other work. He says, &quot;Before, I was the boss. Now, they&quot; -- his former Stauffer colleagues -- &quot;are the boss.&quot;    Bonnie Bair left her job as head of business marketing at Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles to found her own at-home consulting company, offering services to the banking company. She enjoys setting her own hours and relishes the challenge of the new job. But as a lone contractor, she is cut off from old sources of information. &quot;I'm not privy to confidential information anymore,&quot; she says, adding that she had to &quot;read in the paper that Security Pacific will open an Orange County office&quot; -- information she could have used and previously would have heard on the grapevine.    Managers in newly mean and lean organizations must forgo some time-honored methods of building company spirit. Jeffrey Gittelman, the treasurer of Ideal Basic Industries Inc. in Denver, mourns the demise of company softball teams since the head-office staff has shrunk to 100 people from 400. &quot;I know from participating in them that they do build esprit de corps,&quot; he says. Now, he invites small groups of employees home to watch sports on television.    Job satisfaction suffers. &quot;Employee commitment is declining more than it ever has in the last decade,&quot; says Michael Cooper, the president of Strategic Management Associates, a part of the Hay Group of consultants in Philadelphia. In a 1977 Hay survey of 1,600 U.S. companies, 88% of middle managers and 72% of professionals expressed satisfaction with their company. By 1986, only 69% of middle managers and a little over half the professionals were satisfied. &quot;Their attitudes about their company, its management, the credibility of the communication they receive, their attitudes about their supervision, their compensation and benefits -- it's all across the board declining,&quot; Mr. Cooper says.    The egalitarian goal of parity in pay -- equal pay for equal work -- is being increasingly honored in the breach, as outsiders employed by small contractors work side by side with insiders at a corporation.    Some consultants with specialized skills, in computer programming, for example, can earn salaries many times those of their salaried brethren. But in most cases, the smaller the company is, the smaller the pay, at almost any level in the company. &quot;I work just as hard as they do for a third of the salary,&quot; says the free-lance writer, who is working full time in the same office doing the same type of work as salaried staffers.    To outsiders who themselves once enjoyed inside status, the adjustment is especially painful. Ms. Christensen cites the case of an insurance-company programmer who had earned $25,000 a year in salary but then was forced to accept less than $7,000 as a contractor for her former employer. And she lost all her company-paid benefits. Ms. Christensen forecasts a system with no benefits, no employer contributions to Social Security and no job training.    Whirlpool Corp. once trained all its engineers but believes it can no longer afford to train them for 12 to 24 months. Samuel J. Pearson, staff vice president for advanced development, says the company is turning over about 10% of its engineering work to outside contractors, and it plans to increase the rate to 20% by 1990.    Small contractors stay competitive in part by keeping benefit costs down. &quot;We don't offer pensions at all,&quot; says Gus Perdikakis, the president of GPA Technical Consultants Inc., a Cincinnati, Ohio, engineering firm that works on contract for some of the country's biggest corporations. &quot;We don't have dental insurance, and our vacation plan gives one or two weeks of vacation, not five or six.&quot;    Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C., says that more than 90% of companies with more than 1,000 employees offer a package of benefits. But, it adds, only 55% of those with fewer than 25 employees provide health insurance, and only 28% provide pensions.    As more work goes to a growing number of small companies, the number of workers covered by company-paid pension and health insurance plans seems likely to dwindle. The government will come under increasing pressure to finance health care for the working population. &quot;I think we may be heading for de facto national health insurance,&quot; says Ms. Christensen.    The evolution of a two-tier work force excites some people who enjoy the challenge of facing the world on their own, free of corporate constraints. &quot;When you work at Kodak, they baby-sit you,&quot; says Marlene Maggio, of Rochester, N.Y. She and her husband, Don, took early retirement from Eastman Kodak Co. to form their own photography venture. &quot;Now, we're grown-ups on our own.&quot;    They make enough money -- over $100,000 last year -- to tide them over the slack times, such as the period last year when surgery forced Mr. Maggio to turn down work.    But others worry about the stability of an economy in which people increasingly must fend for themselves. &quot;It is a highly insecure, highly volatile business,&quot; says a man who started his own public-relations business after losing his job at a big company. &quot;One wave you have money, one wave you don't.&quot;    &quot;Before, there was a paycheck every two weeks,&quot; says Ms. Bair, the former Security Pacific marketing manager. &quot;Now, you have to be more careful. There's no fallback. This is it.&quot;    A job at a big company hardly offers much more security these days. &quot;The safety net doesn't exist,&quot; says Mr. Adler of Ernst andamp; Whinney. &quot;We're all working without a net.&quot;    Columbia's Mr. Ginzberg agrees. The world of work, he says, &quot;damn well is less stable. It's less stable because the world is less stable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
