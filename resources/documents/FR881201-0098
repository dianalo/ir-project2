The license authorizes the Licensee to operate the Davis-BesseNuclear Power Station (Davis-Besse) in accordance with the conditions specifiedtherein.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.</ITAG>A special NRC safety inspection (Inspection Report No. 50-346/88027(DRP))conducted during the period from May 4 through September 2, 1988, and anNRC investigation (Investigation No. 3-88-008) confirmed an allegationregarding the discriminatory layoff by the former Quality Control (QC)Manager at Davis-Besse, Louis R. Wade, of a contract QC Inspector who hadraised safety concerns to licensee senior management. Specifically, theNRC concluded that the termination of the QC Inspector was a discriminatoryact in violation of 10 CFR 50.7 and is described in a Notice of Violationand Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty being issued this date. The detailsof the 10 CFR 50.7 violation are as follows.On July 10, 1986, a Potential Condition Adverse to Quality Report (PCAQR)was written by a QC Inspector concerning deficiencies in the installationof an electrical wire splice. Mr. Wade (who at the time was a QA engineer)was instrumental in having the PCAQR improperly invalidated instead ofprocessing it in accordance with station procedures which require thatPCAQRs be processed through the Shift Supervisor, the Plant Technical SupportDepartment and the PCAQR Review Board. (Mr. Wade was promoted shortly thereafterto QC Supervisor and then to QC Manager in 1987.) Because the QC Inspectorwas still concerned about the issue and refused to dismiss it, Mr. Waderequested that he formally document and clarify his concerns. The QC Inspectorreiterated his safety concerns and the improper way his concerns were handledin a memorandum dated October 10, 1986, and provided copies to the QualityAssurance (QA) Director and the Senior Vice-President, Nuclear. As a resultof the QC Inspector's memorandum, the QA Director (Mr. Wade's supervisor)investigated the matter and subsequently after several discussions withMr. Wade, issued a memorandum dated October 29, 1986, to Mr. Wade reprimandinghim for his improper handling of the QC Inspector's safety concerns.During the period between late September and early October 1986, in preparationfor an upcoming reduction in contact QC Inspector workforce due to theend-of-outage reduction in workload, Mr. Wade requested that the lead QCinspectors provide him with a list indicating the layoff sequence for contractQC inspectors. This QC Inspector's lead considered the QC Inspector tobe one of approximately four or five inspectors who were good performerswith multidisciplinary inspection skills who should not be laid off ifpossible. There is no question that the QC organization thought highlyof the QC Inspector who was considered a competent and respected inspector.Despite the recommendation to retain the QC Inspector if possible, Mr.Wade directed that the QC Inspector be laid off. Therefore, on October31, 1986, the QC Inspector was laid off. In addition, the QC Inspectorwas one of the first contract QC Inspectors to be laid off and he was thefirst QC Inspector to be laid off from his particular QC section. Moreover,within 15 days, the vacancy in that section created by his employment terminationwas filled by another contract QC Inspector.At the enforcement conference on September 26, 1988, the licensee informedthe staff that it had removed Mr. Wade's site access on September 23, 1988,and that it had terminated Mr. Wade's employment effective November 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.</ITAG>In addition to the discrimination issue addressed in section II above,additional concerns have been identified relative to the performance ofMr. Wade. A second special NRC safety inspection (Inspection Report No.50-346/88012 (DRP)) confirmed other allegations of activities conductedby or under the direction of Mr. Wade. A Notice of Violation concerningseveral violations identified during this inspection was issued on September22, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.</ITAG>Based on the results of the NRC inspection and investigation, the staffhas concluded that Mr. Wade intentionally removed the QC Inspector fromthe Davis-Besse facility for raising a safety issue. For almost two years,until disclosure by the NRC, the effect of this act had the potential to``chill'' the proper actions of others. The conduct of Mr. Wade removingthe QC Inspector who was properly raising safety issues cannot be tolerated.The public health and safety requires an effective quality assurance programin order to provide assurance that licensed activities are properly conducted.Moreover, a basic tenet of the Commission's quality assurance requirements,is that quality control workers must be free to be able to raise safetyconcerns without fear of retaliation.The actions of Mr. Wade as described in sections II and III above, demonstratethat he cannot be relied upon to assure that quality assurance programsare properly conducted and that quality control workers will be permittedand encouraged to raise safety issues. Therefore, I have determined thatI no longer have reasonable assurance that licensed activities conductedby or under the supervision of Mr. Wade will be conducted in accordancewith NRC requirements. Accordingly, I have concluded that it is necessaryfor the NRC to be informed if Mr. Wade is rehired to permit the NRC todetermine, at that time, whether further regulatory action is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161 b, 8, and o, 182, and 186 ofthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR Part 50, it is hereby ordered that:License No. NPF-3 is amended adding the following conditions:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Licensee shall provide the NRC Regional Administrator, RIII, writtennotice within one week of Mr. Louis R.
