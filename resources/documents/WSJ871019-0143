Connecticut: &quot;That Amendment was passed, not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of 'the General Government,' but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication. If any broad, unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the 'collective conscience of our people' is vested in this Court, by the Ninth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the Constitution, it was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court.&quot;    Prof. Tribe, Sens. Kennedy, Metzenbaum, Leahy and others disagree with Justice Black, and also with Judge Robert H. Bork.    David W. Dennis   Attorney   Richmond, Ind.   ---   Prof. Tribe reasserts his claim that in effect Justice Hugo Black believed that the Supreme Court could strike down legislation based upon liberties not enumerated in the Constitution. Prof. Tribe's position seems baffling given Justice Black's own words to the contrary.    For example, while dissenting in the 1946 case of Adamson v. California, Justice Black argued that: &quot;To pass upon the constitutionality of statutes by looking to the particular standards enumerated in the Bill of Rights and other parts of the Constitution is one thing; to invalidate statutes because of application of 'natural law' deemed to be above and undefined by the Constitution is another.&quot;    Justice Black adhered to the views set forth in Adamson throughout the remainder of his career. Indeed, while dissenting in the much discussed 1965 Griswold case (in which the majority struck down an anti-contraceptive statute), Justice Black again clearly and firmly repudiated the concept that judges have the power to create constitutional rights not set forth in the Constitution:    &quot;There is no provision of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court's belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational. The adoption of such a loose, flexible, uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional, if ever it is finally achieved, will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts and worse for the country.    &quot;Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would, I fear, jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up and at the same time threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have . . . . And so, I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law.&quot;    Unwilling to take one of the greatest jurists in history at his word, Prof. Tribe continues to assert that Justice Black in fact &quot;rejected&quot; the notion that judges may invalidate legislation only upon express constitutional provisions.    Prof. Tribe obviously believes that judges should rely on some form of natural law to fashion and to enforce unenumerated constitutional rights. Other jurists, including Justice Black and Judge Bork, have disagreed with this proposition. My point here is not that one side is right or the other wrong. It is rather that in the recent brouhaha over Judge Bork's nomination, Prof. Tribe and some of his allies have substituted partisan distortion for scholarly analysis.    David J. Menke   Attorney   Cincinnati   ---   The Ninth Amendment leaves with the people through their elected representatives the right to make decisions with respect to matters not enumerated in the Constitution. Would Prof. Tribe have us believe that judges represent the people rather than the peoples' elected representatives? We fought our Revolution to escape &quot;taxation without representation&quot; and we don't want to live under a government of laws enacted by judges -- or law professors -- whom no one elected to anything.
