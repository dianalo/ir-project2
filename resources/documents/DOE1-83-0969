A brief summary is presentedof the two primary maglev concepts: (1) the attractive-force, electromagneticsystem (EMS) and (2) the repulsive-force, electrodynamic system (EDS),and continues with a discussion of the advantages, potential for reducedcosts and higher reliability, that the newly-discovered, high-temperaturesuperconductors offer for EDS maglev vehicles. A summary of the currentstatus of worldwide maglev research is presented, followed by a discussionof the resurgence of US interest in maglev. An analysis of air-trafficcongestion suggests that maglev can substitute for short-to-medium distanceair travel. By promoting maglev as an airline technology, airlines canretain their familiar hub-and-spoke systems with maglevs an integralpart of the spoke portion. A preliminary analysis suggests that maglevcapital costs are likely to be comparable to those of interstate highways,and use of maglevs can declay the need for new airport and construction.For each short-to-medium flight diverted to maglev, an airline can substitutea longer flight. The short-haul flights use an inordinate amount of fuel,which is a major component of airline operating costs. Maglev energyconsumption would be significantly less and would not have the emissionsassociated with petroleum fuel. Finally, passengers should benefit frommaglev technology: travel options will be extended, delays will be reduced,and costs for inter-city travel will be reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
