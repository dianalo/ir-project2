In its proposed budget for the year starting Oct. 1, the Reagan administration also plans to expand its program to sell low-income housing to tenants and to increase the use of vouchers as a way of subsidizing housing.    According to Office of Management and Budget documents summarizing White House recommendations for the HUD budget, the administration plans to seek $12.6 billion in new spending authority for HUD, more than the administration proposed for this fiscal year, but far less than the $15.4 billion approved by Congress.    Despite cuts in certain HUD programs for the homeless, administration officials said the president's 1989 budget will call for substantially more spending on programs aimed at fighting homelessness than the $373.6 million approved by Congress for fiscal 1988.    In what is likely to be a controversial move, the administration rejected HUD's request for $50 million in grants to local governments for emergency shelters, arguing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was better equipped to handle temporary shelters, while HUD should concentrate on permanent housing. Congress appropriated $60 million for this program in fiscal 1987, but cut spending to $8 million for fiscal 1988.    The administration also seeks to redirect HUD's Section 202 housing subsidies so that they will help the handicapped, particularly mentally ill homeless persons. The OMB approved HUD's request for $326 million in new spending authority for this program, down from $556 million approved by Congress for the current year. But the budget office wants 90% of the money to go to the handicapped. Currently, nearly all of it goes to house the elderly.    The OMB also approved an increase to $75 million from $65 million for HUD's demonstration program to provide transitional housing -- as long as 18 months -- for homeless people.    Separately, a Department of Health and Human Services analysis of the spending plan approved by the White House shows spending on drug-abuse and AIDS programs would be increased, while family-planning, welfare and refugee programs would be cut in fiscal 1989.    Programs to combat drug abuse would get an 18% boost in fiscal 1989, according to an internal department document, including an increase in grants to states.    Within the $1.3 billion proposed funding for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the OMB approved $25 million for the construction of a Food and Drug Administration AIDS research facility in Bethesda, Md. Included in the proposed AIDS funding, which would be a 37% increase over fiscal 1988 appropriations, is $72 million for AIDS-testing surveys ordered by the White House Domestic Policy Council.    OMB officials seek a $100 million cut in family-planning grants. That would be a 28% cut from 1988 appropriations. &quot;No significant policy rationale was stated for this cut,&quot; said the HHS document, &quot;it is essentially a way for achieving budget reductions.&quot;    Under the White House plan, the HHS refugee-resettlement program would be totally phased out over three years, because of a declining refugee population.    The OMB's proposal for the HUD budget also calls for an additional 108,000 publicly assisted housing units, of which 100,000 would be supplied by giving vouchers to poor people, which would be used to rent privately built housing. To encourage state governments to expand voucher programs, the administration also wants HUD to pick up the administrative costs of such programs.    The administration also will propose reducing the Government National Mortgage Association's credit limit to $100 million in fiscal 1989 from $144 million approved by Congress this year, and to reduce the Federal Housing Administration's credit limit to $75 million from $96 million.    Burton Wood, a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, &quot;We have some concerns about the credit restrictions. That's a potential area of danger if the market becomes more active later in the year.&quot;    Among the agencies and programs that the Reagan administration -- once again -- will seek to eliminate entirely are the Interstate Commerce Commission and HUD's Urban Development Action Grant. Administration officials say the White House wants to alter the Economic Development Agency, a politically popular Commerce Department program that supports local economic-development efforts, but isn't expected to repeat past proposals to eliminate the agency. </TEXT></DOC>
