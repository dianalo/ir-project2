<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0503 </DOCNO><TEXT>Most microwave scattering measurements in tokamaks are done with the polarizationof the incident radiation approximately parallel to the toroidal field(ordinary mode) and at a frequency which is sufficiently above the plasmafrequency {omega}/sub p//sub e/ that refraction effects are small. However,as confinement devices get hotter, drift wave turbulence is expectedto occur at longer wavelengths. In order to observe density fluctuationsassociated with these phenomena with good spatial resolution, the idealprobe wavelength {lambda}/sub i/ is near or beyond the ordinary cutoffat {lambda}/sub i/ = 2{pi}c/{omega}/sub p//sub e/. As a result, we haveconsidered the propagation and scattering of the extraordinary (X) modewhere the incident polarization is nearly perpendicular to the confiningfields and where the cutoff density is significantly higher than in theordinary mode. We have modeled the propagation of the X mode in a tokamakfield geometry and shown that the polarization typically remains perpendicularto the local field along the ray path, simplifying the interpretationof the scattering results. We have calculated the single-particle crosssection and give a formula for X-to-X-mode scattering. An apparatus forcarrying out these measurements on TFTR at {lambda}/sub i/ = 0.5 cm willbe described. For B/sub T/ = 5.0 T, the X-mode cutoff density in thiscase is 1.5 x 10{sup 14} cm{sup -3}, so that a major part of the operatingdensity range can be studied by this technique.</TEXT></DOC>
