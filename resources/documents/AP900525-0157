Catholic Relief Services had been receiving $25 million a yearin U.S. grain for distribution by 4,600 groups in India.   The organization's headquarters in Baltimore described as``misleading and distorted'' reports from India about the audit.   First word of the audit appeared in a dispatch from New Delhi inFriday editions of The Washington Post. Officials in New Delhilater provided additional information.   A reorganization two years ago strengthened management andrecord-keeping ``and the recent audit acknowledged the improvementsbeing undertaken,'' said Robert Chatten, the charity's director ofpublic and governmental affairs.   Chatten said the audit ``did not find, nor do we believe thereexists, any pattern of widespread misuse of food in the Indiaprogram. The audit did conclude that, whatever problems may exist,food is reaching the poor'' and ``that is the point of theprogram,'' he added.   The audit by the U.S. accounting firm of Price Waterhouse wasordered by AID officials and concluded last December.   It said officials of India's Roman Catholic Church drew up boguslists of food recipients and used donations to run businesses.Clergy also purposely exaggerated the amount of aid theydistributed and filed false reports to hide the abuses, the auditsaid.   The audit estimated that records for food distribution andactual food distribution differed by about $4 million.   The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said the Central Bureau ofInvestigation, India's version of the FBI, and the investigativewing of the U.S. Agency for International Development are lookinginto the reported abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
