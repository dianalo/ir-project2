Stray dogs rummage through garbage near open sewers.   In the suburb of Petionville, a wealthy suburb overlooking thecity, a waiter in a spotless white dress shirt and black trousersserves fish creole, wild duck and chicken in mushroom sauce tovisitors at Le Pote Restaurant.   Less than a week after a military coup that sent Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy into exile, life is returning to normal in this city of 1million, capital of the Western Hemisphere's most impoverishednation.   For the first time since the revolt Saturday night, the sound ofautomatic weapons fire could not be heard early Thursday eveningfrom a house in Petionville, 20 minutes by car from downtown.   Earlier in the day, an unidentified corporal had appealed tosoldiers over Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic station, to stopfiring into the air because it was hampering the search for TontonMacoute henchmen, the dreaded private army of the 29-year Duvalierdynasty.   After President Jean-Claude Duvalier's flight to exile in Francein February 1986, the nation had been ruled by themilitary-dominated governments of Namphy and civilian PresidentLeslie Manigat. Since Namphy's weekend overthrow, the TontonMacoutes had been shooting indiscrimately.   The first indication that something momentous was happening cameon Saturday afternoon, when shots rang out in Champs de Mars Plazaseparating the luxurious National Palace from army headquarters.   People fled in all directions. As they ran past the Sacre CoeurRoman Catholic Church a few blocks from the plaza, rumors spreadthat a massacre like one that happened a week earlier had occurred.   Macoutes fired guns from a speeding pickup. Several cars crashedin the rush from danger.   At 6 p.m., Radio Haiti Inter failed to broadcast its eveningnews program, substituting instead music that in the United Stateswould be called ``easy-listening.''   At about 2 a.m. Sunday, state television came on the air to showan army sergeant, Joseph Heubreux, wearing helmet and combatfatigues. He introduced Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who said he hadaccepted an offer to become president and promised a return todemocracy.   Haiti's Mais Gate International Airport closed immediately afterthe coup, but reopened Monday. Normal radio and TV broadcastingresumed Sunday morning.   Throughout the week, state TV showed Olympic Games coverage fromSeoul, Korea, interrupting programming from time to time to deliverannouncements from the new military government.   The first days after the coup soldiers and civilians tookrevenge on suspected perpetrators of a massacre on Sept. 11 at St.John Bosco Roman Catholic Church in the La Saline slum, where thugswith machetes, guns, clubs and spikes had slaughtered 13 people andwounded 77 others. The church later was burned.   On Sunday, a mob supported by soldiers pillaged the home ofPort-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain, widely believed to be a Macouteleader responsible for the church massacre.   People huddled on downtown street corners during the night, asif waiting for something to happen. Rumors circulated that an armypurge of the Tonton Macoutes was imminent.   The next day, two suspected Macoutes were killed outside thegutted church, one shot by a soldier and one beaten or stoned todeath by a mob, according to independent radio reports. At leastone of the bodies was burned and left on the sidewalk in front ofthe church.   At least three other bodies reportedly were burned Tuesday.People stopped by to gape at the smoldering pile.   Meanwhile, rebellious soldiers were arresting their commandersand depositing them unharmed outside army headquarters. About 200people stood on the sidewalk across from the colonial-style,two-story building on Wednesday waiting for the next arrival.   A street vendor working the crowd sold snow cones from a woodencart, scraping ice from a slab and pouring syrup from old liquorbottles.</TEXT></DOC>
