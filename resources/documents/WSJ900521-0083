Now theycan carry fax machines, computers, laser printers, videocameras. On July 4 -- the date is no coincidence -- theSoviet Union's democratic subversives plan to assemble in thesame place for the first time, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Itought to be a shot heard 'round the world.   The Prague Conference, &quot;The Peaceful Road to Democracy,&quot;is being held at the invitation of Czech President VaclavHavel. Charter 77, the Czech human-rights group, is aco-conspirator. The main sponsor is the National Council toSupport the Democracy Movements in the U.S.S.R., a privateAmerican group whose honorary chairman is exiled dissidentVladimir Bukovsky. A co-sponsor is Democracy andIndependence, an umbrella group that speaks overseas for thesocialist empire's booming democracy movements. Thisorganization is led by Armenian dissident-in-exile ParuyrHayrikian.</LP><TEXT>   The idea is to bring together leaders from the SovietUnion's far-flung democratic groups to compare progress, setstrategy and draw more world attention. If Lenin were alive,he'd probably admire the subversive potential. In fact, ifthe Kremlin doesn't allow the democracy delegates to leavethe U.S.S.R., they plan to meet in Lvov, in the Ukraine, andhold a parallel conference that communicates with the one inPrague. The chairman of the Regional Soviet in Lvov,Vyacheslav Chornovil, is in the democratic vanguard.   These brave U.S.S.R. democrats haven't got the Westernattention they deserve. The Balts are well known, but eventhe mayor of Moscow is now a democratic reformer. The Russianrepublic may be on the verge of electing Boris Yeltsin,though it's fair to say Mr. Yeltsin's long Communist Partyties make him suspect among some democrats. Gary Kasparov,the chess champion, has resigned from the Communist Party andis starting a democratic group. He'll be in Prague. And Mr.Hayrikian, though stripped of his citizenship by Sovietauthorities, was still on the ballot when Armenians electedtheir own Supreme Soviet yesterday. Democracy is stirring inevery Soviet republic.   One goal in Prague will be to give every Soviet delegatewho attends the meeting a modern &quot;democracy kit.&quot; Theorganizers need: Apple and IBM computers, printers,photocopiers, fax machines, telephone-answering machines,cameras, video cameras, walkie-talkies, tape recorders,megaphones and 50 offset printing presses. In the InformationAge, these are the guns of liberty.   Many in the West fear these democratic movements mightdestabilize Mikhail Gorbachev. And it's true that glasnostand perestroika have allowed these movements to grow. But weagree with the Baltic and other democratic leaders who sayMr. Gorbachev must choose between the forces of reform andthe communist and military reactionaries. Perestroika isindivisible. The general belief now is that Mr. Gorbachevfaces a watershed at the Communist Party Congress in earlyJuly. A successful Prague rendezvous would signal to thecommunists that the grass-roots pressure for democracy isgrowing.   A democratic Soviet Union is in the long-term interests ofthe U.S. Only a nation with popular checks and balances willbe trustworthy enough to take a non-threatening seat amongWestern nations. No one knows yet if this is what Mr.Gorbachev has in mind. But while we're waiting for Gorby, theWest can support at the Prague meeting July 4 those Sovietswho've already decided.</TEXT></DOC>
