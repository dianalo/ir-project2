<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1027 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple theory of the heavy-ion optical potential V, based on the localdensity approximation, is presented. The colliding ions are describedlocally as two slabs of nuclear matter. The real part of the energy densityof the two slabs is derived from the properties of nuclear matter, andfor the imaginary part the ''frivolous model'' is applied. Results forV in the case of two slabs are presented and compared with results ofother calculations. Arguments are given in favour of using the frivolousmodel in the optical potential and the VUU calculations for heavy-ioncollisions.</TEXT></DOC>
