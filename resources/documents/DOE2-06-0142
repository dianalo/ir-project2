He further points to the transition rule in the 1986 taxreform bill, which essentially says, for resource recovery-related projects,if you've spent or committed to spend $200,000 by March 1, 1986, allof the old tax benefits are grandfathered. That includes the investmenttax credit and the accelerated cost-recovery system. Once those projectsare done, there is no further benefit for local governments to give upthe residual value of the plant. To Mr. Montrose this means, that projectswill still be done, and primarily on a tax-exempt basis, but will bedone under public ownership. He feels this is an off-shoot of the taxlaw rather than its intent. For the most part, he thinks it amounts toproviding an essential local government service of waste disposal.</TEXT></DOC>
