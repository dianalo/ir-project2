Washington said today it would study the request. The requestwas made by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who returned Friday froma trip to Washington, ministry spokesman Arieh Greenblatt said.   It will cost an estimated $3 billion to educate, house andemploy the immigrants, Greenblatt said.   He said that about one-third of that total would be sought fromthe United States, including $600 million in donations fromAmerican Jews and $400 million through U.S.-guaranteed loans.   The guarantees would allow Israel to borrow money fromcommercial banks at low interest. U.S. law limits loan guaranteesto $25 million per country per year.   Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the quasi-government Jewish Agency,which helps resettle refugees, told Israel radio today that about100,000 Soviet immigrants were expected over the next three to fiveyears.   Questions have been raised about whether Israeli plans to settlesome of the immigrants in the occupied West Bank might interferewith Middle East peace efforts.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthat, while Israel's request for $400 million in loan guaranteeswas being studied, the Bush administration would reject any effortto help resettle immigrants in occupied territories.   ``Our policy is we don't allow U.S. aid to be use forresettlement in the West Bank,'' Fitzwater said.   The spokesman said that Bush discussed the situation in generalterms with Peres last week when the president was in New York toaddress the United Nations.   ``The president emphasized his sympth;ay for that problem andcommitted to look into it. But we haven't discussed anyspecifics,'' Fitzwater said.   ``We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wantingto settle in Israel. There may be costs associated with that,''Fitzwater said.   But he added that, while the United States would do would itcould to help, there was no way it was going to provide money tohelp Israel settle immigrants in the West Bank.   Israel has occupied the West Bank _ home to one millionPalestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers _ since the 1967 MiddleEast war.   Israeli Housing Minister David Levy recommended in June that newimmigrants be put in West Bank settlements.   But the U.S. has repeatedly called on Israel to stop settlementactivity there, a major issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Atleast 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in the21-month-old Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip againstIsraeli rule.   Effective Sunday, the United States changed its visa rules tostem the flood of Soviet immigrants. Washington said the embassy inMoscow faces a backlog of 32,000 applicants. Of the 10,000 newapplications in August, 45 percent were Jews.   In addition, thousands of Soviet Jews who accepted Israeli visasare waiting at other European sites in hopes of getting visas toAmerica. But Israel has long pressed Washington to encourage SovietJews to emigrate to Israel instead of the United States.   Moscow-based Jewish activists say that many Soviet Jews seekingto emigrate to the United States may remain in the Soviet Unionrather than leave for Israel.   The American Jewish Committee estimates that more than 170,000Soviet Jews immigrated to Israel between 1965 and 1988.   The Soviet Jewish Education and Information Center in Jerusalemsays that of the 18,961 Jews who emigrated from the Soviet Unionlast year, 2,173 came to Israel. In the first eight months thisyear, 4,175 of the 34,610 Soviet Jewish emigres came to Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
