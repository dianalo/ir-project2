The company, a maker of compressed airflow devices used in industrial applications, said that under certain circumstances, shareholders will be entitled to buy one newly issued common share at $12 for each common share held.    Vortec said the rights plan wasn't a reaction to its rejection of a merger proposal from Hinderliter Industries Inc. last month. Hinderliter, a Tulsa, Okla.-based manufacturing and heat-treating concern, hasn't taken further action since the bid was rejected, Vortec said. </TEXT></DOC>
