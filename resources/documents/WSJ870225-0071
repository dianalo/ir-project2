The last &quot;megadeal&quot; of 1986 was completed: General Electric Co.'s $6.28 billion purchase of RCA Corp. Since then, there have been hundreds of corporate acquisitions -- but none that exceeded $5 billion. And there has been little to parallel the splashy takeovers of giant companies such as Gulf Oil Corp., General Foods Corp. or Hughes Aircraft Co. in previous years.    By several gauges, takeovers now seem to have reached a plateau. The big transactions aren't so huge anymore, and they tend to be friendly acquisitions within an industry, such as yesterday's $1.1 billion merger accord between Security Pacific Corp. and Rainier Bancorp. The dollar volume of mergers fell 3% last year to $173 billion -- the first drop since 1982 -- according to W.T. Grimm andamp; Co, a Chicago research firm. And dealmakers report a further decline so far in 1987.    The slowdown reflects more than just worries about insider trading, Wall Street professionals say. The new tax laws and a soaring stock market have a dampening effect as well, because they make takeovers more expensive. In addition, the acquisition boom simply &quot;may be taking a pause&quot; after six frenzied years, says Don Carter, a leading proxy solicitor.    Other changes are occurring in the takeover business as well. Hostile acquisitions are becoming tougher. Commercial banks are trying to make inroads as advisers. And investment bankers are being put on the defensive by the widening insider-trading    Such changes are good news for many executives. &quot;The ageof the all-knowing investment banker is gone,&quot; gloats AndrewSigler, chief executive officer of Champion InternationalCorp. Mr. Sigler has long argued that executives can performbetter if they aren't constantly worrying about takeoverspecialists ganging up on their companies.   Still, investment bankers are hardly on the ropes. John Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Inc., says he sees plenty of potential to help companies with divestitures, restructurings and leveraged buyouts, even if there isn't much demand for huge acquisitions. And if takeover volume dwindles 10% or 20% this year, it will still run at more than triple 1980's rate of $44 billion.    The insider-trading scandal &quot;obviously is going to have some effect on business, but I wouldn't overstate it,&quot; says Michael Dingman, chief executive of Henley Group Inc., a La Jolla, Calif.-based conglomerate. Mr. Dingman carried out five corporate transactions last year, and he figures he may do as many in 1987, using a variety of investment banks.    One clear change, though, has been a falling off in hostile takeovers. Financier Carl Icahn, for example, recently dropped efforts to take over USX Corp., an oil and steel company. Mr. Icahn cited USX actions that would have made his bid more expensive. But analysts questioned whether the insider-trading scandal also had cooled his interest.    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment bank that was to finance Mr. Icahn's bid, has been noticeably absent from the takeover scene this year. Drexel executives declined to be interviewed. Drexel is being investigated in the government's insider-trading probe, but has repeatedly said it knows of no wrongdoing by the firm or its current employees.    More recently, oilman T. Boone Pickens led an effort to acquire Diamond Shamrock Corp., but the company responded with anti-takeover measures and a restructuring plan that became more attractive to shareholders.    To some takeover-minded executives, the wisest course is to pick out acquisition targets on their own and use investment banks only in the final stages. &quot;We do a lot of our own work internally,&quot; says Irwin Jacobs, chairman of Minstar Inc. &quot;Too many chief executives are so insecure, they use their investment banker for everything.&quot;    Meanwhile, commercial banks hope Wall Street's troubles will help them win merger clients. Right after the latest insider-trading arrests Feb. 12, both Citicorp and J.P. Morgan's Morgan Guaranty unit ran big ads in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times for their merger departments. &quot;A super team is better than a super star,&quot; Citicorp declared, in a not-so-subtle dig at its Wall Street competitors.    The banks can cite some modest successes. Morgan Guaranty counseled Hiram Walker Resources Ltd. in its acquisition by Gulf Canada Corp., and Citicorp is advising Pan Am Corp. on the possible sale of its airline. &quot;We've seen an increase in deal flow that may be an outcome of the troubles of our competitors,&quot; says Richard Huber, a Citicorp executive, though he says that wasn't a factor in the Pan Am award.    Champion's Mr. Sigler says he welcomes the growing role of commercial banks in merger advice. &quot;They'll push the fees down,&quot; he predicts. In reply, Wall Street merger specialists say that commercial banks lack experience and can't pay high enough salaries to attract good talent. &quot;In five or 10 years, though, the banks could be a factor,&quot; says a top dealmaker.    Bankers Trust says its business share is surging already. It says it completed 41 transactions last year, valued at a total of $4 billion, up from 17 in 1985 with a total value of $1.2 billion. And David E. Dougherty, head of mergers and acquisitions at Bankers Trust, said companies may want to widen their range of merger advisers to include a commercial bank, in light of the insider-trading scandals on Wall Street.    But bankers may be too bureaucratic to make big inroads now, says Kamal Mustafa, a former Citicorp investment banker who currently works at PaineWebber Inc. Instead of phoning potential clients, &quot;they'll wait for some committee or senior management group to tell them what to do,&quot; he says.    In fact, Wall Street firms are encroaching on commercial banks' turf by making short-term loans to help complete transactions. First Boston Corp., for example, put up nearly $1 billion to help Campeau Corp. complete its purchase of Allied Stores Corp. Other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. also have become more active in such financings.    Also popular are restructurings, particularly where companies shed unwanted parts of businesses they may have recently acquired. First Boston, for example, is currently advising on a major divestiture program for Allied Stores. Foreign companies, notably British companies, have become slightly more active acquirers as well.    But recent changes in tax laws weigh against many takeovers. Until this year, acquirers could shelter some profits from taxes by revaluing certain assets of acquired companies and then taking higher depreciation charges. That's much harder now. Meanwhile, sellers no longer can invoke 1986's low capital-gains tax rates on their profits. Together, those factors have raised after-tax costs of many acquisitions at least 10%, specialists say.    The current bull market also is scaring off some would-be acquirers. &quot;Good values are getting hard to find,&quot; says Asher Edelman, a New York investor who is known to launch hostile takeover bids. But Wall Street professionals say more acquirers may turn high stock prices to their advantage by proposing stock-for-stock swaps, along the lines of yesterday's merger accord between Security Pacific and Rainier Bancorp. That way, companies needn't raise outside cash to finance acquisitions.    Investment banks also are likely to tighten up security checks on their top professionals. Most investment banks have long had elaborate systems with passwords, special keys and code names, all designed to make sure that lower-level employees or intruders didn't learn about pending takeover projects. But the recent insider-trading offenders nearly all have been takeover specialists who were entrusted with full information.    &quot;There's a total sea change in what firms are willing to consider&quot; as security steps, says Jules Kroll, a New York consultant on white-collar crime. Partners at some firms -- who once were subject only to the bounds of their own conscience -- may be asked to disclose their annual finances to a review committee and regularly sign confidentiality agreements, Mr. Kroll says. He adds that since the Levine scandal broke last May, four Wall Street firms and three law firms have hired him to review security procedures.    Another likely switch will be to shrink the deal-making teams that investment banks and law firms field. Because of concern about leaks, these squads may be cut to as little as three people per transaction, from 15 or more. &quot;There are suspicious people in the world, and they (clients) will probably want to be more cautious,&quot; says Mr. Friedberg, Merrill Lynch's investment-banking chief.    ---   1987's BIGGEST TAKEOVER ACCORDS                                                      Value**       Target Company   Prospective     Transaction  (in bil- Date* or Operation     Buyer           Type         lions) 2/10  Owens-Illinois   Kohlberg        Leveraged    $3.64                        Kravis Roberts  Buyout 1/16  Heublein unit    Grand Metro-    Acquisition   1.20       of RJR Nabisco   politan PLC 2/23  Rainier Bancorp.
