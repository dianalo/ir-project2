The FDIC arranged for three of the banks that were closed yesterday -- Liberty Bank, Houston; Sealy National Bank, Sealy, Texas; and First National Bank of Sapulpa, Sapulpa, Okla. -- to reopen today as branches of other institutions. The agency arranged to transfer the insured deposits of the fourth bank -- First National Bank in West Concord, West Concord, Minn. -- to another bank because the agency received no bids to purchase that institution.    Liberty Bank, which was closed by state banking authorities, is to reopen as a branch of Central Bank of Houston. Liberty had assets of $59.9 million and held $50.5 million in 7,000 deposit accounts.    Sealy National, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen as a branch of Austin County State Bank, Bellville, Texas. Sealy had $8 million in assets and held deposits totaling $7.8 million in 1,100 accounts.    First National Bank of Sapulpa, also closed by the Comptroller, is to reopen as a branch of American National Bank andamp; Trust Co. in the same city. First National had assets of $7.6 million and held $7.5 million in 1,400 deposit accounts.    The insured deposits of First National Bank in West Concord are to be available at Farmers State Bank, also in West Concord, beginning today. First National, also closed by the Comptroller, had assets of $9.1 million and held deposits of $8.8 million in 2,100 accounts. The FDIC said all deposits appeared to be within the federal insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. </TEXT></DOC>
