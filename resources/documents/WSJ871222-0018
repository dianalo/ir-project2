And the recipients are pretty unhappy about it.    Moody's, which is pushing for a bigger role in rating mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, has begun rating issues without being asked. That has issuers and investment bankers upset, largely because Moody's unsolicited ratings have generally been lower than those issued -- by request -- by the rating agency's chief rival, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Yesterday, for instance, it gave an unsolicited double-A-3 rating to a $135 million issue by Ryland Acceptance Corp. that Sandamp;P early this year rated triple-A, the top rating.    Moody's is frankly telling issuers that it's looking for a bigger share of their business, and that those who don't choose to deal with Moody's may get rated anyway. &quot;We said we want to express our opinion,&quot; says M. Douglas Watson Jr., the Moody's vice president who heads the structured transactions area. That area handles mortgage-backed and asset-backed financings.    Unsolicited ratings are standard practice in the traditional bond market, where major firms rate all issues, whether or not they're asked. But they're unheard-of in the asset-backed area, where the structure of the securities is so complex that many investment bankers and some officials of rating firms believe it's impossible to give an accurate rating without the issuer's cooperation. Standard andamp; Poor's entered this ratings area much earlier than Moody's.    &quot;Moody's whole currency is credibility,&quot; says Stephen L. Joseph, head of mortgage-backed securities at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;In the long run, they can't give a good rating without information and access. They have to make mistakes.&quot;    Some issuers claim the tactic amounts to a kind of polite blackmail. &quot;It's an implied threat,&quot; says one investment banker who, like most others, won't be quoted by name making any criticism of a rating firm. Standard andamp; Poor's declines to comment on Moody's action.    Whatever it's called, it seems to be working. Meritor Financial Group Inc., which began working with Standard andamp; Poor's last August on a $213 million issue backed by commercial mortgages, didn't think two ratings were necessary, says Richard Moore, a vice president at lead manager Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    Then Moody's made it clear it planned to rate the issue. So Meritor and Goldman cooperated, and the issue came to market this month with a triple-A from both agencies. Mr. Moore and Meritor officials say they didn't feel pressured -- but, Mr. Moore notes, &quot;if they were going to rate it anyway, it seemed wise to go ahead and work with them.&quot;    Other issuers haven't fared as well. L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co. decided it didn't need two ratings on a subsidiary's $100 million mortgage-backed bond issue last July. The investment banking firm got a triple-A from Standard and Poor's; a few weeks ago Moody's gave it a double-A. Officials at Rothschild, which is now working with Moody's to try to change the rating, declined to discuss the issue.    Moody's Mr. Watson defends the unsolicited ratings, which are issued mainly when Moody's disagrees with rival firms. Moody's mandate is to provide information to investors, he argues, and &quot;the information content would be greater where we differ&quot; than where there's agreement. Mr. Watson also says Moody's won't give an unsolicited rating unless it has enough information to rate the issue accurately.    The matter is contentious because ratings are an inextricable part of the asset-backed securities market. The structure of these securities, which are backed by pools of loans with little or no reliance on the issuer's own credit, is so complex that investors rely on the rating firms' scrutiny.    A high rating is essential -- in fact, triple-A has become the norm in the asset-backed market. If an issue can't qualify for a top rating, the issuer generally buys some type of credit enhancement -- either an insurance policy or a bank's letter of credit -- to produce a triple-A. But what satisfies one firm often doesn't satisfy the other. Moody's, for instance, wasn't confident that the structure of the Rothschild issue provided quite enough protection from creditor claims on the parent company to warrant a triple-A. Standard andamp; Poor's disagreed, and reaffirmed its triple-A.    To save time, trouble and expense, issuers often prefer to request, and pay for, just one rating. Corporate rating fees range from about $5,000 to $50,000. Only if two ratings produce a lower financing cost will issuers seek them.    Mr. Watson argues that investors in asset-backed securities really want more information, and that his firm is helping issuers by providing it. &quot;The securities are getting more complex, and issuers are dipping deeper into the quality bin,&quot; he explains. &quot;Investors see potential problems.&quot;    But Moody's rivals, and the investment bankers it deals with, claim its tough stance could backfire. Split ratings, especially on issues that were sold with single ratings, &quot;get investors all bent out of shape,&quot; says one investment banker, who argues that investors don't like having doubt cast on an investment they've already made.    And Jack A. Vogel, head of the rating committee at Fitch Investors Service Inc., a firm that isn't yet much of a factor in the asset-backed area, is expecting a boost out of the Moody's furor. &quot;To the extent any rating agency takes actions which create antagonism throughout the issuing universe,&quot; he says, &quot;it has been helpful to us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
