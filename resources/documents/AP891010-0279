The action marks the latest move toward equipment that iscompatible across the computer industry, easing some of theconfusion for customers who have had to struggle with diversesystems, analysts say.   ``With any large company, the most important and hardestbusiness problem is that they have all these different types ofdesktop computers, and they want all these people to worktogether,'' said Henry Ancona, Digital's vice president forbusiness and office information systems.   The new system will be compatible not only with Digital's VAXcomputers but with popular systems from International BusinessMachines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc., as well as software fromMicrosoft Corp., the company said.   Workers using this system ``can share computing software, andtransmit data, documents and pictures,'' Kenneth Olsen, presidentof the Maynard-based company, said in a statement. ``It's justcommon sense.''   The software, which was presented Tuesday at an office computerconvention in New York, will be available next year.   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind IBM,was long known for the compatibility within its VAX system. Digitalpromoted this with the slogan ``Digital has it now,'' a jab at itsgiant rival, whose systems until this year lacked that capability.IBM now has software that can run across the full range of itsmachines.   But company officials and analysts said Digital's move takescompatibility further by linking computers from different companies.   ``We believe that reflects the reality of the market,'' Anconasaid. ``It would be arrogant to tell a customer that if you buy ourcomputer, you have to throw out everything else you've investedin.''   ``I think DEC's made a very significant step forward,'' saidTerry Shannon, an analyst with International Data Corp., a computerresearch firm based in Framingham.   ``Digital is saying if you don't have a Digital PC (personalcomputer), it's fine,'' Shannon said. ``Their concern is theunderlying system.''   Computer software, which runs the machines, is becoming a morelucrative market than the computers themselves, which are becomingless expensive, Shannon said.   Also, Digital can employ the integrated system to introduce itsproducts to customers using other brands of computers, and possiblypersuade them to use more Digital equipment, said Sonny Monosson,publisher of The Monosson Report in Boston, which monitorsactivities at Digital.   The introduction of the new system comes as the company tries toreverse a sales slump.   Digital's earnings slid 22 percent for the year that ended July1, and the company has frozen salaries and transferred hundreds ofemployees from manufacturing to sales jobs.   Last week, John J. Shields, who was in charge of sales and waslong regarded as the No. 2 man at Digital, resigned. Analysts notedthat he had fallen out of favor amid the company's slowdown.   Part of the company's slump could be blamed on Digital's rapidintroduction of new products, which confused sales people andcustomers, analysts said.   But that will not be the case with the new system, Ancona said,since the programs will build on the VAX system, not depart from it.   ``There has been confusion ... it would be complicated aboutwhat they had and didn't have,'' said Walter Ulrich, an analystwith Arthur D. Little Inc., a Cambridge-based management andtechnology consulting firm.   ``But now they're able to give a more simple message about whatthey're doing,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
