In addition, small airlines are springing up to challengeEurope's heavyweight national airlines, and the governments thatown these big flag carriers are selling them gradually to privateinvestors.   These developments represent a major restructuring of the airtravel industry on this side of the Atlantic. It's part of theEuropean Economic Community's attempt to to dismantle the oldairline system ahead of the end of 1992, when the 12-nation blocwill become a trade barrier-free marketplace.   But there are concerns that Europe's airlines may become tooconcentrated and powerful because the number of carriers will bereduced, hurting competition and ultimately the fare-payingpassenger.   Some worry that Europe could be following the path of thederegulated airline industry in the United States, where takeoversand consolidation have reduced the number of competitors.   The move by some leading European airlines to buy stakes in U.S.airlines also has aroused controversy in the United States, wheresuch holdings are limited to 25 percent.   The U.S. Department of Transportation has ordered KLM RoyalDutch Airlines to cut its $400 million investment in NorthwestAirlines' parent company NWA Inc. to $176 million. Even though theplanned stake came to only 5 percent, the department said thedeal's size and structure might give KLM too much control.   The department also might intervene in British Airways' proposalto buy a 15 percent stake in United Airlines' parent UAL Corp. for$750 million.   ``There is radical change going on,'' said Stephen Clapham, aEuropean airlines analyst with the London investment firm HoareGovett Ltd. ``The general climate within Europe is one of anincreasing trend toward free market forces and the reduction ofgovernment influence.''   Hans Krakauer, deputy chairman of the International AirlinePassengers Association in London, said European airlines fear theeffect of liberalization on their own structure, and therefore arelooking at the idea of allying themselves with erstwhilecompetitors.   ``There is a certain fashion at the moment about joining up withsomebody,'' said Michael Bishop, chairman of British MidlandAirways.   The trend-setter is Scandinavian Airlines System, the firstairline to buy a stake in an American airline. A year ago itacquired 10 percent of Texas Air Corp., parent of Continental andEastern airlines.   SAS also holds a 25 percent stake in British Midland andcooperation agreements with Japan's All Nippon Airways andThailand's Thai International. In addition, SAS plans to invest inSwissair.   British Airways, Europe's largest airline, was denationalized in1987, and has teamed with United for two years under a jointmarketing agreement.   BA also acquired smaller rival British Caledonian Airways nearlytwo years ago and is seeking a joint stake with KLM in SabenaBelgian World Airways. BA has attempted, but so far failed, toobtain a stake in Air New Zealand.   No. 2-ranked Lufthansa German Airlines and No. 3 Air France,recently announced a wide-ranging cooperation agreement thatexpands an existing relationship.   They said they would cooperate on cargo, pilot training,aircraft purchases, marketing, catering and duty free sales. Theyalso said they hope for a similar pact with Iberia InternationalAirlines of Spain.   Swissair and Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, have bought 5 percentstakes in each other.   Not everybody is convinced that the airlines will benefit fromsuch ties, but there is a growing recognition among the Europeancarriers they are facing stiffer competition from overseas rivals,in America and elsewhere.   The carriers also fear that the EEC's 320 million people won'tbe enough to sustain Europe's 21 major carriers, and that to grow,they must expand abroad.   In the past, it was governments that set routes, capacity andfares in bilateral agreements which often acted as effectivecartels between any two given destinations.   The European Commission, the EEC's governing body, has beengradually relaxing these restrictions. This liberalization iscreating more choice and cheaper fares, but not fast enough, saidKrakauer, from the passengers group.   A good example of deregulation's potential effects comes fromthe London-Dublin route, controlled by British Airways and AerLingus until 1986 when the governments allowed a new Irish carrier,Ryanair, into the market.   Today, six airlines ply the route and Ryanair, flying to LutonAirport north of London, charges as little as 68 Irish pounds orabout $96 for a round-trip, compared with 121 pounds or $171 on AerLingus, which has more daily flights and lands at London's HeathrowAirport.   Ryanair is still losing money, but there has been a jump inpassenger traffic through Dublin Airport from 2.9 million in 1986to an estimated 5 million this year.   By linking up, the airlines want to channel passengers to eachother, reduce costs and gain access to crucial computerreservations systems, which are expensive and are operated mainlyby the large airlines.   All competitors are seeking more takeoff and landing slots atairports, one of the most important keys to profitable routes.Increased traffic has strained airport capacity and Europe'scomplex air control system.   Staff shortages, outmoded equipment and strikes by air trafficcontrollers have turned summer travel into a regular ordeal forEuropeans, and experts say the only solution is to integrateEurope's 22 different national air control systems into onesprawling network.   The major European airlines carried nearly 63 million passengerson scheduled European flights in 1988, up nearly 7 percent from theprevious year, while 75 smaller European carriers offer scheduledinternational services, up from 20 in 1978, the Brussels-basedAssociation of European Airlines said.   Smaller airlines are linking up with bigger ones to defend theirroutes.   ``The small fellows are going to have to become the tail end ofthe big ones or come up with some brilliant commercial idea on howto stay in existence in this competition,'' Krakauer said.   What worries some Europeans is the possible anti-competitiveeffect of joint agreements, particularly among dominant carriers,which the European Commission is reviewing.   ``I could see big airlines preventing others from using the bigairports, or preventing newcomers from having access to airports oraccess to computer reservations systems,'' said Avishai Gil, atransportation industry specialist with the International LaborOrganization, a Geneva-based United Nations agency.   ``It really depends on the governments,'' Gil said. ``Nobodyknows how things will go.''   British Midland's Bishop said: ``It's very important that theconsequences of deregulation in America are not repeated in Europe,which is a consolidation of the airlines, which is not necessarilyin the interest of consumers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Oct. 15</NOTE></DOC>
