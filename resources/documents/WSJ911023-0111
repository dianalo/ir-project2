That's why manyinvestors have taken the easy way out -- by buying asmall-stock mutual fund.   The trouble is, small-stock funds use widely differinginvestment strategies. As a result, even if you opt for amutual fund, your investment results may stray a long wayfrom the small-stock market averages.   For proof of that, look at how funds that invest in smallcompanies have performed in the recent small-stock rally.According to Lipper Analytical Services, small-stock fundshave surged an average of 49.6% over the past 12 months. Butmany funds have done a lot better, or a lot worse. MontgomerySmall Cap Fund, for instance, has soared 95.4%, whileColonial Small Stock Index Trust is up just 15.4%.   &quot;You've seen a substantial dichotomy between the moreaggressive `growth' managers and the more conservative`value' managers,&quot; says Peter Schliemann, manager of theBabson Enterprise Fund, a small-stock mutual fund.   The biggest gains in the past 12 months have gone tostock-pickers who look for companies with rapid earningsgrowth, while the poorest performers have tended to be thevalue players who hunt for stocks that are cheap relative toassets or current earnings.   But if you take the recent poor performance of value fundsas a signal to dump value and buy growth, you could be makinga bad mistake. The reason: Growth doesn't always outpacevalue. In 1988, the last time small stocks outperformedlarger issues, many small-company value funds posted returnsof 20% and up, while some small-stock growth funds barelymanaged to generate double-digit gains.   Because it's so difficult to predict which types of fundswill do well, &quot;you might be well-served by buying two orthree funds that have vastly different styles,&quot; says GeraldPerritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, a Chicagonewsletter. &quot;That way you'll be sure of catching thesmall-stock effect.&quot;   Fund specialists say it's probably advisable to own bothan aggressive small-stock growth fund, such as MontgomerySmall Cap or Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth Fund, and amore conservative fund like Pennsylvania Mutual Fund orNicholas Limited Edition.   To find out what sort of stock-picking style a fund uses,try asking one of the fund's telephone servicerepresentatives. Alternatively, look at the past year'srecord. Aggressively managed small-stock growth fundstypically have returned more than 50% in the 12 months endedSept. 30; conservative growth funds and value funds are upsomewhat less.   While the idea of owning a couple of different funds isadvocated by many fund specialists, there are three otherstrategies that fund investors may want to consider:                                                                                                          Try publicly traded funds. Savvy investors might want toconsider one of the exchange-traded small-stock funds. Theseso-called closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares,which then trade publicly just like any other stock.   Oftentimes, it is possible to buy shares of theseclosed-end funds for less than the fund's underlyingper-share portfolio value, so that you are buying the fund'sportfolio for, say, 90 cents on the dollar. Among thesmall-stock funds currently trading at a discount are RoyceValue Trust, Morgan Grenfell SmallCap Fund andInefficient-Market Fund.   &quot;The two that we have been buying and like very much arethe Royce Value Trust and the Inefficient-Market Fund,&quot; saysJohn Bowling, president of Cincinnati's Bowling PortfolioManagement. &quot;The more aggressive alternative is MorganGrenfell SmallCap Fund. But the discount is very small onthat, and there's a risk that the discount may widen.&quot;                                                                                                          Cruising in convertibles. Cautious investors might want toconsider a fund that invests in convertible bonds. Becausemost convertible securities are issued by smaller companies,the funds that specialize in these securities have done wellthis year, gaining an average of 22.6%. That's better eventhan the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, which is up 20.3%in the same period, according to Lipper Analytical Services.   Convertible bond funds, which own bonds that can beswapped for stock at a fixed price, kick off more income thana regular small-company stock fund. According to Lipper, theaverage convertible fund yielded 5% over the past 12 months,vs. just 0.8% for the average small-stock fund. Dividendyields provide a cushion for investors when stocks fall.   For those looking to play the small-stock rally usingconvertibles, fund analyst John Rekenthaler suggests buyingeither Vanguard Convertible Securities Fund or FidelityConvertible Securities Fund, both of which can be boughtwithout paying a sales commission.   Vanguard &quot;has done well this year,&quot; says Mr. Rekenthaler,editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a Chicago newsletter.&quot;Fidelity has also done well. It's definitely the class actof the group, and it also has a smaller orientation.&quot;                                                                                                          Consider indexing. If picking among all the varioussmall-stock funds sounds too much like hard work, considerbuying an index fund instead. An index fund simply buys andholds the stocks that make up a particular stock marketindex, and thereby hopes to track the index's performance.   But even picking an index fund isn't straightforward. Manyof the index funds that buy smaller stocks, like Dreyfus'sPeoples Sandamp;P MidCap Index Fund, Rushmore Over-the-CounterIndex Plus Portfolio and Vanguard Extended Market Portfolio,own stocks with average stock market values that are somewhatabove that of the typical small-stock fund. And while youwould expect an index fund to produce average results, thathasn't been the case with Colonial Small Stock Index Trust,which over the past year has badly lagged behind othersmall-stock funds.   If you want a pure small-stock play, &quot;you don't have a lotof choice in the index area,&quot; concludes Morningstar's Mr.Rekenthaler. His favorite: Vanguard Small CapitalizationStock Fund, which seeks to track the performance of theRussell 2000-stock index. The fund is up 45.9% over the past12 months, slightly behind the average small-stock fund.</TEXT></DOC>
