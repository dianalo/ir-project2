In implementation of that Order, the Treasury Departmentissued the Panamanian Transactions Regulations, 53 FR 20566 (June 3, 1988),as amended at 53 FR 23620 (June 23, 1988); 53 FR 32221 (August 24, 1988);and 53 FR 37556 (September 27, 1988) (the ``Regulations''). The Regulationsprohibit, inter alia, transfers and payments to the Noriega/Solis regimefrom the United States, or by U.S. persons and U.S.-controlled Panamanianentities located in Panama, with certain exceptions, and require that amountsowed to the Government of Panama be paid into an account of the Governmentof Panama maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the ``FRBNY'').This rule amends the Regulations to authorize a substitute procedure forpayment to the FRBNY. Persons owing amounts to the Government of Panamamay apply for a specific license authorizing the blocking of the amountsowed, plus applicable interest, in a reserve account on their books. Anyperson who has already made payments to the FRBNY and who wishes to transferthe funds to a blocked reserve account, may apply to the Office of ForeignAssets Control for a license authorizing such a transfer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: </T2>Contact William B.
