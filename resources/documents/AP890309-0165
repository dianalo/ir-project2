Cheekexpressed regret Thursday over the student protests which led to theresignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwaterfrom the board of trustees of the predominantly black school   ``We simply are hurt,'' Cheek said. ``We feel that the wholeepisode has been a very sad episode.''   A student demonstration ended Thursday when the universitygranted the students' demands, which included Atwater's resignationfrom the Howard board.   Speaking after a Capitol Hill hearing on Howard's budget, Cheeksaid he wished Atwater hadn't resigned.   ``We're very disappointed that he found it necessary to dothat,'' he said. ``We understand, of course, the conclusion that hefinally reached.''   He added that Atwater, who was unanimously elected by the boardof trustees which included two student representatives, hadexpressed his willingness to still work on behalf of the university.   Politics weren't the issue in the protest, Cheek said. ``Theefforts to make this a political issue were simply exploiting(it),'' he said.   Howard University officials, who reached a settlement withstudent protestors early Thursday, appeared before a House educationsubcommittee requesting $184.9 million for fiscal 1990, a 3.3percent increase over last year.   The students left the administration building around 4 a.m.,following several hours of negotiations involving Jesse Jackson,District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry and Walter Fauntroy, thedistrict's non-voting delegate in Congress.   ``You stood up and said `we have an insult level' and Howard hasestablished a watershed movement,'' Jackson told the students at thepredominatly black campus. He called it a ``great victory.''   Student leader April Silver declared, ``We have done it. We havemade not a national statement, but an international statement to theworld.''   University spokesman Alan Hermesch said the students left thebuilding Thursday morning and repairs to the doors and windows wereunderway.   The demonstration ended after university officials delivered aletter promising that students will not be punished forparticipating in the action.   Atwater resigned Tuesday, saying he was worried the occupationmight lead to injuries.   After learning they had succeeded in driving Atwater from theboard of trustees, the students turned to demands involvingcurriculum, financial aid and improved security.   The demonstration disrupted classes and the students Wednesdayblocked the entrance of a site they thought was being used fortemporary administrative offices.   Atwater was appointed to the board in December. The protest beganFriday when the students disrupted a convocation ceremony for theschool's charter day that was to have included a speech by comedianBill Cosby.   The students recommended Thursday that Cosby be named to replaceAtwater.   Atwater complained he was the victim of an ``unfair portrayal''of his civil rights positions by Howard students.   Students contended that Atwater encouraged racism while managingPresident Bush's 1988 campaign by using ads that focused on convictWillie Horton Jr., who is black. Horton raped a Maryland woman whileon furlough from a Massachusetts prison.</TEXT></DOC>
