Will the 12 separate nations, with their various languages andcultures, eventually merge into a sort of United States of Europe?   Or will they limit themselves to closer cooperation in foreignand security matters?   At the end of a special one-day summit in Dublin Saturday, theleaders themselves appeared at odds over what they had agreed to do.   ``Clearly, they do not quite know what political union means,''British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said of her colleagues inthe trading bloc. ``It astounds me.''   European unity was a dream born from the rubble of World War IIand led to formation of the European Community in 1957. Now, withEastern Europe in upheaval, Western Europe feels a compulsion toact as a kind of counterweight, and that means closer ties.   In their final statement, the leaders said they confirmed their``commitment to political union.''   They asked their foreign ministers to draw up models for apolitical merger. The proposals will be given to the leaders whenthey meet again in Dublin in late June.   The new impetus for political closeness came from West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.   They sent a letter on April 20 to Irish Prime Minister CharlesHaughey, current EC president, urging fellow leaders to``accelerate the political construction of the Europe of theTwelve.''   They said the issue should be discussed at the unscheduledsummit, called by Haughey to air concerns over German unification.Kohl later said German unity and European integration were ``twosides of the same coin.''   To Kohl and Mitterrand, a political merger means strengtheningthe weak Strasboug-based European Parliament and other agenciesthat now administer the trading bloc. They also want the bodiesmore accountable to the public.   And they see unity as requiring a common foreign and securitypolicy.   To Mrs. Thatcher that sounded ambitious, coming three days afterKohl and Mitterrand broke ranks with the community over Lithuania.   The French and West German leaders issued their own statementcalling on the Soviet republic to suspend its March 11 declarationof independence from Moscow. Just five days earlier, foreignministers of the dozen nations carefully crafted a plea forrestraint on both sides.   ``So there you are ... this is one thing that makes me realizethey will never think of giving up national sovereignty, which Idon't criticize, I'm very pleased about,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.   The British leader spelled out what political union shouldn'tmean: Tossing out Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, doing away withnational legislatures, giving up the ability to declare war.   ``In the ultimate, war or peace is a sovereign decision,'' shesaid.   She also noted the countries maintain different defense postures.   Ireland is neutral, and France refuses to link its militaryforces to the military command of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   ``You simply cannot have a common defense policy in thecommunity as it is,'' she said.   Even so, the other leaders appeared intent on coming up withproposals that would give the community more political muscle.   Their strength so far has been in the economic area.   They have mounted a campaign to create a vast market of 320million consumers by 1993. By then, they intend to eliminate themany trade barriers preventing the free flow of money, people,goods and services.   Already EC nationals can travel without passports among membercountries. There are shared arrangements for health care. Britonsare buying second homes in France in anticipation of an underwatertunnel that will link the countries in three years.   The governments intend to create an economic and monetary union,which would lead to a common currency and a European-wide system ofcentral banks. They will meet in December to change their foundingTreaty of Rome so they can forge the economic links.   On Saturday, they decided they almost certainly will do the samefor political union.   ``We've now embarked on a course of action,'' Haughey said.``The whole process is now inevitable.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Sally Jacobsen, based in Brussels, Belgium, hascovered international economic issues for the Associated Presssince 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
