In the heat pump cycle, the compression of the refrigerantvapor consumes a certain amount of power, and the power consumption increasesrapidly as the vapor output temperature or the compression ratio is raised.When the amount of energy saved is counter balanced by the power consumption,either on the basis of the money paid for the electric power consumed,or on the basis of actual energy saving, this technique becomes inefficientor not worthwhile. Interstage cooling of the compression process is ameasure often used to cut down the power consumption, but the numberof stages is limited, and the amount of energy saved is insignificant.The compression process with interstage cooling is a controlled processand the compression line is an artificial line. If the compression processin the heat pump system is made to follow a certain pre-determined line,say, an isenthalpy line or any other line in which the enthalpy of workingsubstance is maintained nearly constant, by way of vapor cooling &quot;in&quot;the compression process, instead of &quot;after&quot; a compression stage, thepower consumption will be significantly reduced, because the output enthalpyof fluid is nearly equal to its input value, but at a higher pressureand temperature level. In order to realize the internal cooling, axialflow compressor with hollow blades having small holes on them or reciprocatingengine having cylinders with small injection holes should be used; thenthe same working substance in liquid state is injected through thoseholes into and along the stream. The method of calculation of the amountof cooling fluid injected is given. A numerical example shows the C.O.P.of the system is raised from 2.38 to 6.00.</TEXT></DOC>
