Paul Simon said Sunday.   Simon, D-Ill., speaking during closing ceremonies of the FirstCongress of Chinese Students in the United States, said the Bushadministration has followed the right direction in its response tothe violent crackdown on protesters, but now must take strongeraction.   Simon said he was opposed to restrictions on food and medicine,``but beyond that, we should be joining other nations and we shouldbe leading other nations to see that there are joint economicsanctions so that the government of China feels very, very clearlythe economic muscle that we put on the side of freedom.''   Simon congratulated the student group for reaching its main goal_ the creation of a federation to coordinate the efforts of Chinesestudents in the United States _ and pledged his help to bringreforms to China's communist government.   ``You and I have a mission, and that mission is to bring freedomto all the people of China,'' Simon said, prompting loud applauseand cheering from many of the 400 conference delegates andobservers gathered in a conference hall at the Chicago campus ofthe University of Illinois.   During the three-day congress attended by students from 200colleges and universities, delegates also established duties forthe new federation, including lobbying other governments forsupport and publicizing their cause through demonstrations andsponsorship of an independent newspaper in the United States.   Several journalists from opposition newspapers based in HongKong and Taiwan attended the closing ceremonies, along with eightdissidents who participated in the April and June protests inBeijing, conference organizers said. Neither the dissidents norjournalists addressed the crowd Sunday.   Speaking to reporters after his address, Simon said he and othercongressional leaders have met with Bush administration officialsto press for a greater response to the June killings ofpro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and thecontinued suppression of their supporters.   The Bush administration, while resisting calls for economicsanctions, has cut off sales of military equipment, barred militaryand other high-level visits and suspended U.S. support ofinternational bank loans.   Simon said he understands the need for caution, but added,``We're talking about a very clear-cut choice between oppressionand freedom and in that kind of a clear-cut choice I think we oughtto stand up.''   Simon emphasized that the United States should maintainrelations with the Chinese government even while imposing sanctions.</TEXT></DOC>
