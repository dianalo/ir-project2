The stainfrom that global financial octopus called the Bank for Creditand Commerce International (BCCI) is spreading rapidly asBCCI comes under sustained attack from banking regulatoryauthorities, prosecutors and legislative committees. Twoquestions arise: How many well-known political personalitiesaround the world will be touched by the stain? How viciouswill the melee become as it grows more political?   The answer to both questions is likely to be &quot;plenty.&quot;Clark Clifford, Jimmy Carter, Bert Lance, Andrew Young,former U.S. Republican Senator Charles &quot;Mac&quot; Mathias, Jr.,former British prime minister Lord Callaghan, and AlanGarcia, former president of Peru, are among those alreadybeing asked why they profess to know so little about BCCIpeople who've been their friends or business associates.</LP><TEXT>   As prosecutions and investigations proceed, others will bequeried. Some very explosive questions either will or won'tbe answered, depending upon how far the investigators go. Forexample, did any members of the U.S. Congress or any U.S.government officials receive special favors from Mr.Clifford's BCCI-controlled Washington D.C. bank, FirstAmerican Bankshares? Were there quids pro quo? If so, didthey have any bearing on U.S. foreign policies, especiallythose involving Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf sheikdoms?If BCCI was a conduit used by the Arabs to buy influence, didthe conduit reach other capitals, such as Paris or London?   These questions must be asked because it already is clearthat BCCI was not an ordinary bank, if it can be called abank at all. The Sunday Times of London yesterday reported,for example, that it has documents showing that the Arabterrorist Abu Nidal had used a BCCI account for hisactivities and that the terrorist group Hezbollah almostcertainly had too.   My friend and former colleague James Ring Adams iscompleting an exhaustively researched book about BCCI. Hesees this strange global organization as having two poles.One is Agha Hasan Abedi, its Pakistani founder. The othercenters on the Gulf Arabs, who backed Mr. Abedi and who nowcontrol the bank. One of the Arabs linked to BCCI, KamalAdham, is an especially interesting figure because he hasserved the Saudi royal family as an intelligence chief andforeign policy adviser.   The charismatic Mr. Abedi built the bank, using in part acoterie of Pakistanis who, like himself, were refugees fromthe Pakistan-Indian war. Whether he intended that it floutnational banking laws and engage in such nefarious activitiesas drug money laundering is unknown, but he clearly organizedit so that it would be, in effect, offshore everywhere, andthus hard to regulate. Mr. Abedi was adept in making highlyplaced friends, such as Mr. Carter and Lord Callaghan, andmany remain loyal to him. Lord Callaghan asserted to London'sIndependent newspaper last week that Mr. Abedi &quot;had a deepmoral concern.&quot;   More interesting, however, is the Gulf Arab connection.BCCI, able by means of the Abedi design to conceal much ofits activity, apparently supplemented Mr. Abedi's schmoozingwith hard cash. Initial investigations, as described in thetop-notch reporting of the Journal's Peter Truell, suggestthat BCCI was extremely kind to some borrowers -- whichaccounts for why its books contain so many loans that are notbeing repaid. In Arab terminology, spreading cash around iscalled &quot;money favoring.&quot; Arab kings and dictators consolidatepolitical support this way. In the West, under somecircumstances, it would be called bribery.   This is only informed speculation, but it is easy towonder if BCCI was used by the Gulf Arabs to do &quot;moneyfavoring&quot; on a global scale. The Gulf kingdoms havetraditionally been rich in money and weak in politicalinfluence. BCCI at its height operated in 70 countries.Because of its global nature and its roots in the banksecrecy laws of Luxembourg, it was in a position to do bigfavors to national leaders, especially in the world's dirtierbackwaters. It could, for example, help a local tyrant saltaway cash stolen from his national treasury to use should hebe forced into early retirement. One might say that, with itsmoney laundering capabilities and all, BCCI was a fullservice bank.   Apparently, some of those services misfired. Peru and astring of other countries are said to have turned over largeamounts of central bank reserves to BCCI to shield them fromcreditors. But BCCI was not very good at preserving cash, asevidenced by the discovery by banking investigators that itslosses could go as high as $15 billion. The entire range ofservices BCCI may have provided to politicians around theworld is not yet known, but the possibility that it alsodealt with money to pay for illicit arms shipments andterrorism is another ripe subject for investigation, as theSunday Times has found.   One nettling question is why BCCI so particularly wanted abank in Washington D.C. It could easily have carried on itsU.S. activities through a less prominent bank. And why did itwant a leading Washington political figure, Mr. Clifford, tohead the operation? Mr. Clifford is a lawyer, not a banker.   Mr. Clifford has insisted that First American Bankshareshas been guilty of no improprieties under his management andthat of his associate, Robert Altman. Mr. Clifford alsoclaims that he was not aware of BCCI's presence behind theinterests that acquired First American, and hence is notculpable in the matter that most interests Manhattan DistrictAttorney Robert Morgenthau, whether the true ownership of abank doing business in New York was illegally concealed. Bothof his claims may well be true, but it remains to be seen howthey will fare in court if a New York grand juryinvestigation of the case leads to indictments, as seemslikely.   If the BCCI case turns political as well, it seems certainthat Washington politics will be roiled to an extent at leastequal to the churning of Iran-Contra and Watergate. Democratslike Mr. Clifford and Mr. Carter have taken most of the heatso far, but if things get nasty, the Democrats will beslinging mud too. Some already has been slung at RobertGates, President Bush's nominee to head the CentralIntelligence Agency. He is being associated, although onlytenuously, with alleged use of BCCI by the CIA to do somemoney favoring of its own.   At this point, the BCCI affair is being described as thebiggest financial scandal of the century. What we don't knowyet is whether it will become one of the biggest politicalscandals as well. Depending on how far the investigations goin the highly-charged atmosphere that will certainly surroundthem, we may soon find out.</TEXT></DOC>
