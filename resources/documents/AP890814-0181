MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once, while Oliver North was riding high, aspokesman for Ronald Reagan's White House issued a statement thatseemed to rule out U.S. talks with Lebanese hostage-takers. Northobjected, saying that administration policy was to invite talkswhile forbidding any concessions to terrorists.   So the statement was amended.   In that 1985 refinement, the Reagan administration said it hadoffered to talk with anyone, including the kidnappers themselves,but never had received a response.   The distinction was a fine one, revolving around the question ofwhat would amount to negotiating with terrorists, as opposed totalking with any and all parties about freeing the captives.   To negotiate is to communicate with another party in an effortto settle something. The word implies bargaining and compromise,yielding one thing to get another. President Bush says he will notpermit that. Reagan said so publicly, even while his administrationwas secretly breaching its own rule in the Iran arms-for-hostagesdeal.   As Bush seeks to open lines of discussion for the release of theeight Americans held captive in Lebanon he has drawn the lineagainst the kind of negotiation that would amount to ransom forhostages. ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some otherAmerican, perhaps in some other place at some other time, atrisk,'' Bush said last week. ``And that means trading off ornegotiating for hostages.''   Put another way, Bush said he would ``do nothing that will beseen as quid pro quo for hostages.''   The president said there was no subtle change in policy behindhis statements. The record bears him out. His position in thecurrent situation matches the avowed policy of the Reagan years,when the Beirut hostage ordeal began. As vice president, Bushheaded a task force on terrorism which declared in its 1986 reportthat there should be no negotiations for deals with terrorists.   But there has been a change in tone in the heightened tensionover hostages since Israel seized a Shiite cleric in southernLebanon on July 28. Bush said he is looking for contact throughevery possible channel.   ``I'm not talking about terms, I'm talking about talking to getpeople out that are held against their will,'' he said. ``And Ithink I covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when Isaid good will begets good will.''   That message was directed to Iran, which holds some measure ofcontrol over the Shiite Moslem factions holding the Beiruthostages. Tehran is said to have offered help on the hostages inexchange for the release of Iranian assets held by the UnitedStates.   The administration is willing only to suggest that good thingscould happen if the atmosphere between the two nations were toimprove after a decade-long freeze _ and that nothing would do moreto improve it than release of the hostages. Longest held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,kidnapped on March 16, 1985.   In a way, that does involve negotiations, guarded and indirect,toward a long-term thaw that would bring freedom for the hostagesand later, presumably, would include the release of Iranian assetsimpounded by the United States in the embassy hostage crisis adecade ago.   That won't be a simple process; U.S. and Iranian estimates ofthe sums involved are billions of dollars apart, and aninternational tribunal in The Hague is settling asset disputes.Some $3.9 billion in Iranian assets were returned after the embassyhostages were released in 1981.   There's at least a chance that pattern could recur, and theadministration knows that if it did, there would be suggestionsthat the whole deal had been cut in advance. But the White Housesays it won't be done that way.   ``We are not willing to link the Iranian assets questions to thehostage question,'' Fitzwater said. ``...That fits within thedefinition of our policy of not trading arms or money or whateverfor hostages and of not paying ransom for hostages.''   He said that applies even though the assets were frozen in thefirst place because Americans had been taken hostage.   Then the other, conciliatory half of the message: theadministration is open to improved relations with Iran, and ``thereare benefits associated with having better relations with theUnited States.''   ``But we wouldn't speculate on any specific one,'' Fitzwatersaid.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
