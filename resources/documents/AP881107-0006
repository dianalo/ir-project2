As they filed past the first Hispanic member of a president'sCabinet, the son of a ranch hand told each child how he too had oncestudied in the tiny schoolhouse nestled among the prickly brush andmesquite trees on the King Ranch.   ``You can do it if you just stay in school,'' Cavazos told them.   ``When we talk to young people about opportunity througheducation, it helps to have a man at the top who proves through hisown life and experience that the American system of opportunitythrough education works,'' says Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.   Cavazos was born on the King Ranch, which is the largest in theUnited States and covers 914,000 acres in South Texas. The ranch,which includes parts of six counties between Harlingen and CorpusChristi, is the bedrock of one of the nation's biggest oil and gasfortunes and is credited with the development of the Santa Gertrudiscattle breed, the first native to this country. Darwin Smith,chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark Corp., is chairman ofthe privately held ranch.   Cavazos, who began his schooling along with other cowboys'Spanish-speaking children at the ranch, became education secretaryon Sept. 20.   His nomination by President Reagan to replace William J. Bennettfrom a list of Latino candidates was criticized by Hispanic leadersas a political ploy to bolster Republican presidential nomineeGeorge Bush in the Hispanic community.   Rep. Albert Bustamante, a San Antonio Democrat and chairman ofthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said at the time: ``It seems thatthe administration has just discovered that Hispanics exist.''   But he praised Cavazos, the president of Texas Tech Universityand its medical school since 1980, as ``well respected, wellprepared, with a history in education that is second to none.''   Cavazos will serve until Jan. 20 unless reappointed by the nextpresident and brushes aside questions about the next turn in hiscareer, saying he reached his life's goal when he became a fullprofessor.   He is firm in insisting no deal has been struck for him to remainin the Cabinet if Bush wins on Tuesday, but speculation is strongthat Cavazos would be asked to stay.   Cavazos has campaigned for the Republican ticket in trips thatinclude visits to local schools, and emphasizes the need to keepstudents from dropping out and to educate the illiterate,handicapped and dyslexic to their fullest potential.   In Texas, he says, 45 percent of Hispanics don't finish highschool, while the rate for blacks is 32 percent. The nationalaverage is 28.5 percent.   While economic troubles, early marriage, drugs or alcohol areblamed for the Hispanic dropout rate, Cavazos sees those as merelysymptoms of an unraveling family structure unable to give childrenthe support and confidence they need.   ``If the family structure is tight and intact and if it valueseducation, if it really wants to see these young people move ahead;I think therein is the fundamental problem. ... If that familystructure is not a good, tight structure that supports education andencourages education and raises the vision of young people and says`Yes son, yes daughter, you will educate yourself,' ... they canfall into the social ills I talked about.''   Cavazos credits his parents _ a cattle foreman and a homemakerwho never went to college _ with encouraging their five children toget degrees. One son, Dick, became a four-star Army general, andanother, Bob, was an all-America running back who now owns a ranch.   A father of 10, Cavazos' voice fills with emotion when he recallsgraduating from Texas Tech with his bachelor's degree.   ``I was so proud, so proud, when I looked at my father when I gotmy baccalaureate degree,'' he says. ``And his pride in me when Iwent up the academic ladder there was so clear.''</TEXT></DOC>
