 Althoughthere weren't any brand-new ones, there were some changes to existingproducts and support for new hardware.andM;For example, DataTimes introduced Vaxstation 3000 and 3300 versions of itsFlash system, in addition to some other enhancements and news of features tobe added in August.andP;  Infosel probably had more changes than any other vendor,including the addition of graphics to its database, network support, OCRsoftware from Kurzweil and a Mac version.andP;  Software Consulting Services andVuText made incremental changes to their systems, while Stauffer added a Macversion and a new network.andP;  We didn't have a chance to spend time with SystemIntegrators' LASR system, but we will catch up on it at the next opportunity.andM;DataTimes offers Vaxstation systemsandM;DataTimes introduced Vaxstation 3000 and 3300 versions of its Flash newspaperlibrary system, which uses Basis software for text retrieval.andP;  (DataTimeslicenses and supports Basis under an agreement with Information DimensionsInc.)andM;Basis is a free-text searching, code-driven system that can be interfaced tomajor front-end systems.andP;  Indexing is automatic with manual enhancements ondemand, with 22 indexing options.andP;  Any field in the newspaper header can besearched and indexed, with words to be excluded (pronouns, conjunctions,articles, prepositions, etc.) included on a stop list.andM;Although the current Basis software has no prioritizing, the next version,due for release in August, will allow stories to be listed according to thenumber of occurrences of a given search criterion in a particular article.andM;A newspaper can specify searches through fields in its headers, eitherindividually or in groups.andP;  The searches can be driven from either menus orcommands.andP;  Search aids include Boolean logic, truncated root words, and affixsearching.andP;  Proximity searching, string searching and wildcard searches areavailable, as is the ability to scroll through stories displaying contextonly where search terms occur.andP;  Search criteria can also be saved for furtheruse.andM;Purging of stories is either automatic or manual, depending on a newspaper'srequirements.andP;  Currently there is no synonym searching, although plurals andpossessive occurrences of a word are identified.andP;  Stories can be cut andpasted as straight ASCII text into the editorial front end, and storage ofthe library is either on the workstation itself or on an online CD-Rom.andM;Thc company also provides news information and business databases tosubscribers worldwide.andM;Infosel handies photos, LAN and MacandM;The Mexican firm Infosel demonstrated a greatly upgraded version of itsInfodex story archiver and search engine.andP;  This system, developed for thehighly computerized El Norte newspaper of Monterey, Mexico, is an impressive,relatively inexpensive (under $5,000 to get started) news clipping databasethat can be adapted to other archiving and retrieval purposes as well.andM;The center of the system is a keyword indexing system that can speedilyprocess any text story entered.andP;  This indexing may be operated manually orset to automatically process text files, whether they were captured from wireservices, a word processor or an OCR scanner.andP;  The basic system is solid,impressively fast, and runs on off-the-shelf PC hardware.andP;  The search enginecomes in both English and Spanish versions.andP;  It supports 1.2GB optical discs,with each '3 86 PC able to support 66 of these drives, for a total storage of80 GB per PC.andM;Infosel has enhanced die product by offering some impressive extendedfeatures.andP;  It announced Infodex Photography, a database management system forhigh-resolution digitized photographs, either monochrome or color, negativeor positive.andP;  Keywords can be assigned to the images, which are stored eitheron the system's hard disk or on an optical disc.andP;  Graphics are input using acommon scanner, although at ANPA the Imapro one was used.andP;  Remote operatorscan search the graphics database via modem.andP;  The system wiU convert TIFFfiles to fax format and transfer them to a remote device.andM;Currently the database supports both TIFF and Targa formats.andP;  The company hasdeveloped its own compression algorithms for storing pictorial data, claiming20:1 compression for TIFF files and 15:1 compression for Targa files.andM;The system is thesaurus-driven and will index four different sons ofdata.andO;Graphic images can be assigned keywords and the system supports auser-definable dictionary with extensive synonym and notation capabilities,so images can carry a short abstract to which the system refers duringsearches.andP;  Each image can be given as many as 40 keywords as well as theabstract.andM;Another new feature is support for a local area network, in this case anyNetBios-compatible LAN (Novell, 3Com or IBM).andP;  For the local network, itstores data on a 1.2-GB optical disc.andP;  Remote dial-up services were alsobeing shown, and we dialed into the main database in Monterey.andM;Infosel demonstrated a new intelligent OCR interface that was developed inconjunction with Kurzweil.andP;  Serving as a means of text input to the database,it uses artificial intelligence to recognize type styles and sizes.andP;  It wasshown configured with a Canon scanner but any similar device could be used.andM;The OCR software stores scanned data as ASCII or TIFF image files.andP;  Thesoftware recognizes styles and sizes to 48 points and is available in variouslanguages, including French, Spanish, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German andEnglish.andP;  We tested the svstem on a standard newspaper clipping and itperformed reasonably well.andM;Another extension to the Infosel product range is Infosel Mac, which allowsthe user to access the PC-based database using the Mac through a commoninterface.andM;Infosel was also demonstrating administrative and billing software for thosewho might want to create their own payper-play, information services.andM;Infosel announced that an OS/2 version of its product is expected toward theend of the year.andM;SCS enhances Personal LibrarianandM;Personal Librarian is Software Consulting Services' information retrievalsystem.andP;  This is a full-text automatic indexing library system, unique inthat it has relevance ranking.andP;  The system will list retrieved articlesaccording to the frequency of words based on weighted averages.andP;  How welleach story meets the search criteria is illustrated on a bar chart.andM;The system now features a form search for ctsomplex queries and offers afilter program between the front end and the library using the headerinformation.andP;  Documents can be tied together using Hypertext links underWindows or through coding on the DOS version.andP;  There is a user-definable stoplist, but no synonym searching.andM;The system also features an expand function, which will retrieve words thathave been statistically relevant to the requested search words or subjects.andO;Boolean operators and truncated searches are supported, as are proximity,wildcard and range searching.andM;The Personal Librarian runs on AT-class machines, '386 PCs and Vaxes.andO;Databases are stored on the hard disk or on CD-ROM.andM;Stauffer supports Mac, new networkandM;The Stauffer Gold library system, supporting PCs and Macs, was shown withfaster copying of data to 200-MB optical discs, remote access, a new loggingfeature and a new network.andP;  The Mac version supports scanners, fax modems,color monitors and large screens.andP;  It can be networked using LocalTalk orPhoneNet and can be interfaced to most front ends.andP;  The user running the Macversion with MultiFinder can cut and paste between the library system and theeditorial system.andM;Both the Mac and PC versions include full text indexing and searching, with aselective vocabulary for quick search, searching with Boolean operators,proximity and wildcard searching.andP;  An additional feature is categorydefinition, which lets the user group stories.andM;At ANPA, Stauffer was also scanning stories using Omnipage software as ameans of input and indexing.andM;Also available was the Stauffer newspaper business software running on theATandamp;T Unix system.andM;VuText shows editing subsystemandM;Owned by Knight- Ridder, VuText supplies the SAVE electronic library systemconsisting of hill-text retrieval software and hardware with one of threeenvironments: ATandamp;T Unix, DEC VMS or '3 86 Unix.andM;The system interfaces to the newspaper front ends and intercepts thetypesetter queue so that library staff can pick and choose the stories theyinclude in the morgue.andP;  The newspaper can define its user interface; VuTexthandles all navigational aspects of the system.andM;Indexing is manual or automatic and uses a stop list that is alsouser-definable.andM;Searches can be in natural language, using Boolean operators, wildcards andproximity, searches and now can be fisted for historical reference.andP;  There isalso a thesaurus with userdefinable synonym listings.andP;  Search sets can becombined using the historical search listings.andM;A new feature in New Orleans was an editing subsystem that allows the user tochoose the stories from the list of those meeting the search criteria,without having to modify the search.andM;Other additions shown at ANPA were access to the dictionary using word stemsand automatic updating of the databases by date, for information managementat die database level.andP;  There is also a remote feature for accessing otherservices and newspapers' databases.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
