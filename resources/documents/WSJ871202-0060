The three Hunt trusts control a vast array of corporate and real estate holdings that constitute some of the remnants of the fortune bequeathed to Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar Hunt by their late father, oilman H.L. Hunt. Among other things, the trusts hold Placid Oil Co., a big independent energy producer, and Penrod Drilling Co., which operates one of the world's largest offshore drilling fleets.    Last year, Placid Oil and the William Herbert Hunt Trust Estate filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code while devising a plan to pay their debts. The bankruptcy-court filings were an attempt to stave off foreclosure proceedings by bank creditors of Placid and Penrod who claimed that the two companies had defaulted on $1.5 billion in loans. After the banks and the Hunts failed to come to terms on restructuring the loans last year, the brothers filed suit in federal district court here charging 22 U.S. and foreign lenders with breach of contract, bad faith and fraud, among other things.    That suit is still pending. Meanwhile, yesterday's action placed the trusts of Nelson Bunker and Lamar under the protection of the bankruptcy court. In a statement, the Hunt brothers contended that the filings &quot;were made to expedite and clarify the reorganization process,&quot; and to head off court jurisdictional issues involved in reorganizing William Herbert's trust.    But attorneys for the Hunts' lenders disagreed. They accused the Hunts of trying to tie up the proceedings in legal knots, hoping for further delays. They argue that the Hunt entities are so hopelessly insolvent that it's unlikely that the energy companies will be able to pay back the banks over time. &quot;They continue to use this as an overall delay strategy,&quot; said Hugh M. Ray, a lawyer for Manufacturers Hanover Corp. &quot;This is the most ungracious way to go broke; you do it in dribs and drabs.&quot;    Earlier this year, a bankruptcy court filing showed that the Hunts' energy and real estate empire was deeply in the hole. Assets of Placid, Penrod and trust-held real estate totaled about $1.03 billion while debts totaled about $2.42 billion. Since then, asset values have strengthened, but the Hunt empire remains badly bruised from the slump in real estate values in the Southwest and in energy prices worldwide.    Placid Oil and William Herbert's trust have been trying to frame a plan to reoganize the two entities and emerge from bankrutpcy-law proceedings. But bank creditors, led by Manufacturers Hanover and First RepublicBank Corp. have battled their plans at nearly every turn. Basically, the Hunts want to keep control of their corporate and trust entities and pay off their debt over several years. The banks oppose the plan, mostly because they want tighter control and collateral covering William Herbert Hunt's trust, and more immediate repayment of their loans.    Last week, George F. McElreath, an assistant U.S. trustee handling the bankrutpcy-law proceedings for William Herbert Hunt's trust, told the bankruptcy court that the Hunts may have trouble getting their reorganization plan for that trust approved. Among other things, he said the plan wasn't complete and that the Hunts' proposed reorganization of the trust's holdings -- a complex plan that would involve the other two trusts as well -- wasn't fully explained.    The Hunts said that yesterday's filings would allow for a less complicated reorganization of William Herbert's trust and the holdings held jointly by all three trusts. A federal bankruptcy judge has scheduled hearings for Friday to review the latest petitions.    The Hunts also said that the filings wouldn't affect Placid Oil's bankruptcy-law proceedings. A Hunt spokesman added that lawyers considered placing Penrod Drilling into bankruptcy-court proceedings, but decided against it.    The filing for Nelson Bunker Hunt's trust didn't disclose its total assets and liabilities. However, debts to the top 20 unsecured creditors are less than $100,000, mostly to vendors in Anchorage, Alaska, where the trust has significant real estate holdings, according to the filing. Other trust assets included energy properties in nine states and interests in ranches in three states. Bunker Hunt has other substantial personal holdings, including horse farms and other real estate holdings.    Lamar Hunt, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs football team, indicated that his trust's total liabilities are $783 million, but didn't give a value for the trust's assets. </TEXT></DOC>
