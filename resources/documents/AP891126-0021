Covey knows from his own bitterexperience what can happen when computer users ignore ethicalstandards of behavior.   ``I've lost hours because of viruses or computer mischief of oneform or another over the years,'' says Covey, director of theCenter for Design of Educational Computing at Carnegie MellonUniversity in Pittsburgh.   Now, he is helping plan a National Science Foundation conferencefor computer scientists and philosophers to discuss ethicalquestions posed by the explosive growth of computer technology.   According to Covey and other experts, increased concern over thesecurity of their own computer files has helped spur universityfaculty members and students across the country to pay more seriousattention to issues of computer ethics.   This has resulted in more campus lectures, symposiums, workshopsand entire courses devoted to ethical and social implications ofcomputing.   Key ethical questions include privacy of computer-storedinformation, effects of computerization on the distribution ofpower in society, liability for malfunctions in computer programsand the creation of malicious software such as computer viruses.   Joseph Turner, chairman of the Computer Science AccreditationCommission, estimates that half the 80 colleges and universitieswith computer science programs accredited by his organization offercomputer ethics courses _ up from about 10 percent five years ago.   ``It's very definitely on the increase,'' said Turner, chairmanof the computer science department at South Carolina's ClemsonUniversity.   The risks of computer abuse were dramatized in November 1988when a Cornell University graduate student unleashed a computer``worm'' into the Internet electronic network. About 6,000computers connected to the network were paralyzed.   The worm's creator, Robert Tappan Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md.,has been indicted under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Actand is to go on trial Nov. 29 in Syracuse, N.Y.   At the urging of a university panel that investigated the Morriscase, Cornell's computing board this fall adopted a statement ofprinciples for faculty, staff and students.   ``The use of computers and network systems in no way exempts youfrom the normal requirements of ethical behavior in the CornellUniversity community,'' the statement says. It calls on allcomputer users to respect the privacy of other users' data, theownership of proprietary software and the procedures established tomanage computer systems.   Buck BloomBecker, director of the National Center for ComputerCrime Data, a non-profit research institute based in Los Angeles,said that recently ``I've seen a lot more talking about the needfor ethics. ... Some of the people who are doing the talking aretaking action.''   Part of the reason, he said, is that ``more faculty members andstudents are being victimized by computer crime, because of thingslike viruses. And that makes the topic less academic and moregripping to them.''   But despite such increased attention to computer ethics,BloomBecker said, ``it's still just a drop in the bucket.''   ``One of the hard facts that we have to confront is that a lotof people think that science and business work a lot better if youdon't hamper them with ethics,'' he said.   A group of academic specialists met Nov. 1 in suburbanArlington, Va., to draft plans for an August 1991 computer ethicsconference expected to involve 300 to 500 computer professionals,philosophers, social scientists, public policymakers and businesspeople.   Planning for the conference is being carried out under a grantfrom the Ethics and Values Studies Program of the National ScienceFoundation, a federal agency that distributes research grants.   The head of the planning group, Terrell W. Bynum, director ofthe Research Center on Computing and Society at SouthernConnecticut State University in New Haven, said the gathering wouldmark ``the first international congress for integrating humanvalues into computing.''   Deborah G. Johnson, a philosopher at Rensselaer PolytechnicInstitute in Troy, N.Y., said the amount of substantivecommunication going on now between computer professionals andphilosophers is still fairly limited.   ``There's no incentive for computer scientists to worry aboutthis,'' she said. ``They don't get any credit for being worriedabout the social impacts. They're supposed to publish technicalpapers. And philosophers have the same emphasis. They're notsupposed to dirty their hands by dealing in the real world. They'resupposed to publish abstract, theoretical papers that have nothingto do with anything real.''   Ms. Johnson said a textbook she wrote on computer ethics isbeing used this academic year at 93 colleges and universities _approximately double the number of schools which utilized it lastyear.   Institutions that offer courses dealing with computer ethics andthe social implications of computing include Carnegie Mellon;Clemson; Southern Connecticut State; Rensselaer Polytechnic; theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.; StanfordUniversity, Palo Alto, Calif.; the University of Californiacampuses at Berkeley and Irvine; Northeastern University, Boston,and the University of Washington, Seattle;   At Carnegie Mellon, Covey said a major question facing thecomputing profession is, ``How do you bring about the kind ofinstitutionalized awareness that you see today in medical ethics?''   ``If you look back 20 years, when that area was really in a veryformative stage, philosophers and medical professionals were verywary of each other. It's come a long way since then,'' he said.   Covey, chairman of the American Philosophical Association'sCommittee on Computer Use in Philosophy, said that up to now hebelieves there has been ``real timidity about bringing the hammerof justice down ... on hackers who abuse the system.''   ``I think that when damage is caused _ in terms of person-hourslost, property lost, work lost _ it ought to be treated just likethe case of arson or breaking and entering, where there are actualand measurable harms,'' he said. ``It's perfectly analogous to ifsomebody broke into your office and destroyed or stole paperfiles.''</TEXT></DOC>
