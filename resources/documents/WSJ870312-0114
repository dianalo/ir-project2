Kirk Jr., the national chairman of the Democratic Party, yesterday described to the National Press Club an eight-point code of conduct for the party's 1988 presidential candidates. He hopes they won't engage in the kind of &quot;bashing&quot; and &quot;trashing&quot; of each other that, in his view, marred the party's image during the 1984 primary campaigns. His remarks seemed to be aimed mainly at Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who were especially outspoken in 1984 in their attacks on Walter Mondale as a captive of special and traditional interests. &quot;My memory of the 1984 nomination is one of self-inflicted wounds,&quot; said the party chairman in describing all the intramural warfare that went on. The party's chances suffered, he believes. Prospective 1988 candidates seem to be lining up behind their chairman, promising to be nicer to one another out on the stump. If, as seems unlikely, this promise is fulfilled, we wonder if anyone has thought about how much the party will suffer from public boredom. </TEXT></DOC>
