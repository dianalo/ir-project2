Background</ITAG>This section provides the legislative and regulatory background for thefinal rule, describes the comprehensive underground storage tank (UST)regulatory program, and summarizes today's financial responsibility rulemaking.A. Legislative and Regulatory Background of the RuleThe Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) extended and strengthenedthe provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). HSWAcreated Subtitle I, which provides for the development and implementationof a regulatory program for underground storage tanks (USTs) \1\<NOTE/> containing regulated substances, including petroleum \2\<NOTE/> and other regulated substances \3\<NOTE/> (such nonpetroleum regulated substances are hereinafter referredto as hazardous substances). Section 9003(a) of Subtitle I requires theEPA Administrator to promulgate requirements for release detection, preventionand correction as necessary to protect human health and the environment.These technical standards were promulgated at 53 FR 37082 (September 23,1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Under section 9001(1) ``underground storage tank'' isdefined as ``any one or combination of tanks (including underground pipesconnected thereto) which is used to contain an accumulation of regulatedsubstances, and the volume of which (including the volume of the undergroundpipes connected thereto) is 10 percent or more beneath the surface of theground.

Theseterms are further defined by regulation under the technical standards publishedat (CITE-TS).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under section 9001(8), petroleum is defined as ``petroleum,including crude oil or any fraction thereof,'' which is liquid at standardconditions of temperature (60 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure (14.7 poundsper square inch absolute).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Under section 9001(2), ``regulated substances'' are definedas ``(A) any substance defined in section 101(4) of the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (but not including anysubstance regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C), and (B) petroleum.''The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) amendedsections 9003 (c) and (d) of Subtitle I to mandate that the Agency establishfinancial responsibility requirements for UST owners and operators to assurethe costs of corrective action and third-party liability caused by suddenand nonsudden accidental releases from USTs. SARA made other changes toSubtitle I affecting financial responsibility. <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) It established $1 million per occurrence and an appropriate annualaggregate as the minimum assurance levels for USTs at facilities engagedin petroleum production, refining, or marketing, and for USTs which handlesubstantial amounts of petroleum; the Administrator may set lower per-occurrencelimits for USTs at other types of facilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) It authorized the Administrator to suspend enforcement of thefinancial responsibility requirements if financial assurance for a particularclass or category of USTs is ``not generally available'' and steps arebeing taken to either form a risk retention group (RRG) or establish astate fund pursuant to andSection;9004(c)(1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) It created a $500 million Leaking UST Trust Fund to fund certaincorrective action costs for petroleum releases (including the costs ofcleanup, enforcement and cost recovery).\4\<NOTE/> Before the effective date of today's rule, Trust Fund moniescan be used whenever the Administrator or state under cooperative agreementdetermines that such action is necessary to protect human health and theenvironment and when there is no owner or operator capable or willing toundertake proper action. Priority must be given to cases posing the greatestthreat to human health and the environment. After the effective date oftoday's rule, the circumstances under which Trust Fund monies may be usedare more restricted (see Section IV.B). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\The Trust Fund may not be used to compensate third parties.On April 17, 1987, the Agency proposed financial responsibility requirementsfor USTs containing petroleum (52 FR 12786). The Agency provided a 60-daycomment period and extended it for an additional 30 days. In addition,the Agency published two Supplemental Notices modifying the initial proposal(52 FR 48638, December 23, 1987, and 53 FR 10401, March 31, 1988). Basedon EPA's analysis of the comments, EPA has revised the rule and is todaypromulgating a final rule, which is summarized in Section C below. EPA has also issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) onfinancial responsibility requirements for USTs containing hazardous substances(53 FR 3818, February 9, 1988). B. The Comprehensive Federal UST Regulatory Program In addition to this financial responsibility rule for USTs containing petroleum,the Agency has promulgated technical standards for USTs containing petroleumand hazardous substances (53 FR 37082, September 23, 1988) and proceduresfor approval of state UST programs (53 FR 37212, September 23, 1988). Thethree rulemakings together establish a comprehensive program to regulateUSTs, as required by Subtitle I of RCRA. The technical standards require UST owners and operators to meet standardsfor tank operation and design, release detection and reporting, correctiveaction, and closure. The operation and design standards require that USTsbe protected from corrosion and equipped with devices to prevent spillsand overfills. The release detection and reporting standards require ownersand operators to install leak detection systems and report actual and suspectedreleases. These requirements pertain to new USTs on the effective dateof the rule. Some operational requirements pertain to USTs currently inuse on the effective date. USTs currently in use become subject to thetank operation and design requirements over a ten-year phase-in periodand the release detection requirements over a five-year phase-in period.The corrective action standards, which apply to all tanks on the effectivedate, require owners and operators to clean up releases from UST systems.In the short run, one effect of the technical standards will be to increasedetection of releases; over the long run, the standards will reduce thelikelihood that new releases will occur. The financial responsibility rule requires that UST owners or operatorsdemonstrate financial responsibility for the costs of corrective actionand compensation of third parties arising from release of petroleum fromunderground storage tanks. The financial responsibility requirements willhelp ensure that owners and operators can respond promptly to clean upreleases and to compensate third parties for any injuries or damages associatedwith the releases. Because the providers of financial assurance mechanismsmay require UST owners and operators to install leak detection and corrosionprotection systems as a condition of coverage, the financial responsibilityrequirements may accelerate compliance with the technical standards. The state program approval objectives (53 FR 37212, September 23, 1988)enable states whose programs are no less stringent than the federal programand which provide for adequate enforcement of compliance to administerthe UST regulatory program. EPA has designed the approval criteria to provideflexibility consistent with statutory requirements to encourage statesto adopt the UST program. EPA believes that regulation of the large andvaried UST population is best implemented by state and local agencies,which can oversee and enforce the UST program more effectively than EPA.Finally, the last major component of the federal UST regulatory program,establishing financial responsibility requirements for USTs containinghazardous substances, will be proposed in the future. C. Program Objectives and Summary of Today's Rule <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Program Objectives and Major Changes in the Final Rule</ITAG>The Agency had three guiding objectives in considering the comments receivedon the proposed rule and in adopting the changes for the final rule. First,the financial responsibility program for petroleum USTs must require adequateand reliable financial assurance for the costs of UST releases, based onthe following considerations:(1) The certainty that funds will be available;(2) The sufficiency of funds to cover the costs of releases; and(3) The availability of funds for corrective action and third-party liability.Second, while requiring adequate and reliable financial assurances, therule must provide flexibility, where possible, to increase the feasibilityof compliance by the regulated community. Subtitle I specifically allowsflexibility in establishing per-occurrence levels of assurance for USTsat facilities not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing,and for aggregate levels of assurance. The Agency has carefully consideredwhere to allow flexibility in the financial responsibility program whileensuring adequate protection for covering the costs of petroleum UST releases.Finally, to the extent possible, this rule should promote expansion ofexisting assurance mechanisms and development of new ones to achieve maximumcompliance by UST owners and operators. The Agency recognizes the currentlimited availability of financial assurance mechanisms and the difficultymany owners and operators will have in complying with the requirements,at least initially. However, insurance coverage is available now to someUST owners and operators, and a number of states have either adopted orare taking steps to adopt state funds. The Agency has constructed the finalrule to promote timely compliance by all owners and operators and to encouragedevelopment of additional assurance mechanisms. The major changes in the rule and the way in which they further these objectivesare summarized below:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Phased schedule of compliance. </T3>The final rule phases in compliancein four stages for different categories of UST owners. The Agency has adoptedthis approach to allow adequate time for compliance and to promote developmentof financial assurance mechanisms in the following ways:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Owners most able to comply, based on financial strength, must doso 3 months after the promulgation date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Most owners in the next two groups have or can obtain insurance.The phase-in allows time for processing insurance applications (which maytake several months per application). It also provides time for insuranceproviders to conform their policies to the requirements of this rule, aswell as to decide whether to extend their policies to new segments of theregulated community. Some owners in these groups may also be able to relyon state funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Owners scheduled for compliance 24 months after the date of promulgationof the rule, e.g., single station owners and non-marketers, will rely primarilyon state funds and expansion of insurance and RRGs beyond currently availableprograms. The schedule provides time for these mechanisms to become available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Phasing in compliance also provides UST owners and operators timeto invest in technical improvements or replacement of tanks to make theminsurable, as well as to comply with the UST technical standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>$500,000 per occurrence level of assurance allowed for non-marketerswith monthly throughput of 10,000 gallons of gasoline or less. </T3>TheAgency has determined that this amount should be sufficient to cover about99 percent of all claims at these facilities_a key criterion in decidingthe coverage amounts. At the same time, this lower coverage amount reducesthe burden on individual owners or operators. In addition, allowing a lowerlevel of assurance may increase the number of policies insurers are ableto write and may provide an incentive to extend coverage to non-marketers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Lower aggregate level of assurance. </T3>The final rule requires amaximum aggregate of $2 million and raises the number of tanks qualifyingfor the $1 million aggregate to 100. These aggregate levels achieve theAgency's goal that releases at UST facilities not exceed the aggregatemore than one percent of the time. At the same time, the lower levels significantlyreduce the burden on owners and operators. More firms will be able to useexisting insurance programs (which currently provide maximum aggregatecoverage of $2 million). The lower aggregate will also make it easier tocapitalize RRGs and state funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Suspension of enforcement. </T3>Today's rule does not contain suspensionof enforcement procedures. The Agency has chosen to defer the promulgationof these procedures. The Agency hopes to gain experience with implementationof the program on which to base a process that minimizes the administrativeburden of suspension of enforcement on owners and operators as well ason the Agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Summary of Today's Rule</ITAG>This section briefly summarizes EPA's financial responsibility rule forpetroleum USTs. Section III of this preamble describes the final rule,some of the major comments that were made on the proposed rule, and therationale for the changes. The Comment/Response Document (``Summary ofComments and EPA's Response to Comments on the April 17, 1987, ProposedFinancial Responsibility Rule for Petroleum Underground Storage Tanks'')in the docket contains a detailed summary of all comments on the proposedrule and the Agency's response to those comments.Today's financial responsibility requirements are applicable to ownersor operators of ``petroleum UST systems'' with the following exceptions:(1) Federal or state entities that own or operate USTs containing petroleum;and (2) owners and operators of USTs excluded from the technical standards(Section III.A.6 below). For purposes of covering costs of corrective actionand third-party liability, EPA requires all owners or operators of petroleumUSTs at facilities engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketingand owners or operators of USTs with an average monthly throughput of morethan 10,000 gallons to obtain financial assurance of at least $1 millionper occurrence. Owners or operators of USTs at facilities not engaged inpetroleum production, refining, or marketing with an average monthly throughputof 10,000 gallons or less must maintain financial assurance of at least$500,000 per occurrence. All owners or operators must maintain an annualaggregate of $1 million or $2 million, depending on the number of USTsassured.UST owners or operators may satisfy the requirements using the followingmechanisms: insurance or risk retention group coverage, surety bond, guarantee,letter of credit, financial test of self-insurance, trust fund, a state-requiredmechanism, or a state fund or other state assurance. Mechanisms can beused alone or in combination to cover the costs of taking corrective actionand compensating third parties as long as a mechanism or combination ofmechanisms provides the appropriate amount of assurance. The only combinationof mechanisms that is not allowed is the financial test of self-insuranceand a guarantee where the financial statements of the owner or operatorand the guarantor are consolidated.The final rule does not contain procedures for obtaining a suspension ofenforcement of the requirements. The Agency will promulgate suspensionof enforcement procedures at a later date.The final rule requires owners or operators to submit documentation offinancial responsibility to the implementing agency after a known or suspectedrelease occurs; when a provider becomes incapable of providing assurance;and when a provider revokes a mechanism and the owner or operator is unableto obtain alternate coverage. Owners or operators must also submit documentationof financial responsibility if requested by the implementing agency. Inaddition, UST owners or operators must notify the implementing agency oftheir methods of demonstrating financial responsibility upon installationof new tanks. Owners or operators must maintain records of the financialassurance mechanisms used to satisfy these requirements on-site or at theirplace of business. The final rule also requires that UST owners or operators receive a noticeof cancellation before terminating coverage to allow them sufficient timeto procure alternate assurance and to determine whether there are existingreleases. Owners and operators must comply with these financial responsibility requirementsover a phased-in compliance period lasting up to 24 months from the promulgationdate of this rule. The state program approval objective for financial responsibility of ownersand operators of petroleum UST systems is also promulgated today. Thisobjective outlines the financial responsibility requirements that ownersand operators of petroleum UST systems must meet in order to be ``no lessstringent'' than the corresponding federal technical standard, and to demonstrateadequate enforcement of compliance. D. Availability of Mechanisms The Agency received many comments suggesting that the mechanisms allowedto demonstrate compliance with today's rule are generally unavailable.The Agency recognizes that, for several reasons, including cost, companysize, or lack of qualified providers, some of the mechanisms proposed inthe rule might have a limited availability at this time. Some mechanisms,such as surety bonds and letters of credit, are likely to be availableand affordable to only a few owners and operators. However, in decidingto allow a wide variety of mechanisms to be used to demonstrate financialresponsibility, the Agency did not want to preclude the use of any mechanismthat might be used and that would provide an adequate degree of assurancethat funds will be available if needed. The guarantee, for example, wasincluded because some UST owners and operators have business relationshipswith firms who might be willing and able to provide them guarantees. Notall owners and operators, however, will have that option. The Agency recognizes that insurance and state financial assurance programsare likely to be the most feasible mechanisms for most owners and operatorsto comply with today's rule. Currently, however, pollution liability insurancefor USTs is not widely available for a number of reasons. Foremost is thefact that such pollution liability insurance is now and is likely to continueto be offered by a limited number of specialized providers. Second is theunpredictability of the risks involved for unprotected tanks that havenot been subject to regular leak detection. In addition, it is unclearto insurers how the new UST technical requirements, especially for correctiveaction, may change the number and cost of claims. This current uncertaintyalso affects the amount of reinsurance that is available for insurancepolicies written for USTs and thereby limits the number of policies thatinsurers are able to issue. Despite its limited availability, a number of UST owners and operatorshave been able to find coverage. Commenters indicated that several insurersare already covering some USTs or are planning to offer such coverage inthe future. While a substantial number of petroleum marketers are currentlyinsured, the Agency recognizes that many smaller motor fuel marketers andUST owners not engaged in motor fuel marketing have had difficulty in obtainingcoverage. Implementation of the technical standards rule is likely to increase theavailability of insurance over the long term. As old, unprotected tanksare removed and/or fitted with release detection systems, the number ofleaks that are detected should increase significantly. As these leaks aredetected and corrected, the requirements for upgrading or replacing tanks,combined with regular monitoring, should significantly reduce both theoccurrence of leaks and their duration prior to detection. Over the longterm, implementation of the technical standards should make UST risks morepredictable and, therefore, insurers should be more willing to providecoverage. Owners and operators who cannot secure traditional insurance coverage mayalso have alternatives. For some owners and operators, RRGs will offeran alternative to insurance. One such RRG has been formed and offers coverageto petroleum marketers. Several other commenters indicated an interestin forming RRGs. State funds may also be available to UST owners and operators. In fact,Congress specifically recognized the important role that state funds mayplay in providing financial assurance by including attempts to form a statefund as a basis for suspension of enforcement and by explicitly allowingsuch funds to meet financial responsibility requirements for state programapproval under RCRA section 9004(c)(1). Although not widely available atpresent, state funds have already been established in several states. TheAgency recognizes that, in most cases, state funds may only supply a portionof the financial assurance required. Some currently available funds covercorrective action but not third-party liability costs; others cover both.Generally, these funds do not supply coverage in the full amount requiredin today's rule. State funds may need to be used in combination with othermechanisms to meet the requirements of today's rule. Depending on theirstructure, state funds can provide an important means for compliance withfinancial responsibility requirements at the onset of the program and encouragedevelopment of insurance and RRGs over the longer term. The Agency realizes that the mechanisms allowed in today's rule may bedifficult to obtain at present. However, the phased-in schedule for compliancewith the rule will provide insurers more time to develop and expand linesof insurance and states more time to establish state funds. In addition,the Agency expects to promulgate final procedures for suspension of enforcementin the near future. Following promulgation of that rule, those owners andoperators unable to obtain a financial assurance mechanism by their compliancedate may form classes and apply for a suspension of enforcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>A. Applicability (andSection; 280.90)The rule promulgated today applies to owners and operators of all undergroundstorage tank systems containing petroleum, with certain exemptions or deferrals.Commenters raised several issues concerning the applicability of this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Owners and Operators (andSection; 280.90(a))</ITAG>The final rule applies to owners and operators of all petroleum UST systems(as defined in andSection; 280.12 of the technical standards rule). If theowner and operator are separate persons, only one person is required todemonstrate financial responsibility although the Agency will hold eachresponsible if the financial responsibility requirements are not compliedwith by either party. While the Agency's intention with respect to thisissue was explicitly stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (52 FR12795, April 17, 1987), the rule also conveyed the Agency's intention byusing the phrase ``owner <T3>or </T3>operator'' instead of ``owner <T3>and </T3>operator'' in all but the applicability section.The Agency retains this approach and expliticly states it in the rule,as well as in the preamble, to avoid possible confusion. For this reason,the Agency has added the following language to andSection; 280.90 <T3>Applicability:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">If the owner and operator of a petroleum UST system are separate persons,only one person is required to demonstrate financial responsibility.</ITAG>Some commenters supported the Agency's approach to applicability when theowners and operators are separate persons; however, other commenters believedthat EPA should designate which person should comply with the rules. Ofthese commenters, some supported a rule that required only the owners tocomply with the requirements while other commenters believed only operatorsshould be held responsible. Some commenters suggested that the person withresponsibility for a particular activity, e.g. tank installation, maintenanceor daily operation, should demonstrate financial responsibility.The commenters who urged EPA to designate only one responsible person whenthe owners and operators are separate persons believed that the proposalleft owners and operators to ``fight it out'' to determine who will demonstratefinancial responsibility and that problems would occur when they do notagree who should obtain coverage. The commenters who urged EPA to holdonly operators responsible pointed out that in many cases owners will haveonly minimal or nominal control over the operation of the tanks (e.g.,passive lessors of property such as oil jobbers or marketers ordinarilydo not control day-to-day tank operations). On the other hand, one commenterwho supported holding only owners responsible pointed out that, when oiljobbers and marketers own tanks, they have usually assumed responsibilityfor tank replacement and maintenance.The Agency has decided not to designate a single party, either the owneror operator, as responsible for compliance with the rules because the statuterequires the UST standards to be applicable to ``all owners and operators,''and a determination of which person should assume these costs could onlybe made on a cases by case basis. Under the technical requirements, bothpersons are responsible for corrective action; however, the liability ofowners and operators to third-party claimants will vary depending on thecircumstances of each case and on the applicable state law. Making financialassurance the responsibility of only the person engaged in a particularactivity would also be inappropriate because the liability of an owneror operator is not limited to the results of particular activities. Insome cases the person responsible for one activity may have allowed a releaseto occur and therefore incur liability to third parties, while in anothercase, the person responsible for a different activity may be liable. Undertheories of strict liability and negligence, even passive lessors couldbe liable for third-party damages in some situations. Moreover, the personresponsible for maintenance and installation will vary depending on theindividual arrangements between owner and operator.The Agency recognizes that in some instances owners and operators willhave difficulty agreeing which one of them will comply with the rules.Nonetheless, the Agency believes that owners and operators are in the bestposition to decide between themselves, as part of their ongoing businessrelationships, which one of them should demonstrate financial responsibility.Owners and operators may decide that the person most responsible for particularactivities should obtain financial assurance, or they may decide that theperson most able to demonstrate financial responsibility should do so.EPA believes this approach will allow for greater flexibility, yet avoidsthe considerable expense of requiring both parties to secure financialassurance.Other commenters expressed concern about other applicability issues. Somecommenters objected to requiring current owners and operators to obtainfinancial assurance when past owners and operators might be responsiblefor contamination. Another commenter pointed out that tank testers maybe responsible for releases and urged that they should be subject to financialresponsibility requirements.Current owners and operators are responsible under the regulation for obtainingfinancial assurances for their tanks even if previous owners or operatorsare responsible for contamination. In situations where a current owneror operator is faced with claims for contamination that occurred undera previous owner or operator, he may pursue appropriate legal remediesagainst the previous owner or operator. Similarly, damage to tanks andreleases which result from tank testing activity are subject to tort claimsunder applicable state law. Moreover, the statute does not authorize theimposition of financial responsibility requirements on tank testers, onlyUST owners and operators.Finally, one commenter requested that the Agency clearly define ownersand operators to exclude corporate parents or affiliates. Parents and affiliatesgenerally would not be subject to today's rule. Parents, for example, mayserve as guarantors for owners and operators, thereby enabling the owneror operator to satisfy financial responsibility requirements, but wouldnot be directly responsible themselves for complying with these requirements.The Agency might, however, hold parents or affiliates subject to theserequirements in certain situations. For example, if an owner or operatorattempted to circumvent today's requirements through the creation of asham subsidiary or through other arrangements, the Agency could in appropriatecircumstances hold a parent or affiliate responsible for compliance withthese rules. Thus, a definition of owners and operators which excludescorporate parents or affiliates in all situations is not appropriate. TheAgency does not expect, however, that parents or affiliates will generallybe subject to these financial responsibility requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Tanks Taken Out of Operation Before the Date for Compliance (andSection;280.90(b))</ITAG>The preamble to the proposed rule stated EPA's intention to make the ruleapplicable to tanks taken out of operation before the effective date ofthe rule. The language of the proposed rule, however, did not state specificallythat it would apply to such tanks.The Agency received a number of comments on this provision. One commenterquestioned the Agency's authority under Subtitle I to apply financial responsibilityrequirements retroactively to owners of tanks taken out of operation beforeSubtitle I was enacted in 1984.The statutory definition of ``owner'' in RCRA section 9001(3)(A) and (B)includes owners of tanks taken out of operation before enactment of HSWA,as well as owners of tanks in used on the date of enactment. RCRA section9003(a) further authorizes EPA to promulgate regulations, including financialresponsibility regulations, applicable to all owners and operators of USTs.Therefore, the Agency has authority to regulate tanks taken out of operationbefore the enactment of Subtitle I and to impose financial responsibilityrequirements on owners and operators of such tanks where necessary to protecthuman health or the environment:Some commenters, while not questioning the Agency's statutory authority,urged the Agency to exempt tanks taken out of operation before the effectivedate of the rule or before November 8, 1985 (one year after enactment ofHSWA). Commenters gave the following reasons for such an exemption:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Providers of financial assurance are not likely to offerassurance for tanks taken out of operation unless it can be proven thatthere is no contamination present.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Because so many tanks have been taken out of operation inrecent years, it would be extremely difficult to identify these tanks andinform former owners and operators of their obligations.</ITAG>One commenter recommended that if the requirement for such tanks is retained,owners and operators of tanks that are properly closed should not be requiredto maintain financial assurance if they can demonstrate that no contaminationis present.At the time the Agency proposed to require owners or operators of tankstaken out of operation before the effective date to obtain financial assurance,it also proposed in the technical rule to require these tanks to complywith closure requirements (andSection; 280.80). The Agency reasoned that,because non-operational tanks were subject to the closure and correctiveaction requirements under Subparts F and H of the technical standards,requiring financial assurance was necessary to ensure that closure wasundertaken properly and quickly.Since that time, the Agency has decided to eliminate the requirement thatall USTs taken out of operation before the effective date for the technicalrule undergo closure. The rule does provide, however, that implementingagencies may require owners or operators to close these tanks properlyif there is a reason to believe that they may pose a threat to human healthand the environment. The preamble to the technical standards rule discussesthe reasons for this change.Based on comments on the proposed financial responsibility rule and therevisions to the technical standards, the Agency has decided not to requireowners or operators of USTs taken out of operation before the compliancedates in this rule to obtain financial assurance. The Agency recognizesthat for many owners and operators of USTs, insurance will be the onlyfeasible financial assurance mechanism available. The Agency agrees withcommenters, among them insurance companies, that insurance providers wouldbe extremely reluctant to assure tanks taken out of operation because ofthe perceived greater uncertainly associated with them.Even if providers of assurance would assure these tanks, it is unlikelythat they would cover leaks which occurred before the effective date ofthe policy. For example, based on standard insurance industry practice,owners and operators applying for coverage must meet certain pre-conditionswhich may include tank tightness testing and a determination that thereare no existing releases. If releases are discovered, insurance policiesprobably would not cover them, because the insurance industry's practiceis to exclude pre-existing releases from coverage. In addition, as a conditionfor coverage of a tank not in operation, an insurer might require properclosure in order to minimize the risk of a release of material which mightremain in the tank. Such an insurance policy would be of little value ofprotecting human health and the environment since it would not cover pre-existingconditions and would only cover tanks that have been emptied of their contents.The Agency believes that the owners' and operators' resources would bebetter spent in closure and corrective action that in attempting to procurethis type of insurance. Nevertheless, owners and operators of tanks takenout of operation before the effective date remain responsible for the costsof releases associated with them.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Applicability to State and Federal Government Entities (andSection;280.90(c))</ITAG>The final rule, like the proposed rule, is not applicable to state andfederal government entities whose debts and liabilities are the debts andliabilities of a state or the United States. Several commenters arguedthat state and federal government entities should not be exempt from thefinancial responsibility requirements. Their reasons included the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Such an exemption conflicts with Congressional intent tohave all tanks assured. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The exemption will discourage sound tank management practiceson the part of state and Federal governments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The exemption would provide state-owned transit agencieswith unfair advantages over private owners.</ITAG>The Agency does not interpret the Congressional intent of Subtitle I topreclude exempting any class of USTs from otherwise applicable requirementswhen the Agency has determined that such requirements are not necessaryto protect human health or the environment. See RCRA section 9003(a). Withrespect to financial responsibility, such requirements need not be imposedwhere the owners or operators will consistently be able to cover the costsof releases in a timely fashion. The purpose of these financial responsibilityrequirements is to ensure that funds will be available in a timely mannerto cover the costs of corrective action and compensation of third partiesarising from UST releases. While the Agency recognizes that these requirementsmay provide an incentive for sound tank management practices, this is nottheir primary purpose. No commenters disputed the Agency's opinion that Federal and state governmentshave the requisite financial strength and stability to fulfill their financialassurance obligations. In addition, exemption from the requirements willnot discourage sound tank management practices by state and federal governmententities, because they remain responsible for the cost of corrective actionassociated with the releases. The Agency concedes that not having to pay the costs of procuring a financialassurance mechanism may result in a slight competitive advantage for state-ownedtransit agencies. Such an advantage is not likely to be significantly greaterthan advantages already enjoyed by state-owned transit systems (e.g., throughgovernment subsidies). In addition, the financial advantage of the state-ownedagency is comparable to the position of any firm which can rely on a guaranteeprovided by a parent or related firm, and merely reflects the differencebetween large and small businesses. If releases occur, state-owned agenciesmay rely on state assistance to pay the costs of damages. Privately-ownedtransit agencies, however, would have to rely on their own funds to paythese costs. Thus, even without today's rule, private transit agencieshave a financial incentive to purchase insurance coverage not shared bythe state-owned agency. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Applicability to Local Government Entities </ITAG>While the proposed rule exempted from the requirements those governmententities whose debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of federalor state governments, local government entities were required to providefinancial assurance for USTs that they own or operate. The final rule remainsapplicable to local government entities. However, under the Agency's schedulefor phased compliance with the rule, local government entities have 24months from the promulgation date to comply. EPA also intends to developa financial test in the interim that will allow local governments thatcan demonstrate the requisite financial strength and stability to coverthe costs associated with UST releases to self-insure. Local government entities include both general purpose local governmentsand special purpose local entities. General purpose local government entitiesinclude municipalities, counties, townships, towns, villages, parishesand New England towns. Special purpose local governments perform a singlefunction or a limited range of functioins. Special purpose governmentsare generally designated as either public authorities or special districtssuch as school districts, water and sewer authorities, transit authoritiesor power authorities. All local governments, both general and special purpose,are subject to this rule. One commenter supported application of the financial responsibility requirementsto local government entites. However, many commenters stated that the proposedexemption for federal and state governments from demonstration of financialresponsibility should be extended to local government entities. The majorarguments in favor of such an exemption focused on three areas: (1) Thepermanence and stability of local governments; (2) the incentives for localgovernmens to provide funds in a timely manner; and (3) the financial strengthand capability to raise funds in a timely manner. First, several commenters maintained that the permanence and stabilitythat the Agency attributes to Federal and state governments also applyto local governments; local governments are unalterably attached to theirparticular location. Moreover, commenters asserted that cities almost nevergo bankrupt, and when they are unable to meet their financial obligationsover the short-term, their debts are not forgiven under the bankruptcylaws but are extended until they can be satisfied. Therefore, unlike privatefirms, local governments do not disappear even if they file bankruptcy.Second, commenters stated that local governments have the same incentivesas federal and state governments to meet their UST obligations in a timelymanner. Local governments exist to safeguard public health and welfare,and local officials have voter accountability that helps assure an immediateand effective response to an UST release. One commenter, an associationof city governments, stated that cities have consistently demonstratedan ability to respond to UST leaks in a timely manner and have taken promptaction to ensure that leaks do not recur in the future by either upgradingor removing failed USTs. Third, commenters claimed that local governments have the requisite financialstrength to meet potential UST obligations in a timely manner. One commenterrepresenting city governments pointed out that cities are accustomed toaddressing emergencies such as natural disasters and routinely establishcontingency funds of a size that could easily cover the costs associatedwith most UST leaks. Another commenter noted that local appropriation proceduresoften are structured so that officials may take fund originally intendedfor one purpose and divert them to a more pressing need related to USTs.Finally, one commenter argued that for UST releases in excess of fund reserves,many local government entities_like states_have the ability to raise fundsthrough taxes and debt issues. The commenter stated that the delays involvedwith tax and bond initiatives are unlikely to affect the timeliness ofan UST cleanup because cities tend to be excellent credit risks and canoften have contracted work performed in an emergency without having toprovide funds until after the emergency is remedied or use their own personnelto respond. The Agency believes that there is merit in many of the points commentersraised as applied to particular municipalities. However, for several reasons,the Agency is unwilling to exempt all local government entities from theserequirements. There is substantial variability in local governments interms of size, financial capacity, and functions. A number of commentersurged that the financial test should be modified so that local governmententities could use it. The corporate financial test is not applicable tomost government entities because it contains a net worth indicator, a financialmeasure that is either unavailable to many local governments or does notmeasure financial strength in the same way it does for private firms. Itrequires reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)or to Dun and Bradstreet, which is also not applicable to government entities.Accordingly, the Agency is taking steps to develop a financial test thatwill allow local governments meeting the test criteria to self-insure likeprivate companies that use the corporate financial test. Local governmentswhich pass this financial test will not be required to obtain other financialassurance mechanisms to comply with the requirements of this rule. In theinterim as discussed in Section III.B, under the phased schedule of compliance,the compliance date for local government entities is 24 months after promulgation.The Agency anticipates that the final financial test for local governmententities will be promulgated before their scheduled compliance date. Some commenters on the proposed rule suggested that particular specialpurpose local governments such as public power entities or airports shouldbe exempt from the financial responsibility requirments. The Agency seesno reason to treat particular special purpose local government entitiesdifferently from all other local governments. All local governments remainsubject to the rule and may be able to meet the local government financialtest under development. Some commenters suggested a change to the corporate financial test so thatpower authorities meeting the other criteria in the test could use it.Specifically, they suggested that the Agency accept reports to the RuralElectrification Administration and the Energy Information Administration,as an alternative to filing with the SEC or Dun and Bradstreet. Their commentsindicated that other than filing annual statements with a different Agency,they could use the Subtitle I corporate financial test. This change hasbeen made to the corporate financial test so that power authorities meetingthe criteria in the test may use. it. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Applicability to Indian Tribes </ITAG>The proposed rule did not address the applicability of the financial responsibilityrequirements to Indian tribes. Indian tribes are included in the statutorydefinition of municipalities in RCRA Section 1004(13). Accordingly, underthe phased schedule of compliance, Indian tribes will be required to complywith financial responsibility requirements on the last compliance date,24 months after the promulgation date of the rule, similar to municipalities.However, in the proposed financial test for local government entities,the Agency will specifically request comments on whether this test shouldapply to Indian tribes. The Agency intends to finalize this proposed rulebefore the compliance date for local government entities and Indian tribes.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Deferrals and Exclusions (andSection; 280.90(d))</ITAG>Under the proposed rule, EPA would have deferred from the financial responsibilityrequirements certain categories of tanks that the Agency also was proposingto defer under the technical requirements. The Agency proposed to deferthe regulation of these categories of USTs because it had limited informationabout these USTs or was otherwise uncertain about the need to regulatethem. Several commenters addressed these and other categories of tanksthat they believed should be deferred or exempted from the final rule.The proposed technical requirements deferred the following categories oftanks from all of their requirements (except the requirements for correctiveaction and notification and the prohibition of bare steel UST installationrequirements): (1) Wastewater treatment tanks, (2) sumps, (3) undergroundbulk storage tanks, (4) USTs containing radioactive waste and other radioactivematerials, (5) UST systems containing electrical equipment, (6) hydrauliclift tanks, and (7) UST systems containing used oil.In the final technical standards rule (53 FR 37082, September 23, 1988),the Agency has excluded some of these categories of USTs from the technicalrequirements. Some of the other categories of USTs that the Agency proposedto defer from regulation are now regulated. The Agency continues to deferregulating certain categories of USTs (except from corrective action requirementsand prohibition of bare steel UST installation).The financial responsibility rule tracks the final technical standardsrule with respect to exclusions and deferrals from the requirements. AllUSTs excluded from regulation are excluded from these financial responsibilityrequirements. All USTs that are deferred from regulation also are not subjectto these financial responsibility requirements. Because the Agency is uncertainabout the need to regulate deferred categories of USTs, or has limitedinformation about them, the application of financial responsibility requirementsto the deferred categories of USTs is inappropriate at this point. TheAgency's decision about the regulation of each of the categories of excludedor deferred tanks is summarized below. The preamble to the final technicalstandards rule contains a thorough discussion of the Agency's rationalefor each decision.<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>UST Systems Containing Hazardous Waste and Regulated Substances. </T3>TheAgency has excluded these tank systems from regulation under Subtitle I.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>UST Systems Containing Electrical Equipment and Hydraulic Lifts. </T3>Equipmentor machinery using regulated substances for operational purposes are nowexcluded from regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Wastewater Treatment USTs. </T3>Wastewater treatment tanks regulatedunder the Clean Water Act are excluded from regulation.

They are now subject to the final technical rule,and are also subject to the financial responsibility requirement.</ITAG>For each of the following categories of tanks, the Agency received commentssupporting a deferral or exemption of these requirements from the financialresponsibility requirements (see also the preamble to the technical standardsrule for a more thorough discussion): <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Small Capacity Tanks</T3>. One commenter urged ``special consideration''for small capacity users. One commenter suggested that petroleum USTs containingunder 5,000 gallons should be exempt. Another commenter suggested 4,000gallons as a cutoff. As noted above, the Agency has decided on a <T3>de minimis</T3> exclusion for tanks with a capacity of less than 110gallons. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Small Business</T3>. One commenter requested a small business cutofffor the final rules because insurance may be offered only at unaffordablerates. Other commenters requested an exemption for small businesses notengaged in petroleum marketing. The Agency has not exempted small businessesfrom the final financial responsibility requirements because the costsof corrective action and third-party claims will not be different for smallbusinesses than for other owners and operators. The specific concerns ofsmall businesses and businesses not engaged in petroleum marketing areaddressed in establishing a phased compliance schedule (Section III.B inthe preamble) and a lower peroccurrence amount for certain facilities notengaged in petroleum production, refining or marketing (Section III.D.1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Tanks Containing Heating Oil</T3>. Based on experience with releasesin New Jersey, one commenter urged that heating oil for on-site consumptionshould not be excluded from the requirements. Because heating oil tanksare excluded from regulation by statute, EPA cannot require these USTsto obtain coverage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Small Throughput Tanks</T3>. One commenter supported exempting a systemwith small throughput volume. According to this commenter, this exemptionis appropriate because most leaks are associated with piping. The Agencyrecognizes that a large number of releases are associated with piping;however, the Agency does not believe an exclusion for these tanks is appropriate.Releases may still occur from tanks with small throughput and owners oroperators should obtain coverage for releases that do occur. However, theAgency has taken these concerns into account in establishing a lower pre-occurrenceamount of financial assurance for tanks at certain facilities not engagedin petroleum production, refining, or marketing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Tanks Owned by Small, Rural Telephone Systems</T3>. One commenter urgedEPA to consider exempting small, rural telephone systems from these requirementsfor the following reasons: (1) The unavailability of pollution insurance,(2) the high net worth requirement for self-insurance, and (3) the highper-occurrence and aggregate coverage levels. Although EPA recognizes ownersand operators of these USTs may have difficulty obtaining financial assurances,releases from these USTs may still require corrective action and causebodily injury and property damage to third-party claimants. For these reasons,EPA has not exempted these categories of USTs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Aircraft Owners</T3>. One commenter supported an exemption for aircraftowners, comparing these USTs to motor fuel tanks with a capacity less than110 gallons. All tanks with a capacity of less than 110 gallons are nowexcluded from these requirements. Thus, many aircraft owners with USTsthat contain a capacity of less than 110 gallons are excluded under the<T3>de minimis</T3> exclusion. In addition, EPA has deferred regulationof airport hydrant systems. The Agency is not aware of any evidence tosupport an additional exemption for these categories of USTs that containmore than 110 gallons. </ITAG>B. Compliance Dates (andSection;280.91) Today's rule is effective on January 24, 1988. However, UST owners arerequired to <T3>comply</T3> with this regulation by the date assigned to their appropriatecompliance category in the rule. The composition of the compliance categoriesand the compliance dates for each of these categories is summarized inTable 1. As Table 1 shows, EPA has designated UST ownership as the factordetermining compliance categories. The rationale for this decision is explainedbelow. UST owners in Category I are required to comply on the effective date threemonths after the rule's promulgation. UST owners in Category I includeall petroleum marketing firms that own 1,000 or more USTs and all otherUST-owning entities that report a tangible net worth of $20 million ormore to the SEC, Dun and Bradstreet, the Energy Information Administration,or the Rural Electrification Administration. USTs owners in Category II are required to comply by 12 months after therule's promulgation date. UST owners in Category II include all petroleummarketing firms owning 100 to 999 USTs. USTs owners in Category III are required to comply by 18 months after therule's promulgation date. UST owners in Category III include all petroleummarketing firms owning 13 to 99 USTs at more than one facility. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Compliance Dates for and Composition of Compliance Categories</T4><H1>Category and compliance date for this category</H1><H1>Composition of category</H1><H2>Petroleum marketing firms</H2><H2>Nonpetroleum marketing firms</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">I. 3 months after promulgation date of rule, on the effective date<D>All petroleum marketing firms owning 1,000 or more USTs </D><D>All UST-owning non-petroleum marketing firms that report a tangiblenet worth of $20 million or more to the SEC, Dun and Bradstreet, the EnergyInformation Administration, or the Rural Electrification Administration.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">II. 12 months after promulgation date of rule <D>All petroleum marketing firms owning 100-999 USTs </D><D>None.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">III. 18 months after promulgation date of rule <D>All petroleum firms owning 13-99 USTs at more than one facility </D><D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">IV. 24 months after promulgation date of rule <D>All petroleum firms owning 1-12 USTs or owning only one facility withfewer than 100 USTs </D><D>All UST-owning non-petroleum marketing firms that do not report a tangiblenet worth of $20 million or more to the SEC, Dun and Bradstreet, the EnergyInformation Administration, or the Rural Electrification Administration,including all local government entities.</D></ITAG></ITAG>UST owners in Category IV are required to comply by 24 months after therule's promulgation date. UST owners in Category IV include all petroleummarketing firms owning 1-12 USTs or those owning only one facility withfewer than 100 USTs. (For example, a petroleum marketing firm owning 13USTs at one facility would be classified by EPA in Category IV.) CategoryIV also include all UST-owning firms not engaged in petroleum marketingbut having tangible net worth of less than $20 million and all local governmententities. In andSection; 280.92 of the final rule, the Agency defines petroleum marketingfirms as all firms owning facilities engaged in petroleum production, refining,or marketing. These includes all facilities at which petroleum is producedand all facilities at which petroleum is produced and all facilities fromwhich petroleum is sold or transferred to other petroleum marketing orto the public. Petroleum production facilities include all refineries andall facilities engaged in producing petroleum products from purchased materials.Facilities from which petroleum is sold or transferred to other petroleummarketers or to the public include all wholesale petroleum marketers facilities,such as bulk terminals and bulk plants, and all retail petroleum marketingfacilities, such as automobile service stations, marine service stations,truck stops, convenience stores selling gasoline, etc. The Agency considersall facilities selling petroleum products to the public to be retail petroleummarketing facilities, even if the amount of petroleum sold is minimal.Facilities that store petroleum products in underground storage tanks <T3>only</T3> to refuel their own vehicles (e.g., establishments owningfleets of vehicles) are not considered facilities that are engaged in petroleummarketing. Establishments that store fuel to refuel vehicles rented tothe public (e.g., rental car facilities) are not considered facilitiesengaged in petroleum marketing as long as the fuel is not sold to the publicat large. The Agency considers firms owning both petroleum marketing facilities andother types of facilities that are not engaged in petroleum marketing tobe petroleum marketing firms. The compliance date for such firms is basedon the total number of USTs owned at their petroleum marketing facilitiesand at their other facilities. Many commenters on EPA's proposed rules suggested that the Agency delaythe effective date of the rule because pollution liability insurance forUSTs and other financial assurance mechanisms would not be available toa large number of UST owners and operators by the rule's effective date.Although EPA has decided not to delay the effective date of this rule,the Agency is concerned about the unavailability of financial assurancemechanisms for a large portion of the regulated community. On March 31,1988, EPA published a supplement to the proposed rule (53 FR 10401) inwhich the Agency explained that it was considering a phase-in of the financialresponsibility regulations to allow different categories of owners andoperators to come into compliance at different times after publicationof the final rules. The principal reason for the phase-in was to providesufficient time for owners and operators to obtain financial assurancein accordance with the rules. Additional reasons for the proposed phase-inincluded: <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The time necessary for providers of financial assurance mechanismsto conform them to EPA's requirements; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The time necessary to provide assistance and outreach programsfor portions of the regulated community; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The administrative difficulties of trying to implement thisregulation for such a large and diverse regulated community; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The unavailability of mechanisms to large portions of theregulated community. </ITAG>The Agency received a large number of comments in response to this notice.Although the majority of commenters generally agreed with the phase-instrategy, many suggested an across-the-board delay and still others wereconcerned about the possible negative consequences of any type of delay(including a phase-in) to the implementation of the financial responsibilityrules. The Agency agrees with many commenters who pointed out that therelative unavailability of financial responsibility mechanisms (primarilyinsurance, the financial test of self-insurance, or state funds) presentsa problem for some members of the regulated community and that a phase-inmay help to alleviate this problem. However, the Agency recognizes thatthe problem of the unavailability of mechanisms for some members of theregulated community may not be resolved before the compliance date forthe requirements for those owners. The Agency retains its discretion touse the suspension of enforcement authority provided in section 9003(d)(5)(D)to address the problem of unavailability in the future. EPA expects thatimplementation of the rule during the phase-in period will enable the Agencyto develop appropriate suspension of enforcement procedures based on thisexperience tailored to the numbers and types of facilities for which assuranceremains unavailable. Many commenters opposed a phase-in or any type of delay in the implementationof these rules. Their arguments included: <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Delaying implementation of financial responsibility ruleswill not increase the availability of insurance and may even further delayany response from the insurance marketplace. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Delaying the implementation of financial responsibility rulesremoves a strong incentive to replace or upgrade substandard USTs quickly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Delaying implementation of the financial responsibility rulesmay delay the establishment of state funds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Delaying implementation of the financial responsibility ruleswill not eliminate the need for regulated entities to apply for a suspensionof enforcement. </ITAG>In deciding that a phase-in is the best regulatory strategy, the Agencyhas attempted to establish compliance dates which are as early as possibleconsidering the type of assurance different types of facilities are likelyto obtain. The use of an approach involving different compliance datesfor different compliance categories is designed to achieve the maximumbalance between the need to ensure financial capability for UST releasesand the necessary time for owners and operators to obtain assurance mechanisms.For example, EPA believes that almost all firms in Category I will be ableto comply with these requirements using the financial test of self-insuranceor a guarantee. Chapter 2 of an EPA-sponsored study, entitled ``FinancialResponsibility for Underground Storage Tank Releases: Financial Profileof Retail Motor Fuel Marketing Firms,'' shows that all but one of the firmsfor whom data were collected that own 1,000 or more USTs (assuming thatthere are 4.1 USTs per outlet) have over $20 million in tangible net worth.Firms in other industry sectors with at least $20 million in tangible networth will be able to pass the financial test of self-insurance as longas they file financial statements with the SEC, the Energy InformationAdministration, or the Rural Electrification Administration, or they reporttheir tangible net worth to Dun and Bradstreet and Dun and Bradstreet assignsthem a financial strength rating of 4A or 5A. The Agency sees no reasonwhy such firms should not be required to comply with this regulation bythe effective date of the requirements.Further, almost all firms in Category II either have insurance now or canbuy it from providers already in the marketplace, on the condition thatthey upgrade their tanks to meet insurers' criteria. These firms have 12months from the promulgation date to apply for insurance and to upgradetheir tanks. This period also gives insurance providers time to conformtheir pollution liability or environmental impairment policies to EPA'sregulatory requirements and to raise the necessary capital or reinsuranceto offer the limits of liability required in today's rules.The Agency recognizes that the smaller petroleum marketing firms in CategoryIII are less likely than firms in Category II to have have insurance andtherefore need additional time for processing of their insurance applicationsand upgrading their USTs to meet insurers' requirements. These firms have18 months from the promulgation date to comply with the regulations.The Agency expects that regulated entities in Category IV (which includesthe smallest petroleum marketing firms, general industry firms with tangiblenet worth under $20 million, local government entities, etc.) will havethe most difficulty obtaining financial assurance. Most of these entitiescannot pass the financial test of self-insurance included in today's rule,and pollution liability insurance has not generally been available to them.EPA expects that the majority of these regulated entities will have torely on state funds for assurance. Many commenters responding to the SupplementalNotice (53 FR 10401) stressed that EPA's estimate of 18 months for statefunds to form was overly optimistic. Today's rule would give those entitiesrelying on a state fund for financial assurance 24 months from the rule'spromulgation date to come into compliance.In the absence of a phase-in, the Agency does not believe that most entitiesin the regulated community would have adequate time to comply with thefinancial responsibility regulations, because only the self-insurance mechanismcan be implemented immediately by those firms able to use it. Those firmsable to use insurance will probably not be able to comply by the effectivedate of the regulations. Even those firms that already have UST pollutionliability policies probably do not have policies that conform to EPA'srequirements or that have sufficient limits of liability. These policieswill have to be changed or augmented to comply with today's financial responsibilityregulation.It will be even more difficult for those firms that may be able to obtaininsurance but have not yet done so to comply by the effective date of theregulations. One current insurer of USTs commented that some type of phase-inis ``imperative'' because the administrative capacity of UST insurers isnot sufficient to accommodate all tank owners and operators who want topurchase insurance. In addition, most of the pollution liability insurancecurrently being offered to petroleum marketers contains preconditions withrespect to the age of the USTs insured and leak detection methods. Firmswith older USTs or inadequate leak detection methods will need time tocomply with these insurer requirements. It would be impossible for allfirms not already meeting these requirements to comply with them by theeffective date of the regulations. Finally, as pointed out by many commenters,the development of state funds can take a considerable amount of time.Thus, the Agency concludes that it would be impossible for most of theregulated community to comply with today's financial responsibility requirementswithin 90 days of the promulgation of the regulations.At the same time, the discretionary authority to suspend enforcement ofthe rules is not an adequate substitute for the phase-in because suspensiondoes not serve the same purpose as a phase-in. The Agency believes thathuman health and the environment will be better protected by establishingreasonable compliance dates than by requiring large portions of the regulatedcommunity to devote their immedaite compliance efforts to petitioning fora suspension of enforcement. During the phase-in period, the resourcesof the regulated community can be devoted to obtaining financial assurancemechanisms, and the resources of the states, EPA, and the regulated communitycan be devoted to developing and encouraging the development of mechanismssuch as state funds and RRGs. Inclusion of a phase-in will restrict theuse of the suspension of enforcement mechanism to those situations wherecompliance difficulties have to do with things other than inadequate timeto complete administrative activities and to meet insurers' preconditions.The Agency also does not believe that deferral of the requirements is auseful substitute for a phase-in. A phase-in has two advantages over adeferral. First, a phase-in is more protective of human health and theenvironment than a deferral in that it requires those who can obtain financialresponsibility mechanisms to do so. Second, when the deferral period isended, there is likely to be a last-minute rush of activity that couldoverwhelm the insurance industry's administrative capacity and the capacityof those businesses providing tank replacement, upgrading, and release-detectionservices.Furthermore, the Agency does not think this relatively short phase-in willdelay the entry of new insurers into the marketplace. If the rule did notinclude a phase-in of compliance dates, any new insurer would have to (1)develop and announce a new program that would comply with EPA's requirementsand (2) process and accept applications for this program within 90 daysto allow the regulated community to comply by the effective date of theregulations. EPA believes it would be extremely difficult for UST ownersand operators to get pollution liability insurance conforming to the requirementsof this rule from new insurers within 90 days of the rule's effective date.The phase-in establishes the necessary time for new insurance programsto develop, publicize their operations, and process applications. Withthe phase-in, a new program would have 1 year to carry out these stepsfor its first customers and an additional year to process applicationsfor other members of the regulated community. Furthermore, the regulatedcommunity still has a strong incentive to purchase insurance prior to therequired compliance dates. The phase-in of compliance with the financialresponsibility requirements does not relieve the regulated community ofliability for corrective action and third-party liability. Thus, many inthe regulated community will attempt to obtain insurance as soon as itbecomes available.Nor does the Agency believe that the phase-in will remove incentives forregulated entities to replace or upgrade substandard USTs or to initiateleak detection. If the rule had only one compliance date, it would be impossiblefor the existing tank replacement and leak detection industries to provideadequate professional service to the many firms that may need their services.The technical standards rule phases in leak detection and tank upgradingand replacement requirements for the same reason.Finally, the Agency does not believe that the phase-in will delay the implementationof state funds. None of the state representatives who commented on theSupplemental Notice (53 FR 10401) were of the opinion that the phase-inwould delay the implementation of state funds. They explained that stateswould need time to pass laws authorizing the establishment of a fund, todevelop regulations specifying how the fund would be implemented, and todevelop revenue sources and capitalize the fund. In fact, EPA views thephase-in as the only way to allow states adequate time to develop thoughtful,sound, and adequately-funded programs. The Agency believes it is more protectiveof human health and the environment to allow time for the development ofwell-thought-out programs than to create a situation that will result inthe development of state funds that have not been properly designed.In the example given in the Supplemental Notice (53 FR 10401), the phase-incategories were set up based on the number of tanks owned or operated asan indicator of financial strength and thus the time needed to comply withthe rule. In today's rule, the phase-in categories are set up based onUST ownership for petroleum marketing firms and on net worth for non-petroleummarketing firms. One commenter requested that EPA clarify, both for thepurpose of the phase-in and for the rule in general, that ``individualpersons controlling separately operated facilities may * * * treat themselveseither as a single owner or operator or as several independent operators.''Although this interpretation reflects EPA's intention with regard to mostprovisions of the final rule being promulgated today (see Section III.A.1.above), it is not the basis for the final rule's phase-in provision. Instead,the phase-in is based on the total number of USTs owned to make clear atwhat time USTs that are owned and operated by different entities are requiredto be in compliance with the final rule. UST ownership is a better indicatorof both ability to comply with the financial test and to obtain insurance.If the Agency adopted the commenter's suggestion, many more owners or operatorsof USTs at more than one facility could qualify for a later compliancedate. EPA has designated UST ownership, rather than UST operation, as thefactor determining the compliance category so that earlier compliance dateswill be required for most USTs (since UST-owning firms tend to be largerthan UST-operating firms).The majority of commenters agreed that the number of tanks is the mostreasonable basis on which to predicate a compliance date phase-in. Thereasons for the choice of the number-of-tanks criterion included:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The number of tanks reflects a firm's financial strengthand its ability to get insurance (and thus to comply with the rule);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The number of tanks is a partial measure of the risk of release;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The number of tanks is easy to determine for compliance purposesand easy to verify for enforcement purposes.</ITAG>Other phase-in criteria suggested by commenters included measures thatwere more reflective of risk (e.g., age, storage capacity, or locationof tanks), financial strength, and type of industry. One commenter suggestedthat the basis for compliance should be the ability of owners or operatorsto self-insure or to obtain insurance from private or public sources. Inessence, this is the strategy the Agency has adopted: it involves separatingthe regulated community into two groups, petroleum marketing firms andother regulated entities. For petroleum marketing firms, the number oftanks owned acts as a reasonable proxy for the ability of a firm to self-insureor to obtain insurance. For other regulated entities, the $20 million intangible net worth requirement is a good proxy for firms that will be ableto use the financial test because almost all firms with $20 million intangible net worth should be able to use the financial test, irrespectiveof how many tanks that they own. (Entities with less than $20 million intangible net worth may not be able to self-insure and insurance has notbeen available to such firms up to now.)The Agency rejected basing the phase-in on risk-related measures becausea schedule designed to require the highest risk USTs to comply first wouldnot further the Agency's objective in phasing in compliance with the rules.The Agency's objective for phasing in compliance is to give the regulatedcommunity the time it will need to obtain assurance. For this reason, indeveloping the phase-in the Agency considered only those factors (e.g.,financial strength) related to the ability of various segments of the regulatedcommunity to obtain assurance.The Agency also notes that requiring high-risk USTs to comply first couldhave a negative impact on the availability of financial assurance mechanisms.If high-risk USTs were required to comply first (as some commenters suggested),insurers already in the market would be reluctant to insure additionalUSTs and new insurers would be reluctant to enter the market. Therefore,this would act as a disincentive to a gradual increase in the availabilityof insurance.In the example described in the March 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA set up compliance categories andcompliance dates as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs60</C> <H1>Compliance date</H1><H1>Number of tanks owned or operated</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Effective date of rule<D>1,500 or more.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 months after effective date.<D>50 to 1,499.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12 months after effective date.<D>6 to 49.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18 months after effective date.<D>1 to 5.</D></ITAG></ITAG>For reasons already discussed, EPA decided to base the phase-in on thenumber of USTs owned and to develop different compliance categories forpetroleum marketing firms and for non-petroleum marketing firms to reflectthe time necessary for regulated entities to comply with this regulation.The Agency decided to give firms in the second category more time to complyand to change the number of tanks owned (for petroleum marketing firms)in each category so that the categories would more accurately reflect thisobjective. In making these changes, the Agency was aided by informationprovided by commenters with regard to the availability of assurance tovarious segments of the regulated community.Petroleum marketing firms owning 1,000 or more USTs (as opposed to 1,500or more USTs) are in Category I because the Agency believes that such firmscan almost always use the financial test of self-insurance.\5\<NOTE/> Petroleum marketing firms owning between 100 to 999 USTs(as opposed to 50 to 1,499 USTs) are in Category II because the Agencybelieves this UST ownership spread more accurately represents the UST-owningfirms that have insurance now or can obtain it most easily. Petroleum marketingfirms owning between 13 and 99 USTs at more than one facility (as opposedto 6 to 49 USTs) are in Category III because this range more accuratelyrepresents UST-owning firms that are eligible for insurance but may needmore time to obtain it than firms in Category II. In addition, becauseinsurance has not been available to petroleum marketing firms owning onlyone facility in the past, such facilities have been moved to Category IV.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Information supporting EPA's assumptions with regard tothe types of financial assurance mechanisms available to petroleum marketingfirms owning different numbers of USTs can be found in the Regulatory ImpactAnalysis for the rule that is available in the docket.Category IV was expanded to include firms owning 1 to 12 USTs or, as notedabove, only one facility with fewer than 100 USTs (as opposed to 1 to 5USTs). This expansion of the upper limit of the category from 5 to 12 USTsallows additional time for compliance for the smallest rural jobbers. Thesefirms may have older USTs and greater difficulty obtaining insurance thanother petroleum marketers. All non-petroleum marketing firms which cannotself-insure, including local government entities, have also been includedin Category IV because pollution liability insurance has not been availableto these entities in the past.C. Definition of Terms (andSection; 280.92)In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Agency discussed definitionsfor several terms used in the rule. With the exception of ``occurrence,''the Agency is adopting the definitions as proposed. This discussion addressesonly those terms for which the Agency received comment.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Accidental Release and Occurrence</ITAG>In the April 17, 1987, proposal, the Agency defined ``accidental release''as<ITAG tagnum="20">``Any sudden or nonsudden release of petroleum arising from operatingan underground storage tank that results in a need for corrective action,bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the tankowner or operator (andSection; 280.91).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This definition incorporates both sudden and nonsudden releases, asrequired by RCRA Section 9003(c)(6). In addition, the Agency proposed todefine ``occurrence'' as ``an accident, including continuous or repeatedexposure to conditions, which results in a release from an undergroundstorage tank.''Two commenters asserted that the proposed definitions of occurrence andaccidental release do not reflect standard insurance definitions. The commentersnoted that the comprehensive general liability (CGL) form issued by theInsurance Service Office (ISO) defines ``occurrence'' as ``an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same generallyharmful conditions.'' They also noted that the ISO's pollution liabilitycoverage form does not define ``occurrence'' or ``release.'' Instead, thepolicy uses the term ``pollution incident.'' These commenters urged EPAto remove the definitions of ``occurrence'' and ``accidental release''from the rule and the certificate and endorsement forms, and to replacethem with the term ``pollution incident.'' Another commenter argued thatthe definition of ``occurrence'' should be changed to reflect the ISO'snewest CGL form.Commenters warned that if the definitions in the regulation remain at variancewith those in use in the ISO's pollution liability coverage form, courtswill have to review more than one definition of key policy terms duringlitigation. Insurers indicated that EPA's use of non-standard definitionsin today's rule would reduce the range of predictability in UST coverageand expose insurers to an uncertain amount of liability. Such conditions,they argued, would seriously impair the insurance industry's willingnessto provide liability insurance required by today's rule.In specifying the language in the certificate of insurance and endorsement,the Agency does not intend to modify contractural obligations regardingthe extent of coverage under insurance policies used to satisfy the liabilitycoverage requirement. In response to the problems cited by commenters,the Agency has retained the definition of ``occurrence'' but added clarifyinglanguage to the rule. The rule now allows insurance policies containingalternate definitions of ``occurrence'' or standard terms other than ``occurrence,''such as ``pollution incident,'' to be used to satisfy the UST liabilitycoverage requirements. This definition of occurrence is included in today'srule to assist in the understanding of the financial assurance requirements,i.e., to clarify the scope of coverage required under the rule. It is notintended to limit the meaning of ``occurrence'' in a way that conflictswith general insurance industry usage.The Agency prefers not to require that policies incorporate a specificdefinition of ``occurrence'' because of the wide range of definitions currentlyin use and because insurance practices may change over time. However, theAgency has the authority under RCRA section 9003(d)(1) to specify acceptableand unacceptable liability insurance policy terms and the Agency may needto specify such terms in the future. In addition, policies employing unsatisfactorydefinitions of ``occurrence'' or unsatisfactory terms other than ``occurrence''may not provide liability protection in accordance with today's rule.In addition, the Agency has made a minor change to the definition of ``accidentalrelease'' simply to capture the meaning more precisely. The modified definition,with the modification in italics, is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">``Any sudden or nonsudden release of petroleum arising from operatingan underground storage tank that results in a need for corrective action</ITAG><T3>and/or compensation for </T3>bodily injury or property damage neitherexpected nor intended by the tank owner or operator (andSection; 280.92(a)).The Agency received two comments arguing that the definitions of ``occurrence''and ``accidental releases'' should include releases that are caused intentionally(e.g., sabotage, vandalism). EPA believes that an explicit inclusion isunnecessary. Since ``accidental release'' is defined as a release resultingin ``a need for corrective action and/or compensation for bodily injuryor property damage, neither expected nor intended by the tank owner ofoperator,'' the relevant determinants of coverage are the intentions andexpectations of the insured. Thus, damage resulting from sabotage or vandalismis accidental if the insured party had no intention or expectation of suchdamage.Finally, a commenter also suggested that vague terms like ``intended''or ``expected'' in the definition of accidental release be defined in therule. However, as discussed above, EPA intends to allow insurers flexibilityin writing policy language by not defining every policy term explicitly.The Agency recognizes that such terms are open to interpretation, but alsorealizes that because they are common in insurance industry usage, definingthem in the rule is not necessary and may limit availability. Therefore,the Agency believes that it is appropriate to leave interpretation of suchterms to private insurance law.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Bodily Injury</ITAG>In the proposal and in the final rule, the Agency defines ``bodily injury''as having the meaning given to it by applicable state law. In addition,the definition excludes those liabilities that, consistent with standardindustry practice, are excluded from coverage in liability insurance policiesfor ``bodily injury.''The Agency received several comments in favor of the proposed definitionand some comments opposed. Commenters opposed to the definition maintainedthat it would create inconsistent definitions, and thus varying scopesof coverage, from state to state. One commenter proposed that EPA define``bodily injury'' as ``any damage to a third party which the tank owneror operator is legally liable for causing due to negligence.''The Agency is reluctant to adopt a standard definition for a number ofreasons. First, the Agency fears that any attempt to redefine ``bodilyinjury'' will result in a more tightly limited insurance market. Commentsreceived from the insurance industry strongly urged EPA to retain the approachin the proposed rule, and predicted that insurers might exit the marketif the term is given a standard definition.Second, EPA recognizes that third parties will generally bring liabilityclaims pursuant to state law. Because the definition of ``bodily injury''and the treatment of bodily injury claims differ from state to state, theAgency believes that mandating a nationwide definition would promote confusionin state courts, which would be required to review two definitions of ``bodilyinjury'' (i.e., a definition pursuant to state law and a standard definition)during litigation.Third, the Agency prefers the definitions of terms used in the liabilityinsurance requirements to be consistent with their common meanings withinthe insurance industry. Since the definition of ``bodily injury'' oftenvaries from state to state, mandating a standard definition would establishdefinitions of terms inconsistent with their common meanings.Consequently, EPA has retained the proposed definition of ``bodily injury''in today's final rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Director of the Implementing Agency</ITAG>This term refers to the person responsible for implementing the UST programunder Subtitle I of RCRA. For USTs in authorized states, this person isthe Director of the state agency; for USTs in states without approved programs,this person is the EPA Regional Administrator.In today's rule, this term replaces the term ``Regional Administrator,''a term used in the proposed rule, wherever appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Petroleum Marketing Facilities</ITAG>This definition was not in the proposed rule. It has been added to thefinal rule to assist in understanding the phased schedule for complianceand to define per-occurrence levels of assurance for USTs. The definitionclosely follows the statutory language of RCRA section 9003(d)(5) (A) and(B). ``Petroleum marketing facilities'' are all facilities at which petroleumis produced or refined and all facilities from which petroleum is soldor transferred to other petroleum marketers or to the public. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Petroleum Marketing Firms</ITAG>These are all firms owning petroleum marketing facilities. Firms owningother types of facilities with USTs, as well as petroleum marketing facilities,are considered to be petroleum marketing firms. This definition also wasnot in the proposed rule. It has been added to the final rule to assistin understanding the phased schedule for compliance. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Property Damage</ITAG>In the proposed rule and in the final rule, the Agency defines propertydamage as having the meaning given it by applicable state laws. In addition,the term excludes those liabilities which, consistent with standard industrypractice, are excluded from coverage in liability insurance policies.One commenter agreed with the Agency's approach, while other commenterssuggested that the definition be modified to cover an intentional act (e.g.,sabotage). Including intentional acts in the definition, the commentersargued, would ensure that owners or operators will be financially responsiblefor all leaks and spills, not just those that are accidental or unintentional.As noted above, the relevant intentions and expectations of damage or injuryare those of the insured. Thus, damage resulting from sabotage would beconsidered accidental if the insured party did not intend or expect suchdamage.Consequently, EPA has decided that including intentional acts in the definitionof ``property damage'' is unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Additional Definitions</ITAG>One commenter suggested that EPA use the broad term ``financial assurance''to designate all acceptable methods of satisfying the financial responsibilityrequirements, and proposed a definition of the term.EPA uses the term ``financial assurance'' to designate all acceptable methodsof satisfying the financial responsibility requirements, but is not definingthe term in today's rule. Because the rule clearly delineates all financialassurance mechanisms by which owners or operators may satisfy these requirements,the Agency believes that defining the term is unnecessary.D. Amount and Scope of Required Financial Responsibility (andSection;280.93)The rule promulgated today requires that owners or operators of petroleumUSTs that are located at facilities engaged in petroleum production, refining,or marketing or that handle more than 10,000 gallons of petroleum per monthdemonstrate evidence of financial responsibility in the minimum amountof $1 million per occurrence to cover corrective action and third-partycompensation costs for accidental releases from their tanks. The minimumper-occurrence amount of assurance required for owners or operators ofUSTs that are not located at facilities engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing and that handle 10,000 gallons or less of petroleumper month is $500,000. In addition, the Agency is establishing requirementsfor annual aggregate levels of assurance, based on the number of USTs tobe assured. Today's rule also includes a paragraph (andSection;280.90(e))that explicitly states that if the owner and the operator of a tank areseparate persons, only one person must demonstrate financial responsibility.The Agency's reason for adding this paragraph is discussed in Section III.A.1,Owners and Operators. The rationale for determining the amount and scope of required assuranceis discussed below, as it pertains to the following topics: (1) Per-Occurrence Amounts. (2) Aggregate Amounts. (3) Apportionment of Costs and Level of Assurance under Separate Mechanisms.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Per-Occurrence Amount </ITAG>Section 280.93(a) of today's rule establishes $1 million per occurrenceas the minimum amount of required financial assurance for owners or operatorsof petroleum USTs located at facilities engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing and for owners or operators of petroleum USTs thathandle more than 10,000 gallons of petroleum per month. The minimum amountof required assurance for USTs that handle 10,000 or less gallons of petroleumper month and are located at facilities that are not engaged in petroleumproduction, refining, or marketing is $500,000. The proposed rule requiredthat <T3>all</T3> owners or operators of petroleum-containing USTs provide assurancein the minimum amount of $1 million. EPA received numerous comments on the subject of the required per-occurrenceamount of assurance. Arguments for lowering this amount of assurance included:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The costs of almost all UST releases are far lower than $1million; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Small businesses cannot afford to obtain $1 million in per-occurrencecoverage; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The money required to pay insurance premiums would be betterspent on upgrading tanks; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurance coverage for $1 million per-occurrence is not available;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A lower per-occurrence limit would encourage insurers andreinsurers to offer UST pollution liability coverage. </ITAG>Several commenters pointed out that EPA had required the same per-occurrencelimit of $1 million for all USTs even though Subtitle I clearly allowsthe Agency to set limits lower than $1 million for USTs at facilities notengaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing and that are notused to handle large amounts of petroleum. The reasons given in supportof a lower per-occurrence limit for USTs at these facilities included manyof the same arguments presented above and additional reasons specific tofacilities not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing.Some of these additional reasons included: <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Low-volume facilities are less likely to have catastrophic-failure-inducedlarge releases; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Low-throughput facilities will have smaller releases fromtheir underground pipes; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Low-throughout facilities can be monitored more accurately.</ITAG>Finally, several commenters argued that $1 million in per-occurrence coveragemight be too low. They explained that past claims data underestimate futureclaims and that both corrective action and third-party liability awardswill be more costly in the future than they have been in the past becauseof corrective action regulations that impose minimum cleanup standards.As explained in the proposal, the minimum $1 million per-occurrence levelrequired for owners or operators of USTs at facilities engaged in petroleumproduction, refining, or marketing was based on the provisions of section9003(d)(5) (A) and (B) of Subtitle I of RCRA. These sections state: <ITAG tagnum="21">(5)(A) The Administrator, in promulgating financial responsibilityregulations under this section, may establish an amount of coverage forparticular classes or categories of underground storage tanks containingpetroleum which shall satisfy such regulations and which shall not be lessthan $1,000,000 for each occurrence with an appropriate aggregate requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The Administrator may set amounts lower than the amounts requiredby subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for underground storage tanks containingpetroleum which are at facilities not engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing and which are not used to handle substantial quantitiesof petroleum. </ITAG>The Agency's interpretation of these provisions is confirmed by the discussionof this amendment to Subtitle I, section 205 of SARA, in the ConferenceReport accompanying SARA. The Report states that ``The Administrator cannotset a minimum financial responsibility requirement of less than $1 millionfor tanks which are engaged in petroleum production, refining or marketing* * *.'' (House Report 99-962, 99th Congress, 2nd Session, p. 264.) Therefore, absent further instruction from Congress, EPA's per-occurrencerequirement for USTs at facilities engaged in petroleum production, refining,and marketing must be at least $1,000,000.The Agency shares the concern expressed by commenters that releases maybe more expensive in the future, and performed an analysis of this issue.The model developed to aid in this analysis estimates both the costs andfrequency of UST-related corrective actions. It takes into account boththe more stringent cleanup standards that will prevail under the technicalstandards being imposed by EPA and the fact that releases will be detectedsooner, when they are smaller, once the regulations have been promulgated.This analysis showed that the average costs of UST-related corrective actionswill be lower rather than higher in the future (see Appendix A of the RegulatoryImpact Analysis for the Financial Responsibility Requirements for UndergroundStorage Tanks Containing Petroleum and Chapter 7 of the Regulatory ImpactAnalysis of the Technical Standards for Underground Storage Tanks). Becausethe number of UST-related releases and the extent of the damage associatedwith these releases will not increase in the future, the Agency is confidentthat corrective action and third-party liability costs will also not increasein the years after promulgation of these requirements.In the final rule, EPA allows owners or operators of petroleum undergroundstorage tanks that are not located at facilities engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing and that handle an average of 10,000 gallons orless of petroleum per month (based on annual throughput for the previouscalendar year) to provide a minimum of $500,000 in per-occurrence assurance.As indicated above, section 9003(d)(5)(B) authorizes the Administratorof EPA to set per-occurrence amounts lower than $1 million for petroleumUSTs located at facilities that are not engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing and that are not used to handle substantial quantitiesof petroleum.Section 9003(d)(5)(C) of Subtitle I lists the factors that the Administratormay consider in setting an amount of assurance lower than $1 million forcertain classes and categories of USTs:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The size, type, location, storage, and handling capacityof underground storage tanks in the class or category and the volume ofpetroleum handled by such tanks;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The likelihood of release and the potential extent of damagefrom any release from underground storage tanks in the class or category;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The economic impact of the limits on the owners and operatorsof each such class or category, particularly relating to the small businesssegment of the petroleum marketing industry;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The availability of methods of financial responsibility inamounts greater than the amount established by this paragraph; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Such other factors as the Administrator deems pertinent.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">When the Agency considered these factors for the proposed rule, itconcluded that a $1 million per-occurrence level of assurance for all USTswas appropriate and would achieve EPA's goal, which was to set a per-occurrencelevel high enough to cover the costs of 99 percent of UST release occurrences.The Agency still believes that this goal is appropriate. Material submittedto the docket in response to the proposed rule has enabled the Agency toperform a more refined analysis of the frequency of per-occurrence claimsat various levels. From this analysis, the Agency concludes that a $500,000level of assurance is adequate to assure the costs of approximately 99percent of per-occurrence claims for USTs with throughputs no greater thanthe throughputs characteristic of USTs at retail motor fuel marketing facilities.(This analysis is provided in Appendix B to the Regulatory Impact Analysis.)Thus, the Agency has revised the final rule to provide a lower per-occurrencelevel for such facilities, and has limited facilities qualifying for thislower per-occurrence amount to those with UST throughputs no greater thanretail motor fuel marketing facilities (i.e., 10,000 gallons per month).In responding to comments on the proposal and revising the rule, the Agencyconsidered each of the criteria in section 9003(d)(5)(C), both when evaluatinga per-occurrence limit of $500,000 and when identifying the class of USTsthat would be allowed to use this lower per-occurrence limit. The Agencydecided to use monthly throughput as the measure that best distinguishesUSTs used in petroleum producing, refining, and marketing, for which Congressmandated a minimum per-occurrence limit of $1,000,000, from USTs used inother industries that might appropriately be assigned a lower per-occurrencelimit. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, factors suchas age of tank, material of construction, and the presence of a secondarycontainment are not critical in determining a per-occurrence limit:<ITAG tagnum="21">Although such factors do affect a tank's propensity to leak, thereis no evidence to suggest that any of these factors affects the costs relatedto a release. The setting of an appropriate per-occurrence level dependson the costs of individual releases rather than on the probability thata release will occur, and there is therefore no reason why the factorsmentioned above should have a bearing on the per-occurrence level of coveragerequired. For example, a release from a 1-year-old tank can be just asexpensive to address as a release from a 20-year-old tank.</ITAG>The Agency based its decision to allow a lower per-occurrence limit forfacilities that are not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketingand that have a monthly throughput of 10,000 gallons or less primarilyon the extent of the potential damage associated with releases from thesetanks. The Agency also carefully analyzed the extensive UST claims recordsubmitted by the largest insurer of service station USTs and found thatthis record provided statistically significant evidence that releases costingmore than $500,000 occur less than 1 percent of the time. The Agency hasconcluded that coverage of $500,000 will assure that the per-occurrencelimit is exceeded less than 1 percent of the time. These same data showthat a per-occurrence limit set below the $500,000 level would be exceededmore than 1 percent of the time. For this reason, the final rule rejects those suggestions of commentersthat low-throughput USTs be exempted or that the per-occurrence limit forsuch USTs be set below $500,000. The choice of 10,000 gallons per month as the definition of ``substantialquantities of petroleum'' is also consistent with Congressional intentas expressed in the Conference Report accompanying SARA. It states thatthe Administrator cannot:<ITAG tagnum="20">set a minimum financial responsibility requirement of less than $1million *</ITAG>** for tanks that dispense very large volumes, for instancetanks at airports. (p. 264)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The 10,000-gallon-per-month throughput limit for USTs qualifying forthe $500,000 minimum per-occurrence amount is far lower than the volumeof fuel dispensed monthly at typical airports. EPA has not considered economic impact to be a primary factor in determiningthe appropriate per-occurrence limits. The Agency's regulatory impact analysisfound that the cost of insurance premiums would have relatively minor impactson most smaller firms that are not engaged in retail motor fuel marketing.Further, the threat to human health and the environment posed by releasesfrom USTs is the same, in terms of severity, whether the leaking tank isowned by a small firm or a large firm. The Agency agrees with those commenters who suggested that facilities outsidethe retail motor fuel marketing industry may have difficulty obtainingfinancial assurance mechanisms. The Agency has found that no insurer offeringpolicies to facilities not engaged in petroleum production, refining, ormarketing meets these coverage requirements. Lowering the per-occurrencelimit may serve to increase the availability of financial assurance mechanisms.A lower per-occurrence limit will make it easier for insurers with limitedreserves to offer these policies, will ease the capitalization of RRGs,and will allow states to set up state funds with less commitment of funds.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Aggregate Amounts </ITAG>Section 9003(d)(5)(A) of Subtitle I grants the Administrator discretionto set ``an appropriate aggregate requirement'' for financial responsibilityfor petroleum USTs. In andSection;280.92(b) of the proposed rule issued onApril 17, 1987, owners or operators of petroleum USTs were required todemonstrate evidence of financial responsibility in annual aggregate amountsthat varied from $1 million to $6 million, depending on the number of USTsassured (see Table 2) by the mechanism or combination of mechanisms. (Forthe purposes of determining required aggregate levels of coverage only,any reference to tanks means only individual containment units and doesnot include combinations of these units. See andSection;280.93(c).) <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,12 </C><T4>Table</T4> 2._<T4>Proposed Aggregate Schedule </T4><H1>Number of tanks </H1><H1>Annual aggregate amount</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1-12 tanks <D>$1,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13-60 tanks <D>2,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">61-140 tanks <D>3,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">141-250 tanks <D>4,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">251-340 tanks <D>5,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">341 or more tanks <D>6,000,000</D></ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Agency considered this appropriate because the aggregates wereset at a sufficiently high level that corrective action and third-partyliability costs incurred in any one year from releases from petroleum USTswould not be exceeded more than one percent of the time. The aggregateamounts were derived from an analysis of the probability and magnitudeof corrective action and third-party liability costs during the first fiveyears after the technical standards were promulgated. EPA's analysis usedan annual probability of 11.8 percent that a tank would experience a releaseduring these years. The Agency received numerous comments on the proposed aggregate schedule,many of which called for lower aggregate levels. Commenters justified theirrequests for lower aggregates on the grounds that insurers reported norelease costs exceeding $2 million and that the Agency had based its proposedaggregate schedule on an unrealistically high (11.8 percent) release probabilityrate. They also pointed out that aggregate insurance coverage over $2 millionwas unavailable, higher aggregate levels would cause correspondingly higherinsurance premium costs, and the money needed for higher premium costswould be better spent on upgrading tanks. The two largest insurers of USTsnoted that an aggregate of $2,000,000 had never been exceeded on any oftheir policies. The Agency continues to find that the aggregate is most appropriately seton the basis of the number of USTs covered by a financial mechanism, andthat an aggregate should generally provide adequate funding 99 percentof the time. However, the Agency agrees with those commenters who arguedthat EPA's initial estimates, both of the costs and probabilities of releases,were too high, especially for those firms that will actually be able toobtain insurance. In addition, the Agency recognizes that both the availabilityof financial mechanisms and economic impacts should be considered in determiningclasses and categories with respect to aggregate limits, as authorizedunder section 9003(d)(5)(C). As a result of these considerations, the Agencyhas revised its aggregate schedule so that the maximum aggregate is $2,000,000(the maximum aggregate currently available), and mechanisms covering 100USTs or less may use an aggregate of $1,000,000. Table 3 presents the aggregateschedule included in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,12 </C><T4>Table</T4> 3._<T4>Aggregate Schedule </T4><H1>Number of tanks </H1><H1>Annual aggregate amount</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1-100 tanks <D>$1,000,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101 or more tanks <D>2,000,000</D></ITAG></ITAG> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This revised aggregate schedule assures that most firms will not exceedthe aggregate more than 1 percent of the time, given the Agency's revisedestimates of the risk of UST releases. (See Appendix B of the RegulatoryImpact Analysis for the Financial Responsibility Requirements for UndergroundStorage Tanks Containing Petroleum.) The revised aggregate schedule alsohas a number of important advantages over the proposed schedule. First,insurance programs do not currently provide coverage for aggregates higherthan $2 million. Thus, under the revised schedule, which caps aggregatesat $2 million, firms will be able to use existing insurance programs. Also,the lowered aggregates should encourage greater availability of mechanismsother than insurance and thus enable more owners or operators to utilizealternate mechanisms. For example, by reducing the amount of capitalizationrequired, the revised schedule will make it easier to capitalize RRGs andstate funds that form to provide UST pollution liability insurance. Inaddition, firms that already have pollution liability insurance for theirUSTs at the $1 million and $2 million aggregate levels will not be requiredto find methods of meeting the balance of their financial responsibilityobligations. Given that these aggregate levels ensure that most UST ownersand operators will not exceed the aggregate more than 1 percent of thetime, EPA believes that the cost of requiring such additional assurancewould be unnecessary. Under the revised aggregate schedule, there are two categories of firmsthat may exceed the aggregate more than 1 percent of the time. The firstcategory includes firms with more than 500 USTs. (These firms also couldhave exceeded the aggregate more than 1 percent of the time under the proposedaggregate schedule.) The Agency has not extended the aggregate schedulefor firms owning more than 500 USTs because these firms are large and usuallyhave more than $1 billion in net worth. Such firms can easily meet theirfinancial obligations for UST corrective action and third-party liability,even if these obligations exceed $2 million. Futher, these firms tend tohave good leak prevention programs and consequently have lower risks ofUST releases than most similar firms. The second category of firms that may have more than a 1 percent chanceof exceeding the aggregate are firms with between 40 and 100 USTs thatdo not have sufficient leak detection programs. However, most firms withbetween 40 and 100 USTs are currently insured and meet insurers' leak detectionrequirements. Because the small number of firms with between 40 and 100USTs that do not have sufficient leak detection programs will have to meetEPA's UST leak detection technical standards within 5 years, the Agencyhas decided not to set a higher aggregate for these firms on the basisof their temporarily higher risks. The Agency received a number of comments suggesting that a lower aggregatelevel for owners or operators of upgraded tanks could provide an incentivefor other owners or operators to upgrade their systems_in essence a ``creditsystem.'' EPA agrees with these suggestions, but because the Agency haslowered the maximum aggregate level of required assurance from $6 millionto $2 million and has raised the number of tanks qualifying for the $1million aggregate from 12 to 100, much of the incentive to upgrade tanksand qualify for a lower level of required assurance has effectively beeneliminated. Given that few owners or operators would be able to upgradetanks to a level that would qualify for a lower amount of assurance, EPAbelieves that the complexity of developing, implementing, and administeringsuch a program far outweighs its potential benefits. Therefore, the Agencystill believes that it is appropriate to continue to use the number oftanks owned or operated, rather than tank characteristics, as the basisfor determining aggregate levels. During the comment period, a number of questions were raised regardingthe effective date for increases in an aggregate level when an owner oroperator acquires or installs additional tanks. The Agency agrees thatit could prove awkward to change an aggregate level in midyear and tookthat factor into consideration in determining when financial assurancelevels should be updated. Financial assurance mechanisms such as insurancepolicies and letters of credit are generally written for one year, andthe final rule is consistent with this practice. Thus, an owner or operatorwho is using a single mechanism to assure his tanks and who has increasedthe number of tanks for which he is providing financial assurance is requiredto update the level of assurance (i.e., the aggregate level) on the anniversarydate of the financial assurance mechanism. If this same owner or operatoris using a combination of mechanisms to provide financial assurance forhis tanks, the level of assurance must be updated by the first-occurringanniversary of any of the mechanisms being used (excluding a financialtest or guarantee) (see andSection;280.93(f)). The question of tank numbers also arose in the context of determining theappropriate aggregate amount when a firm is acting as a self-insurer, guarantor,and/or indemnitor (however, indemnities are not an allowable mechanismunder the final rule, as discussed in Section III.G of the preamble). Byaggregate amount, EPA means the total of all costs potentially incurredwithin a given year for all releases from petroleum USTs for which evidenceof financial responsibility is being demonstrated by a single mechanismor a combination of mechanisms. If an owner or operator uses differentfinancial assurance mechanisms to cover different USTs, the appropriateaggregate amount is based on the number of tanks covered by each separatemechanism or combination of mechanisms. One commenter recommended that,for the purpose of determining whether a firm passes the financial test,the aggregate level of coverage be ``based on the total number of tanksfor which a firm is responsible by self-insurance, indemnity, or guaranty.''Because this was EPA's intention at the time of the proposal, the Agencyrecognizes that the explanation in the preamble to the proposed rule confusedsome commenters. By stating that the aggregate amount is based on the numberof tanks for which a single mechanism or combination of mechanisms is beingused to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility the Agency means:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. If an owner or operator self-insures his own tanks and guaranteestanks belonging to a different owner or operator, the owner must pass the<T3>financial test</T3> based on the total number of tanks self-insuredand guaranteed. Two different examples follow:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If an owner is self-insuring 60 tanks and guaranteeing 60tanks, the amount of annual aggregate assurance to be demonstrated to usethe financial test to self-insure and guarantee these tanks is $2 million.The guarantee must be issued for an aggregate amount of $1 million. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If a guarantor guarantees 60 tanks for each of three differentowners, the amount of annual aggregate assurance to be demonstrated touse the financial test to guarantee these 180 tanks is $2 million. Eachof the three guarantees, however, must be issued for an aggregate amountof $1 million.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. If an owner or operator uses a <T3>combination of mechanisms</T3> (e.g., insurance and surety bond) todemonstrate evidence of financial responsibility, the aggregate amountsprovided by these mechanisms added together must equal the required aggregateamount for the number of tanks for which these mechanisms are demonstratingfinancial responsibility. For example, if an owner with 200 tanks has insurancewith a $1 million aggregate, aggregates of additional mechanisms for thesetanks must equal at least $1 million, for a total of $2 million in aggregatecoverage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. If an owner or operator uses one financial mechanism to demonstrateevidence of financial responsibility for one set of tanks and another mechanismto demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for a different setof tanks, each mechanism must have an aggregate amount appropriate to theseparate set of tanks assured. For example, an owner has a total of 300tanks: 140 tanks in one state and 160 tanks in another state. The 140 tanksare assured at the $2 million aggregate level by a mandatory participationstate fund that only assures tanks in that state. The owner must provideadditional financial assurance at the $2 million aggregate level for theother 160 tanks located elsewhere. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Apportionment of Costs and Levels of Coverage Under Separate Mechanisms</ITAG>Several commenters questioned the provision that separate mechanisms (orcombinations of mechanisms) obtained for corrective action and third-partyliability must each be at the full amount of required assurance. The commentersbelieved that this provision would be prohibitively expensive. The Agencyhas retained this provision in the final rule despite the added costs ofproviding coverage under this approach. As explained in the preamble tothe proposed rule, the Agency decided not to apportion costs between third-partyliability and corrective action because apportionment limits the amountof funds that are available for either type of cost. Thus, mechanisms coveringthese costs separately cannot be set at amounts less than the full amountof required assurance. Owners or operators may use a combination of mechanisms to obtain a totalof $1 million per occurrence and appropriate aggregates, as long as bothcorrective action and third-party compensation are fully covered. For example,an owner or operator may obtain insurance coverage for the first $100,000of corrective action and third-party liability costs and use an approvedstate fund to cover corrective action and third-party liability costs inexcess of $100,000 up to $1,000,000. In another example, an owner or operatorcould obtain insurance coverage for the first $100,000 of corrective actionand $300,000 of liability costs and use an approved state fund to assurecorrective action costs above $100,000 and third-party liability costsabove $300,000, up to $1 million. E. Allowable Mechanisms and Combinations (andSection; 280.94) 1. <T3>Mechanisms Allowed. </T3>The proposed rule allowed a variety of mechanismsto be used to demonstrate financial responsibility, including: a financialtest of self-insurance, guarantee contract, indemnity contract, insurance,RRG coverage, surety bond, letter of credit, state-required mechanisms,or a state fund or other state assumption of responsibility. In general,commenters supported the range of allowable mechanisms proposed by theAgency. As discussed below, the final rule authorizes the use of each ofthe proposed mechanisms, with the exception of the indemnity contract,and an additional mechanism, a fully-funded trust fund.The preamble to the proposed rule stated that three mechanisms were consideredbut not included in the set of allowable mechanisms: trust funds, securityagreements, and lines of credit. One commenter explicitly supported theAgency's rationale for excluding trust funds and security agreements. TheAgency rejected security agreements because of three concerns with respectto the adequacy of the assurance such agreements would provide: (1) Theliquidity of the collateral subject to the agreement; (2) the proceduralrequirements to establish and maintain a security agreement; and (3) theability of the implementing agency to seize and sell the collateral.One commenter urged the agency to allow lines of credit, stating that linesof credit could be used for UST purposes as well as for other businesspurposes. The Agency believes, however, that its basis for rejecting linesof credit (i.e., that they are conditional on the current financial standingof the borrower and therefore do not represent a substitution of the issuer'scredit for the borrower's) continues to be valid and, thus, that linesof credit should not be an allowable mechanism.Another commenter advocated the inclusion of trust funds in the set ofallowable mechanisms, claiming that large firms may want to use a trustfund to cover multiple tanks if other mechanisms are not available. Thecommenter recommended allowing either a fully funded trust fund or partialfunding combined with additional coverage from another instrument.The Agency has decided to include the trust fund as an allowable financialassurance mechanism. (See also Section III.M of this preamble.) For reasonscited in the preamble to the proposed rule, a trust fund with a build-upperiod does not provide adequate financial assurance for corrective actionand third-party liability which could be incurred at any time in the future.However, the Agency will allow a trust fund that is immediately fundedat the full amount of coverage, or partially funded and combined with anothermechanism to provide full coverage. Although such a trust fund will becostly compared to other mechanisms, the Agency decided to allow it asanother option to the coverage requirements.The Agency has also removed indemnities from allowable mechanisms. In orderto cover third-party liability, indemnities so closely duplicate the structureand operation of a guarantee contract that there was little to be gainedby including it, and including it as a separate mechanism might createunnecessary confusion. Indemnities would generally be provided by the samefirms that provide guarantees and thus their inclusion in the rule wouldnot increase the number of potential providers of assurance.2. <T3>Combinations of Mechanisms. </T3>Under the proposed rule, any combinationof allowable financial assurance mechanisms could be used to demonstratefinancial responsibility for corrective action and third-party compensation.Commenters in general supported this approach.In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Agency discussed a ``double-counting''problem that may arise when a financial test is combined with a guaranteeprovided by a corporate parent. In many cases, the reported net worth ofa corporate parent includes the net worth of its subsidiaries. If a subsidiaryuses the financial test (based on its own net worth) in combination witha parent guarantee (based on the parent's net worth), the subsidiary'sassets available to cover UST obligations will be double counted. Thisdouble-counting will exaggerate the reserves available to the subsidiaryand the parent to cover UST obligations and thus may provide inadequatefinancial assurance. To avoid this problem, the Agency suggested that,in cases where a financial test is combined with a guarantee, the financialinformation supporting the two instruments cannot be drawn from consolidatedstatements.One commenter objected to the Agency proposal on two counts. First, thecommenter pointed out that the Agency did not include the prohibition againstconsolidated financial statements in cases of a combined financial testand guarantee in the proposed rule itself, but only in the preamble. Second,the commenter stated that preparing unconsolidated financial statementswould be costly for many firms and would effectively require firms to revealgenerally confidential, unconsolidated data. The commenter recommendedthat some other means be found to address the double-counting problem ofa combined financial test and guarantee.Despite this last objection, the Agency has decided to incorporate in thefinal rule (andSection; 280.94(c)) the restriction on the use of consolidatedfinancial statements in support of a financial test and guarantee combination.While the Agency acknowledges that this provision may impose costs on thosefinancial test users that do not routinely prepare statements that arenot consolidated with those of their guarantors, commenters have not suggestedan alternative and the Agency sees no other simple way to ensure that acombined financial test and guarantee offers the full amount of net worthcoverage that the Agency is requiring. If the costs of preparing unconsolidatedstatements and of revealing confidential business information outweighthe benefits of using a combined financial test and guarantee, then ownersor operators have other financial assurance mechanisms available.EPA does agree, however, that the restriction on the use of consolidatedfinancial statements should be formalized in the rule itself and has accordinglyadded this provision at andSection; 280.94(c).3. <T3>Attorney General Certification (andSection; 280.94(b))_ </T3>The proposedrule required that a guarantee, indemnity contract, or surety bond havea certification by the Attorney General of any state where the tanks beingassured are located that the mechanism is valid and enforceable in thatstate. This provision was designed to ensure that the mechanisms satisfynecessary contractual formalities or requirements of a state's laws.Several commenters objected to the requirement for an Attorney General'scertification. They maintained that state Attorneys General will find the``valid and enforceable'' standard unacceptable and that they do not possessthe statutory authority to issue such a certification. Another commenterclaimed that the certification is unnecessary because the ``ultra vires''defense is essentially untenable and the right of third parties to enforcesuch instruments is a commonly accepted legal principle.The Agency disagrees with the commenters' concern over the certificationissue. First, state Attorneys General have indicated their willingnessto provide ``valid and enforceable'' certifications required for the RCRASubtitle C corporate guarantee for liability coverage (40 CFR 264.147(g)and 265.147(g)). Of a group of state Attorneys General surveyed regardingthe Subtitle C corporate guarantee for liability coverage, no respondingAttorney General refused to issue a certification for this corporate guaranteebased on a lack of statutory authority. However, several Attorneys Generalindicated that such a request could only be made through a state agency.Second, the surety bond and guarantee authorized in today's rule may besubject to the insurance laws and regulations of certain states. Althoughthe ``ultra vires'' defense is generally no longer considered tenable,the Attorney General certification requirement ensures that any contractualformalities unique to a particular state have been addressed in the contractualagreement and that questions concerning the validity of the agreement willnot delay the provision of funding for corrective action. The Agency recognizesthat some states may require minor changes to the wording of the instrumentsto ensure that they are valid and enforceable under the laws of the state.The final rule requires submission of a letter by the Attorney Generalof a state verifying the validity and enforceability of the guarantee andsurety bond before these mechanisms may be used to demonstrate financialresponsibility.4. <T3>New Mechanisms. </T3>Many commenters advocated adding a mechanism underwhich the Federal government provides some form of financial assurance.The suggested forms for this mechanism ranged from a Federal fund to someform of Federal insurance pool. Several commenters advocated a Federal insurance program to offer liabilityinsurance at a reasonable price. One commenter supported a program similarto the Federally-run Flood Insurance Program under which premiums are paidby member corporations. However, another commenter said this approach wouldnot work, because insured parties would not want to subsidize other partieswith USTs installed over vulnerable ground-water areas. Several other commenters advocated various forms of Federal funds. Onesuggested approach was to establish a loan fund from which owners or operatorscould borrow at no interest and repay over a 25-year period. Another suggestionwas to establish a fund to cover events that cost between some establishedamount that reflects average remedy costs and one million dollars. Underthis approach, the fund would only be available to owners and operatorswho demonstrate responsible monitoring and leak prevention practices. In the SARA amendments to Subtitle I, Congress has established a $500 millionLeaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund for addressing releasesfrom petroleum USTs. However, after the effective date of the technicalstandards, use of the Trust Fund is authorized by RCRA section 9003(h)only in the following limited circumstances: (1) A responsible owner oroperator capable of taking prompt and appropriate corrective action cannotbe identified; (2) prompt action is required to protect human health andthe environment; (3) the cost of the corrective action exceeds the financialresponsibility requirements established under this rule and expenditureof additional funds is necessary; and (4) the owner or operator has failedor refused to comply with a corrective action order. (Uses of the Fundare discussed in more detail in Section IV.B.) The Fund may not be usedfor the purposes suggested by the commenters. Nor is EPA authorized underSubtitle I to develop another fund for any of the purposes suggested bythe commenters. In addition, one of the Agency's major goals reflected throughout the entireUST regulatory program is to encourage development of the UST program asa state-implemented program. EPA encourages states to consider developingthe type of funds that commenters urged should be undertaken by the Federalgovernment. Several different types of state funds or state-backed insuranceprograms can serve as assurance mechanisms to allow owners and operatorsto comply with the financial responsibility rule. In addition, state fundsmay provide valuable assistance and incentives to the regulated communityto comply with the new tank performance standards. 5. <T3>Specification of Tanks in Financial Assurance Instruments. </T3>Inthe proposed rule, the Agency required that the financial assurance instrumentslist by identification number the specific tanks that they cover. Manycommenters addressing specific mechanisms argued that this requirementis unnecessary and could in fact limit coverage or delay payment from theassurance mechanism. They felt that listing tanks individually could leadto contention as to which tanks was the source of release. This final rule requires the listing of facilities where assured tanksare located rather than the tanks themselves. The Agency has concludedthat listing of tanks at a facility where all tanks are assured under asingle mechanism is unnecessary. A listing by facility should also providegreater certainty concerning which tanks at a given location are coveredby the policy. Moreover, listing tanks by facility also prevents delaysin payment that might arise if coverage were triggered only after identificationof the particular tank that had caused the damage. In today's rule the language of the assurance instruments is amended tostrike the requirement for tank identification numbers and add a statementindicating that the required aggregate coverage levels have been purchased.Each instrument must identify each facility covered by the mechanism andthe number of tanks at each facility. If separate mechanisms are used tocover different USTs at one location, the tanks covered by each mechanismmust be identified in the wording of the mechanism.F. Financial Test of Self-Insurance (andSection; 280.95)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Financial Test</ITAG>As part of the underground storage tank requirements proposed on April17, 1987, EPA included a financial test that could be used by owners andoperators to self-insure. UST owners or operators able to meet the proposedfinancial test criteria would not be required to obtain insurance or anotherfinancial assurance mechanism to demonstrate evidence of their financialresponsibility for corrective action and third-party claims arising fromUST releases. The financial test of self-insurance was also proposed asa means to qualify guarantors and indemnitors of firms owning or operatingUSTs.As originally proposed, the Subtitle I financial test consisted of thefollowing criteria:a. The firm must have a tangible net worth equal to at least 10 times theamount of aggregate assurance required for UST financial assurance. Theproposed amount of required aggregate assurance ranged from $1 millionto $6 million, depending on the number of tanks the owner or operator,guarantor, or indemnitor was assuring for EPA or an authorized state. Ifthe firm was also using a financial test to meet the financial responsibilityrequirements for the costs of closure, post-closure care, liability coverage,and/or corrective action at a Subtitle C facility, or for the costs ofplugging and abandonment at a Class I Hazardous Waste Injection Well, thefirm was required to have a tangible net worth equal to at least 10 timesthe sum of these costs plus the required aggregated coverage for its USTs.b. The firm must have a tangible net worth of at least $10 million.c. The firm must either file annual financial statements with the SEC orannually report the firm's tangible net worth to Dun and Bradstreet (Dandamp;B),which must have assigned the firm a financial strength rating of 4A or5A.d. The firm's year-end financial statements, if independently audited,could not include an adverse auditor's opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.In addition to these financial test criteria, the proposed requirementsincluded procedures for financial test reporting and certification. Within90 days after the close of each fiscal year, the chief financial officerof the firm owning, operating, guaranteeing, or indemnifying had to signa letter reporting the year-end financial information supporting the firm'suse of the financial test. If an owner or operator, guarantor, or indemnitorfound at the end of the fiscal year that he was no longer eligible to usea financial test, the owner or operator was required to obtain an alternatemechanism within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year. Finally, the proposedrule authorized the Regional Administrator to disqualify a firm's use ofthe financial test if he found, based on reports of the firm's financialcondition, that the firm no longer met the financial test requirements.The owner or operator would have 30 days after notification of such a findingto obtain another financial assurance mechanism.The criteria for the proposed Subtitle I test reflected several key Agencyobjectives. First, the reliance of the test principally on a net worthmeasure was intended to keep the test relatively simple to administer andmonitor, in view of the large number of firms to be regulated under SubtitleI requirements. At the same time, the net worth criteria were designedto ensure that virtually all firms able to pass the test would also beable to meet their UST obligations. In particular, the requirement thatfirms demonstrate a level of net worth 10 times the size of their potentialUST obligations was based on an Agency analysis of failure rates amongfirms classified on the basis of their ratios of UST liabilities to networth. The Agency found that, for those firms with UST liabilities equalto 10 percent or less of their net worth, the associated probability ofbankruptcy was approximately one percent. Therefore, to achieve a levelof assurance such that no more than one percent of financial test userswould go bankrupt as a result of their UST obligations, the Agency decidedto require that financial test users maintain their net worth at a levelat least 10 times their environmental obligations.By requiring that other environmental obligations assured by a financialtest be aggregated with the required UST assurance when determining theamount of net worth to require, the Agency wished to prevent financialtest users from diluting the degree of assurance provided by the test.Similarly, the requirement that there be no auditor's disclaimer of opinionor adverse opinion was also intended to increase the margin of securityprovided by the test. A disclaimer of opinion or an adverse opinion indicatesthat the auditor has found material uncertainties regarding the firm'svaluation of its assets, current litigation or tax liabilities, or changesin accounting method. Therefore, because these opinions indicate that thereported net worth of a firm may be greater than its actual net worth,there is considerable doubt as to whether a firm receiving a disclaimerof opinion or an adverse opinion has sufficient resources to meet its USTobligations.Finally, the requirement that firms either file their financial statementswith the SEC or report to Dandamp;B and obtain a Dandamp;B financial strengthrating of 4A or 5A was meant to ensure that the information used to supporta financial test would be publicly available and therefore easily verifiedby EPA or state regulators. At the same time, by allowing a Dandamp;B ratingas an alternative to filing with the SEC, the Agency wished to make thetest available to the large number of privately-held UST owners and operatorswho would not otherwise be submitting their financial statements to theSEC.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Comments on the Proposed Financial Test</ITAG>EPA received comments on its proposed Subtitle I financial test from awide representation of firms and entities that will be affected by theUST requirements. These included both publicly- and privately-held firms,municipalities, trade associations, environmental groups, state regulatoryagencies, and firms representing all aspects of UST ownership: owners ofa single tank or many tanks, petroleum refiners and marketers, and firmsengaged in businesses other than petroleum production, refining, or marketing.The majority of comments focused on (1) the net worth criteria of the financialtest; (2) requirements for financial test certification and reporting;and (3) the ability of municipalities to use the test. Comments were alsoreceived on a number of miscellaneous issues, such as the aggregation ofother environmental costs with the required level of UST coverage; theuse of a binding guarantee to support the financial test; and the extensionof the aggregate schedule for owners or operators using a financial testto assure a large number of USTs. The substance of the major comments receivedis briefly summarized below, followed by the Agency's rationale for acceptingor rejecting commenters' recommendations in the final financial test requirements.a. <T3>Net Worth Criteria of the Financial Test.</T3> Many commenters objectedthat the proposed financial test would not be available to any but thelargest petroleum distributors or refiners and therefore recommended thatthe net worth criteria of the test be relaxed to allow smaller businessesto use the test. Other commenters argued that a lower net worth multiplewas appropriate in view of the fact that the proposed per-occurrence andaggregate amounts of coverage were much higher than the average costs ofUST releases. Commenters also questioned why a 10 times net worth multiplewas proposed for Subtitle I, when a six times net worth multiple is requiredfor the Subtitle C tests for closure and post-closure care and liabilitycoverage.The Agency agrees that the availability of the financial test will be limitedto larger firms in the regulated community; nevertheless, EPA also believesthat this restriction is necessary to increase the likelihood that a financialtest user will be able to pay for its potential UST obligations. Becausethe incidence of bankruptcy among firms with less than $10 million in tangiblenet worth is approximately two times as great as the bankruptcy rate amongfirms with more than $10 million in tangible net worth, the Agency hasdecided to retain the minimum $10 million tangible net worth requirementin the final rule.For similar reasons, the Agency has also decided to retain the requirementthat tangible net worth be at least 10 times the required UST aggregatefor any firm using the financial test. Lowering the net worth multiplewould mean that more than one percent of financial test users would bepredicted to fail without funding their UST obligations_a risk that theAgency does not believe should be accepted among financial test users,particularly since owners or operators who use any of the other financialassurance mechanisms allowable under Subtitle I (insurance, surety bond,etc.) pose little risk of incurring unfunded UST obligations.Other changes are, however, being made in the final UST rule that shouldmake the 10 times level of net worth somewhat less restrictive to potentialfinancial test users. First, the schedule of required annual aggregateshas been modified (see Section III.D), so that the maximum annual aggregateto be assured is $2 million rather than $6 million as originally proposed.Thus, without changing the net worth requirement, the corresponding levelof required net worth will nevertheless be lower for many firms owningand operating large numbers of USTs.Second, the Agency has incorporated into the final rule (andSection; 280.95(c))a second set of financial test criteria that may be used instead of theoriginally proposed ``net worth'' test. Owners or operators may now chooseto use the financial test criteria of the Subtitle C test for liabilitycoverage, as specified in andSection; 264.147(f)(1) or andSection; 265.147(f)(1),to demonstrate their ability to pay for their UST obligations. These criteriaare included in the final rule as Alternative II, while the originallyproposed financial test is retained as Alternative I. As a result of thisaddition, firms with a tangible net worth of $10 million and <T3>six </T3>times their UST obligations will be able to use a financialtest under Alternative II, as long as they also have:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; At least 90 percent of their assets in the United States,or U.S. assets at least six times their UST obligations; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Net working capital at least six times the required amountof UST aggregate coverage; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A current Standard and Poor's bond rating of AAA, AA, A,or BBB, or a current Moody's bond rating of Aaa, Aa, A, or Ba.</ITAG>As with Alternative I of the Subtitle I financial test, if the firm isusing a financial test to assure the costs of closure, post-closure care,corrective action, liability coverage, and/or plugging and abandonmentcosts at a Class I Hazardous Waste Injection Well, then the multiple requirementsof Alternative II must be applied to the sum of these costs plus the UST-requiredannual aggregate. EPA believes the two tests provide equivalent assurancesof financial strength.EPA has decided to adopt this Alternative II financial test in additionto Alternative I as a way of increasing the availability of the financialtest without jeopardizing the level of assurance provided by the test.As designed for the Subtitle C liability test, and now for the UST AlternativeII test, the requirement that either 90 percent of a firm's assets be inthe United States or that U.S. assets be at least six times its UST obligationis intended to ensure the accessibility of these assets, should the firmrequire them to meet its UST costs. The net working capital requirementis designed to measure the adequacy of a firm's liquid resources, giventhe potential level of its environmental obligations. Because, however,the level of net working capital can vary significantly by industry, theAgency allows firms to meet the bond rating requirement as an alternativeto the net working capital requirement. Thus, financially healthy firmsthat typically maintain relatively low levels of working capital due tothe nature of their business can nevertheless use the bond rating alternativeto demonstrate that they have adequate liquid resources to meet their obligations.The Agency decided to use the financial test criteria of the Subtitle Ctest for liability coverage for the UST financial test because they werespecifically designed for assurance of possible, rather than certain, costs.For this reason, these criteria are somewhat less stringent than the standardsof the Subtitle C closure and post-closure test where future costs thatare certain to be incurred are being assured. Furthermore, the criteriaselected for the Alternative II test have the advantage of being easilyobtained from public sources even for those firms that do not have auditedfinancial statements or do not report to the SEC. b. <T3>Requirements for Certification and Reporting</T3>. EPA received twocomments endorsing the Agency's proposal not to require firms using thefinancial test to obtain a special auditor's report verifying the financialtest information contained in the chief financial officer's report. Othercommenters, however, objected to the proposed requirements for financialtest certification and reporting on the grounds that such requirementswere unnecessarily burdensome and restrictive. Specific objections to thereporting and certification requirements are summarized below, followedby the Agency's response to each of these objections. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The requirement that the chief financial officer list inhis annual letter every tank being assured by the financial test wouldbe especially time-consuming for owners and operators of a large numberof tanks. </ITAG>EPA agrees that the requirement for individual tank listing in the chieffinancial officer's letter may impose an unnecessary recordkeeping burdenon firms with many USTs or on firms that frequently change their inventoryof USTs. The Agency has therefore adopted in the final rule the suggestionthat financial test users list the sites or facilities where their tanksare located, rather than each tank. (This same suggestion has been adoptedfor all the financial assurance mechanisms in the final rule; see SectionIII.E.5.) If, however, separate mechanisms or combinations of mechanismsare used to assure different sets of USTs at a location, individual tanksmust still be identified. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Other ratings, such as a Moody's or a Standard and Poor'srating, should be allowed as a substitute for a Dandamp;B rating as partof the financial test criteria. </ITAG>EPA has decided not to allow a bond rating from Moody's or Standard andPoor (Sandamp;P) as part of the Alternative I test, because these ratingscannot be used in the same way as Dandamp;B ratings or SEC reports_namely,to verify that a firm has at least $10 million in net worth. The Agencyhas, nevertheless, incorporated requirements for a Moody's or Sandamp;P bondrating in the Alternative II test: Under andSection;280.95(c)(1), a financialtest user may either demonstrate that it has net working capital at leastsix times the required amount of UST aggregate coverage or that its mostrecent bond issue has received an investment grade bond rating from Moody'sor Sandamp;P. As such, the bond ratings are intended to increase the availabilityof the test to those firms that are financially strong, but because ofthe nature of their business, do not routinely maintain high levels ofworking capital. The bond ratings are <T3>not</T3>, however, intended to provide evidence of the level of a firm'snet worth. In the Alternative II test, this purpose is instead accomplishedby the requirement that a firm either report to the SEC, the Energy InformationAdministration, or the Rural Electrification Administration, in which caseits net worth can be easily verified in the reports publicly availablefrom these agencies, or submit a special auditor's report, corroboratingthe firm's declaration that it has at least $10 million in tangible networth. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The annual reports filed by utilities with the Energy InformationAdministration and by rural electric cooperatives with the Rural ElectrificationAdministration are publicly available. The Agency should allow reportingto one of these agencies as a substitute for reporting to the SEC. </ITAG>The Agency agrees with these commenters. Because the annual reports filedby utilities with the Energy Information Administration and by rural electriccooperatives with the Rural Electrification Administration are publiclyavailable and equivalent to annual reports filed with the SEC, the Agencywill allow an annual report to one of these two agencies to substitutefor reporting to the SEC. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The 90-day deadline for filing financial test informationafter the firm's fiscal year end is inconvenient in view of other deadlinesfor filing with public agencies. </ITAG>EPA recognizes that filing with the SEC is a time-consuming process, involvingthe compilation and verification of large amounts of financial data. Becausethe UST financial test relies on the same information that is reportedto the SEC, many firms will not be able to prepare their financial testsubmission until they have first completed the SEC filing. Furthermore,the deadline for the annual reports filed by utilities with the EnergyInformation Administration is April 30 (i.e., 119 days after the end ofthe calendar year), whereas there is no strict deadline for filing withthe Rural Electrification Administration. In view of these considerations,the Agency has decided to extend the deadline for completing the UST financialtest by an additional 30 days. This means that the financial test informationis now required to be completed 120 days after the end of the firm's reportingyear, rather than 90 days, as originally proposed. With this change, thepreparation of the UST financial test information should not add significantlyto the reporting burden of firms. Given this extension of the reporting deadline, the Agency has also decidedto extend the deadline for obtaining a new financial assurance mechanismfor those firms that find that they can no longer use a financial test.The final rule now requires that firms must obtain alternative coveragewithin 150 days of the end of the year reported in their annual financialstatements if these statements indicate that they no longer meet the financialtest criteria (andSection; 280.95(e)). This 150-day period is based on theexpectation that firms will need up to 120 days after the close of theirreporting year to compile their financial information and an additional30 days to find an alternate mechanism if this information does not supportrenewing their financial test. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The proposed rule did not clearly define the authority givento the Regional Administrator to request further information from financialtest users. </ITAG>EPA has retained in the final rule the proposed provision authorizing theDirector of the implementing agency to require reports of financial conditionat any time from a financial test user and to disallow use of the financialtest if these reports demonstrate that the financial test criteria areno longer being met (andSection; 280.95(f)). In response to commenters' concernthat such authority could be used arbitrarily to disqualify the use ofthe test by some firms, the Agency emphasizes that the information requestedby the Director of the Implementing Agency could be used only to verifycompliance with the financial test requirements as they are promulgatedunder andSection; 280.95 (b) or (c) and (d). Generally, such informationwould include unaudited interim financial statements (such as 10-Qs submittedto the SEC) or mid-year restatements of financial information (such as8-Ks submitted to the SEC). Any information not bearing on the requirementsspecified in the financial test would not be used to disqualify an owneror operator. The Agency has modified the wording of this provision to makeits intention clearer in this respect. <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Reporting of financial information to EPA could result inanti-competitive activity because EPA is under no obligation to keep suchinformation confidential. </ITAG>EPA does not believe that the financial test reporting requirements willin any way violate a financial test user's interest in keeping informationconfidential, because the test relies only on information that is alreadyreported to other organizations that make this information publicly available.Furthermore, the financial assurance rules do not require regular reportingof information to EPA, but instead require that owners or operators maintaina record of this information at their place of business. In summary, the Agency emphasizes that the reporting and certificationrequirements for the Alternative I financial test are designed to be minimallyburdensome to firms, while still ensuring that financial test informationcan be verified through sources other than the owner or operator. Becausefirms will be allowed to meet the test requirements by reporting theirnet worth to Dun andamp; Bradstreet as an alternative to reporting to theSEC, the Energy Information Administration, or the Rural ElectrificationAdministration, financial test users will not necessarily be required tohave audited financial statements. For owners and operators who opt forthe Alternative II financial test, however, the reporting and certificationrequirements are stricter. Specifically, Alternative II requires that thefinancial statements of an owner or operator using the financial test beindependently audited. EPA considers this requirement to be necessary inthe case of Alternative II because of the type of information called forby the test_namely, the level of net working capital and the level of U.S.assets. The measurement of these variables can differ substantially accordingto the accounting method used to prepare financial statements. By requiringthat the financial statements of Alternative II test users be independentlyaudited, EPA has, at a minimum, the assurance that these variables willbe measured in a relatively consistent and conservative fashion and inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Furthermore, in the final rule, Alternative II requires a special auditor'sreport from those firms that do not file their statements with the SEC,the Energy Information Administration, or the Rural Electrification Administration.The reason for this requirement is to provide the Agency with some objectivemeasure of the validity of the information reported by those firms whosefinancial information may not otherwise be publicly available. Thus, thisrequirement serves the same basic purposes as the Dandamp;B rating that isincluded as part of the Alternative I financial test. c. <T3>Availability of the Financial Test to Municipalities. </T3>Many commenterson EPA's proposed financial test requirements pointed out that the testwas designed for use by private corporations and not by municipalitiesor other governmental entities. In particular, the reliance of the teston measures of net worth makes it inappropriate for use by most municipalitiessince net worth is generally not a meaningful or readily measurable indicatorof a government entity's ability to meet its obligations. Only for thosespecial purpose municipalities, whose operations and accounting proceduresare similar to those of a privately owned firm, is ``net worth'' a meaningfulindicator of financial condition. Commenters also noted that the proposedfinancial test reporting requirements were inapplicable to those municipalitiesthat do not file financial statements with the SEC or report their networth to Dandamp;B. As discussed in Section III.A.4., the Agency intends to propose a financialtest for local government entities. Under this test, qualifying local governmententities would be able to demonstrate that they are capable of self-insuringthe costs of cleanup and third-party liability associated with UST releases,and thus do not need to obtain a separate financial assurance mechanism.d. <T3>Miscellaneous Issues Concerning the Proposed Financial Test. </T3>Inthe preamble to the April 17, 1987, proposed Subtitle I financial test,EPA requested comments on two requirements under consideration for inclusionin the final rule: (1) A requirement that firms issue a binding writtenguarantee that they will pay for the corrective action and third-partyobligations that they were assuring with a financial test or through provisionof a guarantee or indemnity contract; and (2) a requirement extending theaggregate schedule beyond the required maximum for financial test users.One commenter objected to the proposal to incorporate a binding writtenguarantee into the financial test criteria on the grounds that it couldresult in lower bond ratings for firms and increased interest costs ontheir debt, which in turn would impair firms' abilities to demonstratefinancial assurance. Commenters also questioned whether such a guaranteewould materially improve EPA's ability to obtain the required funding forUST obligations in the event of a firm's bankruptcy. In view of these comments,EPA has decided not to incorporate a requirement for a binding guaranteein the financial test provisions of the final rule.With respect to extending the aggregate schedule for financial test users,some commenters considered that this provision would be unfair to large,financially viable firms who seek to assure their obligations with a financialtest. The Agency's original intention in making such a suggestion was tolimit the ability of financial test users to assure thousands of tankson the strength of a limited net worth. Because the required aggregateis capped, it would be possible for a firm to add to the number of tanksit was assuring by means of the financial test without having to increaseits required level of net worth. The Agency, however, has decided thatextending the aggregate schedule is not necessary for financial test usersassuring large numbers of USTs. As indicated above in discussing the aggregateschedule, those few firms that assure hundreds or thousands of USTs arealso firms with resources that are substantial and more than sufficientto cover their obligations. Moreover, these same firms are likely to havegood loss prevention programs to limit their potentially large liability.Other comments received on the proposed financial test criteria includedobjections to the Agency's proposal to require, for purposes of the SubtitleI financial test, that an owner or operator add to the required UST aggregateany other environmental costs for which a financial test is used to demonstratefinancial assurance. Commenters questioned why a ten times net worth multiplewould be applied to the sum of these costs under Subtitle I, while underthe provisions of the Subtitle C test, a six times net worth multiple isrequired for coverage of all costs being assured by a financial test.The Agency believes that this addition of costs is necessary to ensurethat an UST owner or operator can meet all of its environmental obligationswithout jeopardizing the financial health of the firm. The financial testsused for closure and post-closure care, liability coverage, and correctiveaction all rely on a measure of a firm's net worth relative to the costsbeing assured. If, therefore, these costs were not added together in theUST financial test for purposes of determining the required amount of networth, UST owners or operators would, in effect, be ``double pledging''their financial resources, thereby reducing the likelihood that UST obligationscould be met if they were also faced with other environmental costs.One commenter recommended that a firm owning or operating USTs and usinga financial test to assure Subtitle C obligations should be required tohave a tangible net worth equal to the sum of <T3>10 </T3>times the applicable UST aggregate plus <T3>six </T3>times the applicable Subtitle C costs, rather than a tangiblenet worth equal to 10 times the sum of all costs assured by a financialtest, as the Agency proposed. It was argued that this procedure for determiningthe magnitude of net worth coverage for multiple environmental obligationswas more consistent with the Subtitle C financial test requirements, whichuse a six times net worth multiple. However, for reasons discussed in SectionIII.F.2.a. above, the Agency continues to believe that, for the purposesof the Alternative I financial test, a requirement that net worth coveragebe fully 10 times <T3>all </T3>costs being assured by a financial test is necessary to maintainthe level of protection that the Agency has set as the standard for theSubtitle I test. The Alternative II financial test, by contract, requiresthat net worth coverage be at least six times all environmental costs beingassured by a financial test. This lower net worth coverage is acceptablein the context of the Alternative II test because the test requires firmsto meet other criteria indicative of financial strength that are not includedin the Alternative I test.Another set of recommendations received by EPA urged the Agency to makethe Subtitle I test more consistent with the Subtitle C financial test.In one case, a commenter recommended that the Subtitle I test adopt thesame procedure for calculating tangible net worth as is currently usedfor the Subtitle C test for closure and post-closure care (andSection; 264.151(f)and (g)). Under this procedure, any of the costs being assured by the testthat have been incorporated in the measure of a firm's liabilities canbe subtracted from the liability total and added to net worth. Becausegenerally accepted accounting principles require that firms accrue as liabilitiesthose future costs that are reasonably certain and measurable, those firmswith known future environmental obligations are required to count theseobligations as part of their liabilities. The net worth (or differencebetween total assets and total liabilities) of such firms will be decreasedcorrespondingly by the amount of the accrued liability. Thus, generallyaccepted accounting procedures measure net worth as if known future obligationshad already been paid for or discharged. However, the purpose of the networth criteria in a financial test is to measure the net worth resourcesavailable to a firm <T3>before </T3>it incurs an environmental cost, and thereby to determinewhether the firm can meet this cost without jeopardizing its ability tomeet other unanticipated obligations. For the Subtitle C test, EPA thereforebelieved that the appropriate procedure for measuring a firm's availableresources was to compute net worth before adjusting for those liabilitiesthat the test is being used to assure. EPA believes that the same reasoningis applicable to the Subtitle I test and, therefore, allows in the finalrule any UST costs that have been accrued as part of total liabilitiesto be subtracted from the sum of total liabilities and added back to networth. The Agency has adopted this procedure for purposes of both the AlternativeI and the Alternative II UST financial tests.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Summary of Changes in the Financial Test</ITAG>As discussed in Section 2 above, the Agency has made a number of changesto the Subtitle I financial test, proposed on April 17, 1987, largely inresponse to the comments received on the proposal. These changes are brieflysummarized below.a. <T3>Alternative Financial Test Option. </T3>In addition to the originallyproposed Subtitle I test, the Agency is allowing UST owners and operatorswho wish to use a financial test to meet the criteria of the Subtitle Ctest for liability coverage. Under this option, owners or operators, and/orguarantors, would be required to demonstrate the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A tangible net worth of at least $10 million;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A tangible net worth of at least six times the amount ofthe applicable UST aggregate;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; U.S. assets at least 90 percent of total assets, or U.S.assets at least six times the amount of the applicable UST aggregate; andeither:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Net working capital at least six times the applicable USTaggregate, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A current bond rating for the most recent bond issue of AAA,AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's, or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa asissued by Moody's.</ITAG>In addition, firms using this alternative must have independently auditedfinancial statements and cannot have an auditor's adverse opinion, disclaimerof opinion, or going concern qualification. For those firms that do notfile their financial statements with the SEC, the Energy Information Administrationor the Rural Electrification Administration, a special auditor's report,which compares the financial information reported in the test submissionto the firm's financial statements and certifies that there are no materialdifferences between the two, is also required. b. <T3>Disallowance of a Financial Test if a ``Going Concern'' QualificationIs Received on a Firm's Financial Statements. </T3>In the proposal, theAgency stipulated that, if the financial statements of a financial testuser had been independently audited, they could not carry an adverse opinionby an independent certified public accountant or a disclaimer of opinion.In the final rule, the Agency has decided to add a ``going concern'' qualificationto the types of auditor's opinions that will disqualify a firm from usinga financial test. Because a ``going concern'' qualification indicates thatthere is a question about the ability of a firm to stay in business, theAgency does not believe such firms should be allowed to rely on their ownresources to cover their UST obligations.c. <T3>Reporting to the Energy Information Administration or the Rural ElectrificationAdministration. </T3>The final rule allows utilities filing annual reportswith the Energy Information Administration and rural electric cooperativesfiling annual reports with the Rural Electrification Administration touse the financial test.d. <T3>Listing of Locations of Covered USTs. </T3>The financial test, likeall of the financial assurance mechanisms in the final rule, does not requireidentification of individual tanks at the locations assured by the financialtest unless the financial test is only being used to cover some of theUSTs at one location.e. <T3>Extending the Deadline for Preparing the Financial Test. </T3>The finalrule allows firms using a financial test 120 days from the end of theirreporting year to prepare their UST financial test. In EPA's original proposal,the chief financial officer of the firm had to sign the financial testdocumentation within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year. The finalrule also allows owners or operators who can no longer use a financialtest 150 days from the end of the reporting year to obtain alternativemeans of financial assurance. In the event that an owner or operator failsto obtain alternative assurance, he must notify the Director of the implementingagency within 10 days. In the proposed rule, only 120 days were allowedto obtain an alternative mechanism.f. <T3>Procedures for Determining Tangible Net Worth. </T3>In the final rule,the Agency has adopted the procedure for calculating a firm's tangiblenet worth from the Subtitle C financial test for closure and post-closurecare. With this procedure, firms are allowed to deduct from their totalliabilities any accruals for costs that are being assured by the financialtest. This deduction can then be added to the measure of tangible net worth.G. Guarantee (andSection; 280.96) and Indemnity ContractThe final rule, unlike the proposed rule, allows only one form of financialassurance by which a firm promises to pay the specified amounts for correctiveaction or third-party liability for another firm: a guarantee (andSection;280.96). Indemnities, which were included in the proposed rule, are notauthorized in the final rule. EPA based its decision not to authorize theindemnity on the following rationale.Many commenters on the proposed rule noted that authorization of an indemnityas an allowable mechanism to provide financial assurance in this regulatorycontext would seem to endorse practices which, in the past, required somepetroleum product marketers to indemnify their suppliers. Although theAgency's proposed authorization was not intended to endorse any other useof indemnities, the Agency believes that dropping the indemnity will preventany possible misunderstanding.Moreover, in order to cover third-party liability, indemnities duplicateso closely the structure and operation of a guarantee contract that, ineffect, no additional financial assurance option is added by includingindemnities. In fact, their inclusion may create unnecessary confusionbecause, in the petroleum marketing industry, indemnities have been usedin a very different context. Commenters on the proposal indicated that,in the past, petroleum product marketers have often been required by theircontracts to indemnify their suppliers, rather than looking to them forindemnities and guarantees. Finally, because the same kinds of firms arelikely to be guarantors and indemnitors, indemnities do not provide theregulated community with an additional group of potential financial assuranceproviders. For these reasons, the Agency authorizes guarantees in today'srule but not indemnities.A guarantee is a promise by one party (the guarantor) to pay specifieddebts or satisfy the specified obligations of another party (the principal)in the event the principal fails to satisfy the debts or obligations. Underthe final rule, a guarantee may be provided by related firms or by unrelatedfirms that have a substantial business relationship with the owner or operator.The obligation between the owner or operator (the principal), the implementingagency, or third parties rests on regulatory requirements and potentialtort liability. If the owner or operator fails to perform corrective actionor satisfy certified third-party claims, the guarantor agrees to fund astandby trust from which the implementing agency will direct the paymentof corrective action costs or third-party claims.Guarantors must demonstrate that they are qualified to provide financialassurance by satisfying the Alternative I or Alternative II financial testunder andSection; 280.95, described in Section III.F. Also, to ensure thatstate insurance laws do not call into question the enforceability or validityof the mechanism, the guarantee can be used only if it is certified asvalid and enforceable by the Attorney General of the state where the USTscovered by the mechanism are located.Many commenters questioned the availability of the guarantee, particularlyto small- and medium-size firms. These commenters were concerned that suchfirms would not have the required relationship with a potential guarantoror that a potential provider would be unable to satisfy the financial testrequirements. EPA's proposed rule included guarantees among a variety ofalternative mechanisms to provide owners and operators a number of complianceoptions. Although some segments of the regulated community will be unableto use the guarantee because of the rule's business relationship and financialtest requirements, the Agency continues to believe these requirements arenecessary to ensure that the guarantee provides adequate financial assurance.These provisions, therefore, remain unchanged in today's rule.The proposed rule allowed firms to provide a guarantee if they were relatedfirms that own a controlling interest in the owner or operator (parentfirms), firms that own a controlling interest in a parent firm of the ownerof operator (grandparent firms), or affiliated firms that are controlledby a parent that also owns a controlling interest in the owner or operator.As defined in andSection; 280.92(c), ``controlling interest'' means directownership of at least 50 percent of the voting stock. The proposal alsoallowed a firm engaged in a ``substantial business relationship'' withthe owner or operator to provide a guarantee as an act incidental to thatbusiness relationship. These firms were included to increase the numberof potential financial assurance providers without sacrificing the validityor enforceability of the instrument. Section 280.91(j) of the proposedrule defined a ``substantial business relationship'' to mean the businessrelationship necessary under applicable state law to make a guarantee issuedincident to the relationship valid and enforceable. A guarantee is consideredincident to such a relationship if it arises from and depends on existingeconomic transactions between the guarantor and the owner or operator.These required relationships between owners or operators and providersof guarantees were the subject of many comments. Several commenters praisedthe Agency for expanding the number and kinds of corporate affiliates thatare authorized to provide guarantees of financial assurance and urged evenfurther broadening in recognition of the variety of corporate structuresthat exist within some sectors of the regulated community such as electricutilities. One commenter suggested the broader definition of corporateaffiliates used in Federal securities law, which would include any firmthat, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls,or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the owner or operator.EPA's concern is to ensure that guarantees from corporate affiliates arevalid under appropriate state law and that sufficient unity of interestexists between the guarantor and the owner or operator to provide adequateassurance of financial responsibility. The proposed relationship requirementsare those that seem most likely to result in adequate assurance. A firmengaged in a substantial business relationship with the owner or operatorcan, however, provide a guarantee regardless of its position within thecorporate structure. Thus, the Agency will allow affiliates, such as thoseenumerated in the securities definition, that satisfy this criterion toprovide financial assurance as guarantors.The proposed rule required providers to use the contractual language specifiedin the rule for the guarantee. Some commenters expressed concern that theproposed wording of the guarantee instrument did not sufficiently limitthe providers' liability, particularly in the event of the bankruptcy ofthe owner or operator. The Agency believes that the required language explicitlylimits the obligation of the provider to the per-occurrence and aggregateamounts for corrective action and third-party liability as stated on theface of the instrument and that the wording, therefore, need not be modified.In addition, as discussed in Section III.V.2 of this preamble, the Agencyis incorporating certain exclusionary language into the terms of the guaranteeto more clearly limit the type and circumstances of third-party liabilityfor which this mechanism can be used. A provider may, however, have incurredobligations outside those of the guarantee contract, under state law orother contractual agreements with the owner or operator. Such legal obligationswill not be changed by the limitations in the guarantee.H. Insurance and Risk Retention Group Coverage (andSection; 280.97)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Availability</ITAG>Today's rule allows UST owners and operators to demonstrate financial responsibilitythrough the purchase of insurance. The Agency believes that for many ownersand operators, insurance will be the private mechanism of choice becauseit will be less costly and more available to most owners and operatorsthan the other commercial mechanisms. Many commenters expressed concern,however, that insurance would not be readily available, and many felt thatcoverage, if available, would not be offered at the levels required byEPA and that it would not be available to particular groups of owners andoperators.The Agency recognizes that the liability insurance market, particularlythe market for pollution liability coverage, has become restricted in recentyears. As many commenters pointed out, a number of factors have contributedto the current limited availability of liability insurance.The Agency also believes that despite the tight market, some insuranceis available for USTs and more may become available in the near future.Evidence from the commenters suggests that UST coverage is currently availablefrom a small number of specialty insurers, although some policies do notprovide the level and scope of coverage required in the rule. One majorprovider of UST coverage insures over 80,000 tanks at 25,000 locations.A major insurance broker has obtained coverage for over 1,500 petroleummarketers with more than 90,000 tanks at over 26,000 locations. EffectiveJuly 1, 1987, the company that wrote policies for this broker stopped writingnew policies or renewing existing policies. However, the broker is continuingto offer coverage through a RRG which has recently become licensed andwhich is currently offering policies. In addition to the petroleum marketerscurrently covered through existing policies, the RRG intends to extendcoverage eventually to many of the 78,000 open dealers who currently findit difficult to obtain insurance.Although UST insurance is most readily available to petroleum wholesalersand distributors, some non-marketers (e.g., auto dealers) have also beenable to purchase coverage. Many insurance companies that do not specializein pollution insurance nevertheless offer UST coverage to their policyholderswho purchase other lines of commercial liability coverage. A major supplierof insurance to petroleum marketers also issues policies to non-marketerspurchasing other liability lines. Three other major insurers also reportedthat they provide UST coverage to some non-marketers.The market for UST coverage has improved somewhat since the financial responsibilityregulations were proposed on April 17, 1987. Two new UST insurers haveentered the market (one of whom offers coverage to non-marketers) and anexisting insurer, who had provided coverage in only a few states, has expandedto offer coverage in all fifty states. This insurer also offers coverageto single station owners. Two insurers already offering other pollutionliability lines have indicated that they are considering offering UST coverageas well.The Agency is aware that the availability of coverage at the per-occurrencelimits required in the statute and today's rule is limited. Recently, onemajor insurer lowered its per-occurrence limits from $1 million to $500,000.Its aggregate coverage levels remain at $2 million, enough aggregate coveragefor owners and operators with any number of tanks to meet the aggregaterequirement in the rule. The RRG discussed above has begun offering policieswith $750,000 per-occurrence limits and plans to offer $1 million limitswhen it becomes sufficiently capitalized. In addition, a number of insurersnot specializing in pollution liability coverage continue to offer coveragewith $1 million per-occurrence limits. While some of these insurers offeraggregate limits of only $1 million, in most cases these insurers providecoverage to owners or operators with fewer tanks for whom $1 million wouldbe adequate to meet the Agency's requirement. In some cases, owners andoperators may have to combine policies and other mechanisms to obtain therequired coverage.While the current insurance supply is inadequate to cover all members ofthe regulated community, the Agency hopes that the supply will expand inthe months between the promulgation of the regulations and the compliancedates for the majority of unassured USTs. As noted above, a slight expansionhas already occurred. The requirement to demonstrate financial responsibilityshould significantly increase the demand by owners and operators for USTinsurance. At the same time, promulgation of UST technical standards shouldincrease the ability of the insurance industry to predict its risk in offeringUST coverage. These two factors may increase the certainty of the profitabilityof insuring USTs and should encourage new entrants into the marketplace.The Agency further believes that 12 to 18 months is a reasonable time inwhich to expect the insurance industry to respond to the increased demandfor coverage and for alternatives to conventional insurance, like RRGsor state funds, to develop. Estimates of the time frames for establishingnew insurance programs and RRGs range from 12 to 36 months. Commenterson the Supplemental Notice generally agreed with the estimates, with onlyone commenter suggesting that it might take as long as 5 years for a RRGto form.Nevertheless, the Agency recognizes that some owners and operators mayhave difficulty obtaining insurance after the date set for compliance withthe rule. In particular, individual service station dealers who are notpart of an industry association may face such difficulties because USTpolicies are often sold through such associations, making it difficultfor unaffiliated owners or operators to obtain insurance on their own.Individual service station dealers and other UST owners and operators notcurrently members of larger groups or trade associations may have to formor join a group to facilitate purchase of UST coverage or the formationof a RRG. Alternatively they may be able to rely on a state fund.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Insurance Cost and Its Impact</ITAG>Many commenters felt that the cost of insurance for USTs would be prohibitivelyhigh and suggested that in considering the impact of the rule, the Agencyhad underestimated the cost of UST pollution liability policy premiums.Other commenters addressed issues concerning the high cost of insurancein general and felt that particular groups of owners and operators, especiallysmall businesses and local governments, would be adversely affected bythe regulations.The Agency believes that its projection of average premium costs of $2,000to $4,000 per facility is accurate. The estimate was developed based oncurrent and projected premiums using data supplied by insurers. The informationreceived in the comments supports this estimate. The proposed RRG notedabove reported that its average premium for $1 million peroccurrence coverageis expected to be $2,000 per site. Other current providers reported premiumsof $500 to $2,000 for coverage of one to twelve tanks. The largest averagepremiums were reported by the National Association of Convenience Stores(NACS) and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA).These trade associations reported average premiums of $13,600 and $32,000per member respectively. NACS and SIGMA members tend to own several locations,however, and there is likely to be more than one tank at each location.Forty percent of NACS members own more than 10 stores, while 47 percentof SIGMA members own 11 to 50 outlets and 39 percent own 51 or more. Giventhe large numbers of sites covered, the high NACS and SIGMA average premiumsare also in line with the Agency's original estimate.Reported claims data suggest that UST claims have been predictable andnot extremely costly. Most claims have been under $100,000. In addition,insurers can expect the risks of UST coverage to become more predictablein the future. While the cost of insurance for USTs could be relativelyhigh initially, particularly when the regulations first go into effect,the increased predictability and decreased risk that the technical regulationsare likely to promote should help to limit costs.The Agency recognizes that the cost of liability insurance in general maypose a hardship upon some members of the regulated community. However,average premiums of about $2,000 are small compared to the costs of correctiveaction which, if incurred, would certainly pose a much greater economichardship.The Agency received several comments with specific suggestions for alternativerequirements that might reduce the cost of obtaining insurance coveragefor USTs. One commenter suggested that a tank manufacturer's product liabilitypolicy might be extended to provide indemnification for tank owners oroperators. However, such a mechanism would present a number of difficultiesin meeting the financial responsibility requirements. Among the difficultieswould be setting a level of product liability insurance that would ensureindemnification of each tank purchaser at a level of $1 million. In addition,it is likely that the scope of product liability insurance coverage wouldbe unacceptably low (e.g., it would only cover releases caused by tankdefects). Also, administrative difficulties connected with securing paymentthrough a manufacturer's policy might delay cleanup. For example, a claimmight have to be made by first contacting the manufacturer who would thencontact the insurer. Therefore, the Agency declines to authorize such amechanism as a means of compliance with the regulations. The Agency recognizes,however, that tank manufacturers may act as guarantors for tank ownersor operators provided that they comply with the applicable requirementsof andSection; 280.96.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Viability of Risk Retention Groups</ITAG>Commenters raised a number of issues concerning the viability of risk retentiongroups (RRGs) as an alternative to traditional insurance coverage. Amongthe issues were: Difficulty of organization, cost of capitalization, instabilityof RRGs, and conflicts between current state laws and regulations and theLiability Risk Retention Act of 1986 (RRA), 15 U.S.C. 3901 <T3>et seq.</T3>The Agency recognizes that forming an RRG requires considerable effort.Evidence from the comments suggests that it would take at least one yearto establish a group. However, such groups are currently being organizedto offer environmental impairment liability insurance. One of these RRGsis now offering coverage to a number of UST owners and operators, includingowners of single outlets for retail motor fuel marketing.A number of commenters were concerned that costs of capitalization couldbe high for RRGs. The Agency recognizes that capitalization costs couldbe a significant barrier to RRG development. At present, however, thereis little evidence available to indicate what typical capitalization costsper owner or operator are likely to be. The recently formed RRG mentionedabove requires a capital contribution of $2,000 or an amount equivalentto the annual premium, whichever is less. Premiums are currently around$1,600 per site and are expected to increase to about $2,000.Broader questions of general RRG stability and solvency, along with issuesconcerning the regulation of RRGs by states, are questions connected withthe RRA and go beyond issues directly related to financial responsibilityfor underground storage tanks. Therefore, it is not within the scope ofthis rulemaking to address these broader RRG issues. Such issues, however,are being addressed by other agencies of the federal government. The CommerceDepartment has recently issued a report evaluating the effectiveness ofthe RRA.\6\<NOTE/> The report found no major problems with RRGs themselves (interms of solvency and potential risk to the public), but noted conflictsbetween state insurance laws and regulations and the provisions of theRRA. Such conflicts are matters for the states to address.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ U.S. Department of Commerce, <T3>Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986 Implementation Report, </T3>September1987.RRGs may be unavailable to some owners or operators due to an inabilityto organize into a group or raise the necessary capital. Regulation mayalso limit the formation of such groups in some states. While some USTowners and operators may be unable to form RRGs, however, the Agency believesthe groups may provide an alternative to insurance for a number of ownersand operators of USTs.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Specific Requirements for Insurance and Risk Retention Group Coverage</ITAG>A number of commenters questioned specific policy conditions that insurancemechanisms must include under this rule. In general, commenters questionedthe effect of these requirements on the availability of insurance. TheAgency recognizes that the limited availability of insurance, in part,reflects the significant uncertainties regarding the risk that insuranceproviders may be undertaking and that various policy language has beendeveloped to minimize uncertainty. Therefore, in specifying certain policyconditions the Agency attempted to meet two objectives: (1) The need toensure that insurance coverage will provide the same level of protectionas other mechanisms; and (2) the need to preserve flexibility in policyspecifications to allow insurers to develop acceptable policies and toavoid unnecessarily constructing the availability of insurance.a. <T3>On-Site Cleanup. </T3>Several commenters questioned the availabilityof insurance for on-site cleanup and suggested that financial responsibilityfor these costs not be required. The statute clearly requires financialassurance for corrective action. Corrective action involves cleanup ofcontamination caused by a release. While a release may, for an initialperiod of time, be confined to the property of an owner or operator ofan UST, there is no way to ensure, without corrective action, that therelease will not eventually affect the health or property of others. Financialresponsibility for corrective action will ensure that cleanup may be undertakenpromptly, thus minimizing third-party and environmental damage.The Agency recognizes that some insurers are reluctant to provide on-sitecoverage because of the ``moral hazard'' involved. In other words, insurersfear that coverage of on-site corrective action could provide a disincentiveto the owner or operator of an UST to maintain his site properly or mayencourage negligence and thus may result in more releases and more claimsto the insurance provider. Insurers also fear that coverage for on-sitecleanup might make them responsible for the costs of routine maintenanceor site restoration. First party coverage (i.e., coverage of damages tothe insured) has traditionally been offered as a separate type of coverage.Some insurers, however, provide on-site coverage in order to limit theirexposure to more expensive third-party claims. Currently, the two primarysources of insurance for petroleum USTs cover on-site cleanup of UST releases.A recent entrant into the market also provides on-site cleanup coverage.In addition, some other insurance providers will cover on-site cleanupif it will prevent more costly third-party damages. The comments suggestingthat on-site coverage is not generally available referred to policies coveringenvironmental impairment liability in general and do not reflect the standardpractice of the specialized market for UST coverage. The Agency receivedonly one comment regarding the recent entry into the UST market of an insurerwho will not cover on-site cleanup.One commenter suggested that coverage for cleanup be mandated whether ornot the corrective action is ordered by the government. Such a requirementcould be interpreted to mean that policies must cover response actionsthat the owner or operator might perform as a general operating practice.Although the Agency is requiring that on-site corrective action be coveredby all financial responsibility mechanisms, it does not intend to requirepolicies that make insurers responsible for activities that are clearlythe day-to-day responsibility of the owner or operator. Therefore, theAgency wishes to clarify that EPA is not mandating that acceptable insurancepolicies cover response actions that are part of routine maintenance ofthe tank site, site restoration and enhancement. Corrective action coveragewill be required only for cleanup of releases required by andSection;andSection;280.60 to 280.66 and 280.72 of the technical standards or ordered by theimplementing agency. The Agency believes that this requirement will ensurethat adequate financial resources are available to perform necessary correctiveaction.b. <T3>Non-Sudden Accidental Occurrences. </T3>Several commenters also suggestedthat insurance companies would not be willing to provide coverage for non-suddenoccurrences as required by today's proposal. The statute requires, however,that all releases, whether sudden or non-sudden, be covered. This is particularlynecessary to ensure adequate coverage for USTs, because it is often difficultto determine whether an UST release is sudden or gradual. Therefore, toensure adequate protection of human health and the environment, both typesof coverage are necessary. Comments indicate that coverage for non-suddenreleases is currently offered by the major providers. In the event thatan owner or operator could not obtain insurance for non-sudden releases,a separate mechanism could be used. Both mechanisms, however, must provide$1 million worth of coverage (see Section III.D.3).c. <T3>Agency Specification of Various Policy Terms. </T3>A number of commentersfrom the insurance industry felt that EPA-proposed coverage terms did notprecisely follow insurance industry standards and would limit availabilityof insurance coverage for USTs. However, it was also clear from industrycomments that adoption of the recommended language would not, by itself,increase the availability of pollution insurance. The objections of thecommenters centered on the definitions of the terms occurrence, accidentalrelease, and bodily injury; on the prohibition of certain exclusions (thosefor non-sudden releases and on-site coverage); and the requirement that120-day notice be given to an insured in the event of a cancellation. Thecommenters recommended that the Agency defer to standard industry practicein establishing policy language. One commenter suggested specific termsthat he felt would more strictly define appropriate insurance coverage.The Agency has two reasons for clearly delineating the terms of insurancepolicies that are acceptable to meet financial responsibility requirements.The first is that, given an insurance market with widely varying typesand scopes of coverage, the Agency is concerned that the insurance providedto an UST owner or operator in fact provides a sufficient level of financialassurance. Second, because the Agency has mandated that proof of financialresponsibility be demonstrated only in the event of a release or if specificallyrequested by the implementing agency, the Agency wants to define very clearlythe terms of acceptable coverage so that both the insurer and the owneror operator can determine whether the policy is adequate to comply withthe regulations.Several commenters took issue with the Agency's use of the terms ``occurrence''and ``accidental release,'' preferring instead the combined term ``pollutionincident,'' a term widely used in the insurance industry. Commenters alsosuggested that the term ``bodily injury'' be defined in a manner consistentwith the standard established in ISO's new CGL policy. These issues applyto all the instruments and have been addressed in Section III.C above.Commenters also requested that the 120-day notification period for cancellationof insurance be shortened. The Agency agrees that a shorter time periodwill still give owners and operators adequate time to locate another mechanismfor financial responsibility, and that the 120-day requirement may puttoo severe a burden on insurers by exposing them to the risk that the insuredwill fail to pay the premium in those 120 days. Thus, the 120-day notificationperiod may limit the availability of UST insurance. The Agency is thereforeshortening the notification period to 60 days (see also Section III.P belowregarding cancellation of mechanisms). The notification period for otherterminations of insurance policies has also been shortened to 60 days.Commenters made a number of very specific recommendations regarding theterms of insurance policies. Several commenters suggested that acceptablepolicies be required to include a provision specifying that the insurerpay on behalf of the insured, rather than reimburse the owner or operatorfor cleanup costs or third-party damage payments. The Agency has consideredthese comments and has determined that specification that insurance policiespay on behalf of rather than indemnify the insured is not necessary toensure that insurance will provide adequate assurance for corrective actionand third-party liability costs. Many policies currently in use alreadyspecify that the insurer will pay on behalf of the insured, especiallyin cases of third-party liability. In some cases of corrective action,the implementing agency may undertake response activities to clean up arelease in a timely manner. In such cases the implementing agency wouldreceive reimbursement by the insurer.One commenter recommended that lower premiums be mandated for tanks broughtinto compliance with tank performance standards in advance of their compliancedates. The Agency does not need to mandate particular premium levels becausethe market itself should respond to tank improvements by offering lowerpremiums for safer tanks.<T3>d. First Dollar Coverage.</T3> Many commenters felt that the provisionrequiring policies that make insurers liable for amounts within the deductibleapplicable to the insurance policy would be unfair to insurers, and ultimatelyforce them to bear the cost of the deductible. The Agency disagrees withthese comments. The Agency developed this requirement to ensure that disputes(between the insurer and the insured) over who is responsible for payingamounts within deductible limits will not interfere with prompt performanceof corrective action measures or with payment of third-party claims. TheAgency does not intend to require policies that limit the right of insurersto specify deductibles applicable to particular policies and to receivethese costs from insureds. Therefore, the first dollar coverage requirementshould not hinder development of a pollution liability insurance market.If an owner or operator is in bankruptcy at the time of a release and thereforecannot pay the deductible, the insurer, as a creditor, could seek paymentthrough the bankruptcy proceeding, just as any other creditor would.Commenters suggested that the LUST Trust Fund might be used to guaranteepayment of deductibles to the insurer. However, the statute establishingthe LUST Trust Fund specifically defines those cases in which the Fundwill pay corrective action costs and does not include payment of deductibleamounts. In addition, the Trust Fund cannot be used to pay third-partydamages.Pollution liability policies frequently have high deductibles in orderto keep premium costs down, and commenters suggested that paying amountswithin these deductibles may not be affordable by the insured. The firstdollar coverage requirement will prevent delay of cleanup or payment forthird-party damages in such cases and will meet the Agency's goals of protectinghuman health and the environment. The insurer will still be entitled torecover costs within deductible limits from policyholders, although insuch cases payment arrangements would have to be made.<T3>e. Policy Retroactive Dates and Exclusions for Pre-Existing Conditions.</T3>Several commenters expressed concern that the Agency's acceptanceof claims-made policies would limit protection of the insured and, consequently,the degree of financial assurance. Claims-made policies typically providecoverage only for releases reported during the policy period and that beginsubsequent to the policy's retroactive date. The retroactive date is generallythe same as the effective date of the policy.One commenter suggested requiring the retroactive date to be 18 monthsprior to the effective date of the policy. The Agency understands the concernof the commenters and realizes that use of claims-made policies could resultin occasional gaps in coverage, particularly with respect to releases occurringprior to the retroactive date. The Agency considered a requirement thatclaims-made policies have retroactive dates 6 months prior to the issuedate of the policy but decided against such a requirement because few,if any, insurers are willing to offer such a policy. Given that insuranceis likely to be the ``mechanism of choice'' of most UST owners and operators(especially smaller businesses), the Agency feels that its goals of protectinghuman health and the environment will not be served by specifying policyprovisions which will prevent most otherwise qualified UST owners and operatorsfrom being able to obtain insurance. Prohibiting the use of claims-madepolicies or requiring a retroactive date prior to the policy effectivedate is likely to severely limit insurance availability.In addition, the problem of gaps occurring in coverage prior to the retroactivedate is likely to be a significant problem primarily at the outset of theUST financial responsibility requirements, when large numbers of previouslyuninsured owners and operators purchase insurance for the first time. Afterthat initial time period, most owners or operators should be able to maintaincontinuous coverage, given the advance notice of cancellation that theAgency is requiring as well as the use of extended reporting periods forclaims-made contracts. Extended reporting periods allow the insured toreport a release occurring during the policy period after the terminationdate of the new policy. This ``tail'' coverage helps prevent gaps in coveragethat could arise because the replacement policy will not cover releasesthat occur prior to the retroactive date of the policy. In the case ofpolicy renewal as opposed to policy replacement, most policies should providecontinuous coverage over time because the retroactive date of the policyis generally the original issue date and not subsequent renewal dates.As the technical requirements for leak detection are phased in, ownersand operators are likely to identify a number of USTs that are leakingand are not covered by a financial assurance mechanism. When the ownersor operators of these tanks obtain insurance, these identified leaks arelikely to be excluded from coverage as ``pre-existing conditions.'' TheAgency realizes that insurance is not appropriate to meet the cost of knownreleases and is not requiring that insurance policies purchased to complywith today's rule cover known pre-existing conditions. Any requirementfor coverage of known conditions would be likely to severely limit USTinsurance availability because insurers will not be willing to issue policiesobligating payment for damages that have already occurred. UST owners andoperators are responsible for cleanup and third-party liability costs thatare not covered by financial assurance mechanisms. In some instances theLUST Trust Fund or state funding programs may be appropriate means to fundcleanup of those pre-existing conditions. (Under the LUST Trust Fund, however,owners and operators are liable for any funds expended to clean up pre-existingconditions.)An insurance representative expressed concern that implementation of thetechnical regulations would result in discovery of more releases in theearly years of the regulation and lead insurers to avoid the UST marketuntil compliance with the technical regulations is complete. While it islikely that more releases will be discovered in the early years of regulation,this fact alone should not reduce insurance availability. Insurers willestablish their own pre-conditions for tank coverage. Such pre-conditionsmay include inspections, audits or other measures to identify existingleaks. Tanks that are insurable are likely to remain so. Tanks that arediscovered to be leaking are likely to need corrective action and appropriaterepair, upgrading, or replacement before an insurer will accept them forcoverage. These measures will also be required by the technical standards.Phased implementation of the technical requirements should not adverselyaffect insurance availability, because insurers will be able to requirecorrection of existing releases as a condition for coverage.f. <T3>Endorsement and Certificate of Insurance. </T3>The Agency receiveda number of comments regarding the specific wording of the Endorsementand Certificate of Insurance required for users of insurance and RRG coverage.All commenters on this issue agreed that the requirement that tanks belisted by identification numbers on the certificate of insurance or endorsementwould result in more limited insurance coverage than the standard industrypractice of listing covered tanks by site. As described in Section III.E.5,the Agency agrees with these comments. For the purpose of determining theappropriate aggregate coverage, however, a statement indicating that themechanism assures 100 or fewer or more than 100 USTs is necessary. In today'srule, the endorsement and certificate language (andSection;andSection; 280.97(b)(1)and 280.97(b)(2)) has been amended to strike the requirement for tank serialnumbers and instead requires a listing of the number of tanks at each facilityinsured and the name and address of each facility.Commenters also suggested that the issue date of the policy is unnecessaryfor the endorsement and certificate of insurance, given that the policyeffective date, which defines the date on which coverage begins, is alsorequired. The Agency again agrees with the commenters that inclusion ofthe issue date is unnecessary and that the scope of coverage provided isclearer when the endorsement and certificate of insurance contain onlythe effective date of the policy. In policies without an effective date,the issue date is considered to be the same as the effective date. However,in cases in which policies include effective dates, coverage is generallyconsidered to begin on the effective date. In most cases, the issue dateand the effective date of the policy will be the same, but in those casesin which they are not, the difference could be a source of dispute concerningwhether a particular release is covered. Listing only the effective dateon the endorsement and certificate will eliminate such a dispute. Today'srule does not include the issue date of the policy in the endorsement orcertificate (andSection;andSection;280.97 (b)(1) and (b)(2)), but does continueto require listing of the policy effective date. g. <T3>Six Months Extended Reporting Period.</T3> As indicated in the April1987, proposal, the Agency is concerned that a claims-made contract mayleave gaps in coverage if, for example, a claim is reported after the expirationof a policy for a release that began prior to the expiration date. Suchclaims may not be covered by a replacement financial assurance mechanism(see retroactive date discussion, Section III.G.4.e above). Originally,the Agency proposed a one year ``extended discovery'' period to addressthis concern. Under this provision, claims made during the extended discoveryperiod for losses that occurred during the policy period would be covered.In today's rule, the Agency has changed the term to ``extended reportingperiod'' and reduced the time frame to six months. These changes were madefor several reasons. Commenters suggested replacing the term ``extended discovery period'' withthe term ``extended reporting period'' to clarify that the period onlycovers incidents which took place during the actual policy period and werereported during the extended reporting period. The Agency agrees with commentersthat the insurance industry suggestion more accurately describes the coveragethat the Agency intends. The Agency intends to require that only releasesbeginning during the policy period itself be covered during the extensionand agrees with commenters that the term ``extended discovery period''could cause confusion over whether a policy would cover occurrences beginningduring the extended discovery period or only those beginning under theactual policy period and reported during the discovery period. Therefore,the Agency has changed the term to ``extended reporting period.'' The Agencyalso agrees with the comment that it would be unnecessary to include anextended reporting period clause in an occurrence-based contract becauseby definition, such policies cover losses occurring during the policy periodregardless of when they are reported. Therefore paragraph 2(e) of the endorsementand certificate of insurance (andSection;andSection;280.97(b)(1) and 280.97(b)(2))are required only in the case of a claims-made contract. The Agency also reconsidered the proposed one-year time frame for extendedreporting. Several commenters addressed this issue. One suggested a reportingperiod of three years. Others urged that EPA should not establish a mandatorytime frame. While the Agency recognizes that a three-year reporting periodmay afford even greater assurance by allowing an owner or operator moretime in which to report damages caused by a release, the Agency has declinedto mandate such a lengthy reporting period. Insurers are unlikely to bewilling to offer ``tail'' coverage as long as three years due to the continuingrisk to which such coverage would expose them. Also, even if insurers werewilling to offer long reporting periods, the cost of the coverage couldbe prohibitively expensive. Because the Agency believes that an extendedreporting period is essential to ensure adequate coverage by claims-madepolicies, the Agency has decided not to mandate a reporting period of suchlength that the insurance would be unavailable or unaffordable to otherwisequalified UST owners and operators. The significant reduction in insurancecoverage created by such a provision would result in lesser protectionof human health and the environment. At the same time, the Agency does not believe that the length of the reportingperiod should be entirely discretionary. Therefore, the Agency has decidedto set a shorter minimum length of six months for the extended reportingperiod. The Agency has decided that six months is a reasonable time frame in whichto identify and report a release following termination of a policy forthe following reasons. First, implementation of leak detection requirementsshould result in prompt detection of releases. Six months should be sufficienttime to report releases occurring during the policy period. The Agencyis making such a reporting period mandatory for all claims-made contractsused to demonstrate compliance with today's rule, regardless of the reasonfor termination. Although the extended reporting period differs from theindustry standard, it is important to bridge the potential gap betweenthe end of a claims-made insurance policy and the initiation of anotherassurance mechanism. Second, commenters estimated that the cost of the extended reporting periodcould range from half the premium cost to more than the cost of a yearlypremium. This reflects the difficulty in establishing proof of when releasesreported during this extension actually occurred. The Agency feels thatthe cost of a six-month period would be affordable for more owners or operatorsthan the cost of a one-year period, thus increasing total insurance coverage.This is especially true because the owner or operator must also pay thecost of a new financial assurance mechanism to remain in compliance withthe rule. The change of the reporting period requirement from one year to six monthsmay help to address two other issues raised by commenters. The first issueraised by commenters concerned potential conflicts over responsibilityfor coverage during the reporting period. A release discovered during thereporting period could either be covered by the old insurance policy ifit began prior to policy termination or by the new replacement mechanismif it began later. There could be a delay in payment for corrective actionand third-party damages while the date of the release was determined. Asthe reporting period was extended the potential for conflict would increase.By reducing the reporting period to six months, the Agency intends to minimizethe potential for conflict between mechanisms and thus the potential fordelay in meeting the costs of a release. Second, members of the insurance industry noted that the extended reportingperiod required by the Agency differed from the reporting period in commonuse in the industry in that it was an ``upfront'' requirement, not an optionto be purchased only in the event that a policy was cancelled for reasonsother than non-payment of premium. Insurers feared that mandatory reportingperiods would expose them to the possibility of supplying coverage forone year to an insured who had not paid his premium, or who voluntarilycancelled, thus essentially receiving ``free'' coverage for one year. TheAgency wishes to stress that it is only requiring an extended <T3>reporting </T3>period during which insureds may report releases thatoccurred while their policy was in effect, not an extended <T3>coverage </T3>period during which insurers would be liable for releasesoccurring after the policy's termination. Insureds who voluntarily canceltheir policies, therefore, would not receive ``free'' coverage for anyperiod of time. Futhermore, by establishing an appropriate schedule ofpremium payment, insurers can best protect themselves against providing``free'' coverage to insureds whose policies they ultimately would canceldue to nonpayment of premium. One commenter recommended that forfeiture of insurance coverage due todelayed notice of a claim be prohibited. The Agency believes, however,that the extended reporting provisions of the rule adequately ensure thatclaims will be covered even if not reported immediately to the insurer.The reporting period would allow an insured covered by a claims-made policyextra time to report any releases which may have occurred during the policyperiod, but which were not immediately discovered. h. <T3>Legal Defense Costs. </T3>The Agency's proposal to exclude legal defensecosts from the coverage limits of insurance policies used to comply withfinancial responsibility requirements was opposed by many commenters. Thecommenters argued that insurers will not provide coverage exclusive oflegal defense costs. The Agency has reviewed these comments and decidedto continue to require exclusion of coverage for legal defense costs frominsurance policy indemnity limits. The exclusion was originally proposed for several reasons: (1) To ensurethat legal defense costs would not absorb too great a portion of coveragelimits and thus leave little coverage available for corrective action andthird-party liability; (2) to conform to the general insurance industrystandard practice for comprehensive general liability of paying all legaldefense costs outside policy limits until the indemnity limits have beenexhausted; and (3) to provide the same level of financial assurance tocover both third-party claims and corrective action as the other mechanisms(none of the other mechanisms for demonstrating financial responsibilityunder the rule covers legal defense costs). In general, the above reasons for the exclusion are still valid. Legaldefense costs could amount to a significant portion of policy limits nowand in the future. A study by the ISO indicates that legal defense costshave increased three times faster than indemnity losses since 1960.\7\<NOTE/> Defense costs per one dollar of loss tripled between 1956and 1984. This trend is not limited to any one particular area, but ratheris common throughout the general liability field. There are few actualdata on defense costs for liability suits brought in cases of pollutionreleases, but an Agency analysis of general liability, Superfund, and asbestosclaims suggests that legal defense costs in cases involving pollution liabilitycould constitute as much as 36 to 42 percent of policy liability limits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>The Rising Costs of General Liability Legal Defense, </T3>InsuranceServices Office, 1986.The insurance industry standard for commercial general liability coveragecontinues to be payment for all legal defense costs outside general liabilitypolicy limits until the limits have been exhausted by indemnity payments.Only about 25 percent of commercial general liability policies includepayment of legal defense costs within policy limits and ISO's standardCGL policy includes a clause obligating the insurer to provide paymentfor legal defense until coverage is exhausted by indemnity payments. EILpolicies are more likely than CGL policies to include legal defense costswithin policy limits; however, industry practice even within the smalleruniverse of EIL policies is not uniform. EIL policies are available thatprovide indemnity limits exclusive of legal defense costs.The Agency recognizes that the insurance industry attitude toward legaldefense costs may be changing. Some members of the industry, in responseto the spiralling costs of legal defense, have begun examining ways tocontain defense costs, feeling that the insurer's traditionally unlimited``duty to defend'' may be a disincentive to policyholders to keep legaldefense costs down. At the same time, it does not appear that the industryis moving toward inclusion of legal defense costs within policy limitsas a solution to the problem. While ISO proposed at one time that someportion of legal defense costs be included within policy limits, it withdrewthat proposal and has more recently put forward a plan to limit legal defensecosts outside of policy limits.Although the Agency's reasoning on costs of legal defense and standardinsurance practice continue in general to hold true, EPA recognizes thatlegal defense costs are sometimes handled differently in the specializedmarket of insurance USTs. The consensus of commenters is that insurancepolicies for USTs generally include legal defense costs within the policylimits. All policies issued through one major broker were written inclusiveof legal defense costs. A number of other insurance providers similarlyindicated that UST coverage would only be available if legal defense costswere included. One major insurer, however, has excluded, and will continueto exclude, legal defense costs for policy limits. Thus, while many currentUST policies include legal defense in policy limits, the Agency does notfeel that the exclusion or inclusion of legal defense costs will affectthe availability of insurance coverage over the long term.The Agency considered two other approaches to dealing with legal defensecosts. The first would be to allow insurers to include legal defense costswithin the limits. Because few UST insurers currently offer coverage exclusiveof defense costs, this option would at least reinforce currently availableinsurance policies as a means of compliance with financial responsibilityregulations. In addition, while it is clear that RRGs may cover legal defensecosts (section 3901(a)(2)(A) of the RRA explicitly legal defense costswithin the definition of allowable liability coverage), it is not clearthat RRGs will generate enough capital to cover legal defense costs aboveand beyond policy limits. Inclusion of defense costs in the limits couldfacilitate RRG formation. The second approach would be to allow insurersto include legal defense costs within policy limits higher than the $1million requirement. This approach would address insurer concerns regardingdefense cost limitation, but probably would not address issues of RRG capitalization.The Agency believes, however, that arguments for continued exclusion arecompelling and that development of higher insurance policy limits allowingdefense costs to be included would not guarantee that insurance would provideadequate financial assurance. The final rule continues to require thatpolicy limits be exclusive of legal defense costs. The statutory requirementis $1 million of per-occurrence coverage for the costs of corrective actionand third-party liability for USTs at facilities engaged in petroleum production,refining, or marketing. If insurance policy limits included defense costs,in effect, insurance policies would be providing financial assurance ata level lower than that required by the statute. Exclusion of legal defensecosts from policy limits is also consistent with RCRA Subtitle C liabilitycoverage regulations.The Agency recognizes that in many cases legal defense costs may not behigh enough to significantly affect the adequacy of insurance policiesto provide the coverage required, particularly that for corrective action.However, if defense costs for petroleum USTs are low, then the insuranceindustry will not be excessively burdened if it must cover these costsoutside of policy limits. Alternatively, if defense costs for petroleumUSTs are high, then coverage for these costs outside policy limits is necessaryto ensure adequate financial assurance for corrective action and third-partyliability costs. While this may place a greater burden on the insurer,the insurer is free, as many insurers are currently doing, to limit defensecosts in some way outside of policy limits.i. <T3>Insurer Qualifications. </T3>The April 1987, proposal required thatinsurers eligible to provide policies in compliance with UST financialresponsibility requirements be licensed to transact the business of insuranceor as an excess or surplus lines insurer in each State where a coveredUST is located. Commenters suggested that the proposed qualifications weretoo limiting and one commenter suggested substituting Department of Transportationregulations that allow insurers licensed or approved by a foreign governmentto provide coverage in addition to those licensed in any state or eligibleto provide coverage as an excess or surplus lines insurer.The Agency does not, however, feel that its qualifications for insurersare overly stringent. Foreign insurers offering coverage in the UnitedStates are generally licensed to provide coverage in at least one statewhich would, in most cases, qualify them to provide coverage as an excesslines insurer. Therefore, the EPA qualifications requirements should notnecessarily prevent UST owners or operators from purchasing insurance froma foreign insurer. The Agency does not, however, wish to allow UST ownersand operators to purchase insurance to meet financial responsibility requirementsfrom an insurer who may not be a stable source of coverage. An insurerwho is licensed only by a foreign government may not be subject to thesame reserve requirements that help to ensure that an insurer can meethis obligations. The Agency has, however, decided to make other changes to the qualificationsfor RRGs and insurers. Today's rule does not include separate qualificationfor RRGs and insurers as originally proposed, but instead imposes the samequalifications for both. Because a RRG is a type of insurer, it is simplerand more appropriate to delete the separate requirements for RRGs. TheAgency has also decided to delete from the insurer qualifications the requirementthat insurers be licensed or eligible in ``each state where a covered undergroundstorage tank is located.'' The final rule requires instead that insurersand RRGs be licensed to transact the business of insurance or eligibleas an excess or surplus lines insurer in ``one or more states.'' This changewas made because the Agency decided that the proposed requirements mighttoo severely limit insurance coverage available to owners and operatorswith USTs in more than one state. While the Agency continues to believethat it is essential that insurers and RRGs supplying financial assuranceunder today's rule be subject to adequate regulatory oversight, it believesthat a requirement that insurers be licensed or eligible in one or morestates will ensure that insurers and RRGs are sufficiently qualified toprovide UST coverage. This ensures that the insurance provider meets thequalifications of the state in which it is writing policies. If a providerwrites a policy for a large firm with USTs in more than one state, theprovider must meet the eligibility requirements in the state where thefirm buys the policy, but does not need to meet licensing requirementsin every state where an UST may be located. j. <T3>Other Comments.</T3> Commenters suggested specific changes regardingthe manner in which insurance policies are interpreted by the courts, specifically,questions of joint and several liability and use of retroactive damages.These comments go beyond the scope of this rulemaking and are appropriatelyleft to private insurance law. Note, however, that under RCRA section 9003(h)(6),liability is strict, joint and several for government costs incurred inresponding to a release of petroleum from an UST under section 9003(h).Commenters also suggested that the potential for direct action againsta provider of financial assurance would deter insurers from entering themarket. The statutory provisions of RCRA section 9003(d)(2), however, specificallyallow direct action against any provider of financial assurance. It is,therefore, beyond the authority of the Agency to prevent such direct action.Other commenters suggested that private insurers provide guidance to stateson the structure of state programs, that insurance be used to fill gapsin state fund coverage for third-party liability, and that EPA developoutreach programs and programs to encourage entry of private insurers intothe market. The Agency agrees that private insurers can provide guidanceon the structure of state funds and states may choose to consult with privateinsurers in the development of state funds. This rule allows several mechanismsand combinations of those mechanisms to achieve compliance. For example,traditional insurance may be used in combination with some other mechanism(like a state fund) to demonstrate financial responsibility. To encourage the entry of private insurance carriers, the Agency is currentlyworking with the insurance industry to develop a better understanding ofthe UST population and how UST insurance works. Several insurance companiescurrently provide UST coverage and there are indications that other insurersare planning to enter the market. In addition, the Agency believes thatthe implementation of the technical regulations will make UST risks morepredictable and thus make the market more attractive to insurers. I. Surety Bond (andSection;280.98) The final rule, like the proposed rule, allows owners or operators to usesurety bonds to satisfy their financial responsibility obligations. Section9003(d)(1) specifically lists surety bonds as mechanisms to be consideredin establishing financial responsibility requirements. Several commentersexpressed concern about the availability, terms, and costs of surety bonds.These commenters did not object to the use of surety bonds as a financialmechanism, but questioned whether owners or operators would be able toobtain surety bonds at a reasonable cost. They cited several factors affectingavailability. Some commenters felt that surety companies would be reluctantto provide coverage because they believe the implementing agency wouldhave absolute discretion over the control of the funds. For this reason,one commenter objected to the cancellation provision, which requires thesurety to fund a standby trust in the event the principal fails to obtainan alternative mechanism and the Director of the implementing agency knowsor suspects that a release has occurred. A large number of commenters statedgenerally that surety bonds will be unavailable for third-party liabilityand corrective action. Finally, some commenters stated that if surety bondsare available, only those companies able to meet the financial test couldafford the bond. Along these lines, one commenter explained that, in attemptingto meet the collateral requirements of a surety bond, petroleum marketerswould reduce or eliminate their financial ability to puchase their productsand equipment or to upgrade or monitor their equipment. The agency recognizes that certain terms of the proposed performance bond(e.g., the cancellation provision) may limit the availability of the bond.The Agency believes, however, that the terms of the surety bond as proposedare necessary to ensure that coverage is available when needed to takecorrective action and compensate third parties. For example, without thecancellation provision, sureties could cancel coverage when a release issuspected and the costs would be unfunded. The commenters who objected to the discretionary authority of the Directorof the implementing agency to control the funds appear to misunderstandthe proposed regulations. The performance bond clearly describes the situationsin which funds may be drawn; the Director does not have unlimited discretionto draw on the funds. (See also Section III.N of the preamble for discussionof the standby trust.) The Agency acknowledges that many companies will be unable to afford suretybonds, or meet collateral requirements. EPA has authorized the use of thosebonds in order to allow those persons who can secure surety bonds the optionof using them to comply with these requirements. The rule continues toallow use of a surety bond. In addition, as discussed in Section III.V.2. the Agency is incorporatingcertain exclusionary language into the terms of the instrument to moreclearly limit the type and circumstances of third-party liability for whichthis mechanism can be used. J. Letter of Credit (andSection;280.99) The final rule, like the proposed rule, allows owners or operators to useletters of credit to satisfy their financial responsibility obligations.Section 9003(d)(1) specifically lists letters of credit as a mechanismto be considered in establishing financial responsibility requirements.Many commenters on this mechanism did not object to the use of lettersof credit, but were concerned about whether this mechanism would be available.For example, many commenters believed that letters of credit are not viableoptions for smaller entities. Commenters pointed out that smaller companiescannot meet collateral or liquidity requirements necessary to obtain lettersof credit. Other commenters pointed out that the costs of letters of credit are muchhigher than the costs of insurance, and that tying up capital or collateralto purchase letters of credit would prevent owners or operators from usingletters of credit to purchase equipment for their businesses, includingmonitoring equipment and equipment for upgrading or replacing tanks. Onecommenter noted that the letter of credit would be unavailable to manygovernmental bodies because some lending institutions refuse to issue themto governmental bodies, and some city codes prevent governmental entitiesfrom securing letters of credit. The Agency acknowledges that the collateral requirements for letters ofcredit may approach or exceed the face value of the letter of credit, andwill be prohibitively expensive for many owners and operators. The Agencyis allowing the use of letters of credit, however, as an option for thoseowners and operators who can afford them. One commenter objected to the language in the letter of credit becausehe believed that it requires the issuer to examine the legitimacy of theconditions precedent to presentation of the sight draft. This commentersuggested that the sight draft and the statement that the Director of theimplementing agency must provide to the bank should identify the purposefor which the letter is being issued (corrective action and/or third-partyliability for sudden and/or non-sudden releases). This commenter also suggestedthat these documents should specify the tank identification number andname and address of each facility location. The letter of credit does not require the issuer to examine the legitimacyof the conditions precedent to presentation of the sight draft. The letterof credit is payable upon presentation of a sight draft and a signed statementcertifying that the letter is payable pursuant to these regulations. A number of commenters, in addressing specific mechanisms, disagreed withthe proposed requirement to identify individual tanks that are assuredby the mechanisms. They all felt that identification of the facilitiescovered by the mechanism would ensure that releases from the facilitiesare covered, without delays and needless paperwork to determine which tankwas the source of the release. The Agency agrees, and has revised the languageof the mechanisms to specify coverage by facility, rather than by individualtank. Individual tanks must be identified if separate mechanisms are beingused to cover different USTs. The letter of credit does allow the partiesto specify the purpose for which the letter is being issued (``correctiveaction'' and/or ``compensating third-parties for bodily injury and propertydamage''). In addition, as discussed in Section III.V.2., the Agency is incorporatingcertain exclusionary language into the terms of the instrument to moreclearly limit the type and circumstances of third-party liability for whichthis mechanism can be used. K. Use of State-Required Mechanisms (andSection; 280.100)EPA proposed that, in those states that have not obtained UST regulatoryprogram approval, UST owners and operators may use state-required financialassurance mechanisms to meet the federal financial responsibility requirements.However, the proposed rule required the EPA Regional Administrator to determinethat such mechanisms provide assurances that are at least equivalent tothose of mechanisms specified in the Federal requirements.Several commenters noted that allowing use of state-required mechanismswill do little to help UST owners or operators because not all states haveestablished or will establish their own financial responsibility requirements.Another commenter supported EPA's proposal that state-required mechanismsused to determine financial responsibility while EPA reviews the stateprogram will be considered to be at least equivalent to other requiredmechanisms and thus in compliance with Subpart I for the amount and typesof costs covered by the mechanisms.In response, the Agency agrees that some states without authorized USTprograms may not have state-implemented financial responsibility requirementsfor USTs. However, owners or operators in states that do not have authorizedprograms, but which do have financial responsibility requirements, willbe able to use equivalent state-required mechanisms. These owner or operatorswill not have to procure additional mechanisms to satisfy the Federal requirements.The final rule regarding the use of state-required mechanisms retains thelanguage in the proposed rule.L. State Fund or Other State Assurance (andSection; 280.101)EPA proposed that UST owners or operators may use state funds or otherstate assurance programs to meet the financial responsibility requirements.RCRA section 9004(c)(1) authorizes the use of ``corrective action and compensationprograms administered by state or local agencies'' as mechanisms to provideevidence of financial responsibility for state program approval.Although several commenters supported the use of state assurance programsas an acceptable financial assurance mechanism, commenters remarked thatstate assurance programs are generally not available and, even where available,often do not provide sufficient coverage. Several states remarked thatthey did not plan to establish funds or that the Federal government shouldnot rely on states to demonstrate financial responsibility for UST ownersand operators.The Agency recognizes that state assurance programs are not widely availableto date. However, funds have been established in several states, includingVirginia, Delaware, and Minnesota. Other states are also in the processof attempting to establish funds. The Agency does not require any stateto establish an assurance program.In addition, EPA is aware state assurance programs may not provide completefinancial responsibility for UST owners or operators. For example, fundsmay not cover third-party compensation or all corrective action costs.Therefore, UST owners and operators using these types of programs mustuse other financial assurance mechanisms in combination with a state fundto demonstrate compliance with the financial assurance requirements.Several commenters suggested that states use particular program structuresor particular financing mechanisms. For example, several commenters suggestedthat state funds cover corrective action costs above $100,000 and third-partycompensation costs above $300,000, up $1 million per occurrence. Othercommenters suggested that state funds be structured to encourage entryof private insurers into the UST insurance market.The Agency believes that the structure and means of financing programsis at the discretion of each state. EPA will not dictate the approach statesshould take in establishing assurance programs. However, for those statesinterested in establishing assurance programs, EPA will provide assistancein designing and evaluating such programs. In addition, EPA has developeda handbook providing guidance on establishing state assurance programs.The Agency also does not intend to mandate a particular program structurein states that currently use funds to cover UST release costs. For example,the Agency would not require a state with a fund that only covered correctiveaction costs to alter its fund structure (e.g., to add coverage for third-partycompensation) in order to qualify under this section. The owner or operatorwould have to obtain additional assurance to cover third-party liabilityrequirements.M. Trust Fund (andSection; 280.102)A trust fund was not included in the proposed rule as an allowable financialassurance mechanism. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, theAgency believed that a trust fund with a pay-in period would provide inadequatefinancial assurance early in the period, and a fully-funded trust fundwould be unaffordable to the owners or operators most likely to need touse the trust fund. Moreover, the Agency felt that a trust fund used incombination with an insurance policy would problably be more costly thanpaying the additional premium for first-dollar insurance coverage because:(1) Unlike the costs of other mechanisms, trust fund deposits are not businessexpenses for federal tax purposes; and (2) insurance policies for USTsmay be written to include coverage of a deductible that is later recoveredfrom the insured.The Agency received a comment requesting that a trust fund be allowed asa financial assurance mechanism. This commenter maintained that some firmsmay wish to use a trust fund to cover multiple tanks if other mechanismsare not available, and advocated allowing either a fully-funded trust fundor a partially-funded trust fund if combined with another mechanism thatprovides the remaining amount of required coverage.In light of this comment, the Agency decided to allow trust funds in thefinal rule. Although the Agency believes that trust funds will in generalcost more than other mechanisms and in many cases will be unaffordable,trust funds are allowed to provide more flexibility to owners or operatorsin providing financial assurance. To ensure that the trust fund will provideadequate financial assurance, the Agency requires the trust fund to befully-funded for the amount of required coverage, or partially-funded andused in combination with another allowable mechanism that provides theremaining amount of required coverage.The language of the trust fund instrument is identical to the languageof the standby trust fund used to manage funds paid from other mechanisms(e.g., letter of credit). The amount of the trust fund is determined bythe owner or operator, as long as the remaining amount of required coverageis provided by another mechanism.In addition, as discussed in Section III.V.2. of the preamble, the Agencyis incorporating certain exclusionary language, into the terms of the instrumentto more clearly limit the type and circumstances of third-party liabilityfor which this mechanism can be used.N. Standby Trust Fund (andSection;280.103) Under the proposed and final rule, EPA establishes the standby trust fundas the depository mechanism that an owner or operator must put in placeupon acquiring one of the following financial assurance instruments: Guarantee(andSection;280.96), surety bond (andSection;280.98), or letter of credit (andSection;280.99).Funds drawn under any of these instruments, pursuant to the instructionof the Director of the implementing agency, must be deposited directlyinto the standby trust fund by the institution making the payment. Theuse of a standby trust is necessary because without such a depository mechanism,any funds drawn under those instruments that are payable to the RegionalAdministrator would have to be paid into the U.S. Treasury and could notbe used specifically to pay for the UST corrective action or third-partyliability claims for which the funds were intended without Congressionalaction (see 31 U.S.C. 3302). Similarly, funds payable to the state Directormay have to be paid into the state treasury. The rule requires that the trustee must have the authority to act as atrustee and its trust operations must be regulated and examined by a federalor state agency. This trustee qualification requirement is the same asthe trustee qualification requirement under the Subtitle C regulations.If the trust operations are not regulated and examined by a federal agency,the trust operations must be regulated and examined by a state agency ineach state in which a standby trust fund is established. All commenters on the proposed standby trust requirement argued that theprovision is unnecessary. In the case where a guarantee is used to providefinancial assurance, several commenters asserted that the use of the guaranteeis comparable to self-insurance, which does not require a standby trustbecause, in each instance, funds are assured from existing corporate assets.The Agency recognizes that corporate assets are the source of the fundsfor both self-insurance and guarantees, but does not believe that the similarityobviates the need to establish the standby trust when a guarantee is usedto provide financial assurance. The standby trust fund is necessary to ensure access to funds when theyare required and to ensure that the implementing agency can address correctiveaction requirements promptly and preclude further damage to health or theenvironment. The financial test of self-insurance is a direct mechanism for providingfinanical assurance. When it is used, the owner or operator ensures thathe will take prompt, corrective action and pay valid third-party claimsfrom existing corporate assets_evidenced by satisfaction of the financialtest. A payment guarantee, such as the guarantee in the proposed rule and today'srule, is an indirect mechanism. When it is used, the guarantor does notensure that it will take prompt corrective action or pay third-party claimsif the owner or operator does not. Rather, the guarantor contracts withthe implementing agency that, if the owner or operator fails to undertakerequired activities, the guarantor will provide the necessary funds toundertake the activities from its corporate assets. EPA cannot hold thefunds directly because of the prohibitions of 31 U.S.C. 3302, as discussedabove. It is necessary, because of the prohibition, that the funds be placedin an existing depository mechanism, the standby trust, from which theimplementing agency can direct funding of required actions as promptlyas possible. Therefore the standby trust requirement for a guarantee remainsa provision of today's rule. Other commenters disagreed with the provision that the standby trust mustbe established at the same time as the financial assurance mechanism, notingthat, under RCRA Subtitle C, the trust is established only when assuredfunds are required. The commenters misstate the requirements of SubtitleC. The standby trust requirement in today's rule differs from the SubtitleC model because its purpose is different. In the Subtitle C rule, guaranteesare recognized to assure funds for closure and post-closure and third-partyliability. No standby trust is required for the guarantee for liabilitybecause valid third-party claims, if not paid by the owner or operator,are paid by the guarantor directly to the claimants. If an owner or operatorfails to perform closure or post-closure care whenever required to do so,the guarantor can perform the required activities itself or establish atrust from which EPA can fund the activities. Today's rule provides financialassurance for both corrective action and third-party liability. A releasefrom an UST may or may not occur. If a release does occur and correctiveaction is necessary, it should not be delayed while a standby trust isput in place. Prompt action will prevent further damage to human healthand the environment. In addition, because under Subtitle I one assurancemechanism covers both corrective action and third-party liability, thestandby trust provides a mechanism for the Director of the implementingagency to ensure that funds are available first to pay for corrective action(see Section III.S). The Agency, therefore, has not changed the requirementthat a standby trust be established when a guarantee, letter of credit,or surety bond is acquired to provide financial assurance in compliancewith this rule. The wording of the standby trust agreement must be identical to the wordingprovided by andSection;280.103(b). Uniform wording of the agreement minimizesthe administrative burden on the implementing agency by eliminating case-by-casereview of standby trust agreements and provides owners and operators withthe assurance that the agreements will satisfy the regulatory requirements.In addition, as discussed in Section III.V.2. of the preamble, the Agencyis incorporating certain exclusionary language into the terms of the instrumentto more clearly limit the use of the mechanism only to costs associatedwith releases from USTs. Commenters on the standby trust were also concerned about the costs oftrusts, particularly if the owner or operator has several facilities inseveral states for which standby trusts must be established and maintained.The Agency evaluated the costs related to establishing and maintaininga standby trust fund when today's rule was proposed. The primary costsare the costs of managing the funds; other relatively minor costs includethe administrative fee charged to establish the trust fund and fixed feesfor simply maintaining the account. The incremental costs of establishinga standby trust at the time the instrument is established will be minimal,since there will be no funds in the trust. The Agency believes, therefore,that the requirement to establish the standby trust fund at the time afinancial assurance instrument is acquired will not be particularly burdensometo UST owners or operators. In addition, the final rule allows the owner or operator to establish onetrust as the depository mechanism for all funds assured in compliance withthis rule. Owners and operators with a number of facilities in variousstates may, therefore, establish one standby trust into which funds canbe deposited if and when required. States authorized to implement thisprogram may adopt this policy or may require the owner or operator to establisha standby trust in their own jurisdictions. O. Substitution of Financial Assurance Mechanisms by an Owner or Operator(andSection; 280.104) Under andSection; 280.104 of the proposed and final rule, the Agency allowedan owner or operator to substitute alternate financial assurance, providedthat an effective financial assurance mechanism or combination of mechanismsthat satisfy the financial responsibility requirements existed at all times.After obtaining alternate financial assurance, an owner or operator maycancel a financial assurance mechanism by providing notice to the providerof financial assurance. The owner or operator must maintain continuouscoverage with a financial assurance mechanism to ensure the availabilityof funds at all times for corrective action and third-party liability claims,should a release occur from an UST containing petroleum. The Agency received no comments on provisions regarding the substitutionof financial assurance mechanisms by an owner or operator, and thus promulgatesthese provisions as proposed. P. Cancellation or Nonrenewal by a Provider of Financial Assurance (andSection;280.105) <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Length of Notice Period </ITAG>In the April 17, 1987, proposal, the Agency required insurers to provideowners or operators 120 days notice before cancelling (i.e., failing torenew) insurance coverage and 90 days before terminating a policy underother circumstances (e.g., non-payment of premium by an insured). Otherproviders of financial assurance were permitted to cancel, refuse to renew,or otherwise terminate an instrument only if the provider first notifiedthe owner or operator at least 120 days in advance. Further, EPA requiredany owner or operator failing to obtain an alternate mechanism within 60days after receiving a notice of cancellation or termination to notifythe implementing agency of such failure and submit evidence of the existingfinancial assurance mechanism, the name and address of the provider offinancial assurance, and the date of cancellation. In the sixty days remaininguntil termination of coverage, the implementing agency would then havethe opportunity to inspect the affected tanks to determine if any releaseshad occurred, thus assuring that the still viable mechanism could be drawnupon to provide any necessary funds. Moreover, the 120-day requirementreflected the Agency's concern that providers of financial assurance mightwant to cancel their mechanisms upon the discovery of an UST release, leavingthe owner or operator without assurance when it is most needed. Several commenters, primarily from the insurance industry, urged EPA toreduce the number of days' notice required for cancellation to 60 days.The commenters presented several arguments supporting their request. First,they argued that 60 days is an adequate amount of time for owners or operatorsto search for and obtain any other type of available assurance, or to determinethat none is available and report this to the implementing agency. Second,commenters noted that a 60-day notice period is becoming a standard insurancepractice in many states. Third, commenters viewed the 120-day provisionas punitive to insurers, and predicted that reducing the notice periodto 60 days would result in the greater availability of affordable coverage.Finally, two commenters warned that if 90 days or more notice were required,insurers would automatically send out cancellation notices on an annualbasis to every insured party, thereby giving them the time to review accountsat a point closer to the beginning of a new policy year. Based on these comments, the Agency has concluded that the 120-day noticeperiod is unnecessary for insurance, RRG coverage, and state fund coverage.In the 60 days following an owner's or operator's determination that noother financial assurance is available, the Director of the implementingagency has the authority to require a guarantor, surety, or issuer of aletter of credit to fund a standby trust. However, the Director of theimplementing agency does not have the authority to require insurers, RRGs,and state funds to fund a standby trust should a leak be suspected or confirmed.Consequently, an additional 60-day period following the determination byan owner or operator that no alternate financial assurance is availablewould not benefit an owner or operator using insurance, RRG coverage, orstate fund coverage in the manner intended by the Agency. Other circumstances unique to insurance, RRG coverage, and state fundsalso support the conclusion that a 120-day notice period for cancellationis inappropriate for these mechanisms. In cases where insurance or RRGcoverage is cancelled, for example, an owner or operator has an incentiveto submit any claims if there is a release. In addition, the extended reportingperiod for claims-made policies allows an owner or operator to file a claimsix months after the policy has been cancelled. Finally, states are notlikely to abruptly withdraw financial assurance in case of an UST leak.Consequently, EPA has decided that providers of insurance, RRG coverage,and state-backed coverage need only provide a 60-day notice period forcancellation or termination of coverage. Owners or operators who fail toobtain alternate coverage after these mechanisms are cancelled are stillrequired to notify the implementing agency 60 days after being notifiedof cancellation or termination of financial assurance (i.e., when coverageexpires). Reporting at this time can trigger an evaluation of the USTsfor releases which should be reported during the extended reporting period.Nevertheless, the Agency, for the reasons noted above, believes that theproposed 120-day period is essential in cases where an owner or operatorhas obtained a guarantee, letter of credit, or surety bond. Therefore,providers of these financial assurance mechanisms must still provide a120-day advance notice of cancellation or termination of coverage.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Termination for Non-Payment of Premium</ITAG>A number of commenters, primarily from the insurance industry, argued thatthe provisions should allow for a quick termination of coverage in theevent of non-payment of premium by an insured. Most suggested that thisperiod be 10 days. Under the proposed provisions, commenters noted thatthe insurance agent or insurer would have to provide 90 days worth of coverageon behalf of an insured who fails to pay his premium. Some commenters warnedthat should the 90-day period be maintained in all cases, they might protectthemselves from this contingency by requiring full payment of premium priorto the issuance of coverage. Moreover, commenters asserted that terminationwith 10 days notice for non-payment of premium conforms with standard industrypractice on other types of insurance.While sympathetic to industry concerns, EPA is unwilling to accept a 10-daynotice period in these cases. First, the Agency calculates that such abrief notice period will not allow UST owners or operators sufficient timeto obtain alternate assurance mechanisms, and hence will result in unacceptablegaps in coverage.Second, the Agency remains convinced that the shortened 60-day notice periodwill fulfill the needs of providers. As noted earlier, a 60-day noticeperiod is standard in many states. In addition, insurers, for example,could protect themselves by establishing an appropriate schedule of premiumpayment. Insurers could require payment 90 days before the expiration dateof coverage for the maintenance or renewal of the policy. An insurer couldthen terminate the policy with 60 days notice if an insured does not meetthe schedule of payment within 30 days of the premium due date.The Agency therefore is requiring a 60-day notice period for terminationof coverage even in the event of non-payment of premium by an insured.Q. Reporting by Owner or Operator (andSection; 280.106)The April 17, 1987, proposal required each UST owner or operator to keepevidence of financial responsibility at his UST site or at his place ofbusiness. (Section III.R of this preamble describes the nature of the recordsthat the owner or operator must maintain.) In addition, the proposed rulerequired an owner or operator to submit the appropriate documentation offinancial responsibility to the implementing agency in the following circumstances:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) When the owner or operator notifies the Regional Administratorof the existence of a new petroleum underground storage tank under andSection;280.22;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Within 30 days after the owner or operator has a known or suspectedrelease from a petroleum underground storage tank required to be reportedunder andSection; 280.74;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) If the owner or operator fails to obtain alternate coverage asrequired by this subpart within 30 days after the owner or operator receivesnotice of:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding underTitle 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a provider of financial assuranceas a debtor,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Suspension or revocation of the authority of a provider offinancial assurance to issue a financial assurance mechanism,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Failure of a guarantor to meet the requirements of the financialtest, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Other incapacity of a provider of financial assurance;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If an owner or operator is unable to obtain alternate assurancewithin 60 days after receiving a notice of termination of a mechanism,as required by andSection; 280.105(b); or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) If the owner or operator using the financial test fails to meetthe requirements of the test, as required by andSection; 280.94.</ITAG>The Agency received several comments supporting the proposed reportingrequirements. Two commenters, both representative of large segments ofthe regulated community, noted that an annual reporting requirement wouldimpose excessive administrative burdens on small businesses. Moreover,a number of state government commenters expressed concern that they mightbe unable to administer a mandatory reporting requirement. The commenterssupported their position by citing the large size of the regulated community,the lack of state financial and personnel resources, and the excessivepaperwork burdens that would accompany such an effort.Other commenters, however, urged EPA to mandate more extensive reportingrequirements. Two commenters suggested an annual demonstration of financialresponsibility. The commenters cited several benefits of enhanced requirements,including: (1) Greater incentives for proper tank management and rapidrelease detection and response; (2) the Agency's ability to target enforcementefforts towards owners or operators who fail to submit evidence; and (3)greater assurance that funds will be available to pay the costs of USTreleases.There are other potential advantages of more stringent reporting requirements.Stringent reporting could increase the level of compliance with the regulations,since owners or operators would be required to demonstrate on an annualbasis that they have obtained financial assurance required under this subpart.Despite these considerations, the Agency has decided that the advantagesof more frequent reporting are outweighed by several factors unique tothe UST financial responsibility program. First, the regulated UST community,consisting of an estimated 1.7 million USTs located at 500,000 facilities,is extremely large. Receiving and processing financial assurance certificationsfrom all these UST owners or operators on an annual basis could place substantialadministrative burdens on implementing agencies. In fact, the sheer volumeof reports could overwhelm implementing agencies and mask the more criticalinformation, i.e., cancellation or release notices. However, the Agencyintends to develop non-traditional approaches to compliance monitoringand enforcement and will initiate pilot projects in states to test theseapproaches.In addition, provisions in SARA for the LUST Trust Fund create incentivesfor owners and operators to comply with the regulations, since the fundmay be used to pay for costs in excess of the required amount of financialresponsibility if the owner or operator has maintained evidence of financialresponsibility. To increase awareness of and compliance with UST rules,EPA is preparing a public outreach program aimed at providing UST ownersand operators with information on all UST requirements. Moreover, manyUST owners and operators are already obtaining insurance to limit theirexposure to future liability due to UST costs.Finally, the alternative of reporting by postcard, while minimizing costsfor owners and operators, would still inundate implementing agencies withthe same number of reports, and thus would not alleviate the critical problemcreated by annual reporting.The Agency has thus decided not to impose more stringent reporting requirementson the regulated community.The Agency also received comments opposing certain provisions of the proposedreporting requirements. Several commenters disagreed with the requirementto submit financial responsibility documentation for new, and not old,tanks, arguing that new tanks are less likely to leak than older tanks.The Agency has retained this provision in the final rule. As noted above,the proposed requirement builds upon existing notification requirementsmandated under section 9002(a) of Subtititle I and codified in the USTtechnical standards (53 FR 37082, September 23, 1988). Specifically, andSection;280.22 requires owners or operators who bring a new tank into use to notifythe appropriate state or local agency or department of the existence, age,size, type, location, and uses of the new tanks as well as to obtain aninstallation certification. Including financial assurance information inthese reports involves a minimal increase in the cost of these reportsfor the regulated community and provides valuable compliance monitoringinformation to the implementing agency.Another commenter argued that owners or operators should not be requiredto submit financial assurance documentation for new tanks to both the EPARegions and the states. The Agency agrees with the commenter. While theproposed rule required owners or operators to submit this documentationto the Regional Administrator, today's rule relies on submittal of thenew tank notification to the appropriate state or local agency or department,as required in andSection; 280.22 and RCRA section 9002(a).Another commenter found the wording of andSection; 280.106(a)(2) unclear,and inquired whether financial responsibility documentation should be submittedfor a suspected release or only in the event of a confirmed release. Thefinancial assurance reporting requirements, which have been revised toreflect provisions for reporting releases for corrective action in andSection;andSection; 280.53 and 280.61 of the UST technical standards, now require submittalsin the event of the confirmed releases. (These provisions are discussedin further detail in Section IV.F of the UST technical standards preamble.)The same commenter urged EPA to allow entities installing large numbersof tanks the option of submitting financial responsibility documentationannually to the Regional Administrator rather than submitting multipledocumentation for each new tank. The Agency sees no reason to adopt thisapproach. Section 280.22 requires that owners or operators certify in thenew tank notification form that they are in compliance with the financialresponsibility provisions as well as provide information on compliancewith other technical requirements. R. Recordkeeping (andSection; 280.107)Under the proposed rule, owners or operators were required to maintainevidence of all financial assurance mechanisms used to demonstrate financialresponsibility under this subpart until one year after closure or one yearafter the completion of closure and corrective action. An owner or operatorwas required to maintain at his UST site or place of business the followingtypes of evidence for mechanisms used to demonstrate financial responsibility:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Copies of assurance mechanisms specified in andSection;andSection;280.94 through 280.100, worded as specified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Letters of certification from the chief financial officer of firmsusing the financial test of self-insurance or providing guarantees, basedon year-end financial statements for the last completed fiscal year. Suchevidence must be on file no later than 120 days after the close of eachfiscal year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Originally-signed duplicates of the standby trust funds wordedas specified in andSection; 280.103(b) for guarantees, surety bonds, or lettersof credit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Originally-signed duplicates of the insurance policies or RRGcoverage policies with the endorsements or certificates of insurance andany amendments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Copies of letters or certificates from states regarding coverageby state funds or other state assurances.</ITAG>The proposed rule also required the owner or operator to maintain a certificationthat the financial assurance mechanism used to demonstrate financial responsibilityis in compliance with the requirements of the rule.The Agency received a number of comments concerning the recordkeeping requirementsof owners or operators of petroleum USTs. Some commenters expressed unconditionalsupport for the provisions.Several commenters, however, were dissatisfied with the requirements. Onecommenter urged EPA to delete the recordkeeping requirements and insteadrequire owners or operators to submit evidence of financial responsibilitydirectly to the Agency. Since the Agency, as noted in Section III.Q, doesnot require the automatic submission of financial responsibility documentation,it has decided to retain the recordkeeping requirements under andSection;280.107.Another commenter suggested that the certification of compliance be keptat the UST site, rather than at the place of business, and that it includethe address of the corporate office where details would be maintained.The provisions of this section allow UST owners or operators to choosethis recordkeeping option. However, as with the technical standard rule,off-site records must be made available on request of the implementingagency.One commenter noted that compiling the annual letter from the chief financialofficer supporting the use of financial tests or guarantees is unnecessary.The commenter suggested that this annual letter should not be required,especially since the certification of financial responsibility presentsessentially the same information. Another commenter asserted that the certificationof financial responsibility is unnecessary.The Agency has decided to retain both requirements. Because EPA is notreceiving financial responsibility reports on a regular basis, the Agencybelieves that requiring an annual letter from the chief financial officermay be necessary to further ensure the validity of various financial responsibilitymechanisms. Moreover, the Agency notes that large firms, as a matter ofstandard business practice, routinely maintain the information requiredin the annual letter. Similarly, requiring the certification of financialresponsibility will provide additional incentives for owners or operatorsto comply with the regulations at all times, and will not entail a substantialadministrative burden.One commenter argued that sending the chief financial officer's annualletter to all UST sites will present significant administrative burdenson some firms. The Agency agrees, and notes that the commenter might havemisread the proposed rule, which allows owners or operators to maintainall documentation at either the UST site or the owner's or operator's placeof business. However, off-site records must be made available upon requestof the implementing agency.One commenter questioned the need to maintain an originally-signed duplicateof the standby trust agreement at each UST location or place of businesswhen it is adequate to maintain only a copy of the guarantee, surety bond,or letter of credit. Similarly, the commenter questioned the need to maintainan originally-signed duplicate of the insurance policy when it is adequateto maintain a copy of the certificate of insurance, especially since thecommenter's policy contains confidential information not intended for widespreaddistribution. Requiring originals, the commenter asserted, would increasethe paperwork burden exponentially for firms with large numbers of facilities.As an alternative, the commenter recommended that the Agency allow ownersor operators to keep copies at each location and be required to submitoriginals only in accordance with proposed (andSection; 280.106 or within15 days of a written request by the Agency.The Agency agrees with the commenter that requiring an originally-signedduplicate of the standby trust agreement and the insurance policy to bemaintained at each facility is unnecessary. An owner or operator need notmaintain an originally-signed duplicate of an insurance policy in orderto draw on the policy; similarly, an owner or operator need not presentan originally-signed copy of a standby trust in order to exercise the trust.Consequently, the Agency has revised the final rule to require an owneror operator using a guarantee, surety bond, or letter of credit to maintaina copy of the signed standby trust fund agreement and copies of any amendmentsto the agreement. In addition, an owner or operator using an insurancepolicy or RRG coverage is now required to maintain a copy of the signedinsurance policy or RRG coverage policy, with the endorsement or certificateof insurance and any amendments to the agreements.The Agency also received two comments suggesting that including a listof specific tanks and tank numbers in the financial assurance mechanismis unnecessary. The Agency agrees with these comments and has revised therequired wording of all mechanisms to reference each facility where coveredUSTs are located rather than a tank-specific list of USTs at each facility(see discussion under Section III.E of this preamble).Pursuant to the changes outlined in Section III.T, owners or operatorswill not be required to maintain evidence of financial responsibility forone year after closure. Rather, owners or operators need only maintainsuch evidence until the date of closure or until corrective action is completedif a release is found at the time of closure.S. Drawing on Financial Assurance Mechanisms (andSection; 280.108)The proposed rule provided special procedures for funding and drawing onthe trust fund and on the standby trust fund for those financial assurancemechanisms (guarantees, indemnity contracts, surety bonds, and lettersof credit) that require action by EPA to initiate payment. The rule proposedprocedures for EPA to follow in funding corrective action and paying validthird-party claims, while minimizing the administrative burdens on theAgency and owners, operators, and claimants.For corrective action claims, the proposed rule required that an owneror operator who notifies the Regional Administrator of a release in accordancewith proposed notification requirements (Subpart F of 40 CFR Part 280)must provide evidence of financial assurance within 30 days. Once EPA possessedthe evidence of the assurance mechanism, the Regional Administrator wouldbe able to prepare and submit the appropriate instructions to the providerof financial assurance to fund the standby trust, if necessary. If theowner or operator fails to conduct any necessary corrective action, theRegional Administrator can direct the provider to fund the standby trustand can direct payments from the fund.The proposal provided different procedures for third-party compensationclaims in andSection; 280.108(b)(2) than were established for correctiveaction claims, because the UST owner or operator may contest a third-partycompensation claim as invalid or inaccurate. In order to avoid EPA beingplaced in the role of a claims adjuster, the proposal required the owneror operator and the third-party claimant to submit a document signed byeach party and by attorneys representing each party certifying the validityand amount of the claims. If the parties cannot agree on the claims oramount underlying the signed certificate, a lawsuit may be required toadjudicate the validity of the claim and any amount due.In addition, andSection; 280.108(c) of the proposed rule established proceduresfor the Regional Administrator to draw on the financial assurance mechanismsonce estimates or known costs of corrective action and third-party claimsare available. The rule required the Regional Administrator to instructthe trustee to pay corrective action costs before paying third-party claimsin order to minimize further threats to human health and the environmentand additional third-party claims caused by the release.A number of commenters criticized the Regional Administrator's discretionaryauthority to fund the standby trust fund as too vague, especially in lightof the Regional Administrator's apparent lack of training in technicaland financial issues, his vulnerability as a political appointee to politicalpressures, and the lack of a mechanism by which a guarantor or indemnitorcan appeal the Administrator's decision to fund the amount awarded. Somecommenters thought that this loss of control over funds by financial institutionsor other entities will discourage participation by such entities in providingfinancial assurance.One commenter argued that providers of financial assurance will be reluctantto issue instruments if they believe they will have to process paperworkand follow the funding protocol even when their customers are financiallycapable of performing corrective action or paying third-party claims, orare able to obtain a substitute instrument. Apparently, providers of suretybonds and letters of credit carefully screen customers in order to minimizethe likelihood that the instrument will ever be drawn upon; that is, theseare truly intended to be ``standby'' instruments. As a solution, the commenterrecommended that the 120-day cancellation provision be shortened, and thatthe instrument be drawn on only if substitute coverage has not been providedfive working days before the instrument expires. This timeframe would lessenthe probability that unnecessary paperwork and processing would commenceand that cash would sit needlessly in trust funds requiring managementby the trustee.The essence of these comments is that the mechanism for funding the standbytrust will diminish the availability of the financial assurance vehiclesrequiring establishment of a standby trust. In responding to these comments,as well as those discussed below, it should be noted that the Agency'sdesire to encourage the availability of a wide array of financial assurancevehicles under this rule is secondary to the Agency's mandate to assurethat all financial vehicles will be readily available when a leaking USTis discovered. Thus, assuring the availability of funds for correctiveactions must take precedence over marginally enhancing the availabilityof any one mechanism.With respect to the commenters who thought that the Regional Administrator'srole in ordering the funding of the standby trust or the disbursement offunds would impair availability or, worse, compromise the integrity ofthe financial assurance program, these comments greatly overstate the discretionaccorded to the Director of the implementing agency (either the RegionalAdministrator or the state Agency director) under these regulations. TheDirector of the implementing agency is required to act only under clearlydefined circumstances, and, other than for cancellations, only when theowner or operator does not cover the costs of corrective action and third-partyliabilities. For example, the Director will require funding of and drawon the standby trust in three situations: (1) If the owner or operatorfails to establish alternative financial assurance within 60 days of noticeof cancellation, and the Director of the implementing agency determinesor suspects that a release has occurred and so notifies the owner or operator(evidence of a suspected release under andSection; 280.50 includes positivemonitoring results from testing, monitoring and sampling, unusual operatingconditions, or the discovery of regulated substances in the environment);(2) if the Director determines that there is a release and the owner oroperator fails to undertake necessary corrective action; or (3) if theDirector receives proper certification of a third-party liability claimor a valid final court order for a third-party liability claim that theowner or operator fails to pay (andSection; 280.108(a)(2) in the final rule).Thus, while the Director is a critical participant, the provider of financialassurance and the owner or operator are intimately involved in the actionstriggering funding of the trust, and ample notification accompanies eachstep.One commenter seemed to argue that availability does not hinge on the Director'srole so much as it is a function of the provider of assurance's aversionto risk and paperwork. According to this arugment, these mechanisms willbe available only to owners and operators who have the ability to undertakecorrective action and meet demands for third-party damages, but be jeopardizedif it is likely that the standby trust might be funded, necessitating costand paperwork. In response, EPA notes that payment into the standby trust fund is noteasily triggered, but occurs when cancellation of the financial assurancevehicle coincides with the likelihood of certainty of a release from anUST or when the owner or operator fails to carry out or pay for the actualcosts of corrective action or fails to pay valid third-party claims. Whenan instrument is cancelled and there is a known or suspected release, questionsof aversion to handling costs or red tape are clearly secondary to securingthe availability of funds for corrective action. The only other circumstancesunder which the standby trust would be drawn upon are consistent with thecommenter's concern; that is when the owner or operator truly fails tocover the assured costs. Further discussion of cancellation and noticeis provided in Section III.P, above. One commenter objected to the specific langauge in the proposed andSection;280.108(a)(1)(ii) that empowers the Regional Administrator to require fundingof the standby trust if the financial assurance mechanism is cancelledand not replaced and if the Regional Administrator ``determine or suspectsthat a release . . . has occurred,'' arguing that mere ``suspicion'' onthe part of the Regional Administrator was not adequate ground for fundingthe trust. The commenter would amend this language to prevent the RegionalAdministrator from acting unless a determination has been made that a releasehas actually occurred. The Agency cannot accept this restriction on the Director's authority toact on the suspicion that a release has occurred. EPA intends that thissuspicion be based on objective evidence, such as failure of a tank tightnesstest, discovery of free product in adjacent sewer and utility lines, noticeby the owner or operator, or other clear but unverified evidence. Further,the suspicion must be coupled with the cancellation and nonreplacementof the financial assurance mechanism as described above. In this case,there would be no new assurance mechanism to take over when the cancellationbecomes effective, leaving the owner or operator potentially unable tofund corrective action and third-party liabilities arising from releasethat occurred before the cancellation. Finally, a number of commenters misunderstood the workings of the provision.One commenter thought that EPA should not propose procedures to evaluatethird-party claims, but, rather, should allow the parties themselves orthe courts to settle claims. An insurance company association commentedthat the language suggested that the owner or operator may settle a claimwith a potential claimant without consultation with the insurer, thus placingthe insurer in the position of indemnifying any claim, no matter how frivolous,if the owner or operator chooses to settle. An insurance company commenterrequested that the standby trust provision be clarified to prevent itsapplication to insurance entirely. In response, the Agency notes that the claims for third-party damages aresettled by the parties themselves, with full access to the courts if unresolvedissues remain. The regulations simply provide a mechanism that expeditessettlement of claims made against the funds held in trust if the partiesagree on the details of the settlement. It is unlikely that insurance companieswill be providing surety bonds, guarantees, or letters of credit, but ifthey do, issues concerning any alleged breach of duty by parties to theagreement are the province of the legal system, not the Director. Finally,the regulations state clearly that the provisions of the standby trustdo not apply to insurance policies. After reviewing all of the comments on drawing on the financial assurancemechanisms, EPA has concluded that only two changes should be made to andSection;280.108 as proposed. All references to the Regional Administrator havebeen changed to the Director to clarify that these responsibilities aredelegated to the Director of the state implementing agency in authorizedstates. In addition, the standby trust is only required for guarantees,letters of credit, and surety bonds because indemnity contracts are notincluded as an allowable mechanism in the final rule. T. Release From the Requirements (andSection; 280.109)Under the proposed rule, owners and operators were released from the requirementsafter completion of closure or, if corrective action was required, afterthe tank was properly closed and after completion of corrective action.The preamble to the rule, however, discussed the Agency's intention torequire owners and operators to comply with the requirements for one yearafter closure. Many commenters objected to the possibility that ownersor operators who properly close their tanks would be subject to the requirementsfor one year after closure. These commenters pointed out that there isno need to require coverage after closure because corrective action, whenrequired, must be taken before closure, and because they believe that insurersare unlikely to insure owners and operators after tanks are closed.Commenters indicated that it is unlikely that financial assurance providerswill provide coverage after tank closure. The Agency recognizes that thisis the case. The closure requirements in Subpart G of the technical standardsspecify a closure process that requires owners and operators to notifythe Director of the implementing agency before closure, and conduct a siteassessment. If releases are identified, the owner or operator must conductcorrective action and the tanks cannot be closed until corrective actionis completed. This process will ensure that closure is not completed untilany releases from the petroleum UST system have been cleaned up.Therefore, the Agency has determined that the need for financial assurancewill be greatly diminished after corrective action and closure are completedand will not require owners and operators to maintain financial assuranceafter proper closure of their tanks. Under the final rule, owners and operatorsare released from the requirements after completion of closure or of correctiveaction and closure, when required.U. Bankruptcy or Other Incapacity of Owner or Operator or Provider of FinancialAssurance (andSection; 208.110)The proposed rule required that any owner or operator named as a debtorin voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings (under Title 11 of theU.S. Code) notify the Regional Administrator within 10 days after commencementof such proceeding. In addition, the proposed rule required a guarantoror indemnitor to notify the owner or operator by certified mail within10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding underTitle 11 (Bankruptcy) of the U.S. Code that names such guarantor or indemnitoras debtor. The proposed rule stipulated, furthermore, that any owner whodemonstrated financial responsibility using a mechanism other than thefinancial test of self-insurance will be deemed to be without the requiredfinancial assurance in the event of a bankruptcy or incapacity of its providerof financial assurance, or a suspension or revocation of the authorityof a provider to issue a guarantee, indemnity contract, surety bond, insurancepolicy, risk retention group coverage policy, letter of credit, or state-requiredmechanism. Finally, proposed andSection; 280.110 required states to notifythe Regional Administrator and owners and operators covered by a statefund or other state assurance within 30 days after the assurance mechanismbecomes incapable of covering assured costs. The proposed rule adoptedthe provision in Subtitle C rules for the incapacity of owners or operators,guarantors, or financial institutions (see andSection;andSection; 264.148 and265.148), but amended the language to make it more applicable to the requirementsfor Subtitle I financial responsibility.One commenter doubted whether an owner or operator would be informed within10 days after the commencement of bankruptcy of a provider of assuranceto notify EPA of the bankruptcy. The commenter suggested that this requirementbe eliminated.The commenter appears to have misread the rule. Proposed andSection; 280.110required a guarantor or indemnitor to notify the owner or operator by certifiedmail within 10 days after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcyproceeding naming the guarantor or indemnitor as a debtor. (As noted inSection III. G of today's preamble, indemnity contracts cannot be usedto satisfy the financial responsibility requirements.) An owner or operrator,in accordance with andSection; 280.106, must notify the Director of the implementingagency of the incapacity (e.g., bankruptcy) of a provider of financialassurance only if the owner or operator fails to obtain alternate assurancewithin 30 days of receiving notice of such incapacity.The Agency, therefore, has decided to promulgate these provisions as proposed.V. Provisions Pertaining to Other Instruments (andSection; 280.111)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Maintaining Other Instruments at Required Levels of Coverage</ITAG>If the Director of the implementing agency requires funding of the standbytrust where financial assurance is provided by a guarantee, letter of credit,or a surety bond, and draws on the standby trust or on a trust fund topay the cost of corrective action or third-party damages, the full amountof assurance required by andSection; 280.93 will no longer be available.The proposed regulations did not specify the steps the owner or operatorhad to take to assure that his financial responsibility obligations werebeing met after one of these mechanisms had been used. While the need totake these steps was implicit in the proposed rule, the Agency is makinga technical addition to the rule to clarify precisely how the mechanismswould be implemented. Accordingly, a new section has been added to thefinal financial responsibility regulation (andSection; 280.111) establishingrequirements for replenishing a guarantee, letter of credit, surety bond,or trust fund if the assurance these mechanisms provide falls below therequired amount.These new provisions provide that, if the amount in the standby trust isreduced below the full amount of assurance required, the owner or operatorshall:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) By the anniversary date of the financial mechanism from whichthe funds were drawn,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Replenish the value of financial assurance to equal the full amountof assurance required, <T3>or</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Acquire another financial assurance mechaism for the amount bywhich funds in the standby trust have been reduced.</ITAG>If a combination of mechanisms was used to provide the assurance fundswhich were drawn upon, replenishment shall occur by the earliest anniversarydate among the mechanisms. This new section provides needed instructionfor the Director of the implementing agency and the owner or operator,and, more importantly, ensures that an adequate level of funding will beavailable for corrective action and payment of third-party damage claims.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Exclusionary Language for Other Instruments</ITAG>The language of the instruments for guarantees, letters of credit, suretybonds and trust funds in today's rule contains a provision that they donot apply to certain categories of damages or obligations. These exclusionsare patterned on existing standard exclusions found in insurance coverage,and are intended to ensure that the coverage is not exhausted by the paymentof claims that are covered by other compensation systems or that are otherwisenot intended to be included within the scope of coverage. The five exclusionsdo not represent all common insurance policy exclusions, but were selectedbecause they were considered most relevant to the financial assurance mechanismsfor liability required under Subtitle I. In commenting on specific mechanisms,some commenters were concerned about the possible uses for the mechanismsor the Director's perceived discretion in ordering payments from the standbytrust. Incorporating this exclusionary language will ensure more certaintyfor the owner or operator and for the provider that these mechanisms willbe used only for costs associated with UST releases, as the rule requires.The exclusions, with one exception, parallel exclusions that are beingproposed for instruments under Subtitle C. The purpose of adding theseexclusions to Subtitle C instruments is similar to the purpose under SubtitleI, to ensure that coverage provided by the instruments will be availableonly to respond to corrective action and third-party claims related toreleases from underground storage tanks and will not be available to coverroutine accidents not related to USt releases or claims for damage to theowner or operator, or to meet other liabilities assumed by the owner oroperator which are unrelated to UST releases. The Subtitle C exclusion,however, excludes damage to the property of the owner or operator. Whilepermissible for Subtitle C liability requirements because only third-partydamages must be covered, such an exclusion would be inappropriate for SubtitleI because coverage for corrective action is explicitly required. Accordingly,EPA is providing a limited form of on-site exclusion which prevents useof funds to cover non-required corrective action (e.g., cleanup which wouldbe part of routine maintenance and not subject to Subpart F of the technicalstandards).<T3>Exclusion (a), </T3>for obligations under workers' compensation, disabilitybenefits, or unemployment compensation law or similar law, is intendedto prevent the use of Subtitle I financial assurance mechanisms to coversuch claims.<T3>Exclusion (b), </T3>for bodily injury to the employees of the owneror operator, is also intended to ensure that such claims are not coveredby assurance mechanisms obtained to comply with this rule.<T3>Exclusion (c), </T3>for bodily injury or property damage arising outof the ownership or use of any aircraft, motor vehicle, or watercraft,is to prevent use of an authorized financial assurance mechanism for routineaccidents that are not directly related to management of underground storagetanks.<T3>Exclusion (d), </T3>for property damage other than that related tocleanup as required by under Subpart F of the technical standards, is intendedto prevent use of the instruments' funds to meet other on-site cleanupcosts such as those for routine maintenance.<T3>Exclusion (e), </T3>for bodily injury or property damage for whichthe owner or operator is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumptionof liability in a contract or agreement, is intended to exclude liabilitiesassumed by contract that do not involve the ownership or operation of theunderground storage tank. It does not exclude settlements or other agreementsto pay damages in connection with accidental occurrences resulting in bodilyinjury or property damage caused by releases from underground storage tanks.W. Suspension of Enforcement (andSection; 280.112)  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Authority  </ITAG>RCRA section 9003(d)(5)(D) authorizes the Administrator to suspend enforcementof the financial responsibility requirements for particular classes orcategories of USTs. Suspensions of enforcement may allow time for ownersand operators of USTs in particular classes or categories or located inparticular states to obtain assurance for corrective action and third-partycompensation costs. Because some owners or operators of certain classesor categories of USTs may find that financial assurance mechanisms arenot generally available on the date set for compliance in the rule, suspensionswould allow these owners and operators time to comply with the requirementsthrough the formation of RRGs or the establishment of state funds.    The statute requires that, to suspend enforcement, the Administrator mustdetermine that (1) methods of financial responsibility are not generallyavailable for USTs in the class or category; and (2) either steps are beingtaken to establish a RRG for that class of tanks or a state is taking stepsto establish a corrective action and compensation fund under RCRA section9004(c)(1). A suspension of enforcement may not exceed 180 days. The Administratorhas the discretion to suspend enforcement for a period of less than 180days.    After an initial suspension expires, the Administrator may again suspendenforcement of financial responsibility requirements, but only if (1) methodsof financial responsibility are still not generally available, and (2)either (a) ``substantial progress'' has been made in establishing a RRG;or (b) the owners or operators of USTs belonging to the class or categorydemonstrate, and the Administrator finds, that the state is unable or unwillingto establish a fund <T3>and </T3>formation of a RRG is not possible.    EPS proposed relatively detailed procedures and criteria for its considerationof suspension applications. EPA requested comment on all aspects of theproposed suspension of enforcement procedures and on any alternative procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Suspension of Enforcement Process </ITAG>A number of commenters stated that the proposed requirements were unnecessarilycomplex and burdensome. They urged the Agency to simplify the proceduralrequirements associated with suspension of enforcement. (A detailed summaryof these comments is contained in the Response to Comments document, SectionII.T., in the docket.) Based on these comments and the enormous uncertaintyover the number of suspension applications the Agency will receive on thedates set for compliance, the Agency has decided to defer promulgationof the final procedures for suspension of enforcement. Therefore, thissection is not included in today's final rule; EPA intends to promulgatefinal suspension procedures as necessary in the future.  As noted earlier, the regulated community subject to these rules is extremelylarge. Due to current constraints in the insurance industry and the assurancerisks associated with the existing tank universe, there is also a correspondinglylarge universe of USTs for which financial assurance is currently available.However, EPA is today phasing in these requirements over two years andrecognizes that the availability of certain financial assuance mechanisms(particularly state funds) may change dramatically during that time. Moreover,some states may receive approval to operate their programs in lieu of theFederal UST program as the compliance dates arrive. As a result of thesefactors, there is significant uncertainty over whether, and to what extent,suspension of enforcement will be necessary in the future. Thus, it isimpossible for the Agency to craft appropriate procedures for implementingthe provision in a manner that is at the same time consistent with statutoryrequirements, responsive to the regulated community, and not an overwhelmingburden on the Agency.  During the phase-in period, the Agency will gain experience with implementationof the UST financial responsibility program and gather additional informationon the form that suspension of enforcement petitions should take. Thiswill serve as the basis for adopting procedures, if necessary, before thescheduled compliance dates for the largest group of UST owners and operators.Until such procedures are promulgated, however, the Agency does not intendto exercise its discretionary suspension authority.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Integration with Other EPA Programs  </ITAG>In promulgating the Subtitle I financial responsibility requirements, theAgency received a number of comments concerning integration of these requirementswith other EPA program, including other Subtitle I rulemakings and theLUST Trust Fund programs.  A. Other Subtitle I Rulemakings  The proposal noted that certain requirements in other Subtitle I rulemakingswere relevant to UST financial responsibility requirements. One set ofrelationships raised in the preamble was the influence of UST technicalstandards on the cost of corrective action and third third-party liability,and on the amounts of aggregate coverage needed. Early detection or reductionin the probability of release will reduce the occurrence and extent ofharm, thus influencing coverage. These relationships were the subject ofnumerous comments addressed in Section III.D of this preamble concerningaggregate levels of coverage.  Numerous comments raised other significant concerns about the relationshipbetween the technical and financial responsibility requirements. Commenterswere concerned about the impact providers of financial assurance wouldhave on tank upgrading and replacement vis-a-vis the proposed phasing ofrequirements in the technical standards rule. For example, several stateand local governments addressed the relationship between the content andtiming of the proposed technical UST requirements and the financial requirements,primarily the securing of insurance. They thought that insurance wouldbecome more readily available and less expensive if tank inspection andcertification were required first since insurance companies generally attachedthese conditions to coverage. However, they were surprised that the Agency'stimeframe for bringing tanks into compliance with new tank standards wasso long in view of the relationship between tank upgrading and inspectionand availability of insurance.  Some went further, stating that the insurance industry via the financialresponsibility requirements would be determining the technical tank standards,and that this incongruity was a major philosophical and logical flaw inthe regulations. Rather, technical considerations should drive the constructionand monitoring standards; then, with tougher tank standards, the financialresponsibility requirements cna be significantly curtailed. Furthermore,they argued that the heavy reliance placed by Congress and EPA on financialresponsibility was not consistent with the goal of Subtitle I to preventcontamination of ground water. Instead, consideration should be given toexpanding efforts in preventing contamination, which should be the objectiveof regulation, rather than environmental reclamation after the fact.  Commenters from the regulated community made approximately the same commentas the above, noting that meeting conditions imposed by insurers for tanktightness and leak detection will force tank owners and operators to meettechnical standards when the financial responsibility requirements becomeeffective, despite the later compliance schedules under the technical standards. Drawing a blunter economic relationship between the financial responsibilityand the technical requirements, these commenters stated that the moneyspent on insurance would be unavailable for tank upgrading where, theyreasoned, it would be better spent. One commenter concluded that a conservativeUST technical program and the state-of-the-art UST manufacturing and installationtechniques currently available will substantially reduce, if not eliminate,the need for excessive financial responsibility in most cases.  Commenters from states and the regulated community argued that the timingand content of the technical and financial responsibility regulations willresult in remediation, rather than prevention, being the dominant considerationbehind UST control, and in the providers of financial assurance specifyingthe technical requirements for tank owners and operators as a conditionfor coverage. The states and owners and operators apparently differ onhow each would correct this situation. The states would strengthen thetechnical requirements and reduce the financial responsibility requirements,whereas commenters from the regulated community would substitute state-of-the-arttechnical requirements for all financial assurance requirements.EPA does not believe either correction is necessary. EPA does not agreewith the assumption that the technical and financial responsibility rulesare necessarily competing alternatives, and in its final rules has attemptedto interrelate the two more clearly.Congress specified that financial responsibility under section 9003 (c)and (d) of RCRA could be required at the discretion of the Administrator.SARA amended these provisions to mandate financial responsibility coverageand to provide a response program for petroleum UST releases. Congressdid not present these amendments as alternatives to technical specificationsfor USTs. The sections of this comprehensive legislation cannot be viewedin isolation, but must be viewed as a whole; the overall goal of the legislationis to reduce the unacceptable risk to human health and the environmentposed by thousands of UST leaks through prevention and assuring quick responsewhen leaks occur.Both the technical and financial responsibility requirements are preventivein nature. Neither would be totally preventive of harm to the public healthand environment in itself, but in conjunction they will assure a high degreeof protection. The direct control of leakage from USTs is obviously a preventivestrategy, but is not foolproof. The funds assured through the various mechanismspermitted in this rulemaking establish a safety net that finances immediateand thorough corrective action when a release does occur and before thespread of contamination. If the provider of assurance also places demandson the owner or operator for technical controls, this strengthens protectionof public health and the environment by increasing the incentive for tankupgrading and replacement as well as assuring funds for corrective actionand third-party liability.Phasing in compliance for the financial responsibility requirements bringsthis compliance schedule more into balance with the compliance schedulefor the technical requirements. The Agency projects that many owners andoperators will begin to comply with the technical standards early in thephased-in schedule for tank testing and upgrading or replacement. Thesetanks will represent low-risk USTs and thus financial assurance, particularlyinsurance, should be available for them at a lower cost than for pre-regulationtanks.The Agency recognizes that there might be continuing concern because thetimeframes for the two regulations are not the same; however, EPA cannotwait until all technical requirements are in place before imposing thefinancial responsibility rules. The result of further delay would be anunduly long period of time during which many members of the regulated communitywould have no financial assurance and could be unable to afford the costof cleanup or liability. Moreover, longer delay would provide little incentiveto states and insurance providers to develop mechanisms that will be neededto comply with the rule.Several commenters claimed that the burden of complying with financialresponsibility requirements would force owners and operators to move tanksaboveground and, thus, that the final rules should contain criteria thathelp the changeover to aboveground systems. For example, commenters suggestedthat an owner or operator's commitment to move tanks aboveground over aspecified period of time should trigger an exemption from interim requirementsfor leak detection. Small businesses would be especially likely to installaboveground petroleum tanks in place of USTs. Because these tanks wouldpose significant hazards to facility personnel, local communities, andthe environment, the commenters went on to urge the Agency to assess theconsequences of this scenario before promulgating a final rule, and, meanwhile,to exempt small businesses not involved in petroleum marketing from financialresponsibility requirements.The Agency feels that moving tanks aboveground is not necessarily a problemif done in compliance with applicable state and local requirements. Anytank removed from underground to aboveground must meet the same closurerequirements under Subpart G as any other tank that is taken out of serviceor permanently closed. No reasons have been put forth by commenters forwhy financial assurance requirements should be waived for owners and operatorswho intend to withdraw tanks from coverage under these regulations in thefuture. In addition, because numerous jurisdictions already stringentlyregulate or prohibit aboveground tanks, the Agency suspects that movingtanks will not present as appealing an alternative to leaving the tanksunderground and providing mandated protection. Therefore, EPA has not providedan exemption from these requirements for tanks that may be moved aboveground.Finally, two suggestions were submitted that would relate technical andfinancial requirements. One commenter suggested that a financial creditshould be available to owners and operators who installed secondary containmentwith continuous interstitial monitoring, thereby minimizing the potentialfor leak occurrence and attendant cleanup costs and third-party damages.However, EPA has rejected the use of such credits, as discussed in SectionIII.D, above.The second mechanism consists of a new federal fund, financed by a salestax on petroleum products, to be collected and used by states as a statecleanup fund. One condition on the fund is that owners and operators wouldhave to register tanks with the state environmental department within 90days, with failure to comply triggering the need to supply proof of insuranceand/or net worth as prescribed in the proposed financial responsibilityregulations. However, the only available federal fund, the LUST Trust Fundunder section 9003(h), was created to provide cleanup of UST releases inparticular circumstances. Congress did not authorize its use as a financialassurance mechanism. Rather the fund is intended to ``stand behind'' theowner or operator who has obtained financial responsibility in the requiredamounts. SARA Conference Report H. Rep. 99-962, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. at271.B. Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund and Response ProgramBecause the LUST Trust Fund and the financial responsibility program areclosely related, the comments proposed a wide range of uses for the Fund.Several commenters stated that the final regulation should require statesto use the Trust Fund to cover costs in excess of financial responsibilitylimits where the owner or operator has complied with all regulatory andfinancial responsibility requirements. In support, the commenters citedthe Agency's discretion to forego full cost-recovery in section 9003(h)(6)(B)and the potential incentive this provision might give owners and operatorsto secure financial responsibility and report leaks promptly, as reasonswhy the final rules should specify such a condition on use of the TrustFund.Several additional uses of the Trust Fund were suggested. One commenterencouraged EPA to allow use of Trust Fund monies in cases where a leakoccurs at the site of an owner or operator who belongs to a class againstwhich enforcement has been suspended. Another commenter suggested thatthe Trust Fund could be used to repay RRGs for payments for deductibles.To offset these costs to the Fund, the RRG would require protection beyondthat required by the final regulations (e.g., secondary containment). Anothercommenter objected to the requirement that an insurance company must paythe deductible for a company in bankruptcy, because if the Trust Fund wereused for such purposes, the U.S. Government would be a preferred creditorin bankruptcy, whereas an insurance company making the payment would benon-preferred.A state commenter argued that Trust Fund money should not be given onlyto states with approved UST regulatory programs. The commenter stated thatthe Trust Fund and the regulatory program were created separately and shouldremain so; that the loss of Fund monies would place a major financial burdenon states with marginal capability to fund the base program; and, furthermore,that the environment and public health would be jeopardized by not usingthe Trust Fund separately from the regulatory program, as designed by Congress.Mayors could tap into the Fund if EPA would require, as part of state programapproval, that the state program provide direct municipal access to theTrust Fund for cleanup and oblige the state to address other local concerns.In addition, the commenter urged EPA to seek authority to use the Fundas a source of grants to develop local programs.With respect to the numerous and varied uses of the LUST Trust Fund offeredin the comments, as noted earlier, Congress has authorized use of the Fundto pay corrective action costs only under limited and specifically definedcircumstances. After final regulations on the technical standards and financialresponsibility go into effect, Fund monies can be used to pay for correctiveaction only in the following situations:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) An owner or operator who is required to undertake the correctiveaction and who is capable of carrying out corrective action properly doesnot exist or cannot be identified;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Prompt action by the Administrator (or state) is necessary toprotect human health and the environment;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The financial resources of the owner or operator, including anyUST financial assurance, are inadequate to pay the entire cost of the correctiveaction, and expenditures from the Fund are necessary to assure effectivecorrective action; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) An owner or operator has failed or refused to comply with an orderto perform corrective action.</ITAG>Section 9003(h)(11) explicitly prohibits the expenditure of Fund moniesfor corrective action at any facility where the owner or operator has failedto maintain evidence of financial responsibility in the required amounts,except (1) in cases where there is no solvent owner or operator, or (2)in cases where immediate action is necessary to respond to an imminentand substantial endangerment of human health or the environment, or (3)to undertake an ``allowable corrective action'' to protect human health.(Section 9003(h)(5) defines these allowable corrective actions to include``temporary or permanent relocation of residents and alternative watersupplies'' and exposure assessments undertaken to protect human health.)One result of these requirements is the preclusion of many of the alternativeuses for the Fund suggested by commenters. Specifically, EPA does not agreethat the state should be required to use the Trust Fund to cover costsin excess of the financial responsibility requirement. While the statuteclearly allows the state to use the Trust Fund in such a situation, thedecision should be made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of thestate. EPA also does not agree with commenters who suggested that the TrustFund be used to (1) repay RRGs for payments for deductibles, and (2) topay deductibles for companies in bankruptcy. Owners and operators are expectedto maintain evidence of financial responsibility and pay the costs of theirreleases. Congress intended the Trust Fund to stand behind an owner oroperator who obtained assurance to meet the financial responsibility requirementand, as indicated above, is to be used in instances where the cost of correctiveaction exceeds the level of financial responsibility required to be maintained.In response to the comment that Trust Fund money should not be given tostates that do not have approved UST regulatory programs, the Agency wantsto emphasize that the negotiation of state cooperative agreements for useof the LUST Trust Fund is proceeding on a path separate from the approvalof state programs. However, EPA has decided to make a link between theLUST Trust Fund and UST regulatory program to ensure that future contaminationis minimized. After the effective date of today's final rule, a state'ssuccess in making reasonable progress toward submitting a completed applicationfor state program approval may be grounds for increasing state access tothe Trust Fund in fiscal year 1990 and thereafter.In response to the commenters urging that the Trust Fund be made directlyavailable to local governments, EPA's cooperative agreement process involvesstates negotiating arrangements for proper use, recovery, and accountingof Trust Fund money with EPA. The municipalities are not parties to thesenegotiations and will need to rely on the state to implement a sound andeffective program for the use of the Trust Fund for corrective action.The statute does not provide for any direct EPA/municipality arrangement.Finally, as discussed in Section III.W of this preamble, the Agency hasdecided to defer promulgation of final procedures for suspension of enforcement.Until such procedures are promulgated, the Agency does not intend to exerciseits discretionary suspension of enforcement authority. At that time, theAgency will address the use of LUST Trust Fund monies to respond to releasesfrom tanks whose owner or operator is a member of a class which has beengranted a suspension of enforcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. State Program Approval</ITAG>A. BackgroundSection 9004 of RCRA allows any state to submit an underground storagetank regulatory program for review and approval by EPA. An EPA-approvedstate UST regulatory program will operate ``in lieu of'' the Federal program.The Agency may approve the state program if the state demonstrates thatits program (1) imposes requirements that are ``no less stringent'' thanthe Federal release detection, prevention, correction, and financial responsibilityrequirements, and (2) provides for adequate enforcement of compliance withsuch requirements.B. Financial Responsibility Objective (andSection; 281.37)In its final State Program Approval rule (53 FR 37212, September 23, 1988),EPA promulgated criteria for state program approval in the form of objectivesfor seven of the technical program elements in the final technical standardsrule (53 FR 37082, September 23, 1988): New UST system design, construction,installation and notification; upgrading existing UST systems; generaloperating requirements; release detection; release reporting and investigation;corrective action; and out-of-service and closed UST systems. The eighthobjective for financial responsibility of owners and operators of petroleumUST systems is promulgated in today's rule.These objectives represent the Agency's expectations of what constitutesa no-less-stringent state program. By requiring the state to achieve theobjectives underlying the detailed Federal requirements in each elementrather than match each regulatory detail of the Federal requirements, EPAprovides a performance-based measure for evaluating programs and recognizesthat the precise details in the Federal program are not the only feasibleapproach to UST regulation. By establishing these objectives, EPA alsoprovides a framework for approval that guarantees that each state UST programprovides a minimum level of protection.An important objective of the Federal program is that owners and operatorsof UST systems containing petroleum have adequate financial responsibilityto undertake corrective action and meet third-party liability claims. TheFederal law mandates $1 million per occurrence with appropriate aggregateamounts as the minimum level of assurance needed by most owners and operatorsof petroleum UST systems to meet cleanup and liability costs. Today's Federalfinancial responsibility rule allows an exception for certain classes ofowners and operators who store small quantities of petroleum for purposesother than selling it as a product. More specifically, owners and operatorsnot engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing and who havea throughput of 10,000 gallons or less per month are required to have only$500,000 per occurrence for corrective action and third-party liabilityclaims. In addition, the financial responsibility rule sets the aggregateamounts at $2 million for owners and operators with more than 100 UST systems,and $1 million for those who have 100 or fewer UST systems. Finally, thefinancial responsibility requirements will be phased-in over a 24-monthperiod from the date of promulgation for different groups of owners andoperators. In order to be no less stringent than the Federal requirementsfor financial responsibility for USTs containing petroleum, the state musthave requirements for owners and operators to have financial assuranceand for the types of mechanisms used to provide that financial assurance.The Agency received comments in support of the holistic approach to determiningno less stringent state programs, particularly because such an approachwould enable a state to trade-off more stringent technical requirementswith less stringent financial requirements, for example, lower amountsof financial responsibility. While the Agency understands that states mayexperience difficulty in obtaining statutory or regulatory authority torequire $1 million in coverage, that amount was established by Congressin Subtitle I and EPA believes it does not have the flexibility to lowerthat level of coverage as part of the Federal program or as part of stateprogram approval.The first aspect of this objective (andSection; 281.37(a)) concerns the amountof financial assurance, both per occurrence and in aggregate, that an owneror operator must have. First, the state must have a statute or regulationsthat require an owner or operator to have at least $1 million or $500,000per occurrence and $1 million or $2 million in aggregate, depending onthe size and type of the operation. This requirement follows directly fromthe Federal financial responsibility regulations for petroleum-containingUST systems.The Supplemental Notice published on December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48644) includedan objective for financial responsibility; however, aggregate levels werenot included in the proposed objective. To remain consistent with the Federalrequirements for financial responsibility, the Agency today is promulgatingthe final objective with a requirement that the owner or operator havefinancial assurance in appropriate aggregate levels. Addition of the aggregateis necessary to ensure that approved states require an adequate level ofcoverage. The aggregate level varies depending on the number of tanks ownedor operated. Owners and operators with 1 to 100 tanks must have an aggregatelevel of coverage of $1 million and those with more than 100 tanks musthave an aggregate level of coverage of $2 million. The final objectiveestablishes the same levels of coverage. Further discussion on pre-occurrenceand aggregate levels of coverage can be found in today's preamble at SectionIII.D.The second aspect of this objective (andSection; 281.37(b)) concerns thephase-in compliance schedule for owners and operators. The objective proposedon December 23, 1987 (52 FR 48644) did not include a provision for a phase-inschedule. This provision is being added to be consistent with decisionsmade following the Supplemental Notice to the proposed rule for financialresponsibility for petroleum USTs that was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 31, 1988 (53 FR 10401). In today's finalfinancial responsibility rule, EPA has decided to phase-in compliance over24 months from the date of promulgation at all UST systems following aschedule based on net worth and the number of tanks owned. Although EPArecommends that a similar approach be used by state programs, the Agencyhas decided to allow flexibility in the objective for states to use otherphase-in approaches provided that the schedule is completed in 24 months.Approaches that allow all of the regulated community to wait until theend of the 24-month period would not be accepted as an orderly schedule.The third aspect of this objective (andSection; 281.37(c)) concerns the varietyof financial mechanisms that may be used by owners and operators to demonstrateadequate financial responsibility. The Federal financial responsibilityrule allows a wide variety of mechanisms and combinations of mechanismsto be used. The state may also allow a variety of financial mechanismsto be used. To determine whether state-allowed or required mechanisms areno less stringent than the Federal requirement, general criteria have beenestablished that are applicable to all financial mechanisms. By establishingthese criteria in the Federal objective, the Agency believes that it isunnecessary for the state to have detailed requirements for each mechanismaffected by these criteria for purposes of state program approval. However,EPA encourages states to adopt the financial responsibility regulation,especially the language of each mechanism, since they have been developedand tested to ensure that adequate financial responsibility will be availablewhen necessary. For example, the state will not be expected to demonstratethat its regulations require a surety company to state in a bond that thebond cannot be cancelled during a 120-day period following notice of cancellationof the bond to the owner or operator. The state must, however, be ableto draw on the funds assured by the bond before cancellation occurs. Thestate regulations must ensure that the time period before the effectivecancellation of the bond provides ample opportunity for the state to assessthe facility, determine if a release has occurred, and, if needed, drawfunds from the instrument. In this way, the Federal objectives for financialresponsibility for UST systems containing petroleum are met.Section 9004(c)(1) of Subtitle I allows states to set up a fund that maybe used to meet the no less stringent requirement for financial responsibility.The state may choose to establish a state fund to provide financial assurancefor certain classes of owners and operators or for all owners and operators.The general criteria for state funds are represented in the objective (andSection;281.37(a) and (c)); these criteria are essentially the same as the requirementsfor state funds set out in the Federal financial responsibility rule inandSection; 280.100. Further discussion on state funds and their use in providingfinancial assurance will be available in guidance due to be issued thisfall by EPA. A briefer discussion can also be found in EPA's <T3>State Program Approval Handbook.</T3>Some commenters expressed concern that the requirement that states havea financial responsibility program that is no less stringent than the Federalprogram in order to receive state program approval will delay approvalof state programs. The commenters stated that complex financial responsibilityrequirements could discourage states from submitting UST programs for approval.They urged that EPA promulgate a simple financial responsibility frameworkand provide guidance to the states.As explained above, the requirement that an approved state program containfinancial responsibility requirements that are no less stringent than thoseunder the Federal program is required by RCRA Section 9004. However, EPAhas developed an approach to state program approval that provides statesas much latitude as possible consistent with the statute in adopting approachesto fulfill the requirement. The Agency recognizes the difficulties forstates in developing financial responsibility programs and is preparingdetailed guidance and outreach assistance to states to help them developtheir programs.A more complete analysis of issues regarding state program approval ispresented in the preamble to that rule (53 FR 37212, September 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement</ITAG>Although not raised as an issue in the proposal, implications of the proposedrules for compliance monitoring and enforcement activities received considerablecomment. Many of the comments were submitted by states.In general, the comments note that performing compliance monitoring andenforcement for financial responsibility rules will place a heavy resourceburden on the states. Moreover, some states are currently understaffedwhile others apparently have little experience with the options for demonstratingfinancial responsibility and would have difficulty evaluating them. Also,the proposed requirement for maintaining financial responsibility for oneyear after tank closure would be difficult to enforce, especially if thebusiness is sold, closes, or goes bankrupt.Some states noted that, if the states will be responsible for implementationof the financial responsibility program and will not be provided funding,then EPA should not have a strong oversight role or stringent requirementsfor state program approval. Another state commenter reads the proposedsection on reporting, which requires owners or operators to send evidenceof financial responsibility to the Regional Administrator, to mean thatEPA will administer the entire financial responsibility program.A number of non-governmental commenters also noted the enormous burdenthat ensuring compliance for such a large universe would entail, with someoffering approaches to enhance compliance and enforcement. One approachsuggested by several commenters is that EPA collect evidence of financialresponsibility from all owners or operators through periodic reporting;for example, using the Tank Notification Program to provide the basis forannual notification of compliance with financial responsibility requirements.Other commenters suggested that proof of financial responsibility be madea condition to obtain an annual operating permit. Another suggested thatenforcement would be enhanced if the scope of these complicated rules couldbe clarified using the following techniques: (1) Workshops, (2) fact sheets,(3) more detailed summaries, and (4) condensed versions of the regulations.Virtually all of the comments evidence both justifiable concern that performingcompliance monitoring and enforcement for such an enormous regulated communitypresents a formidable challenge and considerable confusion about EPA'sprogram for dealing with this challenge. The Agency believes that UST requirementscan best be implemented if the program is delegated to the states and localities.In a companion rule to the financial responsibility rules, EPA has setforth the requirements and approval procedures for state UST programs (53FR 37212, September 23, 1988). States with approved programs will haveprimary enforcement responsibility for their own UST programs. Under thisrule, EPA has provided states as much flexibility as possible to developtheir own approach to UST regulation and implementation consistent withstatutory requirements.Thus, in response to state concerns, the Agency will be allowing each stateseeking program approval considerable latitude in establishing the detailsof an enforcement program. Although Federal law mandates certain elementsof the financial responsibility requirements (e.g., the one million dollarminimum level of assurance), the Federal program not only allows a widevariety of mechanisms, but allows the states to develop their own financialmechanisms (e.g., state funds) to meet these requirements. In short, contraryto the concerns expressed in the comments, EPA intends that, over time,states will assume primary responsibility for the UST program and willalso have considerable ability to tailor their programs to each state'sexperiences and resources.States could adopt more stringent provisions, such as reporting requirements,than are established in the Federal requirements, or they could adopt anyof the mechanisms for assuring compliance that have been submitted in comments.Although EPA believes that the event-based reporting requirements finalizedtoday are sufficient to ensure compliance by the regulated community andto provide timely information to the implementing agency for compliancemonitoring, states can and, in many instances, have imposed annual notificationrequirements on owners or operators.In addition to assisting the states seeking approval with the developmentof their programs, EPA will be providing the regulated community with extensivecompliance outreach materials, which should include materials targetedto the needs of the large and diverse UST population. A secondary benefitof compliance outreach should be a higher degree of awareness of theseregulations and a greater level of voluntary compliance, thus easing theenforcement burden on the states.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Economic and Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Compliance with Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Sections 2 and 3 of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 131393, February 19, 1981)require that a regulatory agency determine whether a new regulation willbe ``major'' and, if so, that a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) be conducted.A major rule is defined as one that is likely to result in (1) an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, state, orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA has conducted an RIA of the Subtitle I financial responsibility requirementsfor petroleum-containing underground storage tanks. Based on this analysis,the Agency has concluded that this regulation may have annual costs ofgreater than $100 million. Therefore, the regulation promulgated todayis a major rule, as defined by E.O. 12291. The following six sections summarizethe results of the RIA: Section 2 describes the integration of the technicalstandards and financial responsibility RIAs; section 3 describes the regulatedcommunity affected by this regulation; section 4 presents some of the methodsand assumptions used to produce the financial responsibility RIA; section5 presents EPA's estimates of the present value of real resource costs;section 6 discusses the regulation's economic impacts; and section 7 describesits potential benefits.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Integration of the Financial Responsibility and Technical StandardsRegulatory Impact Analyses</ITAG>Under section 9003 of Subtitle I of RCRA, the Administrator of EPA is requiredto promulgate both technical and financial responsibility requirementsfor USTs. The RIA described here presents the costs, economic impacts,and benefits associated with the UST financial responsibility requirements.A separate RIA assesses the costs, economic impacts, and benefits of thetechnical standards (53 FR 37212, September 23, 1988).The results of the RIA for the financial responsibility regulation arepresented both in terms of the incremental costs and economic impacts ofthe financial responsibility requirements (the additional costs and impactsthat owners or operators complying with the technical standards will absorbto comply with the financial responsibility requirements) and in termsof the total costs and economic impacts associated with the impositionof the technical standards and the financial responsibility requirements.(The benefits of the technical standards and the financial responsibilityrequirements were not integrated because these two regulations have differenttypes of benefits that are not additive.)<T3>Methodology</T3>_There are two important differences between the regulatedcommunity for the technical standards rules and that for the financialresponsibility requirements. First, the technical standards apply to petroleum-containingand hazardous-substance-containing USTs. The financial responsibility requirementsonly apply to petroleum-containing USTs. Owners or operators of hazardous-substance-containingUSTs are not yet required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility.Second, all owners or operators of USTs falling within the scope of thetechnical standards rule will incur costs to comply with the technicalstandards. States and the Federal government, however, will not incur coststo comply with the financial responsibility requirements, because theyare not required to <T3>demonstrate</T3> evidence of financial responsibility for their USTs.Therefore, the regulatory impact analysis for the financial responsibilityrequirements applies to a smaller universe of USTs (approximately 1.5 million)than does the regulatory impact analysis for the technical standards (approximately1.7 million). The combined costs and economic impacts of both rules applyto the entire universe of 1.7 million USTs.The technical standards will require firms to improve their methods ofleak detection within 2 to 5 years after these rules are promulgated; inaddition, firms are allowed up to 10 years to replace or upgrade theirUST systems to meet UST system performance requirements. To comply withthe financial responsibility requirements, many firms will similarly haveto improve their methods of leak detection and replace or upgrade UST systemcomponents, although within a faster timeframe. This is because, to demonstrateevidence of financial responsibility, many firms that cannot self-insureand that do not currently have insurance will have to attempt to get insurancewithin two years of the financial responsibility rule's effective date.Insurers will generally require upgrading of UST systems as a prerequisiteto coverage.For the financial responsibility RIA, EPA assumed that insurers would requirethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Tanks be less than 15 years old or retrofitted to meet newtank performance standards; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Leak detection measures taken by tank owners or operatorsbe at least as stringent as those required by the technical standards.</ITAG>To avoid double-counting leak detection and tank upgrading costs, the combinedcosts of the technical standards and the financial responsibility requirementsare estimated by attributing to the financial responsibility requirementsthe <T3>difference</T3> between the present value of the costs of meeting insurers'criteria and the present value of the costs of meeting the technical standards.The only other cost elements added by the financial responsibility requirementsto the total costs of both rules are the costs of procuring and maintainingfinancial assurance mechanisms.The financial responsibility RIA compares the economic impacts of the technicalstandards alone to the combined economic impacts of the technical standardsand the financial responsibility requirements. While the combined impactsof both requirements are, in all cases, more severe than the impacts ofthe technical standards alone, in individual cases, the financial responsibilityrequirements actually help to mitigate the economic impacts of the technicalstandards. Quicker detection of UST releases and the availability of insuranceto pay UST corrective action costs will lessen, for some firms, the economicimpacts of having to comply with corrective action requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Regulated Community</ITAG>This regulation is estimated to apply to 1.5 million underground storagetanks (USTs) containing petroleum located at 468,000 separate facilities.For the purpose of this analysis, the regulated community was divided intofour major sectors: Retail motor fuel marketing, agriculture, local governmententities, and general industry. Retail motor fuel marketing is the largestsingle affected sector and includes 193,000 retail motor fuel outlets ownedby approximately 90,000 firms. This sector has been further subdividedinto three segments: Refiners, multi-outlet retail chains, and open dealers(defined as firms owning and operating a single retail motor fuel outlet).The agricultural sector includes all farms owning USTs with capacitiesof more than 1,100 gallons; approximately 46,000 USTs located at 30,500farms meet this definition. Local government entities own approximately62,000 USTs at 29,000 facilities. For the purposes of this analysis, thegeneral industry sector includes all other sectors (i.e., sectors otherthan retail motor fuel marketing, government, and agriculture) where USTsare located. Firms in the general industry sector range from large manufacturingconcerns to small retail operations. USTs in this sector usually are usedto provide motor fuel for fleets of vehicles (e.g., at trucking firms andautomobile rental agencies) or to provide convenient access to motor fuelfor off-the-road vehicles (e.g., construction equipment). The general industrysector is estimated to contain 642,000 USTs at 192,000 facilities ownedby approximately 137,000 firms.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Assumptions and Methodology Used in the RIA</ITAG>Following are the key assumptions used to estimate the costs and otherimpacts of this regulations:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The costs and economic impacts of the technical standardsare the baseline from which the costs and economic impacts of the financialresponsibility requirements will be measured.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Owners, rather than operators, satisfy and pay the costsof financial responsibility requirements, except when the owner is a privateindividual and the operator is a business corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; All owners who qualify for self-insurance use this mechanismto satisfy their financial responsibility requirements and incur real resourcecosts for developing and maintaining the required records and reports.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; All firms or local governments currently insured for correctiveaction and compensation of third-parties will maintain their insuranceto comply with this regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Firms or local governments that are not currently insuredand that cannot use the financial test of self-insurance will attempt toobtain insurance (rather than other financial assurance mechanisms) tocomply with this regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurance will only be available to firms or local governmentsmeeting insurers' criteria for insurability. The RIA presents regulatorycosts assuming that all firms and local governments that do not currentlyhave insurance or pass the financial test are able to get insurance bymeeting insurers' criteria for insurability (i.e., upgrading or replacingtanks greater than 15 years old and instituting suitable leak detectionmeasures). Using this assumption results in higher costs than assumingthat firms and local governments that do not currently have insurance ormeet the financial test cannot get insurance. Obtaining a suspension ofenforcement should be less expensive than meeting insurers' eligibilityrequirements within 2 years and paying insurance premiums thereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Insurance premium costs are estimated by assuming that premiumswill be double the expected value of corrective action and third-partyliability costs for the USTs covered. The expected value of costs of correctiveaction and third-party liability are based on the UST model developed forthe technical standards RIA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">5. Annual Real Resource Costs</ITAG>There are three main cost elements in the combined total costs of the financialresponsibility and technical standards requirements: Costs related to thetank replacement and upgrading and to leak detection; costs related toperforming corrective action; and the costs of procuring financial assurancemechanisms. The costs of procuring financial assurance mechanisms do notinclude the costs related to performing corrective action because thesecosts are accounted for separately. They also do not include the costsof satisfying third-party liability awards because such costs would beincurred even if the technical standards and the financial responsibilityrequirements were not promulgated. The cost of insurance, for example,does not include that portion of insurance premiums used to pay the costsof corrective action and third-party liability awards. It does includethe cost of insurers' profits, administraive costs, and sales costs.These costs (the <T3>real resource costs </T3>of insurance) are equal to approximately 40percent of the total insurance premium cost.The present value of the combined real resource costs of the technicalstandards and the financial responsibility requirements over 30 years is$70.28 billion. $38.83 billion of these costs represent the costs of tankreplacement, tank upgrading, and leak detection. $29.49 billion of thesecosts represent the costs of performing corrective action. $1.96 billionof these costs represent the real resource costs of financial assurancemechanisms. A portion of these costs (e.g., the costs of tank upgradingand replacement, and the costs of procuring insurance) would be incurredeven if the technical standards and financial responsibility requirementswere not promulgated. The present value of the total incremental costsof both rules (the costs of the technical standards and the financial responsibilityrequirements attributable to the promulgation of these rules) is $49.63billion. $18.50 billion of these costs are attributable to tank replacement,tank upgrading, and leak detection; $29.49 billion are attributable tocorrective action; and $1.64 billion are attributable to procuring financialassurance mechanisms.The incremental costs of complying with the financial responsibility requirementsrepresent a minor portion of the combined incremental costs of the technicalstandards and financial responsibility rules. The incremental costs ofthe financial responsibility requirements alone are $701 million. Theseincremental costs include $1.55 billion for accelerated tank replacement,tank upgrading, and leak detection (to meet insurers' criteria for insurance);$1.64 billion for financial assurance mechanisms (for firms that do notcurrently have them); and a $2.49 billion <T3>cost savings</T3> in the cost of corrective action. This savings resultsfrom the earlier application of improved leak detection, and earlier tankupgrading than would be required if only the technical standards were promulgated.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Economic Impacts</ITAG>The economic impacts of the regulations are assessed for all firms in theretail motor fuel marketing sector, except refiners, and for firms in thegeneral industry sector for which the expected annual insurance premiumcosts are more than 10 percent of the before-tax-profits.In the retail motor fuel marketing sector, economic impacts are measuredin terms of the percentage of existing outlets surviving 5, 10, and 15years after the imposition of regulations. Through year 5, 57 percent ofexisting small-firm-owned outlets would survive if only the technical requirementswere imposed. (Small firms are defined as firms with less than $4.6 millionin annual sales. This corresponds to the Small Business Administration'sdefinition of small firms in this sector.) Assuming the imposition of technicaland financial responsibility requirements, 55 percent of existing outletssurvive, if all small firms obtain insurance. By year 15, 34 percent ofoutlets would survive the imposition of technical requirements and 47 percentwould survive the imposition of both technical and financial responsibilityrequirements, if all small firms obtain insurance. Thus, by year 15, theimposition of the financial responsibility requirements has a beneficialimpact on the survival of small-firm-owners and operators.Small-firm-owned outlets that do not have existing releases and that canafford improved leak detection and tank upgrading or replacement costsare better able to survive with insurance than without it. Those small-firm-ownedoutlets with existing releases and outlets owned by financially-marginalsmall firms will exit the industy more quickly with the imposition of thefinancial responsibility requirements than with the imposition of the technicalstandards alone.The technical standards RIA does not account for the fact that many largefirms in the retail motor fuel marketing sector have insurance which canmitigate the economic impacts of having to perform corrective action. Itthus presents a worst case economic impact scenario. The technical standardsRIA estimates that 73 percent of existing retail motor fuel marketing outletsowned by large firms (other than refiners) would survive through year 5.The financial responsibility RIA, which accounts for the fact that manyof these firms have insurance, estimates that 83 percent of large-firm-ownedoutlets survive through year 5. By year 15, only 50 percent of large-firm-ownedoutlets would survive the imposition of the technical standards if theydid not have insurance. When insurance is considered, 78 percent of large-firm-ownedoutlets survive through year 15.In the general industry sector, EPA examined financial data for firms in65 four-digit SIC code categories that contain firms that own USTs. Inonly 4 of these SIC code categories would the value of premiums exceed10 percent of the before-tax profits of average firms in those categorieshaving less than $1 million in assets, and the impact of these premiumcosts on the pre-tax returns on assets for these firms ranged between 0.1and 0.9 percent. Most firms in these SIC code categories do not use USTs,and it is impossible that, if the costs of today's regulation imposed severeimpacts on those firms in those sectors that do use them, they could avoidthese costs by closing their UST facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Benefits</ITAG>Today's rule is associated with a variety of potential economic benefitsthat are discussed in qualitative terms in the RIA. Potential economicbenefits from the financial responsibility requirements can be placed inthree categories:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Resource allocation;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Willingness to pay for distributional goals; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Reductions in cleanup costs, environmental and health damage,UST releases, and business disruptions.</ITAG>If the financial responsibility requirements induce firms to consider thefull costs of UST releases as part of their real production costs (i.e.,cost internalization), the result may be an improvement in the allocativeefficiency of UST users. Since allocative efficiency improvements resultin improvements for the population in the aggregate, the population canbe expected to be willing to pay for this improvement. Similarly, the populationalso could be willing to pay for progress toward distributional goals (i.e.,be willing to incur some cost to ensure that the UST owners and operatorsand the consumers of goods whose production involves the use of USTs andwho benefit from the use of the USTs also bear the costs of that activity).Small firms that use insurance to meet their financial responsibility requirementsmay be more inclined to report releases from their USTs promptly, whereasfirms without insurance may be reluctant to report releases out of a fearthat the costs associated with the release could force the firms out ofbusiness. In addition, firms having to obtain insurance will have to meetinsurers' eligibility requirements (e.g., improved leak detection and tankupgrading), thus reducing the likelihood of releases.As reported above, meeting insurers' eligibility criteria is estimatedto save $2.49 billion in corrective action costs over 30 years. Over thelong term, the imposition of the financial responsibility requirementsalso reduces the economic disruptions caused by the bankruptcy of firmsunable to meet the costs of performing corrective action or satisfyingthird-party liability awards. After 15 years, the number of surviving outletsis 14 percentage points higher if financial responsibility requirementsare imposed.The RIA also estimates the quantitative benefits of the financial responsibilityrule. It provides a comparison of the value of unfunded financial responsibilityobligations that would occur if the technical standards alone were implemented,to the value of unfunded financial responsibility obligations if all businessesin the retail motor fuel marketing sector meet financial responsibilityrequirements using insurance or the financial test. In making this comparison,the RIA finds that the promulgation of the financial responsibility, inaddition to the technical, standards saves $391 million, or $494 per UST,over a 30-year period.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>), whenever an agency is required to publish a generalnotice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare andmake available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis thatdescribes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses,small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatoryflexibility analysis is required, however, if the head of the agency certifiesthat the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. EPA has conducted an analysis of the impacts of this regulation on smallbusinesses as part of its regulatory impact analysis (RIA) and has concludedthat this regulation may have a significant economic impact on some smallbusinesses. EPA examined the economic impacts of financial responsibilityrequirements on the small business segments of the retail motor fuel marketingindustry and on the general industry sectors for which expected annualinsurance premium costs are more than 10 percent of before-tax profits.In the retail motor fuel marketing sector, economic impacts are measuredin terms of the percentage of existing outlets surviving 5, 10, and 15years after the imposition of regulations. Through year 5, 57 percent ofexisting small-firm-owned outlets would survive if only the technical requirementswere imposed. Assuming the imposition of technical and financial responsibilityrequirements, 55 percent of existing outlets survive, if all small firmscan obtain insurance. By year 15, 34 percent of outlets would survive theimposition of technical requirements and 47 percent would survive the impositionof both technical and financial responsibility requirements, if all smallfirms can obtain insurance. Thus, by year 15, the imposition of the financialresponsibility requirements has a beneficial impact on the survival ofsmall-firm-owned outlets. In the general industry sector, EPA found that the costs of insurance premiumsrepresent 10 percent or more of the before-tax profits of firms that haveless than $1 million in assets in 4 of the 65 four-digit SIC codes examined.The impact of these premium costs on the pre-tax returns on assets forthese firms ranged between 0.1 and 0.9 percent. The RIA does not examine the possibility that all corrective action costsand third-party liability awards might be paid by state funds financedby taxes on gasoline. Such funds would minimize economic impacts on smallbusinesses and transfer the costs of these financial responsibility requirementsto the consumers of motor fuel. C.
