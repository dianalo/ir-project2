ATandamp;T's move could eliminate as many as one-third of its18,000 operators over the next two years. The company said itwill cut 200 to 400 managers and 3,000 to 6,000 operatorsfrom its operator services organization by the end of 1994through dismissals, attrition and transfers.</LP><TEXT>   They'll be replaced by a computerized &quot;voice-recognition&quot;technology pioneered by ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories that respondsto a caller's verbal prompts, ATandamp;T said. Instead of talkingto a human operator, callers on the ATandamp;T network will tell arobotic operator the type of call they would like to make.   &quot;The voice prompts the caller to say `collect; thirdnumber; person-to-person; or calling card,'&quot; said an ATandamp;Tspokesman about the company's newest service breakthrough.When the call is made, he said, &quot;the system will tell thecalled party, `I have a collect call from Mr. So and So. Doyou accept the call?'&quot; The spokesman added that a customerwill always be able to get a live operator simply by saying&quot;operator,&quot; and that if the system doesn't understand thecustomer, it will automatically switch to an operator.   ATandamp;T's move prompted an angry response from its largestunion, the Communications Workers of America. ATandamp;T and theCWA have been at odds over continual massive cutbacks thathave trimmed ATandamp;T's ranks by 100,000 workers since itsbreakup in 1984. But lately their relations have becomeincreasingly strained as the union pegged recent problemswith ATandamp;T service, including four major network failures intwo years, to overzealous cost-cutting by thetelecommunications giant.   &quot;We're outraged by ATandamp;T's move . . . and by theirunbelievable disrespect of our union,&quot; said CWA PresidentMorton Bahr. &quot;ATandamp;T's decision to announce layoffs . . . fourweeks before contract talks begin is the worst intimidationtactic we have ever seen.&quot; Added J.D. Williams, president ofa CWA local representing ATandamp;T operators in Dallas: &quot;It's asad day in the history of ATandamp;T and the Bell System, whichhave been offering operator services for more than 100years.&quot; ATandamp;T plans to close the Dallas center, which employs140 operators.   But ATandamp;T's spokesman said the company's statistics showthat fewer Americans are using live operators these days tohelp place their calls. &quot;Ninety percent of all long-distancecalls are made without an operator and the number ofoperator-assisted calls has been declining by 8% a year,&quot;said ATandamp;T's spokesman. This is a trend, he added, that goesback to 1951 when ATandamp;T introduced direct-dialed long-distancecalling. &quot;{Voice recognition} is one more step on thattechnology path,&quot; he said.   ATandamp;T decided to deploy the system after conducting twofield tests in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The company saidthe trials indicated that customers found the system easy touse and more versatile from a service standpoint. The systemuses a method called &quot;word spotting&quot; to filter outautomatically any spoken words it doesn't need to act upon,ATandamp;T said.   ATandamp;T said workers who will potentially be affected by thechange will be able to apply for as many as eight types ofalternative jobs, including international operator servicesand positions at bilingual operator centers. In addition,those who leave will get severance benefits of up to 104weeks pay for the most senior people.</TEXT></DOC>
