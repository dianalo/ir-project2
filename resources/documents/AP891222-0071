The vote after a marathon emergency session of the Organizationof American States also called for the withdrawal of troops used inthe U.S. action, but it did not condemn the intervention outrightand sought no timetable for the American troops to leave.   A resolution by Nicaragua to condemn the use of force to oustPanamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power was not formallyconsidered.   John Maisto, the U.S. deputy permanent representative to theOAS, called the final resolution ``a mixed bag. ... We're a littledisappointed. It certainly wasn't an extreme resolution, but it's alittle detached from what is really happening in Panama.''   The OAS political council voted 20-1 with six abstentions ``todeeply regret the military intervention in Panama.''   The Spanish-language version of the resolution distributed afterthe vote used the words ``deplorar profundamente,'' whichtranslates more closely to ``deeply deplore.'' But James Todd, aspokesman for the U.S. delegation, said the stronger Spanishlanguage was a mistranslation of a resolution drafted in Englishand he expected a clarification later in the day.   ``The English version was circulated and voted on. We're usingthe English,'' said Todd.   The resolution noted ``the serious events (in Panama),especially the armed clashes resulting from the militaryintervention by the United States and the deplorable loss of livesand property.''   U.S. Ambassador Luigi Enaudi cast the only negative vote on themotion engineered by Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay andArgentina.   The resolution urged ``the immediate cessation of hostilitiesand bloodshed (in Panama) and the launching of negotiations betweenthe various political sectors of that country that will lead to aconcerted solution of the Panamanian institutional crisis.''   ``There was not a condemnation,'' said Maisto. ``It was just anexpression of the need for withdrawal (of troops), which is notunlike what President Bush has called for _ when the job iscompleted.''   A U.S. attempt to term the invasion a ``military action'' failedwith only three votes among the 26 delegates who attended the17-hour debate and negotiation. Only Honduras and Costa Ricasupported the United States.   Another amendment by Costa Rica and Guatemala to blame Noriegafor the ``chaos and anarchy'' that prompted the U.S. move was alsodefected by a 7-2 vote with 12 abstentions.   Venezuela was the only leading Latin democracy to abstain fromthe final vote. Venezuela has urged the OAS to express some form ofrecognition to the U.S.-installed government of President GuillermoEndara.   The OAS said it ``reaffirmed that solving the crisis Panama isundergoing at this time necessarily requires the full respect forthe right of the Panamanian people to self-determination withoutoutside interference and faithful adherence to the letter andspirit of the treaties'' under which the United States is to turnthe Panama Canal over to Panama in 2000.   The security of the canal is one of the reasons cited by theBush administration for launching the invasion.   Enaudi also failed by an 11-4 vote with two abstentions in anattempt to add to the resolution a mention that the OAS charteritself allows each nation the right of self-defense.   Enaudi said that once Noriega declared a state of war againstthe United States, the U.S. government ``clearly have thelegitimate right of self-defense''.   Enaudi also said the U.S. has tried to work out a peacefullysolution of the Panamanian situation thought the OAS but ``it isimpossible to reason with a dictator. At the end, Noriega has gotwhat he deserved.''</TEXT></DOC>
