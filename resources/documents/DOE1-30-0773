Majorriver systems transported sediment to the Basin, where it was depositedin fluvial and deltaic environments on a broad coastal plain and adjacentshallow shelf. Periodic marine transgressions interrupted fluvial anddeltaic sedimentation, resulting in the formation of a series of elongate,sinuous sandstone/siltstone bodies. Some of these were deposited contemporaneouslywith coal-forming swamps. 63 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
