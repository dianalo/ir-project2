Amiram Nir, 38, was buried Tuesday at a suburban Tel Avivcemetery.   Cabinet ministers, Nir's former colleagues and hundreds othersattended the funeral.   Nir, born Amiram Nisker to a family of Holocaust survivors, was aparatrooper and military broadcasting correspondent before becomingadviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime ministers.   In the Iran-Contra affair, he worked closely with U.S. officialsand made trips to Europe and Iran.   Nir resigned to become a private businessman earlier this year.In Mexico, where he died last Wednesday, Nir said he was an avocadoexporter.   Investigators cast doubt on the report because of Nir's past andbecause he used an assumed name when renting the plane in which hewas killed.   ``Amiram lived in a storm and died in a storm,'' Rabin said inhis eulogy at the Kiryat Shaul cemetery. ``His missions led him tomysterious destinations and to veiled affairs, to deep secrets heknew how to keep.''   ``When the shroud of secrecy was suddenly torn from thisanonymous soldier ... he became a focus of international interest,''Rabin said in reference to Iran-Contra. ``He knew how to grind histeeth and sustain even when people tried to harm his good name.''   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev and Cabinet ministers Gad Yaacobyand Yitzhak Modai were among the crowd. Foreign Minister ShimonPeres was seen comforting Nir's mother Miriam, who later lostconsciousness during the funeral ceremony and was given medicaltreatment.   On Tuesday, the dailies Maariv and Hadashot carried an articlefrom the New York-based Newsday newspaper, alleging Nir kept incontact with U.S. intelligence officials until his death.   The report quoted intelligence sources as saying Nir may havebeen involved in a large shipment of Israeli arms that arrived lastweek in port of Veracruz.   It said Mexico apparently decided to import Israeli weapons tocombat an increase in drug trafficking in the state of Michoacanwhere Nir died.   On Monday, an informed Israeli source told The Associated Pressthe former government adviser was a licensed arms dealer. Israeliofficials and Nir's friends and former colleagues denied the claim.</TEXT></DOC>
