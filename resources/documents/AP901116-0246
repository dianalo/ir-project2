But some industry-watchers say the hype may be premature, sincethe multimedia market is small and has yet to find its bearings.   That didn't stop IBM from driving home the point that it isserious about multimedia. A breakfast gathering sponsored by theworld's largest computer company for several hundred computerdealers and other industry insiders was a multimedia show initself.   As the lights dimmed in the basketball stadium where the groupassembled, smoke filled the air and a green laser streaked acrossthe ceiling. Then, from the stadium's balcony, an inflated IBM``spaceship'' the size of a small car floated across the ceilingand hovered above a stage.   The ship sent down a ``transporter'' signal modeled after TV's``Star Trek,'' and an IBM executive appeared in the mist to thesound of eerie music. Meanwhile, outer-space scenes flashed ongiant screens.   IBM later demonstrated a more practical use for multimedia witha computer program that spiced up a high school English lesson onthe poem ``Ulysses.''   On a computer screen it depicted the text of the poem along witha ``window'' featuring pictures of several actors. When anon-screen arrow was moved to one of the photos, a video clip of theactor reading the poem appeared in another window.   The program also featured video clips of critics discussing thepoem and its historical background.   Mike Braun, IBM's vice president for multimedia, called thetechnology ``the next wave of the computer revolution.''   ``It's technology that will push the computer into our everydaylives,'' he said.   IBM demonstrated another use of multimedia, a program thatelectronically ``ages'' a person's photograph on the computerscreen. For this demonstration it used a photo of Bill Gates, the35-year-old chairman of software giant Microsoft Corp., whohappened to be in the audience.   IBM said the program is designed for law-enforcement authoritiesto simulate the aging of a suspect or a missing child.   At a Comdex panel discussion on multimedia, industry officialslisted a number of current and future uses for the technology,including corporate training programs, point-of-sale merchandisedisplays, education programs and entertainment.   ``Some people learn better visually,'' said Nick Arnett, editorof an industry newsletter on multimedia.   The panelists showed videotapes depicting several uses ofmultimedia. In one, used by Volvo dealers, a customer can seecombinations of colors and wheel covers on a car depicted on acomputer screen.   In a program for interior designers, the color scheme of a roomcan be altered on a screen, the furniture moved around and even theeffects of various types of lighting can be depicted.   A third demonstration showed how a magazine could be representedin multimedia. The magazine's pages could be ``turned'' on screen,the articles could be read by a narrator and photographs andgraphics could be enlarged or rotated. This electronic ``magazine''also could highlight key words and provide an outline of thearticles.   ``What we're allowing the reader to do is get into thatmagazine,'' said John Colligan, president of Authorware, a maker ofmultimedia software.   But despite multimedia's promise, even those involved in itadmit the market has yet to find its place or to earn much money.   ``Right now it's a lot of effort but not much return,'' saidWilliam Nisen, president of OWL International, another companydeveloping multimedia software.   A key to multimedia's popularity could be the development oflong-promised high-definition television, Nisen said. That wouldallow vastly sharper images and compact-disc-quality sound on TVsets.   If those future TVs also are based on digital technology ratherthan today's analog, multimedia would get a further boost because adigital TV essentially would be a computer, said Richard Shaffer,editor of Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter.   In a telephone interview, Shaffer said computer companies arebeing driven toward multimedia by the fear that as computertechnology becomes cheaper, they could lose the emerging homecomputer market to consumer electronics companies.   With multimedia, computer makers hope to stake their claim inany home entertainment and information market that will be based onmultimedia, he said.   ``The potential for an entertainment medium is enormous,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
