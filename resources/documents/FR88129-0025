Interested persons were invited to submit comments byApril 5, 1982. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initialcomment period could be submitted by May 5, 1982.In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 30, 1982 (47 FR 13385), the agency advisedthat it had extended the comment period until June 4, 1982, and the replycomment period to July 5, 1982, on the advance notice of proposed rulemakingfor OTC digestive aid drug products to allow for consideration of additionaldata and information. In accordance with andSection; 330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration (address above), after deletionof a small amount of trade secret information. In the tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish Subpart Dof Part 357 (21 CFR Part 357, Subpart D), published elsewhere in this issueof the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> FDA states for the first time its position onthe establishment of a monograph for OTC digestive aid drug products. Inreviewing the Panel's recommendations on OTC digestive aid drug productstogether with the data and comments submitted in response to the advanceof proposed rulemaking on OTC digestive aid drug products, the agency recognizedthat there is significant overlap between the rulemaking on OTC digestiveaid drug products and other rulemakings in the OTC drug review. As discussedin comment seven of the tentative final monograph for OTC digestive aiddrug products, the agency has reviewed and evaluated the available dataand information and has determined that the terms ``bloating,'' ``pressure,''``fullness,'' and ``stuffed feeling'' are appropriate for inclusion inthe antiflatulent monograph to describe the symptoms of gas. In developing the antiflatulent monograph, the agency relied on the resultsof two double-blind studies (Refs. 1 and 2) which demonstrated the effectivenessof simethicone in relieving symptoms of upper gastrointestinal distress.(See 38 FR 31266.) In both studies the symptoms described as ``bloating,''``fullness,'' ``pressure,'' and ``stuffed feeling'' were among those evaluated.In both studies, simethicone was demonstrated to be effective for relievingthese symptoms. In addition, the results of a consumer survey (Ref. 3) indicate that theterms ``bloating,'' ``pressure,'' ``stuffed feeling'' and ``fullness''are very meaningful to and used by consumers in describing what is commonly,if not accurately, referred to as ``gas.'' Based on these data, the agencyis therefore proposing to amend the antiflatulent monograph by adding anadditional indications statement to read as follows: (Select one of thefollowing: ``Alleviates'' or ``Relieves'') (select one or more of the following:``bloating,'' ``pressure,'' ``fullness,'' or ``stuffed feeling'') ``commonlyreferred to as gas.'' Additionally, the agency is proposing to amend the antiflatulent monographto include a ``statement of identity'' section to conform with the formatof other final OTC drug monographs. The agency believes that the term ``antigas''is an appropriate alternative statement of identity to the term ``antiflatulent''provided there are no statements elsewhere in the labeling implying thatthe symptoms are caused by the presence of excess gas. For example, phrasessuch as ``antigas formulation relieves gas trapped in the intestine'' or``for gas pain'' would be considered inappropriate. The agency has alsoslightly modified the existing indication to conform with the newly proposedindication. <ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Kasich, A., ``A Summary of a Double-Blind Study Comparing theEffectiveness of Simethicone and Placebo in the Relief of Symptoms of FunctionalDisease of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract,'' copy of unpublished studyincluded in OTC Volume 17GTFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) ``A Summary of the Double-Blind Study of the Effectiveness ofSimethicone in Relieving the Symptoms of Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Distress,''copy of unpublished study included in OTC Volume 17GTFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Petition from Plough, Inc., dated May 18, 1976, on file underDocket No. 76P-0218, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG>The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC antiflatulentdrug products, is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC antiflatulent drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposedrule, if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. The agency has determined that under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this actionis of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1988, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, written comments or objections on theproposed regulation.

In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consideronly data submitted prior to the closing of the administrative record onMarch 29, 1988. Data submitted after the closing of the administrativerecord will be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>unless the Commissioner finds good cause hasbeen shown that warrants earlier consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 332</ITAG>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Antiflatulent drug products.
