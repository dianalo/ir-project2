From resonance-shift measurement, the magnetichyperfine-splitting frequency {mu}/sub M/, g-factor and magnetic hyperfinefield were derived as {mu}/sub M/=102.61(3)MH/sub z/, g(9/2/sup +/)=0.188(16)and B/sub HF/(/sup 73/SeFe)=716(81)kG. The experimental values of theg-factors of the g/sub 9/2/ neutron states, in the neighborhood of theneutron number 40, are compared with the theoretical values based onthe core-polarization model.</TEXT></DOC>
