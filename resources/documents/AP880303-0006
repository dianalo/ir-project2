Ultimately, these staggering costs areborne by the average citizen _ and nearly 75 percent of Americansdon't even smoke.   ``It makes no sense that while the Surgeon General's office iswaging a campaign against smoking, the federal government isinvolved in price supports for tobacco. And it's illogical forpoliticians to bemoan the grave health consequences of tobaccowhile, at the same time, supporting its production.   ``I believe the federal government should get out of tobaccoproduction, and continue its campaign to ducate the public on thedangers of smoking ... A user fee on tobacco products would serveas an added incentive to stop smoking. Revenues from such a feeshould be earmarked exclusively for meeting the long-term healthcare needs of our older citizens.''   Here are the Democrats' replies:</TEXT><HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>   ``In Massachusetts, I have supported policies to protect therights of non-smokers. And as president, I would support a vigorouspublic health campaign to encourage smokers to quit and toincourage young people from taking up the habit.   ``I do not favor direct taxpayer subsidies to farmers who growtobacco. However, I do not oppose the tobacco industry's own effortto provide economic assistance through the existing CommodityCredit Corporation loan program, which operates at no net cost tothe taxpayer. And I strongly support efforts to encourage tobaccofarmers to diversify so that they can deal with the economic impactof what I hope will be continuing progress towards a smoke-freesociety.''</TEXT><HEAD>RICHARD GEPHARDT</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I do support the current federal program. There are a lot ofsmall- and medium-sized farmers who depend on that program to givethem a fair price. When properly run, this program does not costthe government any money: it's paid for by the people who smokecigarettes.   ``I support measures to ban smoking on commercial airlines onshort flights and to restrict smoking to certain areas on longerflights. Also, although I do not favor a total ban on advertisingand promotion of tobacco products, I do support an active publiceducation campaign to inform people of the potential adverseeffects that tobacco products can have on our health.''</TEXT><HEAD>ALBERT GORE JR.</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I support the current federal program for tobacco which isfunded entirely by the contributions of growers and processors anddoes not rely at all on taxpayers' dollars. The current programhelps many small tobacco farmers stay in business.   ``I believe the government should do everything in its power toeducate the public about the hazards associated with smoking. Ihave been a strong supporter of stronger warning labels oncigarette packages and other mechanisms to inform the public ofsmoking-related health risks. I believe public education willresult in a gradually decreasing demand for tobacco products.</TEXT><HEAD>GARY HART</HEAD><TEXT>   Campaign aide Jay Angoff said Hart does not support pricesupports because ``it makes no sense on the one hand to pay peopleto grow tobacco and then for us as a society to incur thetremendous costs that tobacco imposes.''   On anti-smoking efforts, Angoff said Hart ``certainly wouldn'tspend a lot of money on it, but he would use the powers of thepresidency to make people aware of the harm smoking causes.''</TEXT><HEAD>JESSE JACKSON</HEAD><TEXT>   ``In general I support the federal tobacco program although .. .I would like to see the tobacco program reformed so that smallfamily farms benefit more than they currently do. At the presenttime production quotas are distributed in a way that favorscorporate farmers and neglects the family farmer who is thebackbone of the rural South. ...   ``As long as there is a demand for tobacco and people who maketheir livelihood from meeting that demand, the federal governmentshould offer its assistance.   ``But we have to recognize that 350,000 deaths per year arerelated to smoking. The government must beef-up educational effortsto inform the public of this hazard. Just as importantly, we mustmake every effort possible to assist farmers to diversify out oftobacco production if they so desire. We should consider using someportion of the 16 cent tobacco excise tax to fund such an effort.''</TEXT><HEAD>PAUL SIMON</HEAD><TEXT>   ``The tobacco industry is very clear about getting the messageacross that the current tobacco program does not cost thetaxpayers. While that may be true of the program that assiststobacco farmers, the fact is that smoking costs all of us greatly.   ``I believe we must expand government efforts to discouragepeople from smoking. ... I believe we must begin to take steps toprotect non-smokers from the adverse effects of smoking. Igenerally support legislative efforts to discourage smoking. I amco-sponsor of legislation that would double the federal excise taxon tobacco products. ...   ``This would have the effect of pricing tobacco products out ofthe reach of those most susceptible to developing a long-termsmoking habit: teen-agers.''</TEXT></DOC>
