The black bear head count likely will reach a record 2,700 bythe end of the season Thursday, said Craig R. McLaughlin of theMaine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department. The harvest hasbeen creeping upward since 1985, when 1,533 were shot, to 2,651last year.   Maine currently has an estimated 17,000 to 20,000 bears,department biologist Ken Elowe said. The optimum level is 21,000,McLaughlin said.   ``Our (bear) population is by no means in trouble,'' saidMcLaughlin, who noted the state still has the largest bearpopulation east of the Mississippi River.   But if the population is to get back to the target, the seasonalharvest must be cut to no more than 2,100, he said.   William Vail, the state fish and wildlife commissioner, said``the increasing harvest trend is likely setting the stage forfurther and more dramatic declines in the population.''   Vail wants to eliminate four weeks of bear hunting in 1990 and1991.   Bears roam every section of the state except the more heavilypopulated southern coastal region, McLaughlin said.   When food is scarce, usually in the summer when they are eatingthe most, bears occasionally wander into towns and dumps lookingfor food.   They have been known to peer inside screen doors in the northernMaine hunting outpost of Greenville, and as many as three have beenspotted within the city limits of the state capital, Augusta,within a single summer, said Paul Fournier, spokesman for the gamedepartment.   But black bears are intelligent and secretive and no easy preyfor hunters, McLaughlin said. The bears normally weigh 250 poundsfully grown and occasionally weigh more than 500 pounds, yet theyare surprisingly quick, he said.   Officials say bear hunters also may be attracted by what theysee as a macho experience.   ``They know they can come to Maine and have a quality hunt,''said Fournier.   Officials do not know exactly how many bear hunters there are inMaine, since the state does not issue special bear permits.   ``But the word we get from the field is that they're getting ineach other's way a little more,'' McLaughlin said.   The state has scheduled three public hearings in December to getreaction from hunters, guides and others to the proposal to shortenthe hunting season.</TEXT></DOC>
