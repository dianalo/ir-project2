The observed pulse shiftof Pb using an oxygenated graphite surface in 1 atm of inert gas indicatesthat the shift observed in an oxygen-containing sheath gas in not entirelydue to the oxygen in the gas phase. The absence of a shift with vaporizationfrom an oxygenated surface under vacuum indicates it is not strictlya surface process. Mass spectra data show more CO and CO{sub 2} are evolvedfrom an oxygenated surface than from an unoxygenated surface. SeparateGFAAS studies show that andgt;30% CO{sub 2} introduced into the Ar sheathgas produces a shift equivalent to that seen off of an oxygenated surface.However, the mass spectra data coupled with diffusion calculations suggestthat a maximum of approximately 0.84% CO{sub 2} exists within the furnacefrom the CO{sub 2} desorbed from the graphite surface. Unless other sourcesof CO{sub 2} can be found, these data indicate that this desorbed CO{sub2} may not be responsible for the shift. Pure CO used as a sheath gasin GFAAS produces an early shift in the PB absorbance pulse and thereforeis not responsible for the late shifts that have been observed. The shiftmay depend on the resulting quantities of CO and CO{sub 2} in the furnaceand the relative oxidative character of the furnace environment.</TEXT></DOC>
