Revenue is expected to decline to about $40 million, said Bruce W. Wilkinson, president and chief executive officer. A year earlier, the engineering and construction concern posted profit of $1.2 million on revenue of $44.8 million.    Mr. Wilkinson, elaborating on an announcement made earlier yesterday about the earnings charge, said between 65% and 71% of the charge would involve write-offs of goodwill carried on the company's books from all past acquisitions. The remaining charge will include future expenses for early retirement programs, consolidation of offices in the U.S. and overseas and an increase in the general reserve fund for contingencies.    But after biting the bullet, the company believes it is poised for a turnaround. &quot;We think we are going to go into the new year with the strongest backlog of work ever in our history,&quot; Mr. Wilkinson said in an interview.    He said the company expects to bounce back from the fiscal third-quarter loss with fourth-quarter net income in the range of 35 cents to 45 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of $1.6 million, or 40 cents a share.    In fiscal 1988, the company expects earnings to be bolstered by a one-time, after-tax gain of at least $6 million from the termination of CRS Sirrine's &quot;benefit retirement plan.&quot; It will be replaced by an &quot;incentive-driven&quot; program. Additionally, the new federal tax law is expected to drop the company's tax rate from 46% to 34% &quot;at the minimum,&quot; Mr. Wilkinson said.    Mr. Wilkinson characterized the write-off as part of a restructuring plan that involves making CRS Sirrine &quot;lean and hard&quot; and repositioning it solidly in the domestic market. In 1983, CRS Sirrine did half of its architectural, engineering and construction work in the U.S., compared with 90% today. Total staff has been trimmed to 2,200 people from 3,000.    CRS Sirrine would like to become an industry leader in the building and ownership of unregulated power and cogeneration projects. Cogeneration plants manufacture steam and electricity simultaneously by burning one fuel. The company has already built about 100 such plants, primarily in the pulp and paper, food and pharmaceutical industries.    But CRS Sirrine is also building a Pennsylvania cogeneration plant using what it claims to be the &quot;technology of the future&quot; -- taking unsightly mountains of waste-coal byproduct and burning them to produce electricity, Mr. Wilkinson noted. The 30,000-kilowatt power plant, near Pottsville, is expected to begin supplying power and producing revenue by this fall. The plant is owned by a partnership of CRS Sirrine and Combustion Engineering Inc., an engineering and construction concern based in Stamford, Conn.    Increasing consumer outcry over the high electricity rates of nuclear-laden utilities will spur demand for low-cost fuel sources, such as cogeneration plants, Mr. Wilkinson said. &quot;It does seem to us that the nuclear facilities are going to add some very high rates in time (to utility consumers),&quot; he said. &quot;Ultimately that is the major issue.&quot;    Under federal law, public utilities are required to purchase some of the excess electricity produced by cogeneration plants.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CRS Sirrine fell 50 cents, to $17.875. </TEXT></DOC>
