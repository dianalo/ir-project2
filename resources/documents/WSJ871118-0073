On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December crude-oil contract, which expires Friday, broke the key $18.50 barrier and closed at $18.40 a barrel, down 25 cents, after a day of nervous trading. January-delivery crude settled at $18.37, down 18 cents. The December and January closes were the lowest since Aug. 24.    Responding to the negative price outlook, most U.S. refiners lowered the prices they'll pay to crude-oil producers so-called field postings.    Citgo Petroleum Corp., a unit of Southland Corp.; Conoco Inc., a unit of Du Pont Co.; Phillips 66 Co., a unit of Phillips Petroleum Co.; Sun Company Inc. and Scurlock Oil Co., a unit of Ashland Oil Inc., were among those to lower field postings for the U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, by 50 cents a barrel to $18. On the spot, or non-contract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate fell to $18.40 a barrel.    Price discounting is spreading among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, particularly Iran, as the cartel continues to produce oil at excessively high levels. Among traders, it was difficult to find an optimist.    &quot;I think oil is in a critical phase right now,&quot; said Chris McCormack, an oil broker for E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York. &quot;It's become a difficult market&quot; to sell, even at discounts.    Rick Donovan, head of the international-energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York, said there has been an almost 9% &quot;correction&quot; in crude-oil prices since three weeks ago, when crude cost a little over $20.    &quot;I was surprised by the quickness of the drop,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought it would be sideways with a slow erosion of prices,&quot; leading up to the OPEC meeting in Vienna Dec. 9. The lower prices go, Mr. Donovan said, the higher the possibility of a price accord at the meeting. &quot;They seem to do better when the pressure's on,&quot; he said.    On the Merc, December-delivery heating-oil contracts fell 0.64 cent to 55.20 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for December fell 0.52 cent to 49.09 cents a gallon.    Despite OPEC unrest and oversupply, traders may be reluctant to push crude-futures prices below the $18 level, said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. The last several OPEC meetings have moved prices upward, hurting speculators who bet the reverse. &quot;People have gotten burned,&quot; Mr. Rothman said.    Also pressuring prices was the expectation that this week's inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute would show another increase in U.S. crude stockpiles of as much as two million barrels. The statistics, released after the market closed, showed a more-moderate 1.6 million-barrel increase for the week ended last Friday from the previous week to 355.8 million barrels.    However, heating-oil stocks soared 5.5 million barrels to 127.3 million barrels, the institute report said. Analysts interviewed by Dow Jones News Service's International Petroleum Report newswire earlier in the day had expected an increase of about 360,000 barrels.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices turned around following Monday's setback, as a sharp fall in inventories prompted active demand for contracts. December-delivery copper rose 1.80 cents a pound to $1.001 on New York's Commodity Exchange, while March posted a gain of 0.85 cent to settle at 92.35 cents. The December-to-March premium, which narrowed to 6.80 cents Monday, rebounded to 7.75 cents. Stocks of copper in Comex warehouses at Monday's close fell 4,653 tons from Friday to 43,300 tons. Analysts and trade sources tried to pinpoint the reason for Monday's 4.30-cent decline in the December contract in the face of an unchanged bullish supply-demand situation. One dealer attributed the drop to traders who bought call options that matured Friday, at which time they exercised their right to take delivery of December contracts. As the options had been bought some time ago and had increased in value, he said, the traders Monday sold the December contracts they received Friday, to take profits. A futures option confers the right to buy or sell a futures contract while a contract is a commitment to accept or deliver a commodity. An analyst, who agreed with the scenario, said, &quot;Traders have been focusing on the December (contract) and cueing their trades off that month. When it was strong, it indicated supply tightness. Monday was the first time in months that it showed significant softness, and it led some traders to believe the supply tightness might be easing.&quot; The increase in Comex margins, or good-faith deposits to buy contracts, as well as the possibility another increase may be made at a special meeting of the Comex board today, also depressed prices Monday, the analyst said.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices fell in step with declining expectations by traders of significant cuts being made in the federal-budget deficit by White House and Capitol Hill conferees. Broad stock-market indexes also fell as traders said few buyers appeared willing to bet a bottom had been reached in the continuing market slide. U.S. Treasury bond-future prices slumped as well, following the dollar. But a weaker greenback sent prices of foreign-currency futures rebounding from Monday's decline. &quot;This is a flight to quality,&quot; and stocks and stock-index futures &quot;are no longer a part of it,&quot; said Dale Pinkert, a partner with American Federal Futures Inc. in Phoenix.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures jumped their daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound in response to an Agriculture Department report that the number of feed-lot cattle sold for slaughter in October increased 6% from a year ago, about double the rate traders expected, said Philip Stanley, a livestock analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities, Chicago. As expected, the department's monthly seven-state survey said the number of cattle on feed lots as of Nov. 1 was up 11% from last year, and the number of young cattle put on feed lots in the month increased 8%. Hog-futures prices also rose. </TEXT></DOC>
