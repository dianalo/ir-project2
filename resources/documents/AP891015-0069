No negotiations were scheduled in the nearly 2-week-old strikeby machinists, but contract talks were set to begin Monday betweenBoeing and its second-largest union, representing engineers andtechnical workers.   Members of United Aerospace Workers Local 1069, which representsabout 3,200 hourly production and maintenance workers at BoeingHelicopters' suburban Philadelphia plant, met Sunday after a 10-daycontract extension expired at midnight.   Company spokesman Robert Torgerson said the workers agreed toanother extension, with a 10-day notification requirement to cancelfor either side.   ``We're just continuing to talk,'' Torgerson said. ``The majorissues are wages and benefits.''   Neither Local 1069 president Anthony Forte nor Art Andrews,chairman of the Local 1069 strike committee, were available Sundayto comment, according to a person answering the union's telephone.   Neither side has released details in the contract dispute.   The contract at the helicopter plant expired Oct. 4, but bothsides agreed to hold off any strike or lockout for at least 10days, with the contract remaining in effect through the period.   Boeing Helicopter has a total of about 6,500 employees. Theplant's operations have not been affected by the Machinists unionstrike elsewhere at Boeing because the hourly workers arerepresented by a different union.   Boeing Helicopter builds Army CH-47D Chinook helicopters and isa partner with Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. to develop the V-22Osprey tilt-rotor plane for the Defense Department. It alsoproduces components for Boeing commercial jet transports.   The Machinists union's 57,800 members at Boeing walked out Oct.4 after overwhelmingly rejecting a new contract offer from theworld's largest commercial jet builder. About 43,300 strikers arein the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland,Ore., and lesser numbers at a half-dozen other locations.   Dan Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle ProfessionalEngineering Employees Association, said negotiators for that unionand Boeing probably would meet Monday and Tuesday, then holdsporadic sessions as needed over the next three weeks.   Their contract expires Dec. 1, but no one expects a strike bythe unaffiliated group, which represents nearly 28,000 engineers,scientists, manual writers, draftsmen and other technical workers.</TEXT></DOC>
