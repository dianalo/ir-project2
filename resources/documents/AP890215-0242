The military's wartime fuel needs could be met by a combinationof domestic oil production, imports from reliable suppliers and theStrategic Petroleum Reserve, the government's underground stockpileof 555 million barrels, the Commerce Department study said.   It added that forced curtailment of fuel use by the generalpublic during wartime would result in serious economic hardships.   ``Our analysis concludes that the United States will be able tomeet direct and indirect military petroleum requirements during amajor conventional war,'' said the report, released Tuesday.   The report was prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau ofExport Administration at the request of a coalition of energyindustry groups, which asserted in a petition that the domestic oilindustry has been so damaged by rising imports that it could notmeet the military's fuel needs in the event of a major war.   In rejecting the industry group's claim, the Commerce Departmentsaid the group had underestimated the extent to which fuel use inthe private sector could be reduced in the event of a nationaldefense mobilization and an actual military conflict.   The report said civilian use of fuel could be reduced by morethan the 10 percent assumed by the industry group.   Meanwhile, an industry trade group said U.S. oil imports soaredto more than 8 million barrels per day in January for the first timesince 1980 as demand rose sharply and domestic production continuedto dwindle.   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oilproducers and refiners, said U.S. oil production fell to 7.9 millionbarrels a day, a 3.4 percent drop from January 1988.   Imports of oil surged to an average of 8.2 million barrels a day,an increase of 20.6 percent over the January 1988 level of 6.8million barrels. It was the first month that imports averaged morethan 8 million barrels since 1980, the API said.   The Commerce Department report recommended a series of actionsaimed at improving U.S. energy security. These included:   _Removing the remaining controls on the price of natural gas.This would be expected to increase use of natural gas, thus helpingreduce the need for oil imports.   _Permit oil exploration and development on the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge Coastal Plain in Alaska and on the Outer ContinentalShelf. The industry considers these the most promising domestic oilprospects, although opponents say drilling in these areas wouldcause too much environmental damage.   _Providing greater tax incentives for independent oil drillers.   All three recommendations are contained as well in PresidentBush's 1990 budget.   The report assumed 1987 levels of domestic oil production, orabout 8.3 million barrels a day. Output last year fell to about 8.2million barrels daily and the Energy Department foresees anaccelerating decline in the 1990s.   Domestic oil production has been declining since 1986, when worldoil prices collapsed from about $30 a barrel to below $10 a barrel.Prices currently are in a range of $15-$17 a barrel, which thenation's oil producers contend is too low to prevent a further dropin production and rise in imports.   The Energy Department said last month that oil imports, currentlyrunning at about 38 percent of total oil supplies, would jump above50 percent by 1994 and could approach 60 percent before the end ofthe century.   The Commerce report said the nation was better prepared for anenergy crisis than in 1979, when a brief pinch on Iranian oilsupplies sent world oil prices soaring, but that nevertheless``petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''   Jim Groninger, director of governmental affairs for theIndependent Petroleum Association of America, said his group wasdisappointed in the report's outcome.   ``It came to the right conclusions, in that there is a nationalsecurity issue here, but it didn't take the next logical step inpromoting a serious set of solutions,'' Groninger said.</TEXT></DOC>
