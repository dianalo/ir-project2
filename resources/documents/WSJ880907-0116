Salisbury, president of Employee Benefit Research Institute. While he expects the government to require some new benefits, Mr. Salisbury thinks other legislative pushes, such as the continuing drive to tax benefits, will make the extras attractive to only a small number of employees -- and thus too costly for all but the biggest firms to administer.    Multi-option &quot;cafeteria plans&quot; may backfire, warns Warren L. Moser, a vice president at United HealthCare Inc. in Baltimore. Individual costs typically fall when benefits are shared by a large number of employees, he notes. But such economies of scale can't be tapped if cafeteria plans spread the money among many options.    The benefits director at one major corporation takes a middle ground: He believes options will increase, but companies will halt, or at least slow, the rapid rise in how much they pay. He predicts more companies will move toward &quot;defined-contribution&quot; benefits, increasing corporate-provided benefits by a fixed dollar amount each year. As a result, he says, employees will often end up paying a bigger share.    Employers, for instance, are already limiting medical insurance, where premiums have shot up 35% or more, and will shrink those benefits especially for retirees, who are living longer and racking up bigger bills.    Other items will come under closer scrutiny. Psychological services, for example, will be offered more widely. But unlike most employers these days, companies will control whether an employee has five years of analysis or ten sessions of family therapy.    Many employees have come to expect the company to provide and pay for their benefits, no questions asked, says the corporate-benefits director. &quot;In the future,&quot; he says, &quot;I just don't think that will be the case.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;The Future Look of Employee Benefits --- Mortgage Aid and Paid Leaves Seen as Likely&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 7, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
