The Afghan government called it an accident, saying the missilemissed its guerrilla target near Jalalabad and landed across theborder. But it refused to apologize and again accused Islamabad ofaiding the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.   The missile hit about 500 yards inside the border early Friday.It damaged a post office in the village of Torkham but injured noone, government officials said.   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying theincident was a ``brazen act of provocation by the Kabul regimewhich was clearly designed to internationalize the situation inAfghanistan in order to save itself from the wrath of its ownpeople.''   Pakistan pledged to ``take all the necessary measures to defenditself, and the lives and property of its citizens against suchattacks,'' the statement said.   The missile _ with a range of up to 175 miles _ was believedlaunched from the Afghan capital, about 120 miles west of thePakistan border. The guerrillas launched an offensive in March onJalalabad, 45 miles west of the border, and government troops havebeen blasting the Jalalabad area with SS-1 Scud missiles.   In Kabul, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amanisaid the missile landed over the border by mistake.   ``It was an accident,'' he said, adding: ``We do not need toapologize when Pakistan is conducting its onslaught without anyapology.''   Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of sending militarypersonnel into Afghanistan to orchestrate Moslem rebel attacks ongovernment troops, who have been left to defend the country after aSoviet troop pullout was completed in February. Pakistan deniesdirect involvement.   Amani said the missile strike caused casualties but he did notelaborate.   In the battle for Jalalabad, Amani said 78 guerrillas and ninecivilians were killed in the last 24 hours and asserted that nogovernment troops were killed. The report could not be verified.   Amani also said that as of Saturday afternoon, Foreign MinisterAbdul Wakil was still waiting in Moscow for the United States togrant him a visa to travel to U.N. headquarters in New York. He iscarrying an appeal from President Najib for an urgent U.N. SecurityCouncil session to address the Afghan crisis.   The Pakistani statement claimed the missile incident was a ployto convince the Security Council to debate the Afghan crisis eventhough the charter of the 15-nation council prohibits debate ondomestic issues.   ``The regime has resorted to its standard litany of baseless andirrelevant allegations against Pakistan in an attempt to portraythe situation inside Afghanistan as a bilateral problem withPakistan that would threaten international peace,'' the statementsaid.   The Afghan charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Officeand warned ``the responsibility for serious consequences that arisefrom such an attack rests entirely on the Kabul government.''   In March, a Scud missile landed about 300 yards from the borderon the Afghan side of Torkham. Islamabad said at the time it wasnot concerned with what happened inside Afghan territory.   Moscow gave Kabul the missiles in November despite protests fromPakistan.   Moslem insurgents headquartered in Pakistan and Iran have wagedmore than a decade of war against Kabul's communist government.Beginning in December 1979, Moscow sent more than 100,000 troopsinto Afghanistan to replace one communist government with another.   In April 1988, an agreement was signed in Geneva providing forthe withdrawal of the Red Army force. Moscow and Washington havecontinued to supply weapons to their respective allies.</TEXT></DOC>
