Research and development was conducted for SIGMA(System for Interactive Geothermal Mapping and Assessment) which is atotal survey information system concerning geothermal resources. Sincethe start of its development, this system has been improved in hardware,software, and data. The total number of lines in software developed forSIGMA is about 300,000. The achievements thus far are as follows. (1)Part of basic data about geothermal resources in Japan has been implementedin the database; mainly, retrieval and graphic output functions havebeen improved. (2) Basic types of survey data have arranged; a prototypeof an integrated in patterns as mentioned above and for graphic outputhas been created. (3) SIGMA is now used as a system equipped with variousanalysis programs and utility routines which can be used in common andwith various output devices. (8 figs, 4 tabs, 15 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
