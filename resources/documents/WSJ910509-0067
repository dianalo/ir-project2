He didn't make any specific sales or profitforecast.   Unfavorable exchange rates were largely blamed for thecompany's 5.8% drop in group profit in 1990 to 2.27 billionSwiss francs ($1.56 billion). Sales were down 3.5% to 46.37billion francs from 48.04 billion francs in 1989.   First-quarter sales in 1991 slipped 1.8% to 11.1 billionfrancs from 11.3 billion francs, largely because of continuedunfavorable currency translations, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
