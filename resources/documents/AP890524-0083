The Tokyo-based Prometron Technics allegedly exported anunspecified amount of hafnium to East Germany in 1986 and 1987without clearance from the Japanese government, a police officialsaid on condition of anonymity.   Executives of the company, which has a branch office in EastBerlin, allegedly carried the metallic chemical element in theirluggage when they traveled to the East bloc country, the officialsaid.   Prometron Technics maintains technology swaps with EastGermany's Electrotechnic Export and Import Corporation and severalother East German companys, he said.   Hafnium is principally used to make control rods for reactors onnuclear-powered vessels and submarines. It is among a list of itemsstrictly regulated by the Coordinating Committee on MultilateralExport Control, a Paris-based watchdog body that controls trade instrategic items with the communist bloc.   Police on May 9 searched the offices of Prometron Technics andthe home of the company president, Hirokuni Matsuda, the officialsaid.   He said an investigation into whether the firm violated customslaws and foreign exchange and control laws is still under way.Violators face up to five years in prison.   The case is the tenth involving Japanese firms accused ofviolating the watchdog agency rules since 1985.   In 1987, Toshiba Machine Co., a subsidiary of electronics giantToshiba Corp., sold sophisticated propeller milling equipment tothe Soviet Union in 1986 in violation of committee rules.   U.S. officials charged the equipment helped the Sovietsmanufacture quieter submarines, and thus undermined Westernsecurity. The incident prompted the U.S. government to prohibitToshiba Machine exports to the United States for three yearsbeginning in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
