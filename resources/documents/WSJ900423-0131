Nor does the release necessarily pave the way for warmerU.S. relations with Iran, whose Islamic government inspiresthe Lebanese Shiites holding Western hostages. President Bushindicated he won't make substantial gestures of gratitudeuntil all the American hostages are freed.</LP><TEXT>   Robert Polhill, 55 years old, a teacher at BeirutUniversity College, was turned over to Syrian officials inBeirut yesterday afternoon and driven to Damascus. Mr.Polhill had been in captivity since a Shiite group calledIslamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine kidnapped himand two other educators on Jan. 24, 1987.   U.S. officials insisted that they didn't do any bargainingor make any concessions to win freedom for Mr. Polhill. Asenior State Department official called it an &quot;unconditionalrelease.&quot;   Iran, which seems to want to remove the hostage issue asan obstacle to winning more economic cooperation from theWest, paved the way for the release by sending a series ofpublic and private signals to the hostage holders during thepast few months that it finally wanted to end the issue. ButSyria, which is working to improve its relations with theWest as its backing from the Soviet Union wanes, played themajor role in arranging details of the release, senior U.S.officials said.   In fact, there was a last-minute debate among U.S.officials about whether the White House should publicly thankIran at all for its role or simply thank Syria. In the end,the White House composed a statement thanking both Syria andIran for their roles, but in remarks to reporters, Mr. Bushsaid, &quot;I can't tell you I honestly know&quot; what Iran's role wasin the release.   The problem for the U.S. now is that the release of onehostage will raise public expectations about freedom for all.And the release of just one captive may make the rest of thehostage problem even tougher for the Bush administration tohandle.   Specifically, both the Lebanese captors and Iran's leadersmay look for some gesture of gratitude from the U.S. beforefreeing other hostages. But American officials said Mr.Bush's offer to show &quot;good will&quot; toward those who help freehostages doesn't apply until all U.S. hostages are out.Doling out rewards -- such as moving faster to settlingdisputes over frozen Iranian assets -- after just one hostagerelease would smack of paying off the captors, U.S. officialsfear.   President Bush signaled as much yesterday. &quot;I'm notlooking for gestures,&quot; he told a group of reporters. &quot;I'mlooking for the release of our hostages -- and by ourhostages I mean all of them.&quot;   But freeing the others won't be easily accomplishedbecause it requires working with a labyrinth of terroristgroups and demands. Though all the groups holding hostagesare believed to be loosely affiliated with Hezbollah, apro-Iranian Lebanese Shiite organization, they have a varietyof demands.   The group that freed Mr. Polhill, the Islamic Jihad forthe Liberation of Palestine, still holds two more Americans.It has demanded the release of hundreds of Shiite prisonersheld in Israel, particularly the release of a leading Shiitecleric, Shiek Abdel Karim Obeid, kidnapped by Israel lastyear.   Other groups have held Americans even longer and madetougher demands. Two Americans -- including the hostage heldlongest, journalist Terry Anderson -- are held by a groupcalled Islamic Jihad. Its main demand has been that Kuwaitfree a group of Shiite extremists it arrested for a series ofterrorist bombings. The Kuwaiti government hasn't shown anyinterest in releasing extremists, and the U.S. has refused topressure Kuwait, arguing that it would amount to knucklingunder to terrorist demands.   Another group holding Americans is the so-calledRevolutionary Justice Organization. It has held hostagesmostly in hopes of trading them for guarantees that Hezbollahmilitiamen will be allowed to operate freely in southernLebanon -- guarantees that can't be provided by the U.S. butonly by Syria, whose army controls much of Lebanon.   The big factor working to the administration's advantageis the apparent cooperation of Syria and Iran in ending thehostage crisis. Syria seems to be accommodating in partbecause its economy is in the doldrums and its longtimepatron, the Soviet Union, has ceased being a reliablesupplier of arms. Moreover, Syrian President Hafez al Assadalso may see an opportunity to win favor with the U.S. andbecome the dominant figure in the Arab world at a time whenhis arch-enemy, Iraq, has been caught trying to illegallyimport nuclear technology and weapons from the U.S. andBritain.   Iran also appears interested in economics. Its president,Hashemi Rafsanjani, apparently wants greater Westerncooperation in rebuilding the Iranian economy, torn apart bythe long war with Iraq.   Specifically, Mr. Rafsanjani probably is hoping forgreater British and German help in rebuilding important oilfacilities damaged by the war. Also, an end to the hostagecrisis might speed a settlement of billions of dollars inclaims that have been outstanding between Iran and the U.S.since the 1979 Iranian revolution.   Iran still has hundreds of millions of dollars depositedin escrow accounts set up to provide funds for settlingclaims by U.S. companies and individuals who lost property inthe revolution. In addition, Iran has claimed it is owed $11billion for undelivered or defective military equipment fromthe U.S. -- a figure that American officials consider wildlyexaggerated.   ---   Michel McQueen in Islamorada, Fla., contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
