Mostpolymers contain plasticizers, antioxidants, or stabilizers which influencetheir stability towards ionising radiations and radiation cross-linking.The effect of various agents on the cross-linking of polypropylene andpolyethylene has been investigated. For comparison the effect of addingdifferent types and quantities of cross-linking agents to commercialPVC were investigated. Irradiations were carried out at an industrialradiation facility, Iso-Ster, and gel content, tensile strength, elongationand hardness were measured.</TEXT></DOC>
