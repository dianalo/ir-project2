About 500 radical students brandishing metal pipes, clubs androcks hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police as the Rev. MoonIk-hwan went on trial for making a trip to North Korea to discussunifying the nations.   ``Release unification fighter Moon Ik-hwan!'' students yelled,``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!''   Several hundred police with shields defended themselves byswinging captured metal pipes. Some students and police wereinjured, but numbers were unavailable on arrests or injuries.   Students from at least four colleges took part in the clash,which occurred on a city street in front of Seoul's SogangUniversity.   About 1,500 police guarded the courthouse where Moon's trialopened.   Police arrested 13 radical students, chanting anti-governmentslogans, who seized the rooftop of a nearby six-story building anderected a large banner saying ``immediately release patrioticunification fighter Moon.''   Moon was brought to the courthouse in prison garb under heavysecurity. His hands were tied with rope, but he smiled and waved atsupporters.   The trial opening was delayed when about 200 Moon supportersmounted a sit-in outside the courtroom demanding they be allowed touse courtroom seats occupied by 50 police officers.   No arrests were reported. The judge asked some officers to leaveso that more Moon supporters could be seated.   Moon is charged with violation of the National Security Law forhis nine-day trip to the north in March. He talked to North Koreanleader Kim Il Sung about national unification, a popular issue withstudent protesters in the capitalist south.   South Korea's anti-communist government forbids unsanctionedtrips to North Korea, its bitter enemy, and maintains that dialogueon unification must be carried out through government channels. Ifconvicted, Moon could face the death penalty, although that is notconsidered likely.   Also today, arrest warrants were issued for three radicalstudents the government says have encouraged people to participatein the World Youth Festival, which is to be held in North Korea July1-8. The government has banned participation.   The students have been charged with violation of nationalsecurity laws, prosecutors said.   Moon, 71, and his traveling companion Yoo Won-ho, a 59-year-oldbusinessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to Seoulafter stops in Beijing and Tokyo. They have been in jail since then.   Defense lawyers argued that the prosecution should drop chargesagainst Moon and Yoo on grounds the indictment is unconstitutional.Repeating his earlier statements, Moon told the court that hevisited the north to seek reunification.   The Korean peninsula was divided after World War II. In 1950, thenorth invaded the south and started the three-year Korean War.</TEXT></DOC>
