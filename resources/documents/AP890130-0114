SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Observers in Congress, universities and publicinterest groups questioned the fairness and wisdom Monday of givingbig pay raises to dozens of senior federal judges who, like formerChief Justice Warren E. Burger, do no legal work.   All 306 senior federal judges _ even those who no longer wield agavel _ will see their salaries rise by about 50 percent unlessCongress disapproves raises due for top federal officials Feb. 8.   Burger's salary, for example, will increase by $60,000 to$175,000 a year.   ``We need to look into this much further,'' said Rep. CarlosMoorhead, who last year sidetracked an effort to lower theeligibility age for senior status.   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said the California Republican, whosits on the House courts subcommittee and is a member of a nationalcommission studying the future of the federal judiciary.   Moorhead said the commission might look at the issue, andCongress may want to study ``establishing some minimum work toqualify for the raises.''   David Keating of the 150,000-member National Taxpayers Union, apublic interest group that promotes tax and spending reduction,decried giving more money to all senior judges.   ``It's appalling that they're getting huge salaries for doingnothing and now are receiving substantial pay raises for continuingto do nothing,'' Keating said. ``There ought to be some minimumstandard of work to qualify for any pay raise.''   Older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify foractive-duty pay raises even after stepping down from full-time duty.When he retired as chief justice in 1986, Burger's salary was$108,400. He chose senior status, and in 1987 his judicial salaryrose to $115,000 when his successor's pay rose to that level.   Burger, who is working full-time as the unpaid chairman of theanniversary celebration of the Constitution, declined to discuss hispay increase other than to say, ``I'm too busy to sit.''   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option providedby Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on theirlast day of work.   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with15 years experience, or 70 with 10 years.   Administrative records obtained by The Associated Press indicatethat roughly one in five of the nation's senior judges do nojudicial work whatsoever. Only 13 former judges have passed upsenior status to choose full retirement.   The law allows senior judges to turn down any work they don'twant.   Robert Raven, a San Francisco lawyer and president of theAmerican Bar Association, emphasized that senior judges ``as a wholedo so much for the federal judiciary'' but said a senior judgereceiving pay raises for no work ``is a little disturbing in any oneinstance.''   Lloyd Cutler, a prominent Washington attorney who chaired thecommission that recommended the pay raises, said this pay system wasintended by Congress and will have little impact on the giantfederal deficit.   But Cutler added, ``You may have a point that if they don't workthey shouldn't receive more than retired judges. I hadn't thoughtabout that before.''   Monroe Freedman, a legal ethics professor at Hofstra University,said, ``It doesn't look good when judges appear to be takingadvantage of the law. But it may well be too much to ask of peoplewho consider themselves having been underpaid for so long to pass up(senior status).''   Another legal ethics professor, Stephen Gillers of New YorkUniversity, said he saw no ethical problem for the non-workingsenior judges but ``it may be the statute should be changed. It maybe unwise or bad management. It's a question whether the public isgetting its money's worth.''   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to open jobsfor younger appointees by luring older judges out of the lifetimeappointments the Constitution grants them.   Congress counted on the senior judges to help with risingworkloads, and in large measure they have.   As a group, senior judges handle between 10 and 15 percent of allfederal cases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without(their) help,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge fromPortland, Maine.   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differdramatically.   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his lastjudicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 ayear less than he stands to begin receiving next month.   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status andnot resignation, Noel said: ``It was just a matter of choice.''   Noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his ``extensiveinvestments.'' Asked about his impending pay raise, Noel told AP,``I was expecting it.''   Owen Cox, a federal trial judge in Texas since 1970, took seniorstatus in 1981 and did substantial judicial work until his healthfailed.   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-supportsystem,'' court clerk Jesse Clark said.   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resignedhis salary would have been frozen at $67,100.</TEXT></DOC>
