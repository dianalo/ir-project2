But there was Fay Weldon at the West Side YMCA Center for the Arts the other night telling a gathering of fans and followers that men complained, probably accurately, that she did not write convincing male characters. &quot;I can invent women and I tend to describe men,&quot; she reported to a questioner. &quot;I don't feel at liberty to invent men.&quot;    Still, it is just the sort of personal insight you might expect from this staunchly independent woman who, at various times, has stood at the center of modern feminism or on the outskirts, a few yards ahead of the crowd. The confession was offered cheerfully. In fact, Ms. Weldon seems to sail through life in a state of perpetual amusement. Almost everything she has to say is, like her prose, sheathed in irony, and more often than not, the delivery is punctuated by a convulsion of laughter. She is an ample woman, somewhere in her 50s, with a direct, benign blue-eyed gaze. In matters of dress, she appears to favor peacock colors; at the YMCA reading, she glittered from the podium in a gold thread tunic.    Sitting down to a talk the day after, Ms. Weldon recalled that she sometimes has been quite sharp about fashionable phases of the women's movement. Then she rocked with helpless laughter at a memory: &quot;I said once, when women were busy 'saving their lives,' that if some women were men they would be rapists, too.&quot; Her relationship with feminism, she added, remains &quot;ongoing but troubled.&quot;    Ms. Weldon was here from England to promote her latest novel, the 12th in 21 years. Like all her fiction, &quot;The Hearts and Lives of Men&quot; (Viking, 357 pages, $18.95) is a serious comedy, and, despite the title, mostly about the business of being female. What is especially unusual about this piece of work is that it was written as a serial for a London weekly, Woman. The editors asked her agent, Giles Gordon, about getting a Weldon story: &quot;And he, being an agent, said 'Why not one every week?'&quot;    &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I've never lacked nerve. I think I thought on the whole it would keep me invisible because it was just a serial in a woman's magazine that nobody I knew read.&quot; The venture lasted for 48 weeks of 1986, and it was frantic, fun and educational. Among other things, Ms. Weldon came to understand the technical underpinnings of serialized novels of the Victorian age.    &quot;Because you don't know how long it's going to go on, you have to start it in the past and bring it up to the present. Starting in the past means you must have a child who will grow with the book. And you then realize that is why Dickens novels are the way they are and have children in them. They were written exactly the same way.&quot;    Ms. Weldon came up with a larky faux-Victorian tale, a modern fable of love, its failures and its survival. As she has done in other novels, she addresses the audience directly as &quot;reader&quot; and regularly offers aphorisms for our times: &quot;Well, love can't heal everything, can it. Sometimes I see it just as a kind of ointment, which people apply to their wounded egos.&quot;    &quot;Hearts and Lives&quot; has a smart, ruthless and charming hero, Clifford, a mover and shaker in the art world; a soft, passive heroine, Helen; and their spunky child, Nell, who is spirited away and survives all kinds of improbable but interesting adventures before she is reunited with her family.    One of the pleasures of a Weldon novel has always been Ms. Weldon's ability to deal with the female experience without doctrinaire rigidity. Still, what is surprisingly absent from the new book is the undercurrent of anger that has clearly fueled the wit of her other works. Feminine power has been a steady preoccupation of her recent fiction, but in this case it dwells rather gently in the passivity of a beautiful woman.    A couple of novels back she produced an astonishing little book, &quot;The Lives and Loves of a She-Devil,&quot; the saga of a homely, ungainly woman who, having lost her husband to a rich, talented, commanding beauty, transforms herself into the same sort of creature through grisly operations and rotten jobs.    &quot;Ah, but it's every woman looking in the mirror and seeing two selves,&quot; she says of &quot;She-Devil.&quot; &quot;One day you see this beauty and another this ugly thing. It works on all kinds of levels, that one. In a way it was about one woman and good and evil. And they switch. When the bad woman becomes good, she simply dies. when the good woman becomes bad, she lives. I guess that's what makes me angry.&quot;    For the time being, Ms. Weldon has moved on to new interests. Her next book, &quot;Leader of the Band,&quot; which will appear in England in June, features a female astronomer who runs off with a jazz musician on a tour of France. &quot;It's about nature and nurture,&quot; she reports. &quot;It's about, I suppose, free will.&quot; She has just begun another novel, similar in theme, focused on a character with a cloned twin. It was inspired by a newspaper story that said &quot;they could clone people but there was no call for it. I thought this is absurd; there are all kinds of people it would be useful to have many of.&quot;    Ms. Weldon fell into novel-writing through television after a master's degree in economics and a career in advertising. She began writing, she says, out of dissatisfaction with the unrecognizable fantasy females she had encountered in the fiction of men. Awaiting the arrival of a baby in the mid-60s, she wrote a TV script and then, unhappy with the performed version, turned it into her first book. &quot;The Fat Woman's Joke&quot; was published in 1967, a time when a lot of women were just beginning to talk about making changes in the social order. She had been, she would soon realize, a premature feminist.    She fell out of feminist favor in the late '70s with &quot;Puffball,&quot; a novel Ms. Weldon is very fond of, which was written after the birth of her fourth and last son. &quot;It was about a woman's relationship to her body, actually, and to babies and the whole sense of destiny somehow revolving around your hormones. But it was a time when women were not creatures who had babies. Then the times changed and it became all earth mother and fulfillment and lesbian mothers having babies and that sort of stuff.&quot;    Home for Ms. Weldon is a farm 120 miles from London where she lives with her husband, their two youngest sons and a variety of barnyard animals. A couple of days a week are spent in the city. There, she owns a house that has a full panoply of accessories necessary to a prolific novelist whose work is translated into most Western languages: a secretary, a word processor, a fax machine. The first draft of everything is written by hand on a note pad with a felt pen, usually in the train to or from London. She also has solid old-fashioned notions that good fiction can change lives. But then she gets a good deal of mail from women thanking her for changing theirs. &quot;And terrifying it is,&quot; she says dryly.    ---   Ms. Dudar writes frequently about writers and publishing. </TEXT></DOC>
