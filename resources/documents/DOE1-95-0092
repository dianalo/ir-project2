Two recombinant inbred familieshave been constructed from F{sub 2} populations of T232 x CM37 and CO159x Tx303. A genetic map based largely on isozymes and restriction fragmentlength polymorphisms has been produced that covers virtually the entiremaize genome. In order to map a new gene, an investigator has only todetermine its allelic distribution among the recombinant inbred linesand then compare it by computer with the distributions of all previouslymapped loci. The availability of the recombinant inbreds and the associateddata base constitute an efficient means of mapping new molecular markersin maize.</TEXT></DOC>
