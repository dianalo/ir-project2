That may be a blessing or a curse.</LP><TEXT>   Since June 1, such well-known international names asVolkswagen, Nestle and West Germany's Deutsche Bank havebegun popping up on the computer screens of dealers using theOTC Bulletin Board. Just one week old, the electronic systemallows eligible dealers to indicate twice daily the pricesthey're willing to pay for hundreds of foreign securities,previously quoted once a day in the Pink Sheets.   Traders say the new system, while it has its &quot;bugs,&quot;promises to make it easier and more efficient to tradeinternational stocks. But one regulator who is keeping aclose eye on international securities says let the investorbeware.   &quot;At this point, I would suggest it's premature forindividual investors who aren't sophisticated to developsignificant portfolios in foreign issues that aren't tradedon the New York exchange, the American exchange and Nasdaq,&quot;says Walter White, Wisconsin's Commissioner of Securities andhead of a group of state securities regulators that monitorsinternational stocks.   &quot;We're coming out of a period where we have just witnessedsubstantial abuses and losses of individuals' money in thesavings and loan scandal,&quot; Mr. White notes. &quot;We run the riskof similar catastrophes if Americans, without firmlyunderstanding their risks, get involved in overseasinvestments.&quot;   The first week brought a fast start for the OTC BulletinBoard, which is meant to shed new light on the murky world ofthe low-priced Pink Sheets stocks. More than 100 dealers --twice the number expected -- used the system in its firstweek to advertise prices or interest for about 3,000 U.S. andforeign securities, says the National Association ofSecurities Dealers.   More than two-thirds of price quotes for U.S. stocks werefirm, an &quot;astounding&quot; figure, says John T. Wall, executivevice president, marketing operations, for the NASD, theself-regulatory body for the OTC market. In other words,dealers stood ready to buy 100 shares or sell 100 shares attheir quoted prices. Other dealers just indicated possibleprices or gave phone numbers, much as they do in the PinkSheets.   Unlike Nasdaq or exchange-listed stocks, those flashedupon the Bulletin Board's 2,700 screens needn't meet minimumstandards for size, net worth or financial soundness. Andforeign Pink Sheets companies don't have to meet U.S.disclosure rules by making periodic, detailed financialreports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All theymust provide is the data they supply regulators in their homecountries.   The NASD's competitors aren't thrilled. Kenneth Leibler,president of the American Stock Exchange, says the BulletinBoard will give foreign stocks the legitimacy of Nasdaq eventhough they don't meet Nasdaq's standards. Not only does thissituation pose risks for small investors, he says, but it'sunfair to the exchanges which, like Nasdaq, can trade onlyforeign securities that meet U.S. disclosure rules.   In a compromise proposed by the NASD and accepted by theSEC, prices of foreign stocks are updated only twice a day,between 9 and 9:30 a.m. EDT and between 12 and 12:30 p.m.EDT. The prices aren't firm, only indicated. Traders muststill call one another to get current prices. Even so, theAmex's Mr. Leibler contends the new system will provide &quot;alevel of stature and visibility that exceeds what should beallowed for unregistered foreign securities.&quot;   On the plus side, the Bulletin Board will make it tougherfor brokers to give investors widely varying quotes forforeign stocks, says Thomas McIntyre, vice president of the$30-million Dessauer Asset Management portfolio ofinternational stocks, Orleans, Mass.   &quot;Anything that makes it easier for investors to trackthese things and punch up a quote and feel like it's arepresentative quote will be better,&quot; he says. &quot;It removes{the trading of foreign issues} out of the black box categoryand puts it onto the screen category.&quot;   One of the biggest U.S.-based traders of foreign stocksagrees. &quot;It helps our client base see the markets,&quot; saysMichael Dritz, president and chief executive officer of SmithNew Court, Carl Marks Inc., whose clients include hundreds ofregional and other market makers and large institutions. Hesays that in the first week, Smith New Court indicated priceson the Bulletin Board in about 80 of the 300 foreign issuesit routinely trades. Those included Nestle, Volkswagen,Deutsche Bank, Britain's Racal Electronics, Hongkong andamp;Shanghai Banking and Canada's Hemlo Gold Mines.   There are some &quot;bugs&quot; in the system, he says: Many clientsstill don't understand that prices aren't up-to-the minute.The first half-hour of the morning, already busy with theopening of the U.S. markets, allows scant time to updateprices. But Smith New Court expects to keep adding morequotes to the system.   Investors still face a battle to determine the soundnessof foreign OTC companies that don't meet U.S. disclosurerules. The information on file in home countries can be slim.&quot;There's tremendous resistance in Europe&quot; to higherdisclosure standards, Wisconsin's Mr. White says. He addsthat insider trading and market manipulation are common insome Asian markets. Differences in foreign accountingpractices, difficulties in currency translations and clearingcosts can add up to more headaches, Mr. White says.   Furthermore, many of the more than 1,700 foreign issuesnow listed on the Pink Sheets are obscure and rarely traded.&quot;If a stock is trading infrequently, you're stuck with it,&quot;he says. &quot;You certainly won't have the ability to get in andout at a reasonable price.&quot;   Nonetheless, the NASD's Mr. Wall says he's convinced theOTC Bulletin Board is providing investors in foreignsecurities with more, not less, protection. &quot;This marketexisted before June 1,&quot; he notes. &quot;We're just providing moreinformation, and we think that provides an additionalregulatory apparatus.&quot; At least now the regulators can keep acloser eye on trading of the securities.                                                                                                          COLORADO REFORMS: Gov. Roy Romer signed a bill Fridaydesigned to crack down on securities violations in Colorado,which regulators say has been a haven for penny-stock fraud.The new legislation requires all offerings to be registeredwith the state; establishes licensing requirements for allbroker-dealers and sales agents and beefs up stateenforcement powers. It also requires all funds raised in&quot;blank check`&quot; offerings to remain in escrow until a businessplan is adopted and the state securities commissioner isnotified. Colorado Securities Commissioner Philip Feiginsaid, &quot;A change was necessary to restore investor confidencein Colorado offerings.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The Nasdaq Composite Index of OTC stocks fell 3.22, or0.7%, to 460.87.
