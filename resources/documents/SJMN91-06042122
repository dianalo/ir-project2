This program is designed to reachpeople, especially kids and their families, in outlying areas.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ART MUSEUM PLANS TO TAKE SHOW ON ROAD  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Hilger said the Art Box was modeled after the San Diego Museum of Art'shighly successful million-dollar museum on wheels. But the inspiration couldjust as easily have been patterned on Hilger's own experiences with the ArtMuseum. The 10-year-old organization has been forced to move five times in thepast three years. A sixth move is scheduled next year when work to transformthe old county jail at Front and Cooper streets into the McPherson Center forArt and History is completed.;    Hilger said the inaugural Art Box tour willinclude an interactive exhibition designed to teach children about the basicelements of art, including lines, shapes, forms, colors, textures andcompositions. The Art Box will display works of art at children's eye level,and include hands-on activities to reinforce what is being taught.;    &quot;We'retrying to demystify art for kids from the very beginning,&quot; said PaulineHalajian, marketing coordinator for the Art Museum. &quot;We want to help childrento be comfortable with art, and understand how it's made.&quot;;    Halajian saidshe already has received phone calls from teachers interested in having themobile museum visit their classrooms. Because the exhibits can be changedreadily to meet the requirements of various audiences, the Art Box probablywill also go to senior centers and service clubs throughout the county.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; You can call the Art Museum at (408) 429-1964, or writeP.O.
