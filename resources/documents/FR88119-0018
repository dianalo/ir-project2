On February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3452), USEPA proposedto disapprove Indiana's most recent general SO<T2>2</T2> regulation, 325 Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) 7-1, whichhad been submitted on October 6, 1980. For 77 counties, USEPA proposeddisapproval solely because the rule contained a 30-day fuel averaging compliancemethodology which could be used to refute evidence of non-compliance througha stack test. On October 21, 1987, Indiana submitted as a revision to itsSO<T2>2</T2> plan a revised compliance methodology, 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, ReportingRequirements and Methods to Determine Compliance, which establishes stacktesting as an independently enforceable test method. While the State wasadopting this revised rule, USEPA used its parallel processing proceduresto approve the revised compliance methodology (52 FR 27016, July 17, 1987).The revised compliance methodology was promulgated by the State on September24, 1987, and submitted to USEPA on October 21, 1987. Today, USEPA is approvingnew compliance methodology 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 (1987), is reinstating the othergeneral requirements of 325 IAC 7-1 (1980), and, thus, is reinstating itsapproval of an SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for 77 of the 92 Indiana counties.

Background</ITAG>On March 12, 1982 (47 FR 10813) and May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20583), USEPA approvedor conditionally approved Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> SIP for most areas of the State. In these rulemakings, USEPAtook no action on one of three compliance methods contained in Indiana's1980 SO<T2>2</T2> regulation (325 IAC 7-1), i.e., the method which is based ondetermining the 30-day average of the sulfur content of the fuel.On May 11, 1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit setaside USEPA's March 12, 1982, approval of the SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits in Indiana's revised plan, solely because USEPAdid not rulemake on the 30-day averaging compliance method contained inthe rule. See <T3>Indiana andamp; Michigan Electric Company (IMEC) v. USEPA, </T3>733 F.2d489. As a consequence of this decision and another recent decision, <T3>Sierra Club v. Indiana-Kentucky Electric Company, </T3>716 F.2d 1145(7th Cir. 1983), there are no federally enforceable SO<T2>2</T2> emission limits regulating existing sources in Indiana.On February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3452), USEPA published a notice of proposedrulemaking on the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> plan. That notice proposed to disapprove Indiana's overall SO<T2>2</T2> plan, because the 30-day averaging compliance methodology inthe rule (325 IAC 7-1-3) was inconsistent with protection of the 3-hourand 24-hour SO<T2>2</T2> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS); and the stacktest methdology, which is consistent with short-term emission limits, wasnot independently enforceable. For 77 \1\<NOTE/> of Indiana's 92 counties, this was the only basis for theproposed disapproval of Indiana's SO<T2>2</T2> plan. For the remaining 15 counties,\2\<NOTE/> technical deficiencies were noted as well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These 77 counties are: Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton,Blackford, Boone, Brown, Carroll, Cass, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Crawford,Daviess, Decatur, Dekalb, Delaware, Dubois, Elkhart, Fayette, Fountain,Franklin, Fulton, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Harrison, Hendricks,Henry, Howard, Huntington, Jackson, Jasper, Jay, Jennings, Johnson, Knox,Kosciusko, Lagrange, Lawrence, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Miami, Monroe,Montgomery, Newton, Noble, Ohio, Orange, Owen, Parke, Perry, Pike, Pulaski,Putnam, Randolph, Ripley, Rush, St. Joseph, Scott, Shelby, Spencer, Starke,Steuben, Switzerland, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Union, Vanderburgh, Wabash, Warren,Washington, Wells, White, and Whitley.

The revised rule includesa stack test compliance method and either a 30-day or a calendar month(depending upon the size of the source) averaging fuel analysis method,\5\<NOTE/> each of which may be used at any time to determine complianceor non-compliance with source emission limitations. However, a determinationof non-compliance through the use of one method cannot be refuted by evidenceof compliance through the other method.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The generic procedures for ``parallel processing'' aredescribed at 47 FR 27073 (June 23, 1982). The State and USEPA propose rulemakingat roughly the same time, announce concurrent comment periods, and jointlyreview public comments. The State and USEPA then coordinate resolutionof any deficiencies prior to the State's final adoption of the rule. Ifthe State's rule, as finally adopted, is substantially identical to theproposed rule, then USEPA will take final action on the rule shortly followingits submittal to USEPA. On the other hand, if the final rule is substantiallydifferent than the proposed rule, then USEPA may publish a rulemaking noticereproposing action as necessary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ For the exact language of 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, see 52 FR 27017(July 17, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Although the rule contains a possible 30-day averagingcompliance methodology for certain sources and monthly averaging for others,for the purposes of this notice, this combination of methodologies willbe referred to as 30-day averaging.In accordance with the February 4, 1987, proposed rulemaking notice, onJuly 17, 1987 (52 FR 27016), USEPA; (1) Proposed (under parallel processing)to approve 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, because it provides for the independent useof stack testing to determine compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> emission in 325 IAC 7-1 and (2) proposed to reinstate most ofIndiana's other SO<T2>2</T2> provisions (i.e., 325 IAC 7-1-1, 2 (except for any emissionlimits in the 15 counties), 4, 5, 6, and 7. Based on these, it also proposedto reinstate its approval of Indiana's plan for the 77 counties, becausean approvable compliance methodology was the only deficiency in the planfor these 77 counties.On October 21, 1987, Indiana submitted 325 IAC 7-1-1.3, as adopted by theIndiana Air Pollution Control Board (Board) on July 1, 1987, and promulgatedby the State on September 24, 1987. USEPA has determined that the versionof the rule most recently submitted is identical to the preliminarily adopted325 IAC 7-1-3.1. Therefore, based on USEPA's analysis of the rule and reviewof comments received in response to USEPA's proposals, USEPA approves thisrule for inclusion into the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP. Its inclusion resolves the past deficiencies in the short-termcompliance methodology for SO<T2>2</T2> sources in Indiana by including stack testing as an independentmeans of determining compliance or non-compliance. In addition, USEPA reinstatesthe other general provisions of 325 IAC 7-1 (1980), i.e., 325 IAC 7-1-1,2 (except for any emission limits in the 15 counties), 4, 5, 6, and 7.Thus, USEPA is reinstating its approval of the SO<T2>2</T2> plan for the 77 counties, because the State has submitted anapprovable compliance methodology, and this resolves the only deficiencycited by USEPA in its February 4, 1987, proposed disapproval of the planfor these counties.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ All SO<T2>2</T2> plans must be consistent with USEPA's Stack Height Regulations,which implement the stack height provisions of section 123 of the Act (July8, 1985, 50 FR 27892). USEPA's stack height regulations apply to stacks(and sources) which came into existence and dispersion techniques implementedon or after December 31, 1970. Stack height credit for the purpose of establishingan emission limitation is restricted to good engineering practice (GEP),i.e., the greater for 213 feet or the GEP formula height. Credit for dispersiontechniques, i.e., merged stacks, is generally prohibited, with a few exceptions,e.g., total plantwide allowable SO<T2>2</T2> emissions do not exceed 5000 tons per year and the stack wasoriginally designed and constructed with merged gas streams.<ITAG tagnum="28">Indiana has certified that its emission limit for all sources withinthe 77 counties are not affected by stack height credit in excess of GEPor any other dispersion technique.

Comments on the February 4, 1987, and July 17, 1987, ProposedRulemaking Notices Which Are Applicable to Today's Rulemaking; USEPA'sResponses</ITAG>The following summarizes the applicable public comments received by USEPAin response to its proposed rulemaking notices of February 4, 1987, andJuly 17, 1987. Only those comments on the February 4, 1987, proposal whichconcerned the compliance methodology aspect of the State's SO<T2>2</T2> plan are included here. Comments on the other aspects of theSO<T2>2</T2> plan, including county-specific deficiencies for the remaining15 counties, will be addressed where appropriate in future rulemaking actions.February 4, 1987, Comments and Responses<T3>Comment:</T3> The Indiana Coal Council (ICC), Public Service Indiana(PSI), the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) and Peabody Holding Company(Peabody) claimed that 30-day averaging is a valid method of demonstratingcompliance.In support of this claim, the commentors stated that:(1) Statewide SO<T2>2</T2> emission reductions have been achieved and no monitored violationsof the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS have been recorded since compliance has been determinedon a 30-day averaging basis;(2) USEPA has not demonstrated that a 30-day average will not protect the3-hour and 24-hour NAAQS;(3) USEPA has failed to adequately address sulfur variability in fuelsas it claimed it would in past <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices;(4) USEPA recently stated that it has made no generic determination aboutlong-term compliance averaging; and(5) the Seventh Circuit did not disapprove the use of 30-day averagingin its May 11, 1984, <T3>IMEC</T3> decision.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA notes that Indiana has replaced its previous compliancemethodology, in which compliance with an emission limit on a 30-day averagedbasis could refute a violation determined by a stack test, with a compliancemethodology where each method, i.e., stack test and 30-day/monthly averaging,is independently enforceable. Therefore, portions of these comments areno longer relevant.Moreover, Indiana did not and has never demonstrated that its emissionlimits averaged over 30 days protect the 3-hour and 24-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS.\7\<NOTE/> Under the Clean Air Act, it is the responsibility of a Statesubmitting a 30-day averaged compliance method to show that that method,in combination with its emission limits, would protect the NAAQS. Therefore,USEPA cannot approve Indiana's emission limits as being adequate to protectthe 3-hour and 24-hour NAAQS, when compliance is determined using the 30-dayaveraged compliance methodology as contained in Indiana's former rule 325IAC 7-1-3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The primary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when, in a calendar year, either: (1) Theannual arithmetic mean value of SO<T2>2</T2> concentration exceeds 80 micrograms per cubic meter of air (80ug/m3) (the annual primary standard), or (2) the maximum 24-hour concentrationof SO<T2>2</T2> at any site exceeds 365 ug/m3 more than once (the 24-hour primarystandard). The secondary SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS is violated when the maximum 3-hour concentration at anysite exceeds 1,300 ug/m3 more than once.USEPA acknowledges that it is continuing to review the acceptability oflong-term averaging and sulfur variability in fuels. Until that reviewis complete, USEPA must rule on all SO<T2>2</T2> SIPs submitted in relationship to the present SO<T2>2</T2> policies. Therefore, it cannot approve the 30-day averagingcompliance methodology, because Indiana has not demonstrated that thiscompliance methodology assures the attainment and maintenance of the presentshort-term SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS.As to the ambient monitoring data, USEPA generally does not accept monitoringdata as the sole basis for an attainment demonstration. (See the Arizonacopper smelter comment below.) This is because modeling normally is theonly feasible method capable of determining the highest concentrationsthat will occur under a wide range of meteorological conditions with agiven set of emission parameters. Also, due to actual stack heights orconfigurations which do not conform with USEPA's July 8, 1985, stack heightregulations, ambient monitoring data cannot be used to assure creditableattainment under these circumstances. Finally, contrary to the commentors'assertion, Indiana sources have contributed to monitored exceedances inrecent years. Therefore, USEPA is not convinced that the ambient SO<T2>2</T2> data support the use of long-term averaging.USEPA agrees that the Court in its <T3>IMEC</T3> decision did not disapprove the use of 30-day averaging nordid it preclude USEPA from approving 30-day averaging. However, it didset aside USEPA's approval of emission limits in Indiana's plan until USEPArule made on this methodology. USEPA's February 4, 1987, proposed disapprovalof that methodology and July 17, 1987, proposed approval of the revisedmethodology were directly responsive to the Court's mandate.<T3>Comment: </T3>ALCOA, PSI and Peabody disagreed with USEPA that dailyexceedances of the emission limitation will cause actual exceedances ofthe NAAQS, given the conservativeness in the process used to set emissionlimitations. PSI claimed that the probability of the joint occurrence ofworst-case meteorology, worst-case operating levels, and an emission limitationexceedance is ``infinitestimally'' small. PSI also asserted that USEPA'sstated accuracy for its models (i.e., within a factor of two) is neitherconclusive nor supportive of USEPA's ``deterministic'' application of thesemodels. The commentor maintained that the only deterministic measurementof air quality is actual monitoring data.<T3>Response: </T3>These comments concern the validity of USEPA's modelingguidelines and procedures \8\<NOTE/> which are not the subject of today's rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ USEPA's modeling guidance is found in ``Guideline on AirQuality Models.''<T3>Comment: </T3>To support its claim that a 30-day average will protectthe short-term SO<T2>2 </T2>NAAQS, PSI submitted a copy of two analyses performed by a consultant;one used concurrent actual emission rates, in pounds per million BritishThermal Unit (lbs/MMBTU), actual operating rates and meteorology for a5-year period, and the other used maximum operating rates, actual lbs/MMBTUlevels, and meteorology for a 5-year period. These analyses showed attainmentof the short-term NAAQS, despite many days with lbs/MMBTU values abovethe 30-day average emission limit. PSI and ALCOA urged USEPA to approvethe use of this approach as a means of supporting 30-day averaging compliancestrategies.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA does not accept the proposed modeling approachesand the specific analyses as demonstrating that a 30-day averaged emissionlimit will protect the 3-hour and 24-hour NAAQS. USEPA modeling guidelinesspecify that the modeled emission rates must represent maximum worst-caseoperating load and maximum allowable emission limitations. PSI's use ofactual operating rates and/or actual lbs/MMBTU values is not consistentwith this guidance. Furthermore, the assumed dependence between emissionsand meteorology (e.g., operating rates and/or lbs/MMBTU value for Day 1were only modeled with meteorology for Day 1, etc.) is without any basis.Thus, USEPA must reject PSI's proposed modeling approach for addressinga long-term emission average.<T3>Comment: </T3>PSI stated that USEPA's approval of the Arizona SO<T2>2 </T2>SIP for copper smelters established a precedent for using astatistical attainment demonstration for SO<T2>2.</T2><T3>Response: </T3>As noted in a letter from J. Craig Potter, AssistantAdministrator for Air and Radiation, USEPA, to Nancy A. Maloley, Commissioner,Indiana Department of Environmental Management (DEM), dated May 22, 1986,the multipoint rollback statistical approach approved for the Arizona smelterswas approved as a ``result of a wide range of factors stemming from thevery unusual nature of the smelter emission problems.'' Mr. Potter citedthe particularly difficult problems of smelters (e.g., extreme variationsof emissions, presence of fugitive emissions, complex terrain), Congress'own special treatment of smelters in section 119 of the Clean Air Act (Act),and the SIP requirements for additional monitoring, commitment to studycontrol levels, and continuous compliance methodology.USEPA views the smelter SO<T2>2 </T2>issue as being fundamentally different than the Indiana SO<T2>2 </T2>issue, because Indiana SO<T2>2 </T2>emissions are produced largely by utility power plants and largeindustrial boilers. USEPA will continue to rely on its existing air qualitymodeling methods to establish emission limits for such sources.<T3>Comment: </T3>ICC, DEM, PSI and Peabody noted that Indiana is in theprocess of developing a revised compliance test method rule. Based on thisrevised rule, the ICC and DEM urged USEPA to approve the SIP for the 77counties identified in the February 4, 1987, notice without further reproposal.Peabody urged approval of the entire SIP without further reproposal.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA's July 17, 1987, supplemental rulemaking noticeproposed to approve 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 and the emission limitations for 77of Indiana's 92 counties, as discussed earlier in this rulemaking notice.USEPA, today, is approving the SIP of these 77 counties and the generalprovisions of Indiana's SO<T2>2 </T2>rule for all counties. USEPA will act upon the emission limitsfor the remaining 15 counties in future rulemaking notices.<T3>Comment: </T3>ICC stated that withdrawal of 30-day averaging wouldadversely impact the Indiana coal industry.<T3>Response: </T3>USEPA's proposed disapproval of Indiana's plan, includingthe 30-day averaging provisions of 325 IAC 7-1-3, was based on the criteriaestablished by Section 110 of the Act. These criteria do not include considerationof economic impacts caused by control measures necessary to assure attainmentand maintenance of the NAAQS. (See <T3>Union Electric Co. v. USEPA, </T3>427 U.S. 246 (1976).) The State,however, may consider such effects in the development of its SIP.<T3>Comment: </T3>Peabody cited the existence of a 30-day enforcement policyin Ohio. The commentor stated that a similar policy should be establishedin Indiana also.<T3>Response: </T3>The 30-day enforcement policy for Ohio did not modifythe SIP; it merely established a procedure for prioritizing enforcementcases. Compliance on a short-term and continuous basis is still necessaryto ensure attainment of the 3-hour and 24-hour NAAQS. As recognized bythe commentor, such a policy is an enforcement matter; not related to USEPA'sapproval of a SIP. Thus, discussion of such a 30-day enforcement policyfor Indiana is not appropriate in this rulemaking.July 17, 1987, Comments and Responses<T3>Comment: </T3>Peabody, DEM and ICC supported USEPA's proposed rulemaking.DEM noted that 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 was adopted by the Board in final on July1, 1987, and that this rule would be formally submitted to USEPA afterit was promulgated by Indiana in September. DEM also pointed out its progresscorrecting the technical deficiencies in the remaining 15 counties.<T3>Response:</T3> USEPA will rulemake on the county-specific provisionsfor each of these 15 counties in future rulemaking actions.<T3>Comment:</T3> The Hoosier Environmental Council (HEC) commented onthe State's revised compliance test method rule (325 IAC 7-1-3.1). Thecommentor believes that daily emission averages are preferable to a 30-dayaverage, supported by a stack test.<T3>Response:</T3> Although daily emission averaging may protect the 24-hourand annual SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS, it intrinsically can not protect the 3-hour SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS; whereas, as discussed below, stack testing is consistentwith protection of the 3-hour standard. Moreover, although USEPA recognizesthe benefit of having emissions data for each and every day, it must beunderstood that USEPA is rulemaking on the State regulation before it;not developing a new regulation. To this end, USEPA accepts the State'sregulation, because it provides for an independent stack test, which willallow for protection of the 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual NAAQS. Any suggestionsfor alternative approaches should be directed to the State.<T3>Comment:</T3> Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE), Save the DunesCouncil (SDC) and HEC opposed USEPA's proposed rulemaking. CBE, SDC andHEC commented that 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 will not ensure compliance on a continuous,short-term basis.The commentors noted that the 30-day averaging method is deficient becauseit would result in violations of the short-term NAAQS, it lacks uniformanalytical and quality assurance measures, and it does not require theuse of the most up-to-date emission factors. CBE and SDC implied that stacktesting on a yearly basis would be acceptable. HEC rejected both stacktesting and 30-day averaging, and, as noted above, instead preferred dailyemissions data.<T3>Response:</T3> Rule 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 allows the State or USEPA to requirethe use of a stack test to determine compliance with a source's emissionlimit(s). The State's rule establishes 30-day averaging as an alternativecompliance methodology. As discussed above, violations of the short-termNAAQS could occur if emission limits are enforced on a 30-day averagedbasis. USEPA is approving Indiana's compliance plan as submitted becausestack testing is consistent with the short-term NAAQS \9\<NOTE/> and the rule provides that evidence of noncompliance developedwith one methodology, e.g., a stack test, cannot be refuted by evidencedeveloped with the other methodology.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ USEPA's preference for stack testing was noted most recentlyin a memorandum dated July 29, 1987, from Gerald Emison, Director, Officeof Air Quality Planning and Standards, USEPA, entitled ``State ImplementationPlans for Sulfur Dioxide.'' The memo states that USEPA is continuing toaccept a USEPA Reference Method 6 (40 CFR Part 60 Appendix A) stack testas an adequate SIP compliance test method for SO<T2>2</T2>. USEPA's policy specifies no required frequency for stack testing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Summary</ITAG>USEPA approves 325 IAC 7-1-3.1 as a revision to the Indiana SO<T2>2</T2> SIP, because it provides for an independent stack test compliancemethod for SO<T2>2</T2> sources in the State. Additionally, it reinstates its March12, 1982, final approval of the general provisions of 325 IAC 7-1, i.e.,325 IAC 7-1-1, 2 (with the exception of any emission limits for the 15counties), 4, 5, 6, and 7, and, thus, reinstates its approval of an SO<T2>2</T2> plan under section 110 of the Clean Air Act for the 77 counties.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this rule from therequirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by February 18, 1988. This action may not be challenged later inproceedings to enforce its requirements.
