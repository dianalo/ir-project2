It's the first commercial power plant that burns only cattlechips for fuel, although smaller facilities ``digest'' manure toproduce methane to generate electricity, said Will Parish, founderand president of National Energy Associates Inc.   Parish, 36, left his job with a San Francisco law firm to startthe Mill Valley company, which he said is dedicated to ``doing wellby doing good'' by building profitable but socially andenvironmentally responsible energy projects.   The $46 million, 17{-megawatt Mesquite Lake Resource RecoveryProject, financed by the bonds plus $9 million from investors, islocated next to its fuel supply: cattle feedlots near Imperial inthe desert about 110 miles east of San Diego. It fired up inNovember 1987 and began continuous on-line electricity productionlast October.   ``It truly is a unique plant,'' said Bill McCroskey, a projectdevelopment manager for Southern California Edison Co.   ``We are presently buying power from them (under a 30-yearcontract). The plant satisfactorily passed its operating test lastfall. They are considered a reliable energy source.''   The plant runs at 70 percent to 85 percent of its maximumcapacity as its construction company, Lurgi Corp. of Frankfurt, WestGermany, ``tweaks'' it toward full net capacity of 15 megawatts,enough to power 15,000 to 20,000 homes using 800 to 900 tons ofmanure daily, Parish said. The plant runs on the other 2{ megawattsit produces.   Parish said the plant's output represents annual savings of300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would be burned for power, andrelieves pressure on Imperial Valley landfills.   Until the entrepreneur came along, feedlot owners paid to havemanure carted away and dumped. It has little value as fertilizerbecause it contains too much salt and weed seeds. Now NEA buys thedung for $1 per ton from 15 feedlots.   ``I've been called a manure mogul,'' Parish joked. ``My almamater ... referred to me in the alumni notes as the class of 1975'sfirst `entremanure.'''   Loaders scoop up manure from some 250,000 cattle, and about 60trucks deliver it to the Mesquite Lake plant, where ``we stack itlike a precious commodity,'' Parish said.   Conveyor belts feed 40 tons of manure an hour into the plant,where it is dried and dropped into special furnaces. The heatproduces more than 150,000 pounds of steam hourly to drive a turbineand electric generator.   Because the power plant qualified as a waste recovery operation,the California Pollution Control Financing Authority issued $37.2million in bonds to help finance construction. NEA raised $9 millionmore by forming a limited partnership. Repayment of the 20-year,investment-grade bonds is guaranteed by National Westminster BankUSA.   ``We have seen a number of unusual proposals, and this is clearlyone of them,'' Keith Seegmiller, the financing authority's deputyexecutive secretary, said by phone from Sacramento.   Parish has called the plant ``a cash cow'' because ``manure costsa penny a kilowatt hour, and we sell electricity at 7 cents akilowatt hour. That translates on an annual basis to a fuel cost ofabout $2 million and gross sales of about $10 million, leaving $8million to cover (other) expenses and profits.''   While tax-free bonds are attractive, Parish said it wasn't alwayseasy soliciting partners to invest a minimum of $50,000 each.   ``I got questions like, `What will happen if the cattle getconstipated?''' Parish recalled.   The power plant yields about 160 tons of ash daily, but Parishexpects to be selling all of it by year's end as an additive topaving materials and fertilizer and an absorbent to soak up toxiccontaminants from geothermal energy wells.   NEA now is building a $60 million, 17-megawatt power plant nextto the manure plant. It will burn manure, wood waste and variousagricultural wastes.</TEXT></DOC>
