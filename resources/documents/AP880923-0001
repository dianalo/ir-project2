(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A strike by 1,200 Bay Area Rapid Transitdistrict mechanics, janitors and clerks begins early Monday, unionofficials said Thursday, threatening to cripple service for 204,000daily riders.   ``The leadership has selected Monday, ... 12:01 a.m. to commencea strike against the BART district. The pickets will go up at thattime,'' said Suzanne Angeli, vice president of Local 790 of theUnited Public Employees Union.   About 500 train operators and station agents represented by theAmalgamated Transit Union's Local 1555 will honor the picket lines,said ATU local leader Hank White.   Between them, the two unions represent nearly two-thirds of theemployees in the BART system, which carries about 204,000 ridersdayily in three San Francisco Bay area counties.   Immediately after Local 790's announcement, BART districtofficials began re-examining the union's demands and consideringhow to keep the system operating, BART spokesman Sy Mouber said.   ``We will of course begin making plans as to what level ofservice we can operate,'' Mouber said. ``A problem we're going tohave is certifying people who are going to be operating thetrains.''   The district also planned to meet with a mediator Fridaymorning, Mouber said, but no new talks were scheduled.   BART said earlier that if both unions went on strike, itsmanagers may be able to provide limited train service, as they didduring a 1979 strike.   Members of Local 790 rejected the public agency's contract offerWednesday night by a vote of 464-354.   The three-year pact calls for a 14 percent increase in pay andbenefits the first year and 3 percent for each of the next twoyears, with a one-time cost-of-living payment at the end.   Non-economic issues, including proposed changes in work rules,working conditions, safety issues and union rights are at thecenter of the dispute, Angeli said. Both unions have criticized theproposed retirement benefits.   Local 1555 approved the contract by six votes, 170-164, andBART's board of directors ratified that agreement on Thursday, butLocal 1555, after meeting with Local 790 late Thursday, reaffirmedits promise to honor picket lines.   BART General Manager Keith Bernard said it was ``absolute lunacyand very irresponsible to seek a strike,'' calling the proposedcontract ``one of the best in the industry today'' and noting thatBART faces a $4.8 million deficit in the current fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
