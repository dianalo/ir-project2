The posh community's lawmakers voted down language that would prohibit smoking in restaurants and most other public places, and proposed instead an ordinance allowing eating establishments to set aside one-third of the dining areas for smokers. Smoking areas, however, would have to be equipped with a charcoal-filtered ventilation system.    The five-member council will vote on the new plan May 21.    Bruce Abrams, the councilman who proposed the stricter measure but voted last week for the modification, said the city had faced considerable pressure from unhappy restaurateurs. &quot;There was an economic issue to this thing, too,&quot; he said.    As previously reported, Winston-Salem, N.C.-based RJR had said it might move the Nabisco Dinah Shore Ladies Professional Golf Association Tournament, held for the past 16 years in this Palm Springs-area town. Noting that the company is the nation's second-largest tobacco producer, the tournament's executive director had said the sponsor didn't &quot;want to be where we're not wanted.&quot; One critic of the smoking ban had claimed loss of the event could cost the city up to $13 million annually.    An RJR spokesman said that the revised ordinance proposal was &quot;a good compromise, and our decision is to stay.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
