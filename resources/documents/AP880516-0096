The significance of the report by C. Everett Koop is not that itunveils new scientific evidence, but that he organized existingresearch into a systematic presentation lumping nicotine withheroin and cocaine as physiologically addictive substances.   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettesand other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop wrote in apreface. ``An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine isthe drug in tobacco that causes addiction.   ``Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction aresimilar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroinand cocaine.''   Although his report places nicotine in essentially the samemedical category as those two illicit drugs, Koop noted at a newsconference that tobacco has a ``favored place'' in the UnitedStates and is not likely to be banned.   ``I don't think we are every going to get to a point in oursociety where we can bring about prohibition of tobacco,'' he said.``I don't think this would be a practical solution. I think welearned this during the prohibition on alcohol.''   He said steps should be taken to ``protect children'' from beingexposed to nicotine, noting that 43 states already have laws,albeit ``poorly enforced,'' against the sale of cigarettes tominors.   ``I think we need a license to sell tobacco just they way werequire one to sell alcohol,'' said Koop.   Asked later where he would set the age on banning sales to youngpeople, the surgeon general noted that different states setdifferent ages for such things as driving and buying alcohol andsaid that practice probably would continue with stricteranti-tobacco laws.   ``I would set it at about 75,'' added the 71-year-old physician.   Asked whether his new report might highten antagonism betweensmokers and nonsmokers, Koop said, ``That would be hard to predict.I think it would mean in general more sympathy for the person whocan't quit. That certainly is the position I've taken ever since Ihave been in this job. You might get annoyed at people who smoke inyour presense and make your eyes burn and your sinuses clog up andso forth, but your anger has to be abated by the fact that thesepeople are addicted to a drug and I think this will make peoplemore tolerant of the problems a smoker faces when he is trying toquit.''   The report says nicotine can be addictive no matter how itenters the body, noting that so-called smokeless tobacco enters theblood stream through absorbtion in the mouth and that pipe andcigar smokers who do not inhale subject themselves to the same kindof absorbtion.   The report cites 171 separate studies, most of them conductedduring the past decade, as references.   In a letter to Congress accompanying the report, Health andHuman Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said, ``A warning label onthe addicting nature of tobacco use should be rotated with otherhealth warnings now required on cigarette and smokeless tobaccopackages and advertisements.''   Bowen said cigarette smoking is ``the chief avoidable cause ofpremature death in this country,'' causing more than 300,000 suchdeaths each year.   ``The disease impact of smoking justifies placing the problem oftobacco use at the top of the public health agenda,'' Bowen wrote.``The conclusions of this report provide another compelling reasonfor strengthening our efforts to reduce tobacco use in oursociety.''   In his opening remarks, Koop also called for an addictionwarning on cigarette labels and advertising and said, ``Treatmentof tobacco addiction should be more widely available and should beconsidered at least as favorably by third-party payers as treatmentof alcoholism and illicit drug addiction.''   Koop handled some other controversial ideas as questions:   ``With the evidence that tobacco is addicting, is it appropriatefor tobacco products to be sold through vending machines, which areeasily accessible to children?   ``Is it appropriate for free samples of tobacco products to besent through the mail or distributed on public property, whereverification of age is difficult if not impossible? Should the saleof tobacco be treated less seriously than the sale of alcoholicbeverages, for which a specific license is required (and revokedfor repeated sales to minors)?   ``In the face of overwhelming evidence that tobacco isaddicting, policy-makers should address these questions withoutdelay,'' Koop said.   Reaction was swift and predictable.   ``This report and the surgeon general's findings should compelfederal and state authorities to treat tobacco as the addictivvedrug that it is,'' said Dr. Alan R. Nelson, chairman of the boardof trustees of the American Medical Association.   Nelson said federal and state authorities should raise the ageof those allowed to purchase cigarettes to 21, ban the access oftobacco products through vending machines, label tobacco productsas addictive, ban the advertising of tobacco products and regulatethe development of new nicotine products.   Although details of the report were not made public until today,one of the many federal health officials that helped prepare itdisclosed the essential finding _ that nicotine is addictive _ in atelevision interview earlier this month.   A Tobacco Institute spokesman, Walker Merryman, reacted to thatdisclosure by Ronald M. Davis, director of the federal Office ofSmoking and Health, by saying it showed ``anti-tobacco zeal hasovertaken common sense and good judgment.''   In a statement today, the Tobacco Institute said ``Smoking istruly a personal choice which can be stopped if and when a persondecides to do so. The surgeon general's own Public Health Servicefigures indicate that about 40 million Americans are former smokersand that 95 percent of them quit smoking without help. Thesefigures, and common sense, contradict any claim that smoking is an`addiction'.''   The institute said the report ``trivializes the serious drugproblem faced by society. The claim that cigarette smoking is adrug addiction similar to cocaine or heroin use, or alcohol abuse,is unfortunate and unwarranted. The message to the American publicis that using illegal drugs, such as crack or heroin, has the samerisk of addiction as smoking.''   Koop's last smoking report concluded _ again based on acompilation of existing studies _ that nonsmokers' health wasendangered by inhaling smoke from other people's cigarettes.   Issued just over a year ago, that report has reverberatedquickly throughout society, providing impetus for a growing movetoward smoke-free environments in the workplace, restaurants andpublic buildings.
