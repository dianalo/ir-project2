The transaction represents the sale of a second major asset in less than a week by financially troubled Ocelot. As previously reported, it said last week that it would sell, for as much as 370 million dollars, almost all of its Alberta oil and gas producing properties to a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., the Toronto-based subsidiary of Exxon Corp.    Ocelot said some funds from both transactions will be used to reduce its 770 million dollars of debt. The company said it will continue to explore for and develop natural gas in western Canada. It also operates two petrochemical plants in British Columbia and a group of oil and gas service and supply companies.    Bow Valley, 33%-owned by British Gas PLC of London, said the Saskatchewan natural gas field is on a 220,000-acre block near the Alberta border. It said that proved reserves are almost 500 billion cubic feet of gas, and production currently is about 120 million cubic feet daily, of which Ocelot's share is more than 110 million cubic feet daily. The transaction also includes production and gas-transmission facilities.    Ocelot said that definitive purchase agreements with Bow Valley and the Imperial Oil unit are expected to be completed soon. The transactions are subject to regulatory clearance and to other approvals. </TEXT></DOC>
