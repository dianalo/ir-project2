Changes in design and operation were made and further data obtainedas a result of studies of the following parameters: pretreatment withsulfuric acid, operating pressure, presence or absence of CO, and natureof feedstock. The major study has centered around the design, constructionand testing of a small-scale continuous reactor whose operation was basedupon the use of a newly designed screw unit to compress and deliver thewood meal to the reactor site. Several successful runs were made usingthis reactor for periods up to six hours duration. The product oil wassimilar to that obtained previously using the semi-continuous reactor.Chemical studies on oils obtained from both wood and cellulose (batchprocess) have been continued. A significant difference was noted betweenoils obtained from batch and continuous processes which are believeddue to marked differences in reaction times at elevated temperatures.Some suggestions regarding the mechanism of formation of the chemicalproducts are made. Studies have been initiated to upgrade the wood oilto produce a higher quality gasoline-like fuel. These have involved thepreparation and use of substantial quantities of the zeolite catalystHZSM-5. Significant yields of C/sub 6/-C/sub 10/ aromatic hydrocarbons(gasoline range) have been obtained in preliminary runs in batch reactors.A suitable pump has been designed and constructed to perform packed bedexperiments on contacting proto-oil with HZSM-5. 7 refs., 4 figs., 5tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
