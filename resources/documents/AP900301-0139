(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $500 million spy satellite glidedfrom the space shuttle on Thursday and Atlantis' astronautsstreaked toward a Sunday landing, NASA sources said.   The sources said the 37,300-pound satellite was ejected from theshuttle's cargo bay early Thursday.   Atlantis will land at 1:34 p.m. EST Sunday at Edwards Air ForceBase in California, said the sources, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The shuttle was launched in darkness early Wednesday andprogress of the mission has been cloaked under a Pentagon-imposednews blackout.   A brief announcement Thursday by the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration said Atlantis' ``expected landing day'' wasSunday at Edwards, but the agency did not announce a time ormention the satellite.   About the shuttle and its five-member, all-military crew, thestatement said: ``The crew is doing well and orbiter Atlantiscontinues to perform satisfactorily.''   The shuttle's solid rocket boosters arrived around middayThursday at a NASA hangar at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Stationfor several days of assessment, said NASA spokesman BruceBuckingham. The boosters separated two minutes and eight secondsafter liftoff and fell into the Atlantic 169 miles from KennedySpace Center. They were retrieved by two ships and towed back.   According to sources, the satellite carried by Atlantis is apowerful space snoop capable of taking high resolution photographsfrom orbit and evaesdropping on electronic communications aroundthe world.   The satellite, the sources said, was placed into a highinclination orbit that will fly over much of the Soviet Union,including portions in the north not previously observed by ashuttle-launched satellite.   By covering most of the Soviet Union, the satellite may play arole in verifying Soviet compliance with arms agreements.   Atlantis' is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. Theother crew members are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot,and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air ForceCol. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.   Atlantis' flight is the 34th shuttle mission and the sixthdedicated solely to the military.</TEXT></DOC>
