The authority to offer the three-engine plane was grantedFriday by McDonnell Douglas's board of directors. To launchthe line, the company must now obtain a sufficient number oforders. McDonnell Douglas said a launch of the MD-12, aderivative of its MD-11 tri-jet, is expected in 1992.</LP><TEXT>   But first, the heavily indebted St. Louis concern mustfind a way to fund the $4 billion project. The board'sapproval is merely &quot;the first step in a rigorous process&quot; toget the MD-12 off the ground, Chairman John McDonnell toldemployees in a letter.   Since McDonnell Douglas officials disclosed last springthat they might be inclined to bring an equity partner intothe company's commercial aircraft operations, they have beenholding discussions with a number of potential investors,mainly in Asia.   Among the options is for manufacturers in these countriesto become major, risk-sharing subcontractors on the MD-12.This conceivably would provide McDonnell Douglas with lowproduction costs, as well as improved access to the covetedPacific Rim market.   In fact, if the company manages to pull off a lucrativeenough deal, it would take a big step toward guaranteeingthat it remains a force in the highly competitive jetlinerindustry for years to come. Some aerospace analysts,including PaineWebber Inc.'s Jack Modzelewski, havequestioned if McDonnell Douglas would be able to survive forlong against Boeing and Airbus Industrie. The Europeanconsortium has managed in recent years to siphon market sharefrom McDonnell Douglas.   But introduction of the MD-12 would, in Mr. McDonnell'swords, add &quot;muscle to our competitiveness in a tough market.&quot;The plane would be delivered beginning in 1997.   In particular, the MD-12 takes aim at the 747, Boeing'smost profitable product. McDonnell Douglas marketers make thecase that the MD-12, with an ability to carry 375 passengers8,000 nautical miles, will be snapped up by airlines eager toexpand their route structures.   &quot;At ranges beyond 7,000 miles, the 747 loses itscapability very, very quickly,&quot; John Wolf, McDonnellDouglas's executive vice president for commercial programs,asserted. Among the flights that the MD-12 will be able tomake non-stop, he said, are Dallas to Tokyo, Dallas to Seoul,South Korea, and Singapore to Paris. Even while hauling 429passengers -- some of them sitting in a special lower deckthat offers a panoramic view of the skies -- the MD-12 couldgo 7,200 nautical miles.   Mr. Wolf also maintained that the MD-12, with a &quot;stickerprice&quot; comparable to the 747 at about $125 million, would be9% cheaper for carriers to operate. The key to the improvedefficiency, he said, is a newly designed wing, which isnearly 60% larger than the MD-11's.</TEXT></DOC>
