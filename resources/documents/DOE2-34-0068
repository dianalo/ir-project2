These calculationsagree well with recent high-precision lifetime measurements, and conflictwith some ab initio estimates which indicated lifetimes shorter thanthose experimentally observed. Our calculations involve the inclusionof experimental energy-level data and the use of a realistic model potential,which utilizes comprehensive spectroscopic measurements that have recentlybecome available. We also demonstrate that the core-polarization effectsare significant and must be included to obtain agreement with experiment.As part of the study, we used the existing data base and Dirac-Fock methodsto determine new values for ionization potentials in this sequence.</TEXT></DOC>
