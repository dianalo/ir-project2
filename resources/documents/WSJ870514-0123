Mr. Bresser Pereira said the government will allow the price of any product to be raised only once a month. Additionally, that increase can't be more than 80% of each month's inflation, he said. Prices will be monitored by the government agency that was responsible for watching price increases while the Cruzado Plan, an anti-inflation program, was in force.    &quot;These measures should put an end to price speculation,&quot; Mr. Bresser Pereira said.    Last week, Mr. Bresser Pereira estimated that consumer prices grew a record 19.5% in April from March. At the current monthly growth, economists predict, inflation could reach about 800% this year.    Rumors have circulated that the government is planning a new price freeze similar to the Cruzado Plan, which collapsed late last year. Mr. Bresser Pereira has denied that another plan is being drawn up, but prices have risen quickly here in the expectation that they eventually will be frozen. </TEXT></DOC>
