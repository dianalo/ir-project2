Radiofrequency assisted dc-glow dischargesin various gases (hydrogen, oxygen, methane) are a flexible tool to producereactive species, which deplete the wall surfaces from reducible oxygen- and carbon compounds, or allow to plasmachemically deposite well definedthin layers onto them. The carbonization technique, i.e. the in situdeposition of amorphous hydrogenated carbon layers (a-C:H) and the resultingeffects on tokamak plasmas are discussed in detail. Its application leadsto significantly improved plasma performance. After its development andcharacterization at the Juelich tokamak TEXTOR it is now being used worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
