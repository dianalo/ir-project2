The regulatory activityof the splenic lymphocytes was studied by assessing changes in the levelof mitogen-induced proliferation of test cultures of lymphocytes fromintact animals in the presence of lymphocytes obtained from infectedmice at different times after infection. Tritium-labelled thymidine wasused as the marker.</TEXT></DOC>
