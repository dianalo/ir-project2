After years of union complaints and legislative debate,momentum is gaining for a federal bill to restrict the use ofhigh-tech tools that secretly monitor employee performance.Hearings on the legislation begin today in the Senate, thefarthest point any such bill has reached there. Meanwhile,affected workers are quietly persuading employers to scaleback some of the practices, such as eavesdropping, on thegrounds that they increase job stress and invite abuse.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It isn't quite like the dam has broken, but a lot ofchanges are afoot,&quot; says Gary T. Marx, a sociology professorat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializesin privacy issues.   The pending changes could significantly affect the workinglives of millions of U.S. employees, mostly women, who laborbehind the scenes in the telecommunications and airlineindustries, in mail order houses and brokerage firms, and injust about any other business that uses phone banks to handleinteractions with customers. In recent years, such employeeshave increasingly come under scrutiny by computers thatgather and analyze data about their work habits, as well asby supervisors who surreptitiously monitor theirconversations with customers.   Employers argue that such methods improve efficiency andguarantee that customer calls will be handled briskly andpolitely. But employee advocacy groups contend that thesurveillance creates an atmosphere so full of stress and fearthat productivity and quality actually decline.   The worker groups point to a raft of recent studiessuggesting that workers who are monitored suffersignificantly higher stress levels. For example, a 1990 studyof telecommunications workers by the University of Wisconsinand the Communications Workers of America found significantlyhigher levels of depression, extreme anxiety and exhaustionamong employees under secret scrutiny.   &quot;Electronic monitoring has enabled employers to turn whatis an already stressful workplace into an electronicsweatshop,&quot; says Tom Higginbotham, general chairman of theInternational Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers, in recent testimony before a House panel.   Opponents also charge that monitoring has led towidespread abuses. Since 1989, when 9to5, the NationalAssociation of Working Women, opened its Computer SpyingHotline, thousands of people have called in with complaints.A woman who said she was a flight reservations agent in NewJersey reported that supervisors disciplined workers who tookmore than 28 seconds a day, total, to switch from one callerto the next, or who spent more than 12 minutes a day awayfrom the computer for bathroom and other needs.   And a woman who says she worked for a New York legaltemporary service called to complain about a boss with anobsession for eavesdropping. After a few months on the job,she says, the owner halved her salary, explaining: &quot;I hearyou talk to all those men friends of yours, and besides, youhave that rich uncle -- let them pay for some of your bills.&quot;   Such stories have prompted demands for legislative reform.A bill introduced in the Senate by Illinois Democrat PaulSimon would force employers to notify workers when monitoringis taking place by, for example, inserting a beeping tone inthe line during eavesdropping. The bill would also prohibitsupervisors from using computer-collected data as the solemeans for evaluating performance, or from posting results ofindividuals. Finally, the measure attempts to ensure thatsurveillance doesn't lead to civil rights abuses, such astargeting workers engaged in union organizing drives.   Sen. Simon's subcommittee on employment and productivityhas scheduled a hearing today. The companion piece in theHouse, introduced by Montana Democrat Pat Williams, hasalready attracted 124 cosponsors from both parties. Twohearings were held this summer, and proponents say themeasure may well reach a floor vote this Congress.   Although passage is far from guaranteed, the bill'sprogress has already made many business groups nervous.Reasons for opposition run the gamut, but many argue that theissues addressed in the bill are more properly covered bydirect negotiations between employers and unions. Airlinesalso worry that the bill, as written, would inhibit theirability to record cockpit conversations and perform othersafety tasks, and that it would be expensive to implement.And telemarketers and customer-service supervisors contendthat warning somebody that they're being monitored defeatsthe whole purpose.   &quot;It would change behavior patterns so much you couldn'tget an accurate reading of how the employee is handling thecustomer relation,&quot; says Richard A. Barton, senior vicepresident of the Direct Marketing Association.   Still, Mr. Barton concedes that many of the bill'sproposals make good sense, and he expects that &quot;some billtightening up the rights to privacy of employees in theworkplace is going to pass.&quot;   Indeed, in some ways electronic monitoring reform has beendriven by the realization that some of businesses' earlyoptimism about technology's ability to extract moreefficiency from workers was misplaced. &quot;There is a widespreadrecognition now that we need to move to forms of managementthat use people's creativity and intelligence more,&quot; saysCharles Heckscher, a professor at Harvard Business School.   Proponents of change point to Bell Canada's example. A fewyears ago, the Montreal-based telephone company kept closetabs on the amount of time operators spent with callers. Theresults, tabulated as &quot;average working time,&quot; became animportant tool to evaluate operators.   But a 1987 survey identified the practice as a principalcause of stress at Bell Canada. And operators showed theirdisapproval in costly ways. One former worker says a commonmethod of boosting times was to simply give directoryassistance callers the wrong number, which was quicker thanlooking up the correct one.   Now, however, Bell Canada has stopped gauging individualAWTs, except for new employees. Instead, the company averagesthe score for entire offices -- without any decline inefficiency.   Others have begun similar policies. In 1989, Denver-basedU S West Corp. began keeping statistics on blocks of workersrather than individuals and started warning operators ofplans to monitor conversations. Supervisors at NWA Inc.'sNorthwest Airlines no longer monitor reservations agentswithout their knowledge and have cut back on such sessions.   And American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. is experimenting inits Richmond, Va., facility with &quot;self-managed teams,&quot;slashing the number of supervisors and notifying operators inadvance of monitoring. Workers being monitored can choose tohave the listener sit next to them or perform the taskremotely. A spokesman says it's too early to gauge success.</TEXT></DOC>
