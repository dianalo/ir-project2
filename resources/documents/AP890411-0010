Moreover, he said, the U.S. export subsidy program _ whichprovides reduced prices for selected commodities in certainoverseas markets _ was a key factor in putting leverage into thenegotiations, particularly in getting approval from the EuropeanEconomic Community.   The EEC had balked at the earlier U.S. insistence that alltrade-distorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the longhaul. The agreement reached in Geneva by more than 100 countriescalls for a ``substantial progressive reduction'' in such subsidies.   Yeutter, in an interview Monday with a group of reporters, saidthe Europeans objected to earlier language calling for the``elimination'' of the subsidies and later to a modified``ratcheting'' down of them.   Asked if the final language represented backtracking on the partof the United States in its quest to do away with trade-distortingsubsidies and other practices, Yeutter replied: ``I don't considerit backtracking at all.''   He maintained that there is no practical difference between``elimination'' or ``ratcheting'' or the accepted ``substantialprogressive reduction'' of subsidies, regardless of what someEuropean leaders may feel.   ``They may have their own reasons for articulating the outcomeof the meeting as they have,'' Yeutter said. ``Obviously, everyonewill go home and, to some degree, at least, articulate their owninterpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs.''   The accord reached in Geneva provides a framework for furtherdiscussions under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, afour-year effort called the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalizeglobal trade. The current GATT round will conclude at the end of1990.   As part of the Geneva agreement, participants agreed to anoverall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990.   Yeutter said the U.S. goal is to gain long-term accord on thefuture of agricultural trade and that the short-term agreementreached in Geneva, while acceptable, was no big challenge for U.S.negotiators.   Some American farm leaders, including Dean Kleckner of theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, had urged Congress to proceedwriting a new general farm bill on an assumption that littleprogress could be expected under the GATT talks.   Yeutter said he had no objection to Congress proceeding with anew farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year.And Yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislationuntil it was clearer how the GATT talks would shape up.   ``Somehow that got misinterpreted ... because that's not reallywhat I meant at all,'' Yeutter said.   ``Assuming that (GATT) negotiations are a success, the 1990 farmlegislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991,'' hesaid. ``But I never meant to indicate that we shouldn't havefull-scale farm legislation in 1990.''   On the matter of U.S. export subsidies used in the ExportEnhancement Program, or EEP, Yeutter said it is ``our view that weare not constrained on EEP expenditures.''   Yeutter said further that he still favors Congress removing thelid on EEP spending so that the United States can match theunrestrained export subsidies of the Europeans. The program, hesaid, was a major factor in reaching the agreement in Geneva lastweek, along with aggressive negotiating and general leverage.   ``In the absence of this combination of leverage _ with the EEPprogram providing a great deal of that leverage _ we very likelywould not have an agreed framework in Geneva today,'' Yeutter said.   In a written statement later, Yeutter repeated his earlierinsistence that the United States ``will continue to aggressivelyseek elimination of trade-distorting measures'' during theremainder of the Uruguay Round.   A background sheet said that in the short-term the United States``in a general way'' is committed not to increase price support andprotection for American farmers.   Specifically, it said, ``We are committed not to intensifymarket access barriers or raise support prices to producers,subject to the condition that the commitment be consistent withexisting legislation.''   The paper added: ``Our assessment is that this will not requireus to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990,our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.''</TEXT></DOC>
