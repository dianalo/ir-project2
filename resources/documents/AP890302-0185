Most of the other members walked out.   Protesters in the gallery shouted ``Nazis out!'' and ``We don'twant Nazi pigs!'' Guards removed them.   When party leader Bernhard Andres rose to speak, the chamber wasnearly deserted.   Andres and the Republicans, who advocate ridding the city offoreign workers and foreigners seeking asylum, surprised the punditsby winning 11 seats in the Jan. 29 elections.   The Christian Democrats and Social Democrats have 55 seats eachand the remaining 17 places in the 138-member parliament are held bythe Alternative List, the West Berlin branch of West Germany'senvironmentalist Greens Party.   At the beginning of Thursday's session, several members of theAlternative List refused to sit near the Republicans. They and theleft-of-center Social Democrats left the chamber and some members ofthe conservative Christian Democrats walked out when Andres rose tospeak.   Before the elections, West Berlin was governed by a coalition ofthe Christian and Social Democrats, but the next government may be aSocial Democrat-Alternative List coalition.   Andres said in his maiden speech that such an administrationwould ``lead to street terror and would be a threat to honestcitizens.   ``When you take off their Red-Green jackets, you might find brownshirts underneath,'' he said in reference to the two parties.   The Brown Shirts were thugs who roamed the streets committingviolence in the early Nazi years.   Heinz Galinski, head of the German Jewish Council, said he wassaddened to see ``an extreme right-wing party once again usingparliament as a stage to preach its ideology.''</TEXT></DOC>
