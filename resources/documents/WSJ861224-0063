In Walnut Creek, voters imposed a building moratorium that stops a shopping center planned by Melvin Simon andamp; Associates Inc. with the city government's support. Los Angelenos, by a 2-to-1 margin, cut in half the building density that will be allowed on 75% of the city's industrial and commercial zones.    But the most far-reaching measure was passed in San Francisco, where voters tightened what already was the nation's strictest limits on growth. The broadly worded measure, known as Proposition M, limits new development to 475,000 square feet a year -- roughly one medium-sized office building -- and protects each neighborhood's &quot;character&quot; from change. Dean Macris, San Francisco's planning director, says, &quot;Some feel this is going to create a lot of mischief, but it's too early to tell whether it will be frustrating to worthwhile projects.&quot; Meanwhile, a Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. spokeswoman says the company &quot;really doesn't know yet&quot; what the initiative means for Mission Bay, the company's massive mixed-use project.    Others are less equivocal. &quot;It's a very bad sign for the long run,&quot; says Richard Wollack, president of Johnstown/Consolidated Institutional Advisers Inc. &quot;It says this is an anti-moderate-growth city. It's a real setback.&quot; Michael Barker, a developer, blames local real estate interests for not fighting the measure more aggressively. &quot;The developers just rolled over and played dead,&quot; he says. &quot;To me, it sends the worst message to business: We'd just as soon you go to Los Angeles.&quot;    In Los Angeles, the message of Proposition U seems to be that residents want better planning, not a halt to growth. Los Angeles Planning Director Kenneth Topping says the measure came about as a result of high-rise towers popping up next to residential neighborhoods. Established commercial areas like downtown and Century City are unaffected by the initiative.    In Walnut Creek, traffic was the issue. Greg Glass, senior vice president of Melvin Simon andamp; Associates, calls it &quot;a knee-jerk reaction to a real problem. Across California, bedroom communities haven't been able to keep up with traffic.&quot; Unless the initiative is repealed, Mr. Glass says, estimates are that $350 million or more in traffic improvements will be needed before development can resume. &quot;They've shut down this city until I don't know when.&quot;    ---   Thirty Advisers Fight for Big Account    The California Public Employees Retirement System recently held what amounted to the Super Bowl for money managers specializing in real estate. More than 30 real estate advisory firms competed for three new assignments. In the end, the Calpers board added Heitman Financial Ltd., Richard Ellis Inc. and Trust Co. of the West to its lineup which already included Equitable Life Assurance Society, LaSalle Partners, and Financial Investment Associates.    Winning the assignment is no small victory. Not only does the fund have a market value of $39 billion, but it plans to increase its investment in real estate to 10% of assets from 4.5% in the years ahead.    By adding real estate advisers, the fund seems to be saying that six sets of eyes on the market are better than three. William Ramseyer of Pension Realty Advisers Inc., a San Francisco consultant that helped with the selection, says, &quot;In these markets, we need all of the exposure that we can get.&quot;    Finding the types of properties that the fund wants hasn't been easy. Not only are commercial rents plummeting nationally, but the Japanese have been bidding up the prices of top-quality properties lately. This has made it difficult to find quality properties with acceptable cash flows. &quot;Pricing has been a problem,&quot; says Mr. Ramseyer. &quot;But we also haven't seen the quality of location and structure that we'd like.&quot;    ---   Pact Eludes Trump and Japanese Firm    The on-again, off-again negotiations between New York builder Donald Trump and Japanese builder Kumagai Gumi Co. to team up to build Mr. Trump's Television City project on Manhattan's West Side appear to have ended. The final blow to the negotiations reportedly was the death of Jinichi Makita, Kumagai's 94-year-old chairman, on Nov. 12.    Mr. Makita reportedly had revived talks with Mr. Trump after a tentative agreement fell apart. Earlier this year, Kumagai executives had agreed to take a 25% stake in the massive, 62-acre development project for $97 million. But shortly after reaching an agreement, real estate executives say, Mr. Trump, always the poker player, raised his price to $160 million. Feeling that an agreement had been broken, Kumagai executives terminated talks. Mr. Trump, his bluff having been called, reportedly dropped his demand for a higher price, but Kumagai executives in New York still said no.    Mr. Makita, however, was still interested and directed his staff to pursue the project. Now with Mr. Makita gone, so too apparently are the chances for Kumagai's participation in Television City. But Mr. Trump says that he won't miss Kumagai and that he called the deal off. &quot;I just didn't want to make the deal. I'm really not looking for partners.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
