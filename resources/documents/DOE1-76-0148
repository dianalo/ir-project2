Partof the work is analytical, but in recent years also experimental workhas been carried out, especially on refrigerators. In Europe it is commonto have refrigerators with + 5 deg. C and freezers with -18 deg. C astwo separate units. This is appropriate from an energy conservation pointof view, and we have therefore investigated a typically sized 200 litresrefrigerator with automatic defrosting but no freezer compartment. Atpresent one such prototype at our laboratory shows an electricity consumptionof 82 kWh/year, according to European standard test procedures. Thisis around 45% of the consumption for the best model on todays Danishmarket with the same features (or 16% of what was typical in 1973). Thecosteffectiveness of our improvements seems good. The paper describeshow our prototype is designed to achieve the savings by 1) lowering transmissionloss by moderately increasing insulation thickness and 2) increasingCOP by reducing temperature differences between heat exchangers and thesurrounding air. The reduced temperature differences are in turn obtainedby redesigning the heat exchangers for larger sizes and larger heat capacities.Although a COP value of 2.3 is attained there is still room for improvementstowards the value of 14 for a thermodynamically ideal system.</TEXT></DOC>
