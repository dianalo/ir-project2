One magazine said two of the nine missing Americans will bereleased.   Also Saturday, Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe, who spent oneweek in Lebanon trying to verify reports hostage Brian Keenan mightbe released, said there was ``a distinct possibility'' Keenan wouldbe freed.   The reports marked the first time several Lebanese publicationshave simultaneously carried nearly identical articles about thepossible release of foreign captives. The reports came shortly aftera top Iranian official and a Shiite Moslem leader predicted abreakthrough in the hostage problem.   The An-Nahar Arab and International weekly said theIranian-backed Hezbollah has ``decided to release two Americancaptives as a goodwill gesture.'' It gave no names.   The magazine, based in Christian east Beirut, quoted anunidentified Hezbollah official as saying: ``The scenario is beingset for the release.'' The brief report did not elaborate.   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite Moslem zealots, is believed to bethe umbrella organization for several groups holding hostages.   There are 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. In addition to thenine Americans and Keenan, who holds both Irish and Britishcitizenship, there are three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian.   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   The leftist daily As-Safir, which has close ties with the Syrianarmy command in Lebanon, said: ``Diplomatic information speaks ofthe possible release of some (foreign) hostages in the next twoweeks.''   The weekly Ash-Shiraa said the hostage issue ``has been put on ahot burner.'' Its brief report said without elaborating: ``Thiscould result in releasing them ... in the light of a decision tothis effect adopted by regional powers interested in this case.''   The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar dailies bothsaid a peace pact reached Monday in Damascus between Hezbollah andAmal, the rival pro-Syrian Shiite militia, also aims at securing therelease of foreign captives. The pact, sponsored by Syria and Iran,halted a nine-month war between the rival militias.   ``Informed sources believe that the basic aim of theAmal-Hezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captivesheld in Lebanon,'' said An-Nahar, Lebanon's most prestigiousnewspaper. The report did not elaborate.   Ad-Diyar quoted an unidentified official as saying theAmal-Hezbollah accord ``could result in the handing over of someforeign hostages to the Syrians.''   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troopsdeployed in predominantly Moslem areas.   In the past, some foreign captives were set free inSyrian-controlled sectors of Lebanon, and the Syrians took creditfor their release.   The Irish ambassador, who spent one week in Lebanon trying toverify reports about Keenan's possible release, returned to Iraq onSaturday.   Before departing he told reporters: ``I leave with the impressionthat the release of Brian Keenan before long remains a distinctpossibility.''   Keenan, a teacher from Belfast, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 inBeirut's Moslem sector. No group has claimed his abduction.   McCabe said he would return to Lebanon ``in coming weeks orsooner'' if necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
