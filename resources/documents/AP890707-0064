But while the announcement was expected by day's end, Bush stillhad not signed off on details of the proposals, said one official,who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   ``It's still on his desk,'' the official said.   Both The Washington Post and The Washington Times reported thatBush would formally ask Congress today for the pay raise for topofficials and would couple it with a proposed ban on congressionalhonoraria.   Sources said the proposal now on Bush's desk does not contain aspecific pay raise proopsal for Congress to go along with theproposed limit on outside income.   Bush has advocated pay raises in general for Congress, but hasdecided to steer clear of becoming ensnared in what is always apoltically treacherous issue on Capitol Hill, deciding instead tolet Congress resolve the matter itself, the sources said.   An announcement on the pay issue seemed likely today as thepresident sought to clear away unfinished business before embarkingSunday on a nine-day trip to Europe that will include theseven-nation economic summit in Paris.   The Washington Post said Bush's pay package would includeincreases of as much as 200 percent for a small number of``critically skilled'' federal workers.   However, sources said the increase for most other senior federalofficials would be an across-the-board 25 percent.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Thursday night said theWhite House expects to announce the president's decisions today.   G. Jerry Shaw, counsel to the Senior Executives Association, saidhe had heard the president's proposal would be for 25 percent buthad not received definitive word on that point.   ``We strongly support the raise,'' Shaw said.   The association, however, has opposed larger increases for keyspecialists such as physicians the government is having troublerecruiting and training.   The 7,200 members of the government's Senior Executive Serviceand 800 top presidentially appointed executives currently make$68,700 to $80,700. Their pay is tied to the $89,500 that members ofCongress get, and the rejection of the congressional pay increase inFebruary meant no raise for them or for judges.   A private commission headed by former Federal Reserve BoardChairman Paul Volker recommended a 25 percent increase immediatelyfollowed by a similar amount in 1991, applying to judges, executivebranch officials, members of Congress and others such as topmilitary officers.   The newspaper said Bush had decided not to change his previouslyannounced proposals for Congress to decide its own pay increase andfor a ban on honoraria, the fees members of Congress get for makingspeeches.</TEXT></DOC>
