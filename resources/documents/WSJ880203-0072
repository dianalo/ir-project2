By publishing a thick book yesterday, Sandamp;P officials say the ratings agency is trying to make its criteria the industry standard for rating mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, a rapidly growing market. Sandamp;P is making its pitch primarily toward the investment banks and issuers who request and pay for ratings.    Sandamp;P describes the massive tome as an attempt to serve the market, but officials readily admit they're really trying to snare clients. Although the book -- &quot;Sandamp;P's Structured Finance Criteria&quot; -- officially costs $79, Sandamp;P plans to send hundreds of free copies to investment bankers, issuers and other potential clients.    Moody's, which has been equally aggressive, has been targeting primarily the investor audience that uses ratings. Moody's main technique has been to rate asset-backed issues whether or not a rating has been requested. The unsolicited ratings are lower than those issued by Sandamp;P, and some investment bankers and issuers charge they're based on insufficient information.    For example, Moody's double-A-1 rating on some Ryland Acceptance Corp. securities was based on &quot;limited knowledge,&quot; charged Tom Potts, executive vice president of the company. Sandamp;P rated those securities triple-A. &quot;We generally send Sandamp;P over 100 pages of reports,&quot; he said, adding that the company doesn't believe Moody's had much of that information.    Moody's has said previously that it won't rate an issue unless it believes it has sufficient information.    Moody's historically has been reluctant to give out specific ratings criteria, and M. Douglas Watson, the vice president and director who heads the firm's structured finance group, says that's still the case. While he hasn't seen the Sandamp;P book, he says Moody's isn't likely to issue anything similar.    &quot;Lots of things in this arena are gray,&quot; he explains. &quot;Though we provide guidance, we're not going to give a rule book.&quot; Moody's publications generally analyze the risks involved in asset-backed financings in somewhat general terms, rather than focusing on the criteria needed to get a specific rating.    Sandamp;P officials concede their new book alone won't give issuers enough information to get a triple-A. In fact, they say, the proliferation of new types of securities over the past few years has forced the agency to take a more subjective approach to its ratings.    &quot;We think these will continue to evolve,&quot; says Stephen W. Joynt, co-head of the agency's financial institutions and structured finance department. But the book still provides &quot;a good prescription&quot; for issuers, he adds.    Both Sandamp;P and Moody's may benefit from their struggle. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., for instance, recently suggested to issuers and investors that they seek a review by both agencies when issuing or buying asset-backed securities. </TEXT></DOC>
