Late yesterday the Transportation Department rejectedBritish Airways PLC's plan to slash fares to London from theU.S. by one-third for travel between April 6 and Oct. 31.That plan prompted U.S. competitors to cut their fares evenfurther.</LP><TEXT>   British Air's move was an attempt to spark overseastravel, which has fallen sharply since the Persian Gulfconflict and has hurt carriers' balance sheets. Onlyyesterday, British Air forecast a &quot;substantial operatingloss&quot; for its current fiscal fourth quarter, and reportedthat in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, pretax profittumbled 71% from a year earlier to #20 million (US$40million).   In its decision, the Transportation Department said itwould clear the fare cut for travel until April 30 if BritishAirways submits a new fare proposal. For the period afterApril 30, the department said it would &quot;evaluate thesituation in light of certain factors at that time.&quot;   It said, &quot;These factors would include the success ofnegotiations with the U.K. to permit the United States toname replacement carriers to suceed Pan American and TransWorld Airlines at London's Heathrow Airport.&quot;   While playing hardball is a hallmark of most bilateraltrade negotiations, it is unusual for the U.S. in itsdealings with British fare proposals. The move shockedindustry officials and placed further strain on the talks.Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner yesterday called thepace of the talks &quot;disappointing.&quot;   TWA has agreed to sell its London routes to AMR Corp.'sAmerican Airlines unit for $445 million. Pan Am has signed apact to sell its London routes to UAL Corp.'s United Airlinesunit for $290 million. Pan Am and TWA, both financiallyailing, have indicated their survival depends on completionof the proposed sales.   Under the U.S.-U.K. pact on air services, the so-calledBermuda 2 treaty, Pan Am and TWA are the only two U.S.carriers permitted to fly into Heathrow. The treaty languagesays the rights can only be transfered to a &quot;corporatesuccessor.&quot;   In the decision, Mr. Skinner said, &quot;Unfortunately, theBritish Airways proposal, as presented, covers travel duringa period in which, because of the disappointing pace of ournegotiations, we are uncertain which U.S. airlines will beoperating out of Heathrow.&quot;   In exchange for approval of the fare cutting past April30, the Transportation Department also said it wanted &quot;theresponse of U.K. aviation authorities to similar fareproposals by U.S. carriers.&quot;   British Air's fare cutting triggered TWA to slash itsU.S.-U.K. prices in half for sale until next Monday. United,Pan Am and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines followed with asimilar plan. Northwest yesterday extended its fare cuttingto four other European cities besides London. Americanmatched British Air's fares.   British Air executives are understood to be vehementlyopposed to any connection between the fare cuts and thebilateral talks. As one industry observer said, theTransportation Department has created &quot;linkage,&quot; a term usedby President Bush to characterize Iraqi leader SaddamHussein's attempts to wed discussions on the Palestinianissue with talks on Kuwait.   In an unusual public statement, British Air yesterdaycalled on the British government for political help incompeting with U.S. and continental European carriers. Iturged the government to continue demanding tough concessionsfrom Washington in its dispute over Heathrow airport, whichis popular because of its size and proximity to centralLondon.   Without government protection, British Air Chairman LordKing said, &quot;a flock of British sparrows won't stand much of achance against the onslaught of American eagles.&quot;   A person familiar with the Transportation Department'sdecision said discount fares that British Air has alreadysold are valid despite the development. The airline, however,can only continue to keep selling the low fares for 48 hoursafter receiving notice of the Transportation Department'sdecision, which was transmitted electronically through acomputer fare data base yesterday.   It isn't yet clear how the British government willrespond. Officials at the British embassy in Washington werenotified yesterday as well. Unlike in the domestic skies,international fare changes require government approvals.   The Transportation Department said it had approved&quot;virtually all fares&quot; filed by British airlines, while theBritish government rejected &quot;many&quot; filed by U.S. carriers. Itsaid British officials rejected &quot;more than&quot; 400 U.S. filingslast year.   The department seems willing to entertain a new,shorter-duration fare cut by British Air. It said itrecognizes that transAtlantic travel has been &quot;hard hit&quot; bythe war and the economy in the U.S. and Europe.   Indeed, British Air said yesterday it isn't putting intoservice five new Boeing Co. jets it ordered earlier. ABritish Airways spokesman said the airline will acceptdelivery of the aircraft as scheduled this year, but willsimply leave them on the ground to save money, &quot;untilbusiness picks up.&quot;   For the third quarter just ended, it reported revenue rose3.9% to #1.24 billion from #1.19 billion.   One London newspaper Monday predicted postponement of #1billion in McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrieorders that British Airways had been contemplating. Thecompany continued to dismiss that report as speculative.   Though British Airways declined to elaborate on LordKing's forecast of a &quot;substantial&quot; fourth-period operatingloss, one London industry analyst, Richard Hannah ofstockbrokers UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew Ltd., said it may totalabout #150 million. A year earlier, operating profit was #14million. The company said its passenger traffic has dropped20% since the war began Jan. 16.</TEXT></DOC>
