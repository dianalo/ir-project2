(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state agency is investigating thedeaths of 19 wild vultures at Walt Disney World's Discovery Islandduring a trapping-and-removal operation for the unwanted predators.   Disney spokesman Charlie Ridgway acknowledged Friday that about15 vultures died of heat exhaustion in a storage shed while awaitingtransfer to a nearby wildlife refuge.   ``We are cooperating fully in the investigation'' by the stateGame and Fresh Water Fish Commission, Ridgway said. ``We had, andstill have, a problem with the vultures. We did relocate a number ofthem and _ purely accidentally _ about 15 of the vultures died ofheat exhaustion in the hot summer heat.''   Curator Charles L. Cook of Discovery Island received an emergencyfederal permit May 24 to relocate up to 100 of the aggressivescavenger birds that were bothering visitors and threatening rarebirds and animals on the 11-acre sanctuary and tourist site.   A subsequent report filed by Cook said 149 vultures werecaptured, according to a story for the New York Times RegionalNewspapers. Other Disney documents show 19 vultures died in thetrapping operation, 18 were released and 112 were moved toChassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge.   Ridgway said he didn't have details of the operation, but thenumber of vultures specified in the federal permit was exceededthrough a misunderstanding and there was no intent to harm any ofthe vultures.   Cook could not be reached for comment.   While common in Florida and other Southern states, the large,black vulture is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.Violations can bring up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine forindividuals and a $10,000 fine for corporations.   ``They perform an extremely valuable function in cleansing theland of dead animals,'' said Phil Million, a spokesman for the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service.   The vultures have become an increasing problem at DiscoveryIsland, where they are attracted by the food supply around theisland and a nearby campground, Disney officials have said.   In letters to wildlife officials, Disney said the vultures haveattacked Galapagos tortoises and brown pelicans, consumed largestocks of animal feed and even torn apart furniture at the park.   ``Discovery Island is to these birds like Social Security in yoursenile human population ... They never had it so good,''veterinarian E.E. Schobert wrote in a letter that Disney filed withits request for state assistance.   Walt Disney World has acquired a reputation for innovativeenvironmental and wildlife projects, including the training ofmonkeys for use by paraplegics.</TEXT></DOC>
