I know George Bush. And I know he knows better.&quot;    Now, that's a story: George Bush may be crisscrossing the country telling Americans he won't raise taxes, but Strauss-the-insider knows he doesn't really mean it. Read Bob's lips! We're not sure what this tells us about the Vice President, but we're sure it tells us all we need to know about the National Economic Commission.    This is a body established by Congress and the rest of Washington's elite to depose, under the rubric of &quot;deficit cutting,&quot; a newly elected President even before he's inaugurated. Mr. Strauss spoke yesterday in what was billed as a &quot;special presentation&quot; to an economic-policy conference in Washington. He was more than willing to tell the assembled elite all about the commission's progress.    Co-chairman Strauss and the 11 other commissioners won't do the voters the same favor, though. The &quot;Sunshine Act&quot; says all meetings of presidential commissions must be open to the public, but Mr. Strauss acknowledged that his commission is using a loophole to evade the law. So long as the commission just gets together in &quot;subgroups&quot; of six or fewer members, he said, it's not technically a &quot;meeting&quot; under the law. We hope that Mr. Strauss has an opportunity to tell this to a judge.    With public hearings, Mr. Strauss worried, voters might actually be exposed to some of the deficit-cutting testimony he and his colleagues are hearing, and maybe &quot;we'd have a debate.&quot; But voters just don't have the same depth of civic virtue as Mr. Strauss and his colleagues. &quot;People aren't really concerned about the deficit,&quot; he lamented. And not only that, they don't like new taxes. The voters might object, the politicians would have to object, and before you knew it democracy might make Bob Strauss and the National Economic Commission irrelevant.    Mr. Strauss also described critics who think the NEC is a tax-boost dodge as those who &quot;think deficits don't matter.&quot; Incredibly, even three of the 12 commission members aren't as concerned about deficits as they should be, he said. Which is to say, no doubt, that they are the minority opposed to giving Washington insiders more money to play with.    The commission plans to keep quiet until after Nov. 8, when the voters won't be able to do them any harm. (Seriously, we're not making it up; Mr. Strauss actually said this.) The commission's report is scheduled to be released in December, just in time for a new President's inauguration.    We don't know what Mr. Bush thinks of all this, but we do recall that Machiavelli advised that princes aren't likely to reign successfully if they let courtiers plot coups with impunity. Perhaps Mr. Bush should remind Mr. Strauss whose lips the voters are supposed to read. </TEXT></DOC>
