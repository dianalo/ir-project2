Three mineral soil horizons from each of six western WashingtonState soil series were evaluated for their potential to sorb Cd. Horizonsvaried in pH from 3.6 to 6.4, in clay content from 100 to 470 g kg{sup-1}, in organic C from 3 to 87 g kg{sup -1}, and in cation exchange capacityfrom 1.8 to 35.8 cmol/sub c/ kg{sup -1}. Batch equilibrium experimentswere conducted in three background solutions (calcium nitrate, calciumsulfate, and sodium sulfate) that had ionic strengths of 0.016 and weremaintained at pH values close to the natural soil pH. Between 4 and 97%of the initial 10 {mu}M Cd was sorbed by 1 g soil in 0.1-L backgroundsolution. Sorption varied among the horizons in each soil profile, butthere was no consistent trend with depth among the six profiles. Sorptiondid not differ significantly between calcium nitrate and calcium sulfatesolutions. However, it was significantly lower in calcium sulfate thansodium sulfate solution, supporting the hypothesis that calcium competitionlowers Cd sorption. The amount of Cd sorbed when a solution concentrationof 1 {mu}M free Cd{sup 2+} is maintained (Cd/sub sorbed/) decreased 81%when free Ca{sup 2+} increased from 0.09 mM Ca{sup 2+} in sodium sulfateto 4.0 mM Ca{sup 2+} in calcium sulfate solution. The Cd/sub sorbed/increased with increased natural soil pH. A horizons had higher Cd/subsorbed/ than B horizons of similar natural soil pH, possible due to theirhigher organic matter contents.</TEXT></DOC>
