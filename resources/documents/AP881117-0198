The FCC also, however, reopened a thorny issue that earlier metvigorous opposition from the providers of these electronicinformation services who resisted an agency proposal to add heftycharges to their bills.   The commission's action moves toward opening the phone networksso that connections and circuits will be available on an equal basisto competing companies that want to provide advanced phone services.   Competition, the commission says, will result in lower prices andmore choices for consumers, as long as the Bell companies are notallowed to use their control of the local phone networks todisadvantage competitors.   Open Network Architecture, as the plan is called, ``will passalong to average residential consumers the ability to patronize thefruits of the information age,'' said FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.   The three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to approve theBell companies' plans in substantial part but to require revisionsin specified areas, in part to ensure greater uniformity among theirseparate plans. The FCC also approved American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo.'s plan in total.   Many of the enhanced services dealt with in the plans are alreadyavailable on a limited scale from the phone companies. Open NetworkArchitecture is expected to result in more competition, which wouldbring the services to more consumers at lower prices, the FCC said.   The FCC pointed to voice mail as an example of a service that itexpects to become more widely available and attractive to averageconsumers. This service permits callers to send and receive recordedmessages in a manner similar to that now available with telephoneanswering machines.   However, instead of having to buy an answering machine, callerswould need only a touch-tone phone. The messaging capabilities wouldbe provided out of a centralized computer.   Computer gateways allows easier access to electronic data bases.Computer users would have access to many different informationservices by dialing just one number.   Most of the Bell companies applauded the action, but BellSouthsaid the FCC should have allowed its plan to charge informationservice providers based on their usage of the network, instead of aflat rate as they are now.   Attorney Stephen Bell, who represents Tymnet and has been aleading spokesman for the information providers, said that whilethere was ``a lot of good news'' in the FCC's action, he wasconcerned about the issue of how these providers will be charged byphone companies.   The commission specifically noted that an existing exemption fromnetwork access charges would continue for information serviceproviders, although the FCC agreed to begin proceedings that couldconsider removing the exemption under certain circumstances.   ``This could have a dramatic and serious effect on theinformation services industry,'' Bell said, promising to fightvigorously against removal of the exemption.   Earlier this year, after an outcry from the industry, the FCCretreated from a proposal to lift the exemption. Without theexemption, costs could more than double, in some cases, for computerusers dialing into information data bases.</TEXT></DOC>
