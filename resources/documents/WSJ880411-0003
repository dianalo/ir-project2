Although British base rates fell half a point to 8% Friday -- their lowest level in a decade -- the pound persevered to close higher against the mark and unchanged against the dollar. Foreign exchange markets probably will be quiet early this week, before the Group of Seven finance ministers meet in Washington. But after that, economists here expect sterling to resume its rise, pushing toward $1.90 and 3.15-3.20 marks.    By today, &quot;We'll all be wondering what (the base-rate cut) has achieved,&quot; Graham Turner, an economist at Warburg Securities in London, predicted Friday. &quot;And the answer is, not much. Cutting base rates will do nothing to divert the current bullish sentiment from sterling.&quot;    Friday's interest rate cut followed apparently coordinated, and largely unsuccessful, intervention by the Bank of England and the West German central bank earlier last week to buy dollars for pounds. Sterling's continued resistance to downward pressure is a blow against Britain's efforts to maintain stable exchange rates. And sharp cuts in interest rates renew worries about a further deterioration in Britain's widening current-account deficit.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson surprised markets Friday by directing banks to cut their base rates to 8%. The previous day sterling had surged to a two-year high in London of 3.13 marks despite the apparent intervention by central banks. When trading opened Friday, the pound continued to rise, quickly edging above 3.14 marks.    Later that morning, the Bank of England lowered its money market intervention rate 3/8 point to 8%, prompting Midland Bank PLC to announce its base-rate reduction. Other leading British banks soon followed. Last month, banks decreased base rates to 8 1/2% from 9%, reversing a half-point rise Feb.1.    Government officials said they intended the base-rate cut to counteract somewhat the tightening of monetary policy caused by the rising pound. Officials said they also wanted to send a decisive signal to investors that the government would prevent the pound rising &quot;unsustainably.&quot; But despite the effort, sterling closed Friday at 3.14, up a pfennig from Thursday. The pound rose a little against the dollar, to $1.8755 from $1.8720.    Sterling remains buoyed by Britain's probable strong economic growth this year, its relatively high interest rates compared with West Germany and Japan, and by investors' skepticism over whether the British government will cut interest rates here further. &quot;With the fundamentals still in sterling's favor, it remains the currency to be with,&quot; said Peter Fellner, an economist at stockbrokers James Capel andamp; Co.    With sterling rising, inflation doesn't seem a likely result of the downward ratchet in interest rates. A bigger worry is a further deterioration in Britain's current-account deficit, which stood at #720 million ($1.35 billion) in February compared with a surplus of #430 million a year earlier. The current account tallies a nation's trade in goods, services and certain unilateral transfers. A further decline in Britain's current-account deficit could occur if higher demand, resulting from lower interest rates, sucks in more imports.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar was little changed as attention turned to Wednesday's expected meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven nations and Thursday's report of the U.S. trade balance for February.    Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6750 West German marks, down from 1.6765 Thursday. The dollar was unchanged at 125.70 yen, although in early trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was changing hands at 125.75 yen.    The pound fell slightly to $1.8745, from $1.8750, and was unchanged at 3.14 marks in New York trading.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 80 cents an ounce to $451.60 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces. Gold was quoted at $450.50 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Friday, April 8, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
