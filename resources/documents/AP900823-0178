Noriega's attorneys, who have estimated it could cost $5 millionto defend the ousted Panamanian dictator on drug traffickingcharges, are trying to track millions of dollars believed held inforeign banks.   The U.S. government has agreed up to $6 million of Noriega'smoney should be available to the defense, but left it to hisattorneys to track it down.   The Union Bank of Zurich, Switzerland, is complying with therecords request, said bank attorney John D. Lovi of the New Yorklaw firm of Sullivan and Cromwell and assistant U.S. Attorney MylesMalman.   The records of the account were turned over by the bank to theSwiss government, and under the terms of an international treatythat government turned them over to the U.S. government, Lovi toldU.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.   Malman told the judge that the Justice Department is expected toturn this material over to Noriega attorney Frank Rubino, and asubpoena has been withdrawn.   The prosecutor said Deutsh Sudamerkanische Bank of Hamburg,Germany, has declined a request to turn over records on the account.   ``The account, upon best information and belief, is in the nameof the Banco Nacional of Panama, which may have its own rights andinterest in the account,'' according to prosecution documents.``The United States has none, and takes no position whetherDSB-Hamburg should be compelled to comply with Noriega's subpoena.''   Bank attorney Barry Hunter said the bank ``does not have aNoriega account.'' He said the account was opened in 1988, a yearbefore the dispute between the current government and Noriega.   He said by invoking a certain legal procedure, Noriega'sattorneys could obtain the information in 30 to 60 days, but theyhave said that would take too long.   Rubino has said he wants to find out how much money is still inthe account and where the money has gone.   Bank Lyonnaise of Marseille, France, has also been asked to turnover records.   Federal Magistrate William Turnoff said Aug. 2 that the banksmust comply with subpoenas to supply records to the defense.   It was the first time that a federal court has backed a privatelitigant's request to examine usually secret foreign bank records,Rubino said then.   Ramon Anzola, who said he represented the Panamanian government,told the judge that even if defense attorneys find the money, thefunds should not be paid to Noriega.   Panama is filing a $5.3 billion racketeering suit againstNoriega aimed at collecting funds it says belong to the people ofPanama.   Rubino has said Noriega's money, estimated at more than $20million, is deposited in about six European countries. The defensehas claimed that Noriega earned much of the money legally,including as an informant for U.S. intelligence agencies, so it wasunfair for the United States to freeze his access to all hisaccounts. Noriega has had no way of monitoring the accounts sincehis arrest.   Noriega is being held in a jail outside Miami awaiting trial oncharges he took $4.6 million in bribes to protect the Colombiancocaine trade.</TEXT></DOC>
