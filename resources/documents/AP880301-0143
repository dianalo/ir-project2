Sen. Bob Dole scored Vice President George Bush for his role inthe Iran-Contra affair in one new ad. In another, Rep. Marvin Leathof Texas criticizes two Democrats competing against his colleague,Rep. Richard Gephardt.   The candidates under attack _ Bush, Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ all have producedhard-hitting TV ads of their own and were expected to respondpromptly.   Television is shaping up as the candidates' most important toolin the far-flung Super Tuesday contests on March 8. There are 712Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic delegates up for grabsthat day in caucuses and primaries in 20 states and American Samoa.   Super Tuesday stretches across more than 150 media markets andmore than 500 television stations, with a multi-million dollarprice tag for any candidate who wanted to clog the air withcommercials.   Most of the contenders were targeting their media spending tocarefully selected areas where they thoguht they had the bestchances of winning delegates. Both Dukakis and Gore predicted theywould in the end have spent the most for Super Tuesday; Bush hadthe most money in the bank as the contest approached.   Dole and Gephardt were first out of the box with negative ads.   One Dole spot depicts someone walking through snow but leavingno footprints. Dole campaign manager Bill Brock said the message isthat Bush ``has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark.   Another ad, the first to inject the Iran-Contra affair into thecampaign, says Dole was ``opposed selling arms to Iran. Bushsupported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses Bush ofwaffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet armscontrol treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in severalSouthern states.   In his ad on behalf of Gephardt, Leath said the Missouricongressman ``stood with us for lower taxes, for an oil import feeto make America strong, for a tough trade bill to stand up forAmerican workers.''   ``On all these issues, Gore and Dukakis were opposed to us. Goreand Dukakis even think the Gephardt trade bill is too tough on theJapanese, Europeans and Koreans. We're tired of hearing that youcan't fight for America anymore. That's why 35 Southern congressmanare fighting for Dick Gephardt for president,'' Leath says in thead.   Gephardt also is using a slightly retooled version of acommercial that gave him the edge he needed to beat Dukakis lastweek in South Dakota. The ad called Dukakis ``one of the biggesttax raisers in Massachusetts history'' and mocked the governor'ssuggestion that struggling Iowa farmers switch to growing Belgianendive.   The Dukakis campaign has prepared several tough responses,including an ad that shows a weathervane swinging back and forth asa narrator accuses Gephardt of flip-flops on issues.   Leslie Dach, the campaign's communications director, declined toprovide any scripts because he said final decisions on what wouldbe used, when and where had not been made.   But he said the general content would be along the followinglines: ``He says he is leading the little guy's fight but hiscampaign is financed and supported by the big guys. His biggestcontributors are America's biggest corporations. He has failed toshow a set of principles or a set of values that give a rudder tohis policies.''   In a footnote to the fierce Super Tuesday TV campaign, Rep. JackKemp, R-N.Y., began attacking Pat Robertson in ads running on radiostations in South Carolina. The state holds a GOP primary onSaturday.   The Kemp ad asks if the former television evangelist has ``thequalifications and the judgment to be our next president'' andcites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestionthat public schools be eliminated. Robertson later changed his mind.   In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using moresubdued biographical spots and traditional political testimonials.Among them: former Sen. Barry Goldwater endorses Bush, former HouseSpeaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts praises Dukakis, andRep. Claude Pepper _ an elderly Florida legislator with enormousclout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of Gephardt.   Gephardt is also using the Hyundai ad credited with putting hiscampaign message into sharp focus and helping him win last month'sIowa caucuses. In the spot he criticizes South Korea for puttingstiff tariffs on U.S. autos and asks how many Hyundais the Koreanscould sell here at $48,000 apiece.</TEXT></DOC>
