Third-period net income climbed to $83 million, or $1.21 a share, from $62 million, or 90 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 9.5% to $876 million from $800 million.    &quot;Our performance (in the third) quarter reflects our continuing ability to control costs while attracting significantly increased business,&quot; said L. Stanley Crane, chairman and chief executive officer. Freight traffic rose 7.3% in the quarter.    While Conrail expects freight traffic to remain strong in the fourth quarter, Mr. Crane said, &quot;We do not expect the same percentage increases in traffic over the prior year, since the fourth quarter of 1987 reflected substantial increases in coal and steel traffic.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Conrail shares closed at $33.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
