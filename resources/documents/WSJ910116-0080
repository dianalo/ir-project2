The Pittsburgh-based software company, whose work is beingsupported by computer giants such as International BusinessMachines Corp., said its technology will sharply spread theavailability of so-called on-line transaction processing bymaking it widely available on the Unix operating system.</LP><TEXT>   Big companies have shown great interest in recent years intransaction processing, which involves constantly updating alarge database. They have begun using such systems to speedtheir ability to process information on day-to-dayoperations. But the prices of transaction-processing systemshave put them well out of reach of smaller concerns.   &quot;This is a very big deal,&quot; said John R. Rymer, an analystat Patricia Seybold's Office Computing Group, a consultingfirm in Boston. He cautioned, though, that &quot;products builtusing Transarc's technology won't be available for sometime,&quot; probably not before 1993.   At the moment, transaction-processing systems tend to beset up by big companies to handle airline or hotelreservations, networks of automated teller machines and otheroperations that handle huge numbers of computers and enormousdatabases. But those systems are as expensive as they arelarge, requiring numerous mainframes and expensive software.   Prices have come down in some cases as companies havebuilt transaction-processing applications on top of the Unixoperating system, an industrywide standard that's muchcheaper than the proprietary operating systems that manycomputer companies offer. Still, companies that dotransaction-processing on Unix have had to do much of theprogramming on their own, which can be messy and expensive.   What Transarc promises is technology that IBM,Hewlett-Packard Co. and several other companies have saidthey will include as standard in their versions of Unix.Transarc promises another feature, too, that should cutcosts. Its transaction-processing software lets usersdistribute the work across numerous inexpensive workstations.In addition, adding capacity would require only addinganother workstation or two, rather than having the mainframereplaced by a bigger one.   Mr. Rymer said big retailers have set uptransaction-processing systems so they can figure out what'shot and what's not in time to do something about it. Thesystems let the cash registers in the stores update the maincomputer database at least daily, if not more often.   &quot;But what about regional retailers&quot; who want to keepbetter track of operations? Mr. Rymer asked. &quot;What aboutlocal retailers -- the guy with five hardware stores in acity? Those are the guys who are going to snap up&quot; Transarcsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
