people onlycommunicate with one another, but they work alone; E-mail takes care of thecommunicating, so forget the groupware hype; concentrate on E-mailcapabilities and on its &quot;seamless&quot; integration with other applications.andM;What a strange idea that group work reduces to the logical equivalent ofE-mail.andP;  Ask yourself: Would we still need meetings if we had super(multimedia, very faste E-mail?andP;  Of course we would, because the essence of ameeting is coordination (often with the help of a chairperson).andP;  You don'tget music just by everyone sounding their separate instruments.andP;  That onlygenerates noise.andP;  The metaphor applies to our whole work environment.andM;Fred Gibbons says that groupware is nothing but a gimmick to stimulatesoftware sales.andP;  I say the term &quot;groupware&quot; has sprung up as a symptom of amegatrend: the coming of powerful desktop machines, configured into networks.andO;Suddenly--by historical standards--very many people can interconnect by a newand amazing information-bearing medium.andM;For now, however, &quot;groupware&quot; remains a folk term expressing the hope that,through some new type of software, networks will become a great utilityrather than another technological disappointment (like PCs used as high-techtypewriters and/or sitting idle as status symbols).andP;  Misused, these networkscould make more noise than music.andM;What special good can we expect from computer networks?andP;  Because networks canconnect people, each in his own place of work, we can for the first time usePCs to address group work--and that presents a historic opportunity toimprove overall organizational productivity.andM;According to many studies, more than 75% of a white collar worker's time isspent interacting with other people--and that figure does not include thetime for &quot;telephone tag&quot; or other preparations for getting together.andM;Theoretically, it should be possible to drive a PC-network by the &quot;logic&quot; ofour work relationships, making information flow between people when and whereit matters and preventing it from flowing when and where that matters.andP;  Thus,people's work--whether alone or together--will become productive by improvedcontext and timing.andM;If this can be achieved, each person would have a highly tailored,PC-supported environment, with continued support throughout the day, fullyintegrated with the telephone and other media.andM;Many people today feel that computers tend to degrade the value ofinformation by context-free, ill-timed volumes of output.andP;  The possibility weare discussing could reverse this trend.andP;  Sensitive to context and timing,networked PCs could enhance the value of information beyond today's fondestdreams.andM;With information personally more valuable, people would use their PCs more,greatly increasing the utility of individual PCs, thus raising itsutilization far above the meager 6% average of today.andM;For the organization as a whole, more people interacting means a dramaticincrease in opportunities for creativity and innovation that can lead to astep-function increase in productivity.andP;  What's missing to make the dreamcome true?andP;  A new software technology.andM;It must become possible to express a network of work relationships amongpeople so as to control a network of machines.andP;  Today's software technologyis not up to this task: the results are too static; the forms of expressionare too remote from the objective; the modules don't combine as required.andM;Ambitious?andP;  Yes, but it can be done.andM;Some of us are now working on such new software technology.andP;  The results willbe &quot;true groupware,&quot; in the sense that they address coordination, not justsolitary work and message-sending.andP;  Eventually, groupware in this sense willdominate computing as a whole.andM;Paradoxically, making the personal computer less personal through networkingwill turn it into a real extension of a person.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
