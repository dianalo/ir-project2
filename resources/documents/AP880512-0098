(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Train crewmen involved in a fiery Conrail crashsuffered from lack of sleep and could have unwittingly dozed offwhile still performing basic duties, an expert on work schedulessaid today.   Donald I. Tepas, an industrial psychologist from the Universityof Connecticut, reviewed the six men's hours for the NationalTransportation Safety Board investigation into the Jan. 14 accident.   Two Conrail trains, one hauling coal and the other haulingtrailer-vans, smashed head-on at Thompsontown, killing the engineerand the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives.Damage was estimated at $5 million.   ``After examining the work schedules of the crew membersinvolved in the Thompsontown accident, I'm quite comfortable inconcluding that many or all of the crew members involved weresuffering from chronic sleep deprivation,'' Tepas said in remarksprepared for an NTSB hearing today.   ``A normal manifestation of this state is brief or extendedperiods of sleep, some of which workers themselves may not be awareof.''   During such periods, he said, people can react to signalspresented to them.   The industrial psychologist blamed erratic work schedules;harsh, monotonous work environments, and a failure to instructworkers in dealing with fatigue.   ``Given current approaches to rail operations and the use ofhuman resources, there is little doubt in my mind that rail crewsoften fall asleep on the job,'' he said.   During the opening day of testimony Wednesday, neither of thetwo survivors said they received any warning before the head-oncollision or saw or heard the other train approaching.   Donald L. Hull, conductor on the train carrying thetrailer-vans, testified the accident occurred when a dispatcherswitched his train to another track before receiving a signal thatthe coal train had stopped.   Hull, a 35-year Conrail veteran, said there are no strict rulesfor the dispatcher to go by.   James Nearhoof, the dispatcher, testified that he had perceivedno indication that one of the trains had gone through a stop signal.   Jerry L. Haselbarth, 33, the conductor of the coal train, saidhe received a report from Rockville Police on the day of the wreckthat the train's rear brakes were sticking. He then stopped thetrain and corrected the situation.   Shortly before the accident, Hull said he felt the traindecelerate rapidly, but he does not remember anyone applying theemergency brakes.   Hull said he then saw the brakeman on his train, Charles S.DeSantis, fall from the lead locomotive.   ``I knew something was wrong,'' he said. ``It all happened sofast, it didn't register that we were hitting anyone. I thoughteverything was caving in. I was just holding on.''   Toxicology tests showed a small amount of marijuana present inHaselbarth's urine, but he testified he was not under the influenceof drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash.   Throughout the hearing, questions arose on the amount of sleeprail workers get before they must report for duty.   Hull reported that he had had about 4{ hours of sleep beforebeginning his shift on the day of the accident.   Haselbarth said he thought he had slept for just one or twohours the night before he reported to work for the fatal run, butadded he felt rested from the previous night's sleep.   ``The railroad has complete, 100 percent control of your life.You don't,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
