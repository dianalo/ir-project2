An exception is the cost of treating asbestos. However,the panel ruled that for most other cleanup costs, companiesmust use so-called expensing, rather than longer-termcapitalizing, which can offer some immediate advantages tothe bottom line.</LP><TEXT>   Many companies had been watching for a decision on theenvironmental accounting issue, reached recently by theEmerging Issues Task Force of the Financial AccountingStandards Board. The FASB, located in Norwalk, Conn., is thechief rulemaking body for accountants.   The task force addresses narrower issues than the FASB,but its decisions are applicable to any company followinggenerally accepted accounting principles.   Questions about whether companies could capitalizeenvironmental treatment costs arose after the task forceagreed last October that a company's costs to handle asbestosproblems may be capitalized if the treatment increases therealizable value of the property.   &quot;The asbestos conclusion was the springboard of the wholeissue,&quot; says Gregory Jonas, a partner in accountingprinciples at Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., which brought the latestissue before the task force.   Capitalizing a cost on the books gives a company theadvantage of spreading the cost over a longer period, thusenhancing the bottom line in the near term. Expensing a costis a one-time event. In the past, there was a diversity amongcompanies about whether to expense or to capitalize thesecosts, says George Schleier of the FASB staff. The decisiondoesn't address tax issues.   &quot;Basically, what the consensus does is it makes it verydifficult to capitalize the cleanup costs other than in apurchase transaction where you buy property and improve it&quot;or in removal of asbestos, says Don Nicolaisen, nationaldirector of accounting services at Price Waterhouse, and atask force member. Costs of improvements, such as installingpollution-control equipment, that prevent futurecontamination also may be capitalized.   But Mr. Nicolaisen and others on the task force say thatalthough companies were given greater discretion tocapitalize costs relating to asbestos cleanup than otherenvironmental contamination, the distinction between the twoisn't all that clear cut.   &quot;The essential distinction is between something thatarises in use, as opposed to something that existed when itwas built or at the time of purchase,&quot; says Bernard Doyle, aconsultant in corporate accounting at General Electric Co.,who also sits on the task force. &quot;It's not a perfectsolution, but it seemed to be a reasonable distinction tomake,&quot; Mr. Doyle says, noting that asbestos was put in mostbuildings as an improvement, whereas much other environmentalcontamination is a by-product of industrial processes.   The environmental consensus &quot;provides a framework forcompanies to support a decision to capitalize,&quot; says JohnGribble, a member of the FASB staff. Mr. Gribble cites theexample of a company cleaning up a toxic waste dump on itsproperty. In the past, a company might have argued forcapitalizing the cost because cleaning it up improves it. Butunder the consensus on issue 90-8, &quot;all you've done isrestore the land to its original state,&quot; so the cost shouldbe expensed, he says.   Mr. Gribble notes that &quot;asbestos is a strange bird becauseof its dangerous nature.&quot; He distinguishes it from othercontaminants by saying that its &quot;mere existence could beconsidered to mean a building is unsafe.&quot;   Others aren't so sure about the distinction. &quot;I have ahard time believing it (asbestos) is any more dangerous thanany of the other things that are out there,&quot; such as toxicwaste, says Robert F. Richter, a partner in the nationalaccounting and auditing department at Laventhol andamp; Horwath.&quot;There is a difference, but I don't think it goes as far asthey have stretched it,&quot; says Jay C. Agarwal, vice president,technology assessment, at Charles River Associates, aconsulting firm. Mr. Agarwal says the difference is betweenaccumulated danger and continued danger. Some argue thatleaving asbestos in place doesn't create as much of a hazardas disturbing it when it is removed.   The accounting decision doesn't address when to recognizeliabilities related to environmental contamination or how tomeasure them, &quot;a bigger problem by far,&quot; says Edward Murphy,director of finance, accounting and statistics at theAmerican Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C. Companiesare attempting to assess their liability, but &quot;it's ahorrendous task,&quot; Mr. Murphy says.   General guidance on when to record a liability forcleaning up these problems is given in the FASB's statementfive. That says the latest you can record a liability forsomething like an oil spill is &quot;when you write the check andthe earliest is when you find out about it,&quot; says Mr. Jonasof Arthur Andersen. Liabilities should be recorded as soon asa company is reasonably certain one exists and that it'sreasonably quantifiable, says Mr. Murphy. But, says Mr.Nicolaisen of Price Waterhouse, the whole issue of measuringthe liability &quot;is still an evolving process.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
