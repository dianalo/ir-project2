About 500 students at Dongguk University in Seoul fought policewith rocks and firebombs, demanding the release of the student, ImSu-kyong.

Miss Im was arrested on Aug 15 and faces the death penalty ifconvicted of charges she consorted with North Korean intelligenceagents.   At Yonsei University, also in Seoul, 200 students blocked trafficon a main street in front of their school for an hour, shouting``Release Miss Im!'' While riot police watched, students unfurled alarge banner reading ``Abolish national security laws.''   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 1,000 students occupied asection of a railway near Chosun University and delayed an outboundpassenger train for 35 minutes, the Yonhap News Agency said.

In Taegu, President Roh Tae-woo's hometown 175 miles southeast ofSeoul, 200 student radicals fought police with rocks and firebombsfor one hour before dispersing voluntarily. They also demanded MissIm's release.   Friday's clashes followed a government announcement accusingNorth Korea of manipulating dissident movements in South Koreathrough its organizations in Europe, Australia and the United States.   The Agency for National Security Planning, the main governmentintelligence organization, said Miss Im's illegal trip to NorthKorea in July resulted from the North's manipulation.   North Korea, the agency said, mobilized several pro-communistKorean organizations in the United States, West Germany andAustralia to get a South Korean radical student group to send adelegate to the world youth festival in the North Korean capital ofPyongyang in July.   The festival was July 1-8.   Miss Im was arrested when she returned to the South Aug. 15. Sheis charged with other violations ranging from receiving money fromCommunist agents to going to the North under Communist orders. Iffound guilty on all charges, she could be sentenced to death.   Radical students regard the South Korean government as adictatorship supported by the United States and are demanding thewithdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South.   South Korean bans unauthorized trips to North Korea, an enemycountry since the division of the Korean Peninsula in 1945. TheNorth invaded the South to start the 1950-53 Korean War, and a peacetreaty was never signed.</TEXT></DOC>
