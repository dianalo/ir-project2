(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has ruled that a lawsuit may go totrial to determine if any subliminal messages on a heavy metal JudasPriest album led to a suicide pact between two Reno youths.   Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead ruled Wednesday thatsubliminal messages don't enjoy First Amendment rights of freedom ofspeech because they are aimed at the subconscious.   Whitehead said he found it difficult to accept that any expertcould say the suicides were triggered by alleged subliminal messageson the British band's ``Stained Class'' album. But he said the issueshould be decided by a jury.   ``The court concludes it must allow the public to decide theseimportant and unique issues after a full hearing and must notinterpose its own personal opinions,'' Whitehead said.   Previously, in similar lawsuits filed across the country, judgeshave dismissed cases after ruling that artistic messages areprotected by the First Amendment. But courts have not spoken to theissue of subliminal messages.   The lawsuit was filed by the families of the two youths _ one whodied immediately after shooting himself with a shotgun in December1985 and the other who died three years later of from complicationsof his injuries.   Raymond Belknap, then 17, and James Vance, then 19, shotthemselves in a school playground after sharing a 12-pack of beer,smoking marijuana and listening to ``Stained Class'' in Belknap'sbedroom for several hours.   In a deposition taken before he died, Vance said the musicconvinced them the answer to life was death.   Experts hired by attorneys for the youths' families havesubmitted reports claiming the subliminal message ``do it, do it''can be heard buried in the album recorded by CBS Records in the1970s.   The defendants, CBS Records and Judas Priest, have stronglydenied there were any subliminal messages in the album.</TEXT></DOC>
