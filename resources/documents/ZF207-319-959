has its limitations, it will allowmany developers to speed their programs up considerably.andM;Brian Molyneaux, Heizer's product manager for CompileIt!, said that handlersthat use integer arithmetic and repeat loops will undergo considerable speedincreases.andP;  CompileIt! also protects code from accidental modification or useby others.andM;There are persistent rumors, too, that HyperTalk creator Dan Winkler isworking on methods to speed up HyperTalk.andP;  Whether this takes the form of abuilt-in compiler or a method of storing &quot;tokenized&quot; scripts (instead ofcurrent character-based scripts) is still unclear.andM;HyperCard is still an evolving program.andP;  As Apple releases new versions ofthe program, and as third parties create HyperCard-like orHyperCard-compatible programs as well as new tools for extending HyperTalk,HyperTalk will also evolve.andP;  In its first year, it has brought programmingpower to many who would not otherwise have bothered.andP;  As HyperTalk matures,it should attract even more users to progrmaming.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
