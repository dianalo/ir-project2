The agreement to allow a third assembly shift at theBramalea, Ontario, plant in Canada is expected to giveChrysler the capacity to make as many as 60,000 of the sedanseach year in addition to the 260,000 that can be produced ina standard two-shift operation. Chrysler officials said theyare &quot;a couple of weeks&quot; away from signing a pact with theCanadian Auto Workers union permitting the additional shift.</LP><TEXT>   The plant isn't scheduled to start building the cars,code-named LH, until June 1992, and it isn't clear whetherconsumer demand will require three shifts. But theflexibility of a third-shift option could be crucial toChrysler.   The LH models, the first truly new cars the company hasdeveloped in a decade, are considered as vital to thecompany's future now as the smaller K-cars were in the early1980s.   In fact, most of the company's efforts these days areaimed at conserving resources while awaiting next year'sdebut of the LH models and new Jeeps code-named ZJ. Chryslerofficials have said the company may sell $500 million inassets to counter losses this year from weak sales andcontinuing expenditures for new products.   So far, though, Chrysler hasn't found any takers for itsproperties, which include part of its financial-servicesunit, half of its 50% stake in the U.S. assembly plant itruns with Mitsubishi Motors Corp., its 93.9 millionMitsubishi Motors shares and some businesses operated by itsAcustar parts-making subsidiary. Chrysler is continuing talkswith prospective buyers.   The negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union,however, were more immediately fruitful. Chrysler officialssaid they reached a &quot;framework for an agreement&quot; in talkswith the Canadian union yesterday in Windsor, Ontario.   The company and union also discussed adding a third shiftat Chrysler's Windsor minivan plant, although talks on thatissue aren't as advanced.   Last year, Chrysler accepted a costly new contract withthe United Auto Workers union in the U.S. in return for theright to operate a third shift at its St. Louis minivanplant. But because of the weak automotive market, Chryslerisn't expected to start the additional shift until early nextyear.   A Chrysler spokesman declined to say how many additionaljobs the third shift would bring to the Bramalea plant. Thefacility, which builds the slow-selling Eagle Premier andDodge Monaco, currently has about 850 hourly employees. It isscheduled to add almost all of the 1,000 hourly workers whowere idled last July when Chrysler closed the nearbyBrampton, Ontario, Jeep plant.   Chrysler isn't alone in moving to squeeze more productionfrom existing plants. General Motors Corp. has beennegotiating with the UAW to use a three-crew work schedule atits Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant, which builds theChevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird cars. GM already usesa similar system in some of its European assembly plants, asdo other auto makers in Europe.   ---   Larry M. Greenberg in Toronto contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
