One commenton the proposal was received from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).OMB took exception to one of the routine use disclosures included in thenotice. The disclosure at issue, routine use (7) in the notice publishedon August 17, 1988, provides for disclosures to the auditors, investigators,and other authorized employees of the Department's Office of InspectorGeneral.
