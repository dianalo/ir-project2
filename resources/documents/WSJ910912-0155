The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, marks thefirst time that Drexel has officially blamed Mr. Milken forthe problems that led to the company's near demise. Mr.Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, who also worked in Drexel'sjunk-bond department is named as a co-defendant in the suit.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, demands thereturn of $1 billion in compensation paid to Michael Milkenbetween 1985 and 1989 and reimbursement for legal expensesthe company paid in initially defending the Milken brothers.Drexel also asked that the Milkens be held liable for $650million in fines and civil penalties Drexel agreed to pay in1989 to settle government suits against the company.   Separately, thrift regulators asked a federal judge toorder Michael Milken to turn over detailed information abouthis financial status and compensation in recent years. Theyalso accused Mr. Milken of destroying evidence to hide hisassets. In May, Mr. Milken's attorneys rejected the requestfor documents as &quot;overly broad {and} unduly burdensome.&quot;   Mark Belnick, an attorney for Mr. Milken, said allrelevant financial documents have been turned over to thriftregulators. He also denied that Mr. Milken destroyed anydocuments. &quot;That's a lot of bunk,&quot; he said. &quot;To say that hedestroyed documents is absolutely outrageous.&quot;   Mr. Milken initially denied any wrongdoing when thegovernment began investigating Drexel's junk-bond department,but he pleaded guilty last year to six felony counts relatedto securities transactions. He is serving a 10-year prisonsentence. As part of Mr. Milken's plea agreement, thegovernment agreed not to prosecute Lowell Milken, who was oneof his brother's top lieutenants in the junk-bond department.   Drexel pleaded guilty in early 1989 to criminal chargesand settled a suit filed by the Securities and ExchangeCommission. The company, facing a liquidity crisis almost oneyear later, filed for bankruptcy-law protection fromcreditors in February 1990 and closed most of its operations.   In the new suit, Drexel said, &quot;Relying on the Milkenbrothers' representations of their innocence and unaware ofthe defendants' concealment of their wrongdoing, {Drexel}defended the brothers' conduct at an enormous cost in legalexpenses, lost opportunities, and eventually lost credibilityand reputation when the facts became known.&quot;   Drexel said in the suit that, had it known of thewrongdoing in its junk-bond department, the company &quot;wouldhave stopped the illegal activities, dismissed {the Milkens},and wouldn't have paid {them} the enormous sums which theyreceived.&quot;   The suit accuses the Milkens of violating the company'spolicy on insider trading, stock manipulation and secretlyprofiting from Drexel-related transactions. It also portraysthe Milkens as operators of a rogue department within thecompany, recruiting employees to violate company policies andjoin the alleged illegal scheme.   Most of the details in the suit come from Michael Milken'sguilty plea and a pre-sentencing hearing held last fall. Thesuit was brought on Drexel's behalf by Cravath, Swaine andamp;Moore, which represented thrift regulators in the Drexelbankruptcy-law case. On behalf of regulators, Cravath hasfiled two additional suits accusing Mr. Milken of defraudingsavings and loans.   A spokesman for Drexel said the suit primarily addresses&quot;activities which have been admitted by Michael Milken. Thecompany and its {creditors} believe they are owed redress asa result of these breaches of fiduciary obligations.&quot;   David Boies, a partner at Cravath handling the case, said,&quot;Up until now, there have been lots of people on the outsidesaying Michael Milken committed these crimes and should paydamages. Now you've got the people on the inside, the companyhe worked for, saying, `Yes, that's true.'&quot;   Another attorney for Mr. Milken, Alan Dershowitz, deniedthe allegations and said Drexel was trying to make the formerjunk-bond official a scapegoat for the company's own poorbusiness decisions. He said Drexel had condoned theactivities in the junk-bond department that the company nowclaims Mr. Milken concealed.   Mr. Milken &quot;was the goose that laid the golden egg -- eggafter egg after egg. It's unappreciative,&quot; Mr. Dershowitzsaid.   In a statement, Mr. Dershowitz added that the suit &quot;standstruth on its head by conjuring up legal theories to suepeople on behalf of a company for activities that the companyapproved, encouraged and profited from enormously.&quot; He addedthat Mr. Milken plans to countersue &quot;those responsible forthe losses for which he is being blamed.&quot;   Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken, alsodenied the allegations, which he called &quot;nothing more thanunsupported and malicious innuendo.&quot;   In federal court in Los Angeles, U.S. regulators filed anamended complaint in one of their two lawsuits against Mr.Milken. The suit adds more detailed allegations accusing Mr.Milken and his subordinates at Drexel of bribing savings andloan officials to take part in the alleged scheme tomanipulate junk-bond trading. Regulators claim that thethrifts' investments were manipulated by Mr. Milken to createthe illusion of demand for the securities. Mr. Milken hasdenied the allegations.   For instance, the amended suit said that Columbia Savingsandamp; Loan Association was brought into the scheme after theMilken group arranged for the thrift's former head, ThomasSpiegel, to take part in lucrative transactions involvingDrexel. In return, Mr. Spiegel caused Columbia, which failedearlier this year, to buy unsuitable junk bonds at inflatedprices, the suit said.   The suit said Mr. Spiegel personally made a profit of morethan $7 million in 1988, for example, by investing $132,000in a Milken-arranged partnership that held interests in thebuy-out of Storer Communications Inc.   Also as a favor to Mr. Spiegel, the suit alleged, Mr.Milken and a Columbia subsidiary formed a partnership to buya Gulfstream aircraft and build a lavish airplane hangar atVan Nuys airport in California. The suit said the planefrequently was used to fly Mr. Spiegel and the Milkenbrothers to Jackson Hole, Wyo., where Columbia owned severalluxurious condominiums. One of the condominiums wasdesignated for use by the Milken families, the suit said.   Attorneys for Mr. Spiegel, who also is a defendant in thesuit, couldn't be reached for comment. Between 1982 and 1989,Columbia bought more than $9.8 billion in Drexel-underwrittenjunk bonds, making it one of Drexel's biggest customers.Regulators have estimated that the thrift's bailout couldcost $1.5 billion.   ---   JUDGE RULES FOR ABC and Geraldo Rivera in libel suit.   The 10-year-old suit was brought by a convicted felon whowas called a &quot;hitman&quot; on the the network's news program&quot;20-20.&quot;   U.S. District Court Judge Charles Joiner granted a motionto end the case in favor of Mr. Rivera and ABC following fourdays of testimony by witnesses for the plaintiff. The judgestopped the trial prior to the presentation of thedefendants's case.   &quot;They had to prove, or at least present some evidence,that we failed to act with reasonable care. There was noevidence,&quot; said Elizabeth Rader, a lawyer withCleveland-based law firm Squire, Sanders andamp; Dempsey, whichrepresented ABC, a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Theother defendants in the case were Charles Thompson, aproducer, and Maravilla Productions Inc.   John L. Wolfe, an Akron, Ohio, attorney for the plaintiff,William G. Brooks, said, &quot;We are seriously consideringappealing.&quot; Mr. Wolfe said his client was defamed in theprogram, which ran in April 1980.   Mr. Brooks is serving a 19-to-30-year prison term for aconviction unrelated to the allegations in the &quot;20-20&quot;broadcast.   The story, called &quot;Injustice for All,&quot; concerned a probatejudge convicted in 1980 on a sexual misconduct charge. Mr.Brooks pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in that case.   ---   MORE SUITS FILED against Nutri/System.   A Miami attorney who has been pursuing medical claimsagainst Nutri/System Inc. said he filed 120 additional suitsagainst the company, alleging that the plaintiffs sufferedgallbladder damage after following the company's dietprogram.   The attorney, Robert Fiore, said seven of the new caseswere filed on behalf of teen-agers, and that the total numberof cases filed against the Blue Bell, Penn., company in statecourt in Miami is 191.   Bert Bauman, a New York lawyer, said he filed 18 similarsuits against Nutri/System in federal court in Manhattanearlier this week.   In a prepared statement, Nutri/System accused Mr. Fiore of&quot;calculated sensationalism,&quot; and said there is no reliableevidence linking the company's diet program to gallbladderdisease. Nutri/System says obesity is a major cause ofgallbladder disease, but Mr. Fiore said the disease is rarein teen-agers.   Last month, a district court judge in Louisiana dismisseda gallbladder suit against Nutri/System brought by a womanwho was 84 years old when she entered the program.   Five of Mr. Fiore's cases are scheduled to go to trial inMiami Oct. 15.   ---   NOTED: Three partners have joined the Washington office ofReid andamp; Priest, a New York-based law firm with more than 200lawyers.
