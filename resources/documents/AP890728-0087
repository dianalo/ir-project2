Walker suggested Friday.   Walker, ranking Republican on the House Science, Space andTechnology Committee, said that such a tax incentive would be oneway for the United States to maintain world leadership in spaceduring an era when the federal budget may be unable to finance suchresearch.   ``If you told manufacturers that if you develop a product inspace and bring it back to Earth and sell it, then you can marketit for 10 years tax free'' it would encourage industry to invest inspace research, Walker said at a breakfast for reporters.   ``It would cost us (the federal government) absolutely nothingto give this kind of incentive'' because there currently are nosuch products being made and sold, the Pennsylvania Republican said.   Walker said the tax incentive is one way for the nation toencourage the development of research and manufacturing in spacewithout the government having to finance all of the effort.   He said there already are ideas that could be researched inorbit, but companies are reluctant to make the high investmentrequired. For instance, said Walker, a firm in Pennsylvania hasproposed a plan to grown human nerve tissue in orbit and thenreturn it Earth where it could be transplanted into humans withoptic nerve blindness.   Walker said the nerve tissue cannot be grown on Earth becausegravity distorts the cell structure. But in the weightlessness oforbit this is not a problem.   Industry, he said, also could be encouraged to develop newbooster rockets if the government, particularly the military, wouldassure manufacturers that commercial launch services would be usedto put NASA and Air Force satellites into orbit.   Such assurances, said Walker, could lead to the commercialdevelopment of what he called ``a big, dumb booster'' _ a simple,but powerful, rocket, built with current technology, that could putlarge satellites into orbit routinely.   He said that instead of encouraging the commercial production ofsimple ``big, dumb booster'' rockets, the military and NASA areattempting to persuade Congress to finance new generations ofrockets that would require government-financed development.</TEXT></DOC>
