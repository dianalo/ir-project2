(Products).andO;Product:   Superbase (Data base management system) (Computer programs)Chart Builder (Add-in/on software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationAdd-In/On SoftwareGraphics SoftwareCharts.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Superbase 2 and 4 are two of the few database managers currently runningunder Windows 3.0.andP;  But what's a database without charts and graphs to gowith the reports? Chart Builder, from Pinnacle Publishing, is a Superbaseadd-on that lets you produce great-looking graphs from Superbase databases.andO;It's made up of three components:andM;* A set of Superbase objects (files, forms, and data manipulation language(DML) programs) that build and store the chart definitionsandM;* The Graphics Server, which is the underlying graphics engineandM;* A dynamic link library (DLL) which acts as the interface between Superbaseand the Graphics ServerandM;Chart Builder is easily installed (a simple batch file is provided-too bad itdoesn't run in Windows).andP;  With Chart Builder you can create pie, line, bar,log/lin, high low close, and area charts.andP;  The DML portion of Chart Builderprovides the interface to those files.andP;  The interface is simple, easy to use,and looks great! The graph definitions are grouped together as part of aproject,&quot; and the project stored as a Superbase file.andP;  The records of eachproject file include the parameters that define each graph in that project.andM;You define the parameters on which the graph is to be built (like the X and Yaxes of a bar chart).andP;  You can define up to six fields in a graph and thefield on which the data is to be grouped.andP;  You can use a filter to eliminateunwanted data.andM;After defining the basics, you can add titles, legends, values, and categorylabels.andP;  However, you can't place unattached text on the chart, nor can youcontrol the placement of the legend or other titles.andP;  This is a majorlimitation-users have little control over the ultimate look of the chart.andO;The components of the chart aren't independent objects that you can move,resize, etc.andM;You can also choose from a variety of graph styles.andP;  The available stylesdepend on the type of chart.andP;  For example, if you're using a bar chart, youcan only choose from stacked, stacked percentile, clustered, etc.andP;  You cancontrol a few other aspects of the display, like whether a grid is includedor whether the bars are displayed in two dimensions or three.andP;  Each graph hasa different set of options.andM;You can display the chosen chart on screen or print it.andP;  Unfortunately, youcan't select screen or printer fonts for the labels, and you can't choosecolors or patterns for different data categories-it's done automatically.andO;This wouldn't normally be grounds for a complaint, but working in Windows(with Superbase), users come to expect this kind of flexibility and control.andM;When the chart is displayed on screen, it appears in its own window, whichcan be re-sized, moved, or shown as an icon.andP;  The only hang-up is that youcan't do anything else in Superbase while the chart is displayed-you have tohit a key to remove the &quot;focus&quot; from the chart window.andP;  There's an extremelyhandy option on the chart window's control menu that copies the data onto theclipboard.andP;  This makes transferring charts to Windows-based word processors asnap.andM;There are two important features I'd like to see in future releases.andP;  I wishChart Builder was designed so users could watch the chart change as theunderlying data changes.andP;  I also wish Pinnacle Publishing would providedevelopers with hooks into their graphics server, so developers could includegraphs in their applications.andP;  Unfortunately, when Chart Builder is running,it &quot;monopolizes&quot; the Superbase environment.andM;For developers and power users, there's an alternative to an add-on likeChart Builder: You can export data to a Windows-based graphing application orspreadsheet.andP;  This can be done interactively through Superbase's exportfacility or programmed using Windows' dynamic data exchange (DDE).andM;Overall, Chart Builder is a nice add on.andP;  It provides functionality thatSuperbase users will appreciate.andP;  It has an excellent interface and it's easyto use.andP;  Unfortunately, many users may find this version (1.0) rather limitedbased on their experience with other Windows applications.andP;  Chart Builder ispriced at $199.andM;Pinnacle Publishing, inc.andM;28621 Pacific Highway So.andM;Federal Way, WA 98003andM;(800) 231-1293andM;(206) 941-2300</TEXT></DOC>
