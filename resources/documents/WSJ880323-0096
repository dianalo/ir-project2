CNW, the parent of the Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co., said it exhausted negotiation procedures under the federal Railway Labor Act and it plans to unilaterally cut its crew size April 22. Under federal railroad law, the union is free to strike in retaliation.    The development has far-reaching implications for the railroad industry, which is seeking to eliminate thousands of jobs to lower its costs and become more competitive with the trucking industry. Other railroads may follow the lead of the Chicago andamp; North Western, the nation's ninth-largest railroad, if it succeeds in unilaterally changing its work rules.    But by pressing the issue, the Chicago andamp; North Western also could trigger a strike that could spread throughout the industry. Under federal railroad law, the union is allowed to extend picketing to other railroads, turning a local dispute into a national issue and inviting federal intervention. A spokesman for the union declined to comment on its plans.    The Chicago andamp; North Western is preparing for a strike. A spokesman said the company's 1,000 management employees are being trained to operate the railroad, which hauls freight on 6,500 miles of track between Chicago and Omaha, Neb., and between Deluth, Minn., and Kansas City, Mo., and operates a 200-mile coal route in Wyoming. In addition, the company has lined up replacement employees with previous railroad experience to work in the event of a strike, the spokesman said.    CNW wants to cut the size of crews on its freight trains to two from four or five. The company claims that technological advances have made the jobs of two brakemen on each crew obsolete. By eliminating the jobs of 1,150 brakemen, the company said it can save $53 million annually.    The union so far has proposed only work-rule changes that the company claims will cost an additional $5 million annually.    CNW stated its intention to cut the crew size a year ago. When its negotiators failed to reach an agreement with the union last July, the company requested the help of the National Mediation Board.    The company said the board terminated its effort to resolve the dispute after the union indicated it was unwilling to enter arbitration. That triggered a 30-day waiting period, after which CNW is free to cut its crew size. </TEXT></DOC>
