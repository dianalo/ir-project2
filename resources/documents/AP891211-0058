President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, also facing pressure fromhard-line Communists, angrily offered to resign as party leaderafter criticism of his overtures to the West, said a member of theparty's policy-making Central Committee who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Sakharov and several other parliamentarians on Sunday urged thenational strike to pressure the Congress of People's Deputies tovote on rescinding Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, whichguarantees the Communists the ``leading and guiding role'' insociety. They also want the Congress, which opens Tuesday, to acton several key reform laws.   Sakharov's group failed to win the support of 400 progressiveparliamentarians. The InterRegional Group voted Sunday to favor thegoal of rescinding Communist supremacy but did not back the strike.Members said the public mood was too explosive.   Strikes have ravaged the struggling Soviet economy since lastsummer. Consumers are angry over shortages of food and consumergoods, and officials now warn that city-supplied steam heat couldbe affected by a coal strike in the depths of an already bitterRussian winter.   On the streets of the capital today it was business as usual.Stores and transport operated and no pickets were in evidence.   However, 214 of the 500 researchers at the Academy of Sciences'geography institute in Moscow stopped their scientific studies fortwo hours, said Galina Koslovsky, an interpreter for the institute.They spent the time writing a resolution supporting the deputies'call for a vote on Article 6 and critical economic reforms, thensent the text to the Kremlin before returning to work.   In Latvia, some store clerks and transport workers heeded theLatvian Popular Front's call to show solidarity with Sakharov'scall through a work stoppage of 15 minutes, said Maris Melans ofAtmoda, the Popular Front newspaper.   The Soviet Communist Party is facing unprecedented challenges toits monopoly on power. The Lithuanian legislature voted last weekto eliminate the party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy inthat republic.   Estonians and Latvians voted for new city and regional councilmembers in elections viewed as a referendum on the Communist Partyand the independence of the two republics from Moscow. Communistofficials faced overwhelming defeat.   All three Baltic republics were annexed by the Kremlin in 1940.   The elections Sunday were the first in the Soviet Union toinclude candidates from de facto alternative political parties.First results were not expected until later today at the earliest.   In Moscow on Sunday, 5,000 people marched in sub-zerotemperatures in support of reformist lawmakers. Police did not stopthat protest, but they pushed several hundred others off PushkinSquare after speakers ripped up photographs of Gorbachev and Sovietfounder Vladimir Lenin.   Demonstrators chanted, ``Freedom! Freedom!'' as the helmetedriot police punched, shoved and kicked them. Tass said 20 peoplewere detained.   Boris Yeltsin, an unorthodox member of the 250-member CentralCommittee, told fellow reformers that Saturday's committee meetingwas dominated by conservatives complaining about Gorbachev'schanges.   A conservative Central Committee member, speaking Sunday oncondition of anonymity, said Gorbachev offered to resign afterKemerevo party chief Alexander Melnikov ``really let himself getcarried away and said something like this: `Is it proper to gobowing to the capitalists, to go asking a blessing from the Pope?'''   The source, who attended the meeting, said Gorbachev was irkedby the criticism of his moves to make peace with the West, andoffered to step down if the full committee agreed with Melnikov.   Other members immediately voiced support for Gorbachev andMelnikov apologized, the source said.   Gorbachev warned that the situation in the Soviet Union is``unbelievably crucial,'' according to the transcript of his speechcarried by Tass.   ``The Soviet people do not want to put up with the fact that ata time when the normal rhythm of life has been broken, their localand national leaders are often doing nothing,'' he said.   Gorbachev said he was willing to accept a change in theCommunist Party's constitutional guarantee of supremacy, but notimmediately, Tass said. He said it should come only as part ofsweeping constitutional reforms.   Gorbachev cited the nation's serious economic troubles inarguing that the second session of the Congress of People'sDeputies, which begins Tuesday, must concentrate on economicreforms and not veer off into a discussion of constitutional issues.</TEXT></DOC>
