In a scenario that could be repeated by other financial firms as well, Financial Corp. had to compensate for declines in the value of the securities because they had been pledged as collateral for borrowings.    Financial Corp. owns about $17.4 billion of mortgage-backed securities and had pledged about $12 billion of them as collateral for short-term borrowings known as reverse repurchase agreements. When the value of those securities fell, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp., parent of American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's largest thrift, had to put up nearly $900 million of cash and additional collateral.    In a reverse repurchase agreement, a borrower such as Financial Corp. sells securities to a bank or securities dealer and receives cash equal to about 95% of the value of the securities. The borrower agrees to buy back the securities on a certain date, usually within 30 days, for a price that reflects interest on the funds and agrees to put up more collateral or repay part of the loan if the value of the securities falls.    William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., said the company met the collateral calls easily. &quot;We handled the runup in rates very well. We could have handled another week of this kind of debacle, with cash to spare.&quot;    However, the drop of as much as 9% in the mortgage-backed securities market before a partial recovery late last week points up some of the risks inherent in Financial Corp.'s current strategy of loading up on fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities.    The unrealized losses in some thrifts' mortgage-backed securities portfolios are estimated at as much as 6%. Mr. Popejoy said Financial Corp.'s position was largely protected by options hedges and declined to estimate the company's unrealized losses.    Jonathan Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., estimated that the rise in interest rates between March 31 and April 16 depressed the value of Financial Corp.'s mortgage-backed securities portfolio by $448 million.    Mr. Popejoy declined to discuss Mr. Gray's estimate or similar ones by competing thrift executives. &quot;We don't mark our protfolio to market, so I don't know how to intelligently respond to that,&quot; Mr. Popejoy said. Thrifts aren't required to write the value of mortgage-backed securities up or down with market fluctuations.    Mr. Popejoy said Financial Corp. also bought mortgage-backed securities last Tuesday and Wednesday, when prices hit a low point. Because prices rose later in the week, such purchases could have offset some unrealized losses.    Still, executives of competing thrifts were quick to point out that any significant losses could have wiped out Financial Corp.'s relatively thin capital. The company's reported net worth, or assets minus liabilities, at year's end was $314 million, less than 1% of its assets of $34 billion and $1.1 billion short of the level required by federal thrift regulators.    The net worth of $314 million also is inflated because Financial Corp.'s assets include $1 billion of good will, or intangible assets created when Financial Corp. paid more for companies it acquired than the net value of their assets.    The market decline also occurred at a critical time for Financial Corp. because the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has actively been seeking a buyer or company to contribute capital to Financial Corp.    Meanwhile, Mr. Popejoy said he has been contacted by six potential buyers for Financial Corp., but said all inquiries and discussions have been &quot;extremely tentative.&quot;    Mr. Popejoy has declined to discuss the details of Financial Corp.'s hedging activities. The company's 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, indicates that most of its hedges are designed to protect against rising deposit costs rather than against price declines in mortgage-backed securities.    Without the hedges, Financial Corp. would be heavily exposed to rising interest rates on deposits. More than 93% of its assets are in long-term, fixed-rate loans and securities, whose interest payments won't rise with market rates. However, 80% of Financial Corp.'s deposits and borrowings -- about $26.3 billion -- mature in one year or less and will tend to rise with market rates, reducing the company's net interest income.    Using interest-rate swaps and financial futures and options, Financial Corp. has effectively shifted $10.7 billion of those liabilities into longer-term obligations. Most of that amount, however, has been shifted to maturities of three years or less. In an interest-rate swap, Financial Corp. exchanges floating-rate or short-term borrowings for longer-term, fixed-rate borrowings.    The total cost of the hedging activities last year was $53 million. Financial Corp. had net income of $95.4 million, or $2.25 a share last year.    In addition to the hedging activities, Financial Corp. hopes to reduce its vulnerability to rising interest rates by issuing more adjustable-rate mortgages. But its adjustable-rate originations so far have been limited. Last year, the company made only $517 million of adjustable-rate loans out of total real-estate loan originations of $4.62 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
