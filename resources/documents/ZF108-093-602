Box 58168, Santa Clara,CA 95052-8168; (408) 987-7000.andM;Version: 1.1.andM;Requires: Two 800K drives and System 6.0 or later; hard-disk driverecommended.andM;Application Size: 452K.andM;Compatibility: Mac Plus or later.andM;In just under two years, I've seen three packages called MacWrite, and thelatest version is by far the best.andP;  MacWrite II version 1.1 isn't a majorupgrade, but it does pack enough improvements and new features to earn thatextra half mouse I withheld when I looked at version 1.0 a few months ago.andM;Because this is essentially a minor upgrade, all my positive comments fromthe August 1989 review still apply.andP;  MacWrite II is an excellent program --it's easy to use, is powerful, and has a terrific interface.andP;  The mostsignificant negative aspects, thankfully, have been fixed.andM;MacWrite II version 1.0 was a dog on 68000-based machines, and that is theprimary reason it was denied a higher mouse rating.andP;  Formatting and scrollingspeeds are acceptable, but even an average typist can outtype the displaywithout too much effort.andP;  Version 1.1 has addressed the problem but nottotally conquered it.andP;  The display speed is much better, but the overall feelis still slightly sluggish.andP;  A fast typist (someone in the 80-word-per-minuterange or faster) working on a Mac Plus or SE could probably still outtype thescreen.andP;  This is a significant improvement, nonetheless, and considering theamount of screen information the program supports, it may be unrealistic toexpect anything faster.andM;But version 1.1's most significant improvement is Claris' adoption of anopen-hooks architecture that the publisher calls XTND.andP;  It lets the programuse DataViz's MacLinkPlus Translators (or any other developer's translatorsthat meet Claris' published specifications) directly from a pop-up menu.andO;Opening a foreign document or saving a file in a different format is easy:Just place the appropriate translator that comes with MacWrite II in aspecial folder in your System folder, and that tanslator will appear on apop-up menu in MacWrite II (adding the MacLinkPlus Translators requires aslightly different procedure -- you must put the MacLinkPlus Translators fileinto the same folder as MacWrite II).andP;  By taking this approach, MacWrite IIcan now read and write to as many different formats as you have translators(at last count, you could get more than 100 in Data Viz's MacLinkPlus setalone).andP;  This makes MacWrite II an excellent choice for companies that areusing PCs, Macs, and even mainframes.andM;Claris has also added several small but welcome refinements.andP;  For example,version 1.1 now has a Go to page option -- although surprisingly, it can't beaccessed with a menu command, but requires a Command-key combination or adouble click on the current page indicator (shades of Word 3.0!).andP;  You canalso now view the Font menu in the standard System font (Chicago) with anOption-select (the exact opposite of the way this is done in any otherprogram if you use Suitcase II), fractional widths are supported as apreference, and window settings are saved with a document.andM;MacWrite Ii still has a few minor annoying features, such as being able tosave a file to a differnt format only with the Save As command, an inflexiblespelling checker (I'd like to be able to turn the suggestions list off), andno &quot;keep lines together&quot; option to prevent paragraphs from being split acrosspages.andP;  But these are small quibbles.andP;  With its improved performance on68000-based Macs and the addition of its powerful translators, MacWrite II isan excellent balance of power and simplicity.andP;  It's a great choice, both forpeople in mixed environments and for anyone who wants a powerful, easy-to-useword processor and doesn't need the specialized features such as stylesheets, tables, and interapplication linking that Word 4.0 offers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
