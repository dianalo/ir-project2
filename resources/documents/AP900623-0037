Actress Cicely Tyson was host at a tribute to the wife ofapartheid fighter Nelson Mandela that included a performance bySweet Honey in the Rock, an acapella group known for liberationsongs.   At the end of three rousing numbers, Mrs. Mandela embraced eachof the group's six members.   Mrs. Mandela reiterated her request for support of warfare ifnegotiations with the white rulers of South Africa break down.   ``If talks fall apart and they very well might, we know you willbe there to take up arms with us,'' Mrs. Mandela told a sold-outcrowd of 2,000 at the tribute.   Her appearances in Brooklyn raised about $60,000 for the ANC,organizers said.   Among Mrs. Mandela's other separate activities was an appearanceon Phil Donahue's syndicated show that aired Friday in New York andother selected cities but will not be broadcast in the rest ofcountry until Monday.   Mrs. Mandela condemned ``necklacing,'' the killing of SouthAfrican government collaborators by lighting gasoline-soaked tiresaround their necks.   Mrs. Mandela has been quoted as having said at a 1986 rally inSouth Africa: ``With our boxes of matches and our necklaces, weshall liberate this country.''   She said the statement was ``reported completely out ofcontext'' and added, ``No sane person would ever approve of that.''   As for whether she approves of violence, Mrs. Mandela assertedthat ``We have no violence to renounce. The method used by theoppressor determines your own reaction.''</TEXT></DOC>
