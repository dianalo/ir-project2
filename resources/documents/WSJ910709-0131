Thisresolution enriches both collections, and creates a wholethat surpasses the sum of its parts.   The new galleries will house the museum's collection,including the Annenberg bequest, in well-proportioned,adjoining rooms that echo the &quot;beaux-arts&quot; design of thebuilding's 19th-century architecture. This design realizesabout 30% more hanging space than available in the existinggalleries, and for the first time the museum will be able todisplay its collection in a coherent, logical order,revealing the history and development of 19th-centurypainting through Impressionism and post-Impressionism.</LP><TEXT>   The Annenberg pictures will hang in three sequentialgalleries along the spine of a cluster of nine galleries. Theinterplay of the Annenberg paintings with the museum'sImpressionist art will be wellserved by the vantage onto thesurrounding gallery walls from the galleries housing theAnnenberg collection and vice versa. A visitor will be ableto stand in front of the Annenberg van Gogh &quot;Vase of Roses&quot;and still see the museum's van Gogh &quot;Irises&quot; alongside othervan Gogh paintings only a measured cadence away in theadjacent gallery. The same will hold true for the Cezannes,the Renoirs and the many other resonant groupings that drawthese two collections naturally together.   The graceful invitation, at the heart of the new design,to view the Annenberg paintings in the company of theirfellows in the existing collection was an important factor inAmbassador Annenberg's decision to bequeath his collection tothe Metropolitan.   Philippe De Montebello   Director   Metropolitan Museum of Art   New York   ---   (Editor's note: Ms. Rosenbaum had sought information aboutthe design of the new 19th-century European galleries, butwas told by a Met spokesman that the plans were not availablebecause they were still &quot;in the drawing stages.&quot;)   ---   I have had many letters and telephone messages fromfriends across the country registering their unhappiness withMs. Rosenbaum's article concerning my paintings and the factthat they will ultimately go to the Metropolitan Museum ofArt on my passing. Her article was needlessly unkind,inaccurate in some detail and questioned my character insuggesting that I would probably change my will before thepaintings ever got to the Met.   I take pride in my record of citizenship and it is noteasy for me to read such negative things about my activities,especially in The Wall Street Journal, a publication forwhich I have had great respect for many years.   Walter H. Annenberg   St. Davids, Pa.   ---   Ms. Rosenbaum proposes that Walter Annenberg change hiswill with respect to his gift of the Annenberg collection ofpaintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a longtimefriend of Ambassador Annenberg, I agree that he should changehis will. I propose that he add a provision that everyone inthe world is welcome to enjoy the Annenberg collection exceptMs. Rosenbaum, whose mean-spirited, misanthropic articleproves that no good deed goes unpunished.
