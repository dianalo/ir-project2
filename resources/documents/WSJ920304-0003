Mead was named president and chief executive officer,another sign of change occurring at the hotel chain since agroup of investors took control last summer.   Mr. Mead, 44 years old, former executive vice president offinance at Motel 6, succeeds Sam Barshop, 62, the companyfounder. Mr. Barshop, who signed a five-year employmentcontract with the company last year, remains chairman.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, La Quinta said that Francis P. Bissaillon,43, a 12-year La Quinta veteran who was named chief operatingofficer in July, resigned effective March 25. &quot;I just wantedto do something different,&quot; Mr. Bissaillon said in aninterview.   Mr. Barshop said yesterday that he hasn't been involved inthe day-to-day operations in several years, and &quot;this waswhat the company needed.&quot; He said the changes aren't relatedto the new board membership. However, others familiar withthe company contend that the appointment of Mr. Mead, who wasa partner in a large accounting firm before joining Motel 6in 1987, underscores the new board's impatience with changeat the once high-flying company. Last summer, three largeshareholders won half the company's board seats and almostimmediately removed anti-takeover measures.   Since then, Mr. Barshop has reduced his stake in thecompany to roughly 3%, from 12%, by selling the shares to thelarge shareholders. A group, including Thomas M. Taylor andmembers of the Bass family, now owns about 20% of La Quinta.An investment concern controlled by New Zealand financier SirRonald Brierley owns about 20%; GeoCapital Corp., aninvestment adviser, owns about 11.7%.</TEXT></DOC>
