STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Germany hopes to launch major neweconomic initiatives in the Soviet Union to cash in on ambitiousplans to overhaul its economy, officials said Tuesday.   A $1.6 billion West German credit to the Kremlin signed thisweek has buoyed optimism among businesses in this staunch NATO ally.   ``We believe that West Germany can play a leading role in makingmodernization possible in the Soviet Union,'' said Reinhard Krause,an Economics Ministry spokesman.   West Germany has long enjoyed good economic relations withMoscow, and remains its biggest Western trading partner despitedeclines in recent years.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms havefueled interest in establishing closer economic and political ties,Krause told The Associated Press.   Officials in Bonn see broadening opportunities for more jointventures and for increased West German participation in theconsumer and supply sectors.   West German firms are involved in 13 joint ventures in theSoviet Union, and 35 more are under negotiation.   ``The Soviet Union is clearly interested in quickly improvingthe quality of consumer services to its citizens,'' FinanceMinister Gerhard Stoltenberg said.   ``This is a political opportunity that could lead to many newcontracts with West German firms,'' Stoltenberg said after meetingwith industrialists in Berlin.   The West German enthusiasm in the economic sphere is matched bya growing positive public perception of Gorbachev and his reforms.   According to a poll released by the Munich-based Sinus Instituteon Tuesday, 84 percent of West Germans think positively aboutGorbachev, 41 percent said they like the Soviets, and 51 percentjudged his reforms positively.   Important groundwork for expanding West German trade with theSoviet Union was laid Monday with the signing of the $1.6 billioncredit agreement, the biggest foreign credit ever extended by WestGerman banks.   Deutsche Bank AG, which heads the consortium of banks, signedthe agreement with Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs. Thecredit line was set up to finance West German exports primarily inthe food, leather, textile and clothing sectors.   West German economic officials hope to expand well beyond thoseareas.   An Economics Ministry report said that the Soviet Union holdsthe potential for a ``wide field of economic cooperation and exportopportunities'' in the areas of agriculture, energy, environmentaltechonology, medical equipment and light and heavy machinery.   The report said the Soviets have drawn up a list of German firmsthey are interested in dealing with.   ``There is enormous potential here,'' said Peter Pietsch, afinance and trade expert at Frankfurt's Commerzbank.   ``The Soviet Union has tremendous market potential for WestGermany and other Western nations,'' Pietsch said. ``By helping theSoviet Union modernize now, we can create the climate andconditions for an even larger trade market in future.''   Economic ties will top the agenda in talks in Moscow next weekbetween Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   In addition to negotiations for more joint ventures, WestGermany hopes to reach agreements in projects ranging fromdeveloping the mineral-rich Kola peninsula in the northwesternSoviet Union to the construction of factories.   Economics Ministry officials also say 12 West German companieswill sign agreements with the Soviet Union. The companiesspecialize in producing packaging machines, furniture processingequipment and truck products.   The news weekly Der Spiegel said an agreement would be signedfor West German companies to set up a trade center in Moscow.   Trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union dropped from$10.30 billion in 1986 to $8.30 billion in 1987, but the EconomicsMinistry said total trade volume is expected to stabilize at thatlevel this year.</TEXT></DOC>
