Kokes confirmed it seeks control of the Howell, N.J., housing and real estate concern.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Kokes family said it has nominated three directors for election at the long-delayed 1988 annual meeting, which it said is scheduled for Sept. 27. That move, the family said, reflects its &quot;strategy to obtain control.&quot; The proposed directors would urge the board to consider measures including selling some or all of the company's assets, the family said.    According to the filing, the family disagrees with President Herbert E. Wishnick over &quot;the operations and strategic direction&quot; of the company, which it said is weighing the dismissal of Mr. Kokes and relatives as officers and employees.    Previously, the family increased its Union Valley direct stake to 32%, exceeding the approximately 31% holding of the Wishnick family. The Kokeses, in a complaint filed in New Jersey state court in Ocean County, also have sued the Wishnicks over the right to vote a 24% block owned by Woodland Properties Inc. Those moves prompted speculation that the families were feuding for control.    Separately, Union Valley said it held a special meeting of its board Thursday to discuss the Kokes family's filing and the possible dismissal of Mr. Kokes and two company executives. </TEXT></DOC>
