(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the temporary Navajo Tribal Counciloffice, one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feetaway, an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync bythe alleged corruption of its chairman.   Peter MacDonald, who had held the highest office of the200,000-member tribe with one interruption since 1971, was votedout by the tribal council in February following allegations that hedemanded kickbacks.   The 60-year-old MacDonald, who says he's innocent, has lived foryears like a potentate in plain view of Indians whose austerecircumstances are proverbial. And yet while he rode in limousinesand flew to Europe, Hawaii and the Super Bowl, he also promisedeconomic development _ a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians.   After spending $650,000 to remodel his offices following hisJanuary 1987 inauguration, MacDonald was secure in his fourth termuntil January when the U.S. Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments.   Witness after witness told of MacDonald demanding kickbacks. Hisson, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., testified after receivingimmunity from prosecution, using a code term in speaking ofunder-the-table payments to his father as ``golf balls.''   When the 88-member Tribal Council began its winter meeting inearly February, it rebelled.   On Feb. 17, a Friday night after many MacDonald supporters hadleft, the dissidents voted 49-13 to place him and Vice ChairmanJohnny Thompson on administrative leave.   The majority picked Leonard Haskie as interim chairman on March10 and has stood united since, giving rise to th name ``49ers.''   ``The joke around here is that it's the 49ers versus theStealers,'' said Cecil Jones of Chinle.   Past Navajo leaders ``usually were very wealthy men, but Iwouldn't say they compare to MacDonald,'' said Duane Beyal,Haskie's press secretary and chief assistant to former chairmanPeterson Zah. ``With them, they were counting herds of sheep; withMacDonald, it's the green stuff.''   In visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters, or wards,MacDonald has maintained his innocence. He has refused repeatedAssociated Press requests for interviews and declined to respond inwriting to a list of questions.   Although the Navajo Supreme Court upheld the council action,MacDonald refused to stop giving orders or vacate what Haskie calls``the Mahogany Palace'' wing of the administration building.   ``I am innocent. And I am entitled under the law to be presumedinnocent. But the Tribal Council could care less,'' MacDonald wrotein an opinion piece for the Gallup (N.M.) Independent.   He has acknowledged taking ``gifts'' from contractors but arguesgift exchanges are a time-honored way of doing business by Indianchiefs. To Haskie, that's a distortion of Indian tradition.   ``Those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendshipwith an individual, not hundreds of thousands of dollars but smallthings _ bracelets, moccasins, a shawl,'' Haskie said.   No one knows how much MacDonald realized from the tribe's 1987purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch, a 491,000-acre spread innorth-central Arizona. Phoenix real estate broker Byron ``Bud''Brown testified that he arranged for a Scottsdale oilman to buy theranch for $26.2 million and sell it a few hours later to theNavajos for $33.4 million.   Brown said he gave MacDonald $50,000 in cash and the use of aBMW sedan, along with paying off a $25,000 loan; dissidents claimMacDonald may have received one-tenth of the profit. A federalgrand jury in Phoenix is investigating the allegations.   In 1975, MacDonald was indicted on fraud and income-tax-evasioncharges. A deadlocked U.S. District Court jury in May 1977 failedto reach a verdict, and the judge ordered a directed verdict ofacquittal.   The longtime tribal leader is not without defenders.   ``Mr. MacDonald is a very strong statesman for Indian peopleacross the country,'' said Donald Benally, chairman of thecouncil's Advisory Committee until Haskie named a new panel.   ``I think we would have really made a big stride in our economicdevelopment if Mr. MacDonald would've gone on without any politicalinterruptions.''   MacDonald, an electrical engineer, worked in the aerospaceindustry in Southern California before he returned to thereservation, where people still live in traditional, five-sided,log-and-mud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atopwind-swept mesas.   The native of Teec Nos Pos, a tiny community less than fivemiles from both Utah and New Mexico in the Four Corners heartlandof Navajo tradition, served three terms as chairman before Zah wonthe 1982 election.   Four years later, MacDonald defeated Zah by about 750 votes outof 61,000 cast.   Haskie said he doesn't know whether he'll run for the$55,000-a-year position in 1990. He added that he expects thechairmanship to have less power when he leaves office.   ``I never sought this job; it just happened so fast,'' said the43-year-old civil engineer.   Haskie has persuaded the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs andCitibank Corp. of Arizona that he is legally in charge.   James H. Stevens, the BIA's Navajo Area director, said courtshad upheld the council majority's action despite MacDonald's claimthat a two-thirds majority was needed to remove him from office.   Noting that Citibank had decided to honor Haskie's signature onchecks, Stevens strengthened Haskie's hand on April 6 by empoweringhim to allocate contracts controlling $91 million in federal fundsfor such purposes as Navajo police work, forest management, fireand judicial services.   Stevens, a San Carlos Apache who grew up in Arizona, views thecouncil's action as a legal housecleaning, but MacDonald hasclaimed that the BIA is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty.   ``This happens in foreign countries, not the Navajo nation,''said council delegate Anderson Tully of Teesto. ``They are copyingcommunistic countries.''   John Chapela, a Window Rock attorney who claims to have gathered37,000 signatures in a drive to recall MacDonald, has visited about25 chapters to show the Senate videotapes.   ``Mr. MacDonald is his own downfall,'' said Chapela, whomMacDonald has fired from three tribal positions. He said MacDonaldis ``our best salesman of the need for a constitution'' that wouldensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders.   MacDonald rejects a constitution as ``an Anglo form ofgovernment.'' And Haskie said tailoring a constitution to tribalneeds would ``require extensive discussion, debates and publichearings.''   Meanwhile, the uncertainty continues.   Paula Martin, director of the Navajo ethics office, said shebelieves many people remain neutral about MacDonald, with fewrecognizing Haskie as a legitimate successor.   ``I think there should be a new election for chairman,'' shesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, May 8</NOTE></DOC>
