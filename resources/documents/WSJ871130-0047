And what happens after Christmas? We'll worry about the future when and if it comes, they say.    Is this herd strategy going to work? Well, perhaps. But herd behavior among retailers often gets managers in trouble, especially in the current environment. Why not break away from the crowd? Go for one of those great, big quota-busting days on the day after Christmas.    Ah, I can already hear the howls:    --&quot;You mean you'd do this when we have such a short staff and everybody's tired?&quot;    --&quot;You mean you'd do this when we get all those complainers anyway (about late delivery, wrong merchandise, insolent salespeople, poor quality and escalator accidents)?&quot;    --&quot;You mean you'd do this when the stocks are broken up and most of the departments aren't put back together?&quot;    --&quot;You mean you'd do this on the very day we try to pack away the Christmas displays, including those in the parking lot?&quot;    Yes, that's what I do mean. This year the Day After is a Saturday, and a great many shoppers will have that weekend off. That's when you should try hard to coax them into your retail establishment. Make the Day After into a slogan: &quot;Come On Back Day.&quot; See that everyone in the entire store knows about the idea and understands it for what it might do in boosting Day After sales.    Come On Back Day is when holiday presents get returned, exchanged, serviced or replaced. Except in a few cases, Come On Back Day is usually the one most retailers would like to see go away. Far away. The excuses are quite legitimate: It's one giant headache; everybody is lying (&quot;I never wore it,&quot; &quot;She never never used it,&quot; &quot;It was broken when they opened the box&quot;); there's never enough time to sell anything; customers are rude as hell and won't listen; sales don't even cover the overhead.    First thing to do is change the Day After's regular publicity in TV spots, newspaper ads, billboards and signs on delivery trucks. The new copy should read something like, &quot;Come On Back -- we'll take back, exchange or give credit for any of your Christmas gifts -- anything you're not satisfied with . . . even if it came to you as a present from another store.&quot;    Do not allow a central customer service office to handle returns that day. Assign plenty of sales staff in every department. Then see that they all have special instructions on how best to deal with customers returning merchandise. Day After returns should be dealt with on the sales floor of specific departments. Why? Because well-trained (and sympathetic) sales people -- familiar with the merchandise -- can offer suggestions to help customers and sometimes save a sale:    --&quot;Let me show you -- this is the way it works (or fits).&quot;    --&quot;What you need is another type, and we have it right here.&quot;    --&quot;I know, you really don't need two toasters. What about this new blender?&quot;    --&quot;Well, it does look like a defect. Let me open another one for you and we'll check it.&quot;    --&quot;It comes in four colors, so maybe peach would look better.&quot;    Make sure that there are big signs at all store entrances and in the parking lot directing returners back to the departments where their merchandise was purchased. In the departments themselves, signs could announce: &quot;Any of our sales staff will be glad to help you with returns or exchanges . . . just ask.&quot; Special bonuses to the sales staff could be authorized to encourage merchandise exchanges, replacements or re-sales.    Let's go back a little. Did I say take back anything? Yes, I did. Anything returned that appears new should be accepted for refund, exchange or credit. Again, I can already hear the skeptics: &quot;How will I sell returned goods I don't carry?&quot; If it isn't your brand, donate it to charity (tax consideration) or sell it discounted to employees. Anything brought back slightly used or defective should be similarly handled.    The Come On Back Day would create extra in-store traffic, set up some talked-about community goodwill, possibly convert some returns to sales and encourage added customer buying. Of course, this assumes first that your after-Christmas stock looks clean and bright, is put together by size and colors, is well-signed and tagged and is attractively priced.    Designed with all the supporting details (including those above and some of your own), Come On Back Day should be a lot better than some of those half-hearted, limp after-Christmas Day sales that come up with the leftover Christmas cards (OK, maybe some distressed stock), half-price tree trimmings and next year's gift wrap. Plus, those horrific post-Christmas hours endured by customers and employees on either side of your merchandise-return counter would become a distant memory.    ---   Mr. Shaffer is a former merchandising executive with many Christmas notches on his markup calculator. </TEXT></DOC>
