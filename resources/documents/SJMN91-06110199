At another, I was a lambada singer.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NASCIMENTO: GREAT MUSIC IN ANY LANGUAGE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pop MusicAdditional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     This would be rather amusing -- he's a lambada singer in the same way thatBarbra Streisand is a heavy metal singer -- except that Nascimento is afraidhe may disappoint some patrons.;    Nascimento, whose tour comes to MountainView on Sunday and to Berkeley on Wednesday, wants his vocal styleunderstood.;    &quot;I don't want them to expect a lambada singer,&quot; he says. &quot;Iwould feel bad for them. I hope I don't ever see that promoter in front ofme.&quot;;    Fortunately, situations like this are becoming rare for Nascimento.Not only for his own work, but for his recent work on Paul Simon's &quot;Rhythm ofthe Saints&quot; album, Nascimento is rapidly being recognized as a first-ratewriter, guitarist and vocalist in any language.;    His own first language isPortuguese, and when he does interviews, he uses an interpreter. Heunderstands English just about perfectly, but it &quot;goes faster,&quot; he explains,if he can respond in his native tongue.;    That's important because he has anumber of things he wants to say, about subjects considerably weightier thanfalse concert promotions.;    Recently he rode up the Amazon River to theBrazilian rain forest and, like most people who do that, came back convincedsomething had to be done to preserve not only the trees but the way of lifefor the people who live there.;    One result was that he formed the Allianceof the Peoples of the Forest, a largely indigent group whose representativeswill travel with him to explain the problems and solutions of the forest.Another result was Nascimento's new album &quot;Txai&quot; (an Indian word meaning&quot;companion&quot; that is pronounced &quot;chi,&quot; to rhyme with &quot;shy&quot;), which blendsNascimento's music with songs and rhythms he gathered from rain-forestpeople.;    This may sound like some sort of arcane folk-music project, butthe result, while hardly standard pop music, is disarmingly melodic, charmingand moving. Furthermore, Nascimento says, he is sharing the royalties with thepeople who created it.;    There has been considerable controversy in recentyears over what some see as the exploitation of regional music byinternational pop stars. Nascimento says that, musically, he sees nothingwrong with such fusion but that there are right and wrong ways to do it.;   Simon, for instance, &quot;does it the way it should be done. He gives somethingback.&quot; Nascimento also does not fault David Byrne. He does say, however, &quot;thatmany artists have taken the music, used it for their own purposes and nevergiven anything to those who created it. This is wrong.&quot;;    For his own music,Nascimento says, he thinks it has a global dimension. &quot;I listen to all typesof music,&quot; he says, adding that the list of musicians he would like to workwith is extensive. If he had to put a name at the top, it might be MilesDavis. &quot;He is my king.&quot;;    On the other hand, his next specific project mightinvolve George Gershwin. &quot;I have always enjoyed his music, but lately I havebeen listening to everything about it and been fascinated. This is often asign that some part of it may appear in my own music.&quot;;    He grins. Actually,his only real problem is time. He recently wrote a ballet for dancer DavidParsons, for instance, and while Parsons has performed it, Nascimento hasn'thad time to see it.;    &quot;I hear it's nice,&quot; he says.;    He probably won'tcatch it for a while, with the rain forest work and the upcoming tour. Andthen there are movies, and chats with friends. And did we mention scubadiving?;    &quot;I like the water,&quot; he says. &quot;I dive in and I forget abouteverything -- even music.&quot;; Milton Nascimento; When: 8 p.m. Sunday; Where:Center for the Performing Arts, Castro and Mercy streets, Mountain View;Tickets: $15-$20; Call: (415) 903-6000; And: 8 p.m. Wednesday, ZellerbachHall, UC-Berkeley.
