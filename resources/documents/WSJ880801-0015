The move follows a preliminary report on the June 26 crash that said there was &quot;no failure of the aircraft or its equipment.&quot; Three people were killed in the crash. The minister said the plane followed all the crew's orders.    The computerized &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; A320 is the latest and most-popular model made by Airbus Industrie, which is owned by Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    Mr. Delebarre said in a statement that he was suspending the two crew members because of &quot;elements about the circumstances of the flight exposed by the commission investigating the accident.&quot; There wasn't any elaboration.    There have been conflicting reports about the altitude of the plane at the time of the accident. The pilot has testified his instruments showed the plane was flying at 99 feet, but sources have quoted investigators as saying the plane was at 33 feet.    A judicial investigation of the accident is still under way. </TEXT></DOC>
