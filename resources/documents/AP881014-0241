The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the Adam Corporation@Groupof Bryant, Texas, a cable television station operator owned by DonA. Adam, is investing $65 million now and an additional $15 millionby the end of 1990 to acquire the 11 institutions.   They are being merged under the name of Olney Savings and LoanAssociation. All deposits, even those over the insurance limit of$100,000, are transferring, the bank board said.   So far this year, regulators have closed or merged 135 insolventSandamp;Ls nationwide, 53 of them in Texas and Oklahoma. Those stateswere hard hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986 and asubsequent break in real estate prices.   Many of the failures in Texas have been blamed on fraud and theabuse of the state's regulatory system.   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., said a study to be published next weekby his House Government Operations subcommittee shows thatthree-quarters of all Sandamp;L insolvencies appear to be linked invarying degrees to misconduct.   At the end of June, there were 7,350 pending federal criminalinvestigations involving 357 failed institutions and thousands ofopen institutions, Barnard said in a statement released by an aide.   The Adam Corporation transaction is the ninth large rescuepackage in Texas since May, bringing total federal assistance toinstitutions in the state to $15.3 billion.   The accelerating pace of Sandamp;L closings and forced mergers by thebank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 thrift institutions,has spurred new debate in Congress on how to restore the industryto health.   The bank board has not acknowledged that it needs more money,but nearly all private analysts say its insurance fund will have tobe bailed out, very possibly with taxpayer funds. So far, all ofthe money used in rescues has come from fees charged the industry.   Legislation creating a blue-ribbon commission to study theproblem and recommend a solution early next year is expected topass Congress before it adjourns next week.   The government aid in the latest package is coming in the formof a $303 million, 10-year promissory note and an additional $1billion in various kinds of guarantees against loss on the failedinstitutions' bad loans.   Regulators said the $1.3 billion was the ``present value'' ofthe assistance, meaning that over time more could be paid out bythe government, but it would be worth about that much if it werepaid out all at once.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will have a 20percent ownership stake in the new Olney. At least 80 percent ofany gains from the bad loans will go to the insurance funds, inaddition to 60 percent of any tax benefits from the deal.   The 11 institutions being acquired by the Adam Corporation are:   Olney Savings Association, Olney; First Federal Savings and LoanAssociation, Amarillo; San Angelo Savings Association, San Angelo;Odessa Savings Association, Odessa; Southwest Savings and LoanAssociation, Abilene; Banc Home Savings Association, Midland;   Southern Savings and Loan Association, Brownwood; Heart O' TexasSavings Association, San Saba; Shamrock Federal Savings Bank,Shamrock; Petroplex Savings Association, Midland; and SecurityFederal Savings and Loan Association, Pampa.</TEXT></DOC>
