SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Earth has apparently been spared the worsteffects of the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the most recent ofthese events coming to a close after a fairly docile stay.   Droughts in India and the Pacific Northwest were reported, aswell as unusually heavy rains in portions of South America, whichscientists have associated with the El Nino which began in 1986.   By contrast, the 1982-83 El Nino disrupted weather around muchof the world, eventually being blamed for 1,500 deaths and damagetotaling between $2 billion and $8 billion.   Vernon E. Kousky of the federal Climate Analysis Center in CampSprings, Md., confirmed Wednesday that Pacific Ocean surfacetemperatures _ a prime gauge of El Nino events _ have returned tonear normal.   An El Nino is considered underway when water temperatures riseone-half degree to one degree Celsius above normal in the westernPacific, Kousky said. Currently, these temperatures have droppedback to normal or even a bit below, he said.   Since climate conditions change only gradually, another El Ninois unlikely for at least two years. Indeed, it may be as long asfour or five years, Kousky said in a telephone interview.   In the meantime he has halted the monthly ``diagnosticadvisories'' issued by his office on the event, known by scientistsas the ENSO, for El Nino-Southern Oscillation.   ``Low-level ... winds, sea surface temperatures, sea levelpressure and central Pacific atmospheric convection indicate areturn to non-ENSO conditions,'' Kousky reported in his finaladvisory.   The name El Nino (pronounced ``el neen'-yo'') was applied bySouth American fishermen, who notice the event because it reducesthe fish catch when water temperatures change. The change usuallyis first noticable around Christmastime, so the fishermen appliedthe Spanish name for child, referring to the Christ Child.   Southern Oscillation is a term used by scientists, referring tochanges in air pressure over the tropical Pacific Ocean.   Only in recent years have researchers determined that the twoevents are interconnected _ thus the combined name now in use.   In a normal El Nino year there is a weakening of the IndianMonsoon, which occurred last summer, along with reductions inrainfall in such areas as Indonesia, the Philippines and severalPacific Islands.   In addition, the El Nino weather patterns last year blocked thenormal movement of storms in the northern Pacific Ocean, pushingthem northward into Alaska and northern British Columbia andapparently leading to a drought in the Pacific Northwest. Warmweather in the western states and wetness in the Southeast arecommon when El Nino occurs.   Thus, the wet winter in the Southeast in 1986-87 may also havebeen related to the event.   These changes are what one would expect in an El Nino, Kouskyhas said. By comparison, ``the 1982-83 one was unusual in that theweather changes were disasterous'' worldwide, Kousky noted.   That event was extraordinarily severe, while the one just endingwas more like other recent El Nino events, such as those of 1957,1963, 1965, 1969, 1972-73, 1975 and 1976.   While scientists are still trying to determine what causes theseperiodic events, they have found that rising ocean temperatures area major factor. The warm water warms the air above it, causing itto rise and increase circulation, and this seems to increase thestrength of westerly winds which push the warm water eastward.   These changes can affect weather around the globe, althoughresearchers are still not sure exactly how all the various weatherevents are connected.   The 1982-83 El Nino was blamed for worsening the drought thatclaimed many lives in Africa.   In addition, that event brought a series of severe winter stormsashore in California, disrupted the fish catch in South America,spawned the first typhoon to hit French Polynesia in 75 years _followed by five more in five months _ deluged Peru and Ecuadorwith record rainfall and promoted the worst drought in 200 years inAustralia.</TEXT></DOC>
