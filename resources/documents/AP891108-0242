Douglas Wilder of Virginia, celebrating an off-year Democraticsurge, claimed a razor-thin breakthrough today as the nation's firstelected black governor. David Dinkins was elected New York City'sfirst black mayor and said voters had responded ``with the voice ofhope, here and in Virginia.''   The volatile politics of abortion hurt Republicans throughout thecampaign and powered an election-day nightmare that extended to NewJersey, where Democratic Rep. James Florio reclaimed thegovernorship for his party and the Democrats also regained controlof the Assembly.   Just as significant as the pro-choice political turnout was theextension of black political success in America's large city halls.Led by Dinkins, blacks also succeeded white mayors in Seattle,Cleveland, New Haven, Conn., and Durham, N.C.   The main event of the day was in Virginia, where Republican J.Marshall Coleman trailed Wilder by 7,700 votes of more than 1.7million cast in the unofficial, final vote count. With all precinctscounted, Wilder had 889,869 votes or 50 percent and Coleman had882,137 votes or 50 percent.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's former chief thrift regulator sayshe was asked by Sen.

The survey, the first of geographic knowledge conducted in theSoviet Union, was commissioned by the National Geographic Society tofind how the United States compared with its neighbors and otherindustrialized nations.   The study found Soviets between ages 18 and 24 scoredsignificantly higher than their American counterparts, but did notdo well when compared with adults of all age groups in the 10nations where the test was given.   ``We believe the results from the survey point to a startlingsuperpower comparison,'' said the Gallup Organization, which calledthe international geography survey the largest of its kind.``Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack ofawareness of the world around them.''</TEXT><DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky.

The slaying of the young activists of the Social ChristianPopular Movement, discovered Tuesday, comes a week after 10 peoplewere killed in the bombing of a leftist labor union's downtownheadquarters.   Leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents,which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10-year-oldcivil war.   There are widespread fears that rightist death squads are againon the prowl after lying low for four years.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration must ``run faster'' andplan better to meet increased competition for civil and militarytechnologies from nations such as Japan and Korea, a top Pentagonadvisory board recommends.   ``National security can no longer be viewed only in militaryterms, but must include economic well-being as a key component. ...This is a distinct departure from the past,'' said the DefenseAdvisory Board, an independent group set up to counsel the Pentagon.   ``The point is, it is not Japan's aggressive roadmap for thefuture that is at fault. Rather, it has been our own inability toget our act together and create a national vision and set of goalsof our own,'' the panel said.   The panel issued a strongly worded report that said the currentpolicies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers ``areno longer appropriate'' and may endanger American's global economicand military well-being.</TEXT></DOC>
