The company said it also expects additional suits to be filed.    In the complaints, the former employees assert that they contracted lung disease from exposure to asbestos and asbestos-contaminated talc in tire factories where they worked.    Talc is used as a lubricant in tire factories to keep rubber from sticking to molds. Cyprus is the nation's largest talc producer; the company also mines precious metals, industrial metals, and coal and industrial minerals.    Tire makers and producers of industrial talc have disputed assertions that the compound causes asbestos damage or that tire workers were exposed to talc containing asbestos.    Cyprus mines talc in five mines in Montana. It said that a federal study found the talc in those mines to be very pure, or containing very little asbestos, which naturally contaminates some talc deposits.    The lawsuits, however, relate to talc from mines Cyprus no longer owns, including one in Silver Lake, Calif., where the asbestos content was as high as 43%, said Gordon Stemple, Los Angeles-based attorney at Stemple andamp; Boyajian for the plaintiffs. He said his clients are all more than 70 years old.    Mr. Stemple has said that he plans to file as many as 30,000 lawsuits against talc and asbestos producers who supplied minerals to tire companies for defendants around the country. The cases are expected to go to trial within six months, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
