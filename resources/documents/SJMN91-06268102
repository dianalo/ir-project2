'It's been an ambiguity. I'm not sure we're going to beable to resolve every ambiguity.';   Allen also laid out the extensiveevidence that led him in 1986 to believe money from Iranian arms sales wasbeing diverted to Nicaraguan rebels -- evidence he presented to Gates.;  Gates has testified that he viewed the Allen's suspicions as &quot;extraordinarilyflimsy&quot; and did not give them a high priority.;   But Allen told the committeetoday that &quot;I had what I call an analytic judgment. Mr. Gates may call itspeculation. That's fair. But I call it an analytic judgment.&quot;;   Allen saidthat he had strong indications, including a weapons price list, that North andhis associates were marking up the arms by 500 percent to 600 percent.;  Allen said he also told Gates, then the agency's deputy director, in an Oct.1, 1986, meeting about North's reference in September to a &quot;reserve&quot; of $4million, and of his concern that North and two others, businessman AlbertHakim and retired Gen. Richard Secord, were running both the Iran initiativeand a resupply effort for the Contra rebels.;   &quot;Mr. Gates appeared startledand disturbed that the White House would involve itself in such a dubiousactivity&quot; and directed Allen to brief then-CIA Director William Casey, Allentestified.;   Allen also seemed to shoulder some of the blame for misleadingtestimony about the Iran-Contra affair delivered by Casey to Congress, sayinghe and other agency officials &quot;served Mr. Casey and Mr. Gates poorly.&quot;;   Andhe said he had &quot;no knowledge and no indication whatsoever that either Mr.Casey or Mr. Gates were at the time deliberately withholding informationrelating to the Iran-Contra affair.&quot;;   Also to testfy today about Gates'knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair was Richard Kerr, the CIA's actingdirector. Kerr has said in sworn testimony that he first told Gates of thepossibility of a diversion in August 1986, but Gates says he can't rememberthat exchange.;   Both Allen and Kerr would be subordinate to Gates if he isconfirmed.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910924  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  553  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 24, 199100268102,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
