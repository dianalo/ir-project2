It is shown that the existence of large danglingbranches attached to a backbone induces a 1/f-like behavior in the currentautocorrelation function at low frequencies. The waiting times associatedwith dangling loops scale like t/sup -3/2/. The size of the danglingbranches provides a lower cutoff to the power law behavior. When theside branches are infinite, self-similar structures, the power law behaviorpersists up to a zero frequency. The currents the authors consider arecreated either by a bias on the random walk or by a current source. Theyconsider both the total current, which is often referred to in the literature,and the current measured at endpoints of a specimen attached to a (model)battery. The differences and similarities between the two correspondingcorrelations are analyzed. In particular, they find that in the secondcase 1/f noise exists only for large bias. When a statistical distributionof dangling branches is considered, they find that the largest powerof frequency in the spectrum is 1.13. Much of their results are truewhen the dangling branches are replaced by traps having waiting timedistributions that equal those of the branches. The waiting time associatedwith a power law distribution of dangling loops (m/sup -x/: m is thelength of the loop) scales like t/sup -1-(x/2)/. However, it is shownthat geometry alone can be responsible for the appearance of power lawsin the spectra. Random geometry can be regarded as a model (or source)of random hopping times.</TEXT></DOC>
