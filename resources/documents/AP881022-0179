The fans of these multibillion-dollar deals say they arepowerful medicine for a stock market still struggling to recoverfrom the crash of 1987.   In the absence of buying by individuals and many institutionalmoney managers, they ask, where would the stock market be todaywithout the leveraged-buyout specialists and the traders, known asarbitragers, who follow in their wake?   What's more, they say, takeovers and buyouts are a long-termplus for the market because they reduce the supply of stock in themarketplace, giving an upward bias to the prices of the shares thatremain available.   But more skeptical observers, while acknowledging some of thosepoints, argue that all this wheeling and dealing is contributinghuge new amounts to an already dangerous accumulation of debt inthe U.S. economy.   And the activity it generates in the market, they say,represents unhealthy speculation rather than stable, long-terminvestment.   The mergers and acquisitions binge is nothing new, of course.Takeovers and buyouts were a dominant force in the 1982-87 bullmarket.   A similar phenomenon occurred in the 1960s, whenconglomerate-building was the financial rage.   Lately, however, the game has been played on an expanded scale.In the past week alone, Philip Morris proposed an $11.4 billionoffer for Kraft and RJR Nabsico said it was considering a $17.6billion management buyout plan.   If such deals can be done, analysts say, there appears to bevirtually no limit to what might be attempted in the future, nocompany too big to be ruled out as a takeover or buyout candidate.   That prospect helped propel stock prices higher in the pastweek. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 50.32 to2,183.50, hitting its highest levels since the crash of '87 as thefirst anniversary of that debacle passed.   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.96 to159.42; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter marketadded 4.00 to 388.59, and the American Stock Exchange market valueindex was up 3.52 at 306.07.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 170.63 million shares a day, upfrom 147.05 million the week before.   ``The short-term rewards to selling shareholders in the form ofcapital gains are indisputable,'' analysts at Wright Investors'Service in Bridgeport, Conn., observed in a recent appraisal of themergers-and-acquisitions craze.   But ``the longer-term effects of takeovers are less healthy forthe economy and for equity investors generally.''   Excessive debt-leveraging of corporate assets makes companiesmore vulnerable in the event of a recession, the report said.   ``In fact, there is the potential that defaults arising fromhigh debt service requirements for companies with reduced cashflows will even aggravate the economy's troubles, when the nextrecession comes.   ``Although industry consolidations and restructurings may oftenbe useful for strengthening the competitive edge in global markets,the transformation of billions of dollars of equity into debt iseroding the financial footings of U.S. industry.   ``Market volatility and instability have increased as a resultof the takeover wave, with the effect of driving many individualinvestors out of the stock market for years to come, if not forgood,'' it said.   Wright noted that the greatest takeover wave in history was abasic cause of the stock market decline last October. The collapsewas as severe as it was ``precisely because the takeover wave hadpushed stock prices to artificially high levels,'' the report said.   ``For that reason alone,'' Wright concluded, ``one should findlittle comfort in the continuing high level of takeover activity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Oct. 22-23</NOTE></DOC>
