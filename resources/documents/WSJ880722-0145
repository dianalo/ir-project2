Meritor set aside an additional $35 million for possible loan losses; $15 million for costs tied to the thrift's continued restructuring and $20 million for the write-down of anticipated losses associated with the sale of some investments in Equity Program Investments Corp., a failed real-estate syndicate known as EPIC.    The thrift is in the midst of a turbulent restructuring that started last September when it reported a third-quarter net loss of $379.6 million that included a one-time charge to wipe away bloated good will. Since then, Meritor has been working to reduce non-performing assets and overall size. Last month, the bank named a new chairman.    The thrift reported income of $3.1 million, or nine cents a share, in the 1987 quarter. For the first six months, Meritor showed a loss of $79.9 million, compared with earnings of $19.5 million, or 56 cents a share, in 1987.    The loan-loss reserve addition is for possible losses in some of Meritor's commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios. James Benson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the bank is &quot;reasonably well reserved&quot; since its loan losses haven't been rising at a time when Meritor has been pumping up its reserves.    Total non-performing assets have dropped to $393 million from $446 million at the end of the first quarter and $472 million in the June 1987 period.    Harold L. Connell, Meritor's chief financial officer, said that after the $20 million set-aside for possible losses tied to the sale of EPIC properties, the thrift has $104 million left of EPIC-related real-estate investments. He explained these remaining properties are being carried on Meritor's books at market value, based on recent appraisals. If current real-estate market conditions remain steady, he expects the bank could sell these properties without further losses that would be taken against future earnings.    Meritor also joined the Federal Home Loan Bank system last month. It can borrow intermediate-term funds from the bank system which would allow Meritor to more closely match its assets and liabilities. Its deposits are still insured by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    Last month, Meritor named Roger S. Hillis, a respected Philadelphia banker and chairman of PNC Financial Corp., as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Hillis replaced Frederick S. Hammer, who was demoted to president.    Meritor shares closed unchanged at $4.875 in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
