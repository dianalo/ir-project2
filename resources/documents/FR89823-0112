This document sets forth Customs views regardingthese documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Paul Giguere, Director, InternationalNomenclature Staff, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW.,Washington, DC 20229 (202-566-8530).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Pursuant to section 1204 of Public Law 100-418, the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS)was implemented effective as to merchandise entered or withdrawn for consumptionon or after January 1, 1989.Since the implementation of the HTS, Customs has been urged to take intoconsideration a host of documents as background documentation in the classificationof goods. These have included, not only the Explanatory Notes to the HarmonizedSystem (HS), but such documents as reports of the Nomenclature Committee(the committee that administered the Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature),letters from the Secretariat of the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) andrulings and regulations from other Customs administration. All of thesematters are urged on Customs as an indication of the intent of the HarmonizedSystem Committee (HSC) in drafting the system, or, sometimes, on the groundsthat Customs has an obligation to interpret the HTS in uniformity withthe interpretation of the CCC or that of other Contracting Parties to theConvention on the Commodity Description and Coding System (the Convention).This notice explains Customs position on the various documentation thatis available and gives an overall assessment of the weight that shouldbe accorded to the various documents.Uniformity in the interpretation of the international system, the HS, isnot a function of Customs. Customs is charged with the administration andinterpretation of the HTS, the tariff enacted by Congress. The functionof maintaining the uniform application of the HS resides with the HSC perArticle 7 of the Convention. It is fundamental that the United States didnot give up sovereignty when it acceded to the Convention. There is, assuch, no obligation on Contracting Parties for uniform application of theHS. There is, however, an obligation on Contracting Parties to ``not modifythe scope of the sections, chapters, headings or subheadings of the HarmonizedSystem.'' Consequently, Customs takes background documentation into considerationso that classification rulings do not so modify the system. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Committees</ITAG>An understanding of the documentation issued by the CCC requires some backgroundinto the various committees that dealt with the HS. The HS was draftedby a committee known as the HSC. Unfortunately this is the same name asthe committee formed under the Convention, and this has produced some confusion.Four committees have dealt with the HS: (1) The HSC which existed from1973 to 1983; (2) the Interim HSC; (3) the HSC formed under the Convention;and (4) the Nomenclature Committee.<T3>The drafting Harmonized System Committee: </T3>The HSC which was chargedwith drafting the HS met in 31 sessions from June 1973 to June 1983. Itsreports are designated: Summary Record of the xx Session of the HarmonizedSystem Committee and its Working Party.<T3>The Interim Harmonized System Committee (IHSC): </T3>This committeemet in 9 sessions, jointly with the Nomenclature Committee, from 1983 tillthe Convention went into force on January 1, 1988. It drafted the HS ExplanatoryNotes and reviewed the Compendium of Classification Opinions. Althoughit had no particular legal standing it did make proposals for amendingthe HS.<T3>The Harmonized System Committee:</T3> The committee formed under theConvention. It is the committee currently charged with the administrationof the Convention. It meets twice a year and held its first session inApril 1988.<T3>The Nomenclature Committee:</T3> The committee formed to administerthe Customs Cooperation Council Nomenclature (CCCN) (first known as theBrussels Tariff Nomenclature), the nomenclature which is replaced by theHS. Because the Nomenclature Committee had agreed to amend the CCN to conformto the HS, it reviewed the work of the HSC to see if it found it acceptablefor purposes of the CCCN.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Documents</ITAG>Explanatory NotesThe status of the Explanatory Notes (ENs) to the HS is specifically addressedin the report of the Joint Committee on the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988. It is there stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Explanatory Notes constitute the Customs Cooperation Council'sofficial interpretation of the Harmonized System. They provide a commentaryon the scope of each heading of the Harmonized System and are thus usefulin ascertaining the classification of merchandise under the system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Explanatory Notes were drafted subsequent to the preparation ofthe Harmonized System nomenclature itself, and will be modified from timeto time by the CCC's Harmonized System Committee. Although generally indicativeof proper interpretation of the various provisions of the Convention, theExplanatory Notes, like other similar publications of the Council, arenot legally binding on contracting parties to the Convention. Thus, whilethey should be consulted for guidance, the Explanatory Notes should notbe treated as dispositive.</ITAG>This is a clear statement of the intent of Congress in adopting the HSas a basis for the U.S. Tariff. The status outlined by the Joint Committeeof Congress applies only to the ENs and ``similar publications of the Council.''In that connection Customs would point out that the only similar publicationof the Council is the Compendium of Classification Opinions.Among the international conventions administered by the CCC, the HS isa replacement for the former CCCN. There were ENs to the CCCN and theyare sometimes cited in requests for rulings. The CCCN ENs have no valuein interpreting the HS. They are the ENs to a different system; one whichis now virtually nonexistent since most nations have adopted the HS.It should also be noted that the ENs are a dynamic instrument reflectingthe intent of the Contracting Parties on the application and interpretationof the HS. They will be amended from time to time and may thus reflecta change in interpretation. Customs believes they should always be consulted.Classification OpinionsThe CCC publishes a Compendium of Classification Opinions. These opinionsrepresent decisions by the HSC on the classification of various productsthat were presented to the HSC for consideration. When a classificationquestion is presented to the HSC, the Committee will frequently draft anopinion to be published in the Compendium. However, that is not alwaysthe case. Sometimes the decision of the HSC is converted into an amendmentto the ENs, and sometimes it is merely reported in the report of the sessionof the HSC when the decision was made. The decision is included in theCompendium when it is thought to be particularly instructive.When a decision of the HSC is published in the Compendium it should receivethe same weight as ENs. They constitute the official interpretation ofthe HS in consideration of a particular issue placed before the HSC.There was also a Compendium of Classification Opinions under the CCCN.The Interim HSC reviewed that Compendium and adopted into the HS Compendiuma number of the CCCN opinions. Approximately 20 percent of the CCCN opinionswere carried over to the HS. The remainder were discarded, some becausethey were outdated, some because their substance had been incorporatedinto the HS ENs and some because they were thought to be erroneous underthe HS. Opinions reported in the CCCN Compendium have no validity underthe HS for the same reasons the CCCN ENs are not valid under the HS.HSC Reports Prior to July 1983The HSC prior to 1983 was tasked with drafting the HS. This required numerousdecisions and these are reported in the Summary Records of the HSC sessions.The Summary Records of HSC sessions are a resource in ascertaining theintent of the Committee in the drafting of any particular text. Becausethe sessions were long and rather involved, the deliberations of the Committeeare reported only in summary form. The Summary Records do contain reportson a number of decisions of the HSC. When such decisions are clearly reportedthey constitute history for the text concerned. The Summary Records areavailable to the public through the Department of Commerce National TechnicalInformation Service. While these documents do not carry the weight of theENs or the Compendium of Classification Opinions, they are frequently guidesto the intention of the HSC.Interim HSC ReportsThe IHSC drafted the ENs and reviewed the CCCN Compendium of ClassificationOpinions. The reports of this Committee have the same relationship to thosedocuments as do the Summary Records of the HSC to the legal texts of theHS. Since the ENs have no legal standing, these reports are not consideredhistory for the HS. Customs considers them to be instructive in some instances.The IHSC also considered a number of amendments to the HS. Because theIHSC had no defined standing, all of the IHSC decisions on amendments werereferred to the HSC when the Convention came into force. Therefore, forsome of the proposed amendments to the HS, background information can befound in the reports of the IHSC.Report of the HSC After 1/1/88The Convention went into force on January 1, 1988, and sessions thereafterare reported in Reports of the Harmonized System Committee. The first sessionwas held in April 1988. Decisions of this committee are advice and guidesto the interpretation of the HS. None of these decisions are binding, butCustoms considers that they often provide valuable insight into how theHSC views certain provisions.In rendering its decisions, the HSC also usually decides whether the decisionmerits an amendment to the ENs, the issuance of a classification opinionto be added to the Compendium, or to merely report the decision in thereport of the session. If the decision results in amendment of the EN orgoes into the Compendium, it, then, should receive considerable weight.As Congress made clear, however, the decision should not be treated asdispositive.Decisions of the HSC that are merely given in the report should be givenlittle weight.Decisions to amend the HS itself need to go through the amendment procedureprovided in the Convention. They require domestic legislation to go intoeffect in the United States.Nomenclature Committee ReportsCustoms is frequently asked to consider reports of the Nomenclature Committee.They carry virtually no weight. Decisions of the Nomenclature Committeecannot imply an intent on the HSC. They are two separate committees, differentlyconstituted, and set up for different purposes.Normally, the HSC received reports from the Nomenclature Committee withoutcomment. When the HSC adopted an opinion or decision of the NomenclatureCommittee it was specifically noted in the Summary Record.When the HS was drafted it was decided to prepare an entirely new conventionto implement it. It was the intention of the HSC to start anew; to havea new convention unencumbered by the many years of action by the NomenclatureCommittee. Although the HS is primarily based on the CCCN, it is a newand different nomenclature with a convention that provides for substantialdifference in its voting membership. Customs finds that there is no reasonto believe that questions decided by the Nomenclature Committee would producethe same result in the HSC.Working DocumentsCustoms calls ``working documents'' those documents issued by the Nomenclatureand Classification Directorate of the CCC. These are the documents thatform the basis for discussions in HSC sessions. They carry virtually noweight in interpreting the system. Working documents usually consist ofcommentary by delegations on questions before the Committee, commentaryby the Secretariat on various drafts and proposals, commentary by the Secretariaton the comments made by delegations, and other material designed to framethe question the HSC is to discuss and to stimulate the discussion. Becauseit is preliminary material, none of it reflects the intent of the HSC.The working documents are sometimes interesting because they contain moredetailed descriptions of the goods under consideration and they sometimescontain the rationale for certain positions.Rulings of Other CountriesThe General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, theSection and Chapter Notes and the first six digits of the Harmonized Systemconstitute the international nomenclature. Therefore, in principle, allContracting Parties to the Convention should give the same classificationto identical merchandise through the six-digit subheading level. In thisregard, classification rulings from other Customs administrations are sometimessubmitted to Customs with a ruling request as evidence of how similar merchandisehas been classified under the HS by that country.Customs is not bound to abide by another country's rulings. The foreignruling may have been subject to political realities or domestic regulationswhich are different from our own. The merchandise at issue in our rulingmay not be identical to that in the foreign ruling. In either case, theforeign ruling is unlikely to describe fully the context in which it wasissued. Therefore, at best, the foreign ruling is merely instructive ofhow others may classify like goods.Position PapersPrior to each session of the HSC, Customs, the International Trade Commissionand the Bureau of the Census prepare position papers to reflect the positionto be taken by the U.S. delegation at the session. These documents in noway reflect the position of Customs in the interpretation of the HTS. Positionpapers are guides for the delegation in the context of the HSC session;they are essentially negotiating positions. They are mentioned here becausesome position papers have received some circulation and have been citedin support of a classification; they have no value whatever for such purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>Customs is charged with the interpretation of the HTS and not, as such,of the HS.Customs concern in looking at documents is to find the scope of headingsand subheadings of the HTS.As indicated by Congress, Customs will give considerable weight to ExplanatoryNotes and the Compendium of Classification Opinions because they are theofficial interpretation of the HS, but they shall not be treated as dispositive.When it is necessary to determine the intent of the HSC, Customs will lookto the Reports and Summary Records of the HSC.Other documentation may be consulted for information purposes only.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: August 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">D.
