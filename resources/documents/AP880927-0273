The $4.6 billion restructuring will leave Kroger shareholderswith continuing interest in the company and will be more lucrativethan the unsolicited purchase offers by Dart Group Corp. theinvestment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Kroger officialssaid Monday in outlining the plan.   Kroger Chairman Lyle Everingham and president Joseph Pichlersaid the restructuring also would turn Kroger, the nation's largestsupermarket operator, into a smaller, albeit highly leveragedcompany.   Kroger's board of directors rejected as inadequate both the $4.6billion cash and securities offer by New York-based Kohlberg Kravisand the rival $4.32 billion bid by Dart, of Landover, Md.   The board also was advised there could be antitrust problemswith the offer from Kohlberg Kravis, which recently outbid Dart forthe Safeway and Stop andamp; Shop grocery chains.   Kroger stock rose 62{ cents to close at $56.37{ a share in NewYork Stock Exchange trading Monday.   The restructuring, which will be Kroger's second since 1986, isworth $57 to $61 per share, officials said.   Kroger's plan, which was publicly proposed Sept. 13, would paycompany shareholders $40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at$8 and publicly traded stock worth between $5 and $10.   The company will net about $333 million from the sale of assets,and will lay off workers at its Cincinnati headquarters.   Everingham declined to tell reporters which food processingplants will be sold or how many headquarters employees would belaid off. Those layoffs will be in addition to a cost-cuttingprogram already under way to reduce headquarters employment throughattrition, Everingham said.   Kroger said it had commitments for $3.6 billion in bankfinancing for the restructuring, from a group led by New York'sCitibank and Chemical Bank and First National Bank of Chicago.   Spokesmen for Dart and Kohlberg Kravis declined comment Monday.   Kroger said it would sell some of its food processing facilitiesnationwide; its 27-supermarket Fry's of California division innorthern California; its six-unit Welcome Inc. superwarehouseventure in Greenville, S.C., Jacksonville, Fla., Mobile, Ala., andRichmond, Va.; and its 29 supermarkets in Charlotte, N.C., andCharleston, S.C.   Kroger also said it would sell its 16-unit Price SaversWholesale Warehouse Inc. to a management-led investment group,would continue the sale of its Florida Choice division, and wouldand then lease back Kroger-owned stores and real estate in Texas.It will continue its Texas retail operations in that state and willsell its general merchandise distribution center in San Marcos,Texas.   The 105-year-old company announced Friday that it intended to goahead with the restructuring despite competing offers by Dart andKohlberg Kravis. The Haft family, which controls Dart, triggeredthe competition when federal regulators announced this month thatthey had given the Hafts clearance to buy at least $15 millionworth of Kroger stock.   Dart, a retailing company which has been involved in a number ofunsuccessful but profitable takeover bids in recent years, offereda week ago to buy Kroger for $55 a share in cash and securities foreach of Kroger's 78.6 million outstanding shares.   Kohlberg Kravis entered the bidding Tuesday with an offer to buyKroger for $58.50 in cash and securities in a leveraged buyout.   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 conveniencestores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company alsoprocesses food products for sale in its stores and to outsidecustomers.   Kohlberg Kravis won a hostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos.in which the Haft family was a bidder in 1985, and outbid the Haftsfor Safeway in 1986 and Stop andamp; Shop earlier this year.   Dart owns the Crown Books and Trak Auto Stores chains.</TEXT></DOC>
