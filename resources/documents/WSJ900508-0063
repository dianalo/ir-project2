Analysts viewed the announcement as acknowledgment byLotus that the Windows program of archrival Microsoft isbecoming popular with customers. &quot;It's a concession by Lotusthat the groundswell for Windows is pretty strong,&quot; saidDavid Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.</LP><TEXT>   Lotus had previously downplayed the role of Windows, aprogram that allows many different programs to work togetherin a single computer and share some features such aspull-down menus of instructions. But Microsoft is expected tounveil its next version, Windows 3.0, on May 22 in New Yorkand many customers who have seen the product are raving aboutits power. Windows has a graphical user interface, like AppleComputer Inc.'s Macintosh, that includes icons andoverlapping windows to make the computer easier to use.   Lotus also introduced a new version of its existing 1-2-3Release 3.0 product called Release 3.1 that provides improvedcapabilities for printing out spreadsheets and also offersmany graphics features. The new version, which will beavailable in the third quarter, will work with Windows, butwon't take advantage of all of Windows' capabilities.   Frank Ingari, a Lotus vice president, said that thedecision to add the Windows version sometime in the futurereflected requests from Lotus customers. However, hepredicted that Release 3.1 will become the standard productfor users who want advanced spreadsheet capabilities.   Analysts were impressed with the printing and graphicstechnology of Lotus's new Release 3.1. Lotus acquired it fromAleph 2, a Paris software developer. Terms weren't disclosed.&quot;My guess is that Lotus users will adore this product,&quot; saidJeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass.,newsletter.   However, &quot;I see the market being a little confused,&quot; byall the different 1-2-3 products, said Richard Sherlund, ananalyst with Goldman Sachs. And Robert Therrien ofPaineWebber Inc. said that &quot;there's so much hype surroundingthe productivity gains from using Windows that this will begreeted by a lot of people as ho hum.&quot;   Analysts said that Release 3.1 should sell better than itspredecessor, the long-awaited Release 3.0 that went on salelast June. Partly due to its limited printing capabilities,Release 3.0 has accounted for only about 25% of Lotus 1-2-3sales since then. Release 2.2, a more limited version thathas better printing ability, costs $100 less and is usable onsmaller personal computers, has been Lotus's big seller sincelast summer.   Release 3.1, like Release 3.0, will sell for $595.Existing Release 3.0 users can upgrade for $35.</TEXT></DOC>
