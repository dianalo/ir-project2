Nearly all of her front yard is paved tofit the vehicles.;    The ordinance would affect only new additions, notdriveways that are already more than 50 percent of the frontage.;    &quot;If theycan't park in the front, what are they supposed to do?&quot; she asked. &quot;If wecould afford to put our boat in storage, we wouldn't. There is too muchvaluable stuff on it. We like to keep it where we can keep an eye on it.&quot;;   RV owners say they have nowhere else to park their long, high vehicles.Parking on the street is limited to 72 hours. And they don't like to put thevehicles in storage because it is costly and because the mobile homes becomeless mobile.;    However, the city's planning director, Geoff Goodfellow, saidowners don't have a &quot;God-given right to put what they want on their lots.&quot;;   &quot;What if they wanted to park an airplane on their front yard?&quot; he asked.;   Goodfellow said the ordinance wasn't that restrictive because people can stillfit the vehicles on most lots. Most driveways now take up 25 to 30 percent ofa yard and they can still add driveway space for the vehicles.;    Maximumpenalties would be $250 for the first violation; $350 for the second and $500for additional violations.;    The bicycling issue has been an ongoing sourceof contention as well.;    Santa Clara, with an industrial base that drawscommuters from all over the Peninsula, is the only city that still bansbicycles from the wide lanes along expressway shoulders.;    Police and PTArepresentatives have supported the ban, saying they fear school children wouldstart using the expressways if the ban is dropped. However, bike enthusiastssay that because of noise and traffic, only serious commuters would use them.They also note that the ban stifles commuting alternatives to cars, becausethe expressways are the only convenient route to employment centers from trainstations.;    The city's staff has recommended continuing the ban, but bikeenthusiasts hope the council's newest member, Tim Jeffries, a 27-year-oldSanta Clara University alum, will help change the past 4-3 vote against theban.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara City Council meets at 7 p.m. atCity Hall, 1500 Warburton Ave.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRAD KAVA, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910514  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  557  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 14, 199100135152,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
