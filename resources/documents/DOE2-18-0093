The gas proposedfor export would be exported through British Columbia to the USA. Inthe hearing, complaints, export impact assessments, and other factorsrelating to the public interest were considered, including gas reserves,productive capacity, markets, pipeline facilities, and net benefits toCanada. It was concluded that the proposed export volume is small comparedto expected requirements and that it is unlikely the proposed exportwill cause Canadians difficulty in meeting their energy needs at fairmarket prices. It was revealed that Pan-Alberta's contracts with itssuppliers were being renegotiated to extend the contract terms to correspondwith the proposed license term. The requisite provincial removal permits,pipeline facilities, and markets in the USA were all seen to be present.A social cost benefit analysis was submitted to demonstrate the economicbenefits to Canada from the proposed exports. As a result of this application,it was decided to issue a new license which would embody the terms andconditions requested by the applicant.</TEXT></DOC>
