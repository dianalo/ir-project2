Boyd, deputy assistant director for operations inthe FBI's Technical Services Division.andP;  OMB told the agency there will be nomoney in the president's budget for NCIC upgrades in 1991, he said.andM;Though OMB gave no official reason for the cut, Boyd said he sensed theagency had a problem with such a big-ticket item when funds are extremelyscarce.andM;FBI officials had earmarked most of the proposed $17 million for softwaredevelopment, but $5 million was intended for preparing to move NCIC functionsfrom the FBI's Washington headquarters to a new Virginia site.andP;  Another $2million would have been spent on telecommunications and hardware to bring upsome NCIC 2000 functions before the entire upgraded system came on line.andO;Specifically, the FBI hoped to provide photograph and fingerprinttransmission to law enforcement vehicles, Boyd said.andM;If Congress fails to restore the funding, Boyd said the agency will keepsubmitting the request until it does obtain the funds.andM;&quot;Overall, the bureau, like a lot of federal agencies, is strapped forfunding,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Congress is great at approving funds, but notappropriating them.&quot;andM;If the delays persist for more than a few budget cycles, the bureau will beforced to re-establish the need for the upgraded NCIC, Boyd said.andP;  Though itis unlikely the need will go away, costs and technology options will changedramatically over time, he said.andM;OMB officials would not comment on any items in the 1991 budget because thepresident has not released it, said OMB spokesman Tom Bruce.andP;  President Bushis expected to send his 1991 budget proposal to Congress later this month.andM;Edwards, who had been traveling in Czechoslovakia until early this month, hadnot had time to speak with OMB officials about the cut, but promised he wouldshortly.andM;He has long been involved in NCIC oversight.andP;  In the past year, hissubcommittee has pushed hard for improved data integrity and privacyenhancements.andM;Without the improvements, he said, &quot;not only will privacy be endangered butthe national crime effort will be endangered.&quot;andM;The NCIC now handles sometimes as many as a million requests daily, Boydsaid.andP;  Without upgrades, the system probably will reach capacity, he said.andM;At that point, the bureau may need to control use and allow only specifictypes of requests, Boyd said.andP;  The last time the agency faced a similarcrunch was in the 1970s, he said.andM;The bureau should be able to maintain the current NCIC performance with theroughly $6 million to $7 million operating budget for the center.andP;  Boyd said.andO;That money covers data processing expenses, personnel costs for the center's100 employees and telecommunications charges, he said.andM;The center might try to use some fiscal 1990 funds for equipment upgrades toavoid hitting capacity, he said.andP;  But that is highly speculative, he added.andM;The FBI cannot absorb the $17 million cut and shift funding from some otheragency projects.andM;&quot;The organization traditionally has run lean and mean,&quot; Boyd said.andP;  &quot;Sothere's usually little excess funding lying around.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
