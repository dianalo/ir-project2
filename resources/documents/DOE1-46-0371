The level andsize distribution of suspended particles in ambient air was measuredfrom 24-h samples taken at 6-day intervals from a network of 29 hivolTSP samplers, and nine Andersen 2000 4-stage cascade impactors. Exposurewas computed by generating a 3-dimensional response surface using a linearregression model of the form: TSP = (1 + E + N){sup 2}, based on monthlygeometrical mean data for all sites. From this response surface generatedfor a given month, TSP levels were predicted by the model for all schoolsby specifying their geographical coordinates. The yearly exposure fora given child was determined from the arithmetic mean of the predictedvalues for 12 monthly TSP levels. A similar procedure was employed forcalculation of the exposure to the fine ({le} 3.3 {mu}m) and coarse (andgt;3.3 {mu}m) size fraction, as well as the aerodynamic mass median diameterof particles from the network of cascade impactors. Results of the measurementsshowed that gradients for TSP up to approximately 10 {mu}g/m{sup 3}/kmexist over the city covering distances from 5 to 10 km. The range of1 yr mean exposure values calculated for each child was from 30.5 {mu}g/m{sup3} to 74.5 {mu}/m{sup 3}. Comparable figures for particle size were upto 0.3 {mu}m AMMD (aerodynamic mass median diameter)/km and annual meanparticle size exposure from 2.69 to 3.53 {mu}m AMMD.</TEXT></DOC>
