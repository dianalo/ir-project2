(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Each night, a flat and barren stretchof border comes alive with the muffled sound of tires rolling northover the baked earth. The vans and cars go lightless in the dark,their cargoes silent and hopeful.   The stretch of Otay Mesa is one of the areas most vulnerable toillegal immigration along the United States' 1,950-mile border withMexico.   That's why the Immigration and Naturalization Service'senforcement arm wants a four-mile ditch dug to provide a trafficobstruction that nature lacks.   Border Patrol officials defend the plan as justified becausethey're swamped by alien smugglers driving through the border. If itworks for them, the officials say, it can work for those bringingdrugs into country.   But the symbolism of the barrier _ likened by a JusticeDepartment official to a ``buried Berlin Wall'' _ has generated afirestorm of controversy.   The South Bay Chapter of the Mexican American PoliticalAssociation denounced the ditch as a ``feudalistic'' approach tointernational relations. The Mexican government suggests it wasdeceived about what it had been told was a concrete-reinforceddrainage ditch. And San Diego officials, stung by the failure toseek their comment on the project, are indignant.   ``We're dealing with a very organized group of people. They'renot just mom and pop out here smuggling for the weekend,'' said KenStitt of the Brown Field Border Patrol station. ``They know when ourshifts are and they'll hit us at shift changes, things like that.''   The smugglers make $250 to $2,000 a head, depending on whetherthe alien's trip began in Mexico or Central and South America, Stittsaid. With the stakes so high, alien-smugglers increasingly takedesperate measures to slip past the Border Patrol onto a network ofroads less than a quarter mile from the border.   ``There's very little regard on the part of these drivers for thepeople in their vehicles,'' he said. ``They've thrown rocks at ouragents, people have fallen out and been run over because the doorpopped open. They've held up babies letting us know women andchildren are in the vehicle.''   Only a small fraction of the 1,550 known vehicle drive-throughsin the Otay Mesa area since July 1 resulted in apprehensions.   The $2 million ditch would be wide enough (14 feet) and deepenough (five feet) to obstruct illegal traffic while providing aneeded drainage channel.   U.S. immigration officials see the ditch as an innocuous way tohelp regain control of the San Diego border area, where aboutone-third of the 1.2 million alien apprehensions last year were made.   Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Michael Gregg said the vastmajority of the 1988 arrests _ only two of five illegal crosserswere caught _ in the sector occurred along 10 miles from the beacheast to the base of Otay Mountain.   ``I think the people living south of the border are going to keepcoming,'' said Alberto Ala, an undocumented worker living in a SanDiego County migrant camp. ``Mexico is a hungry country and we needto eat. I don't think a hole in the ground can stop us. We canalways go around it.   ``They can't build a hole from the beach of Tijuana all the wayto Brownsville, Texas, so we will find a way to cross regardless,through the air, ocean or any other way. It doesn't matter what Ifeel. Whatever the U.S. government wants to do, it does, whether itworks or not.''   The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washingtonlobbying group, criticized the ditch as a halfway measure and calledfor 55 miles of elaborate security fences along the U.S.-Mexicoboundary to halt what spokesman Patrick Burns called an ``onslaughtof humanity.''   The sunken fences proposed by FAIR, which is seekingcongressional sponsorship, would cost about $3 million per mile.They would be fronted by a slope leading to a 12-foot concreteretainer topped by an 8-foot curving, metal fence. The groupproposed financing the barriers and other border security devices bycharging people a $2 fee to cross the border.   Border Patrol officials view some of the FAIR proposals asunrealistic in expense and impact on international relations.   ``For the most part, I don't think our agents want a fortressalong the border,'' Stitt said. ``We realize that most of the peoplecoming across the border are doing so for one thing _ to eat. Sothere's empathy there. But at the same time, we just have to havesome control.''   ``All these proposals do is raise anti-Mexican hysteria,'' saidAl Ducheny of the Mexican American Association. ``No amount offences and border guards and ditches is going to resolve the illegalimmigration problem.   ``Any reasonable person looking at these plans has to ask, `Wheredoes the need for security stop and our need to improve relationswith our neighbor begin?'''   The irony of the uproar over the ditch proposal, which next willbe the subject of an environmental impact report, is that itoriginated in response to Mexico's concerns over increased runofffrom Otay Mesa.   Development has changed the land, and as warehouses, factoriesand roads are built on the mesa, the paved ground on the San Diegoside can't absorb runoff. Mexico's adjacent flatlands could become aquagmire from excess rainwater now following the land's gentle slopetoward Tijuana.   ``The concern of the drainage was a concern Mexico broached tous,'' in 1986, said Bob Ybarra of the U.S. Section of theInternational Boundary and Water Commission in El Paso, Texas. Thecommission was set up 100 years ago to carry out boundary and watertreaties requiring joint engineering work.   ``The U.S. Section studied alternatives and we find that theditch is the only practical way to settle an international issue,''Ybarra said.   Before completion of a final review of the ditch, the U.S.Section was told of a Border Patrol plan to build concrete barriersin the same area to try to curb the illegal drive-throughs. Ybarrasaid concrete barriers would have excacerbated drainage problems.   He declined comment on why Mexico wasn't told of the ditch's dualpurpose.   Mexican officials now appear noncommittal toward the project,which some Mexican politicians see as ``unfriendly.' And the BorderPatrol admits that the premature release of the deterrent aspectsbecame a public relations disaster.   ``We really had hoped it could be explained, and once peopleunderstand what it is or at least educated to what the problem isthat it wouldn't have that connotation,'' Stitt said. ``In no waywill it resemble a Berlin Wall either in looks or in what it's goingto accomplish.   ``This is not just a problem the Border Patrol has. It's aproblem the nation has.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Feb. 13</NOTE></DOC>
