Gung-ho Wall Street traders, who a few years ago created amarket in Brazilian, Mexican and other Third World bank debt,now are turning their attention to bank loans to leveragedU.S. companies.</LP><TEXT>   Most of these loans were made to finance leveragedbuy-outs, in which acquisition debt is paid with fundsgenerated by the acquired company, and other takeovers. Theborrowers range from Ames Department Stores Inc. to ZapataCorp. Recent market quotes for such bank loans vary from 20cents to 70 cents for each dollar of face value.   The traders' opportunity may become commercial banks'embarrassment. This is because commercial banks generallyvalue their corporate loans at 100 cents on the dollar,unless the borrower stops paying interest. Banks seldom markdown their loan portfolios to market value to reflect anypreliminary deterioration in credit quality, thoughregulators recently have been pressing banks to make someadjustments.   As loan traders start to price some leveraged-company debtat big discounts to face value, &quot;That's going to raisequestions about banks' carrying values of loans,&quot; JamesMcDermott, head of bank-stock research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp;Woods, said. &quot;To the extent that {corporate bank-debttrading} becomes a viable market, it will contribute topsychological pressure to mark these loans to market.&quot;   Overall trading in distressed corporate bank loans totalsa modest $100 million a month, dealers estimated. But&quot;Business is really picking up,&quot; said Tom Hendrick, a loantrader at Continental Illinois Corp.   On Wall Street, the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of SalomonInc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. recently set up departments totrade leveraged-company bank loans. They are following in thesteps of the market pioneers Oppenheimer andamp; Co., R.D. Smith andamp;Co. and the Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. unit of Bear Stearns Cos.Even some banks, such as Citicorp and Bankers Trust New YorkCorp., are building up specialties in trading these loans.   The potential pool of tradable bank loans is huge. As ofJune 30, the 25 largest U.S. banks held $69 billion of whatregulators call &quot;highly leveraged transaction&quot; loans,according to a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst, Arthur Soder.Most of these loans were booked in the late 1980s leveragebinge, often with the lure of big upfront fees for the banksthat made them. The loans generally pay interest of 1 1/2percentage points above the prime lending rate.   While many of banks' leveraged loans have been made torelatively healthy companies, such as Time Warner Inc. andRJR Nabisco Inc., analysts estimate that 5% to 10% are tocompanies that have tumbled into financial distress. Some ofthe ailing companies have defaulted on their bank debt;others continue to make interest payments but may facefinancial restructurings to sort out their overall debtobligations.   As a result, traders say, a two-tier trading market hasdeveloped. Healthy bank loans routinely are swapped amongbanks at 100 cents on the dollar, or close to it.Troubled-company bank loans, however, are increasingly quotedby Wall Street traders at big discounts to face value. Buyersof these loans tend to be so-called vulture funds that seekprofits by investing in troubled companies at cut-rateprices.   Selling off corporate loans at a discount to face value is&quot;a fairly new and revolutionary concept for banks,&quot; saidSteven Miller, an analyst at Loan Pricing Corp. who edits&quot;The Loan Investor&quot; newsletter. Both U.S. and overseasregulators, however, are leaning hard on banks to rein intheir leveraged lending. This has prompted some regional andforeign banks to take losses on bad loans and get out, Mr.Miller said.   Trading distressed bank debt isn't easy. Most loans areencumbered with phonebook-sized supporting documents, saidChristopher Mackey, an analyst at Halcyon DistressedSecurities Fund. Switching ownership of a loan can takeweeks. Typical transaction sizes are $5 million or $10million, putting the market out of reach for most individualinvestors.   As is true of any small market, potential sellers andbuyers often are so far apart in their proposed prices thattrades can't occur. When trades do close, Wall Street firmsor other middlemen typically collect fees of 1% of the loan'sface value. This is a much richer haul than ordinary stockand bond trading provides for middlemen.   At cheap enough prices, some vulture funds see opportunityin buying even the diciest bank loans. Halcyon bought someZapata bank debt at 35 cents on the dollar earlier this year,Mr. Mackey said, even though the energy company incurred biglosses in the late 1980s and missed interest payments on itsbonds last year. Zapata's bank debt recently climbed to 60cents on the dollar, as surging oil prices have brightenedthe company's outlook.   &quot;A lot of people who historically played in junk bondsmight end up in this market,&quot; said Joseph Calhoun, abank-loan trader at M.J. Whitman andamp; Co., a New York brokeragefirm. Bank debt generally is the most senior claim against acompany, making it most likely to keep some of its value if acompany gets in trouble, Mr. Calhoun said. In contrast,high-yield junk bonds carry only a subordinate claim on acompany's assets, making them far riskier for investors.   For banks, the danger is a replay of the same pressuresfor portfolio markdowns that occurred a few years ago withtheir Third World loans, Keefe Bruyette's Mr. McDermott said.When trading of less-developed-country loans got started inthe mid-1980s, big commercial banks argued that traders'prices were far too low. Bankers insisted that market pricesdidn't reflect the real &quot;value&quot; of their loans to Argentina,Brazil and the like.   But as Third World debt trading grew, Mr. McDermott said,banks gradually stopped insisting that these loans werevalued at close to 100 cents on the dollar. Starting in 1987,big U.S. banks began taking loan-loss reserves thateventually approximated the market's cut-rate prices for suchloans.   ---         Some Bank Debt Sells At a Notable Discount                                                                                                        Here are recent indicative price quotes, in cents on thedollar, for leveraged companies' bank debt.
