The court said it will review a ruling that limited access byCanadian officials to financial records of two Canadian citizenswith bank accounts in Washington state.   The Canadian Department of National Revenue, the equivalent ofthe Internal Revenue Service here, sought records of Philip Stuartand Mons Kapoor. Both Canadian citizens have accounts with theNorthwestern Commercial Bank in Bellingham, Wash.   The Canadian officials said they are investigating the two men'stax liability for 1980, 1981 and 1982.   The officials sought the help of the U.S. government under a1942 treaty between the two nations, and the IRS issued summonsesto the bank in 1984.   Stuart and Kapoor then asked a federal judge to block thesummonses. The judge declined, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals ruled in their favor last year.   The appeals court ordered the bank records withheld unless U.S.officials state the Canadian tax investigation has not reached astage analogous to one in this country in which the IRS would referthe case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.   ``We do not believe that requiring the IRS to make such astatement will unduly restrict the service's summonsing authorityor impede enforcement of summonses,'' the appeals court said.   But administration lawyers said the ruling could hinder U.S.treaty obligations and impair the ability of investigators here toobtain foreign financial records.   The ruling ``requires a treaty partner's tax investigation tomeet standards grounded in domestic policies that have noapplication in the treaty partner's jurisdiction,'' thegovernment's appeal said.   ``It unnecessarily hinders investigations that the United Stateshas pledged by treaty to assist and that are entirely proper underthe laws of the treaty partner,'' the appeal added.   The United States has such tax treaties with 31 foreigngovernments and also exchanges information under other agreementsreached with Carribean Basin nations.   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.</TEXT></DOC>
