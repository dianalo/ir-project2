Robert Tappan Morris was indicted Wednesday in Syracuse, N.Y.,on a single count of illegally gaining access to at least fourcomputers and paralyzing their operations. He is scheduled to bearraigned before a U.S. magistrate Aug. 2.   The Justice Department said in a statement here that the caserepresents the first time that federal prosecutors have broughtcharges under a section of a 1986 law that prohibits unauthorizedcomputer access.   The indictment followed months of deliberations within theJustice Department about whether to bring felony or misdemeanorcharges against Morris, who was a student at Cornell Universitywhen the incident occurred Nov. 2.   The charge carries a maximum five-year sentence and a fine of upto $250,000. Morris, of Arnold, Md., could also be ordered to payrestitution to cover damages if he is convicted.   A computer industry group estimated that the virus infected6,200 computers and caused $96 million in damages. But a CornellUniversity panel that investigated the incident called the estimate``grossly exaggerated.''   The indictment stated that the virus caused damage of more than$1,000.   Defense lawyer Thomas A. Guidoboni said Morris would pleadinnocent.   The Cornell panel said the virus, or worm, affected thousands ofuniversity and military computers hooked up to the nationwideARPANET network used to transmit non-classified data. The networkwas shut down for several days, but no electronic files weredestroyed.   The panel said the incident was the result of ``a juvenile actthat ignored the clear potential consequences.'' But the commissionalso noted that ``it appears to have been an uncharacteristic actfor Morris,'' who graduated from Harvard last year before beginninga graduate program in computer science at Cornell.   Guidoboni said Morris, who has been on leave, has been given aone-year suspension from the university beginning in September.   Morris' father is chief computer scientist for the NationalComputer Security Center near Baltimore.   The indictment charged that Morris ``intentionally and withoutauthorization'' accessed computers at the University of Californiaat Berkeley; NASA at Moffett Field, Calif.; Purdue University inWest Lafayette, Ind.; the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command atWright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio; and others.</TEXT></DOC>
