H-M 10 catalyst showed a morestable activity as compared with the other two catalysts, H-M 20 andH-M 60. On the other hand the selectivity towards production of o- andp-xylenes is higher in case of H-M 20 and H-M 60 catalysts speciallyon increasing the time on-stream, i.e. the isomerization products overcomethe disproportionation and dealkylation reaction products.</TEXT></DOC>
