(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A periodical that summarizes unpublishedopinions from Kentucky's Court of Appeals and Supreme Court is beingmarketed by two appeals court judges who say there is nothingunethical about the venture.   About 50 subscriptions _ at $200 a year for law firms and $160for sole practitioners _ have been sold since the publication beganin September, said Judge Michael McDonald, who started the``Kentucky Legal Practitioner'' with Judge John P. Hayes.   McDonald said he and Hayes view the venture not as a moneymakerbut as ``a good way to get more of the work of Kentucky's appellatecourts into the hands of busy, practicing attorneys.''   The opinions summarized in the publication are ones the stateSupreme Court has decided are not worth having published in lawbooks. Unpublished opinions cannot be cited as precedents in othercases.   Experts on judicial ethics said they knew of no similarperiodical elsewhere in the country published by appellate judges.   Some lawyers and legal ethicists questioned the propriety of thejudges' venture, but McDonald said such questions were ``absolutelythe most absurd thing I have ever heard of.''   The Code of Judicial Conduct says a judge ``shall refrain fromfinancial and business dealings'' that tend to ``exploit hisjudicial position or involve him in frequent transactions withlawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which heserves.''   Judges may manage investments and ``engage in other remunerativeactivity,'' but should not serve as ``an officer, director, manager,advisor or employee of any business.''   Another portion of the code, however, says judges may speak,write, lecture or teach on legal subjects if, in doing so, theydon't cast doubt on their impartiality.   McDonald said he believes the summaries of unpublished opinionswill be ``extremely useful'' research tools.   Kentucky's appellate courts issue hundreds of decisions each yearbut most, by court order, are not published in law books when theCourt of Appeals decides they offer no new guidance on legal issues.   But some of the appellate judges have bridled under rules thatallow the Supreme Court to veto the lower court's decision that anopinion should be published.   In their first issue, the judges said they started the periodicalbecause the state Supreme Court had ``frustrated'' moves to allowlawyers to cite such unpublished opinions as precedent in arguingcases.   Experts on legal ethics said they believe it is improper forjudges to produce such a publication.   Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University said lawyers whoappear before the judges might feel pressure to subscribe to theservice, and that litigants represented by lawyers who don'tsubscribe might question the judges' impartiality.   Professor Geoffrey Hazard of Yale University said he thinks thepublication is improper because it requires the judges to summarizedecisions of their colleagues. ``You can't neutrally summarizeopinions,'' he said.   However, another leading ethicist, Professor Roald Rotunda of theUniversity of Illinois, said judges wouldn't automatically violatethe code in producing such a publication, as long as it doesn't takeup too much of their time.   McDonald said he spends less than an hour each week on theperiodical and former and current staff attorneys of the Court ofAppeals write the summaries at home in their spare time. He said nocourt equipment or supplies are used.   The Hayes-McDonald enterprise offers subscribers the full text ofopinions for 75 cents a page. Such opinions may be obtained directlyfrom the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals by mail for 30 cents apage.</TEXT></DOC>
