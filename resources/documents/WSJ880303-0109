Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   Here's how to turn the tables on a banker: Demand to see his financial statement.    Soon, most banks will have to provide data on their financial health to anyone who asks. The idea is to enable customers to diagnose a bank's illness before it fails. But some critics say the disclosures don't go far enough.    About 13,500 state and national banks regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the Currency are to begin disclosure reports by March 31. The Federal Reserve Board is expected to require the 1,000 banks that it oversees to do likewise by year's end.    The FDIC and Comptroller's rules require banks to give customers, on request, certain figures that they now report to regulators. Included in that data will be three key indicators: asset quality (bad loans), capital and earnings. FDIC analyst John Quinn says a bank that is losing money could be in trouble if its bad loans approach the size of its loan-loss reserves and if its capital is depleted. (The FDIC requires equity capital and loan-loss reserves to exceed 5.5% of assets plus loan-loss reserves.)    The banks' reports to regulators are dauntingly complex. Yet most banks are expected to simply copy their reports, even though they will be allowed to include explanations. They fear that any explanation will be misinterpreted by consumers, make the bank look bad or open it to lawsuits over something omitted.    The banking industry has resisted any disclosure rules on the ground that they would sow confusion. William Bosies, a lawyer for the American Bankers Association, says one publication ranks banks by their ratio of problem loans to assets, without considering capital, reserves, collateral, or other offsetting factors. Such analyses, he says, &quot;may rank banks who have a bad quarter with those that are in real trouble.&quot;    The bankers' deepest fear is that misunderstanding will lead to deposit runs. Yet in small towns, owners of closely held banks worry that neighbors will understand all too well. People won't like it &quot;if the bank is making money while nobody else is,&quot; says Diane Casey, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association of America, a Washington-based trade group.    But some consumer activists say the disclosure rules don't go far enough. Facing bitter protests from bankers, the FDIC and the Comptroller retreated from proposals to make banks disclose all enforcement actions against them. Though some banks already report such actions to the Securities and Exchange Commission, small banks feared such disclosures could drive off depositors.    William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, says the agency's board changed this provision because it was too burdensome and might have created problems for small banks. The final rule simply says that regulators can force banks to disclose enforcement actions. In the past, however, regulators rarely have disclosed such actions, except to shareholders.    The regulators also dropped the idea of disclosing insider loans, in part because of bankers' argument that a rural bank's limited pool of potential directors is likely to include many loan customers. Consumer activists argue that such loans should be disclosed to show whether bank money is going to executives' cronies.    Uninsured depositors, of course, have the biggest stake in knowing the condition of their banks. But so few depositors get caught uninsured these days that it isn't clear whether many consumers will use the disclosure rules. Last year, depositors lost access to less than 1% of the $9.5 billion in deposits caught in failing banks. Though the FDIC insures only the first $100,000 that a person holds in a bank, depositors using multiple banks can keep unlimited sums insured.    Former FDIC Chairman William Isaac, before leaving the post in 1985, pushed for broad disclosure together with some cutbacks in insurance coverage -- for instance, on deposits made by investment firms for a client, which often add up to huge sums spread over many banks. He claims that doing both would force the industry's &quot;highfliers, the risk takers&quot; to rein in or face deposit runs. But Congress balked at all proposals to curb deposit insurance.    &quot;Unless depositors are going to be placed at risk in some fashion,&quot; Mr. Isaac says, &quot;then disclosure is irrelevant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
