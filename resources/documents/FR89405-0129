The Act requires such mapsto be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties inthe local community, government agencies and persons using the airport.An airport operator who has submitted a noise exposure map that has beenfound by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal AviationRegulation (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act,may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forththe measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existingnoncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additionalnoncompatible uses.The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and relateddescriptions submitted by the Spokane Airport Board. The specific mapsunder consideration are Exhibits 5-8 and 5-14 in the submission. The FAAhas determined that these maps for Spokane International Airport are incompliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effectiveon April 18, 1989. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposuremaps is limited to the determination that the maps were developed in accordancewith the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determinationdoes not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans,or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund theimplementation of that program.If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific propertiesto noise exposure contours depicted on noise exposure maps submitted undersection 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involvedin any way in determining the relative locations of specific propertieswith regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noiseexposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which propertiesshould be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functionsare inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilitiesof local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in anyway under Part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore,the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contoursonto the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively withthe airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agenciesand planning agencies with which consultation is required under section103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airportoperator, under section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily requiredconsultation has been accomplished.Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, andthe proposed noise compatibility program are available for examinationat the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Federal Aviation Administration, Independence Avenue, SW., Room 615,Washington, DC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Federal Aviation Administration, Airports Division, ANM-600, 17900Pacific Hwy S., C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Spokane International Airport, Spokane, Washington.</ITAG>Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading,<T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Seattle, Washington, April 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James R.
