Of course, that prediction has been made before -- and not come true. But the effects of tax overhaul, just beginning to sink in, are shocking many people. &quot;They've seen their tax bills go up, in some cases dramatically,&quot; says Joel Isaacson, personal-financial planning director at New York-based accountants Weber-Lipshie andamp; Co.    And these taxpayers are now facing the future with new resolve. The idea: not to get hit quite so hard this year as last. If they start today, says Matthew Kessler, a tax partner at the Grant Thornton accounting firm, &quot;there's still plenty of time to do some real tax planning.&quot;    In fact, there are eight months left in which to get the job done. With that in mind, here are some ideas that accountants consider especially worthwhile.    CHANGING RULES   The maximum tax rate for most people dropped on Jan. 1 to 28% from 38.5%. That's the good news. Here's the bad: A number of deductions are being phased out over the next few years and will be of much less value in 1988 than they were in 1987.    Among the hardest hit, according to Mr. Isaacson, are deductions for personal interest payments, such as interest paid on credit cards, car loans and student loans.    In 1987, taxpayers could deduct 65% of those payments; this year it drops to 40%. As a result, Mr. Isaacson is recommending that clients with substantial personal interest &quot;pay off some of those debts in full.&quot;    Similarly, William Goldberg, director of financial planning services for accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., notes that &quot;a lot of people are still carrying minimum-deposit life insurance policies.&quot; These policies allow a holder to borrow from the policy's cash value to pay the premiums. The policyholder then takes a deduction for the interest on the loan. Trouble is, the Internal Revenue Service classifies the interest as personal interest -- again, only 40% deductible. Mr. Goldberg suggests exchanging such policies for those that are paid directly by the consumer.    Most of these changes were built in to the original 1986 tax-overhaul law. But the Revenue Act of 1987, enacted last December, brought new revisions to that law. Says Mr. Isaacson: &quot;Many people haven't focused on those changes yet.&quot;    Last year, for example, borrowers could generally take interest deductions on home-equity loans of any size, as long as the loans did not exceed the cost of the home, plus improvements. But the 1987 act puts a $100,000 cap on the total loan size for most taxpayers -- and that may trip them up, says Mr. Isaacson: &quot;If they're not careful, they'll get burned by refinancing above what's now deductible.&quot;    CLASSIC APPROACH   Many people believe that once the presidential election is over, lawmakers will vote in higher tax rates. According to Grant Thornton tax partner Thomas Ochsenschlager, &quot;There's a strong fear out there, particularly among high-income executives with salary deferral plans, that rates will go back up to as much as 50%.&quot;    Consequently, says Mr. Ochsenchlager, a number of executives may plan &quot;to take a lot of cash now,&quot; a move that could be attractive given &quot;the squirrelly way the rates work this year.&quot;    Indeed, picking up extra income in 1988 might shift some executives into a lower tax bracket. That's because high-income taxpayers are hit with a 33% tax -- the 28% technical maximum, plus a 5% surcharge -- once their adjusted-gross income rises to certain levels. But once it reaches another trigger point, it drops back down to 28%. For a married executive with a $175,000 salary and two children, the rate returns to 28% when adjusted-gross income, which includes both earnings and investments, tops $192,930.    Other advisers, however, say their clients are betting on a return to preferential treatment for long-term capital gains, now considered regular income. &quot;A lot of people,&quot; says Mr. Isaacson, are &quot;postponing gains that would be taxed at 33%.&quot;    One classic approach to tax planning still recommended by accountants is having clients defer current income and accelerate deductible expenses. Bunching together into one year as many expenses as possible can be especially rewarding. The reason: There are minimum levels beneath which certain expenses can't be deducted. Employee business and other miscellaneous expenses, for instance, have to exceed 2% of adjusted-gross income to be deductible. And medical expenses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of that figure.    &quot;If one kid needs braces this year, the cost might not get you over the 7.5% limit,&quot; says Mr. Ochsenschlager. &quot;But if all three will eventually need braces anyway, get 'em all down to the orthodontist.&quot;    KIDDIE TAX   The bite of the &quot;kiddie tax,&quot; which applies to children under age 14 with investment income, has surprised a lot of parents, according to Wallace Head, director of personal financial-planning services for Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.    Indeed, one of Mr. Head's clients had a seven-year-old daughter with taxable investment income of $1,236 last year; she was hit with a $339 tax bill. Meanwhile, the man's 16-year-old daughter, who had $2,002 of taxable investment income, owed only $230. The disparity occurred because younger kids with unearned income over $1,000 are taxed at the parents' rate. But children 14 and older are taxed at their own rates.    That being the case, some parents may want to buy their children investments that don't thow off income, or at least not much. Mr. Head suggests moving &quot;from, say, taxable bonds into zero-coupon municipals that mature when the kids turn 14, savings bonds or low-dividend-paying stocks or mutual funds.&quot;    PASSIVE LOSSES   Under tax overhaul, investors with old tax shelters are seeing the value of the losses produced by those &quot;passive&quot; investments dwindle. This year, only 40% of the losses can be used to offset salary or portfolio income -- down from 65% in 1987. The rest has to be used against passive income.    One way to handle this reduction is to load up on passive-income generators -- real estate and other kinds of limited partnerships marketed by syndicators and brokerage firms for just that purpose.    Mr. Isaacson, however, is steering his clients away from those investments. &quot;A lot of the ones we're seeing aren't that great,&quot; he says. Many people buying them, he adds, &quot;are throwing good money after bad.&quot;    Another solution is to try to make passive investments active. As Grant Thornton's Mr. Kessler points out, &quot;The key is that there's no limit on the amount of active losses that reduce other income.&quot;    According to the IRS, a taxpayer generally would have to put more than 500 hours a year into an activity to make its losses active -- and for many people that simply isn't practical. An investor in a large public partnership, for example, has virtually no chance of taking an active managerial position. Still, investors in small private syndications and businesses -- say, a silent partner in the family shoe shop -- might be able to put in the necessary hours. According to Mr. Thornton, those people should &quot;look at the regulations to determine what they want to do under them to make themselves active or passive participants in 1988.&quot;    ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX   What many taxpayers fear most (besides an audit) is getting hit with the alternative minimum tax. When that tax is triggered, individuals invariably end up paying more total taxes under far harsher rules.    Because of tax overhaul, more people are having to calculate their taxes both ways to see if they're subject to the minimum tax. According to Vernon Martens, a senior tax attorney in the tax advisory group at brokerage firm Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., anyone on the borderline last year should make &quot;projections for 1988 to see whether they're (again) going to have a minimum-tax problem.&quot;    If so, they'll probably want to take evasive action by, for instance, giving cash, rather than appreciated property, to charity; by declining to exercise incentive stock options; and by steering clear of certain types of municipals bonds, the so-called minimum-tax bonds. These are all considered &quot;preference items&quot; -- the kind most likely to unleash on the unwary the bite of the alternative-minimum tax levy.
