The resistance charge is emerging as its central argument tojustify an escalation of the war in Cambodia, despite the absenceof any hard evidence of a large-scale plan by the Vietnamese armyto remain in Cambodia.   Vietnam said the last of its forces will be out of Cambodia,which it invaded in late 1978, by midnight today. But officials ofall three major resistance groups characterize the pullout as anelaborate hoax.   ``The Vietnamese will not withdraw from Cambodia,'' said PrinceNorodom Rannaridth in a recent interview. ``We are not fighting acivil war. It will remain a war to liberate Cambodia fromVietnamese occupation.''   The prince leads the army loyal to his father, Prince NorodomSihanouk, who heads a loose coalition which also includes the KhmerRouge and the non-communist Khmer People's National LiberationFront.   The Sihanoukists charge that more than 30,000 Vietnamese havealready been disguised as troops or militia of the Phnom Penhgovernment or as Vietnamese civilians living in the country. Othersare operating in remote areas as regular Vietnamese troops, theyclaim.   Khmer Rouge radio claimed in a recent broadcast that the numberof disguised Vietnamese troops is 110,000.   While the resistance and defectors fleeing to the Thai-Cambodianborder often cite specific units and figures where the subterfugeis supposedly occurring, Western analysts following developments inCambodia are still uncertain.   ``I have heard many reports of Vietnamese disguised as PhnomPenh troops, but we cannot confirm anything,'' one analyst said.``I am not saying it isn't happening but we have no proof.''   ``All they (the resistance) need is one piece of hard evidence,one captured document or officer,'' said another Cambodia watcher.``But until then nobody will believe them. Nobody exceptCambodians, who are always ready to believe in the worst intentionsof the Vietnamese.''   Cambodia experts point out that a total Vietnamese pullout wouldgreatly undermine the resistance battle cry that they are fightingtheir historic enemies, the Vietnamese, and preventing them from``swallowing the country.''   But should there be truth in the resistance claims, Vietnamwould jeopardize its sorely needed economic assistance fromnon-communist nations which have shunned it since the invasion.   Hanoi hopes the withdrawal will end its isolation.   The resistance groups say disguised Vietnamese units are usedonly to support government troops who are faring poorly in combatagainst their fighters.   ``The Vietnamese are in (Cambodian Prime Minister) Hun Senuniforms. I have seen many of them,'' said 25-year-old Mao Souen, adefector from the Phnom Penh army. ``In my unit there were sixVietnamese experts. They are in Hun Sen uniforms like me. Beforethey were in Vietnamese uniforms, but three months ago theyswitched.''   The chief military analyst of the Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front, Dr. Abdul Gaffar, said a number of disguisedVietnamese were fighting in Pailin. Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penhtroops are reportedly locked in fierce battle for the gem-rich,Thai-Cambodian border town.   Gaffar said two regiments of Hanoi's 330th Division had beenintegrated into Phnom Penh's 92nd Division while three otherVietnamese regiments had shed their own uniforms.   The resistance also points to Vietnamese civilians living inCambodia as proof of Hanoi's intention to colonize their country.It places the number of these settlers at 1.25 million. Vietnameseofficials say there are only 80,000 while some Western diplomatsestimate 200,000.   Most are shopkeepers, skilled workers and fishermen. Many haveleft or are leaving, fearing for their safety after the Vietnamesemilitary shield is withdrawn.</TEXT></DOC>
