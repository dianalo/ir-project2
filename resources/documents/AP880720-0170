(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's spokesman saidWednesday the administration was not surprised by lingeringskirmishes in the Iran-Iraq war, voicing hope that it is merely aprelude to a cease-fire.   ``The fighting, of course, is continuing there, as I thinkeveryone assumed it would,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Briefing reporters at his seaside resort while Reagan continuedhis week-long vacation, Fitzwater said, ``I think everyone assumedit would continue until the cease-fire. ... So I think we shouldall assume that the war is receding and we can expect skirmishesuntil the cease-fire is agreed to.''   Fitzwater commented not long after United Nations SecretaryGeneral Javier Perez de Cuellar announced he was dispatching a teamto Iran and Iraq to seek implementation of a ceasefire under U.N.Security Council Resolution 598.   Iran's government had announced Monday for the first time thatit was unconditionally accepting the cease-fire resolution. But onTuesday, Iraq bombed an Iranian nuclear power plant and hit otherIranian industrial targets.   Fitzwater said the administration welcomed Iraq's move to holddirect talks with Iran as soon as possible on establishing acease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war.   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, made the proposal ina message to Perez de Cuellar.   On another matter, Fitzwater reiterated that the United Statesis interested in improving relations with Iran, but he said this isnot related to the continued captivity of eight Americans heldhostage by pro-Iranian elements in Iran.   The spokesman said the administration was continuing to doeverything possible to win the release of the hostages but said``we don't believe there should be any linkage'' of thehostage-holding with the possible renewal of contacts with Iraniangovernment officials.   ``We have had that signal out for a number of months ... andwhenever we have pressed them for names or assurances that therewere authoritative persons (with whom the U.S. could do business),we didn't hear back,'' he said.   Fitzwater said he thought that it had been ``at least a coupleof months'' since the United States made any attempt at directcontacts with Iranian officials.   ``We have continued to say that we're open to it, but it is upto Iran, and that's where the ball is now,'' he said.   Fitzwater has said in the past that the United States insists ondealing with Iranians who can speak authoritatively for therevolutionary goverment of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   The spokesman said U.S. officials would have to be convinced ofthe legitimacy of any Iranians who might be contacted because theadministration wants no repetitions of the Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
