The official Tass news agency said a curfew was in effect Sundaynight. Residents flew black flags of mourning, troops and tanksreportedly patrolled the streets, and activists called for ageneral strike.   One activist said 50 people died in the clash in Lenin Square.   Tension has been building in Georgia since Tuesday, whenthousands of hunger strikers and protesters began pressing demandsfor independence from the Soviet Union. Georgian nationalistscontend that under Moscow's central control, Russians haveencroached on their culture, language, politics and economy.   They also accuse the Kremlin of fomenting unrest among Georgia'sethnic Abkhazians, who are demanding more autonomy.   Georgia is the third Soviet republic where authorities havebrought in troops and tanks to quell disturbances in the past year.Similar measures were taken to quell ethnic unrest last year in therepublics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.   In an attempt to prevent future unrest, the Soviet Presidium onSaturday passed a decree making it illegal to insult or discreditthe government. It also mandated fines and prison terms for thosewho call for the overthrow of the government, among other things.   On Sunday, authorities imposed an 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew andbanned public gatherings to end the protests, said ZurabZhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group in Tbilisi. Hesaid the demonstrators went home when the curfew took effect andstreets were deserted except for patrolling troops and tanks.   Ms. Archvadze and another activist estimated 10,000 people werein Lenin Square when soldiers moved in at 3 a.m.   She said said her information came from her brother-in-law,Svyad Gammsachurdia, also a member of the Watch Committee, whowitnessed the clash. He was arrested at his home several hourslater, she said.   Tass said local officials ordered troops to clear the squareafter protest organizers ``began to declare plans to seize power.''   ``They kindled inter-ethnic strife and called for theelimination of Soviet power in Georgia, the creation of aprovisional government of the republic and its withdrawal from theU.S.S.R.,'' Tass said.   The Interior Ministry said troops and soldiers followed ordersnot to use weapons, ``but some extremists armed with rocks, sticksand metal objects offered fierce resistance,'' Tass said. ``Theiractions caused a crush in the crowd and as a result, 16 peopledied.''   Georgian television reported at least 100 people were injured,said a duty officer at the city executive committee.   Tass said the injured included 75 soldiers and policemen.   Zhankarashvili said tanks and busloads of soldiers appearedsuddenly and attacked the crowd with clubs and small shovels.Youths in the crowd used stones, flagpoles and whatever they couldfind to fight back, he said.   A handful of Georgian policemen on the scene defended theprotesters against the Soviet troops, Zhankarashvili said. He said50 people died and 500 were injured.   The Popular Front of Georgia is calling for a general strike onMonday to protest the killings, Zhankarashvili said, ``because it'snot possible to organize demonstrations and this is the only formof protest we have left.''   Unofficial sources said many soldiers and tanks were still inthe streets, and there were reports more were arriving in the cityof 1.2 million, about 1,100 miles southeast of Moscow.   Authorities detained at least five activists, their relativessaid. The five were among the leaders of the pro-independencerallies and were identified as Gammsachurdia; Georgy Chanturia,chairman of the National Democratic Party of Georgia, which startedthe hunger strike; Irina Sarishvili, a spokeswoman for that group;and Mirab Kostava and Irakly Batryashvili.   The protests were planned to lead up to the 11th anniversary ofa 1978 protest that succeeded in destroying plans to drop Georgianas the republic's official language.   No violence was reported in Tbilisi before Friday. But someviolence was reported in outlying areas last week betweenAbkhazians and Georgians.   Many of the nations more than 100 ethnic groups have takenadvantage of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,or openness, to demand greater autonomy in cultural, economic andpolitical affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
