But trustee Daniel L. Bakst, a West Palm Beach, Fla., lawyer,said he will not let the 11th-hour settlement efforts interferewith his assignment to track down Warner's assets for distributionto creditors.   ``Mr. Warner wants to stop me,'' Bakst said in an interview withThe Cincinnati Post published Tuesday. ``Just because Warner isflopping around trying to make deals doesn't mean I can't do myjob. We are going forward.''   Warner, 70, who owned the failed Home State Savings Bank ofCincinnati, had filed in October 1987 a petition for protectionfrom his creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.Warner, who now lives in Ocala, Fla., and filed the petition inU.S. Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Fla., sought protection fromcreditors seeking more than $4 billion from him.   Home State's March 1985 collapse precipitated a crisis amongOhio thrifts. Warner's creditors include the state of Ohio, whichobtained a March 1987 court order that Warner pay back to the state$22 million needed to guarantee Home State deposits.   Warner, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was convictedon Ohio felony charges in Home State's collapse, but was acquittedof federal charges in a separate trial. He is appealing the Ohioconvictions.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor on Friday authorizedappointment of Bakst as trustee. On Monday, Proctor signed an orderthat converted Warner's Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7proceeding. Bakst is to conduct a meeting of lawyers for Warner andthe creditors Aug. 24 in Jacksonville.   Warner, reached by phone at his Ocala home Tuesday, declinedcomment. However, he told a newspaper in his Florida home town thathe is not trying to impede any court proceeding.   ``During all of this litigation I have never impeded any of theproper procedures in any way,'' Warner told the Ocala Star-Banner.He declined to comment further.   One of Warner's lawyers, Andrew Hall of Miami, Fla., confirmedTuesday that Warner is trying to settle the case. Hall said he didnot know the amount of money Warner is offering.   ``There is a very substantial offer being made,'' Hall said. ``Iunderstand they're working on it. If they work this out, it's allover.''   Hall said any settlement would have to be approved by the judgeand then would be subject to acceptance by his creditors.   Lawrence Kane Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio's special prosecutor inthe Home State case, declined comment on any settlementpossibilities. Proctor ruled in August 1988 that Warner'sbankruptcy reorganization would not allow him to avoid payingrestitution to Ohio. Kane said that judgment would not be affectedby any Warner settlement.   ``There is no one who can compromise that judgment,'' Kane said.``That debt is still outstanding, and we intend to collect it.''</TEXT></DOC>
