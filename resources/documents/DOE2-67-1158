A discussion is given of how disruptive current profilesare correlated with the experimentally known operational limits in densityand current. It is argued that the q{sub a} = 2 limit is connected withstabilization of the m = 2/n = 1 tearing mode for 2 andless; q{sub a} {approx_lt}2.7 by resistive walls and mode rotation. Experimental and theoreticalobservations indicate that major disruptions usually occur in at leasttwo phases, first a ``predisruption'', or loss of confinement in theregion 1 andless; q andless; 2, leaving the q {approx_equal} 1 region almost unaffected,followed by a final disruption of the central part, interpreted hereas a toroidal n = 1 external kink mode. 68 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
