BSN bought the United Kingdom biscuit business of NabiscoBrands; British snack food makers Walker's Crisps and Smith'sCrisps; The Belin Group, a French biscuit and pastry business; andSaiwa, a biscuit and snack producer in Italy.   The five European companies had pretax profit of $137 million onsales of $1.2 billion in 1988.   RJR Nabisco put the European units on the block last month,saying the sales would be part of an effort to reduce the company'soverall debt by about $5.5 billion.   In the wake of its $24.5 billion takeover by Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co., completed earlier this year, RJR has annual interestpayments of about $3 billion.   The company has been expected to sell several assets in anattempt to reduce that debt.   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in SanFrancisco who follows RJR, said the BSN deal demonstrates thatthere should be eager customers for any RJR units made available.   ``This indicates that, indeed, the RJR properties are hotproperties,'' he said. ``It is one thing to project that, andanother to actually see it.''   BSN and RJR are ranked one and two, respectively, in the biscuitand snack food business in France, Goldman said, and the dealreinforces BSN's powerhouse status at home.   BSN did not have a major presence in the United Kingdom, thoughRJR Nabisco did, Goldman added. ``All of a sudden, they (BSN) are abig player in the British snack market,'' he said.   BSN markets a variety of biscuit, dairy and grocery products, aswell as beer, champagne and mineral water.   ``BSN has acquired five attractive food businesses, eachpossessing strong brands, distribution and sales systems,manufacturing facilities and management,'' RJR Chairman Louis V.Gerstner Jr. said.   ``As part of BSN, one of Europe's premier food and beveragecompanies, these businesses should continue to develop andprosper,'' he said.   Gerstner said the sale, while helping RJR reduce its debt, willnot diminish the company's competitive standing.   ``The size and strength of our food businesses in North Americacontinue to place RJR Nabisco among the world's leading cookie,cracker and snack producers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
