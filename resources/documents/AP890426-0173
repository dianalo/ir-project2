(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 400 to 450 people rallied Wednesdayat the state Capitol to protest Chippewa Indian treaty rights thatallow them to spearfish off their reservations before anyone elseis allowed to fish.   While protesters gathered outside, more than a dozen businesspeople from northern Wisconsin urged state officials to do act onthe spearfishing issue before the annual spring ritual permanentludamages the tourism industry.   ``Northern Wisconsin, be it just or not, is perceived as afishless and a raciallly bigoted vacation land,'' said JohnSprister, a resort owner. ``You've got our lives in your hands.Don't drag this thing out.''   The protesters object to the Chippewa being allowed to leavetheir reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and othertrophy-sized fish on public lakes before rod-and-reel season begins.   The Indians' spearing season began Sunday and on Tuesday oneband was met at lakes by hundreds of protesters, three of whom werearrested Tuesday.   The Indians' treaty rights on fishing, hunting and gatheringfood plants were upheld in 1983 by a federal court.   The businesssmen said they did not doubt the sincerity ofAttorney General Don Hanaway and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson in tryingto negotiate a settlement with the Chippewa, but that the publicdid not realize what they were doing.   ``I'm sure you people are working night and day on this, but theperception is that nothing is being done,'' campground owner AlVehrs said.   ``The efforts are not in question here. It's the results ofthose efforts that we're not satisfied with,'' said Jim Galloway,president of the Boulder Junction Chamber of Commerce.   The 1983 ruling on the tribe's fishing rights came in a suitfiled on behalf of the tribe 15 years ago. Parts of the suit, onsuch issues as timber rights, are still unresolved.   Hanaway said public officials need the help of business leadersto convince the people of northern Wisconsin that the case wouldtake an additional five or six years to resolve in court, and thata negotiated settlement is the only way to quickly resolve theissue.   Tribal members are expected to spear only about 30,000 fish thisspring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch ofabout 800,000 fish annually in northern Wisconsin.   Hanaway also said northern Wisconsin was being falsely labelledas a racist area because of the protests against spearfishing.``The fact is that there is racism, but it's by a very, very tinyminority,'' he said.   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1983 that therights the Chippewa retained to hunt, fish and gather on publiclands off their reservations in roughly the northern third of thestate had not been extinguished by later treaties or other federalactions.   Since then, U.S. District Court rulings have defined broadtreaty rights for the state's roughly 18,000 Chippewa Indians,including the right to a ``modest'' standard of living from fish,game and timber on public lands.</TEXT></DOC>
