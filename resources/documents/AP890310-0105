(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell today told the 2,000employees of his religious empire that they will be required to bemembers of his church and donate 10 percent of their income to it.   ``We're not changing anything, we're just reinforcing what hasbeen a policy for two decades,'' the independent Baptist preachertold workers for Liberty University, Old-Time Gospel Hour, LynchburgChristian Academy, Liberty Godparent Home, Liberty BroadcastingNetwork and Thomas Road Baptist Church.   ``The purpose of this is not numbers and money, but coordinationof vision and teamwork,'' Falwell said.   Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss did not immediately return atelephone inquiry about the timing of Falwell's statements. But theaction was announced shortly after Falwell unveiled more detailedplans for a new $30 million 10,000-seat church near the LibertyUniverty campus. The new facility won't be ready until at least1991, Falwell said.   Falwell said all full-time workers at his ministry will besubjected to the tithing policy as of July 1. The policy fallswithin the limits of the law as interpreted by the U.S. SupremeCourt in a Mormon case, Falwell said.   But he said the workers should be motivated by faith into tithing.   ``If this is something you in your heart can't do, it would bebetter for you to not be a member of this team, rather than beforced to serve God here,'' Falwell said.   Falwell said some exceptions will be approved. For example, someteachers at his schools are pastors of their own churches; they havebeen exempt from the church membership and tithing policies in thepast.   ``We're not talking about Gestapo methods,'' Falwell said. ``Butwe cannot move ahead without getting our camps together, and this isthe year we're doing it. I felt the need to once again verbalize thevision.''   If all Falwell employees tithe 10 percent, it will balance thebooks of Thomas Road Baptist Church, he said.   The 33-year-old ministry has a $35 million payroll and a churchbudget of $3.5 million, exactly 10 percent of the payroll, Falwellsaid.   Before today's meeting, ministry officials said, tithing andchurch membership were required of employees of Liberty Universityand Liberty Christian Academy.</TEXT></DOC>
