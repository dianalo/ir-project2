The company was underconsideration for inclusion in a NIOSH study of health hazards in thepainting industry. Approximately 41 of the employees at the facilitywere assigned to the painting-operations area surveyed. The company hadno formal safety and industrial-hygiene program. Medical first-aid serviceswere provided by a resident nurse and industrial-hygiene services werefurnished by an insurance company on a request basis. Personnel recordsprovided demographic information and work positions. The authors concludethat due to the small number of employees exposed to paint vapors andmists at the facility, an in-depth industrial-hygiene study is not applicable.They recommend that the facility be considered for further studies inview of the type of painting operations employed at the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
