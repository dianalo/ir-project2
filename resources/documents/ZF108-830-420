JansonandM;MIS managers seem to agree that data is more secure on LANs than on othernetworks, with benefits ranging from better data backup and data control toincreased reliability of data over time.andM;Keystone Group Inc., a Boston-based mutual-funds company, achieved betterdata backup after decentralization efforts, said William Parsons, KeystoneGroup's vice president and quantitative analyst.andM;&quot;We're a lot happier with our present backup than with mainframes andnine-track tapes,&quot; he said.andM;No longer is Keystone's data stored on magnetic tapes that can degrade overtime, but on optical disks with longer life spans, Parsons said.andM;&quot;We're a lot more confident now that 10 years from now, we'll be able to readthe data,&quot; he said.andM;Data access and confidentiality also improved at Payco American Corp. afterthe Brookfield, Wis., debt-collection agency moved human-resources benefitsand payroll applications from its mainframe to a LAN, said Brion Henes,manager of special systems.andM;Before decentralization, the firm's data-processing operations were locatedin a different building than corporate headquarters.andP;  Production reports wentfrom operations to mailroom personnel to programmers before reaching theirdestination, according to Henes.andM;Now reports are produced by the users at their desks, he said.andP;  Because thoseusers are in the corporate building, they can hand-deliver information to thepeople who need it, he said.andM;Most MIS managers were enthusiastic about data security and backup on theLAN, but one sees remote LAN management as a big headache.andM;Six months ago, the City of Long Beach, Calif., moved its towing applicationoff an IBM 3090 mainframe onto five remote sites connected via a Novell LAN,said Office Systems Officer Terry Evans.andM;Towing Department employees wanted more immediate access to data supplied bythe Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in Sacramento, Calif., according toEvans.andM;Although the remote-site LAN users are now getting their data more quickly,the downsizing has become a &quot;network-administration nightmare,&quot; Evans said.andM;&quot;This LAN requires three times more work&quot; for the MIS team, which spends fromfour to eight hours a week troubleshooting at remote sites, he added.andP;  &quot;We'vegotten calls at 3:00 in the morning.&quot;andM;Yet when it comes to security, Evans neatly summed it up.andP;  &quot;Security is onlyas secure as the users,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You can't protect the system from whatusers do with it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
