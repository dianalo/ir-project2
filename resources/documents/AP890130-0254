The calls to the National Futures Association hotline _ which areup to about 630 a day _ reflect how investors who feel they may havebeen cheated by commodities traders are anxiously watching thefederal investigation.   ``It's been very busy around here, I can say that,'' said TonyRose, the director of the hotline.   The two-year investigation at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange andChicago Board of Trade involves allegations that as many as 100brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millionsof dollars.   Some market watchers say investor reaction to the burgeoningscandal could vary, partly because there is no real indication whomay have been cheated or for how much.   The action on the floors of the Merc and Board of Trade is arapid, chaotic process involving traders and brokers who representindividual investors, pool investors, banks, investment firms,multi-national corporations, farmers and argicultural merchants.   ``To the extent that there are victims, they would be the publiccustomers ...a doctor, a lawyer, an Indian chief, John Q. Public,''saidStephen Selig, a commodities law professor at New YorkUniversity and former chairman of the New York Bar Association'scommittee on futures regulation. ``They either paid more than theyshould have when they bought, or got a lower price than they shouldhave when they sold.''   For example, suppose an investor puts in an order to buy soybeansat the market price. At the time the trader receives the order, theprice of soybeans is $7 a bushel and moving higher.   The trader is bound by law to execute the customer's order beforetrading for his own account. But an unscrupulous trader could buyfor his own account at $7 a bushel and sell the soybeans to fill thecustomer's order at $7.01 a bushel moments later.   Although traders are suspected of raising the price only by aquarter-cent or half-cent when skimming illegal profits, investorssay the difference adds up.   ``When I was a buyer, I felt the fill (or an order) they gave mewas a cent above the market,'' said Jim Lovdahl, president ofMonmouth Grain and Dryer Co. in western Illinois. But his lossestotaled more than one cent.   ``For example, on 100,000 bushels, that would be $1,000,''Lovdahl said.   Gary Martin, president of the Peoria-based Ostrum Martin Inc.grain elevator company, said, ``It's like I've got a guy shoveling abarrel of corn and what does it hurt if he takes a handful out ofeach shovelful? Well it does hurt.''   Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the large Decatur-based agriculturalconcern whose complaints reportedly led to the federalinvestigation, repeatedly has refused to talk about its role.   Other large interests, such as the investment firm Dean WitterReynolds Inc., are concerned about possible losses, but are waitingfor more information before pointing fingers, said Dean Witterspokesman Jim Flynn.   At the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agencythat regulates the futures markets, officials said it was too earlyto pinpoint who may have been burned by futures traders.   ``Hypothetically it could come off the back of the little oldlady in tennis shoes who lives in Des Moines, ...but it's hard tosay a farmer, or a little old lady or a dentist in Peoria or ADMitself got hurt,'' said CFTC spokesman David Gary.</TEXT></DOC>
