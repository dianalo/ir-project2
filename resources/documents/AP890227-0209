Of 329 applications submitted here, seven have been approved forasylum since Tuesday, when the Immigration and NaturalizationService sped up its procedures for handling asylum applications.   Under the new procedures, all applications are processed in asingle day, but those whose applications are rejected are subject toimmediate arrest and detention and are marked for deportation.   All seven approved for refugee status are from Nicaragua, saidVirginia Kice, spokeswoman for the agency's Harlingen District atthe southern tip of Texas.   Political asylum is granted to people who are judged to befleeing persecution. The INS instituted its new policy because itbelieves most of the emigrants are traveling to the United Statesfor economic reasons.   The number of applicants has plunged since the new get-toughprocedure began. INS examiners processed 233 last Tuesday, 51Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 19 Friday and 16 Monday.   Two weeks ago, when applicants still were able to travel on totheir U.S. destinations to pursue their cases, the agency was seeing500 a day.   Things have slowed down so much that some of the extra personnelbrought in last week to carry out the new procedures went homeMonday, said Al De Leon, assistant district director forexaminations. Twenty-six examiners left Monday, he said, leaving 24here to process cases.   One of two State Department personnel on hand since last week toissue advisory opinions on the cases left Thursday, according to theINS.   Sixteen cases processed Monday resulted in 11 denials of asylum,four approvals and one notice of ``intent to deny,'' meaning thatperson was given 15 days to supply improved documentation to bolstera borderline case.   An exact number of people affected by the decisions wasunavailable because dependants sometimes file jointly with theprincipal applicant, Ms. Kice said.   The number of people detained as a result of the new procedurewas unavailable, but the inmate count at an immigration servicedetention center on Monday was double the population of a week ago.</TEXT></DOC>
