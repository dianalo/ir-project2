WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid tribute toPresident Reagan on Wednesday for retracting his characterizationof the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' but he blamed theAmerican side for the failure to make more tangible progress at thefourth superpower summit in 30 months.   In the first nationally televised Moscow news conference by aKremlin leader, Gorbachev hailed the continuing U.S.-Sovietdialogue and said ``it is vitally necessary'' that his meetingsresume after Reagan's successor takes office in January.   In a good-natured, wide-ranging session with Soviet and foreignreporters, the Communist Party chief held forth for nearly twohours, alternately praising the tone of U.S.-Soviet dialogue whilecriticizing specific U.S. positions.   Gorbachev noted that ``within the walls of the Kremlin, next tothe Czar's gun, right in the heart of the evil empire,'' Reagan hadresponded, ``No,'' when asked if the Soviet Union still deservedthe appellation he gave it in March 1983.   Reagan explained Tuesday that his characterization, one of themost-quoted of Reagan's presidency, was made in ``another time,another era.''   ``We take note of this,'' Gorbachev said, drawing on an ancientGreek saying to add, ``Everything flows, everything changes.''   Gorbachev said his meetings with Reagan were ``in-depth and attimes intense discussions right up to the last minutes.''   He described the talks as respectful and productive, butindicated emotions ran high at times, saying he and Reagan were``standing up at the table'' to make their points.   ``I think that the meetings once again demonstrated the factthat we are indulging in realistic dialogue,'' the 57-year-oldSoviet leader said.   Gorbachev said he believed a treaty cutting strategic nuclearweapons by 30 percent to 50 percent was still possible this year,despite the failure to break the logjam that has blocked progresstoward an agreement since the Washington summit last December.   Asked if he expected to meet Reagan again before the presidentleaves office, Gorbachev said it was unlikely unless there is anunforeseen breakthrough in the strategic arms talks.   He said the United States rejected several Soviet proposals forinclusion in a 24-page joint statement issued on conclusion of thetalks.   Both sides agreed there should be no war between them, yet theAmericans objected to describing their goal as ``peacefulcoexistence,'' or even ``coexistence,'' Gorbachev said.   Gorbachev's remarks were contained in a 50-minute openingstatement followed by a question-and-answer session that ran aboutan hour with questioners picked by Foreign Ministry spokesmanGennady I. Gerasimov from a show of hands of some 300 Soviet andforeign journalists.   The general secretary reiterated his criticism of ousted Moscowparty boss Boris Yeltsin, a one-time protege, and dismissedYeltsin's suggestion that the Kremlin's No. 2 man, Yegor Ligachev,should resign.   Last October, at a closed meeting of the Communist Party'spolicy-making Central Committee, Yeltsin criticized the slow paceof perestroika, Gorbachev's campaign to modernize the Sovieteconomy and society, and offered to resign. Gorbachev saidWednesday that his one-time protege, who had risen to non-votingmembership on the ruling Politburo, was overruled by fellow membersof the Central Committee.   He said he had not seen Yeltsin's recent comments in interviewswith Western television networks but would ``demand from ComradeYeltsin explanations as to what it is all about and what he isafter.''   As for Ligachev and reports he was being pushed from power,Gorbachev said ``no such problem exists'' with the man widelyperceived as the leader of a conservative faction opposingGorbachev in the Politburo.   ``Perestroika will win out,'' he said of speculation that thereform movement could be in trouble. He also said he had heard noalternative to his reforms and concluded, ``There can be somemaneuvers ... but we have undertaken irreversible change.''   Gorbachev, sitting at a table with key members of his summitnegotiating team, dominated the session with a self-confident air.Speaking off the cuff much of the time, he made his pointsgesturing with his hands and flashing a smile.   At one point, when he realized that some American correspondentscouldn't understand because their translation devices weren'tfunctioning, he directed a good-natured reorganization of theseating, telling Soviet reporters to take chairs where theearphones weren't working.   Many reporters, including NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, whom Gorbachevsingled out by name, stood up and switched seats in thejust-renovated auditorium in the Soviet Foreign Ministry presscenter.   The party chief indicated that the United States and SovietUnion had made a recent breakthrough in long-stalled conventionalarms talks in Europe but accused the United States of``incomprehensible maneuvers'' that scuttled any mention of that inthe closing communique.   Asked about the prospects for a fifth summit, Gorbachev said,``I like the possibility for a meeting with just one problem, if wehave an opportunity to achieve a treaty concerning offensivearms.'' He said the president's Strategic Defense Initiative wasone sure obstacle, along with a dispute over limits onsubmarine-launched cruise missiles.   Later he said he told Reagan the president's view that theso-called Star Wars program is strictly defensive was ``just notserious.''   Asked about the Middle East, Gorbachev said for the first timethat as soon as an international conference on the region isconvened, ``we are prepared to address ourselves to regularizingrelations with Israel,'' severed in 1967.   He cited the Afghanistan agreement as an example of what couldbe achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring partiesto solve the conflicts, but noted that if Soviet forces now comeunder attack from rebels as they withdraw, ``we shall reactaccordingly and appropriately.''   On human rights, he said that when Reagan ``tried to persuade meto change my mind, I said, `Your explanations are not convincing... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit.'''   Reagan met with a group of dissidents and refuseniks during hisfive-day visit here but scrapped a plan to visit a family ofwould-be Jewish emigrants. Sources said the Soviets warned U.S.officials the family would never be permitted to leave the countryif the Reagans followed through with their plan.   After talking of what he called the contrary attitude of theUnited States on some issues, Gorbachev singled out economicrelations.   ``Authoritative parts of American business circles would like todo business,'' he said. ``They are faced with intimidation and allsorts of restrictions.''   He cited the Jackson-Vanik Amendment which links tradeopportunities to emigration freedoms and said he told the president:   ``Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living? ...The amendment was passed in totally different circumstances adecade ago. We should base our policies on present-day realities.''   As he has before, Gorbachev described the agreement to eliminateintermediate range (INF) nuclear weapons as ``a watershed politicalevent in the Soviet-American dialogue.''   Earlier, in remarks at the exchange of final INF papers, theSoviet leader summarized the proceedings as ``big politics ...worthy of new times.''   ``The era of nuclear disarmament has begun,'' Gorbachev said.   In his news conference statement, Gorbachev was sharply criticalof the U.S. stand on reducing the non-nuclear forces in Europe ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.   He said Reagan had rejected a Soviet proposal to exchange dataon the troops as a first step toward a massive reduction, but ``theother side immediately tried to dodge the issue.''   Gorbachev said the United States engaged in ``incomprehensiblemaneuvers'' and ``we missed a chance to take an important stepforward to a civil relationship.''</TEXT></DOC>
