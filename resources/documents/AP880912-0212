And that original production was good enough to lead tosuccessful Broadway revues of music by Eubie Blake (``Eubie'') andDuke Ellington (``Sophisticated Ladies'').   Other members of the original Broadway cast _ Nell Carter,Armelia McQueen, Charlaine Woodard, Andre De Shields and Ken Page _are at the Ambassador Theater, again singing songs that the latecomposer-pianist-singer Fats Waller made into hits. Henderson sitsin for Waller at the upright piano.   ``There have been many extraordinarily good casts,'' Hendersonsays. ``But none of them generate the kind of electricity that thisgroup does. This show has taken on a deeper dimension. I don't knowif that's visible to everybody. The singers are doing the samething they did before and as great as it was, it seems to be betternow. I think I'm playing better now.   ``What we were attempting, and I think we do, is to capture, becustodians of and illuminate the spirit of Fats Waller,'' Hendersonsays. ``We're not just giving lip service to songs like `T'ain'tNobody's Biz-ness If I Do' and his saying, `One never know, doone.' It's for fun.''   One song, ``Black and Blue,'' isn't intended to be funny, butsometimes the audience laughs as the song begins. The laughtertrails off as they realize it's serious.   ``All of a sudden, Fats, who's telling everybody your feet's toobig and this man is fat and greasy and being the buffoon _ forwhich he got a lot of flack in his lifetime _ decides to create avery strong protest song,'' Henderson says. ``People have beenhaving such a good time they can't believe right away he's notkidding.''   ``Ain't Misbehavin''' has been touring, drawing audiencessteadily over 10 years, with different casts. Leonard Oxley andBilly McDaniels, who've done the show often, currently play pianoon Tuesday nights and Wednesday matinees, when Henderson is off.   Henderson confesses that he really doesn't play like FatsWaller, ``except in certain things.''   ``I use some of his stride piano idioms,'' he says. ``Stride is`oom pah,' a rhythmic background effect, like a band. Fats wasexuberant and he showed it in his percussiveness. He was able to dostride with his left hand and play other stuff up in the right hand.   ``In the late 1930s and early 1940s the art of stride pianoplaying, and boogie-woogie, were incredible. I can tell you theyare very difficult to do.''   Henderson was hired as arranger when ``Ain't Misbehavin'''started as a musical revue at the off-Broadway Manhattan TheaterClub. ``The orchestra is built around the piano,'' he says. ``Fatsnever had a band. He called it Fats Waller and his rhythm. He useda drummer, bassist and sometimes a guitarist.'' Later, Hendersonreluctantly agreed to play on-stage piano as well.   Henderson, a Juilliard School graduate, decided early in life toconcentrate on arranging instead of composing or performing. He wasintimidated by the great jazz pianists then working. ``I alwaystell people I was frightened by Art Tatum at an early age,'' hesays. ``Then Oscar Peterson came along.''   He composed the music for an off-Broadway musical comedy,``Crystal Tree.'' ``I'm not a bad composer,'' he says, ``but that'ssomething you can't do offhand. You have to do it every day; it'snot a part-time job.''   When he arranges, Henderson says, he starts with pinning downwhat is to be communicated. ``When I get a job like `Miss TeenU.S.A.' for TV, I don't need to go into that depth. I justgenerally do because that's how I got brought up. When I get thesegigs, I work twice as hard as anybody else.''   Henderson recently arranged two albums, of Dixieland andGershwin music, for the Canadian Brass. ``There is nothing in thosetwo hours of music that is improvised and they say Dixieland shouldbe improvised.   ``I think I was successful. It's the essence of what Dixielandmight have been if they'd all had the technique these boys havegot. I strive for that _ the essence _ a lot.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
