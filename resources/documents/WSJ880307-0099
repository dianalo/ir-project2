Mr. Bush received 48% of the vote, while Sen. Robert Dole trailed with 21%, former television evangelist Pat Robertson got 19%, and Rep. Jack Kemp received 11.5%. Mr. Bush took all 37 of the state's Republican Party convention delegates.    The outcome was bitter medicine for all three of the losers. For Mr. Dole, it marked the last chance to stop the vice president's momentum before Super Tuesday, on which Mr. Bush now conceivably could win all 17 GOP contests. For Mr. Robertson, who once said he would win the South Carolina primary, it meant a dismal third-place finish. For Mr. Kemp, it meant probably the end of his presidential campaign.    Separately, the Democratic caucus in Wyoming Saturday failed to produce a clear-cut winner. Sen. Albert Gore finished in a virtual tie with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, while Rep. Richard Gephardt came in a close third. These three Democrats also are hotly contesting most of the 20 Democratic contests on Super Tuesday, with the added element of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is expected to do especially well in his native South.    In the Wyoming Republican caucus, Messrs. Dole and Bush split the delegates evenly.    William Brock, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, declined yesterday to identify any state that Mr. Dole might win next and instead looked beyond the contests in the South to predict Dole strength in the Illinois primary next week.    &quot;We're going to compete across this country because Bob Dole's strength is that he is a national, not a regional, candidate and that he runs much stronger in terms of the November election than George Bush does,&quot; Mr. Brock said on CBS-TV's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; &quot;We're in for the long haul. We think we're going all the way to the convention.&quot;    But Mr. Bush, after learning the South Carolina results, said the die had been cast. &quot;Even though we're locked in a close race, these results are going to help. I believe I will be the next president of the United States,&quot; he said. Mr. Kemp, whose fourth-place showing in South Carolina came after an all-out effort there to get his presidential campaign off the ground, is expected to bow out after tomorrow's contests.    Discussing the Democratic race on ABC-TV's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; yesterday, Mr. Gore said the undecided vote is breaking in his favor in Southern Super Tuesday states because of his strong showing in Wyoming. He said he will outpoll Mr. Jackson, who has strong support, particularly among the South's black voters. Mr. Jackson, who also appeared on the ABC program, refused to make predictions about his own showing. </TEXT></DOC>
