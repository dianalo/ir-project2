The steam-front propagation velocity andtemperature field ahead of and behind the condensation front were notsignificantly different for steam injection into partially saturatedor dry media compared with injection into a water-saturated medium. Significantdifferences in measured parameters were observed during steam displacementof a 1 wt% surfactant solution. The steam-phase mobility decreased upstreamof the condensation front by factors of 5.7 and 14 under conditions wherenoncondensable gases were not present and present as an initial gas saturation,respectively. These results clearly indicate that foam is produced duringsteam displacement of a surfactant solution without the presence of anoncendensable gas. Furthermore, noncondensable gas in the porous matrixwas immobilized by the surfactant and aided in the stabilization of thefoam in the steam zone.</TEXT></DOC>
