U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that theSmokeless Tobacco Act is ``clear and unequivocal'' in itsrequirement that all advertising for smokeless tobacco _ exceptbillboards _ carry warnings the products may cause mouth cancer,gum disease or tooth loss.   Jackson ordered the Federal Trade Commission to reviseregulations that had also exempted promotional items such asT-shirts, promotional banners, coffee mugs and caps, from therequirement.   The judge stayed his order, however, to give the FTC anopportunity to appeal the decision.   Jackson ruled that the exemption given by the FTC to promotionalitems undercut the clear intent of Congress in passing the law.   ``If vendors of smokeless tobacco products are able to put theirwares before prospective consumers, bare of warning labels onT-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, beverage coolers, and the like, as apractical matter they may effectively frustrate the purpose of thewarning label requirements by doing most of their advertising with`utilitarian' giveaways,'' Jackson said in an opinion dated May 20but made public Wednesday.   Jackson made the ruling in a lawsuit brought last year by theAmerican Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, theAmerican Lung Association and the Public Health Association.</TEXT></DOC>
