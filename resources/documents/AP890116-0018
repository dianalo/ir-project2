Hodel is leavingWashington convinced that leaders of environmental organizations aremuch too partisan and out of touch with their members.   Hodel also said in a farewell interview that he believes theglobal warming called the ``greenhouse effect'' has been overblown,and the cost of cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons plants hasbeen overstated.   Hodel said he was ``delighted and astounded'' that the losingDemocratic campaign of Michael Dukakis argued, in Hodel's words,that ``you don't have to choose between an improving environment andan adequate energy and minerals supply; you can do both'' _ his ownposition.   The environmentalists who attacked President Reagan's firstinterior secretary, James Watt, whom Hodel served as deputy, were``the anti-can-do-both'' people, Hodel said.   Hodel often has been called a smoother version of Watt, followingthe same policies but without the rancor. Asked if he were a ``Wattpolicy clone,'' he replied, ``I hope so, because we worked for thesame man,'' Ronald Reagan.   Watt's critics ``were the people who said we had to choosebetween improving our environment and the lifestyle of the Americanpeople. They were the ones who had foisted the idea off on theCarter administration that we were going to have to live with less,that there was a malaise in the country, that the United States'glory days were behind us.''   Hodel said many leaders of environmental organizations ``made ahorrible mistake'' when they endorsed Carter for re-election in aWhite House Rose Garden ceremony in 1980.   ``I think if their membership understood how blatantly partisanthe paid leadership was, the membership would demand that somethingbe done,'' Hodel said.   Few environmental leaders made an endorsement in thejust-concluded campaign, though some attacked the record of theReagan administration and George Bush.   The leaders are ``single-issue people,'' Hodel said, but ``thebulk of the membership really does believe we can do both. They areresponsible, dedicated supporters of wildlife, clean air, cleanwater and the environment.''   Hodel's complaint was scoffed at by two environmentalorganizations.   ``When I joined the Wilderness Society in January 1981, the samemonth the Reagan administration took office, we had 40,000 members.We now have 240,000,'' said former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., thesociety's counselor.   ``Every single environmental organization in the United Stateshas significantly increased its membership,'' Nelson said.   Dave Baker, political director of Friends of the Earth, said,``Our membership votes with their dollars. ... I think ourmembership does believe you can do both (enhance the economy andprotect the environment), but I don't think Don Hodel and theadministration have done much to promote that.''   Hodel, however, insisted that self-styled public interest groupshave been taken over by ``single-issue politicians.''   He said that in the early 1980s it was clear that the impendingrelease of much natural gas from price controls would mean fallingprices because demand had fallen below production.   ``The consumer lobby continued to insist that price controls werenecessary to `protect the consumer.' And I don't think it hadanything to do with `protecting the consumer.' It has to do with aregulatory frame of mind that these people have, which is: They wantthe government, which they as single-interest politicians caninfluence, in control of the market because then they can skew itfor their purposes when they need to.''   Some gas was decontrolled and prices did fall. The Reaganadministration has not succeeded in persuading Congress to free theremaining 40 percent of gas still under controls.   Hodel said he believes that nuclear waste cleanup costs faced bythe Energy Department probably have been overstated.   ``When you hear $360 billion estimates or whatever the number is,that includes cleanup way beyond what is necessary for health andsafety,'' he said.   The Energy Department has estimated it needs $81 billion through2010 for cleanup and modernization.   Hodel also discounts the worst-case scenarios offered for thegreenhouse effect.   He said he thinks that ``the global warming is primarilyoccurring because of long-range global or universal orsolar-system-wide effects, and we will find that the human inputdefinitely has an effect, but that is not nearly so great'' as theinitial estimates.   Many scientists argue that the global warming produced by carbondioxide results mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. They say ithas increased average temperatures by nearly one degree Fahrenheitover the past century and is likely to increase temperatures threeto eight degrees by sometime in the middle of the next century,raising sea levels, increasing droughts and shifting crop productionzones.</TEXT></DOC>
