But the Air Force disputes conclusions by the congressionalGeneral Accounting Office that it still ``has not been able to meettraining and readiness objectives'' for the B-1.   ``Reliability shortfalls _ parts failing faster than expected _continue to be a major cause of spare parts shortages,'' GAO saidin a study released by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of theArmed Services Committee and a chief congressional critic of the7-year-old bomber.   Aspin and other critics say the B-1 isn't working as well as theAir Force said it would. The Air Force says the plane is performingas expected and says most problems thus far have been common bugsexperienced by all new weapons systems.   President Reagan resurrected the B-1 in 1981, four years afterit was killed by President Carter, and ordered the Air Force to buy100 of the planes for use in the nation's arsenal of long-rangeweapons.   The GAO report was released Saturday by Aspin, a week afteranother Congressional Budget Office study also made public by Aspinsaid improvements to the B-1 could cost up to $3.4 billion.   Capt. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for the service, maintained thatthe Air Force is ``making steady progress in assuring adequatespare parts are available.''   ``The most important point is that the B-1B is performing itsdeterrent mission right now,'' said DeFrank. ``Today, B-1B aircrafthave trained crews and fly the necessary sorties to meet wartimerequirements.   ``The Air Force has steadily improved the planned rate of B-1Btraining flights and expects that trend to continue as the systemmatures and spare parts are delivered.''   The GAO did say the Air Force is doing a better job than in 1987.   ``The Air Force's and contractor's attention to priority partshas resolved some parts problems, but a more systematic approachwould ensure early and appropriate attention to the problemparts,'' the study said.   If there were shortages of spare parts affecting trainingflights, those shortages could also affect the number of planesavailable during wartime, Aspin noted.   ``Alert status is the bomber's reason for being. If that'sadversely affected _ and it is here _ then you've got problems,''he said.   The last B-1 was delivered April 30. The Air Force says theentire program will cost $27.3 billion, excluding improvements.   The B-1 will be used in conjunction with the so-called``stealth'' B-2 bomber to replace aging B-52s as the country'sfleet of long-range nuclear bombers.</TEXT></DOC>
