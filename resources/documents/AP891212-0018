Counting Monday's dismissals, management of the South AfricanTransportation Services has fired more than 11,000 of the 16,000workers who walked out in a wage dispute on Nov. 2. Virtually allof them are black.   The workers want the minimum monthly wage increased from $225 to$560. The strikers also are demanding the company formallyrecognize their union, the South African Railway and Harbor WorkersUnion.   Management has refused to enter wage talks, saying a pay hikewas negotiated earlier this year.   Whites employed by the 170,000-worker company make significantlymore money for the most part and dominate administrative andsupervisory posts.   At least four people have been killed in strike-related violenceand there have been several arson and sabotage attacks that thecompany has blamed on strikers. Police said a 10-car train derailedSunday night in Natal Province, the second such incident in fourdays.   Police and the company said the rail lines had been tamperedwith.   Company officials say damage to property during the strikeexceeds $8 million. But they say their rail and harbor operationshave not been seriously affected by the walkout, which is illegalunder legislation that bars strikes against essential services.</TEXT></DOC>
