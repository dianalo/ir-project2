They said the man was questioned about alleged attempts toblackmail a computer company but that there was not enough evidenceto pursue the matter.   ``He was officially cautioned about that but, as he wasn'tcharged with anything, we are not identifying him,'' said aspokeswoman at Scotland Yard.   A Scotland Yard statement said only that the man was 23 and outof work. It said the inquiry by its Serious Crimes Squad lastedfive weeks.   The Sunday Telegraph, which broke the story, said the man wasconnected with an ``international ring of computer hackers who havepenetrated the electronic information systems of more than 200sensitive military and commercial establishments.''   It said the computer systems penetrated included NASA, the U.S.Nuclear Defense Agency, the British Defense Ministry, ``as well asthose of American defense establishments and suppliers.''   The weekly said American security experts were going to Londonto examine papers found during the police investigation which gavedetails of hacking activities over five years.   The newspaper said the man used computers on the University ofSurrey campus at Guildford, 30 miles southwest of London, and hadnot committed any offense under British law.   It said the man's hacking included finding out details ofpeople's financial accounts and that his motive appeared to havebeen the ``pleasure of beating the system.''   It reported he had contacts with unidentified hacking clubs inthe United States and with one in West Germany ``which specializesin gaining access to military systems. But there is no suggestionthat he tried to disclose secrets to foreign countries,'' thereport added.   The newspaper said the alleged blackmail attempt originated witha request to a large computer firm for a $5,250 fee to be shown howits equipment had been used to tap different computer systems.
