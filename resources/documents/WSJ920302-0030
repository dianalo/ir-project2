Walter J. Hickel has begun a legal assault onthe federal government meant to weaken the powerful gripfederal agencies have on much of state's rich load of naturalresources.   The governor announced late last week that the state fileda lawsuit in federal court in Anchorage challenging federalmanagement policies for various Alaska rivers, bays and otherwaterways. It is the first in what Mr. Hickel, a staunchadvocate of developing natural resources, has promised willbe a string of lawsuits attacking U.S. resource agencies. Thegovernor contends that such agencies as the National ParkService, the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Serviceare locking away too much of the state's valuable oil,timber, minerals, fisheries and other resources.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hickel's intention is to win the state more power todevelop the resources, force the agencies to develop themmore aggressively or make the federal government pay Alaskafor revenue the state says it's losing as a result of federalrestrictions. That could amount to billions of dollars, thegovernor's staff says.   The outcome of the governor's legal crusade won't be knownfor years, and some resource attorneys think it is quixotic.Still, because of Alaska's unique position as the repositoryof some of the nation's last great stores of economicallyimportant raw materials, as well as much of its remainingwilderness, the legal campaign will be closely watched byenvironmentalists and pro-development groups across thecountry.   Some environmentalists are already alarmed about whatmight happen if the governor succeeds in court. &quot;In general,the federal agencies have acted more strongly to protectnatural resources than the state,&quot; said Tom Waldo, a staffattorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in Anchorage.&quot;In particular, we don't feel that Gov. Hickel has been afriend of the environment.&quot; Beyond that, a court victory forAlaska would invite similar challenges to the resourceagencies' authority in other states.   In the initial suit, the state alleges that federalagencies managing certain Alaska waterways and landsadjoining them, including the rich and scenic Glacier Bayarea, have improperly restricted commercial fishing and otheractivities. The suit charges that the agencies' actionsviolate both the federal Alaska National Lands ConservationAct and the Alaska Statehood Compact, the agreement thatgoverned Alaska's entry into the union in 1959.   The suit names as plaintiffs the Secretary of the Interiorand the Secretary of Agriculture, among others. An InteriorDepartment spokesman said the agency has been negotiatingwith the state over the issue and hopes to come to someagreement, but added that &quot;the governor is trying to forcethe issue, and that isn't going to get it resolved anysooner.&quot; None of the other plaintiffs could be reached forcomment. The governor has said the state also intends to suethe government over the ban on exporting North Slope crudeoil, and has promised other lawsuits attacking variousaspects of federal management of land and resources inAlaska. A spokesman for the governor said some of theadditional suits will be filed in a matter of weeks.   The federal government owns about 212 million of Alaska's365 million acres of land, including such environmentallysensitive areas as the 17 million acre Tongass NationalForest and the 19 million acre Arctic National WildlifeRefuge. Federal environmental regulations have put much ofthe Tongass off limits to loggers, and Congress recentlyrebuffed another effort by the oil industry to gain clearanceto drill for the huge oil deposits ANWR may hold. An aide tothe governor cited both areas as examples where federalcontrols may have deprived Alaska of billions of dollars ofpotential royalties, fees and other revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
