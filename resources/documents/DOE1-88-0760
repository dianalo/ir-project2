Post-INFEurope thus finds itself at a crossroads - with one path leading to deepeneddetente, an increasingly pan-Europeanized economy, and a new common-securityorder, and the other leading to what could amount to a mere reshufflingof the Cold War cards in Europe. How all this plays out depends partly,of course, on the direction of US policy. More than in Europe, wheredeepened detente seems to hold an answer to Europe's security future,thinking in Washington is anchored to the increasingly anachronisticrules of the postwar world. The notion of the Soviet threat dies hard,as does the notion of America's preeminent leadership position in NATO.Thus, the US faces the danger that the current gap in US-European thinkingwill only widen and that Washington, blind to the real basis of thisrift, will act in a way that will both complicate Europe's search fora new security order and work to decouple the United States from Europepolitically and economically.</TEXT></DOC>
