 Headcountreductions of almost 25% took place over the years, with another 10,000slated to be cut this year.andP;  At the end of 1984 ATandamp;T had 365,000 employees;today it has 280,000 !andP;  Market lossandM;* An equal access program was imposed through regulation and judicial decreewhich, by simply existing, almost assured the erosion of ATandamp;T's market share.andO;Since 1985, according to the FCC, ATandamp;T's market share in interstate switchedtraffic dropped from 80% to 66%.andM;Market shrinksandM;*  The PBX market turned stingy  - as customers stuck to the old, slowerreplacement cycles of the 1970s and shunned highly featured switches forthose with lower costs per line.andP;  It's as if they were still assimilating theswitch to electronic stored program control technology.andP;  The damage done whenATandamp;T instituted its PBX migration strategy in the 1970s  - and ATandamp;T lost 20points of market share to Rolm, Northern Telecom, Mitel, and others  has beenslow in repair.andM;Computers slumpandM;* The computer market  - one of the main targets of divestiture  entered aslump the year of divestiture and may have permanently changed tosingle-digit growth.andM;Base lackingandM;* The international market grew hot aU of a sudden  - and here was ATandamp;T, oneof the largest information systems suppliers in the world, with a minusculeinternational base.andM;Leader lostandM;*  The visionary company leader, Charles Brown, died suddenly andunexpectedly.andM;Quite a gauntlet.andP;  No wonder plenty of people in the company still wonder ifdivestiture was worth it.andM;But divestiture was not only worth it, it HAD to happen.andP;  Those write-offsATandamp;T took and those headcount reductions at ATandamp;T (and the RBOCs) over thelast five years were overdue.andP;  Technology had made the need for a &quot;naturalmonopoly&quot; in telecommunications obsolete, even if the regulators and judicialsystem hadn't.andP;  Once technology provided economies of scale to largecustomers and sharing and resale became a real business, the monopoly gamewas over.andM;So ATandamp;T shucked off the real utility portion of its business, the localexchanges, where there was still some intrinsic need for natural monopoly&quot;  -but one related more to rights of way and embedded telephone plant, ratherthan to standards.andM;Catchup in the technology raceandM;In the 1970s and 1980s technology and markets raced ahead of ATandamp;T.andP;  But inthe 1990s it looks like ATandamp;T is catching up.andP;  ATandamp;T is still one of the fewplayers that can, of its own volition, expand overall markets, rather thanjust fend off competitors picking at its base.andP;  And new market demand wouldbe welcome in this era of flattening communications markets.andM;Given all that, there's much to be thankful for in some of the recentmilestone events.andM;Perhaps the biggest milestone was passed in ATandamp;T's Data Systems Division,where last year revenues reached $2.1 billion, according to the Wall StreetJournal and where, were it not for corporate overhead allocations, thedivision made a profit.andM;Revenues grew 30% and are expected to grow 20% this year.andP;  That's a far cryfrom the $1 billion loss in 1986 and the cumulative $3 billion in lossesexperienced since divestiture.andM;Major achievementsandM;But ATandamp;T's successes are not merely financial.andP;  They are also in:andM;*  Strategy: with its third or fourth strategy for penetrating the computermarket announced last year, it looks like ATandamp;T has finally latched onto onethat can win.andP;  The company will target systems integration with open systems,aim its salesforce at more defined market targets, beef up its PC dealerchannel, and concentrate on getting some more big name accounts.andM;*  Product: the company is now reselling PC's built by Intel, and demand hasbeen such that ATandamp;T is now manufacturing some on its own; the company is soonto announce a high availability transaction processing system based onPyramid systems.andP;  i.e., ATandamp;T is beefing up its product technology fast.andM;*  Accounts: last year ATandamp;T landed some major accounts, including Pizza Hut,American Airlines, and the U.S.andP;  Department of Transportation.andP;  Although ATandamp;Thad previously won some big government contracts  - based mostly on itsmastery of Unix andandM;systems integration  - last year's hits showed a diversity and capabilityheretofore unwitnessed.andM;*  Unix: ATandamp;T managed to keep the Open Software Foundation at bay by givingthe industry access to Unix System V development efforts, first throughsupport for the formation of Unix International, a development consortium.andO;The company now plans to support partial divestiture of its Unix SoftwareOperations so others can buy equity in it.andM;A player at lastandM;In short, after all these years, ATandamp;T has finally become a player.andP;  At $2billion it will be far behind EBM, Digital, Apple, Unisys, and some others inthe business  - but it's clearly got some upward running room.andM;ATandamp;T has done well elsewhere in its business.andP;  Last year for the first timeit made over $1 billion in international sales of network equipment, forinstance.andP;  If ATandamp;T can grow its international equipment and services businessto the same percentage level as aandM;Digital or IBM, it could grow another $10 billion right off the bat.andP;  Thecompany also restructured into 19 business units, each of which must stand onits own.andP;  Although it has to be shown that this autonomy will be backed bydivestiture of bad performing units, it has signaled to investors, anyway,that ATandamp;T is ready to start making money again.andM;Revenue grows, but net income leapsandM;And here's another milestone; ATandamp;T's net income for 1989 rose 19% on revenuegrowth of 3%.andP;  The company is now a $36 billion company  - and would, infact, be a $50 billion company if access charges weren't netted out.andP;  What'smore, during the year its stock price rose and its cash remained in goodshape.andM;But perhaps most impressive is ATandamp;T's revenue per employee.andP;  In 1984 it was$91,000.andP;  By last year it was  128,000.andP;  The company may still not be theleanest and meanest in the industry, but it's at least respectable now.andM;At the moment most of ATandamp;T's vital signs look good.andP;  It has enough cash toride out a bad economy, if, in fact, the doomsayers are right about 1990.andO;And it still has an aggressive hold on its crown jewel, the long distancemarket.andM;There are some other ways in addition to those mentioned that make it looklike ATandamp;T is in for some longer term good news:andM;Experience countsandM;* ATandamp;T's experience  - in systems integration and Tariff- 12 and Tariff-15work  - will support its strategy to be a solutions vendor.andP;  Very fewcompanies that would LIKE to be big in systems integration can boast thatkind of track record.andP;  And in studies conducted on systems integration byTFS, one of the main critical success factors at the business is experience.andM;Margins secureandM;* The switch to price cap regulation will allow ATandamp;T to increase profits onwhat is already the lucrative side of its business.andP;  Competition will putsome pressure on margins, but there is still lots of territory untouched bythe MCIs and Sprints of the world.andM;Culture opens to customersandM;* ATandamp;T's culture is slowly coming around to embrace an emphasis on customerneeds.andP;  Despite all the recent organizational changes, the company issettling down.andP;  Employees are getting used to the idea of organizationalchange  - it happens every 18 months or so at competitors  - and beginning tosee the opportunity it brings.andM;Playing to strengthsandM;* Hard times in a market  - as it looks like the computer, PBX, and U.S.andO;central office switch markets are heading  - ask of a company many of thethings that ATandamp;T has in abundance.andP;  Management experience, financial systemsand controls, capital, and reputation.andM;The right stuffandM;* The next cycle of PBX acquisitions is coming up, and early indications arethat this time users are buying on quality and reputation, ISDN capability,and service and support, not simply price per line.andP;  This means ATandamp;T will bein good position when PBX systems shipments start to pick back up.andM;For most users the immediate impact of an energized ATandamp;T will be slight  -since ATandamp;T is the vendor of choice in many areas, anyway.andP;  But the Tariff- 12arrangements suggest that doing business with ATandamp;T will be cleaner andquicker and more satisfying.andM;Help the market, raise the tideandM;Of course that doesn't mean that the competition will go downhill.andP;  If ATandamp;Tcan pump some electricity into the market  - by showing it ways to make moneyor save costs through the technology and service it sells  - then others willbenefit as well.andP;  A rising tide raises all boats.andM;The last place you'll see all this change will be in the conduct of yourdaily business  - in which the attitude, skill, and experience of your actualATandamp;T rep counts for more than all the technology and strategy in the world.andO;If he's as energized as his corporate sponsor, then divestiture will truly bebehind us.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
