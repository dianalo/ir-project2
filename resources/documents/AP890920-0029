SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Planning ahead is the key to hurricane safety,and with Hurricane Hugo posing a threat to the United States,residents of coastal areas may want to consider how to cope with thedanger.   The storm surge, a wall of water pushed ahead of these storms,poses perhaps the greatest threat, although high winds and floodingare also major hazards, weather experts warn.   For low-lying communities, evacuation is the safest measure, andofficials have warned that many fast growing communities lack plansand proper roads to get everyone to safety in the face of afast-approaching storm.   The time needed to evacuate many coastal areas is greater thanthe available warning time, the American Meteorological Society hassaid. And many people are complacent or unaware of the danger, with80 percent of the 40 million people living on the Atlantic and Gulfcoasts never having experienced a hurricane.   ``It is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike takethe threat seriously and acquaint themselves with hurricane safetyrules, and evacuate immediately if advised to do so,'' says RobertSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,Fla.   Safety suggestions compiled by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agencyinclude:   _Keep track of the developing weather through local radio andtelevision or NOAA Weather Radio, which broadcasts on specialfrequencies that can be received by inexpensive weather radios.   _Learn local evacuation routes and shelter locations. If in avulnerable area, be prepared to leave, and do so promptly ifauthorities recommend it.   _Keep the automobile fully fueled, and make a supply of freshwater, batteries and food is available.   _Tape, board and shutter windows and tie down mobile homes beforeleaving. Wedge sliding glass doors to prevent them from lifting offtheir tracks.   _Bring in pets.   _Anchor small boats or move them to a safe shelter if there istime.   _Secure outdoor objects that might be blown away and becomedangerous missiles. These include such things as garbage cans,garden tools, signs, porch furniture and so forth.   _Remain at home only if it is sturdy and not in an area subjectto flooding. If staying home, keep away from windows. Fillcontainers and bathtubs with several days supply of water.   _Avoid loose or dangling wires and report them immediately toyour power company. Report broken water mains, since low pressuremay hamper fire fighting.   After the storm has passed:   _Seek assistance if needed in Red Cross shelters.   _Stay away from disaster areas unless you are qualified to help.   _Be wary of fly-by-night repair services rushing into an area,collecting money for work and then disappearing or doing shoddyrepairs. Check references, and wait if necessary.   _Check refrigerated food for spoilage if the power has been off.</TEXT></DOC>
