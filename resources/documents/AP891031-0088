The house voted to hold the referendum Nov. 26, the date thathad tentatively been chosen for a popular vote to select apresident under an agreement signed by the ruling Socialist Partyand most of the major opposition groups.   But two opposition groups, the League of Free Democrats and theLeague of Young Democrats, had opposed that. They collected morethan 200,000 signatures on petitions calling for a referendum onthe method and timing of such elections.   The groups want the president chosen by parliament after thegeneral elections, which are to be held by June. They say they needmore time to organize an effective campaign to make theircandidates better known.   The agreement between the Socialists and most opposition groupshad called for a one-time popular vote to select a president, withparliament choosing all subsequent presidents.   If Hungarians vote in favor of electing a president before theparliamentary elections next year, the presidential balloting wouldbe conducted Jan. 7, the lawmakers decided today.   The presidency was created by constitutional amendments adoptedtwo weeks ago and the office's responsibilities include command ofthe armed forces and calling elections.   The Socialist Party is the successor to the Communist party,which dissolved itself at a congress this month. The Socialistspromise to end one-party rule and replace it with constitutionaldemocracy.   Hungarian legislators today also planned to discuss and vote ongovernment proposals on a suspended Danube river hydroelectricproject with Czechoslovakia. Hungary has been increasingly at oddswith that Warsaw Pact ally over the project's suspension andHungary's path of reform.   Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders have refused to ease theirtight control of society and allow any degree of power-sharing.   In declaring a moratorium in May on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros damproject, the Hungarian government expressed concern about potentialenviromental damage. Czechoslovakia has said it will continueconstruction and demand compensation if the Hungarians don't rejointhe project.   On Monday, Parliament overwhelmingly approved legislationcreating a state auditor's office to control government and partyfinances.   The laws, to take effect in November, were among several on theagenda on the opening day of Parliament's first session since itrewrote the Communist constitution to embrace democratic ideals.   At its previous session, which ended Oct. 20, Parliament adopteda series of laws and constitutional amendments establishing thelegal framework for the first multiparty elections since theCommunists consolidated power in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
