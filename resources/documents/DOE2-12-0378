<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0378 </DOCNO><TEXT>We point out intriguing connections between the chiral quark model inwhich the nucleon is treated as a soliton and the ordinary potential-bindingquark model. The axial-vector coupling comes out near the value (5/3rather than around 0.7 as in the Skyrme description and can be easily''fine-tuned'' to its experimental value. A ''linear potential'' in somesense is generated as a collective effect of the ''meson cloud.'' Contactwith QCD is made by introducing a gluonium field so as to satisfy thetrace-anomaly equation. In the simplest treatment of this field one predictsa scalar-isoscalar state at 900 MeV in agreement with a recent analysisof experiments. The model is used to discuss how a ''nontrivial windingnumber'' emerges for the meson fields. A number of additional featuresof the model are treated.</TEXT></DOC>
