To determine where the tincompounds interacted with the fungus cell, tin Moessbauer spectra ofthe treated cells, cell walls, and cellular organelles were measuredat 80K. The compounds examined included triphenyltin bromide, chloride,hydroxide, and iodide. The spectra of the whole cells were differentfrom the spectra of the solid tin compounds and exhibited two major lineswhose parameters were the same for all cells. This suggests that thetin compounds were bound to the cell as the triphenyltin fraction. Thesame spectrum appears with cell-wall fraction, and a weak signal is presentin the spectrum of treated cellular ractions. These results suggest thatthe tin compounds are bound to the cell walls.</TEXT></DOC>
