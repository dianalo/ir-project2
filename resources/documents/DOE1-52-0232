The NOD support staff no longer needed to be located in the companyheadquarters and was integrated into the Palisades Plant organization.In an attempt to understand the problems confronting the plant, the neworganization set up a group of meetings for each department to identifybarriers to becoming a high-performance organization. In addition tothe barrier meetings, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO)and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) assisted in identifyingadditional problem areas during their normal inspection. Support wasalso provided by INPO during an assist visit in early 1985. That assistvisit provided new ideas as well as impetus and credibility to many ofthe planned corrective actions determined from the barrier meetings.Corrective actions were collected, placed on a punch list, and workedoff over an 18-month period. The results of these actions have been encouraging.The number and significance of NRC violations and NPO findings have beenreduced. Radwaste generation and auxiliary building contamination havedecreased significantly. Costs have been reduced due to reductions instaff, contract services, and radioactive waste. The most significantimprovements have been in worker morale and increased cooperation fromother plant departments.</TEXT></DOC>
