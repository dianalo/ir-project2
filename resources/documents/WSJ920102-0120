North Korea's refusal to allow inspection of its nuclearfacilities, where South Korea, the U.S. and others saynuclear weapons research is continuing, has been the biggestbarrier to attracting foreign investment. The U.S., Japan andother nations have said that they wouldn't lend money toNorth Korea or make sizable investments there unlessinternational inspections were allowed. U.S. intelligenceagencies say that the hard-line Communist state could build adeliverable nuclear bomb by the middle of 1993.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We still don't know what is going on in the minds of theNorth Korea leadership,&quot; said a South Korean governmentanalyst. &quot;But it seems clearer now that its main motivationis economic.&quot;   Many South Korean and U.S. officials have always worriedthat North Korea is trying to delay inspection of its nuclearfacilities and will make gestures to buy itself time. Itstill isn't clear with this agreement whether internationalinspection, of the sort that was conducted recently in Iraq,will be allowed, analysts said.   However, North Korea took a major step by pledging that itwon't test, manufacture, produce, introduce, possess, store,deploy or use nuclear weapons. Moreover, it pledged not toreprocess or enrich nuclear fuel, a step needed for themanufacture of weapons-grade nuclear materials. South Koreahad made this pledge in early December. If the two countriesabide by their agreement, it would make the Korean peninsulaa nuclear-weapons free zone.   The problem of mutual inspection of North and South Koreannuclear facilities and military bases will be left up to ajoint &quot;nuclear control committee,&quot; which will set up therules and procedures. This could be done as early asmid-February, South Korean officials said. The two countries'prime ministers will initial the agreement at their nextmeeting Feb. 19.   To get Tuesday's agreement, South Korea had to drop itsdemand that North Korea sign, ratify and implement aninternational inspection treaty by Jan. 15. North Koreaagreed to issue a separate statement later pledging to signthe safeguards agreement with the International Atomic EnergyAgency and allow neutral inspections by the end of thismonth. North Korean officials said during the talks thatsigning the safeguards agreement is a matter between it andthe IAEA and it did not want to appear to sign the safeguardsmeasure under pressure.   South Korea has been consulting closely with its mainallies, the U.S. and Japan, about its talks with North Korea.President Bush is expected to affirm U.S. support for SouthKorea's initiatives during his state visit to Seoul Jan. 5.Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Seoul Jan. 16,when he will discuss Japan's efforts to improve relationswith Pyongyang.   The progress shown in Tuesday's agreement is importantbecause it helps push forward the sweeping&quot;confidence-building&quot; measures the two Koreas agreed to in anearlier pact. Those measures, which could lead to greatereconomic and social contacts with isolated North Korea, wereput on a separate track from the nuclear question. Theyinclude connecting severed roads and railways, postal andtelecommunications contacts and contacts between familiesseparated by more than four decades of conflict. South Koreantelevision reported Wednesday that the presidents of the twocountries would hold a summit in March.   South Korea also has strong economic incentives forfurthering economic contacts with North Korea. South Koreanindustry, beset by rising wages and falling competitiveness,looks to North Korea as a place to set up a low-wageindustrial base close to home. Indeed, South Korean PresidentRoh Tae-Woo said in his New Year's speech that, &quot;In the wakeof the Cold War, competition for greater prosperity betweencountries and regions has become quite intense.&quot;   But cash-rich Japan will probably be the main beneficiaryof the eventual opening of North Korea, with 21 millionpeople.   Greater contact between the two Koreas makes North Koreanervous because it may expose its people to outside ideas andbreed discontent as outside contact did in eastern Europe. Itis likely that North Korea will channel investment to areasthat can be contained, as China has done with its economiczones. An area near the border of the Soviet Union and China,along the Tumen River, is often cited as the most likelyinvestment area.   North Korean radio reports this week announced plans tocreate two economic zones on the northeast coast, offeringforeign investors tax incentives. The ports in Rajin andSonbong districts and the nearby Chongjin port will befree-trade ports, the radio reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
