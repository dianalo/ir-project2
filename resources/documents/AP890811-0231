(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posnerhas decided to build five 30-story condominium buildings on hisoceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap.   The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been tryingsince March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state-owned land nearthe Doral Country Club in Miami.   The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land,is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made aperfect setting for a park, state officials said.   But Posner thought the swap would not have been profitable forhim, said his attorney, William J. Roberts.   The Miami land, formerly owned by the Federal AviationAdministration, is worth $8 million, while Posner's land is worth$15 million, state officials said.   Roberts said Posner would proceed with plans to build thecondominiums with 1,500 units on the site. ``We're going full speedahead,'' he said.   But Posner still needs approval from the state because two ofthe five buildings would be built near the ocean.</TEXT></DOC>
