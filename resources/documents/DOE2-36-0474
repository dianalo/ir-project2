With theadvent of UHV and surface analysis techniques it is now possible to studycollision dynamics with well characterized and reproducible solid surfaces.The questions addressed and the approach taken is similar in principleto many experiments in atomic and molecular collision processes whichare the heart of this conference. 30 refs.; 6 figs.
