The program to finda technical solution to the threat of nuclear weapons by creating animpervious defense is fatally flawed by failure to consider responsesavailable to a sophisticated adversary at much lower cost. Responsescould involve: exploiting vulnerabilities; increased firepower; technicalinnovation; and circumvention. Efforts to achieve strategic defense wouldin fact increase risk of nuclear war by stimulating the nuclear armsrace since history demonstrates neither side will allow its deterrentforce to be seriously degraded. Defenses would increase instability intimes of a crisis. Science has also reduced the risk of nuclear war bymaking possible improved control and safety of nuclear forces and predictabilityof US/Soviet relations, verifiability of arms control agreements, andsurvivable strategic systems. Science can be a tool for good or evil;mankind must be its masters not its slaves.</TEXT></DOC>
