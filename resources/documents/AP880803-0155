(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Mayor Hattie M. Shelton decided to stepdown because of health problems, she agreed to stay on until voterscould pick a successor for the $50 a month job.   Three elections _ and three tie votes _ later, she's stillwaiting.   Thomas Ledford and Harold Hartman campaigned in the Aprilelection to head the town of 264 residents. They finished in a tiewith 17 votes apiece.   They tried again in June. The result was 20 votes for Ledfordand 20 for Hartman.   The mayor's race was on the ballot again in the Missouri primaryelection Tuesday. This time: 34 for Hartman, 34 for Ledford.   ``I can hardly believe it. It just doesn't seem possible that itcould happen again like that,'' said Hartman, 56, a supervisor at amanufacturing plant in North Kansas City.   Mrs. Shelton said after Tuesday's vote that she would ask theBoard of Aldermen to wait until the April 1989 election to fill thepost to avoid more money being spent on special elections.   Ledford, 50, a landscaper, said Wednesday he's not sure what heand Hartman can do about breaking the tie next time around.   ``We've been trying to contact as many people as we can. I thinkwe'll have to talk to everybody in town the next time,'' he said.The town has 109 registered voters.   ``We've made the effort and neither of us wants to quit at thispoint. We just keep plugging along,'' Ledford said.   Mosby is about 25 miles northeast of Kansas City.</TEXT></DOC>
