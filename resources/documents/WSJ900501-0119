DuBois Gilliam, a HUD deputy assistant secretary fromApril 1984 until September 1987, told a congressional panelthat &quot;during the time during which I worked with Pierce,&quot; thedepartment operated &quot;basically on political favoritism.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Samuel Pierce headed the department during the entire twoterms of the Reagan administration. One year ago, disclosuresabout widespread corruption, favoritism and mismanagementbegan emerging through official and press reports andcongressional investigations. Mr. Gilliam's statementsyesterday, before the House Government Operationssubcommittee on employment and housing, was the mostrevealing testimony to date and certainly the most damagingto the department and Mr. Pierce.   Mr. Gilliam admitted taking about $100,000 in cash,clothes, food and travel payoffs during his less than threeyears at HUD, because he was corrupted by &quot;just downrightpower and greed.&quot; He is serving an 18-month prison sentencefor accepting payoffs to approve projects in two cases andappeared before the panel with a grant of immunity fromfurther prosecution.   In contrast with Mr. Pierce's reputation as an aloofsecretary who was little involved in the department'soperations, Mr. Gilliam described a secretary who was closelyinformed about, and personally made decisions on,departmental projects -- sometimes conferring directly withthe White House. Mr. Gilliam also said Mr. Pierce insistedthat some be cleared while at least one other was stoppedbecause the secretary didn't like the congressman who wantedit.   Mr. Pierce quashed a San Antonio, Texas, project favoredby Democratic Rep. Henry Gonzalez because, according to Mr.Gilliam, Mr. Pierce never forgave Mr. Gonzalez for callingthe secretary &quot;Stepin Fetchit.&quot;   He said Mr. Pierce specifically ordered funding for aparking garage in Pittsfield, Mass., and a Hampton Universityproject in Virginia before the school's application had evenbeen submitted. Mr. Pierce was on the school's board oftrustees. But Mr. Gilliam added that &quot;from the bottom of myheart,&quot; he doesn't believe that Mr. Pierce &quot;ever received anysort of gratuity or kickback&quot; while at HUD.   But Mr. Gilliam did say Mr. Pierce approved the transferof a HUD career employee who became suspicious about afinancial-commitment letter that Mr. Gilliam knew wasfraudulent as part of a funding package for a HUD-relatedproject. Mr. Gilliam said Mr. Pierce didn't know the letterwas phony. Nevertheless, the secretary allowed Mr. Gilliam totransfer David Sowell from his duties as a senior developmentdirector in the Urban Development Action Grant program,because they feared Mr. Sowell would ask the department'sinspector general to investigate UDAG.   Mr. Sowell was restored to his position in April of lastyear.   Mr. Pierce had four lawyers at the hearing who issued aprepared statement at the conclusion saying Mr. Gilliam's&quot;unfortunate testimony simply represents the subcommittee'slatest attempt to vilify Mr. Pierce in a one-sidedproceeding.&quot; A special prosecutor currently is investigatingsome of Mr. Pierce's activities while HUD secretary.   While Mr. Gilliam's testimony highlighted his personalcorruption, it also pointed to a more widespread system ofpolitical favoritism in the way Washington works. He said itwas widely known that you couldn't get a job in the Reaganadministration unless you worked on its political campaigns.He said his Republican Party work in Nebraska earned him aplace on the administration's &quot;must-hire list.&quot;   &quot;I should have never been hired by HUD,&quot; Mr. Gilliam said.&quot;I got in there because I was political.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
