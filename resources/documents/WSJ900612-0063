This has created opportunities for entrepreneurs who wantto make money commercializing academic research -- and forprofessors who want to make a bundle.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, only a few institutions, such asMassachusetts Institute of Technology and StanfordUniversity, aggressively marketed their research, largely bylicensing the technology to others.   But a federal law four years ago gave universities fargreater rights to profit from the fruits of federally fundedresearch. Since then, universities have been gleefullyestablishing venture-capital pools, technology-developmentcompanies and research groups to make money.   Unlike earlier efforts, the new programs commonly call forthe university to own pieces of the new ventures or to beformally involved in an outside entity that invests in them.Researchers who developed the technology being sold often geta share of the action.   All told, about $750 million, including federal and statefunds, has been made available for such efforts.   &quot;Many universities are recognizing that their researchbase has more commercial value than they realized,&quot; saysAlistair Brett, director of technology management andtransfer at Virginia Polytechnic Institute andamp; StateUniversity, Blacksburg. But the ventures go beyond producingrevenue. Universities &quot;are hoping that commercializationefforts will expand their contact with corporations and alsopromote regional economic development,&quot; he says.   Iowa State University is one such school. With an annualresearch budget of over $110 million and over 2,500 researchprojects, the school figures that it can create a number ofbusinesses that will generate new revenue and new jobs, saysMichael Crow, director of the Institute for Physical Researchand Technology, a group of 10 research centers at theuniversity.   Mr. Crow's organization, in conjunction with abiotechnology program, now keeps track of all Iowa Stateresearch and even helps obtain patents when needed. TheUniversity's Center for Advanced Technology Developmentschecks the potential of a technology.   In the last three years, the center has started 20projects, of which 17 are still operating. One of those isAmes Specialty Metals Co., a company controlled by privateinvestors that plans to make a new alloy to produce permanentmagnets. To test the economic viability of the Iowa Stateresearch, which was funded by the Department of Energy, thecenter built a pilot manufacturing plant for $800,000.   When it was determined that the company could produce on alarger scale, the center helped estimate manufacturing costsand created financial models for a business plan. EdgeTechnologies Inc., a local high-tech investment company,later provided $500,000 and recruited an executive to helpstart a full-fledged operation, which began last December.   The University of Texas is taking a different approach.Four years ago, its Southwestern Medical Center helpedestablish Dallas Biomedical Corp. as a private, for-profitcompany with $12.5 million in equity from SouthwestEnterprise Associates, a Dallas venture capital firm, andDallas investors. Southwestern Medical Center retains a stakein the company.   One of the companies developed by Dallas Biomedical isGeneScreen Inc. It developed a DNA analysis system forpersonal identification and for testing individuals'susceptibility to certain diseases. Dallas Biomedicalinvested in testing to determine whether the system worked.It then raised $3.75 million for a start-up that would marketthe technology. GeneScreen, which currently earns most of itsrevenue from contract work for forensic labs, expects tobreak even this year and produce a profit next year.   Some universities are forming joint projects with otherinstitutions. The University of Chicago has teamed up withArgonne National Laboratory to create Argonne-ChicagoDevelopment Corp., or Arch. The not-for-profit corporationwill develop and market inventions produced by scientists atthe two institutions.   Amid the rush to market inventions, many universitiesworry that commercialism could taint research and lead tofinancial conflicts of interest. To counter such criticism,Johns Hopkins University and the Johns Hopkins Health Systemsestablished an independent technology-development enterprise,Dome Corp., in 1985. Through a business development incubatorand a $5 million seed fund, Dome will select projects withcommercial potential. It then will help sell the technologyor create companies that can market their products.   Dome won't have exclusive rights to the research; it willhave to bid for rights along with other interested parties,says James McComas, president and chief executive officer ofDome. And because the commercialization will be conducted byresearchers employed by Dome, &quot;we should avoid many of thesticky conflict issues some institutions face,&quot; he says.   Because the new university programs are so young, it isunclear whether they will significantly boost universityrevenue or create many viable businesses. But administratorsexpect more universities to attempt the strategy. Says Mr.Brett of Virginia Polytechnic: &quot;All you need is a largeenough research base. You don't have to be an MIT or aStanford.&quot;   ---                    Research Leaders                                                                                                          U.S. univerisities receiving the most U.S. patents in 1989                                                                                                                                                      NO.
