Yet, becausethe economy is in such distress, the panelists expect a closeand interesting contest, with Mr. Bush stumbling across theline in first place over the probable Democratic nominee,Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.   The panelists offer some formulas for judging the year'spolitical events that begin with the New Hampshire primary onFeb. 18. &quot;The problem threshold in New Hampshire is 37%,&quot;says maverick GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips. He means thatwhen an opponent of an incumbent president gets that much ormore of the New Hampshire vote, the incumbent is forced intopulling out of the race or goes on to lose the generalelection. He points to Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, GeraldFord and Jimmy Carter. But none of the panelists is preparedto say that Mr. Bush is necessarily fated to follow in thefootsteps of those victims of the New Hampshire primary.   Democratic strategist Greg Schneiders figures it this way:Multiply the rate of economic growth in this year's thirdquarter by three to get Mr. Bush's winning -- or losing --November margin. If the gross national product growth rate isminus one, he loses by three points. If it's zero, it's adead heat. If it's plus one, he wins by three.   Mr. Bush is off to a terrible start, the panelists agree.First of all, they say, he shouldn't be offering so many &quot;meaculpas&quot; about his record in office. &quot;It's crazy,&quot; says Mr.Phillips. Where President Reagan was the Teflon man, to whomnothing stuck, Mr. Bush &quot;is now the Velcro man. He willabsorb anything that goes wrong.&quot;   It's one thing to acknowledge responsibility &quot;when thedamage is over and the recovery has begun,&quot; says Mr.Schneiders. &quot;But if you do a mea culpa in the middle of aneconomic free fall, I think it can turn out to be adisaster.&quot;   If Ronald Reagan were president today, says Democraticstrategist Alan Baron, he'd be getting less blame for thecollapse of the economy and more residual glory for thesuccessful prosecution of the war in the Gulf.   Mr. Bush's two most recent trips -- 12 days in Asiafollowed by 12 hours in New Hampshire -- were bothunsuccessful, the panelists agree. &quot;I can't understand himtaking the president of General Motors and the presidents ofall these other companies over there,&quot; says Mr. Baron. &quot;Thatwas silly. It takes away his independence.&quot; As for thecampaign trip to New Hampshire, Mr. Baron believes that bygoing there the president helped to make the primary alegitimate race between himself and Mr. Buchanan.   Mr. Bush, the panelists say, is a better president than heis a candidate and hasn't helped himself lately by operatingalmost exclusively in his high-pitched campaign mode. &quot;I'mjust glad that he's not trying to wage a war right now,because it would be a disaster,&quot; says Mr. Schneiders.   &quot;The president is in free fall in the polls,&quot; says Mr.Sears, &quot;and because he doesn't have a personal constituencythere's no bottom to it.&quot; Mr. Sears says, one way or another,he had better hit that bottom fast and start clambering backup to respectability.   Mr. Buchanan poses a special and very dangerous threat,the panelists agree. &quot;He seems to understand that he shouldtailor himself to be a message carrier,&quot; says Mr. Sears.   &quot;It's a free vote for Republicans in New Hampshire,&quot; notesMr. Baron. &quot;Those voters know the difference between primaryvoting and voting for a president.&quot;   Mr. Schneiders argues that &quot;there's a very scary part ofPat Buchanan that pops to the surface from time to time. Youdon't have to be a crazy liberal to get chills every once ina while at the things he says.&quot; But the panelists all agreeit would be a serious miscalculation if the Bush campaignattacked Mr. Buchanan for his right-wing views. &quot;If Buchanandoes well,&quot; says Mr. Baron, &quot;let the press do it.&quot;   But even if Mr. Bush does well and keeps Mr. Buchananbelow 25% of the vote, Mr. Bush doesn't win a famous victory.&quot;I mean, beating a columnist]&quot; says Mr. Schneiders.   The best news for the Republicans, the panelists say, isthat none of the current crop of Democrats seeking thenomination looks very impressive. &quot;If the Democrats had astrong first-tier candidate in the race at this point, Isuspect he would have a good chance of winning&quot; in November,says Mr. Phillips. But at the moment, he says, &quot;I don't think{the Democrats will} make it this time unless one of theseguys gets a lot better or the economy sinks to anotherdegree.&quot;   The strongest of the five major Democratic candidates isGov. Clinton, the panelists agree. They write off formerCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown and they don't see Sen. TomHarkin of Iowa making progress. The alternatives to Mr.Clinton in New Hampshire likely will be Sen. Bob Kerrey ofNebraska or, as a kind of temporary holding-action candidate,former Sen. Paul Tsongas of neighboring Massachusetts.   &quot;My sense is that Clinton will emerge and run a veryrespectable race in which he begins to sort out for theDemocratic Party the divisions that it's in the process ofoutgrowing,&quot; Mr. Phillips says. But Mr. Clinton, or any otherDemocrat, needs to get better and the economy needs to getworse for Mr. Bush to be placed in really serious jeopardy.   &quot;If Clinton wins New Hampshire by five or six points, Ithink he'll be the nominee,&quot; Mr. Sears predicts.   But the other panelists aren't so sure. Mr. Schneiderssees a scenario in which Mr. Clinton stumbles one way oranother or comes under criticism in the press and beginslosing a primary here, a primary there. Maybe, says Mr.Schneiders, a toptier candidate -- possibly Gov. Mario Cuomoof New York -- jumps into the race and all the dynamicschange. The other panelists are skeptical anything like thatmight happen. And yet they agree that this will be a year ofextraordinary volatility.   In the general election, the panelists say, Mr. Bush mightnot be able to win very many points for winning the war inthe Gulf. &quot;Barring a crisis,&quot; says Mr. Schneiders, the war,and foreign policy generally, &quot;won't be major issues.&quot;   But Mr. Phillips thinks that with Saddam Hussein still inpower and with the old Soviet Union breaking into pieces,&quot;there's still a lot of ways&quot; in which foreign policy couldbecome an issue. Mr. Sears thinks it's possible the Democratscould actually take Mr. Bush on over the fact that SaddamHussein is still in power. &quot;The man is still there,&quot; Mr.Sears notes. &quot;At a certain point, rather than just beat up onthe economy, the Democrats would be wise testing Bush'sdiminished credibility in this area.&quot;   Though the Democrats lack a candidate with foreign-policycredentials, they can approach the subject obliquely -- byemphasizing trade, talking about how the U.S. is losing jobsto foreign competitors and complaining that the U.S. is ineconomic decline. &quot;It all feeds together,&quot; says Mr. Phillips.   But there will be only one really big issue: the state ofthe economy. They all agree on that.</TEXT></DOC>
