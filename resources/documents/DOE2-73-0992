Under these conditions,isolated hepatocytes exhibited rates of protein synthesis and levelsof polysomal aggregation equivalent to those observed in vivo and inperfused liver. Deprivation of total amino acids or single, essentialamino acids resulted in a rapid decrease in the rate of protein synthesis,which was readily reversed by readdition of the deficient amino acid(s).The decrease was accompanied by a disaggregation of polysomes and aninhibition of 43S initiation complex formation, which was indicativeof a limitation in the rate of initiation of protein synthesis. Extractsprepared from perfused liver deprived of amino acids were inhibitoryto initiation of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate. The inhibitionin reticulocyte lysate was accompanied by an increase in phosphorylationof the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), suggestingactivation of an eIF-2 alpha kinase or inhibition of a phosphatase inamino acid-deprived hepatocytes. This suggestion was confirmed by prelabelinghepatocytes with {sup 32}Pi before amino acid deprivation. Incorporationof {sup 32}Pi into eIF-2 alpha was two- to threefold higher in lysine-deprivedcells than in hepatocytes incubated in fully supplemented medium. Overall,the results indicated that an increase in eIF-2 alpha phosphorylationwas responsible for the defect in initiation of protein synthesis causedby amino acid deprivation.</TEXT></DOC>
