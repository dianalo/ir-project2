Environmentalist groups allowed to attend part of theclosed-door meeting expressed deep disappointment.   ``We can only conclude that the international community isprepared to condemn the environment to an acid future,'' saidAndrew Kerr, an observer for Greenpeace.   The meeting of experts from 25 nations was sponsored by the U.N.Economic Commission for Europe. Commission spokesman Hans Lassensaid it now was up to the governments to complete the protocol,adding that it was still hoped the protocol could be signed beforethe end of the year.   Lassen said three major areas of disagreement remained,requiring ``political decisions'':   _When would a freeze on emissions take force and from what levelshould they be reduced by a proposed 30 percent.   _Would the United States be entitled to an ``emission credit'' _meaning a reduction by less than 30 percent _ in view of efforts ithas already taken unilaterally to control pollution.   _By what year should unleaded fuel be available in all countriesparties to the protocol.   Acid rain begins with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidepollution from smelters, power plants and vehicle exhaust. Ittravels long distances in the atmosphere and is transformed intosulfuric and nitric acid before falling to the earth in rain orsnow.   It raises the acidity of lakes and rivers, killing off fish, andhas been blamed by some environmentalists for stunting forestgrowth.   Sources close to the meeting said seven countries _ Canada, WestGermany, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands_ called for a freeze on nitrogen oxide emissions at the 1987 levelby 1990.   The United States, Britain, France, Norway, Finland as well asthe Soviet Union and its allies reportedly favored a freeze by 1994at the level of 1987 or later, with a reduction several years later.   Canada strongly opposed the U.S. proposal for a credit clause inthe protocol, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Canada reportedly argued that the concept of using past actions tocontrol air pollution to permit future increases in nationalemissions was contrary to the spirit of the agreement.   Greenpeace has demanded a 75 percent cut in emissions throughoutEurope.   Adam Markham, the observer for the World Wildlife Fund,complained that the draft protocol that was emerging ``virtuallyhas no teeth.'' Markham said it was increasingly likely that agroup of countries, including West Germany, Switzerland andScandinavian countries, will seek a separate accord _ outside theprotocol _ that would call for speedier measures.</TEXT></DOC>
