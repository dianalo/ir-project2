The actual price of the transaction wasn't disclosed.    Southfield Mich.-based Federal-Mogul, which makes parts for the automotive, farm equipment, construction, manufacturing and aerospace industries, will sell its 40% stake in NTN-Bower Corp. to its partner in the venture, NTN Toyo Bearing Co. of Osaka, Japan. NTN Toyo owns the other 60% of NTN-Bower.    When the two companies set up the joint venture in 1985, they agreed that NTN Toyo would buy Federal-Mogul's interest within three years. </TEXT></DOC>
