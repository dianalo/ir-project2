Alan Cranston said Thursday that therehave been two instances in the past in which defense secretariesdecided not to carry out a presidential order because they ``feltthat the president had had a bit too much to drink.''   The California Democrat did not identify the occasions, except tosay they had occurred under different secretaries and differentpresidents.   The Senate Democratic whip made his comments at a breakfastmeeting with reporters in which he discussed John Tower's troublednomination to become defense secretary. A spokesman later saidCranston will oppose the nomination, which is is jeopardy of beingrejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate.   Cranston mentioned the two incidents to reporters, saying theywere indications that the nation cannot afford to have a secretaryof defense who might be under the influence of alcohol and ``unableto make a thoughtful and wise, quick decision on a matter of lifeand death for our country.''   Tower has been buffeted by questions about his drinking habits.   Cranston's office issued a partial transcript of the breakfastsession, and the senator said his information on the two incidentscame from ``what I consider an unimpeachable source that's familiaras anyone is with military matters.''   He said there have been two instances since the position ofdefense secretary was created in which the Pentagon chief decidednot to carry out presidential orders because he ``felt that thepresident had had a bit too much to drink at that time and decidedto wait until the president was sober before seeing if that wasstill what the president wanted to do.''   Cranston was later asked whether the orders were renewed when theunknown president woke up. ``No I do not,'' he said. ``I believe butI do not know that the order was not repeated in wiser moments.''   Cranston said neither of the incidents he was referring toinvolved a widely rumored incident in 1974 when Defense SecretaryJames Schlesinger issued an order to the armed forces not to executeany orders he had not personally approved. Richard Nixon waspresident at the time and in the throes of an impeachment crisisspawned by Watergate.</TEXT></DOC>
