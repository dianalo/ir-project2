If not, then hand meyour gun so I can shoot some holes in Mark D. McLean'sarguments (&quot;Gun Control and Sheep for the Slaughter,&quot;editorial page, Jan. 6). Arming against madmen to reducedeaths by slaughter with firearms would be like eliminatingair travel to reduce transportation deaths. No planescrashing would be a great thing, but it wouldn't put a dentin the total deaths, since more people die one or two at atime in their cars. Most firearm deaths are not occurring inplaces like Luby's Cafeteria.   As for it being &quot;easier {for the government} to impose the`will of the people' upon the people if the people areunarmed,&quot; more people die violent firearm deaths in a year inthe U.S. than died peacefully resisting the will of thegovernments of Eastern Europe. Besides, an armed mass wouldbe no match for a modern, organized military.</LP><TEXT>   And what about arming the populace as the police? I'm notsure the police are so different, on the whole, from the restof us. We've all seen videos recently of what is possibleeven when highly trained people lose their tempers. Whatmight happen with Joe Dokes, who isn't so highly trainedagainst using deadly force, but still thinks (and maybe canprove) that he's &quot;competent&quot;?   I sure don't want to go to a bar where some &quot;competent&quot;guy gets a little mad because I accidentally spill a littlebeer on him. The last time that happened, I only got sluggedin the face. (I feel I showed greater &quot;competence&quot; by notretaliating.) Imagine how it might have gone if he and hisfriends and I and my friends all had guns, as it already iswith some in our cities. Don't tell me that being old enoughto vote automatically prevents you from reacting when you'remad. Bad judgment is all around us.   John S. Milgram   Cleveland Heights, Ohio   ---   Mr. McLean argues that if only one or more of the patronsof Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, had been armed, GeorgeHennard's murderous spree would have been cut short. He drawsfrom this supposition the notion that we would all be saferfrom the criminally violent in our society if &quot;law-abidingcitizens&quot; were permitted to carry concealed weapons. Really?   Naturally, like all gun-control opponents, Mr. McLeanignores the obverse of his reasoning -- that the incidentmight never have occurred at all if Mr. Hennard had beendeprived of the opportunity to arm himself in the firstplace. He also fails to address the fact that many of theperpetrators of these annual slaughters themselves meet thecriteria for legally purchasing firearms including, ofcourse, Mr. Hennard. Much of the lethal gun violence in thiscountry occurs between friends and relatives. Mr. McLean'sprescription would make such violence even more likely.   Rather than citing nebulous homicide statistics fromFlorida, Mr. McLean would do better to conduct a comparativebody count between America and virtually every otherdemocratic industrialized nation, which all strictly curtailthe availability of firearms.   America is awash in guns, legally obtained and otherwise.Has it made the streets or the workplace or the home safer?Are policemen less at risk for having an armed citizenry? Thefacts and the statistics clearly suggest the answer to thesequestions is no.   If a mouthpiece for the National Rifle Association drewthe conclusion Mr. McLean has from the Killeen tragedy, itwould surprise nobody. That it comes from a man withreligious affiliations with the law-enforcement community isastonishing -- and appalling.   Norman J. Barnes   Seattle   ---   Mr. McLean may be a great police chaplain, but he shouldfind some time in his busy schedule to take a few courses inelementary logic. He would find that, even if more people areencouraged to carry guns, the odds are against a spur-of-themoment mass murderer finding a crowd of heavily armedcitizens waiting for him at every fast-food outlet. Mr.McLean would also find that the odds strongly favor a rise inthe murder rate as those frustrated citizens, out of patiencewaiting for mass murderers to appear, use their guns onfamilies and friends in routine Saturday-night disagreements.   While discussing criminal-justice issues with hiscolleagues at his favorite doughnut shop, Mr. McLean mightponder what actually happens in encounters between criminalsand ordinary citizens. In one such encounter, severalteen-age muggers became angry and roughed me up when theyfound I wasn't carrying any money. If I had had a gun, theywould have gotten to it first -- surprise, after all, is thekey element in most assaults -- and I wouldn't be here todayto write nasty letters about the logical errors of policechaplains.
