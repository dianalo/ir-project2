Our proposal invited the submission of written commentspostmarked on or before August 10, 1987.We received 13 comments by this deadline. Nine supported the proposed ruleas published. Three supported the proposed rule but favored an even greatermaximum pen size of 400 or more square feet. One requested that we increasepen size to at least 600 square feet for cattle weighing 1,100 pounds ormore.Insufficient information is available concerning the effect of pens largerthan 226 square feet on cattle weighing less than 1,100 pounds. Therefore,this final rule allows pens of no more than 226 square feet, as proposed,for cattle weighing less than 1,100 pounds. However, the following informationconcerning larger pens for heavier cattle has been supplied by a commenterand verified by the Office of Transportation, U.S. Department of Agriculture.Since 1977, approximately 9,000 cattle, weighing from 1,100 to 1,800 poundseach, have been exported from the United States on two ocean vessels fittedwith pens of approximately 603 square feet. These shipments were authorizedby the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a continuing program ofresearch to develop humane and efficient methods and equipment for shippingcattle by sea. The shipments were monitored by the Office of Transportation,U.S. Department of Agriculture, and personnel from the Department accompaniedthe cattle on some voyages. In addition, a television camera was used torecord the activities of selected cattle during one voyage. Neither thevideo tape nor first-hand observations revealed any problems attributableto pen size. In fact, the larger pens gave the cattle more room to liedown away from the feeding areas. Trip reports indicate no loss of cattleon most voyages and an overall mortality rate of less than one-half of1 percent. This mortality rate is no greater than the average mortalityrate among cattle shipped in pens 226 square feet or smaller. More thanhalf of the losses occurred on one voyage when the ship sailed througha typhoon.This information indicates that cattle weighing 1,100 pounds or more canbe shipped safely and humanely in pens as large as those used in the researchproject. Rounding off 603 square feet to 610 square feet to allow for slightvariations in pen sizes, we are, therefore, increasing the maximum allowablesize of pens for cattle weighing 1,100 pounds or more to 610 square feet.The maximum allowable size of pens for cattle weighing less than 1,100pounds is increased to 226 square feet, as proposed.In addition, we are removing a requirement that space in pens on oceanvessels for cattle weighing 1,000 pounds or more shall be no more than9 feet in width. On ocean vessels with cattle pens of 226 square feet,the width of the pens ranges from 14 to 20 feet; on ocean vessels withpens as large as 603 square feet, the pens are approximately 23 by 26 squarefeet. As stated earlier, cattle shipped in these pens have not sustainedany injury or illness attributable to pen size.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>The Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has determinedthat this rule should be made effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This is necessary to relieve unnecessary restrictions,as soon as possible, affecting the exportation of cattle from the UnitedStates. Most ocean vessels equipped as livestock carriers and availableto call at U.S. ports have pens between 120 and 226 square feet. Theseocean vessels also transport cattle for other major cattle-exporting countries,most of which, including Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and New Zealand,allow pens up to 225 or 226 square feet. We have found no evidence thatpens as large as 226 square feet are detrimental to the well-being to cattleshipped by ocean vessel. Continuing to limit the size of cattle pens onocean vessels to 120 square feet would keep cattle exporters in the UnitedStates at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, cattle weighing 1,100pounds or more have been safely transported as part of an experimentalprogram in pens of over 600 square feet, and the carrier involved has askedto be allowed to continue these shipments without special waiver. Thereappears to be no reason to delay granting this request.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.We do not expect this rule to cause any significant increase in the numberor percentage of cattle exported from the United States by sea. In 1987,130,698 cattle were exported from the United States. Most (61 percent)went to Canada or Mexico and were, therefore, shipped by land. Approximately22 percent were shipped by air, and approximately 17 percent were shippedby sea.Based on current export orders, we estimate that about the same numberof cattle will have been exported from the United States by the end of1988. As in the past, most cattle exported from the United States willbe shipped by land to Canada or Mexico. Our rule will not affect theseshipments. We also expect the distribution of cattle exports between airand sea carriers to remain stable because the two types of carriers arenot usually in direct competition with each other for these shipments.Air transportation is used for relatively small loads of cattle. A Boeing747, for example, can carry a maximum of 200,000 lbs., or 400 lightweight(500-lb.) cattle. By contrast, ocean vessels are used for larger loads,typically between 500 and 1,000 head of cattle weighing up to 1,000 lbs.each. Also, whereas most air shipments can reach destinations anywherein the world within 24 hours, sea voyages may take several weeks.Furthermore, because our rule increases the <T3>maximum</T3> size of cattle pens, no changes to existing vessels are<T3>required.</T3> Pens smaller than 226 square feet may continue to beused for cattle of any size.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
