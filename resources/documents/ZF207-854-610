Onlyif ISDN could offer considerably cheaper tariffs after installation wouldthat initial investment prove worthwhile.andP;  As far as the value-added servicesthat ISDN could provide were concerned, Clark said that the retail sector didhave a potential use for them, in areas such as Electronic Point of Sale, butat the moment users were put of by the flat rate that suppliers wereintending to charge for them.andP;  Value-added services would appear much moreattractive if, instead of being integrated into a total package, users couldadopt them on a &quot;step-by-step&quot; basis, remaining fully in control of cost, andpaying only for what they use.andP;  If Clark for Grand Metropolitan, and BritishSteel's Kaye are representative of the user community, the message for futureISDN network operators is clearly that users are largely unimpressed by therevolutionary aspects claimed for ISDN, and would be more interested if the;whole perspective on ISDN was re-focussed: if ISDN was seen firstly as a wayto improve on, and reduce the cost of, traditional voice communication, andonly after that as a network capable of offering cost-effective businessapplications determined by the user, the technology risk associated with itwould not be as great, and it would stand more chance of attaining thecritical mass operators say is vital to its future success.andP;  - Mark John</TEXT></DOC>
