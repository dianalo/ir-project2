Unit Settles '86 Suit Filed By Bank Board, SEC </HL><SO> </SO><CO> KNDR GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> MIAMI  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Savings andamp; Loan Association of Florida said it settled litigation with federal regulators stemming from the thrift's dealings with E.S.M. Government Securities Inc., which collapsed in 1985 amid massive fraud.    American Savings, a unit of Kinder-Care Inc., said it agreed to have an outside securities lawyer review its news releases and its regulatory filings with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for the next five years. The thrift also agreed to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure rules.    Both the Bank Board and the SEC had sued the thrift in 1986, alleging that American Savings didn't properly disclose $1 billion of high-risk repurchase agreements with E.S.M., which was founded by a member of American Savings' board and had extensive dealings with financier Marvin Warner, who controlled American Savings and was its chairman from March 1984 to January 1985.    American Savings ultimately had a loss of $55.3 million on its E.S.M. investments, although it has recovered about $25 million through legal action against E.S.M.'s outside auditor, among others. Under the settlement, American Savings neither admitted nor denied the regulators' charges.    E.S.M. was closed in March 1985 by a court order obtained by the SEC, which accused it of fraud that intially cost investors $320 million. Several former E.S.M. officers have since been convicted of criminal fraud.    The American Savings case marked the first time the Bank Board had sued over alleged violations of securities laws. As part of the settlement, the Bank Board and the SEC jointly released a 23-page analysis of American Savings' alleged violation of reporting requirements. The Bank Board said the analysis is the first published opinion on what should be included in the &quot;management's discussion and analysis&quot; section of regulatory filings, an area the SEC has been trying to clarify. Although the report isn't very specific, it does conclude that &quot;mere overviews or limited, cursory financial footnote disclosures do not provide shareholders with required perspective . . . .&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
