When PazEstenssoro hands over power in August, he'll be the first electedpresident to finish out his full term in 25 years.   But the social cost of the program has been excruciating,nevertheless, and the benefits so far have not reached many of thejobless or the 2 million peasant farmers who know only ofsubsistence.   Unemployment rose to a staggering 25 percent _ and still remainsabove 20 percent. Without government subsidies, prices for manybasic goods soared to levels similar to those of industrializedcountries, while wages remained at Third World levels. The minimumlegal wage is equivalent to $1.50 a day.   In a wrenching upheaval, thousands of ex-miners were forced toabandon the homes on the windy high plains. Among them were Indianswhose ancestors had lived there for millenia. About 75 percent ofBolivia's people are of Quechua or Aymaya Indian ancestry and abouthalf the population lives in the countryside.   Many moved into the swollen shantytowns on the fringes of La Pazand other major cities. Others descended into the tropical lowlandsand began growing coca, the raw material for cocaine.   Of a national work force of about 3 million, an estimated300,000 make their livelihood in some aspect of the cocaineindustry _ growing, processing or smuggling. The business brings in$200 million to $300 million a year _ equal to about half all legalexport earnings.   Indeed, the drug profits helped cushion the impact of thegovernment belt-tightening policies. Some say the country must nowbe gently weaned from the illicit activity.   ``A complete curtailment of cocaine without viable alternativescould be devastating to the national economy,'' said a Maryknollpriest, Patrick Henry. He works with addicted and abandonedchildren in the city of Cochabamba, the gateway to the country'sprincipal coca-growing area, the Chapare.   The government, as well as all three top presidentialcandidates, oppose forced eradication of coca farms by burning orspraying with herbicides, as is being tried in other South Americancountries.   Instead they favor a U.S.-financed plan, now in its third year,to persuade coca farmers to switch to other crops and to leave thenow-overpopulated Chapare.   But they also contend that the United States and other wealthycocaine-importing countries must put up more money for the program_ some $300 million to $500 million over a three-year period.   ``The big problem is getting the developed world to cooperate,''said Sanchez de Lozada, the presidential candidate of PazEstenssoro's conservative Revolutionary Nationalist Movement.``They seem to prefer to have somebody they can blame the drugproblem on rather than finding a solution.''   ``If you give us the resources, we have the will,'' he added ina conversation with foreign reporters.   The United States spends about $55 million a year on druginterdiction and crop-switching programs in Bolivia. It providesmore than $100 million a year in aid to Bolivia.   In all, foreign aid from the industrialized world andinternational lending agencies is expected to total $365 million inloans and donations this year. Government officials recognize thatthe assistance is vital to health programs and development projectsaimed at bettering life in South America's poorest country.   Authorities agree that the country's most desperate need is moreand better-paying jobs. They expect that to result from theeconomic growth the country now is enjoying but acknowledge thatthe process is a gradual one.   Among the new private investors are several foreign mining andpetroluem companies. But the country sees a need to reduce itsheavy reliance on mineral production by promoting non-traditionalexports such as soya, lumber, fruit, flowers and alpaca wool.   In 1992, a natural gas sales contract with Argentina thatprovides more than half of the country's export earnings willexpire. Bolivia has begun negotiating with another neighbor,Brazil, to sell them gas but the arrangements will take severalmore years.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 28</NOTE></DOC>
