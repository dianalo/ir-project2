As an upstart operator of a supermarket chain in the Osakaarea, Mr. Nakauchi rattled an esteemed department store,thumbed his nose at a powerful manufacturer and generallydefied Japanese retailing tradition.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the 68-year-old Mr. Nakauchi is head of Japan'slargest supermarket chain, Daiei Inc., and recently became atop official in Keidanren, Japan's most prestigious businessfederation. But he's still getting his uniform dirty.   The latest episode in Mr. Nakauchi's unconventional careerinvolves a complicated business arrangement with real estatetycoon Shigeru Kobayashi. Mr. Nakauchi purportedly isoffering to help Mr. Kobayashi's cash-strapped Shuwa Corp. bybuying some of the retailing shares Shuwa accumulated inrecent years.   But to many observers, it looks as though Mr. Nakauchi'sultimate motive is a hostile takeover of another supermarketcompany -- a tactic that still borders on the taboo here.This month, he acknowledged that he would be interested inlaunching a takeover bid for Chujitsuya Co., a midsized Tokyosupermarket chain in which Shuwa has a 33.9% stake. But Mr.Nakauchi insisted he only wants to do so on a friendly basis.   Because Chujitsuya's president, Yoshitomo Takagi, hasrepeatedly said the company wishes to remain independent, afriendly acquisition would appear difficult. But Mr.Nakauchi, noting that Mr. Takagi is hospitalized, pointedlyremarked that Chujitsuya may soon decide to appoint someoneelse to his job.   A Chujitsuya spokesman insisted there are no plans toreplace Mr. Takagi, who also happens to be a majorstockholder.   Mr. Nakauchi's unusual approach matches his unusualcareer.   He shook Japan's stodgy retailing industry in the 1960sand 1970s with an expansion drive that resulted in thelargest retail network in the nation. To persuade theold-line Takashimaya Co. department-store chain to help himlaunch his own department stores, he took an unwelcomed 10%stake in the company.   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the huge Osaka-basedelectronics concern, stopped supplying Daiei stores in the1960s after Mr. Nakauchi rebuffed Matsushita's request toscale back Daiei's discounts of Matsushita products.   As his company grew, Mr. Nakauchi bragged of importinginexpensive foreign goods and bypassing the traditionalcostly layers of wholesalers. He debunked the notion thatJapanese consumers prefer expensive Japanese products tolower-priced foreign goods of sound quality.   By 1989, magazines were estimating Mr. Nakauchi's personalwealth at close to $1 billion, though subsequent declines instock prices have probably trimmed that total. For the yearended Feb. 28, 1990, Daiei had pretax profit of 25.6 billionyen ($187.2 million) on sales of 1.78 trillion yen.   Mr. Nakauchi, who wasn't available to be interviewed, inDecember reached the pinnacle of the Japanese businessestablishment, becoming the first retailing executive to bemade a vice chairman of the Keidanren, or Federation ofEconomic Organizations. Just a few years ago, Mr. Nakauchigot into a war of words with a former steel industryexecutive who then headed Keidanren.   The powerful industrialist, Yoshihiro Inayama, suggestedthat capital spending by service-oriented industries such assupermarkets wasn't good for Japan. Mr. Nakauchi, in anewspaper column, wrote: &quot;In the bottom of Mr. Inayama'sheart, there still seems to be a feeling that to producesomething is good for the country but to consume it isimmoral.&quot;   But even Mr. Nakauchi's ambitions apparently have limits:When approached last summer by an investment bank looking topeddle a minority stake in the embattled New York Yankees,Mr. Nakauchi turned down the offer, his spokesman says.</TEXT></DOC>
