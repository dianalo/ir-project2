And that's not too unusual, forecaster Mike Franjevic said. Henoted a recent day when the high temperature in Phoenix was in the50s and the low was in the 60s.   Highs and lows are keyed to clock time as well as the weather, heexplained.   The high for a day is the highest temperature reached frommidnight to midnight. The high from midnight Sunday to midnightMonday was 4 in Canyon de Chelly, he said, noting that the previouslow was minus 5. Then after midnight, Tuesday morning, the low up tothe end of the first reporting period, 8 a.m., was 11.   It happened because clouds moved in and there were some snowflurries, reducing heat loss through radiation and the cloudsperhaps even reflecting some back, allowing the temperature rise,Franjevic said.</TEXT></DOC>
