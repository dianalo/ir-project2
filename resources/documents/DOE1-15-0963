<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0963 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have obtained an analytical solution of MAneuverable Reentry Vehicle(MARV) trajectory equations that provides useful estimates of a MARV'spotential impact footprint on the ground. We concentrate on quick footprintestimation, as required for battle management of a terminal strategicdefense system, but we also present other applications such as evaluatingtradeoffs between MARV trajectories, design capabilities, and resultingfootprints. We estimate the footprint by analytically solving three typesof maximal maneuvering trajectories in which the MARV combines maximalturns, lifts or dives through specified angles, finally attempting toextend level flight as long as possible. We display several quantitativeresults, for a range of MARV capabilities, including variation of footprintarea with trajectory incidence angle, altitude, and lift capability.We find that footprint area decreases rapidly as altitude decreases dueto the exponentially increasing atmospheric drag. Further, the eccentricityof the footprints depends sensitively on the altitude, incidence angleand velocity, ranging from 0.1 to 0.8. Footprint area increases as liftcapability of the MARV increases, roughly as the 3/2 power of lift fora trajectory with incidence angle of 20 degrees. 2 refs., 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
