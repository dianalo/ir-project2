Wallace Giffen, the engineer in charge of fuel buying atOhio State University's huge campus here, would seem an idealcustomer. He's struggling to comply with an EnvironmentalProtection Agency citation against his coal-fired,sulfur-spewing main boiler. His backup is imported oil.</LP><TEXT>   But in a microcosm of the U.S. energy market, Mr. Giffenis sharply cutting back on natural gas -- the kind of movethat dismays the increasingly desperate gas producers holdingrecord inventories. Gas deliveries just aren't reliable, hesays. &quot;One fellow I bought gas from failed to deliver inDecember. He said I'd get twice as much in January,&quot; he says.   Similar complaints are all too common. Vendors' promisesmay vaporize because they mismanage delivery of gas throughthe national maze of pipeline owners, or abandon lower-payingcustomers if they get higher prices from others. Some simplylack capital or credit -- in an industry starved for both --to buy their gas.   Such image woes bedevil door-to-door vendors such as Ms.Mulrooney, of Access Energy Corp. In her crisp white suit,she hawks to customers with long memories of failed promises.&quot;Natural gas is, no doubt, the fuel of the future,&quot; she says.&quot;But some days you may wonder if it always will be.&quot;   The 1990s were supposed to bring a golden era for the gasindustry. Repeated threats of oil shortages, ever-tougherpollution laws and federal tax credits refunding up to 70% ofexploration costs seemed to guarantee that gas would becomethe dominant fossil fuel. &quot;Clean-burning domestic natural gasis the core of our federal energy policy, which translatesroughly into the cheer `Go-Gas-Go,'&quot; says Daniel Yergin, anenergy consultant who wrote &quot;The Prize,&quot; a best-seller on theoil industry.   Yet natural gas is shunned by many manufacturers,utilities and homeowners. The industry's share of the $240billion energy market slipped to 24% last year from 33% in1970. Meanwhile, high-polluting coal bit off natural-gasbusiness in big chunks, and imported oil held its own.Natural-gas prices have tumbled 58% since 1985 to the lowestin 10 years, and producers, awash in red ink, have closeddown as many as one-third of the nation's wells from time totime this summer.   The latest casualty is Columbia Gas System Inc., whosefailure to anticipate falling gas prices led to its filingunder Chapter 11 in bankruptcy court Wednesday. Like someother gas-transmission concerns, Columbia has become lockedinto long-term contracts requiring it to pay suppliers fixedrates that have turned out to be much higher than currentmarket prices. Companies with such contracts are losingindustrial customers that buy gas cheaper on the spot market.Columbia sought protection from creditors after it couldn'trenew a $1.25 billion credit line.   Why such a resounding no-sale for the fuel of the future?   For one thing, gas has always been a tough sell, withoutmuch product personality except as the culprit in occasionalfurnace explosions. &quot;We're about the lowest-interest subjectthere is,&quot; says Dick Eyman of J. Walter Thompson Co., who hasbeen restyling the industry's blue-flame ad logo.   The poor image of natural gas as an unsteady fuel datesall the way back to its accidental discovery in 1859:Entrepreneurs drilling for salt near Pittsburgh hit a gasdeposit that then burned down their salt-processing plant.Moreover, no John D. Rockefeller emerged in natural gas tovertically integrate production, distribution and marketing,although a few companies are belatedly building suchbusinesses. Most of the roughly 5,000 producers still sellthrough 45 independent pipeline companies that connect theirtwo-million-mile network with 1,443 local utilities in aprecarious patchwork.   Unlike &quot;Big Oil,&quot; the natural-gas industry didn't developan alluring culture or the accompanying political savvy,leadership network and marketing adroitness. No nationalbrands emerged; no natural gas &quot;Tiger in Your Tank&quot; chargedforward to seize the public's imagination.   And no defining technology emerged to give natural gas anexclusive, high-visibility market, as the combustion enginedid for oil. Even with Mr. Rockefeller's ruthless acumen atwork, oil sold in parts of the U.S. for two cents a barrel --cheaper than water -- in 1892. Oil's success wasn't assureduntil 1912, when the U.S. had produced one millionautomobiles. By the most optimistic estimates, cars poweredby natural gas will multiply from a mere 30,000 today to amillion by the year 2000. But now, a million vehicles areless than 1% of the U.S. total -- and there's alreadygasoline for them.   Many industrial customers complain they can't afford tanksfor storing natural gas, and they don't like being sodependent on a fuel with a spotty record for being there whenthey turn on the valve. Besides, coal suppliers, benefitingfrom ready reserves, happily sign the long-term contractsthat gas companies avoid for fear of sudden shortages andprice swings.   For too long, many prospective industrial users think, thetypical natural-gas vendor's sales line has been: We havelots of gas but not a glut. It's cheap but not for long. Mycompetitors won't deliver on time, but I will.   &quot;Customers wonder: Are these people goofballs, and do Ireally want to sign a contract with them?&quot; says Doug MacLean,Eastern U.S. sales manager for Chevron Corp. &quot;We havedestroyed our credibility in this industry.&quot;   Additional bad memories stem from the Southwest's &quot;Let 'emFreeze in the Dark&quot; bumper stickers when much of the Northwas suffering through the regulation-caused natural-gasshortages of 1977. (The regulations curbed the price of gassold across state lines, so not enough gas crossed them.)Since then, many businesses and schools have switched back tocoal and kept gas boilers mostly as backups. Currently, thatantagonism lingers on between the energy industry andenvironmentalists. &quot; `Let 'em freeze' is a valid sentimentfor those who favor environmental laws against drilling offtheir pristine shores,&quot; says Tom Austin, Chevron's Westernsales manager.   Trying to create a better image, gas drillers, pipelinecompanies and utilities are bolstering sales staffs, testingnew ads and printing comic-book propaganda to woo kids asfuture customers. They are doling out everything from compactdisks to pink sunglasses. Chevron salesmen offer packs ofplaying cards. New ads from J. Walter Thompson's Mr. Eyemantry to improve gas's image with mock personal ads. One reads:&quot;Sentimental Stevedore. I'm romantic and vulnerable . . . .&quot;   The industry's image-makers also haven't successfullyexploited the health virtues of natural gas, which emits 97%less carbon monoxide than burning gasoline and nearly 100%less sulfur dioxide than coal. One-third of well-educatedconsumers aren't aware that natural gas is less polluting, arecent industry survey found. &quot;If people realize natural gasis important to their health, demand will go up,&quot; says DavidGardiner, legislative director for the Sierra Club.   Failure to develop a more user-friendly image partlyexplains why natural gas lost out to electricity in the hugekitchen-range market, even though many gourmet cooks prefergas. Sales of gas ranges have slumped 29% since 1950, to 2.2million last year, while electric-range sales have surged 63%to three million. In addition, the 43-to-1 lead of gasfurnaces over electric models eroded to 2.5 to 1.   The electric industry promoted itself with Reddy Kilowatt.The cartoon character with a lightbulb head and a smilepowered the &quot;all electric&quot; kitchen promotions of the 1950sthat overtook the gas range, froze out the gas refrigeratorand gave electricity a boost in home heating.   In contrast, the blue-flame logo long symbolizing naturalgas is downright scary, some gas officials say. &quot;I don't liketo be reminded of a connection between fire and gas,&quot; says anexecutive at Arkla Inc., a producer based in Shreveport, La.He recalls that his own grandmother burned to death in a gaskitchen fire.   The safety image of natural gas suffers even though itsrisk for injury or death in homes about matches that forelectricity. &quot;The fear of gas is far more dramatic than thatof electricity because the occasional explosions are sospectacular,&quot; says Richard McNally, a Harvard psychologistwho studies anxiety.   Some potential buyers of gas appliances are put off byregional gaps in gas lines that may render such equipmentuseless if they relocate. Many areas of the Northeast,Northwest and Southeast still lack gas hookups. &quot;I can'trecommend the Maytag gas clothes dryer, even though it's thebest one in the store,&quot; says Stephen Barnes, manager of anAABC Appliance Store in Houston, the center of the nation'sgas business. Unlike gas, he adds, &quot;Electricity iseverywhere.&quot;   The current glut of natural gas -- which even now isburned off as waste in much of the Mideast -- has its originsin, paradoxically, shortages. The oil-price shocks of thelate 1970s and convoluted federal gas regulations created, ineffect, natural-gas shortages in nonproducing states. In1977's record cold, businesses and schools closed in 22states for lack of gas heat. Congress reacted by liftingfederal price controls and awarding tax incentives forfinding gas. Amid predictions that prices would rise to $12per 1,000 cubic feet (roughly 10 times the level now), manyproducers borrowed money for new equipment in a furious rushto drill.   Prices did rise temporarily in the early 1980s, promptingmany businesses and utilities to use more coal and nudginghomeowners toward electricity. But that loss of gas customersand the new supplies coming on stream soon created a gassurplus so overwhelming that Amoco Corp. alone, with its 17trillion cubic feet of natural gas, has enough to supply theentire U.S. for nearly a year.   Meanwhile, Exxon Corp. is readying what may be the largestgas field in history -- 45 trillion cubic feet -- inIndonesia. Who will buy it all? Exxon officials aren't sure,but they're testing a way to convert natural gas into thatbad-for-you but ever-popular hydrocarbon, gasoline.   All this frustrates Access Energy Corp.'s Ms. Mulrooney, a27-year-old who began her selling career with the tough jobof peddling auto parts to retailers in Detroit's inner cityand has been in natural gas for 18 months. She still has atough job. Many customers, like Ohio State's Mr. Giffen, arereducing gas purchases in favor of a portfolio of fuels thatwon't leave them dependent on any one source. She reminds himof federal regulators' criticism of his coal boiler.&quot;Nincompoopery]&quot; he exclaims. He says the boiler, after someadjustments, will pass inspection.   On her next sales call, Ms. Mulrooney encounters theconundrum of selling at a profit despite the gas glut. &quot;I'mvery happy with what I'm paying one of your competitors,&quot;says Steven Teets, an engineer at American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s equipment plant in Columbus. But she promiseseven cheaper gas.   &quot;You might as well give it to me,&quot; he says with a laugh.Ms. Mulrooney isn't amused. She is already selling on profitmargins as low as 0.1 cent per 1,000 cubic feet, comparedwith $1 markups in 1985.   Calling on Earl Burgess, fuel buyer for the ColumbusDispatch, Ms. Mulrooney listens to him dream aloud ofbuilding windmills to generate electric power.   &quot;Windmills?&quot; she responds in dismay.   &quot;It's just an idea that interests me,&quot; he says, gazing outhis window at the field where windmills could whirl.   Windmills, Ms. Mulrooney later concedes, &quot;do have a niceimage.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
