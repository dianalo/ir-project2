It sounded like an international conspiracy to me, but then I happened to start reading a heavy Peruvian novel written in cinematic jump cuts by a certain Mario Vargas Llosa -- &quot;Conversation in the Cathedral.&quot; It made me a believer. I tore through the rest of his novels, never finding quite the same depth or flavor, but then Mr. Vargas Llosa is a gifted chameleon able to move from light comedy to dark fantasy to politics and history and up to the high ground of literary theory (he used to live in France). He also turns out to be an effective democrat in Latin America, a cogent journalist and an articulate soccer fan.    Having succeeded at almost everything a writer can, without degenerating into flatulence or self-repetition, Mr. Vargas Llosa has now turned his talents to the detective form. He jumps write in with the title &quot;Who Killed Palomino Molero?&quot; (Farrar, Straus andamp; Giroux, 151 pages, $14.95). Next comes the body, mutilated, hung on a tree, covered with flies.    Young Molero was a recruit at a nearby air base, a good guitarist, and very unlucky in love. Whodunit is the question, and two police detectives spend the book trying to answer it: Lt. Silva and his naive sidekick, Officer Lituma. They are not glamorous or masterful, but they get the job done in their sweaty way, gumshoeing around the air base and scruffy towns nearby in Peru's northern desert.    They go here. They go there. And before long they have solved the crime, they think, despite the very suspicious opposition of the base commander, whose daughter was, it appears, the lover of poor Molero.    By any account, this is a minor work. It is not much as a murder mystery. The bloody twist at the end will strike most aficionados of detective fiction as predictable and at the same time contrived. And they will be particularly frustrated because Mr. Vargas Llosa never does put his finger firmly on any one of several suspects. More sophisticated readers may shrug and ask &quot;Who cares who killed Palomino Molero? Isn't it more like life not to know whether an incestuous father or a jealous lover was the culprit?&quot;    Perhaps, but this little provincial sketch would also be more like life and far more readable if Alfred Mac Adam's translation did not sound like one.    &quot;Palomino Molero&quot; is one of Mr. Vargas Llosa's slangier efforts, full of gamy dialogue rich in the tough talk of Peruvian low-life. In the original Spanish, it begins and ends with the word &quot;Jijunagrandisimas.&quot; Mr. Mac Adam settles for &quot;Sons of bitches.&quot; Inquiries made about the original 16-letter superlative at the Peruvian Mission to the United Nations indicate that he couldn't have done much better, but the English is still only a pale and awkward echo of Mr. Vargas Llosa's big bad word.    Mr. Mac Adam had a problem, an insoluble problem. Unfortunately, reviewers are rapping him for clumsiness without noting (and probably without knowing) what he was up against. Mr. Vargas Llosa's global stature has made some people miss his rooted Peruvian qualities. Almost everything he has written is set in Peru and vibrates with the country's many-sided class, race and ethnic conflicts. Peruvian politics pervades &quot;Conversation in the Cathedral&quot; and &quot;The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta.&quot;    Mr. Vargas Llosa's foreign readers learn the names of Lima's neighborhoods and quickly become familiar with their class nuances. But Peruvian readers must surely see these books as the classics of their national literature, an almost systematic exploration of Peru, from the capital to the jungle (&quot;The Green House&quot;) to the mountains (&quot;Mayta&quot;) and now to the boondocks of the parched north.    As always, Mr. Vargas Llosa weaves a locality, with its special sounds and smells, into his nominal story. This is especially true of this slight fable whose interest must, nevertheless, be intense for Peruvian readers who can relish the rough language spoken by drunks in a whorehouse bar near the air base. There is an extravagant music to these insults, but it is as impossible to render in English as it is to let U.S. readers hear the &quot;boleros&quot; that young Molero used to sing to his lover before someone tore him to shreds.    Poor Mr. Mac Adam. What was he supposed to do with gallows humor built on puns about eggs (huevos=eggs=testicles)? More important, what should U.S. readers do?    Certainly, they should take a look at this story, which works in spite of the weird-sounding obscenities based on Spanish words found in no normal dictionary. After a bit, the effect is a little like listening to Monty Python blokes swearing in mock Arthurian dialect. And that has the odd effect of reinforcing the magic spell of this fable from a far-off place by a great writer who insists on not snubbing the place he comes from. </TEXT></DOC>
