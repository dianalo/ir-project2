Computed gamma-ray tomography and neutron diffractionare two possible methods for evaluating the effects of the tougheningprocess. In this study, samples of zirconia pellets toughened with aluminawere prepared and then examined using both techniques. The tougheningwas performed by the infiltration of green zirconia with aluminum nitrate,followed by firing during which alumina was formed. The concentrationand distribution of alumina in sintered zirconia pellets were measured.The results obtained for pellets prepared with different infiltrationtimes are discussed. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
