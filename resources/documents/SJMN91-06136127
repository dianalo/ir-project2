But if FMC succeeds in winningfuture AFAS development and production competitions, the program's total valuecould reach $4 billion and provide an important source of work to replaceFMC's current dependence on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.;    &quot;We set astrategic goal of being the Army's supplier of self-propelled artillery, andthis is the first step toward that goal,&quot; said Peter F. Scott, AFAS programmanager at FMC, in an interview Tuesday.;    AFAS is intended to replace theM109 howitzer, which has been in production for almost 30 years. The Army saysit needs the longer reach and greater accuracy of AFAS to counter recentartillery improvements by the Soviet Union.;    &quot;We're outnumbered, and we'reoutgunned,&quot; said Kenneth D. Julian of Harsco Corp.'s BMY-Combat SystemsDivision in York, Pa., builder of the M109.;    Because of the U.S. weaknessin artillery, AFAS has strong support from both the Army and Congress -- anunusual alliance in the current atmosphere of defense cutbacks.;    FMC, whichhas about 4,000 employees in San Jose and Santa Clara, is already a victim ofthose cutbacks. Orders for the Bradley, a $1.5-million hybrid between a tankand an armored personnel carrier, have been cut in the past year, forcinglayoffs at FMC's sprawling production complex along Coleman Avenue next to SanJose International Airport.;    Production is now scheduled to stop altogetherat the end of 1994, although it might be extended for several years if FMC canfind foreign buyers for the Bradley.;    The Army is now considering a newgeneration of combat vehicles that would include a replacement for theBradley, but production isn't likely to start until the turn of the century --leaving FMC with a gap of at least several years with no work in San Jose.;   AFAS won't fill that gap, because production wouldn't start until 2002. Butdiversifying beyond armored personnel carriers into self-propelled artillerycould give FMC a stronger motivation to keep the San Jose plant alive.;   Peter F. Scott, manager of the AFAS program at FMC, said the company hasn'tdecided yet where it would build the AFAS. But, he added, &quot;obviously, we arepredisposed to San Jose.&quot;;    FMC beat two other large defense contractors --General Dynamics and General Motors -- for the preliminary developmentcontract -- giving FMC a significant advantage in winning subsequent AFAScompetitions.;    &quot;Any time a company gets development work, they're going tohave a leg up on getting the production contract,&quot; said Gregory Fetter, adefense analyst with the market research firm Forecast International inNewtown, Conn.;    According to Scott, FMC has worked for about 15 years ondeveloping ideas for self-propelled artillery. Some of the work has been doneby FMC's Naval Systems Division in Fridley, Minn., which builds largeship-board guns.;    FMC is assigning a crew of about 100 to the AFAScontract, splitting the work between 20 employees in San Jose and 80 inFridley.;    AFAS would use technology developed in Fridley for rapid fire ofheavy artillery shells. The AFAS gun is designed for &quot;time on target&quot; fire --shooting off four shells in such rapid succession that all four hit theirtargets simultaneously.; COMPARING BIG GUNS; FMC Corp. is designing aself-propelled artillery gun called AFAS, short for Advanced Field ArtillerySystem. It would replace the U.S. Army's M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzer.Here's how they compare:; ...; FEATURE             M109               AFAS;...; Gun diameter        155 mm            155 mm; Gun range           15miles           30 miles; Firing rate         4 rounds/minute    12rounds/minute; Ammo capacity       30 rounds          60 rounds; Max. speed         34 mph             40 mph; Crew size           5                  3;Weight              30 tons            62.5 tons; Cost per vehicle    $1.5-$2million    $3.5-$4 million; Source: FMC Corp.; Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE LANGBERG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  705  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136127,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
