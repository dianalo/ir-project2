Within 24 hours after the first of the new machines were available, clone makers and their suppliers were dissecting them, and promising compatible versions even though IBM is using some chips of its own design. &quot;It's only a matter of time before those custom chips are emulated,&quot; said John Sullivan, vice president of Leading Edge Hardware Products Inc., a Canton, Mass., clone company.    Meanwhile, the booming clone industry expects its current products, which are designed to mimic the IBM PC, PC XT and PC AT, will continue to sell strongly -- even though IBM is cutting prices on those models to clear stocks off dealer shelves.    A few clone makers may cut prices on some models, but few see sharp cuts. &quot;It looks as if there won't be a major impact on the low-end market,&quot; said Bryan Kerr, vice president, marketing, for Blue Chip Electronics Inc., a Chandler, Ariz., importer that sells $599 Korean-built computers through mass merchandisers. IBM's lowest price on its new computers is $1,695.    For buyers, clone makers will continue to offer the cheapest machines that run today's software. But those who want machines certain to run software designed to tap the power of IBM's new machines will have to buy from IBM, at least in the near future. The full power of those computers won't be unleashed until 1988 when extensions of the operating system are unveiled, making it easy to communicate with IBM's larger computers.    Many clone makers doubt that small businesses and individuals will want those features. But the Fortune 500 companies will -- and that may keep them loyal to Big Blue. Because the operating system software will be designed to work with IBM's new computers, it may misfire when working with clones.    To avoid violating IBM patents, the clones must be slightly different. &quot;Anything written for IBM will have to be put on a clone and run before I'll believe it will happen,&quot; said Danielle D. Barr, a vice president at Bank of New England, Boston. She said, &quot;We're probably more likely to choose IBM because we trust the standard.&quot;    An IBM manager overseeing the operating-system effort, Lee Reiswig, agreed that competitors might be able to clone the new machines, but said it won't be easy. &quot;We think these things aren't simple to do, but they are doable,&quot; he said. Extra-feature software written for IBM's new computers will work on clones only if they are &quot;100% compatible with IBM,&quot; he added.    Another question for clone makers is whether IBM's new line, the Personal System/2, will become an industry standard that they have to emulate, or just a niche product used mostly by IBM's best customers, the nation's biggest companies and organizations.    &quot;It wouldn't make sense for us to make changes in our product now just to match IBM,&quot; said a spokesman for Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. &quot;We're going to watch the market and see what the acceptance of IBM's products is. The more recent IBM announcements have been dismal disappointments,&quot; he added.    Nevertheless, clone makers want the option of making computers compatible with the new IBM design. To do that, most rely on two independent firms, closely held Phoenix Technologies Inc. of Canton, Mass., and Chips andamp; Technologies Inc., Milpitas, Calif. Phoenix makes the hardware chip that acts as a translator between a computer's software operating systems and the various internal parts. Chips andamp; Technologies makes specialized integrated circuits that perform the same way IBM parts do.    Both companies are ready. &quot;Certainly within six months we can do it,&quot; said a spokesman for Phoenix.    A Chips andamp; Technologies spokesman said the company's parts will take a little longer -- six to nine months. Then it will take another three or four months before the clone makers will be able to incorporate those parts into a clone. &quot;We have five of them (new IBM systems) in the lab right now,&quot; he said. &quot;We will tear them down to find every gate.&quot;    He said it would be possible to quickly clone some features of the new IBM computers such as their improved graphics. But he said that might be a mistake because &quot;the system is so tied together that if you clone just graphics, you may find it's obsolete six months later,&quot; when new software is written.    &quot;The good news is there isn't any immediate need&quot; to clone IBM's new line, contended Edward Juge, director of market planning at Tandy Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, one of the largest clone makers. He said the big benefits for users await Microsoft Corp.'s new operating system, which won't be available until early 1988. &quot;If there is going to be a new industry standard, it won't happen overnight,&quot; said John Frank, vice president, marketing, at Zenith Data Systems, a unit of Zenith Electronics Corp.    Clone makers face several other thorny questions when they look at changes IBM made. For example, IBM replaced the standard 5 1/4-inch floppy disk drive with a new 3 1/2-inch drive. Clone makers said that would be easy to copy, but some aren't sure their customers want them to. For retailers and corporate users it would mean keeping stocks of two kinds of drives available for repairs and replacement. And it would make it harder for users to exchange disks of information.    Another problem is with graphics. IBM's new computers set a new graphics standard and the monitors they use for sharp displays are different than any now on the market. &quot;It's not a sure thing that this is going to enamor the user,&quot; said Robert Brown, president of Norcross, Ga.-based Quadram, a maker of graphics boards used in many clones. Quadram is a unit of Intelligent Systems Corp.    Still, if IBM's new computers catch on, clone makers probably will have little choice but to switch to the new disk drives and monitors.    But overall, makers of clones and parts that work inside IBM computers are relieved because IBM didn't lock them out. &quot;The feeling most of us have is we dodged the bullet,&quot; said Gautam Gupta, president of IDEAssociates Inc., a Billerica, Mass., maker of computer parts. </TEXT></DOC>
