The announcement is the company's latest and most aggressive effort to prevent its big-selling drug from being used by pregnant women. If successful, the effort is expected to head off stiff government restriction on the availability of the drug. But while detailed, expensive and unusual, the new effort is still expected to draw criticism from those who want the drug's use sharply curtailed.    Many of the program's details had been proposed by the company earlier this year but some aspects resulted from negotiations with the FDA.    The U.S. unit of Swiss drug and chemical giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. said that, as part of its program, it will pay for contraceptive counseling and pregnancy tests for women of child-bearing age who take Accutane. Moreover, the drug will be sold in limited supplies, in packages of 10 pills containing a warning to users. Packages will also contain two unique graphics: a drawing of a malformed child and an &quot;avoid pregnancy symbol&quot; -- a circle and slanted line superimposed across a silhouette of a pregnant woman.    Carolyn Glynn, a Hoffmann-La Roche vice president, said the program is expected to cost the drug company about $3 million to $5 million, mostly for the cost of the new packaging and the counseling and pregnancy tests. The company also plans to send mailings to every prescribing doctor in the U.S. -- about 500,000 letters -- alerting them to the new warnings. It also will send to many dermatologists a kit containing consent forms to be signed by doctors and patients.    Sales of Accutane in the U.S. total $40 million to $50 million annually.    The program is unique in the marketing of a prescription drug in the U.S. Hoffmann-La Roche proposed the program following an FDA hearing last spring where strong concern was raised by some FDA staffers and birth defect specialists over the continued marketing of Accutane. Despite numerous warnings to doctors, 70 malformed babies have been born to women who took the drug during pregnancy. (During the hearings the number of known birth defects was 62, but since then eight more cases have been reported, all of which occurred prior to the hearing.)    Edward Lammer, a researcher with California's Birth Defect Monitoring Program, said the new program doesn't go far enough. He contends the FDA should have placed limits on the drug's use by requiring that doctors who prescribe the drug get special government approval. Mr. Lammer also said he and others are convinced that &quot;many more than 70 babies have been born with defects&quot; but have gone undetected.    Ms. Glynn said Hoffmann-La Roche is convinced the new program will &quot;restrict&quot; Accutane's use to people who understand the drug's potential danger. A spokeswoman at the FDA said the agency decided against formal restrictions because agency officials were convinced that the company's &quot;voluntary&quot; program would restrict &quot;over-prescribing.&quot;    Accutane is for use against especially severe and disfiguring forms of acne, but many doctors have used it for more common forms of the problem. </TEXT></DOC>
