The program has been written for the TRD inthe ZEUS spectrometer, which separates electrons from hadrons in themomentum range between 1 and 30 GeV/c. Both total charge method and clustercounting method were simulated taking into account various experimentalparameters. In particular, it was found that the cluster counting methodrelies on a quantitative understanding of the background originatingfrom the production of {delta}-electrons by charged particles. The resultsof the Monte Carlo calculations are in agreement with experimental dataobtained with prototypes within a systematic uncertainty of 20%. We appliedour Monte Carlo program to studies in order to find an optimum layoutor the TRD within available space in the ZEUS spectrometer. In this context,the performance of TRD layouts with different geometries and materialshas been evaluated comprehensively. The geometry found by optimizationpromises an improvement on hadron suppression by a factor of about twoor both methods compared with present results from test measurements.Applying algorithms for a detailed analysis of the energy and space distributionsof the clusters in the TRD, hadrons in the momentum range from 1 to 30GeV/c can be suppressed to a level of less than 2%. This method of clusteranalysing improves the suppression of hadrons by a factor of about twocompared to the total charge method.</TEXT></DOC>
