 The first of these is billed as averification and validation tool that offers the developer tighter control ofthe testing process from her PS/2 workstation.andP;  The tool works with IBM'slanguage debug facilities to test coverage measurement and analysis supportfor MVS/XA and MVS/ESA environments.andP;  It supports the following programminglanguages and subsystems: VS Cobol II, TSO-E, CICS/MVS and CICS/ESA, IMS/TM,OS PL/I, TSO-E and IMS/TM.andP;  The Software Analysis Tool also has anSAA-compliant graphical interface that supports interactive browsing, queryand reporting of test coverage information.andP;  Additional facilities provide ananimated display of test execution, replayed on a generated structuralrepresentation of the application.andP;  And, for that all important Japanesemarket (we are after all setting standards here) the Tool supports translatedmenus and messages for the Japanese Kanji syllabary.andP;  Available in July 1990Software Analysis Test  Tool will cost $5,000.andP;  The accompanying prod uct,Workstation Interactive Test Tool (&quot;for those at their WITTs end&quot; - jokecourtesy of  IBM UK), is used for regression testing for  interactiveapplications in the following SAA  environments: MVS/XA and MVS/ESA (TSO-E,CICS/MVS and IMS/TM), VM/SP and VM/XA, OS/400,  OS/2 EE.andP;  It providesfacilities to automatic ally record and re-execute interactive appli cationtest sessions.andP;  An SAA Common User Acc ess interface enables the query anddisplay of  test results and the analysis of test case discrepancies.andP;  Againit supports Kanji as well  as the Teleprocessing Network Simulator test.andO;Available in April 1990 it will cost $2,000.andM;Application Development Project SupportandM;The one new part of the AD/Cycle that is available now are two members ofIBM's Application Development Project Support, ADPS, 1.1 family: ProcessMechanism, ADPS/P, and Application Development Model, ADPS/M.andP;  The ProjectSupport products are intended to help users define the tasks, tools andfunctions needed to perform development work.andP;  They are intended to providethe quality control for the AD/Cycle.andP;  The Process Mechanism is the driverfor the process and contains dialoguesto help the developer through the tasksspecified in an application development model which the Development Modelthen defines in terms of activities and relationships.andP;  The ApplicationDevelopment Project Support supports MVS/ESA in toleration mode.andP;  IBMannounced enhancements to these products which will be available in August1990: usability enhancements across all functions of ADPS; an enhanced CSPTool interface which will exploit CSP 3.2.1 functions for those customerswith TSO/E 2.1 installed and allow definition of DB2 SQL/DS tables and viewsfor those customers with QMF 3.2 installed; the exploitation of XA for MVSand VM.andP;  Another enhancement, applicable to MVS environments only, will bemade available by August 1990.andP;  This enhancement will provide ISPF/PDF SCLMsupport to ADPS/P MVS and ADPS/M MVS.andP;  In addition, users of Personal WorkStation - PS/2 - tools will also be able to adapt an ADPS-provided toolinterface to enable them to access their PS/2 tools from the ADPS hostsession.andP;  This enhancement will be provided without charge as a SmallProgramming Enhancement to all customers of record of ADPS/P MVS or ADPS/MMVS.andP;  Process Mechanism for VM costs a one time charge of $18,450 or amonthly licence of $1,211 for a baby 9370, to a one time $139,650 (monthlylicence of $2,255) for 3090-500S or 600S machines.andP;  Application DevelopmentModel for VM costs a one time charge of $9,000 for the small 9370 or $590monthly licence, rising to $68,110 or $1,100 a month on top-end 3090s.andO;Prices for MVS versions are as follows: Process Mechanism for large 9370scosts a one time $61,500 or $1,661 rising toandM;$139,650  or  $2,255  a  month  on  top-end  3090s.andP;   ApplicationandM;Development Model will cost large 9370 users a one time charge of $30,000 ora monthly licence of $810, while it will set 500S/600S users  back a one timecharge of $68,110 or a monthly licence of $1,100.andM;DB2 2.0 arrives early - and betterandM;In addition to the main AD/Cycle announcements, IBM had some relatedofferings to publicise: Dictionary Model Transformer Version 1 has beendeveloped to help OS/VS DB/DC Data Dictionary users move their data to theRepository Manager.andP;  Featuring online and batch interfaces, extractionsupport for OS/VS DB/DC Data Dictionary Releases 5 and 6, the ability topreview impact of information selected, user exits, and activity logging, itwill be available in July 1990 priced $25,000.andP;  Furthermore, DB2 2.0,announced last October will be available this October, ahead of schedule.andO;IBM claims that this new version of DB2 offers up to five times improvementin CPU time and is up to 10 times faster for high function queries on largedata bases, that it offers up to 11% improvement in the throughput oftransactions, and up to 20% improvement in CPU and elapsed times in batchupdates.andP;  In addition to this improved performance it also offers thefollowing enhancements: the use of multiple indexes per table to process asingle SQL request, improved access via unclustered indexes, more efficientevaluation of column functions, faster subquery processing, improved queryoptimisation for frequently occurring data values, a faster initialisationand termination process, batch update performance enhancements, improvedInsert, Update and Delete performance and improved adherence to SQLstandards.andP;  For a large 9370 the one time charge is $113,400 or $3,210 amonth, rising to $244,850 or 4,530  a  month on a 3090-600S.andP;  For thosebemused by the  whole AD/Cycle  thing and who want advice, IBM UK stressedthat its  St John's Wood, North Harrow and Portsmouth sites are all offeringcustomer support.andP;
