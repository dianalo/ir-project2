The dollar's recovery made a contribution as well, analysts said.    Platinum was the most active precious metal, with the October contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange dropping $14.80 an ounce to $591.10. Silver for September delivery at the Commodity Exchange in New York slipped 32.5 cents an ounce to $7.50, and December gold fell $5.10 an ounce to $462.20.    Stop-loss selling orders accelerated the decline in platinum and triggered selling in silver and gold as well, said Robert Mizrahi, chief gold trader at Mocatta Metals Inc. in New York.    &quot;Inflation is the key element that supports precious metals prices, and that is a diminishing factor,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. Many traders and investors hold gold and other precious metals as hedges against inflation.    Traders have watched oil prices drop substantially since the end of July amid an easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf, Mr. O'Neill said. While the situation is &quot;still volatile,&quot; he said, &quot;as each day passes without a major confrontation with the Iranians or some similar potentially explosive development, the belief is growing that they might not want to create a major crisis.&quot;    In South Africa, &quot;there haven't been any dramatic changes,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;But talks are going on and the idea seems to be taking hold that tensions are easing and that miners will be going back to work.&quot;    Meanwhile, the dollar's recovery &quot;siphoned off money from precious metals into stocks and bonds, which were higher,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York.    &quot;It's a giant see-saw,&quot; Mr. Savaiko said.    &quot;It was the weekly blood-bath,&quot; said Steven Pepper, senior vice president and gold trader at Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;We seem to have one of these every week.&quot;    Earlier in the week, Mr. Pepper said, traders overloaded on precious metals -- primarily because of the dollar's weakness but also because the stock and bond markets took a beating.    &quot;When the dollar rose, they bailed out of precious metals,&quot; he said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Oil futures prices fell the 11th time in the past 13 sessions. Contributing to the weakness in prices was above-quota output by member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- which some analysts have said is starting to create a burdensome supply -- and apparent easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf. OPEC is producing at a rate of about 19 million barrels of oil a day, compared with the cartel's quota of 16.6 million barrels, an analyst said. At first the overproduction had little impact because consuming nations were building supplies as tensions in the Persian Gulf fed fears that the flow of oil from the region might be cut off, the analyst said. Most of that supply buildup has been accomplished, and demand has slowed, he said. As a result, the supply available in the world marketplace is swelling at a rate of about two million to 2.5 million barrels a day. At least one analyst sees a silver lining for the bulls, though. &quot;From a technical standpoint, this market has reached a level that could serve as a springboard for a significant advance,&quot; said Richard Maseri, senior trader and chief executive officer of Private Securities Corp., Miami, an assets manager.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices extended Wednesday afternoon's rally, moving higher throughout yesterday's session amid the weakness in precious metal and oil prices and the dollar's stability. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index futures for September settlement rose 5.2 to 336.7, but shy of the contract's high of 337.7. Stocks themselves also shot up, extending their late Wednesday rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.97 to 2706.79. Treasury bond futures prices, which fell Wednesday, joined yesterday's rally, finishing about two-thirds a point higher at 89 21/32. Stock-index futures ability to move higher, and to ignore potential negatives such as Britain's release of larger-than-expected money supply figures, indicates that the current rally is far from over, said Alan Bush, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in Chicago. Stock-index futures traders said they will watch today's release of July consumer price index figures and revised second-quarter gross national product figures for clues to the market's performance next week.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly and hog futures prices finished higher as the August hog contract at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange expired with a bang. Strong cash prices for hogs lifted the contract its daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound before it closed at 60.75 cents, up 1.48 cents. Pork bellies also made sharp advances, with contracts for delivery in February, March and May all hitting life-of-contract highs. Rising prices for fresh pork bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, also contributed to the day's surge in futures prices. Meanwhile, traders continued to liquidate positions in the August belly contract, which expires at noon Monday in Chicago. At yesterday's close of trading the Chicago Merc raised the required margin, or good faith deposit, for the August contract fivefold, to $15,000 from $3,000. The exchange is seeking to reduce an imbalance between the number of contracts outstanding and deliverable supplies of bellies. As of Wednesday's close, contracts calling for about 40.2 million pounds of bellies were outstanding, with only about seven million pounds available for delivery. </TEXT></DOC>
