I expected to read more about Forth.&quot; Or Pascalor assembler or FORTRAN or whatever.andM;We hem and we haw and finally we plead guilty.andP;  Anybody can pick up a copy ofthe magazine and see that when we run snippets of code, three times out offour it's C code.andP;  It's not unusual for us to publish two or threeconsecutive issues without a line of Pascal or BASIC.andP;  Some people find thisa great disappointment.andP;  Others seem to think it's a capital offense.andM;If the conversation continues, the flames die down a bit and I try to explainwhy we publish more C and C,, code than COBOL or Eiffel.andP;  With yourindulgence (and in hopes of forestalling a few of those angry calls), I'lluse my space this month to hit the high points of that explanation.andM;In last month's Programming on Purpose, P.J.andP;  Plauger divided programmersinto three groups: the reluctant, the determined, and the professional.andP;  Hesuggested that the last group was the audience most likely to read COMPUTERLANGUAGE, and he was right.andP;  Every issue is geared toward the needs ofprofessional software developers.andP;  To the extent that we hit the mark, themagazine should be more interesting to professionals than to dilettantes.andM;Through frequent surveys, subscriber studies, and face-to-face meetings, wehave gathered information that allows us to understand our audience in moredetail.andP;  We know, for instance, that the professionals who read COMPUTERLANGUAGE fall into three groups of roughly equal size: those who work atshrink-wrap software companies, those who develop software in an organizationwhose main business is not software, and those who work as consultants orVARs.andP;  These groups have some overlap, of course.andP;  And over the past year,while the first two categories have remained steady, the percentage ofreaders who say they work as consultants has grown from 33% to 45%.andM;Language use varies according to the type of organization that employs theprogrammer, and this factor influences us when we select code to run in themagazine.andP;  In the shrink-wrap world, C and assembler are dominant.andP;  There areexceptions, but the rule is that software destined for retail sale is writtenin C and assembler.andM;Corporate programmers - the second group - use a variety of languages, with Cand COBOL being the most popular.andP;  Programmers in corporate environmentsoften get to choose whichever language they feel most comfortable using,however, so it's not unusual to find companies that have standardized onModula-2 or FORTRAN.andP;  Some corporate software developers are beginning toexperiment with object-oriented languages like C ++, Actor, and Smalltalk.andO;As near as we can tell, despite the strong interest, few are using theselanguages to develop mission-critical applications.andM;If corporate developers are a heterogeneous reader base, consultants aredownright anarchistic.andP;  Many use C-its power is required for the demandingapplications they sell at premium rates.andP;  Consultants who develop drivers fornewfangled devices and time-critical code for embedded systems are often Cwizards.andM;Consultants who write general business applications have the freedom tochoose less demanding languages.andP;  Development time and maintainability areprime concerns-they have to finish the code today so they can send out aninvoice tomorrow morning.andP;  Pragmatic consultants use Pascal and BASIC andDBASE ...andP;  whatever gets the job done.andP;  I think there's big potential forconsultants to use high-powered object-oriented languages like Actor andSmalltalk because of the rapid, interactive development processes they letyou use.andP;  But few have begun to use them-probably too busy earning a livingto learn how to use objects.andM;Like us, you may see a common thread here: members of all three groups relyon C. According to surveys, 75% to 85% of COMPUTER LANGUAGE readers use Cmore often than any other language.andM;Two other kinds of programmers read COMPUTER LANGUAGE now and then, but insmall numbers and without much explicit editorial attention.andP;  I call themnonprogrammer programmers and hobbyists.andM;Nonprogrammer programmers are people who occasionally write applications fortheir own use.andP;  Scientists and researchers fall into this category-their realjobs are to catalog black holes or count contaminated shellfish, but theybang out the odd FORTRAN program to assist in their computations.andP;  Officeworkers and students are in this group too.andP;  Pascal and BASIC are importantlanguages for nonprogrammer programmers.andM;Pascal and BASIC are the languages of choice for hobbyists too, though manyhave taken the leap and learned C. Based on sales figures from compilervendors, I think this is the largest group, numbering in excess of 1.5million.andP;  (We'll never know for sure, because many of these programmers usethe BASIC interpreter they got with DOS and never buy an add-onproduct-they're invisible to marketing research people.)andM;If nonprogrammer programmers and hobbyists find something to like in COMPUTERLANGUAGE, I'm glad.andP;  But it's an accident.andP;  Every magazine is for somebodyand ours is for professionals.andM;Most complainers are ready to hang up the phone after this much explanation,but I try to keep them on the line.andP;  He I like talking about COMPUTERLANGUAGE.)andM;When people complain that we don't publish enough articles about Pascal orForth programming, I confound them by saying we don't run any articles aboutC programming either.andP;  We publish articles about drawing graphics, writingmultitasking applications, handling errors, and structuring user interfaces.andO;The code-when there is code-merely illustrates and expands upon points madein the text.andP;  Because more of our readers understand C than any otherlanguage, it's usually in C. But that's an arbitrary choice.andM;It's a matter of singular pride to us that COMPUTER LANGUAGE publishes lesssource code than any other programming magazine.andP;  We focus on problems insoftware development and effective approaches to solving them.andP;  Few of theimportant problems are pure coding problems.andP;  The real challenges arealgorithm selection, code structure, the transition from design toimplementation, and performance optimization.andP;  When a technique requiresillustration for clarity, then we publish a few lines of code.andM;If that makes us C bigots, so be it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
