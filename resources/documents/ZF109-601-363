 It removes the 640Kb barrier andother limitations of DOS, giving effortless multi-tasking.andP;  Unix uses virtualmemory: data is swapped between disk and memory by the operating system.andO;With heavy loads, users are only aware that things have slowed down -- noinfuriating messages like &quot;out of memory&quot; appear.andP;  And as memory chips getcheaper, it becomes economical to equip more and more of the machine's hugeconceptual address space (4Gb on a 32-bit system).andM;Scheduling tasks (such as backups, file transfers and database re-clustering)to run when the staff have gone home saves both machine and people time,takes advantage of cheap telecoms rates and means they're less likely to beoverlooked by careless users.andM;But despite the benefits, many Unix users will feel like town dwellers forcedto live in a junble.andP;  Unix has a reputation for ferocity -- namely for beingcomplex, cryptic and desinged for scientists.andM;No friendly panels lead you through housekeeping tasks and save you from yourown errors: one wrong rm command can annihilate half your hard disk.andP;  Thecommand syntax is infamous and the file system is a labyrinth in which filescan be lost for ever.andM;While this is mostly myth, there are real drawbacks.andP;  Unix software, that cansupport dozens of users, is expensive for single users.andP;  Often it doesn'texist for specialist vertical markets or is less sophisticated than PCsoftware.andM;To developments may make you fell better.andP;  First, DOS windowing environmentsincreasingly resemble the X.Window (with Motif or OpenLook) interface likelyto be found on the new Unix machine.andP;  Second, a wide range of tools assistacclimatisation, permitting day trips into the Unix jungle while stillclinging to that safe PC town house.andM;Many users will keep their PC indefinitely, continuing to use familiar DOStools while they master the Unix packages.andP;  They'll retain the personalfamilarity and privacy of the executive PC, yet exploit the power,interconnectivity and control of the Unix system.andP;  This article describes themyriad ways PC users can connect into Unix systems, run DOS applicationsunder Unix and work interchangeably between the two.andM;Terminal emulationandM;The simplest way to retain your investment in PCs is to use them asterminals.andP;  The Unix operating system contains a database of over 700recognised terminal types, and new entries can be added indefinitely.andP;  Manysoftware packages enable PCs to emulate such terminals as the DEC VT100 orVT220, the Wyse 50 or the Tektronix 4014.andP;  These programs permit PC users tolog into the Unix system, via a serial line -- the PC then behaves and istreated as if it's the terminal being emulated.andM;Thus, Unix software expected to address a Tektronix graphics terminal willfunction perfectly when it encounters a PC instead.andP;  This degree ofconnectivity only allows users to access data and programs on the Unixsystem.andP;  However, additional features of the terminal emulator software mayallow users to log Unix output to a disk file or a printer attached to thePC, or to 'upload' data from the PC's disk into a file on the Unix system.andM;Most PC comms software includes VT100 terminal emulation and sometimesothers.andP;  Unix enables system administrators to isolate users from Unixitself, while still permitting use of an application package.andM;The Unix shell script is ideal for producing simple screen menus, invokedautomatically when users log in.andP;  The application package is selected and runwithout users ever seeing a Unix prompt.andM;Networking workstation manufacturer Sun Microsystems developed the brillantNFS (Network File System), widely available on Unix systems, that allows onemachine to access files on another (via Ethernet) as if they were heldlocally.andP;  Its PC-NFS now extends this to PCs.andP;  Commands in the AUTOEXEC.BATfile on a PC can set up an additional drive to represent a directory on theUnix host, containing data files and applications that can be accessed as ifthey were on the PC's own disk.andP;  NFS Version 4.0 even allows the remoteclient to execute a program contained on the server's file system.andM;Other manufacturers have extended the functionality of this type of product.andO;Software is now available that'll allow a Unix system to coexist on what wereformerly PC-only LANs from Novell, 3Com and others.andM;Window terminalsandM;Unix systems were mainly character-based until memory became cheap enough tosupport workstations with bitmapped displays.andP;  Even today, the majority ofUnix users in business confront a character-based screen.andP;  However, many PCusers (like Unix workstation users) have become accustomed to using agraphical, intuitive interface, so converting PCs to character-basedterminals is a retrograde step.andP;  If the PC has enough beef to run MicrosoftWindows, software exists to allow terminal emulations, running applicationson the host system, to co-exist with DOS applications running on the PC's ownprocessor.andM;Clicking an icon on the PC can automatically open a PC window, establish thecommunications link, log on to the host and trigger an application.andP;  As analternative to a serial link between PC and host, these products typicallyfunction over Ethernet, with much faster data transfer between the systems.andM;XPC, from Industry Standard Software (ISS), behaves in just this way.andP;  Bewareof the name: it has no connection with X.Window.andP;  It uses TCP/IP running onEthernet to connect to a single host (simultaneous connection to multiplehosts is under development) or, if your PC has spare serial ports, you couldhave serial connections to multiple hosts.andP;  It requires no special hardware,just enough memory.andP;  Only 250Kb remains after MS-Windows and XPC have beeninstalled, so it can use expanded memory (memory paged in above the 640Kblimit of DOS software) but not extended memory (beyond the 1Mb PC/AT limit).andM;On the host machine too, only software is required, but the Unix kernel mustbe reconstructed.andP;  A single file on the host defines the PC's access to hostprograms and files.andP;  These are displayed on the PC's menu bar.andP;  If PC usersare permitted use of a Unix shell (dangerous, because it may lead to securityviolations), they operate as if sitting at a Unix character terminal but withMS-Windows look and feel.andP;  Also available are:andM;* File transfer to and from the host.andP;  DOS and Unix files have a differentline-end format but the conversion is made automatically.andM;* Copy and paste, via a clipboard, to any other program on the screen thatruns under MS-Windows.andM;* VT 100 and ANSI terminal emulations.andM;The PC always buffers the terminal data to the full screen size, so you canwork with reduced size or iconised windows, yet you can still toggle theseinstantaneously to full size.andP;  Windows can only display ASCII text -- ratherthan graphics -- under this package, but ISS says it's considering aTektronix (graphics) terminal emulator.andP;  XPC costs from 120 pounds for asingle user to 995 pounds for 32 users, which works out at a mere 35 poundsper PC.andM;Graphical applicationsandM;Other products which integrate DOS and Unix in a windowing environmentinclude JSB's Multiview Desktop and PC Connect, from Visionware.andP;  The latteris a more powerful and more expensive program than XPC.andP;  It can displaygraphics, has user-definable icons and can support multiple host connections.andO;There's a runtime package and a development system for writing applicationsthat exploit the entire MS-Windows API (Application Programming Interface)and, for example, can dynamically exchange data with the host.andM;The PC requirement is a hard disk, not less than 512Kb (640Kb isrecommended), DOS 2.0 or later, MS-Windows 286 or 386 version 2.0 or laterand, of course, an MS-Windows-compatible graphics adaptor, monitor and mouse.andM;You can run PC Connect over multiple serial links and over Ethernet TCP/IPnetworks: earlier versions of MS-Windows support two, but 3.0 will support upto four.andP;  The host needs a specially rewritten Unix kernel.andP;  PC Connect candisplay graphical programs written with its development system, but thepackage doesn't include a Tektronix terminal emulator to display 'foreign'graphics applications.andP;  Applications written to exploit DDE (Dynamic DataExchange) dynamically link clients (on the PC) to a source of data from thehost acting as server.andM;A typical arrangement might have a database running on the host, providingdata to a spreadsheet on the PC; VisionWare has produced its own suchproduct: SQL Connect.andP;  The spreadsheet can be automatically updated wheneverdata in the database alter.andP;  Only certain client applications are capable ofusing DDE, but this includes programs such as Excel, which have been writtenspecially for operation under MS-Windows.andM;TerminalsandM;The X.Window System has been adopted by every major Unix manufacturer as atotally hardware-independent method of producing a windowed interface.andP;  I'mnot yet aware of any product that can convert an 8086 PC to run X.andO;VisionWare's XVision converts an AT into an 'X-station' for only 349 pounds atime compared with the 2,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds cost of a dedicated Xterminal.andP;  AT functionality is retained: you can hotkey between ATapplications and X applications and even cut-and-paste between the two.andM;XVision is installed solely on the AT.andP;  No code or hardware has to beinstalled on a host that's already running X11 over a network.andP;  It needs, atminimum, an 80286 processor and a hard disk.andP;  The full 640Kb memory isessential and LIM or EMS 3.2 or 4.0 expanded memory can also be exploited.andO;The DOS version must be 3.0 or later and you need MS-Windows 286 orMS-Windows 386 version 2.0 or later.andM;Not only can other DOS programs run on the same screen at the same time indifferent MS-Windows, but MS-Windows can act as the X.Window manager.andO;XVision can run in either of two different modes.andP;  For the PC disciplethere's 'multiple windows display mode': the entire screen acts as the X rootwindow, with the mouse pointer changed to the familiar X shape.andP;  Every Xclient is displayed with an MS-Windows border and controls.andP;  DOS processeseach run in a separate window, on top of the X root window.andM;Unix professionals, on the other hand, may prefer 'single window displaymode'.andP;  The X root window has MS-Windows functionality and can be resized oreven iconised.andP;  X clients run in plain X.Window, without controls, so theycan't be manipulated unless some alternative window manager (Motif or OpenLook, say) is run on the host machine.andM;Client displays which protrude outside the XVision window are clipped, but Xbuffers the output of client programs, so the clipped area is displayedinstantly if the XVision window is enlarged.andP;  XVision supports X.Windowcolour and includes compiled versions of the standard X11 text fonts.andM;Under X, fonts are part of the display resource (so are stored on the PC, notthe host) and consume quantities of disk space, so the PC installationprocedure allows them to be reduced to a minimum set.andP;  A font compiler isincluded, so software authors can create and compile their own for specialapplications.andM;Virtual PCs and emulatorsandM;The 80386 provides 'virtual 86 mode' facilitating binary compatibility for8086 (PC) and 80286 (AT) code and a mechanism for running multiple 8086 taskswithin the 32-bit operating system.andP;  The processor is likewise supported byan Intel 80387 floating-point processor with eight 80-bit floating-pointregisters which DOS applications can use for 8087 and 80287 code.andM;Packages like VP/ix and Merge 386 run DOS software by translating BIOS (thepart of the PC's operating system that controls input and output) and DOSrequests into a form that Unix can deal with.andP;  Multiple copies ofwell-behaved DOS applications can be run, and there's some provision formulti-user operation.andM;Performance is, however, degraded compared with a pure DOS system (althoughthe faster processor may hide this), and code written for the 80286 won't runat all.andP;  The Sun 386i tackles the differences in the filing systems byautomatically designating the floppy disk as drive A: and the entire Unixstructure as drive C: although users can designate any directory tree as analternative DOS drive.andP;  DOS files, either data or executable, may reside inthe same directory as Unix files, and the disk needn't be partitioned inadvance.andM;Manufacturers of non-Intel CPUs, such as Acorn with its ARM RISC processor,have produced software to emulate the 8086; these packages are essentiallyinterpreters for 8086 assembly code.andP;  They model the 8086 entirely insoftware and have to provide a sensible response to BIOS and DOS interrupts.andM;Any well-behaved DOS program will run under such conditions, but slowly --because emulation of the complete behaviour of a CPU and its operating systemin software is extremely complex.andP;  The brute speed of the new processorsoften hides this, however.andM;Binary portingandM;A different approach to running DOS software under Unix is the XDOS 'binarycompiler', developed by Hunter Systems of California.andP;  This translates theDOS binary code (the executable .EXE file) into a different executable binaryfor the target machine.andP;  A 'key file' for each application contains 'patches'to deal with ill-behaved elements of the original DOS program.andP;  The endproduct is a genuine multi-user Unix program, which has been tailored to theCPU and architecture of the target machine, with the operating systemhandling any file access conflicts.andM;The conversion process is extremely efficient.andP;  For Motorola CPUs, typically1.6 or 1.7 68020 instructions are generated for every 8086 instruction, sothe process runs at around 70 per cent of the speed it would've achieved ifit had been written specifically for the target machine.andP;  Other CPU's canattain even better rates.andM;On powerful Unix platforms, the program may run faster after conversion.andO;Hunter Systems quotes dBase III, converted by XDOS, at running four times asfast on a Sun 3/260 as on a 10MHzAT.andP;  The range of DOS applications for whichkey files exist is small but growing and includes Microsoft Word,WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, dBase III Plus, WordStar Professional and manyothers.andM;This technology offers a painless route for companies which have largebespoke DOS applications and want to migrate to Unix.andP;  Instead of a team ofsystems programmers taking weeks or months to rewrite the package, followedby further months of debugging, the DOS product can be automaticallyconverted in a matter of days.andM;Language translatorsandM;Particularly for vertical markets, huge numbers of commercial andadministrative packages have been written in MS-Basic or QuickBasic.andO;Basic-to-C translators can rapidly convert these into ANSI C source codewhich can be compiled on the target machine and will then run faster than ifthe Basic itself had actually been compiled using Microsoft's QuickBasiccompiler.andM;One benefit is that, in the face of severe shortages of C programmers,software developers can continue to write in Basic yet produce a product withC's prestige, legendary portability and performance.andP;  Piracy problems arealso minimised for translator users.andP;  Because interpreted Basic is its ownsource code, it can be easily copied and altered sufficiently to make proofof piracy extremely difficult.andP;  By converting it to compiled C object code,such practices are effectively impossible.andM;Translators are best suited to character-based software.andP;  They encounterproblems where graphical and other hardware-dependent features occur.andP;  Theseneed the attention of a C programmer, but the work involved will be much lessthan hand recoding throughout.andM;Sector 7, which sells the B-Tran series of translators (among which areversions for BASICA, GW-Basic and other earlier varieties), offers atranslation service.andP;  The company claims it's much used by firms that want tomigrate from DOS to Unix yet cherish some ancient, often home-made,QuickBasic program without which the despatch department can't function andthe entire company would grind to a halt!andM;Clones, disk readers andandM;command translatorsandM;Some recent Unix applications are clones of favourite DOS products.andP;  Fenix isa WordStar-compatible word processor and Q-Calc is a Lotus look-alikespreadsheet.andP;  The relational database Recital operates like dBase III and canhandle data files from dBase, FoxBase and Clipper.andP;  Besides emulating theirDOS counterparts, these products benefit from the enhanced printer andterminal support, and the absence of memory constraints available under Unix.andM;Of course, the ultimate clone is that written by the original author.andP;  Lotushas recorded 1-2-3 to run under Unix on Sun platforms and Word, WordPerfectand Wingz all run under System V (see cover story, issue 142).andP;  We can surelyexpect other DOS software authors to follow.andP;  Disk readers are becoming anessential feature of modern Unix platforms.andP;  They reset the floppy disk driveto read a standard 360Kb, 5-1/4-inch floppy disk and some can handle thevarious high performance floppy disk formats.andM;Floppy disk is still one of the most cost-effective means of file transferbetween DOS and Unix machines.andP;  DOSalike, recently launched in the US but notyet seen here, allows DOS commands to be used on a Unix system.andP;  Useful Unixcommands like find and grep, for which there are no DOS equivalents, haveinvented substitutes.andP;  DOS syntax can be used for shell programming.andP;  MKSToolkit does the reverse: it permits Unix commands and imitates a Unix filesystem on a DOS machine.andM;Window terminologyandM;Avoid confusion between different uses of the word 'window'.andM;MS-Windows means Microsoft Windows which only runs under DOS.andP;  I used Windows3.0 for the purpose of this article.andM;X.Window, X11 or just X means the X.Window System, Version 11, (Release 3 or4): a windowing system from MIT that runs under many operating systems,including Unix and DOS.andP;  Window means a rectangular section of the screen.andM;Don't blame me: blame Microsoft and MIT for unimaginative naming!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
