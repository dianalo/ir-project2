The reason for the analysis and the meaningof the results are discussed in the context of wave energy technology.Worked examples are taken from devices within the 1979 U.K. Wave EnergyProgramme. Different devices within a technology can be ranked in anorder of merit, based on the quantity of primary energy (mainly fossilfuels) input necessary to produce one unit of output energy. An Appendixis attached containing a data base of gross energy requirements of materialsand products which are especially relevant to wave energy.</TEXT></DOC>
