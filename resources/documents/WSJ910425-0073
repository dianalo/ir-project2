Mr. Dahl will also agree to turn over 90% of his stake inDrexel-employee partnerships, which regulators claim wereused in a massive scheme to defraud the thrift industry.While the value of his stake couldn't be determined, 30 ofthe 250 partnerships involved distributed some $2 billion toparticipants in the 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Attorneys familiar with the case described the move as acoup for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as it builds itscivil lawsuit against Mr. Milken. The FDIC is seeking $6billion in damages from Mr. Milken and his co-defendants forallegedly rigging the junk-bond market to defraud thesavings-and-loan industry.   Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, the law firm representing theFDIC, appears to be taking a similar approach to that used byfederal prosecutors in their criminal case against Mr.Milken, turning Mr. Milken's former associates against him bydropping the threat of going after them as co-defendants. Mr.Dahl also cooperated in the criminal case, which ended withMr. Milken's guilty plea to six trading-related felonies lastyear. Mr. Milken has begun serving a 10-year prison sentence.   Attorneys familiar with the case said the FDIC is also insettlement talks with several other co-defendants in theMilken case, including former Drexel Chief ExecutiveFrederick Joseph. Some of these attorneys said the FDIC isclose to reaching a settlement with Mr. Joseph. Bert Rein, anattorney for Mr. Joseph, declined to comment on the status ofthe settlement negotiations but said, &quot;I think all casesshould be settled. . . . I would hope that the FDIC wouldfavor settlement.&quot;   Mr. Dahl was named as a defendant in the FDIC lawsuitagainst Mr. Milken, which was filed in federal court inManhattan in January. The FDIC suit alleges that thedefendants set up a complex web of investments to luresavings and loans into risky junk-bond transactions. The suitclaims that about 250 partnerships owned by Drexel employeeswere used to conceal the scheme.   Steve Andrews, an attorney for Mr. Dahl, confirmed thathis client and the FDIC have reached an agreement, which hecalled &quot;good news&quot; for Mr. Dahl.   Mr. Dahl, who was considered Drexel's top junk-bondsalesman, could provide the FDIC with details of how thejunk-bond transactions involving Sandamp;Ls were made. In itslawsuit against Mr. Milken, the FDIC said Mr. Dahl researchedSandamp;L acquisition targets as part of the alleged scheme. Hecould possibly be called as a witness against Mr. Milken ifthe case goes to trial. An attorney familiar with the casesaid the FDIC wouldn't have agreed to a settlement without&quot;the promise of total cooperation.&quot;   Mr. Milken, who already agreed to pay $600 million infines as part of plea agreement in the criminal case, facesbillions of dollars in civil claims from investors as well asthe FDIC for losses allegedly caused by securities fraud. TheFDIC said in its lawsuit that Mr. Milken received $1 billionin payouts from the partnerships allegedly used in the Sandamp;Lscheme. Even after paying his fine, Mr. Milken remainsextremely wealthy, although his net worth isn't known.   Mark Belnick, an attorney for Mr. Milken, declined tocomment on Mr. Dahl's settlement.   In return for his cooperation, the FDIC will indemnify Mr.Dahl from any other Sandamp;L related claims.   The agreement will also protect Mr. Dahl from investors'class-action suits over the alleged Sandamp;L scheme. Under atentative settlement of the Drexel bankruptcy case, Cravathand plaintiffs' counsel Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp;Lerach will team up to pursue the civil securities-fraudlitigation involving Drexel. The chance to settlesimultaneously with the FDIC and class-action lawyers may betempting to other defendants as well because the sums soughtare so huge and the cases may take a long time to resolve.   Thomas Barr, an attorney at Cravath for the FDIC, declinedto comment on the settlement negotiations. Melvyn Weiss ofMilberg Weiss, couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
