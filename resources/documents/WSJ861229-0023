Mr. Holmes a Court's Christmas Eve bid, equivalent to $8.65 a share, or a total of $1.33 billion, converting the Australian dollar at its current rate, was announced just before the nation's stock market closed for the rest of the week. It has triggered a fresh inquiry by the Trade Practices Commission, which has been scrutinizing the $7.98-a-share, or $1.19 billion, offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. earlier this month.    Mr. Holmes a Court is thought to be more interested in the television assets of Herald andamp; Weekly Times than its newspapers. Before he made the bid, he unsuccessfully approached Mr. Murdoch about buying Herald andamp; Weekly Times's TV stations.    Mr. Holmes a Court's bid, through his Bell Group Ltd. unit's J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd., won't proceed unless the Herald andamp; Weekly Times board recommends it. The board earlier recommended the News Corp. bid, provided a higher offer didn't emerge.    Both bids also are conditional on 90% acceptance. However, Industrial Equity Ltd., a New Zealand-controlled investment concern, agreed to sell its stake of about 12% to News Corp. before Mr. Holmes a Court's bid. But Mr. Holmes a Court has said he might waive the 90% condition if that stake were the only obstacle to his winning the company.    A Herald andamp; Weekly Times spokesman said directors will meet &quot;in due course&quot; for the purposes of making a recommendation, &quot;but such a meeting would be delayed by the difficulty of getting all the directors together during the holiday period.&quot;    The Australian Journalists Association has called for an independent inquiry into the bid for Herald andamp; Weekly Times. The government, however, has signaled its reluctance to intervene in the battle.    Although Mr. Holmes a Court's existing Australian media interests aren't as extensive as Mr. Murdoch's, they pose potential problems under the government's recently proposed restrictions on the holding of broadcast and newspaper interests in the same market. It is likely Mr. Holmes a Court would have to restructure the holdings of Herald andamp; Weekly Times if his bid is successful. </TEXT></DOC>
