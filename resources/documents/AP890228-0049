Dr. Warren Lichliter said he learned from reporters Sunday thatTower had read a portion of the letter in TV interviews.   The letter said an examination after Tower's recent colon surgeryshowed ``no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism.''   Lichliter, who is on the staff of Dallas' Baylor UniversityMedical Center, is not Tower's primary physician. He said heprepared the letter because Dr. R.D. Dignan, who removed a benignlump from Tower's colon in January, was out of town when Tower'sstaff called and he routinely takes calls in Dignan's absence.   Lichliter said he spoke Sunday with Dignan and Dignan ``backs theletter 100 percent.''   Dignan issued a statement earlier this month saying tests``indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might beinvolved with alcohol abuse.''   Calls to both doctors' offices Monday were referred to SteveHabgood, Baylor University Medical Center spokesman.   ``Both have indicated that their previous statements stand asis,'' Habgood said.   Tower, a Republican former senator from Texas, pledged to swearoff alcohol if approved as defense secretary.   Allegations of a drinking problem were among the factors citedwhen the Democrat-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee voted11-9 along party lines Thursday to recommend that the full Senatereject Tower's nomination.</TEXT></DOC>
