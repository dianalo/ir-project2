We have affirmed that interimrule in a document (Docket Number 88-153) published in this issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. We took that action to enable ARS to capitalizeon a singular opportunity to proceed with a swine-importation project expectedto improve the germplasm of breeding animals in the United States. Thisimproved breeding stock should benefit breeders in the private sector.The interim rule allows ARS to import swine from the People's Republicof China through HSTAIC in calendar year 1989, in accordance with proceduresdetermined by the Secretary of Agriculture. The interim rule also statedthat protocols governing the procedures for this importation would be publishedfor comment prior to the importation.This proposed rule publishes the protocol determined by the Secretary ofAgriculture for overseas quarantine of swine from China prior to theirimportation. This proposed rule also published a second protocol describingprocedures required for the swine from the time they leave China untiltheir release from quarantine at HSTAIC.The two protocols concern the origin, handling, isolation, examination,testing, and shipment of the swine, as well as other matters related totheir importation through HSTAIC. Organizations with responsibilities detailedin the protocols include the official veterinary organization of the People'sRepublic of China, USDA, APHIS, and the importer.The protocols would be added to the new paragraph (g) of 9 CFR 92.41 thatwas established by the interim rule of July 25, 1988, and which providesthat ARS may, in calendar year 1989, import swine from the People's Republicof China into the United States through the Harry S Truman Animal ImportCenter in accordance with procedure determined by the Secretary of Agriculture.The protocols are designed to allow importation of swine from China withoutpresenting a significant risk of introducing foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)or other foreign animal diseases into the United States. The purpose andoperation of the protocols' provisions are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Responsibilities</ITAG>The official veterinary organization (OVO) of the People's Republic ofChina (PRC) would be responsible for implementing a pre-shipment quarantineof the swine in China, and for issuing certificates concerning the diseasesthat exist in China and certain other matters. Specifically, the OVO ofthe PRC would certify that the People's Republic of China is free of rinderpestand African swine fever, and that Teschen's disease has never been diagnosedon the premises of origin and there has been no clinical evidence of thatdisease on the premises of origin during the isolation period. The OVOof the PRC would also designate laboratories to perform the tests requiredby the protocol while the swine are in isolation in China. The OVO of thePRC would also certify that the swine were kept in isolation for a minimumof 60 days and that, during that time, the animals remained healthy withno evidence of communicable disease affecting swine and that all testsand conditions as stated in this protocol have been met.USDA would be responsible for sending veterinarians to the premises oforigin of export swine, related isolation premises, testing laboratories,and isolation facilities to cooperate with PRC veterinarians in conductingquarantine procedures. USDA would issue the permits required by 9 CFR Part92 for importation of the swine, and would conduct certain tests requiredfor the swine while in isolation in China (FMD microtiter virus neutralizationtests for types C and Asia FMD and swine vesicular disease (SVD) virusneutralization test) because the test antigen for conducting these testsare not permitted in the PRC, but they are available at the USDA ForeignAnimal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. USDA would provide the PRC with antigensand protocols for the brucellosis card test, a test developed by USDA.USDA would also be responsible for quarantine and testing of the swineat HSTAIC after their arrival in the United States, and for making thefinal determination on whether the swine may be released into the UnitedStates.The OVO of the PRC and USDA would be jointly responsible for making certaindeterminations about the disease status of the swine and their premisesof origin, and for supervising the movement of the swine from the isolationfacility in China to the exporting carrier. The OVO of the PRC would beresponsible for the disinfection of the trucks moving the swine to theexporting carrier, using a 4 percent sodium carbonate solution used inaccordance with applicable label instructions.The ARS would be responsible for all costs involved in the isolation, testing,transportation, and embarkation quarantine of the swine in China, theirtransportation to HSTAIC, and quarantine costs at HSTAIC. The U.S. importerwould also be responsible for the cost of all swine that test positiveto the tuberculosis intradermal test and are necropsied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Premises of Origin</ITAG>USDA and PRC veterinarians would work in cooperation to determine thatthe premises of origin of the swine met certain standards designed to minimizethe possibility that the swine were exposed to disease. The three mostserious swine diseases that may occur in China and that do not occur inthe United States are foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease(SYD), and hog cholera. The protocols propose to require that the premisesof origin must be at the center of an area of 16-km radius that has beenfree of these diseases for three years prior to quarantine of the swine,and that no cases of these diseases occurred on the premises of originor adjacent premises for at least five years previous to quarantine ofthe swine. The protocols would also require that no animal has been introducedinto the herd of origin from farms affected with these diseases for threeyears previous to the quarantine of the swine.Other diseases of concern in China include brucellosis, tuberculosis, andpseudorabies, and the protocols propose to require that there has beenno evidence of these diseases on the premises of origin or adjacent premisesfor one year previous to the quarantine of the swine.To minimize the exposure of swine for export to other animals and othersources of disease, the swine would have to originate on farms which aresolely swine breeding operations and must not have left the farm on whichthey were born and reared, except for movement to the isolation facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Isolation Period in China</ITAG>The protocols propose that the swine be isolated in China for 60 days priorto export, in a facility on premises approved by the OVO of the PRC. Thisperiod would allow continual observation of the swine for signs of diseaseand would eliminate possible contact with other animals that may be capableof spreading disease. This period would also be used to conduct tests fordiseases, discussed below. The facility would be cleaned, and disinfectedusing a 4 percent sodium carbonate solution used in accordance with applicablelabel instructions, prior to the start of the isolation. During the isolationperiod, personnel handling the animals would not have contact with otherdomestic farm livestock (this term does not include pets such as dogs andcats). Raw animal food wastes (garbage) would not be allowed to be fedto the animals in isolation, because feeding of garbage is known to spreadmany animal diseases. Feed and bedding used during the isolation periodand during transport would have to come from areas free from epizooticdiseases, and would have to meet veterinary hygienic requirements establishedby the OVO of the PRC concerning freedom of the materials from contaminationthat could transmit diseases. These provisions would help ensure that theswine are not infected with diseases of concern prior to export. <ITAG tagnum="84">Testing for Disease</ITAG>During their isolation in China, and again during quarantine at HSTAIC,all swine would be tested for seven diseases that are of concern underanimal importation regulations and that may occur in China.\1\<NOTE/> No swine would be accepted for export that have been vaccinatedfor FMD, SVD, or hog cholera, because vaccination for these diseases cancause false positive results in the tests for these diseases. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Technical information on laboratory methods and proceduresfor these tests may be obtained from the Administrator, APHIS, c/o Director,National Veterinary Services Laboratories, P.O. Box 844, Ames, IA 50010.All the tests used are internationally recognized as standard procedures.They are also recognized by the American Association of Veterinary LaboratoryTechnicians (AAVLD), the principal organization in the United States toestablish the validity of laboratory diagnostic procedures for animals.Most of the tests are based on identification of antibodies in the animals'blood serum against the various diseases. Reaction of the serum with thetest materials of various dilutions constitutes a positive reaction, withthe dilution varying according to the disease. For example, reaction ofa 1:4 serum dilution constitutes a positive reaction to the pseudorabiestest, reaction of a 1:16 dilution constitutes a positive reaction to thehog cholera test, and reaction of a 1:40 dilution constitutes a positivereaction to the SVD test. These dilutions are recognized as standard byAAVLD for determining positive reactions to these tests. The type and number of tests to be conducted, in China and at HSTAIC, aredescribed below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,5,5</C> <H1> </H1><H1>No. of tests in China </H1><H1>No. of tests at HSTAIC</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">FMD microtiter virus neutralization (VN) test for types A, O, C, andAsia. <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FMD agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test using virus infection associatedantigen (VIAA) in serum. <D>1 </D><D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brucellosis standard tube test (STT) at less than 30 IU/ml. <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brucellosis card test (antigen and protocol to be supplied by USDA).<D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Swine vesicular disease virus neutralization (VN) test at 1:40 dilution(serums to be tested at FADDL). <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hog cholera fluorescent antibody neutralization (FAN) test at 1:16dilution. <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Japanese B encephalitis hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pseudorabies virus neutralization (VN) test at 1:4 dilution. <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tuberculosis intradermal test using bovine PPD tuberculin (positiveanimals will be necropside and examined for lesions). <D>1 </D><D>2</D></ITAG></ITAG>During their quarantine at HSTAIC, all swine would undergo each test twice,at an interval of 60 days, except for the FMD AGID-VIAA test. The swinewould undergo the FMD AGID-VIAA test three times, at intervals of 21 and60 days after the first application of this test at HSTAIC. The tests at60 days would detect any animals that were infected during isolation inChina or during shipment and had not developed serological responses ina quantity sufficient to be detected at the time of the first tests atHSTAIC. For all the diseases in question, 60 days after infection is sufficienttime for serological responses to develop that can be detected by the tests.The FMD AGID-VIAA test would be administered three times instead of twiceto ensure that a distinction is made between animals that have developedantibodies to FMD without being infected and animals that are actuallyinfected with live FMD virus. The FMD microtiter VN test is a test on animal blood serum to detect antibodyto FMD virus. If FMD virus has been introduced into the swine, its immunesystem will produce antibodies against the disease. When mixed with FMDvirus in the laboratory at a 1:10 or greater dilution, serum with FMD antibodywill neutralize the effects of the FMD virus on test materials, while serumwithout FMD antibody (i.e. from animals that have not been in contact withFMD virus) will not neutralize the effects of the FMD virus on test materials.This test may produce positive results when used on animals that have beenvaccinated against FMD, but are not necessarily infected with FMD. The FMD AGID-VIAA test is the ager gel immunodiffusion test with virusinfection associated antigen. When an animal becomes infected with thefield strain of FMD, the live virus replicates in the animal's body. Theanimal's immune system produces a specific antibody at this time to helpstop the viral replication. The VIAA antigen has been developed to detectthe presence of this antibody; thus, if the test is positive, it showsthat the animal has experienced active FMD infection, rather than antibodyproduction as a result of vaccination against FMD. Animals must test negative to both FMD tests, and be free from clinicalsigns of FMD, or they will be prohibited export.The brucellosis STT test is the standard tube agglutination test. If theanimal is infected with brucellosis organisms, the test demonstrates thepresence of antibodies against brucellosis. The <T3>Brucella </T3>cells in the antigen, when mixed with serum, will beagglutinated, or clumped, by the action of the antibody in the animal'sserum. If the animal is free of brucellosis, no agglutination will occurin the serum sample. The brucellosis card test is a rapid field test for brucellosis that maybe performed on while blood. A positive reaction will cause agglutinationon the special card developed for the test. An obvious advantage is thatthe test results are immediately available at the test site with no needto be sent to a laboratory. This test has been used with special successin testing swine. The SVD VN test is a test of serum to detect antibodies against the SVDvirus. In a positive test result, serum from an animal that has been infectedwith SVD neutralizes the effect of the SVD virus in specific laboratorymaterials.The hog cholera FAN test is the fluorescent antibody neutralization test.It is based on direct microscopic examination. If hog cholera antibodiesare present in serum from swine, it will neutralize the fluorescence causedby the viral antigen in infected tissue. If no antibody is present, thetissue will exhibit fluorescence.The Japanese B encephalitis HI test is a hemagglutination test of serum.If antibody against Japanese B encephalitis is present it neutralizes theability of the viral antigen to cause agglutination in the serum sample.The pseudorabies VN test is a virus neutralization test. It is a plateagglutination test, conducted with antigen particles bonded to latex. Inthe presence of pseudorabies antibodies, agglutination occurs.The tuberculosis intradermal test is done by injecting an antigen calledtuberculin into the skin of the animal to be tested. If antibodies againsttuberculosis are present in the animal, the point of injection will reactwith swelling and redness within 48 hours. This reaction shows that theanimal has been exposed to the tuberculosis organism and is probably infected.Positive animals would be necropsied and examined for TB lesions as conclusiveproof of infection. If no lesions are found, the remaining swine wouldbe eligible for export.In addition, while at HSTAIC the swine would share their pens with contactsentinel animals (pigs and calves that are known to be susceptible to theabove diseases and that are known not to possess antibodies to these diseases).The contact sentinel animals would provide an additional test for infectionof the imported swine, as they would be regularly examined for clinicalsigns of disease and their serum would be tested for antibodies that wouldindicate exposure to diseases carried by the imported swine. Approximately60 days after the contact sentinel animals are placed with the importedswine, the sentinel pigs would be inoculated with blood from the importedswine to ensure exposure to any pathogens present in the swine. Approximately90 days after the contact sentinel animals are placed with the importedswine, serum from the sentinel pigs would be tested for signs of exposureto the seven diseases for which the imported swine were tested.<ITAG tagnum="84">Transportation</ITAG>The protocols contain requirements to ensure that the imported swine wouldnot come in contact during transport with any animals or other materialsthat could infect the swine with disease, and to ensure that the swinecould not infect any other animals with diseases they may carry. All cratesand parts of vehicles, ships, or aircraft used to hold livestock for transportor handling of the swine while in China must be cleaned, and disinfectedprior to use with a 4 percent sodium carbonate solution used in accordancewith applicable label instructions. During movement from the premises oforigin to the isolation facility, and from the isolation facility to HSTAIC,the swine may not have contact with, or exposure to, animals not includedin the group at the isolation facility. Exposure consists of contact withyards, pens, or other facilities or vehicles that have been in contactwith other animals and have not been cleaned and disinfected as describedabove. In China, the swine would be moved under joint supervision by theOVO of the PRC and USDA directly from the isolation facility to the exportingcarrier by trucks or other carriers that have been cleaned, and disinfectedusing a 4 percent sodium carbonate solution used in accordance with applicablelabel instructions, under joint OVO/USDA supervision. The swine would beexamined clinically within 24 hours prior to loading for export by a USDAveterinarian and must be healthy and free of signs of infectious and contagiousdiseases. During movement from China to HSTAIC, if the swine transit countriesaffected with FMD, rinderpest, hog cholera, SVD, or African swine fever,they would be refused entry on arrival at HSTAIC, unless they were accompanieden route by a USDA inspector who certifies that no disease exposure occurredduring shipment. As a safeguard against spreading foreign animal diseasesinto the United States, the swine would not transit through the UnitedStates, or any of its territories, en route to U.S. quarantine, exceptas specifically provided for in an import permit issued by APHIS.The landing of the swine in the United States would be carried out in accordancewith instructions given by a USDA veterinary officer at HSTAIC. All vesselsor aircraft from which the imported swine were landed would be immediatelycleaned, and disinfected using a 4 percent sodium carbonate and 0.1 percentsodium silicate solution used in accordance with applicable label instructions,in the presence of a USDA veterinary officer.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ectoparasites and Precautionary Treatments</ITAG>Swine are subject to infestation with ticks, lice, and mange organismsand other ectoparasites, and to leptospirosis, a communicable disease ofswine, humans, and many other animals. While infestation with ectoparasitiesor leptospirosis does not preclude swine from being imported under theregulations, they are a general health hazard for swine, and the protocolstherefore require examination and treatments for ectoparasites, and a precautionarytreatment for leptospirosis. While in isolation in China, all swine offeredfor exportation would be clinically examined and treated for ectoparasiteswith a pesticide approved by the OVO of the PRC used in accordance withapplicable label instructions, and given an intramuscular injection ofdihydrostreptomycin at a rate of 25 mg/kg dosage twice at an interval of14 days as a precautionary treatment for leptospirosis. This treatmentis an internationally recognized standard procedure for leptospirosis.All imported swine would be examined for ectoparasites on arrival at HSTAICand, if found free of infestation, would receive a precautionary spraywith coumaphos, used in accordance with applicable label instructions,in a wettable powder or 0.06 emulsified concentrate solution spray form.If found to be infested, all affected and exposed swine would be treateduntil found free of infestation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Release or Disposal of the Swine</ITAG>USDA would make the final determination on the eligibility of Chinese swineto be exported to the United States, and their eligibility to be releasedfrom quarantine at HSTAIC into the United States. The swine would be quarantinedat HSTAIC under the supervision of a veterinary officer of USDA for a periodof at least 120 days after arrival and until all tests required by theprotocols have been successfully completed. To qualify for release, ananimal must have negative test results. If any imported or sentinel animalsshowed clinical symptoms of, or the causative organism was isolated for,FMD, rinderpest, SVD, or hog cholera, USDA would cause all imported andsentinel animals to be slaughtered and the carcasses disposed of as prescribedby USDA to prevent the spread of disease. These diseases constitute majorrisks to the health of the U.S. animal industries, and if one animal ina consignment tests positive for one of these diseases the level of riskjustifies destruction and disposal of all animals in the consignment, eventhose that tested negative for the diseases. This provision would guardagainst the slight possibility that animals that tested negative for thesediseases were so recently infected that the tests would be unable to detectthe infection, or that noninfected animals carried viable disease virusesexternally. If any imported or sentinel animals showed clinical symptomsof, or were considered exposed to, any other disease, or were classifiedas positive to any of the tests conducted during the quarantine period,USDA may cause any or all of the animals to be slaughtered and the carcassesdisposed of as prescribed by USDA to prevent the spread of disease.As part of monitoring the imported swine for clinical signs of disease,HSTAIC personnel would take the temperatures of all imported swine dailyfor seven days after arrival and thereafter at the discretion of the quarantineofficers in charge.No animals would be allowed to be moved from HSTAIC until duly dischargedby APHIS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Our proposal would enable ARS to import 144 swine for research on the possibilityof improving the germplasm of breeding swine in the United States. If improvedbreeding stock is developed, it should eventually benefit breeders in theprivate sector.In December 1986, the swine population of the United States was approximately51,000,000, of which approximately 6,612,000 were intended for breedingpurposes. The ARS shipment is very small compared to this population, andis destined for research facilities instead of the normal market channelsin the United States. There are two potential effects resulting from adoption of this proposedrule, one immediate and one long-term. The first impact is the costs involvedin importing the shipment of Chinese swine in accordance with the proposedrule, estimated at $497,000. All costs associated with the importationof the swine would be borne by ARS. The second possible impact is indirect and could occur only after yearsof research and development involving the import swine. This impact wouldbe development of improved breeds of U.S. swine incorporating desirabletraits of the imported Chinese swine. If such development is successful,productivity of U.S. swine could increase, resulting in savings for swineproducers and decreases in domestic consumer prices for pork and pork products.Since over 98 percent of U.S. swine producers qualify as small entities,higher swine productivity would have a beneficial effect on small entities.Higher swine productivity may be achieved only if numerous activities outsidethe scope of this rule occur, such as successful research results, developmentof improved breeds that are marketable, and acceptance and distributionof improved breeds by the marketplace.  Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this proposal contain on information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmetnal consultation with state and local officials. (See 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Period  </ITAG>The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service hasdetermined that this rulemaking proceeding should be expedited by allowinga 15-day comment period on the proposal. The Agricultural Research Serviceand the People's Republic of China have already selected swine to be importedin accordance with this rule, and delay would jeopardize arrangements toimport these swine, which will be used in research to benefit United Statesswine breds. In addition, delay would lengthen the period during whichuse of the HSTAIC facility is devoted exclusively to use by the AgriculturalResearch Service for importation of swine from China. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92</ITAG>Animal diseases, Canada, Imports, Livestock and livestock products, Mexico,Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Transportation, Wildlife.
