The assistance is in the form of rental assistance under thesection 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program. These payments equal therent for the unit, including utilities, minus the portion of the rent payableby the tenant under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. HUD will make the assistanceavailable for 10 years. This program is authorized by section 441 of theStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100-77, approved July22, 1987).This Notice informs the public of the availability of $45 million appropriatedfor the program by the Department of Housing and Urban Development_IndependentAgencies Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-404, approved August 19,1988). HUD estimates that this $45 million will assist approximately 1,200units over the 10-year period. The Notice states the requirements thatwill govern the use of the funds made available in Fiscal Year 1989 foruse under section 441.HUD will fund applications from public housing agencies (PHAs) which bestdemonstrate a need for the assistance and the ability to undertake andcarry out the program. HUD will conduct a national competition to selectPHAs to participate.The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) adopted additional program requirements(as discussed below under <T3>Background</T3>). The new law requires the Department to implementthe requirements by Notice within 60 days of its enactment and by regulationswithin 12 months.

Significant Changes from Fiscal Year 1988 Notice</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">I. Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Legislative Authority and Applicability</ITAG>On July 22, 1987, the President signed into law the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Act (the ``McKinney Act''), Pub. L. 100-77. Title IVof the McKinney Act contains a number of housing assistance provisionsfor HUD to administer. This Notice implements section 441 of the McKinneyAct, which authorizes the section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation AssistanceProgram for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings for Homeless Individuals.The Notice also announces availability of a $45 million appropriation underthe Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies AppropriationsAct, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-404, approved August 19, 1988). A prior Notice ofFunding Availability was published in Fiscal Year 1988 (52 FR 38380, October15, 1987). The requirements of today's Notice only apply to funds madeavailable in Fiscal Year 1989 under section 441. (The Fiscal Year 1988Notice continues in effect for the funds made available in Fiscal Year1988 under section 441).The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L.100-628, approved November 7, 1988) (the ``1988 Amendments'') makes additionalprogram changes regarding (1) the use of efficiency units, (2) a definitionof ``major spaces'', (3) an annual adjustment of the cost limitation perunit, and (4) responsibility for environmental reviews. A discussion ofthese program changes is set forth below under <T3>Summary.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Summary</ITAG>Under the program as originally enacted, HUD will enter into annual contributionscontracts (ACCs) with public housing agencies (PHAs) in connection withthe moderate rehabilitation of residential properties in which some orall of the dwelling units may not contain either food preparation or sanitaryfacilities. Each of thse single room occupancy (SRO) units is intendedfor occupancy by one eligible homeless individual.Selection of tenants is not subject to the 15 and 30 percent limitationson the number of units that may be occupied by ``other single persons''or to the preference for elderly, handicapped, or displaced single personsover other single persons (see section 3(b)(3) of the U.S. Housing Actof 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3), and the waiver of these provisions in sectionVIII.B. of this Notice). If, after appropriate outreach efforts by thePHA and the Owner, there are insufficient eligible homeless individualsto fill all assisted units, the Owner may rent them to eligible non-homelessindividuals.Amounts made available must be allocated by HUD on the basis of a nationalcompetition to the applicants that best demonstrate a need for the assistanceand the ability to undertake and carry out a program to be assisted underthat section. No single city or urban county is eligible to receive morethan 10 percent of the assistance made available.Under this program, HUD will provide assistance for a 10-year assistanceperiod. (In Fiscal Year 1989, 10 percent of assistance made available is$4,500,000 of budget authority, which is equivalent to administrativelycontrolled contract authority of $450,000 for each year over the 10-yearassistance period.) The statutory allocation procedures established forthe program by section 441 apply instead of the ``fair share'' allocationprocedures required for most assisted housing funds by section 213(d) ofthe Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 1439(d).Applications must contain an identification of the particular structuresproposed for rehabilitation. HUD does not require competitive selectionof Owners by PHAs because of the special nature of this program. A PHAwhich is selected will execute an ACC with HUD. The ACC shall be for aterm of eleven years (thus allowing for one year to place the units undera Housing Assistance Payments Contract (HAP Contract) and a 10-year assistanceperiod under the HAP Contract). The ACC will give HUD the option to renewthe ACC for an additional 10 years, subject to the availability of appropriations.Before the Owner begins any rehabilitation, the PHA and the Owner mustenter into an Agreement to Enter into Housing Assistance Payments Contract(Agreement). After completion of rehabilitation, the PHA and the Ownerwill enter into a Housing Assistance Payments Contract. The HAP Contractmust be entered into within 12 months of execution of the ACC and willhave a 10-year term.Under the original program, the total cost of rehabilitation that may becompensated through Contract Rents under a HAP Contract could not exceed$14,000 per SRO unit (including a pro rata share of the cost related tocommon areas). This limit could be adjusted in certain circumstances. (Thereis no limitation on the cost of rehabilitation under the regular program.)Displacement (the permanent, involuntay move of an occupant) will not beallowed under the SRO Program, as further elaborated upon in section II.D.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ PHAs should be aware that any displacement resulting fromthe regular Moderate Rehabilitation Program after April 2, 1989, will besubject to the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Act (URA). The URAwill cover all persons displaced by the rehabilitation project, not justthose in assisted units. In other words, if the rehabilitation of an occupied10-unit structure displaces any family, that family would be covered bythe URA, whether or not the family occupied one of the units to be assisted,and regardless of the family's income. Regulations implementing the URArequirements for the regular Moderate Rehabilitation Program will be issuedbefore April 2, 1989.This Notice incorporates by reference many of the regulations for the currentModerate Rehabilitation Program in 24 CFR Part 882, Subparts D and E, andrefers to other regulations in Title 24. Section references to HUD regulationsare to Title 24. The term ``family'' as used in Title 24 shall be understoodto refer to an individual for purposes of this program.The 1988 Amendments made the following changes to the SRO Program:(1) SRO assistance may now be used in connection with the moderate rehabilitationof efficiency units, if the owner agrees to pay the additional costs ofrehabilitating and operating the units. This amendment is evidenced inthis Notice by permitting, under section II.B. <T3>Housing Quality Standards, </T3>an SRO unit that may contain both foodpreparation and sanitary facilities. However, in no case, may the fairmarket rents for SRO units be exceeded. (That fair market rent is 75 percentof the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation fair market rent.)(2) A definition of ``major spaces'' is provided in connection with fireand safety improvements and is set forth to mean ``hallways, large commonareas, and other areas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes.''This definition is contained in this Notice under section II.B. <T3>Housing Quality Standards.</T3>(3) HUD is required to increase the per unit cost limit each year to takeinto account increases in construction costs, starting with assistanceprovided on or after October 1, 1988. For purposes of Fiscal Year 1989funding, the cost limitation has been raised from $14,000 per unit to $14,300per unit to take into account increases in construction costs during thepast 12-month period. This amendment is made by changes to section III.G<T3>Initial Contract Rents.</T3>(4) Under section 104(g) of the Housing and Community Development Act of1974, 42 U.S.C. 5304 (the ``1974 Act''), funds may be released for particularprojects to recipients of assistance under Title I of the 1974 Act whoassume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking,and actions under the 1974 Act. Section 482(a) of the 1988 Amendments statesthat ``the provisions of, and regulations and procedures applicable under,section 104(g)'' of the 1974 Act shall apply to assistance and projectsunder Title IV of the McKinney Act. This gives HUD the discretion to applythe environmental review procedures of section 104(g) and its implementingregulations at 24 CFR Part 58 to the section 8 SRO program.In all the programs to which section 104(g) (other than those in TitleIV of the McKinney Act) applies, the recipients of assistance are jurisdictionswith general purpose powers. Although a small minority of PHAs are agenciesof general local government, the majority do not possess general purposepowers. The Department believes that the existence of such powers_especiallypowers relating to land use control_is an important element in a recipient'sability to carry out the status of a ``responsible Federal official,''within the meaning of section 104(g). Clearly, most PHAs do not possessthese powers and would be unable to successfully carry out these environmentalresponsibilities.Thus, for purpose of this Notice, the Department will provide for assumptionof environmental review responsibilities by PHAs, but will carry out thesefunctions itself. This decision applies to all PHAs, even if they possessgeneral governmental powers. In the Department's view, the relatively smallnumber of PHAs that have these powers does not justify operating a dualsystem for environmental review for the program.In developing a final rule for this program, the Department specificallyrequests comments on the following alternative proposals for handling environmentalreviews for this program in the future:  (a) HUD to continue to conduct the environmental reviews for all recipientsunder this program, or  (b) Units of general local government that operate as PHAs to assume responsibilityfor conducting their own environmental reviews, with HUD continuing toconduct the reviews for all other PHAs.  (5) The 1988 Amendments require Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plans(CHAPs) to contain an assurance that each grantee, recipient, and projectsponsor (as appropriate) will administer, in good faith, a policy designedto ensure that the homeless facility is free from the illegal use, possession,or distribution of drugs or alcohol by its beneficiaries. SROs under thisprogram are homeless facilities for this purpose and, therefore, subjectto CHAP requirements regarding drug- and alcohol-free facilities as setforth in Section III.4 of the CHAP Notice published on December 28, 1988(53 FR 52600). This requirement is set forth in this Notice under SectionIII.B <T3>Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP)</T3> as paragraph (3). <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Processing Schedule  </ITAG>The first Notice for this program, which was published on October 15, 1987,set extremely short deadlines for the various processing stages under theprogram in an effort to make housing available for the homeless as soonas possible.  Experience has shown that the schedule required by the first Notice wasunrealistic in many cases, especially where specific structures had notbeen identified. Accordingly, this Notice extends the time periods forthe application and rehabilitation processes. However, applicants shouldensure that their applications are prepared expeditiously: the applicationnow requires more detailed information and evidence of commitments thanwere required by the first Notice and the maximum rehabilitation periodis still shorter than that permitted under the regular Moderate Rehabilitationprogram. The Department believes that the application period provided strikesthe appropriate balance between ensuring quality projects and the timelyprovision of assistance to homeless individuals.  II. Project Eligibility and Other Requirements  <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Eligible and Ineligible Properties  </ITAG>(1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph A, housing suitablefor moderate rehabilitation, as defined in andSection; 882.402, is eligiblefor inclusion under this program. Existing structures of various typesmay be appropriate for this program, including single family houses andmultifamily structures.  (2) Housing is <T3>not </T3>eligible for assistance under this program if it:(a) Is, or has been within 12 months before the Owner submits a proposalto the PHA, subsidized under any Federal housing program, including theCertificate or Housing Voucher program;  (b) Is owned either by the PHA administering the ACC under this programor by an entity controlled by that PHA;  (c) Is a project with a HUD-held mortgage or is a HUD-owned project;  (d) Is assisted, or is a project for which a commitment for assistancehas been entered into, under the Rental Rehabilitation program, 24 CFRPart 511; or  (e) Would require displacement of any person (see paragraph II.D.(2)). (3) Nursing homes; units within the grounds of penal, reformatory, medical,mental, and similar public or private institutions; and facilities providingcontinual psychiatric, medical, or nursing services are not eligible forassistance under this program.  (4) No section 8 assistance may be provided with respect to any unit occupiedby an Owner.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Housing Quality Standards  </ITAG>Section 882.404 (including its incorporation by reference of andSection;882.109) shall apply to this program, except as follows:  (1) The housing quality standards in andSection;andSection; 882.109(i) and882.404(c), concerning lead-based paint, shall not apply to this program,since these SRO units will not house children under seven years of age. (2) In addition to the performance requirements contained in andSection;882.109(p) concerning SRO units, a sprinkler system that protects all majorspaces, hard wired smoke detectors, and such other fire and safety improvementsas State or local law may require shall be installed in each building.(The term ``major spaces'' means hallways, large common areas, and otherareas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes.)(3) Section 882.109(g), concerning shared housing, shall not apply to thisprogram. (4) Section 882.404(b), concerning site and neighborhood standards, shallnot apply to this program, except that andSection; 882.404(b) (1) and (2)shall apply. In addition, the site shall be accessible to social, recreational,educational, commercial, and health facilities, and other appropriate municipalfacilities and services. (5) An SRO unit may contain both food preparation and sanitary facilities;however, in no case may the fair market rents for SRO units (75 percentof the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation fair market rent) be exceeded.<ITAG tagnum="81"> C. Financing </ITAG>Section 882.405 shall apply to this program. <ITAG tagnum="81"> D. Temporary Relocation/Displacement </ITAG>(1) <T3>Temporary Relocation. </T3>The following policies apply to the temporaryrelocation of residential tenants who are required to relocate temporarilyfollowing the date the PHA submits its application to HUD. (a) No tenant shall be required to move temporarily from the property unless:(i) The tenant is provided adequate, advance written notice and appropriateadvisory services; (ii) suitable housing is available for the temporaryperiod; (iii) the temporary relocation period will not exceed 12 months;(iv) the tenant will receive reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocketexpenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, includingmoving costs to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increasein monthly housing costs; and (v) the tenant is provided a reasonable opportunityto lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling inthe same building or a nearby building on the real property following completionof the rehabilitation. (b) The PHA is responsible for assuring that all the temporary relocationrequirements are met. Reasonable relocation costs incurred by the Ownerfor the temporary relocation of tenants to be assisted under this programare considered eligible rehabilitation costs for inclusion in the ContractRents. (Temporary relocation costs for tenants not to be assisted underthis program may not be included in the Contract Rents.) Preliminary administrativefunds may be used for costs of PHA advisory services for the temporaryrelocation of tenants to be assisted under this program. (2) <T3>Displacement. </T3>As indicated in the displacement certification (seeparagraph III.C.(5)), no person (family, individual, business or nonprofitorganization) shall be displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitationor demolition of the structure, whether or not the person occupies a unitassisted under the moderate rehabilitation SRO program. For the purposesof this Notice, a person is displaced if the person is required to movepermanently and involuntarily. However, a person will not be considereddisplaced if (a) the person commences occupancy after the PHA submits theapplication to HUD and, before commencing occupancy, is provided adequatewritten notice from the Owner of the impending rehabilitiation and possibledisplacement; or (b) the person's tenancy is terminated for serious orrepeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease; violationof applicable Federal, State, or local law; or other good cause. (Goodcause does <T3>not </T3>include termination because of Owner participation in thisprogram.) <ITAG tagnum="81"> E. Other Federal Requirements </ITAG>Section 882.407, Other Federal Requirements, shall apply to this program,with the additions and modifications noted below: (1) Executive Orders 12432, Minority Business Enterprise Development, and12138, Creating a National Women's Business Enterprise Policy, shall apply.Consistent with HUD's responsibilities under these Executive Orders andExecutive Order 11625 (see andSection; 882.407(c)(5)), the PHA and Ownershall make efforts to encourage the use of minority and women's businessenterprises in connection with activities assisted under this program.(2) If the procedures that the PHA or Owner, as appropriate, intends touse to make known the availability of this program are unlikely to reachpersons of any particular race, color, religion, sex, age, or nationalorigin who may qualify for admission to the program, the PHA or Owner shallestablish additional procedures that will ensure that such persons aremade aware of the availability of the program. The PHA or Owner shall alsoadopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons can obtaininformation concerning the existence and location of services and facilitieswhich are accessible to handicapped persons. (3) Notwithstanding that structures may serve designated populations ofhomeless persons, the PHA or Owner, as appropriate, is required, in servinga designated population, to comply with the requirements under this paragraphE relating to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religon, sex,age, or national origin. Designated populations of homeless persons mayinclude (but are not limited to) substance abusers and the chronicallymentally ill. In addition, the PHA shall comply with section 504 of theRehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations at 24 CFR Part 8 which prohibitdiscrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with handicaps solelyby reason of handicap. Single-sex facilities are allowable under the Moderate Rehabilitation SROprogram, provided that the PHA determines that because of the physicallimitations or configuration of the facility, consideration of personalprivacy requires that the facility (or parts of the facility) be availableonly to members of a single sex. (4) HUD shall comply with the Coastal Barriers Resources Act (which prohibitsassistance for sites in the coastal barrier resources system identifiedunder that Act). (5) Projects of nine or more assisted units are subject to Davis-BaconAct requirements regarding wage rates paid for rehabilitation work. TheDepartment of Labor has advised that residential, rather than commercial,wage rates apply for buildings of four stories or less being rehabilitatedfor the homeless. (6) In lieu of the provisions of andSection; 882.407(b), the environmentalreview requirements of 24 CFR Part 50, implementing the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act and related environmental laws and authorities listed in 24CFR andSection; 50.4, are applicable to this program. HUD will complete environmentalreviews on applications under this program before selecting PHAs. HUD mayelect to eliminate a proposal from consideration where a proposal wouldrequire an Environmental Impact Statement (generally, where HUD determinesthat the proposal would have a significant effect on the human environment),or where the time necessary for the completion of the review process underan environmental law (e.g., the National Historic Preservation Act) forstructures identified in a particular application would prevent timelycompletion of the selection process. If a successful PHA proposes, afterselection, to enter into an Agreement with respect to a sturcture thatwas not identified in its application, the requirements in paragraph III.F.(10)will be followed. III. PHA Application Process, HUD Review and Selection, ACC Execution,and Pre-Rehabilitation Activities <ITAG tagnum="81"> A. General </ITAG>(1) PHAs that are currently administering a Moderate Rehabilitation Programunder 24 CFR Part 882 are invited to submit applications for this program.There is no application form. Applications shall contain the informationprescribed in paragraph III.C, be addressed to Lawrence Goldberger in Room6130 at the address specified above, and be received by 5:15 p.m. EasternStandard Time on April 10, 1989. Each PHA shall also submit a copy of theapplication to the appropriate HUD field office by the same deadline. HUDwill reject late applications. (2) PHAs have discretion to select proposals by Owners in accordance withtheir own procedures and policies, consistent with the requirements ofthis Notice. Accordingly, andSection; 882.503, Obtaining Proposals from Owners;andSection; 882.504(c) (1), (4), and (5), Selection of Proposals; and andSection;882.504(d) Notification of Owners, shall not apply to this program. (3) HUD headquarters will process all applications and select the successfulPHAs. <ITAG tagnum="81"> B. Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP) </ITAG>(1) Section 401 of the McKinney Act prohibits assistance under this programfrom being made available within the jurisdiction of a State, or a metropolitancity or urban county that is eligible for a formula allocation under theEmergency Shelter Grants program established by the McKinney Act (ESG formulacity or county), unless the entity has a HUD-approved CHAP. For PHAs thatwish to receive funding under this program, the following rules apply.If the structure to be assisted is located <T3>within </T3>an ESG formula city or county, the city or county musthave an approved CHAP. If the structure is located <T3>outside </T3>an ESG formula city or county, the State must have anapproved CHAP. Since Indian tribes are not required to have approved CHAPs,the CHAP requirement does not apply to PHAs seeking funding for structureswithin the jurisdictions of Indian tribes. However, if an Indian tribeseeks to receive funding under this program for a project outside of itsjurisdiction, it would be required to obtain a certification that its proposedactivities are consistent with the CHAP for the jurisdiction in which theactivities are to be located. (2) The Department published a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 14, 1987 (52 FR 30628) establishingrequirements for CHAPs. Among other things, that Notice listed the ESGformula cities and counties and other entities that are subject to theCHAP requirements. The recently enacted reauthorization of the McKinneyAct requires the annual submission of CHAPs. The Department published updatedCHAP requirements on December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52600). Potential applicantsunder this program are encouraged to familiarize themselves with theserequirements. (3) Each CHAP must contain an assurance that each grantee, recipient, andproject sponsor (as appropriate) will administer, in good faith, a policydesigned to ensure that each SRO is free from the illegal use, possession,or distribution of drugs or alcohol by its beneficiaries. CHAP requirementsregarding drug- and alcohol-free facilities are set forth in section III.4of the CHAP Notice published on December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52600). <ITAG tagnum="81"> C. PHA Application </ITAG>Section 441 of the McKinney Act requires that HUD allocate the amountsmade available for this program on the basis of a national competitionto the applicants that best demonstrate a need for the assistance and theability to undertake and carry out a program to be assisted. Each applicationshall contain the following information to enable HUD to make these determinations.(1) <T3>Size and Characteristics of SRO Population. </T3>The application shallinclude a description of the size and characteristics of the homeless populationwithin the applicant's jurisdiction that would occupy SRO dwellings underthis program, and a statement of the basis for this description, (<T3>i.e., </T3>the source of the information). If the PHA intends to servea designated population of homeless persons, such as substance abusersor the chronically mentally ill, the application should identify the designatedpopulation. (2) <T3>Identification of Suitable Housing Stock to Be Rehabilitated UnderThis Program. </T3>(a) The application shall identify specific structures,by address (indicating city and urban county where applicable), that thePHA proposes for rehabilitation and assistance under this program, including:(i) The total number of SRO units requested;(ii) The total number of units in each structure;(iii) The number of vacancies among SRO units to be assisted;(iv) The type of rehabilitation expected; and(v) For applications identifying more than one structure, a priority rankingof the structures in the event that the application can only be partiallyfunded.(b) The application shall also include a description of the interest thathas been expressed by builders, developers, Owners, and others (includingprofit and nonprofit organizations) in participating in the program. Thismay include statements expressing interest in acquiring or rehabilitatingstructures identified in the application or information on site control,and should include a discussion of the relevant development and managementexperience, and the length of experience, of individuals or organizationsthat will participate in the program.(c) The application shall also include a preliminary feasibility analysisfor the structure identified which demonstrates that a preliminary estimateof the gross rents for the structure indicate that the project is feasiblewithin the fair market rent limitation. The analysis should also addressthe structure's compliance with basic program requirements regarding eligibleproperties and tenants, site control, the $1,000 minimum in eligible rehabilitationwork, and eligible work items.(3) <T3>Additional Commitments for Supportive Services. </T3>The applicationshall identify any supportive services (as defined in section VII.B) whichwould be necessary for the population expected to be served. The availabilityof these services should be demonstrated by letters from the agencies (includingpublic and private sources) providing the services. The letters shoulddescribe the services to be provided, the funding source, and the proposedperiod of availability. The PHA shall demonstrate that the supportive servicesappropriately address the needs of the homeless population to be served.The application should address whether these services will be providedin the structure or elsewhere. If elsewhere, the application should demonstratethat the services will be readily accessible to the homeless populationto be served. Services are readily accessible if residents can get to theservices on their own, or if transportation is provided to the site wherethe services are provided.(4) <T3>CHAP Certifications. </T3>The application shall contain a certificationthat each proposed structure is consistent with the appropriate CHAP submittedin accordance with the 1989 requirements referenced in paragraph III.B.The certification shall be from the public official responsible for submittingthe CHAP for the State, formula city or county, or territory and shallindicate that the proposed activities of the PHA are consistent with theCHAP. Such certification must be provided as follows:(a) If the proposed structure is located within the boundaries of a cityor urban county required to submit its own CHAP under the requirementsreferenced in section III.B., then a certification from the appropriateofficial of that jurisdiction is required; or(b) If the proposed structure is not located within such a unit of localgovernment, then a certification from the appropriate State official isrequired.(5) <T3>Displacement Certification. </T3>The application shall contain a certificationfrom the PHA that neither its proposed activities, nor the acquisition,rehabilitation or demolition activities of any Owner whose proposal isselected or considered for selection, will result in the displacement (thepermanent, involuntary move) of any person (family, individual, businessor nonprofit organization).(6) <T3>Section 213 Letter. </T3>Section 213 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1974 requires HUD to provide the chief executive officer of theunit of general local government an opportunity to comment on the application.Where the unit of general local government has a housing assistance plan,its comment may include an objection to HUD approval of an applicationfor housing assistance on the grounds that the application is inconsistentwith the local housing assistance plan. PHAs should encourage the chiefexecutive officer to submit a section 213 letter with the PHA application.(See 24 CFR Part 791 for specific requirements). Since HUD cannot approvean application until the 30-day comment period is closed, the section 213letter should not only comment on the application and indicate that approvalof the application for assistance under this Notice is consistent withthe community's housing assistance plan, where applicable, but should alsostate that HUD may consider the letter to be the final comments, and thatno additional comments will be submitted by the unit of local government.(7) <T3>Schedule. </T3>The application shall contain a schedule for completionof all necessary steps through execution of the Housing Assistance PaymentsContract and demonstrate that it is feasible for the PHA to meet its schedule.The schedule shall specify when the following will be completed:(a) Inspection of units and determination of eligibility of any currentresidents, final feasibility analysis, detailed work write-ups, and costestimates;(b) Determination of initial base rents and Contract Rents;(c) Ensuring that firm commitments of financing and identified necessarysupportive services and other resources to be provided are in place;(d) Execution of the Agreement;(e) Start of rehabilitation activities, with an identification of any whichmay be affected by weather conditions and a discussion of how weather delayshave been taken into account; and(f) Execution of the Contract (must be within 12 months from executionof the ACC).(8) <T3>Administrative Capability and Rehabilitation Expertise. </T3>The applicationshall include a description of the PHA's experience in administering thesection 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program and a description of the PHA'srehabilitation expertise.(9) <T3>Financing.</T3> The application shall indicate the types of financingexpected to be used, including Federal, State, or locally assisted financingprograms, and describe the availability of such financing. If availale,statements from these financing sources indicating their willingness toprovide financing should be submitted.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. HUD Selection Process</ITAG>(1) <T3>Part 791.</T3> Upon receipt of an application that does not includea section 213 letter from the chief executive officer of the unit of generallocal government (see paragraph III.C.(6)), HUD shall send the applicationto the appropriate chief executive officer in accordance with 24 CFR Part791.(2) <T3>Ranking.</T3> Before ranking applications, HUD will complete environmentalreviews required under 24 CFR Part 50 on all applications. HUD may electto eliminate a proposal from consideration where the application wouldrequire an Environmental Impact Statement, or the time necessary for thecompletion of the review process under an enviromental law for structuresidentified in a particular application would prevent timely completionof the ranking and selection process. Except for such eliminated proposals,HUD will rank all applications from PHSs administering the Moderate RehabilitationProgram that contain all items required by section C, based upon HUD'sassessment of which applications have the best combination of the following:(a) The need for assistance, as demonstrated by the PHA's analysis of thesize and characteristics of the population to be served, and by the thoroughnessof the analysis of the need presented; and(b) The PHA's ability to undertake and carry out the program within theschedule proposed by the PHA, as demonstrated by:(i) Whether the preliminary feasibility analysis demonstrates that it appearslikely that the proposed structure will be feasible and meets basic programrequirements;(ii) Whether there is evidence of site control or other evidence that thesite will be available for rehabilitation in accordance with the PHA'sschedule;(iii) The percentage of units proposed for assistance which are vacant(rehabilitation of vacant units generally will result in more units becomningavailable for the homeless; therefore, a preference will be given to applicationsindicating the highest percentage of vacancies);(iv) Whether it appears feasible that the PHA and Owner will complete allsteps necessary so that the Contract may be executed within 12 months ofexecution of the ACC;(v) Whether the PHA has specified the resources available to provide necessarysupportive services, including the strength and length of the commitmentsto provide those resources;(vi) The availability of financing, both assisted and unassisted, as demonstratedby statements or commitments from lenders, with a preference for assistedfinancing availability; and(vii) The PHA's experience with rehabilitation programs, including pastperformance in placing Moderate Rehabilitation units under Agreement andContract, and the PHA's overall administrative capability, as evaluatedby the HUD field office.HUD shall assign a maximum of 30 points based on paragraph (a) and 70 pointsbased on paragraph (b), with an equal maximum amount of points (10) foreach element in paragraph (b).3. <T3>Selection of Applications. </T3>(a) HUD will select the highest rankingapplications. However, no city or urban county may have projects receivinga total of more than 10 percent of the assistance to be provided underthis program ($4,500,000 in budget authority, which is the equivalent of$450,000 in administratively controlled contract authority per year, whichHUD expects will fund a maximum of approximately 120 units for any onecity or urban county).(b) HUD will notify each PHA whether or not its application has been selected.(c) Where the review and comment process required under 24 CFR Part 791has not been completed by the time HUD is ready to make its selections,it may select one or more applications subject to completion of the processrequired under Part 791, if it has determined that the application is consistentwith a housing assistance plan (where applicable). See, also, paragraphsIII.C(6) and III.D.(1).<ITAG tagnum="81">E. ACC Execution</ITAG>(1) Before execution of the ACC, the PHA shall submit to the appropriateHUD field office the following:(a) Equal Opportunity Housing Plan and Certification, Form HUD-920; (b) Estimates of Required Annual Contributions, Forms HUD-52672 and HUD-52673;(c) Administrative Plan, which should include:(i) Procedures for tenant outreach and for establishing waiting lists;(ii) A policy governing temporary relocation; and (iii) A mechanism to monitor the provision of supportive services. (d) Proposed Schedule of Allowances for Tenant-Furnished Utilities andOther Services, Form HUD-52667, with a justification of the amounts proposed;(e) If applicable, proposed variations to the accceptability criteria ofthe Housing Quality Standards (see section II.B); and (f) The fire and building code applicable to each structure. (2) After HUD approves the PHA's application, the review and comment requirementsof 24 CFR Part 791 have been complied with, and the PHA has submitted (andHUD has approved) the items required by paragraph III.E(1), HUD and thePHA shall execute the ACC in the form prescribed by HUD. The initial termof the ACC shall be 11 years. This allows one year to rehabilitate theunits and place them under a 10-year HAP Contract. The ACC will establisha separate term for the funding provided in Fiscal Year 1989 for this program.The ACC shall give HUD the option to renew the ACC for an additional 10years. (3) Section 882.403(a), Maximum Total ACC Commitments, shall apply to thisprogram. (4) Section 882.403(b), Project Account, shall apply to this program. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Project Development</ITAG>Before execution of the Agreement, the PHA shall:(1)(a) Inspect the structure to determine the specific work items whichneed to be accomplished to bring the units to be assisted up to the HousingQuality Standards (see section II.B) or other standards approved by HUD;(b) Conduct a feasibility analysis, and determine whether cost-effectiveenergy conserving improvements can be added; (c) ensure that the Ownerprepares the work write/ups and cost estimates required by andSection; 882.504(f);and (d) determine initial base rents and Contract Rents;(2) Assure that the Owner has selected a contractor in accordance withandSection; 882.504(g); (3) After the financing and a contractor are obtained, determine whethercosts can be covered by initial Contract Rents, computed in accordancewith section III.G; and, where a structure contains more than 50 unitsto be assisted, submit the base rent and Contract Rent calculations tothe appropriate HUD field office for review and approval in sufficienttime for execution of the Agreement in a timely manner;(4) Obtain firm commitments to provide necessary supportive services; (5) Obtain firm commitments for other resources to be provided; (6) Determine that the $1,000 minimum amount of work requirement and otherrequirements in andSection; 8821.504(c) (2) and (3) are met;(7) Determine eligibility of current tenants, and select the units to beassisted in accordance with andSection; 882.504(e);(8) Comply with the financing requirements in andSection; 882.504(i);(9) Assure compliance with all other applicable requirements of this Notice;and (10) In the event that the PHA determine that any structure proposed inits application is infeasible, or the PHA proposes to select a differentstructure for any other reason, the PHA must submit the information requiredin III.C.(2) for the selected structure to HUD Headquarters for reviewand approval and to the HUD Field Office for environmental review, as requiredby II.E(6). HUD Headquarters will rate the proposed structure in accordancewith the procedures in III.D. The proposed structure must rank at leastas high as the lowest ranked application selected for funding in FiscalYear 1989. If the PHA fails to submit a structure of such ranking, HUDmay reduce the amount of annual contributions payable or reduce the fundingreserved for the structure. The PHA may not proceed to Agreement executionuntil it is notified by HUD and all requirements for the proposed structurehave been met. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Initial Contract Rents</ITAG>Section 882.408, Initial Contract Rents (including the establishment offair market rents for SRO units at 75 percent of the 0-bedroom ModerateRehabilitation Fair Market Rent), shall apply to this program, except asfollows: (1)(a) In determining the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan, in accordancewith andSection; 882.408(c)(2), a 10-year loan term (instead of a 15-yearloan term) shall be assumed. The exception in andSection; 882.408(c)(2)(iii)for using the actual loan term where the total amount of the rehabilitationis less than $15,000 shall continue to apply. In addition, the cost forthe rehabilitation that may be included for the purpose of calculatingthe amount of the initial Contract Rent for any unit shall not exceed thelower of (i) the projected costs of rehabilation, or (ii) $14,300 per unit,plus the cost of the fire and safety improvements required by section II.B.(2).HUD may, however, increase the limitation in clause (ii) by an amount HUDdetermines is reasonable and necessary to accommodate special local conditions,including high construction costs or stringent fire or building codes.(b) Where the PHA believes that high construction costs warrant an increasein the limitation in clause (a)(ii) above, the PHA shall demonstrate toHUD's satisfaction that a high average per unit amount is necessary toconduct this program and that every appropriate step has been taken tocontain the amount of the rehabilitation within an average of $14,300 perunit, plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements. Thesehigher amounts will be determined as follows:(i) HUD may approve a higher per unit amount up to, but not to exceed,an amount derived by applying the HUD-approved High Cost Percentage forBase Cities (used for computing FHA high cost area adjustments) in usebefore April 1988, for the area to the total of the $14,300 per unit costand the cost of the required fire and safety improvements; or(ii) HUD may, on a structure-by-structure basis, increase the level approvedin paragraph (i) to up to an amount computed by multiplying 2.4 by thetotal of the $14,300 average per unit cost and the cost of the requiredfire and safety improvements.(2) In approving changes to initial Contract Rents during rehabilitationin accordance with andSection; 882.408(d), the revised Contract Rents maynot reflect an average per unit rehabilitation cost that exceeds the limitationspecified in paragraph G.(1) of this section.(3) Where the structure contains four or fewer SRO units, the Fair MarketRent for that size structure (the Fair Market Rent for a 1-, 2-, 3-, or4-bedroom unit, as applicable) shall apply instead of a separate Fair MarketRent for each SRO unit. The Fair Market Rent for the structure shall beapportioned to each SRO unit.(4) Contract Rents shall not include the costs of providing supportiveservices, transportation, furniture, or other non-housing costs, as determinedby HUD. Also, contract rents shall not include the additional costs ofrehabilitation and operating efficiency units. PHAs shall consult withHUD where it is not clear whether the cost may be covered by the ContractRent.IV.

However, if the PHA is unable to refer a sufficient number of interestedapplicants on the waiting lists to the Owner within 30 days of the Owner'snotification to the PHA of a vacancy, the Owner may advertise or solicitapplications from homeless persons, and refer such persons to the PHA todetermine eligibility. Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection,the Owner may refuse any Individual, provided that the Owner does not unlawfullydiscriminate. Should the Owner reject an Individual, and should the Individualbelieve that the Owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination,the Individual may request the assistance of the PHA in resolving the issueand may also file a complaint with HUD.

Section 882.402 shall apply to this program, except that: (1) With respect to the definition of Moderate Rehabilitation, in determiningcompliance with the $1,000 minimum expenditure required to qualify as ModerateRehabilitation, the cost of the repair or replacement of major buildingsystems or components in danger of failure shall not be counted; and (2) With respect to the definition of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing,the requirement that an SRO unit must be located within a multifamily structureconsisting of more than 12 units shall not apply. B. In addition to the definitions contained in andSection; 882.402, the followingdefinitions shall apply to this program:<T3>Eligible Individual (``Individual'').</T3> A lower income individualwho, taking into account the supportive services available to the individual,is capable of independent living as a ``Family'' or ``Single Person'' under24 CFR Part 812. <T3>Homeless Individual.</T3> An individual who_ (1) Is an Eligible Individual;(2) Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and (3) Has a primary nighttime residence that is_ (a) A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to providetemporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters,and transitional housing for the mentally ill); (b) An institution that provides a temporary residence for individualsintended to be institutionalized; or (c) A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as,a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.

The term does not include major medical equipment. VIII. Waivers<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Authority to Waive Provisions of this Notice  </ITAG>Upon determination of good cause, the Assistant Secretary for Housing_FederalHousing Commissioner may, subject to statutory limtations, waive any provisionof this Notice. Each such waiver shall be in writing and shall be supportedby documentation of the pertinent facts and grounds.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Waiver of the Limitation and Preference in the Second and ThirdSentences of Section 3(b)(3) of the 1937 Act  </ITAG>Section 8(n) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 authorizes HUD, in appropriatecases involving SRO housing, to waive the limitation and preference inthe second and third sentences of section 3(b)(3) of that Act. The secondsentence of section 3(b)(3) limits to 15 percent the number of units underthe jurisdiction of any PHA which can be occupied by ``other single persons''(those who do not qualify as elderly, displaced, or the remaining memberof a tenant family). The third sentence requires a preference for personswho are elderly, handicapped, or displaced over other single persons. The Department believes that waiver of the limitation and preference isappropriate for this program since many of those who will occupy this housingprobably would not be subject to the 15 percent limitation and, therefore,would qualify for the preference. Therefore, in light of the administrativeburden involved for the few who may be subject to the 15 percent limitation,HUD hereby waives these provisions for purposes of this program. In addition,any regulations implementing the percentage limitation or the preferenceshall not apply to units assisted under this Notice. The authority elsewherein section 3(b)(3) to ``increase the [15 percent] limitation describedin the second sentence'' to 30 percent does not apply, since the limitationin the second sentence has been waived and there is no applicable limitationin the second sentence to ``increase.''IX. Significant Changes From Fiscal Year 1988 Notice  This Notice tracks for the most part the Notice published for Fiscal Year1988. However, for the convenience of the reader, below is a listing ofthe significant changes which have been made and are not discussed previouslyunder <T3>Background.</T3>  1. <T3>II.B. Housing Quality Standards </T3>has been changed to add a fifthprovision that an SRO unit may contain both food preparation and sanitaryfacilities, but that in no case may the fair market rents for SRO units(75 percent of the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation fair market rent)be exceeded.  2. <T3>II.D. Temporary Relocation/Displacement </T3>has been revised to removethe reference to 24 CFR 882.406(a) regarding applicability of the UniformRelocation Act because the Notice sets forth specific policies regardingtemporary relocation and displacement as they apply to this program. Theserequirements are basically the same as those contained in the Fiscal Year1988 Notice except that (a) temporary relocation may not exceed 12 months(as opposed to six months) and (b) the tenant must be provided a reasonableopportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitarydwelling in the same building or nearby building following completion ofthe rehabiltiation.  3. <T3>II.E. Other Federal Requirements </T3>has been changed to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Add a statement to paragraph (3) indicating that single-sex facilitiesare allowable under certain circumstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Add a provision that Davis-Bacon Act requirements regarding wagerates paid for rehabilitation work apply to projects of nine or more assistedunits, and that residential, rather than commercial, wage rates shall applyfor buildings of four stories or less being rehabilitated for the homeless.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Add a paragaph regarding the environmental review requirements thatmust be met before selection of successful PHAs.</ITAG>4. <T3>III.C.
