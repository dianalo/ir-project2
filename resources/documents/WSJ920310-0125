YourFeb. 28 editorial &quot;Press-Release Ozone Hole&quot; helps restoreobjectivity to this important topic.   Alarming the public through scary press releases seems tohave gained respectability. But scientists who make doomsdaypredictions risk causing further erosion of the public'sdiminishing respect for the credibility of their profession.Consider the unfulfilled apocalypse predicted by Carl Saganlast year on ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; (Jan. 22, 1991). The Kuwaitioil fires, Mr. Sagan intoned, could cause &quot;massiveagricultural failures&quot; and &quot;very serious human suffering, andin some cases starvation.&quot; And where would this catastropheoccur? &quot;Especially for South Asia, that seems to be in thecards,&quot; Mr. Sagan said, &quot;and perhaps for a significantfraction of the Northern Hemisphere.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Ozone prophets should keep the Sagan scenario in mind. Ithas been widely reported that global ozone levels declinedduring the 1980s. But few reports have noted that ozone roseduring the 1960s, and that the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration found no observable up or downtrend in ozone over Hawaii and Samoa from 1976 to 1990.   Yes, there is real concern among most scientists I'veinterviewed about the effect on ozone of increased levels ofchlorine in the stratosphere. And since no one canconclusively say how much of the ozone's ebb and flow iscaused by volcanoes, natural atmospheric cycles andchlorofluorocarbon (CFC) molecules, continued monitoring andstudy are in order.   Meanwhile, the ozone is certainly not &quot;vanishing,&quot; asclaimed on the cover of Time, and I can safely predict thatthere will be no &quot;hole&quot; in the ozone over the U.S. thissummer. If the El Nino goes away, we'll have more cold frontsnext winter and ozone levels will probably rise.   Forrest M. Mims III   Editor, Science Probe   Seguin, Texas   ---   Clearly, fact vs. supposition is necessary to ensure theright action is taken by our nation's policy makers andpublic regarding CFCs. Virtually all aerosol sprays producedand sold in the U.S. (deodorant or otherwise, as yourcommentary suggests) do not contain CFC propellants. In 1975our company, S.C. Johnson, removed all CFC propellants fromits aerosols world-wide, thereby establishing an industrystandard. When three U.S. government agencies banned CFCpropellants in all but a minuscule number of medically exemptaerosols, that standard became law.   Recent Roper studies show that 86% of Americans areunaware of the U.S. ban on CFC propellants in aerosols andthat the vast majority of the public identifies the media asits primary source for environmental information. Americansshould not avoid aerosols in an effort to save the ozonelayer; rather they should repair leaky home and auto airconditioners, which do release CFCs.   Jane M. Hutterly   Director   Environmental Actions World-Wide   S.C. Johnson andamp; Son Inc.   Racine, Wis.   ---   You inaccurately accused the Bush administration offormulating &quot;policy via press releases&quot; in regard to thepresident's decision to accelerate the phase-out of CFCs andother ozone-depleting gases. You are dead wrong to link thedecision only to a Feb. 3 news conference on the secondAirborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE-II).Continuing deliberations were intensified following initialresults last fall of the U.N.'s periodic assessment ofstratospheric ozone science. The findings discussed at thenews conference did not by themselves prompt Mr. Bush'sdecision.   You are also off-base in questioning the motives of NASA.Knowing that AASE-II results would garner considerable publicattention, government scientists decided to schedule the newsconference. By doing so, they ensured that the public wouldreceive timely, scientifically accurate information about acomplex issue -- just what the public needs. Furthermore, adecision not to release the results inevitably would havebeen depicted in the press as an effort to conceal troublingnews.   Michael R. Deland   Chairman   President's Council on Environmental Quality   Washington   ---   Again you've adopted the &quot;wait and see&quot; approach on theozone layer. The president and Congress have acted in thepast to make the shift from known ozone-depletion elements byindustry to more benign elements least painful. But it isbecoming increasingly obvious that this policy is notcompatible with the accelerated denigration of ozone. NASAhas provided the administration and Congress with apolitically correct excuse to revisit this issue and outlinea more realistic timetable with which to address ozonedepletion.   Do you propose that we all await concrete evidence thatthe ozone layer has been seriously breached in any part ofthe world in order to justify the use of prudent anddefensive measures? Old enemies are beginning to rebuild fromyears of totalitarianism. New enemies are on our horizon,which threaten our very existence as a species on thisplanet. Ozone depletion is just one of them.   Ozone depletion is elemental. It is neither social norpolitical. It cannot be manufactured or purchased for ahigher price when it is gone. Your commentary has theresounding hollowness of Neville Chamberlain when he assuredus all that German aggression was under control prior to thehostilities of World War II.   T.P.
