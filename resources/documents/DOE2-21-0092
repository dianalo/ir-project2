Each assembly contained 19 fuel pinswith {similar_to} 2.5 kg of DU and inbred plutonium ranging from 10 to450 g per assembly. The Rockwell International Hot Laboratory (RIHL)disassembled the fuel pins, removed the sodium bond material, and shippedthe fuel slugs to the Savannah River Plant for reprocessing and plutoniumrecovery. In all, 6783 fuel pins containing 76.181 kg of plutonium weredeclad for reprocessing. To process the large number of fuel pins inan expedient manner, a 400-W neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet(YAG) laser was used to cut the cladding. The laser resulted in a high-capacityprocess.</TEXT></DOC>
