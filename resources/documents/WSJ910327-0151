The possible proposal by Charles Bowsher, the comptrollergeneral, also would prohibit accounting firms that auditthese banks from doing tax and consulting work for the samebanks.</LP><TEXT>   The accounting profession is abuzz about the possibleproposal because Mr. Bowsher last month discussed it with theheads of the six biggest U.S. accounting firms. InWashington, a spokesman for the General Accounting Office,which Mr. Bowsher heads, declined comment on the proposal. Hesaid that Mr. Bowsher was unavailable for comment.   Shaun O'Malley, chairman and senior partner of PriceWaterhouse, which audits nine of the 50 largest banks,confirmed that Mr. Bowsher had discussed the proposal withMr. O'Malley in Washington in mid-February and has alsodiscussed it with the heads of the five other majoraccounting firms.   Mr. O'Malley estimated that rotation of auditing firmsevery five or seven years could boost auditing fees by &quot;atleast 10% to 15%.&quot; He said that this increase in costprobably wouldn't improve audit quality. &quot;The vast majorityof audit failures occur in the first three years of anaudit,&quot; Mr. O'Malley said. &quot;To me, that's a good reason tooppose auditor rotation.&quot;   Mr. O'Malley said that he expressed strong opposition toMr. Bowsher's possible proposal. &quot;We in the accountingprofession don't believe that it will be productive in termsof what the regulators and the auditing profession are tryingto achieve,&quot; Mr. O'Malley added.   Accountants and legislative aides with whom Mr. Bowsherhas discussed the proposal say that Mr. Bowsher hasn't yetmade a decision to pursue the auditor-rotation proposal inCongress. But they say that he is &quot;extremely concerned&quot; thatthere has been a breakdown in the independence of outsideauditors of some collapsed thrifts and banks. The breakdownoccurred when the auditors were too easily taken in bymanagement, which was commiting fraud, or when the auditorsbecame advocates for the collapsed institution, they add.   In a report issued earlier this month, the GAO, which isthe chief accounting arm of Congress, recommended thatCongress take steps &quot;to deal with the extraordinary risks tothe Bank Insurance Fund from large banks.&quot; The report urgestougher financial reporting requirements and suggests thatbank management prepare an annual financial forecast thatshould be reviewed by independent public accountants.   The report also notes that the GAO will soon have otherrecommendations involving accounting and other reforms&quot;designed to improve information on the condition of bankingorganizations.&quot; It adds: &quot;Special accounting rules and auditprocedures need to be developed&quot; to ensure that certaintransactions of the banks and their affiliates arescrutinized for &quot;their economic substance.&quot;   Of the 50 biggest banks, 15 are audited by KPMG PeatMarwick, 14 by Ernst andamp; Young and nine by Price Waterhouse.Listing accounting firms by the size of bank assets theyaudit, Peat audits 35% of the assets of the 50 banks, Ernst andamp;Young 25% and Price Waterhouse 23%.   Robert Elliott, a Peat partner and assistant to JonMadonna, Peat's chairman, professional and strategic issues,said that Mr. Bowsher telephoned Mr. Madonna in earlyFebruary to discuss the auditor-rotation proposal. &quot;We're nothappy about the proposal,&quot; Mr. Elliott said. &quot;We feel thatthe more accountants know about banks they audit, the lessrisk that they will overlook problems of those banks,&quot; Mr.Elliott said.   Mr. Elliott noted that in England, it's very difficult fora bank to fire an outside auditor while in Canada audit-firmrotation is required. &quot;We hope that because of these oppositeviewpoints that Mr. Bowsher is open to argument about auditorrotation,&quot; Mr. Elliott said.   Mr. O'Malley pointed out that the major accounting firmsare required to rotate the engagement partner on all theiraudits under rules from a self-regulatory unit of theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to whichthe firms belong. &quot;We feel this is a sufficient incentive forindependence and requiring more wouldn't work as well,&quot; Mr.O'Malley said.</TEXT></DOC>
