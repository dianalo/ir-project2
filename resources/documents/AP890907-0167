The restrictions were included in an $11.9 billion spending billfor fiscal 1990 transportation programs that the SenateAppropriations Committee adopted by a 17-0 vote. The measure isexpected to reach the full Senate next week.   ``It's time to get on with protecting public health and safety,and this is one way to make certain that happens,'' said the sponsorof the restrictions, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.   By 18-11, the lawmakers rejected an attempt by Sen. Thad Cochran,R-Miss., to water down the proposal by making permanent the currentban on smoking on flights of two hours or less.   The issue, as usual, cut across party lines: Democrats on thepanel opposed Cochran by an 11-5 margin, while Republicans did thesame, 7-6.   The committee also rejected 15-8 an amendment by Sen. ErnestHollings, D-S.C., that would have forbidden both smoking and alcoholdrinking aboard airliners.   Current restrictions, which will otherwise expire next April,cover 80 percent of all U.S. airline routes. Lautenberg's proposalwould take effect 90 days after the bill becomes law, and wouldsupersede the current prohibition if enacted before April.   House-Senate negotiators must now work out compromise languagebefore sending the measure to President Bush for his signature. TheHouse voted Aug. 3 to make the current prohibition permanent.   The vote spelled yet another defeat for the tobacco industry andedged health groups and airline employee unions a step closer towardtheir latest victory.   Supporters of the ban argue that with the recirculated air ofairline cabins, non-smoking passengers face the risk of lung cancerand other diseases by breathing cigarette smoke.   Opponents have claimed that health hazards from the fumes areunproven, and that the ban hurts people who rely on cigarette salesfor their jobs.   ``The previous system of separating smokers from non-smokersworked and made the vast majority of people happy,'' said BrennanDawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, the trade group formost of the nation's cigarette manufacturers. The industry pocketed$35 billion in sales last year.   As under current law, Lautenberg's extension would levy fines ofup to $1,000 for passengers caught smoking and up to $2,000 forpeople found to have disconnected smoke detectors in aircraftrestrooms. Lavatories are considered the most dangerous spot for afire on an airliner because of the paper stored there, but they alsotend to attract smokers trying to light up in secret.   Cigar and pipe smoking has been prohibited aboard airliners since1983.   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., were sponsors of thecurrent smoking ban, which was enacted in 1987.   The spending bill would provide $7.3 billion for aviationprograms, $3 billion for the Coast Guard, $12.2 billion for highwayspending, $3 billion for mass transit assistance, and $615 millionfor Amtrak, the Northeast passenger railroad. Besides the $11.9billion in new spending, the measure would also allow $15.9 billionto be spent from money the government has collected from variousfuel and airline passenger taxes.   The Bush administration proposed spending $10 billion fortransportation in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, with lowerspending for mass transit, higher spending for aviation, and noassistance for Amtrak.   The Senate measure includes:   _$35.5 million for subsidies paid to airlines that serve smallcommunities. The House version of the bill would provide $12.4million.   _$1.2 million for a commission on aviation terrorism thatPresident Bush created last month   _A requirement that the Transportation Department study whatlegal changes would be needed to allow the Coast Guard to fire onsuspected drug smugglers.   As usual with spending bills, the measure contained funds forprojects in the home states of members of the subcommittee.   Thus, it bore $500,000 for New Jersey state officials to work onblocking drug trafficking on interstate highways in Lautenberg'shome state.   There was another $20 million to complete a state highway nearCorning, N.Y., represented by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York,ranking Republican on the panel.</TEXT></DOC>
