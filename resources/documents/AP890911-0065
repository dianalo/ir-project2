Yeltsin said today thatMikhail Gorbachev has about six months to a year to achieve domesticprogress or face revolution.   Unless the Soviet president can show progress during that time,Yeltsin said, ``We're going to have some very difficult times. Andthis is something I want to discuss with the Americanadministration.''   Yeltsin said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that by``difficult times'' he means ``movement from below. It meansrevolution from below.'' He added it already has begun in the formof strikes, which are isolated but could spread and affect theentire country.   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovasserted that Yeltsin was expressing his own views and not those ofthe Soviet government.   Yeltsin and other deputies of the Soviet parliament on visits tothe United States ``are all unofficial delegations,'' Gerasimov saidat a news conference.   A deputy has a right to his opinion, Gerasimov said, ``but itdoesn't necessarily coincide with the government's point of view.''   ``If you want the official point of view, listen to the ForeignMinistry,'' he said. ``If you want pluralism, listen to thedeputies.''   On Sunday, Yeltsin said newly elected Soviet officials will takepower from the Communist Party into their own hands as Gorbachev'sfortunes decline.   ``We're having an economic crisis, a financial crisis, apolitical crisis, the living standard is falling,'' Yeltsin said ata news conference Sunday during his first trip to the United States.   ``We need a person who is more decisive than Gorbachev,'' hesaid, adding that a revolution by the masses would be needed because``we're not really getting a revolution from above.''   But Yeltsin, chairman of a newly-formed independent caucus in theSoviet Congress, ruled out the possibility of a coup.   ``A coup d'etat is pretty unrealistic,'' said Yeltsin, whoarrived in New York on Saturday to begin a private trip of about twoweeks sponsored by the Esalen Institute's Soviet-American ExchangeProgram.   Yeltsin, 58, lost his position as Moscow's Communist party chiefin 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under Gorbachev.But this year he was elected with 90 percent of the vote to theSoviet Congress, where he is an outspoken member of a radical bloc.   He said his country should learn from American democracy whilechanging its own political system.   ``We have to take what is positive ... from America's more than200 years of democratic experience, and on the basis of that createa new model of socialism,'' he said on CBS News' ``Face the Nation.''   ``I think you have a very healthy society here,'' he said. ``Itseems as if capitalism is not rotting away and will not soon rotitself into extinction as we were told _ rather it seems to beprospering.''   Yeltsin said he hoped to meet with President Bush to discuss howthe United States ``could participate in measures to rescueperestroika.''   But he said he has received no indication from the White Houseabout the possibility of such a meeting.   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said he was not aware ofYeltsin's desire to meet with Bush and that there were no plans forsuch as a meeting.   Yeltsin said the Soviet Union needs a new model of socialism,possibly including a multi-party system.   ``We have to stop being so dogmatic as we were before,'' he said.   He said the countries of Eastern Europe that were once ``pulledalong'' by the Soviet Union have now ``overtaken it.''   ``They're now pulling us along, because they can at least feedand clothe their own citizens.''   The $25,000 fees sponsors say Yeltsin will receive for speechesduring his tour will help fund AIDS research in the Soviet Union.   Appearances have been announced in New York, Philadelphia,Chicago, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Dallas, Miami andWashington, although final details of the schedule were not set.   Sitting with reporters in the Central Park apartment of hisAmerican host, Yeltsin said he felt ``twice as free'' after circlingthe Statue of Liberty in a helicopter.   His 24 hours in New York had changed his ideas about America from``the impression which has been pounded into my head in theU.S.S.R.,'' he said.   ``Americans are in no way aggressive or badly behaved _ in fact,they are very polite and optimistic, lively, well-intentioned andknow how to live and know how to work.''</TEXT></DOC>
