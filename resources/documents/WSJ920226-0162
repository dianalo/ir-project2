In a related move, Chemical Banking Corp. has agreed toorganize a group of lenders to provide Reliance Electric with$650 million in bank financing to replace high-cost debt andhelp strengthen the emerging Cleveland company's balancesheet, industry bankers said.</LP><TEXT>   Reliance, which makes industrial and telecommunicationsequipment, plans to file its offering with the Securities andExchange Commission within two weeks. A Reliance spokesmandeclined to say how proceeds of the IPO would be used.   With the IPO, Reliance will become the latest of the 1980sleveraged buy-outs, including York International Corp. andDuracell International Inc., to return to public ownership,thus reducing debt and providing hefty returns to originalinvestors. In the case of Reliance, original investorssupplied $39.2 million in equity; the company reportedlyvalues its 22.2 million shares of common at around $700million, or roughly $31.50 a share. That translates into a77% annual return over the five years, said Edward Mally, ananalyst at Salomon Brothers.   The company did not file a prospectus for the offering,and a company spokesman said Reliance hasn't yet determinedhow many shares would be sold or the per-share price.   An IPO would pave the way for Reliance's largest owner,Citicorp, to cash out on its 43% stake, which it paid about$16.8 million for and which is now valued at an estimated$300 million. The New York bank isn't, however, sellingshares in the company at this time.   Other holders of common equity are Prudential SecuritiesInc., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, with13%, and Reliance management and employees, 19%. Debentureholders have the remaining 25% interest.   Last year, Reliance, under pressure from Citicorp eager toexit its investment, actively sought an outside buyer withassistance from Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Talks with Siemens AG, aGerman electrical conglomerate, ended in December when thetwo sides couldn't agree on Reliance's value. The pressure onReliance to find a buyer eased somewhat when Citicorp saw again on its investment through a new accounting method thatvalues equity investments at or near market value.   In December, when talks with Siemens ended, John C.Morley, Reliance president and chief executive officer, saidhe couldn't foresee doing an IPO sooner than the second halfof 1992. But people close to Reliance say the companyaccelerated the timetable because investors have become hoton companies that are reducing debt.   Russell Leavitt, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, saidReliance has a reputation as &quot;a high quality company with astrengthened balance sheet and a strong position in electricmotors.&quot; Adds Maureen Lentz, an analyst with Roulston andamp; Co.,&quot;It's a good time to do an IPO. The stock market's high andthe value placed on industrial stocks is higher this quarterdue to interest rate cuts.&quot;   Reliance, which had 1991 sales of $1.5 billion, hasoperated privately since December 1986 when a management-ledinvestor group purchased it from Exxon Corp. It has sincereduced initial debt to $600 million from $1.2 billion, andhas no outstanding bank loans, making it attractive tolenders, analysts say.   Meanwhile, as part of its refinancing, Reliance said itmay repurchase, with cash and bank credit, $100 million ofsubordinated debt and preferred stock. The company has atotal of $710 million of outstanding debt and preferredstock.   Reliance yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of$7 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $391 million,down 36% from $11 million, or 31 cents a share, a yearearlier. Sales rose slightly to $391 million from $388million. For the year, Reliance earned $34 million, or 67cents a share, compared with $48 million, or $1.34 a share,in 1990. Sales were flat.</TEXT></DOC>
