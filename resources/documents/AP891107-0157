The results arenot optimal, but they are very good,'' said Fernando CesarMesquita, the president of the Brazilian Institute of Environmentand Renewable Natural Resources.   The destruction could have been curbed even more, Mesquita said,if the United States, Britain, France, Italy and West Germany hadprovided requested aid for ecological protection.   ``Regrettably, we didn't get any help,'' he said.   The institute was founded earlier this year amid aninternational outcry over the devastation of Brazil's 2million-square-mile Amazon jungle, the world's largest. Mesquitasaid he went to the United States and Europe to seek money forradar-mapping equipment, patrol helicopters, patrol boats,four-wheel drive vehicles and telecommunications gear.   He said he couldn't get the equipment from his own government,``because Brazil just doesn't have the money.'' However, he said,Brazilian sources provided five patrol helicopters that wereinstrumental in spotting unauthorized tree cutting and burning.   Last year, illegal land clearing by farmers, ranchers,prospectors and peasant settlers wrecked some 55,350 square milesof Brazilian rainforest, according to the government.   The heaviest rains in more than five years also helped saveAmazonian trees from being burned, Mesquita said.   The institute, which supervises only 612 forest rangers in aregion about half the size of Europe, summarily removed localforest officials suspected of corruption and protecting landownerswho were destroying the ecology, Mesquita said. Inspectorsdiscovered 300,000 acres of illegally cleared jungle land from Aug.1-Nov. 3 and levied fines of about $16 million.   ``The situation is very difficult,'' Mesquita said. ``We are upagainst powerful interests. They try to buy off forest officials,and when that doesn't work they threaten to kill them.''   He said one federal official on an inspection mission was killedthis year, others were shot at or intimidated, and an institutehelicopter was sabotaged.   Also hindering environmental control are the growing cocainetrade, landless peasants, rough free-lance gold miners and``sinister bureaucracy,'' he said.   Amazon protection will be ``a hot potato'' for Brazil's nextpresident, Mesquita said. President Jose Sarney, who has announcedwide-ranging pro-ecology measures, leaves office in March. Voterswill choose his successor Nov. 15 in Brazil's first directpresidential vote since 1960.   None of the 22 presidential candidates ``has presented reallyserious proposals for protecting the environment,'' Mesquita said.   Brazil's small Green Party does have a presidential contender,but polls give him almost no chance of winning.   Mesquita said the institute is trying to get Congress to changea law that encourages settlement in the Amazon region by givingland-tax discounts to settlers who absorb the expense of clearingup to 50 percent of their land.   ``The idea of that law was to promote development and at thesame time protect at least 50 percent of the rainforest. But whathappens is that someone sells half his land, and the next guyclears 50 percent of that, and so on, until there's nothing left.''   With a $110 billion foreign debt, the highest in the developingworld, Brazil is open to foreign proposals for debt-for-ecologyswaps, Mesquita said, but it hasn't received any.</TEXT></DOC>
