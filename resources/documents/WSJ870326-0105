The suit was brought by a man employed by a California public agency who was passed over for a promotion in favor of a woman with a lower job evaluation. In its decision supporting the California agency, the high court reaffirmed the idea of voluntary affirmative action by employers, upholding for the first time hiring goals designed to correct discrimination based on sex, rather than race.    Women's professional organizations and businesses across the country said the ruling will clarify and support current programs. &quot;I see this decision not as something that requires action, but as something that enables action,&quot; said Arlene Johnson, vice president, programs, for New York-based Catalyst, an advisory and research organization that works with corporations on the leadership development of women.    &quot;This decision is a signal more than anything, a statement about the environment, a barometer, and I think that's how it will be taken,&quot; Ms. Johnson said.    Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in women's rights cases, said, &quot;I think it's a very important decision. It means that employers can set up voluntary action plans to attempt to bring women into their work force in jobs traditionally held by men without fearing they will suffer legal liability because they have implemented such a plan.&quot;    She said many employers have avoided setting up such plans because they feared legal retribution. &quot;Now there's no good reason why not to set up such a plan,&quot; Ms. Allred said.    Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Washington-based Women's Legal Defense Fund, said the group is ecstatic about the decision. &quot;Once and for all, the Supreme Court has said that sex discrimination which is unlawful in federal employment under federal law can be remedied with the use of affirmative action, just like race discrimination.&quot;    Among executive recruitment firms, the view is that women are making great gains, but still have some important image obstacles to overcome.    For example, Heidrick andamp; Struggles Inc., an executive search company in New York, conducted a survey in 1986 of more than 200 women officers in Fortune 1000 companies. Of those women, 72.3% held the title of assistant vice president, executive vice president, senior vice president, or group vice president. A similar survey in 1980 found that just over 35% of women corporate officers held those titles.    However, more than 55% of the women surveyed said they believed that an increase in the number of self-employed women resulted from management's continuing discomfort with women in executive jobs. Moreover, nearly 70% said they believed that people equate the word &quot;leadership&quot; with men.    A 1986 survey by Korn-Ferry International Inc., a New York-based executive recruiting company, also found that more women are taking executive jobs. The study of vice presidents of major publicly held corporations found that 2.1% of the respondents were female, compared with 0.5% of the same group in 1979.    Still, Carl Menk, an executive recruiter with Canny, Bowen Inc., New York, said female candidates for top jobs often don't have the degree of experience that men do. &quot;The man will have reached a higher level of responsibility earlier than a woman. That's the first thing. The second is that the woman will have changed jobs more frequently. Those two elements will have clients saying that she's not as qualified.&quot; Mr. Menk said a positive effect of the Supreme Court decision will be that it will &quot;open up an avenue to promote someone you wouldn't want to promote before because of a feeling they weren't qualified.&quot;    Companies and business groups generally said they expect the ruling to make life easier for employers and make progress more likely for female employees.    &quot;It tells employers who are adopting voluntary affirmative action plans that they won't face reverse discrimination suits,&quot; said James F. Conway, director, human resources and equal opportunities, for the National Association of Manufacturers. The association is a Washington-based group with 13,500 member companies.    Vance Shaffer, director of employment and employee relations for National Data Corp., an Atlanta-based data processing concern, called the decision a &quot;good ruling,&quot; but said he didn't expect it to have a major impact on businesses. Although the ruling will give companies more flexibility in instituting such programs, he said, it isn't likely that many companies will want to start affirmative action programs for women just because of the Supreme Court decision.    At Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., Earlene Belton-Willis, corporate employee relations manager, said the ruling will increase women's willingness to demand promotions and raises. &quot;I would think more women would come forward with the strength of the Supreme Court ruling behind them.&quot; She said she also expects an increase in sex-discrimination suits filed by women.    At the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative Denver-based group that presented oral arguments to the Supreme Court on behalf of Paul Johnson, the California man who filed the suit, the reaction was predictably negative.    &quot;We're surprised and disappointed,&quot; said staff attorney Matthew Biscan. Mr. Biscan said the conservative foundation was surprised by the 6-3 margin. &quot;Personally, I had expected a win. The feeling around the office was that it would at least be close.&quot;    Mr. Biscan said he had talked with Mr. Johnson by telephone after the ruling. &quot;The impression I got was that he felt betrayed, let down, that this wasn't the American way,&quot; Mr. Biscan said. He added: &quot;It does seem awfully unjust to me that someone's statistics could cost this man a promotion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
