 K martauthorizes credit, Toyota services Lexus cars and Jones counsels investors.andM;With their feet on the ground and heads in the sky, many companies now areturning to very small aperture  (VSAT) satellites as an attractivealternative to terrestrial data communication.andP;  VSAT networks can provideusers with higher reliability, lower costs and the opportunity to own andmanage their networks.andP;  Perhaps as a sign of the times, many enterprises areusing these benefits to refine operations, improve customer service andsecure competitive market advantages.andM;&quot;Our motto within the technology area at K mart is  Systems in Support ofService,' &quot; says David Carlson, senior vice president of corporateinformation systems at the Troy, Mich.-based retailer.andP;  &quot;Mr.andP;  [Joseph]Antonini, our chairman of the board since 1987, is absolutely passionate on Kmart becoming America's preferred retailer through superior customer service.andO;My role is to make sure that the technology we consider, develop andimplement is directly tied to this vision of customer service.andP;  In oursatellite network, it's a very easy connection.&quot;andM;K mart is far from alone in having made the connection; an increasing numberof enter rises are using VSAT.andP;  And while many of these users have reducedtheir communication expenses, perhaps few will find the cost justification ascompelling as Carlson did.andM;Lowering Costs and RisksandM;&quot;The essential justification for VSAT comes from on-line creditauthorization,&quot; says Carlson.andP;  The satellite puts K mart on line with itscredit card providers, which can then look at a customer's live creditrecord, checking for up-to-date balances and viable payment history.andP;  Thismore extensive accessibility, compared with the batch-mode processing methodsavailable before the satellite, lowers the risk of nonpayment for credit cardcompanies.andM;In other words, says Carlson, &quot;when we do $100 worth of credit sales and weturn those credit vouchers over to MasterCard or Visa, we get something lessthan $100 back, and that's called the discount.andP;  Prior to the satellite, wehad a higher discount rate than after the satellite.&quot; And the savings aresignificant.andP;  &quot;The lower discount rate on our credit volume pays for thesatellite network,&quot; Carlson explains.andM;Having on-line credit authorization also makes the VSAT network a tool fordelivering superior service.andP;  &quot;Clearly, credit authorization in three secondsversus the half minute or minute that used to occur is a customer serviceissue.andP;  And the fact that we are now very efficiently pulling backinformation on what is actually sold in every store every day makes us bettermerchants,&quot; says Carlson.andM;The network that is accomplishing all of this consists of a $3 millioncentral hub in Troy and satellite transceivers at nearly 2,200 K mart storesthroughout the United States.andP;  K mart leases satellite transponder servicesfrom Stamford, Conn.-based GTE Spacenet to provide seven-day-a-week, on-linecredit authorization, as well as off-hour batch-polling support for thecompany's set of software applications, the K mart Information Network (KIN).andO;KIN uses 56 kilobits per second (Kbps) X.25 packet switching to connect eachstore's IBM series I minicomputer with headquarters.andM;&quot;In 1986, we were doing five [thousand] to six thousand batch phone callsevery night.andP;  Now, those are on satellite, so none of those costs areincurred,&quot; adds Carlson.andP;  &quot;Every night, we pick up sales for the previous dayfrom each store.andP;  We retrieve their previous day's deposits.andP;  We also pick upa list of all credit card purchases.andP;  The on-line credit gives usauthorization, but it isn't until we process the charge that we get themoney,&quot; says Carlson.andM;&quot;Each store runs its payroll system locally, under KIN on the series 1, butsends updates to our central employee records.andP;  We send information to andfrom each store's pharmacy system on new drugs, new programs and so on.andP;  Anypurchasing, store-to-store transfers or returns are also sent via thisroute,&quot; Carlson says.andM;Early on, the network's ability to support the wide range of K martapplications was a concern.andP;  But that concern gave way to confidence, saysCarlson.andP;  &quot;Every once in a while, a technology not only gives you some goodthings it gives you some great things.andP;  And we chose VSAT in part because theX.25 support provided absolute transparency for all our applications.andP;  It isa virtual transparent pipe.andP;  Our store applications, which used to be bisync,still connect to the PAD [packet assembler and disassembler] as they alwaysdid.andP;  So literally, we have not had to change any software on either end.andO;The satellite network is transparent to all of our application software.andM;VideophilesandM;The satellite network is also used for one-way video broadcasts from the Troyheadquarters to all of the stores on the satellite network.andP;  K mart usesthose video broadcasts for merchandising, promotion and training purposes.andO;However, the greatest value of the broadcasts is in spreading K mart'sculture, allowing store employees to see, hear and get to know seniormanagement.andP;  &quot;A huge number of store employees have never seen our seniorofficers,&quot; Carlson explains.andP;  &quot;These employees don't know what managementlooks like.andP;  They don't know how they act.andP;  They don't know how they think.andO;And in today's world, a work force of 350,000 needs to be a part of thebroader scheme of what the overall organization is all about.&quot;andM;Including the individual workers in the broader scheme of things has a directeffect on customer service.andP;  &quot;The better our people feel about working with Kmart and for K mart, the better job they do with customers,&quot; Carlsonobserves.andP;  &quot;There are a million moments of truth every day where theemployees come in contact with the customers.andP;  We feel that the communicationthe video network provides gives us a better chance at some superior momentsof truth.&quot;andM;Getting Some SatisfactionandM;Getting superior customer service is the common element between themerchandising at K mart and at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.andP;  Inc.'s new Lexusdivision in Torrance, Calif.andM;Richard Sittel, manager of advanced communications, describes how theorganization's service goals drove its network requirements.andP;  &quot;We've made amajor commitment internally, both on the Toyota and the Lexus sides, toenhance customer satisfaction.andP;  And the applications that were developed forLexus, like the national service history and customer data bank, support thatoverall objective of a highly satisfied customer.andP;  &quot; The service and customerhistory applications provide each Lexus dealer with real-time, on-line accessto vehicle maintenance records and owner information.andM;&quot;It was very definitely the Lexus dealer application requirements that pushedus to consider VSAT in the first place,&quot; Sittel says.andP;  From a processorresponse point of view, we had to have dedicated communications.andP;  And toaccomplish the customer satisfaction objective, the communications would haveto be dedicated, interactive and 24 hours a day.&quot;andM;The Toyota VSAT network already supports 150 remote sites and could grow10-fold over the next five years to 1,500 sites.andP;  Steve Erickson, dealerinformation systems manager, describes the functions supported by thenetwork: &quot;Those communications provide two-way interactive datacommunications and one-way video communications to the Lexus dealer body.andP;  Wealso have data and video communications with our area offices for Lexus, withour regional offices for Toyota, with our branch offices for Toyota MotorCredit Corp., with our ports, our parts depots and public relation officesaround the country.&quot;andM;Communication from the network hub to the remote locations is over a 512Kbpstime  division  multiplexed  access outroute.andP;  Data from the remote sites istransmitted to the satellite at 9.6Kbps synchronous.andP;  &quot;The satellite networksystem multiplexes hundreds of sites into 128 kilobits [per second] of datacoming in,&quot; explains Sittel.andP;  &quot;The inroute has some contention because it'svery bursty traffic.andP;  There is no contention on the outroute.&quot; Lexuscontracts with Hughes Communications Inc. of Los Angeles for its satellitetransponder services.andM;Examining the requirements of the Lexus network led to the VSAT decision,says Sittel.andP;  &quot;We had a need for video communications that would be verydifficult to do on a terrestrial network.andP;  So, we looked at a terrestrialnetwork combined with a separate video network and those costs.andP;  And then welooked at the management costs of a T1 backbone-based network withessentially 1,000 tail circuits, which didn't make a lot of sense from amanagement standpoint.andP;  Last, we looked at the current on-line network andtraded those costs off against the VSAT costs per site.andP;  And we came to theconclusion that, for combined applications of video and data, the best thingwe could do was to go with a VSAT-based satellite network.andM;&quot;The more we got into it, the more benefits we saw,&quot; Sittel continues.andP;  &quot;Anexample is the analogy of video broadcasts: one to many.andP;  Apply that on thedata side for application code distribution or image file distribution, andcontrast that with the one-to-one environment.andP;  We can broadcast data acrossour network; it's a much more efficient delivery mechanism.&quot;andM;Broadcasting data is particularly useful for sending files like those foundin Lexus dealers' electronics parts catalog and electronic serviceinformation system.andP;  &quot; Illustrations and data are stored on CDs and areprocessed by a Pc,&quot; says Erickson.andP;  &quot;The primary data distribution is doneperiodically on the CD.andP;  Dynamic updates are supplied from the network on aone-to-many broadcast basis, where all the dealers pick it up at the sametime.&quot;andM;Data broadcasting was not the only unexpected benefit  Erickson  found.andO;&quot;Video is playing a much greater role and moving much faster than weanticipated.andP;  Video sales meetings between corborate offices and regionaloffices occur on a regular basis, in some cases taking the place of trips orof bringing regional managers in from the field.andP;  We have weekly parts andservices broadcasts to the Lexus area offices, again eliminating a lot oftravel requirements.andP;  We have also conducted training sessions.andP;  Compare thiswith cutting a tape and sending it out and answering questions over thetelephone.&quot;andM;The bottom line for the Lexus network was to provide superior customerservices for the Lexus owner, concludes Erickson.andP;  &quot;We recently had a videobroadcast to dealers announcing programs for selected Lexus models.andP;  Our VSATnetwork gives us the opportunity to make sure that our dealers get advanceinformation so they are in a position to support the customer before thecustomer's got the questions to ask.&quot;andM;VSATing PrettyandM;Promptly answering a customer's questions is just one aspect of the servicestrategy that has set brokerage firm Edward D. jones andamp; Co. apart from others.andO;jones, a St. Louis-based firm with offices in 44 states, has 1,597branches-each located in a small town or a community near a major city.andO;Founded in 1921, the firm's business has grown steadily, in part by offeringonly conservative investment opportunities and by having brokers work face toface with customers.andP;  jones now has more retail branch offices than any otherU.S.andP;  brokerage house.andM;Rich Malone, a partner and director of MIS, describes the role of jones' VSATnetwork in supporting this service strategy.andP;  &quot;The way our company isstructured, the investment representative is our only profit center.andP;  OurVSAT network is how they enter their orders and get information for theircustomer or about their customer.andP;  The network also allows them to generatedocuments customers need to sign for their investments.andM;On an average day, we will do 2.6 to 2.8 million CICS [customer informationcontrol system] transactions over that network.andP;  In essence, we run ourbusiness over that network.&quot; Unlike many brokerage businesses, a jones branchis staffed with only one broker and one support person, Malone explains.andO;From a computing standpoint, with two-person offices we have more of acentralized environment.andP;  At the branches, we have two dumb terminals and adesktop laser printer.andP;  Those are connected at 9.6Kbps to our mainframes inSt. Louis, and through SNA [Systems Network Architecture] gateways to themainframes and our 1,000-terminal Ethernet-based VAX cluster.andP;  Each branchalso has a VCR and a monitor and what's called an IRD-integrated receiver anddecoder.andP;  With this configuration, we are able to do full two-way data andone-way full motion video.&quot; Like Lexus, jones contracts its satellitetransponder services from Hughes Communications.andM;Keeping Costs Down to EarthandM;As with both K mart and Lexus, costs were an important part of the Jonesdecision to go with VSAT.andP;  &quot;We were looking for a way to somehow get a handleon our costs-because on our terrestrial network, cost was doing nothing butgoing up each year.andP;  When you're running a network such as ours, where youonly have one productive unit in each location, cost of technology is veryimportant.andP;  On a terrestrial arrangement, it's sort of like renting anapartment.andP;  You just pay and pay and pay every month.andP;  At the end of allthose payments, you don't own anything.andP;  In this case, we own our network, weown our facilities, and we control our costs now.andM;Costs went down, but one thing didn't change at all when jones switched fromterrestrial to satellite operations: the application software.andP;  N* certainlyhad to make changes to our communication front ends and protocols toaccommodate what we were doing.andP;  But we made no changes to the applications,literally none.andM;In addition to application transparency, the VSAT network also offers jonesbetter reliability, improved responsiveness and something more.andP;  &quot;We weremost concerned that the VSAT operate more reliably than our terrestrialnetwork, and we've achieved that.andP;  There are fewer points of failure in thisnetwork, and our branches are enjoying higher reliability.andP;  Our response timeis equal or better than it was on the terrestrial network,&quot; Malone observes.andO;&quot;And then, of course, you can add the video capability for little additionalcost.andP;  Video is certainly a bonus.&quot;andM;Like K mart and Lexus, jones uses its video network for training and otherinhouse purposes.andP;  But the jones network also supports customerpresentations.andM;For example, we did an international broadcast several weeks ago where wetook a feed out of Geneva and a feed out of Los Angeles and then also had oneout of our own studio and ut the three together to do a live broadcast on anew mutual fund offering we were doing.&quot;andM;For jones, K mart and Lexus, video broadcast capability has turned out to bea considerably larger asset than anticipated.andP;  And all three companies' VSATnetworks have cut costs.andP;  For each, it's been hard to identify a downside.andO;When asked if their satellite networks had provided any seriously unpleasantsurprises Erickson at Lexus' voiced an opinion echoed by the managers at theother two firms:  Reilability and maintainability exceeded all ourexpectations.andP;  The big surprise was how maintenance-free the network hasbeen.&quot;andM;Scott Wallace is a technology analyst and former executive in the computerindustry.andP;  He is a member of the QWERTY Group of technical journalists basedin Warwick, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
