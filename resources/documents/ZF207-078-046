 But before we summarizeour findings, let's pause to reflect on why database server technology isimportant.andM;PC DBMSs in transitionandM;Remember the late '70s and early '80s, when we discovered that PCs runningprograms like pfs:File, dBASE, and R:BASE provided good solutions to many ofour simple information processing requirements?andP;  We discovered that weactually enjoyed interacting with our PCs.andP;  And we began to wonder if wecouldn't move some of our transaction processing systems, which typically ranon minis and mainframes, onto our PCs.andM;Local area networks (LANs), initially invented to let us share expensiveperipherals, evolved so that we could share files, and many PC databasemanagement system (DBMS) products became available in network versions.andO;However, we soon discovered that DBMS LAN-packs, based on the file servermodel, weren't powerful enough to replace, say, a minicomputer-basedtransaction processing system.andP;  Why not?andP;  Understanding the answer to thisquestion is fundamental to understanding database servers.andM;Today's multiuser PC-DBMSs are generally set up so that the actual databaseresides on what's called a &quot;file server.&quot;andP;  (The term &quot;file server&quot; can beconfusing, because sometimes it refers to a machine, sometimes to softwarerunning on that machine, and sometimes to the combination.andP;  File serversoftware is responsible for providing access to the database.)andP;  Copies of theDBMS are installed on the individual workstations, where the actualprocessing occurs.andP;  The file server is usually a 286 or 386 system, and it'sgenerally &quot;dedicated,&quot; meaning that the 286 or 386 machine is not being usedconcurrently as a workstation.andM;Think about the hardware of this model.andP;  We're going to be hard pressed topit even a 25 MHz 386 file server with its 40M hard disk against aminicomputer.andP;  Sure, we may be able to use optical storage devices to mimicthe massive storage of a mini.andP;  But, on an active network, we're inevitablygoing to run into some real performance problems.andP;  And, sooner or later,we're going to have to confront more fundamental problems dealing withdatabase security and integrity.andM;Performance is a problem not so much because today's 386s lack the requiredhorsepower, but because today's file servers use an &quot;all or nothing&quot; approachto workstation requests.andP;  Entire copies of database files are constantlymoving back and forth along the LAN.andP;  Security and integrity are problemssimply because file servers weren't designed with the data integrity, crashrecovery, implicit concurrency, and central data management controlstypically offered by minicomputer and mainframe DBMSs.andM;We thought life was complicated when we had to graduate from single userPC-DBMSs to LAN versions of DBMSs.andP;  Now we have to tackle server-based DBMSs.andM;Where database servers fit inandM;Client Server Architecture (CSA) replaces the file server model with a morepowerful one--that of clients and servers.andP;  It promises to combine thebenefits of single user computer systems (high interactivity friendlyinterface, and low cost) with those of larger systems (data integrity,concurrency, and security).andM;Divide to conquerandM;Most of us would define a DBMS as a &quot;collection of programs that allow us tocreate and maintain a database,&quot; but to understand database servers, it'suseful to think about DBMSs from a functional point of view.andM;Functionally, a DBMS consists of three parts: the tools, a language, and anengine.andP;  Tools refer to the user interface, the front end of the DBMSs weuse.andP;  They may include an SQL query processor and/or fill-in-the-blank QBE(Query By Example).andP;  The language refers to the procedural and non-proceduralcommands supported by the DBMS.andP;  The engine is everything else and primarilyresponsible for what we normally think of as database processing.andP;  The terms&quot;engine,&quot; &quot;server,&quot; and &quot;back end&quot; are basically synonyms.andM;The basic idea is to locate servers on powerful machines and keep theapplication and language portions of the DBMS on client machines--the frontends.andP;  The database server model uses both the database server's processingpower and the individual PC's (or other clients') processing power.andP;  Bysplitting database operations, CSA harnesses the strengths of each systemcomponent.andP;  Clients, running their front-end programs like database serverversions of dBASE, R:BASE, or Lotus/DBMS, will get the benefits of familiarfeatures like report writers, application generators, context-sensitive help,and so on.andP;  The database server, or back end, maintains the database and isresponsible for security and integrity, and I/O--the client's access to thedatabase.andM;Database I/O is based on logical units of the database, rather than physicalunits of it.andP;  This means that instead of sending clients entire copies ofdatabase files, the server will send only the portions that are logicallyneeded, cutting down on LAN traffic.andP;  Database servers don't have to use SQL.andO;Most of the database servers being developed today do because SQL is aconvenient language for specifying the logical subsets of a database.andM;Under CSA then, the user interface, displays, and inquiries are kept separatefrom actual data management and filtering chores.andP;  Front-end applicationsfocus more on presenting information to the client.andP;  The server will processrequests from applications, select the necessary data, send it to the clientsover the network, and perform updates.andM;The major playersandM;I've chosen seven major server products to analyze:andM;* Ashton-Tate/Microsoft's SQL ServerandM;* IBM's OS/2 Extended EditionandM;* Gupta's SQLBase ServerandM;* XDB Systems' XDB LAN ServerandM;* Novell's NetWare SQLandM;* Oracle Corp.'s Oracle ServerandM;* Migent's Emerald BayandM;Five of these are currently available (SQL Server and OS/2 Extended Editionwith server are near release).andP;  Four--SQLBase Server, XDB LAN Server, OracleServer, and Migent's Emerald Bay--can run in a DOS environment.andP;  Their pricesstart at $595 (NetWare SQL and Emerald Bay).andP;  They offer differentApplication Program Interfaces (APIs); some are included with the server,some cost extra.andP;  (APIs are the tools that allow programmers to write codethat accesses the server and database).andP;  Some already have the softwarecommunications links available to allow their servers to interact with miniand mainframe databases.andP;  They have varying line-ups of applications thatwill run in client mode on a server-based system.andM;You'll have to look long and hard at your needs in order to decide whichsystem is best for you.andM;The Ashton-Tate/MicrosoftandM;SQL ServerandM;SQL Server should be nearing delivery as you read this.andP;  It's based ontechnology developed by Sybase, Inc., a Berkeley firm whose relational DBMSsrun on minicomputers.andP;  Sybase's engine uses a superset of ANSI SQL calledTRANSACT-SQL and enforces database integrity via triggers and rules.andP;  SQLServer, coming from industry heavyweights Microsoft and Ashton-Tate (SQLServer probably has more name recognition than any database server), deservesserious attention.andP;  Developers will be impressed with the DB-Library API setof C subroutines and the include files that can be used in applicationsrunning under DOS, Windows, or OS/2.andM;Knox Richardson, Senior Public Relations Manager for Ashton-Tate, cites threereasons he thinks SQL Server will be worth the wait.andP;  If performance is yourmajor concern, he says, &quot;SQL Server will give you the highestperformance--the highest transaction throughput of any server.&quot;andP;  The Sybaseengine, as well as having a proven track record, features re-usable storedprocedures (some server architectures require precompiling) and databaseintegrity enforced by triggers.andP;  SQL Server can also be distinguished fromthe pack based on the multiple front ends that promise to be available forit.andP;  This will allow users to &quot;leverage existing applications and data intothe groupware environment&quot; without starting from scratch.andP;  Finally, for userswith an eye on the bottom line, Knox sees SQL Server as the best investment.andO;&quot;Vendors such as Ashton-Tate guarantee that it will never be obsolete,&quot; hesays.andM;Gupta's SQLBase ServerandM;Gupta Technologies is already marketing both DOS and OS/2 versions ofSQLBase, its SQL database server, and is aggressively developing powerfulfront-end tools for a variety of platforms.andP;  The DOS version supportsextended memory.andP;  Gupta has also formed a strategic alliance with Lotus, inwhich Gupta will supply the core technology for the upcoming Lotus/DBMSdatabase server.andM;When I asked Rodney Zimmerman, Product Marketing Manager, why users shouldchoose SQLBase, he cited six reasons:andM;1.andP;  SQLBase can currently run either in a DOS or OS/2 environment.andM;2.andP;  Gupta has a solid two-year track record with database server technology.andM;3.andP;  The SQL Base server provides connectivity to IBM's DB2.andM;4.andP;  Gupta has a commitment to expand its existing multiple server SQL networkconnectivity solutions.andM;5.andP;  Gupta provides high quality Windows and Presentation Manager tools.andM;6.andP;  The company will run benchmarks during the year proving they havetransaction processing performance second to none.andM;IBM'S OS/2 Extended EditionandM;IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition marks the great parting of ways of Microsoft andIBM.andP;  Until now, the DOS sold by each company has basically been the same.andO;With IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition, however, IBM is laying the foundation forits much-heralded Systems Applications Architecture (SAA).andP;  SAA is a set ofguidelines that will enforce a common user interface (CUA) across IBM'sentire line of hardware.andM;OS/2 Extended Edition 1.0 includes a DB2-like Database Manager--but one thatcan only be used in single-user mode.andP;  LAN workstation support will beincluded in OS/2 EE 1.1.andP;  OS/2 EE Database Manager is the server you shouldwait for if you're an IBM shop and need connectivity across a range of IBMplatforms.andM;XDB Systems' XDB LANandM;ServerandM;XDB Systems currently offers XDB LAN Server, one of the few that will run ona DOS machine with a mere 640K RAM.andP;  Says XDB President Dr. S. Bing Yao, &quot;Ourserver is the fastest...It's flexible&quot; (i.e.andP;  it can run under DOS and runapplications from client systems' extended memory).andP;  Dr. Yao adds that XDB isalso &quot;the most DB2 compatible,&quot; for ensuring IBM mainframe compatibility.andO;&quot;And our engine only uses 270K.&quot;andM;Developers will appreciate the fact that XDB LAN Server doesn't require afile server, just NetBIOS.andP;  Multiuser applications can be developed andtested with relatively little hardware investment (using Novell's ELS, forexample), with a two-640K system set-up.andP;  Another interesting point wegleaned from our phone interview with Yao relates to XDB's strategy forporting XDB to OS/2 Presentation Manager and the Macintosh.andP;  Rather thantreat each port separately, XDB will rewrite the XDB screens in a high levellanguage and then write specific graphical drivers for the high levellanguage.andM;Novell's NetWare SQLandM;Stephen Hochschild, Manager of Product Marketing for Novell's DevelopmentProducts Division, thinks Novell's installed base of NetWare users givesNetWare SQL an inside track in the database server market.andP;  He also points tothe large base of existing programs that use Btrieve, a key-indexed recordmanagement tool that's bundled with all NetWare products.andP;  Hochschild saysthat Novell's NetWare SQL database server differentiates itself from thecompetition based on three factors: price; the fact that it resides in thefile server alongside NetWare (users can install both the file server anddatabase server software on the same PC); and its tight integration.andM;Steve says Novell isn't really trying to make money on NetWare SQL--it's inthe business of selling NetWare.andP;  &quot;Novell isn't making a living sellingNetWare SQL, People are looking at it like a utility.andP;  They buy it because itwill make their programs run better.andP;  We have the host level NetWare, ourengine based on Btrieve, and the NetWare SQL engine all in the same box.&quot;andP;  Healso reminds us that Novell's API has a proven track record: &quot;Our XQL producthas been shipping for over a year and a half.andP;  It's stable.andP;  We've sold many,many copies.andP;  All we've done with NetWare SQL is move that product to thefile server as an engine as a value added process.&quot;andM;ORACLE Corp.'s Oracle ServerandM;Oracle has solved many connectivity problems by providing versions of Oracleto run on a wide variety of systems and has recently appealed to dBASEdevelopers by introducing special Oracle versions of WordTech's dBXL (a dBASEclone) and Quicksilver (a dBASE compiler).andP;  Oracle's Gene Shklar points tothree main areas where Oracle's server solutions distinguish it from thecompetition: support for distributed databases, in-place support of multipleprotocols, and existing workgroup computing capability.andM;&quot;Oracle supports distributed databases,&quot; say Shklar.andP;  That sounds fairlyinnocuous, but what it means is that a single database can reside partiallyon a hard disk on an OS/2 server, for example, and partially on another OS/2server, or on a VAX.andP;  Shklar predicts that 386 PC server users will run intothis problem (they don't have the relatively easy solution a VAX user has ofcalling the vendor for a larger VAX, for example).andP;  Another way ofunderstanding what the idea of distributed databases means is to realize that&quot;with Oracle, with a single SQL statement, you can refer to data that resideson multiple servers.&quot;andP;  In a similar vein, Oracle is Oracle across all itssupported platforms: &quot;If you write an application to the server, yourapplication will automatically work on all versions of Oracle.andM;From the server chart, you'll see confirmation of his second point aboutOracle support for multiple protocols.andM;Migent's Emerald BayandM;Emerald Bay, the server from Wayne Ratliff and Migent, has several thingsgoing for it: its low cost, its ability to run in a 640K DOS environment, andits support for variable length and binary fields (the latter permits imagestorage).andM;Chris Hahn, Migent's Director of Cooperative Alliances, describes himself asa &quot;full-time person who makes deals with vendors.&quot;andP;  When asked why peopleshould consider Emerald Bay, he said, &quot;We do common things better--asexemplified by our Eagle database programming language.andP;  We also do thingsthat others can't do in a 640K DOS environment.andP;  For one thing, we have aserver that works in that environment.andP;  Furthermore, our engine allowsdiverse applications (word processing, accounting, and spreadsheet) to sharethe same data real-time.&quot;andP;  Hahn says that programmers can use the CDeveloper's Toolkit and modify existing commercial programs to use theEmerald Bay engine, often in less than a week.andP;  Others are modifying theirown applications to run as clients.andP;  Some of them are finding how easy it isto intermingle Eagle, C, and even assembler to achieve optimum networkperformance.andM;Potential users should note that Emerald Bay only requires 120K RAM for thefull developer engine and 58K for workstation nodes.andM;SummaryandM;Database server technology is still in its infancy.andP;  Several of the productsdiscussed aren't even being sold yet, so it's impossible to compareperformance.andP;  There may be a market shakeout, with one or two dominantservers emerging.andP;  This may mean that vendors selling front ends will provideversions of their software to work only with industry leaders.andP;  On the otherhand, some unknown black sheep may arise as the server standard.andP;  Mostlikely, however, multiple server solutions, some more specialized and/orproprietary than others, will co-exist.andM;Still, if you want to get in on the leading edge of server technology, thereare some fairly obvious questions to ask yourself:andM;* What operating system do you plan to use?andM;* What LAN do you have?andM;* Will the applications you want to use with your database work with theserver?andM;* Do you need an API?andM;* What are the hardware requirements for the server and workstations?andM;* How much money do you want to spend on the server software?andM;* What do you think of the long-term strategy of the company whose server youare considering?andP;  Do you have confidence the company will deliver?andM;Tough questions.andM;Karen Watterson is the Program Coordinator of Shoreline Community College'sBusiness Computer Program in Seattle.andP;  She is co-author of &quot;UnderstandingR:BASE&quot;
