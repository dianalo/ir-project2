This is done by writing the governing cluster balanceequations in differential form and expressing the solution as a perturbationseries in terms of the aerosol surface area. It is found that scavenginghas an increasingly important effect on the nucleation rate as the vapor-phasesupersaturation ratio decreases or the cluster surface energy increases.</TEXT></DOC>
