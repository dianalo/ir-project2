Outside, the city was changing.    After 25 years of immigration, Miami was electing a Cuban-born mayor. The Herald editors tuned to Channel 23, a Spanish station that was the first to project a winner, but they didn't understand it.    &quot;We were catching bits and phrases,&quot; says Doug Clifton, a deputy managing editor. Finally, he summoned a translator.    Secure in glass cages, as their offices are called, the editors had lost touch not only with the election but also with the city itself. With Miami becoming more and more Latin, the newspaper that lorded over it was becoming increasingly remote. The numbers told the story: In 1960, 79% of the households in Dade County got the Herald. By 1985, the figure had dropped to 40%. &quot;We have, against our best intentions, created a Fort Herald,&quot; John Schueler, vice president of circulation, wrote in a memo to publisher Richard Capen last year.    In recent months, the Herald has begun trying to change that. In hopes of winning Hispanic readers, it is trying to Latinize its content, staff and marketing.    Many newspapers have trouble making readers out of immigrants, but Miami's Cubans pose a unique challenge. They have achieved economic and political power without, it seems, paying the customary price of assimilation.    Thus, the Herald's efforts suggest the problem facing much of Anglo Miami these days, as the old white power structure gives way to a new Hispanic one. And the jury is out on whether the 76-year-old newspaper -- the epitome of Miami's old guard -- will succeed.    &quot;I don't believe that any superficial approach is going to work,&quot; says Mercedes Sandoval, a Cuban-born anthropologist in Miami. &quot;Cuban culture is more than a cup of strong coffee. And Cubans perceive that the Herald is not sympathetic to them.&quot;    So far, the changes have been modest. The paper hired Angel Castillo, a lawyer and former reporter, as associate managing editor for news. It also is stressing Cuban coverage in its news columns, its hiring and its promotions.    However, the change in emphasis has alienated many among the Herald's still overwhelmingly Anglo staff, leading some to think about working elsewhere. And the Herald risks alienating Anglo readers.    Many Anglos already have fled Miami, and Latins are now the biggest ethnic group in Dade County, representing 43% of the population. Anglo whites account for 37% and blacks 19%.    What's more, Dade's Latins have created a largely self-sufficient economy. There are 30 Latin-owned banks, 1,500 Latin lawyers and eight Spanish radio stations. And although the younger generation speaks English, fresh waves of immigrants have replenished the pool of Spanish speakers. Thus, 28 years after the Cuban Revolution, nearly half the Latins in Dade rely mainly on Spanish, according to Herald research. And, according to a study by Strategy Research Corp., a consultant in Miami, the use of Spanish at home and at work is greater now than in 1975 and in 1980.    Mr. Castillo calls this &quot;reverse assimilation.&quot; Mr. Schueler, the paper's circulation chief, says &quot;I don't know of any paper in the country that has as complex a marketing problem as we do.&quot;    The open sore between the Herald and Miami's Latins involves politics. In editorials and news stories, the paper takes a middle-of-the-road approach to international affairs. But Miami's Cubans and Nicaraguans, who are aggressively anti-Communist, accuse the paper of being insensitive to their ideas. Some Latin radio commentators refer to the Herald as &quot;Miami Pravda.&quot; Mr. Capen, the publisher, calls the charges &quot;really unfair.&quot;    The source of disaffection, though, may be deeper than ideology. Raul Masvidal, a banker and Bay of Pigs veteran, says the Herald hasn't grasped that Cubans think of themselves as political exiles bent on preserving their culture for a possible return, rather than immigrants seeking better lives.    &quot;They thought the Cubans would become normal readers,&quot; he says, &quot;just like people who came here from Detroit or Minnesota.&quot;    Larry Jinks, senior vice president of Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Herald, says the paper's initial strategy was based on a belief in &quot;the inevitable process of assimilation.&quot;    When assimilation didn't turn out to be so inevitable, the Herald began to experiment. In the 1960s, it printed a column, and later a page, of news in Spanish. In 1976, it added El Herald, a Spanish section, in the form of a mini-newspaper, distributed with the Herald on request.    El Herald was conceived of as a &quot;transitional&quot; paper that would accustom Cubans to reading the English paper, says Mr. Jinks, the Herald's executive editor at the time.    However, El Herald hasn't developed a strong, separate identity. In the early 1980s, Knight-Ridder, one of the most prominent corporations in Miami, considered and rejected a proposal to significantly expand the Spanish section. Instead, the company, which has no Hispanics among its directors or officers, chose its own version of white flight.    The paper launched major expansions in Palm Beach County and on the Treasure Coast, 100 miles north of Dade. &quot;We had certain research that said that half of the Hispanics didn't read any newspaper,&quot; says Heath Meriwether, the executive editor, who has announced that, for family reasons, he is resigning from the paper in May. &quot;Palm Beach looked a lot more like standard Herald demographics.&quot;    The Herald spent a lot of money but won only minor gains in circulation. The main result was prompting suburban competitors to improve their own papers. Last year, the Treasure Coast section was killed, and the Herald scaled back its goals for Palm Beach. It also is losing ground to the competition in neighboring Fort Lauderdale.    Total circulation, at 407,000, is barely above the level of a decade ago. Profit, at roughly $55 million, has been flat in the 1980s, and there is little advertising from Hispanics.    That leaves the Herald with one place to grow. &quot;Over the years, this newspaper hasn't had a strong readership among Hispanics,&quot; says Mr. Capen, a former public-affairs man in the Defense Department who has learned Spanish and led a public-relations push since becoming publisher in 1983. &quot;We must be relevant to our home county.&quot;    But to a Cuban reader, the Herald screams out that it is staffed by Anglos. Spanish words are misspelled. There is scant coverage of Miami's two Spanish television stations or of its Latin theater.    Last December, a 1987 calendar of events in the Herald's Sunday magazine listed Cuban Independence Day as Oct. 10. It actually is May 20.    In 1985, the Herald told readers where to find the best hamburgers, pasta, ribs, oysters, American coffee and a dozen other treats. But no arroz con pollo.    And last March, the Herald reported that a Latin street fair was pulsating with &quot;samba,&quot; or Brazilian music. &quot;We had salsa, merengue, every kind of tropical music,&quot; says Leslie Pantin, one of the fair's organizers. &quot;We didn't have samba.&quot;    The battle between the Herald and the Cuban community reached a fever pitch last spring, when pressure from right-wing Cubans led to the cancellation of a play by Dolores Prida, a Cuban living in New York. The play was nonpolitical, but Ms. Prida was unpopular among Miami's Cubans for having supported political contact between the U.S. and Cuban President Fidel Castro.    The Herald strongly criticized the Cuban extremists. Columnist Carl Hiaasen called them &quot;drooling zealots.&quot;    The response of some Spanish-language radio stations was so heated and so personal that the Herald asked Mr. Castillo, then a lawyer in private practice, to consider a libel suit. Mr. Castillo recommended against it. But he returned a 62-page memo with a biting attack on Mr. Hiaasen and the Herald in general.    The paper, 40-year-old Mr. Castillo said, covered the dispute in a vacuum -- with no understanding of the rich cultural life in Cuban Miami. Chief among his recommendations was to hire a high-ranking Cuban editor.    Shortly after receiving the memo, Mr. Meriwether told Mr. Hiaasen that his adjectives were too &quot;superheated,&quot; Mr. Meriwether recalls. But Mr. Hiaasen, a prize-winning writer whose tone is similarly harsh on other subjects, says, &quot;I'd write it the same way next time.&quot;    After the Prida affair, the Herald asked 19 prominent Cubans to critique the paper. Lawyer Maria Elena Prio responded that &quot;the Herald is perceived as monolithically Anglo&quot; and &quot;arrogant.&quot;    In October, taking Mr. Castillo's advice, the Herald hired a Cuban editor: Mr. Castillo. It gave more space to Latin opinion writers. It made fluency in Spanish a criterion for hiring and promoting. And the paper started including more stories concerning Cuban-Americans, such as a recent profile of a Cuban-born professor at Harvard. Although less than wholly satisfied, Miss Prio, the lawyer, says, &quot;The Herald is doing a better job.&quot;    The Herald's staff, though, is still predominantly Anglo. Of 403 editorial employees, the Herald has 46 Hispanics and a dozen or so bilingual Anglos. But about a third of the Hispanics work only for El Herald. Mr. Castillo is the only Latin among the top 20 news managers.    Anglo managers live in an Anglo world. Mr. Clifton, the deputy managing editor and a 17-year Herald veteran, says he has &quot;no genuine Cuban friends&quot; and has never had a Cuban over to dinner.    The Herald has traditionally recruited young Northeasterners, often Ivy Leaguers, who are generally more adept at finding Anglo sources than Latin ones. &quot;There is a cultural difference,&quot; one reporter explains. &quot;Some Cubans think Castro is as bad as the Nazis. The Anglo press doesn't.&quot;    Some reporters are worried about their careers. When two rookie Cuban-Americans were promoted above dozens of more experienced writers, &quot;Hispanic panic&quot; became a catch phrase in the newsroom. An Anglo reporter mockingly dubbed a new Cuban senior editor &quot;Senor Editor.&quot;    &quot;The Herald is my hometown newspaper,&quot; says Jeffrey Weiss, a reporter in Palm Beach. &quot;I'd hate to do it, but I may have to look elsewhere.&quot;    Resentment among both reporters and editors is focused on Mr. Castillo, who is viewed as an outsider.    Staffers also grouse about what some call &quot;pandering&quot; to Cuban readers. Recently, the Herald purchased $37,000 of cassettes from the Cuban American National Foundation, an anti-Castro lobbying group. The cassettes, titled &quot;I Shall Return -- But With Freedom,&quot; will be given out to new Cuban subscribers.    Angering Anglo readers is another risk. When El Herald was accidentally delivered to Anglo homes in suburban Broward County, reporter Paul Shannon says, &quot;There were tons of complaints. One caller said, 'Are we being overrun like Dade?'&quot;    Mr. Castillo, though, has moved slowly. He says his first goal is for reporters to widen their sourcing. &quot;If a story on the local hospital comes in without any Latin names,&quot; he says, &quot;the reporter probably missed a piece of the story.&quot;    He also is focusing on El Herald. With only two news reporters and a desk of translators, it lacks vitality, readers say. Mr. Castillo wants to expand the section and sell it as an independent paper. He will begin testing stand-alone sales this month.    The plan has revived the old debate within Knight-Ridder about assimilation. &quot;We can't wait another 30 years&quot; for Cuban-Americans to stop reading Spanish, says Mr. Castillo. But Knight-Ridder brass has yet to be convinced. &quot;I have strong reservations about making El Herald a stand-alone,&quot; says Mr. Jinks. &quot;If Knight-Ridder spoke in two voices, it could be viewed with cynicism.&quot;    What's more, the Herald is doing better with younger Cubans, upholding Mr. Jinks's faith in assimilation. &quot;Time,&quot; he says, &quot;is on our side.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
