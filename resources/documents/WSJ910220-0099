Mr. Lee was a potent witness at the time, with a 15-yeartrack record in the buy-out business and a string ofinvestment successes that had helped him build a personalfortune estimated at $250 million.</LP><TEXT>   Unlike most buyout specialists, who raise money from giantinstitutions, Mr. Lee from 1987 onward gave the little guy achance to invest in his deals. While such deals are risky andilliquid, the successes of the 1980s made them attractive.Thanks to the marketing clout of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. brokers,Mr. Lee raised $900 million from 40,000 Merrill customersthrough two ML/Lee limited partnerships.   Last month, however, Hills filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection from its creditors. Seven othercompanies in the Lee portfolios have stopped paying cashinterest on their debts, a sign of growing financial trouble.Investors in the ML/Lee partnerships who phone a toll-free800 number that provides portfolio updates now hear asix-minute recital of all the debt restructurings under way.   The slump in Mr. Lee's partnerships was clearly adisappointment to Merrill, which had marketed the ML/Leefunds as &quot;an extraordinary investment opportunity,&quot; a viewthat so far hasn't been borne out by the funds' performance.   A Merrill spokeswoman says the two ML/Lee funds &quot;remain aviable investment with good long-term potential.&quot; Mr. Leeconcedes in an interview: &quot;This is a difficult economicenvironment for us.&quot; But both he and Merrill say it'spremature to predict the eventual returns of the two funds,which have nine and 13 years left to run.   Mr. Lee adds that the funds' investments in companies suchas Playtex Family Products Corp. and Omega Wire Inc. have thepotential to be big winners, and that he expects that many,perhaps all, of his financially strapped holdings willeventually recover.   Other buy-out specialists say that Mr. Lee's troublesillustrate how vulnerable leveraged companies have become inthe current economic slump. &quot;Tom's a high-quality guy,&quot; saysJohn Canning, head of First Chicago Corp.'s buy-out group.&quot;But like a lot of people, he's got deals that are underfinancial stress.&quot;   The 40,000 investors in the ML/Lee Acquisition Fund andthe ML/Lee Acquisition Fund II must be hoping that Mr. Leeand Merrill are right that the funds will recover. Thesefunds bought subordinated debt that helped finance Mr. Lee'sbuyouts, as well as 13% to 50% of the equity in a typicalbuy-out. Mr. Lee's firm of Thomas H. Lee Co. and the buy-outcompany's management usually hold the rest of the equity.   When Mr. Lee raised the ML/Lee funds in 1987 and 1989, hetalked of providing investors with a return at least 7 1/2percentage points above the yield on the Merrill Lynchjunk-bond index. That would have amounted to a return ofabout 21% a year.   So far, however, the first and oldest fund has fallen farshort of that target. In its three years of existence, thefirst ML/Lee fund has provided about 10% a year in currentincome to its investors. But the value of the partnershipinterests seems to be slipping. Although the partnershipinterests aren't actively traded, Merrill Lynch arranged aseries of trades on Jan. 1 in which the interests changedhands at prices ranging from face value to a 15% discount.The second fund hasn't been around long enough to have ameaningful track record.   An immediate worry for investors in the second ML/Lee fundis Hills, a Midwestern retailer that spotlights the risks ofwhat Mr. Lee calls &quot;growth LBOs.&quot; Unlike other buy-outspecialists, Mr. Lee seldom sells major assets of thecompanies he acquires. Instead, he spurs managers to make thebusinesses expand. But when companies don't achieve theirambitious growth plans, trouble ensues.   Hills used to be the biggest subsidiary of Scoa IndustriesInc., a Columbus, Ohio, retailer run by Mr. Lee's uncle,Herbert H. Schiff. In 1985, Mr. Lee, backed by Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., arranged a $607 million buy-out of Scoa. For awhile, everything went smoothly. Scoa sold its smaller units,siphoned off cash from its overfunded pension plan andimproved returns.   In 1987, renamed Hills, the retailer went public again at$11 a share. But Mr. Lee's company and affiliates didn't sellany of the 19.4% stake they owned; they could look at a $30million paper profit on their $8 million equity investment inHills.   Hills's stock began tumbling last year, though, as retailsales weakened nationwide. Meanwhile, debt and lease paymentswere slated to rise steadily. Starting in December 1990, witha $43 million payment, Hills would have to start repayingprincipal on its debt.   Mr. Lee had hoped Hills could service its debt whileborrowing more money to expand operations. Hills built storesrapidly and took over 35 Gold Circle Stores from FederatedDepartment Stores Corp. in 1988, adding $200 million toHills's debt and lease obligations. &quot;That was the mistake,&quot;Mr. Lee says now.   Analysts say Hills's breakneck growth caused otherproblems. There wasn't enough cash to upgrade older stores,which began to look worn. Until recently, Hills maintainedoutmoded practices such as refusing credit cards. It incurredhigher costs by failing to build its own distributioncenters.   Last March, Hills sold $100 million of 15% juniorsubordinated notes to raise cash. The second ML/Lee fundbought $48.5 million of the notes; this was the first timethat the ML/Lee funds had put money in Hills. The purchase,which temporarily bolstered the value of Mr. Lee's personalequity stake in Hills, was approved by Merrill andindependent fund directors, Mr. Lee says.   By January, with Hills's Gold Circle stores faltering andthe general retail climate souring, Hills's banks demanded adebt restructuring. Mr. Lee agreed to put in more cash, butcouldn't reach agreement with the banks, precipitating theChapter 11 filing. Mr. Lee says vendors are now shippinggoods to Hills stores. He says he's working hard to revivethe chain, but can't discuss details.   &quot;If there was one systematic error&quot; in ML/Lee's problemdeals, Mr. Lee says, &quot;it was believing that management coulddo too much.&quot;   The biggest headache for investors in the first ML/Leefund is BeefAmerica Inc., a Nebraska meatpacker in which thefund invested $107 million. Half that outlay was made inSeptember 1988 as a temporary &quot;bridge&quot; loan, meant to bequickly replaced by permanent bank borrowings. But the banksbacked off as drought and small cattle herds hurtBeefAmerica's results. The bridge loan lingers on, but itisn't paying interest.   A BeefAmerica official says Mr. Lee has been conscientiousin helping the company restructure debts. But Mr. Leeconcedes the bridge loan was &quot;an error.&quot; He says the secondML/Lee fund has tighter guidelines on making bridge loans.   For all their current trouble, the ML/Lee funds areperforming in line with big insurers' portfolios of&quot;mezzanine&quot; securities, which combine subordinated debt withequity stakes, says one of Mr. Lee's partners, John Childs.Letting small investors mimic the big guys was part of theselling pitch for the ML/Lee funds in the late 1980s. Thetrouble is, as Mr. Childs acknowledges, mezzanine portfolioshaven't proven to be winners lately.   ---                Thomas Lee's Winning Touch                 Is Suffering In Recession                                                                                                                              ML/LEE FUNDS'                                                                                                        BeefAmerica Inc.    $107 million of    Bonds have `stopped                     notes $2 million   accruing interest';                     of stock           part-owner Eli                                        Jacobs says company                                        is recovering from                                        slump.
