Chairman John F.Akers expects his base pay for last year to be cut 40%, toless than $1.6 million, because IBM had its first annual lossever in 1991.   Mr. Akers gave that percentage estimate in the IBM annualreport, galleys of which became available late last week. AnIBM spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., said the pay cut may turn outto be slightly greater, but he said the amount won't be setuntil the IBM board votes on executive compensation at theend of the month.</LP><TEXT>   The spokesman said that the four other members of IBM'smanagement committee, its top group, will likewise probablysee their pay drop 40% or more. An industry executive saidthe approximately 60 other executives who carry titles ofcorporate vice president and above will see their base paydrop 10% to 20%. The IBM spokesman said that was possible,given that IBM has been increasingly tying executives' pay tothe company's performance, but he said he didn't think theissue had been resolved yet. It likewise won't be clear untilafter the board meeting whether the company will somehowsoften the pay cuts, possibly by granting stock awards oroptions that aren't counted as base pay.   The issue of executive pay is a sensitive one at mostcompanies these days. (Indeed, James Preston, chairman andchief executive officer of Avon Products Inc., on Friday saidhe has frozen his salary and lowered his bonus in exchangefor stock options.)   But the issue has been an especially touchy one at IBM forthe past year. Even though many IBM employees have foundraises hard to come by in recent years as IBM has languished,Mr. Akers and the other management committee members receivedpay increases of 33% to 43% a year ago, based on thecompany's strong 1990 earnings. The executives also receivedrestricted stock awards that were then valued at $725,000 to$2 million. Compounding the alarm among employees was thefact that the very day the pay increases were disclosed inarticles based on the company's proxy statement, the companyannounced that first-quarter earnings would be a disaster.   The annual report also provided new details on IBM'sservices business, which the company has said for some timeis growing rapidly and which it looks to as a way of reducingits reliance on computer hardware, where price wars havedeveloped. The report says that services revenue grew 35%last year, to $5.6 billion. But the report also says that thegross profit margin on services was 18.8%. That is more than30 percentage points lower than for IBM as a whole, callinginto question how much of a savior the services business willturn out to be.   In addition, the report removes the wording that in prioryears had said the company intended to maintain its prizedtriple-A credit rating. Reflecting announcements that therating agencies have turned cautious on IBM, the reportmerely says the company intends to maintain &quot;a strong capitalstructure.&quot;   &quot;That is a clear signal that the rating is notsustainable,&quot; said Steve Cohen, a securities analyst atSoundView Financial Group Inc.   Separately, industry executives said IBM has decided todelay the U.S. announcement of its entry into the notebookcomputer market, which had been set for tomorrow. The productwill be introduced in Europe as scheduled, but the U.S.unveiling has been delayed until late March. The notebook,which was expected to have an aggressive price but whichcontains hohum technology, is to become part of anannouncement of a potentially very interesting product: alaptop with a sharp color screen that can run on batteries.   Tomorrow, IBM is expected to announce machines thatreplace the middle of its personal-computer line. An IBMspokesman declined to comment, but industry executives saidthe products will use a special IBM version of the IntelCorp. 386SX chip that is more than 80% faster than thecomparable Intel version. The products will also be able touse floppy disks that hold 2.88 megabytes of data, twice thecapacity of the current standard.   But dealers said the PC market is moving to Intel chipsthat are more powerful than the 80386SX, reducing theadvantage that IBM gets from its special chip. The dealerssaid it also isn't clear whether IBM has priced the machineslow enough.   &quot;IBM really has to deliver something strong here,&quot; saidMatt Fitzsimmons, owner of a ComputerLand store in NorthWhite Plains, N.Y. &quot;They've been very successful to date inthat middle range, but their stuff is beginning to age, andcustomers are beginning to consider alternatives.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
