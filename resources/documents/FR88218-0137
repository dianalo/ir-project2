Before such authorization is given, the directors willconsider whether a need for the fund exists and will insure that adequatesafeguards and accountability will exist to protect the fund. </ITAG>Section 701.10 has been in existence unchanged since January 29, 1969.(34 FR 1398).Section 748.0 (``Security Program'') states:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Each federally-insured credit union will develop a written securityprogram within 90 days of the effective date of insurance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The security program will be designed to protect each credit unionoffice from robberies, burglaries, and larcenies; to prevent destructionof vital records as defined in the <T3>Accounting Manual for Federal Credit Unions;</T3> and to assist inthe identification of persons who commit or attempt such crimes.</ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the NCUA Board, as part of its continuing reviewof NCUA regulations, proposed to eliminate andSection; 701.10 and to add``embezzlement'' to the list of crimes against which an FCU would haveto secure. The Board explained: (a) The first sentence of andSection; 701.10was unnecessary in light of the language of section 107(12) of the FCUAct (12 U.S.C. 1757(12)) and of Article XV, Section 3, of the StandardFCU Bylaws; (b) the provisions of the second sentence more properly belongedin andSection; 748.0, relating to security precautions; and (c) with theaddition of ``embezzlement'' to the list of crimes an FCU must secure against,andSection; 748.0 would provide adequate guidance to FCU's.Three comments were received. All supported the proposal, although onesuggested more extensive changes to andSection; 748.0. The Board will considerthese when undertaking its regulatory review of that provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certifies that the amendment and repealof these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets).The action eliminates and clarifies NCUA Regulations. Accordingly, theBoard has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThe changes do not impose any additional paperwork requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 701 and 748</ITAG>Credit unions, Cash fund, Embezzlement, Security programs.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on February 10,1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, the NCUA amends its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG>1.
