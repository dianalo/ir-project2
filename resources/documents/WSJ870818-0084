The move increases the pressure on the Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern to deal with the Kaskel group, which last week disclosed a 7.9% stake in Kansas City Southern. Company officials have declined to comment on the Kaskel group's actions and have so far declined to meet with its representatives.    By seeking clearance to acquire majority control under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, the Kaskel group is developing an option it doesn't necessarily intend to pursue. A spokesman confirmed that the move doesn't mean that the investors will actually seek control.    In disclosing their stake in Kansas City Southern last week, the Kaskel companies said they were considering a number of alternatives, including a takeover attempt, seeking representation on the company's board and recommending a restructuring.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas City Southern's stock fell 37.5 cents to $78.75.    In its filing, the Kaskel group criticized Kansas City Southern's plans to bid for Southern Pacific Transportation Co., a unit of Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. While Kansas City Southern hasn't made a bid, the Kaskel group said such a move &quot;would not be in the best economic interests of the company's stockholders.&quot; It cited what it said was the unit's &quot;lack of profitability,&quot; as well as earnings dilution and additional debt for Kansas City Southern that might result from such a purchase.    Donald L. Graf, senior vice president for finance for Kansas City Southern, said the company hasn't had any contact from the Kaskel group.    Kansas City Southern has adopted several anti-takeover measures to ward off unwanted suitors, including one that would allow units of the company to be sold to its own executives at below-market prices. Mr. Graf said the various measures &quot;collectively represent a significant defense.&quot;    &quot;There's some question in my mind whether the Kaskel group has evaluated them properly, or is even knowledgeable about them,&quot; Mr. Graf said.    Separately, a group including George Soros, a New York investor, and Quantum Fund, a Netherlands Antilles-based mutual fund managed by Mr. Soros, said it lowered its stake in Kansas City Southern to 7.4% of the common shares outstanding.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it sold 145,000 Kansas City Southern shares between July 16 and Aug. 10 for $64.50 to $74.34 each. As a result of the sales, the group holds 713,000 Kansas City Southern shares.    A reason for the sale wasn't given. </TEXT></DOC>
