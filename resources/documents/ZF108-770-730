Baker III postponed theirscheduled training in using a text retrieval package.andM;Ironically, the product, Status/IQ from Computer Power Group of New York,might help the secretary's staff in times of crisis, said Dan Mcle, directorof State's IRM executive secretariat.andP;  MclIe said State chose the softwarefor its efficiency.andM;&quot;The main reasons for the selection of Status/IQ were the natural languageinquiry method and the ability for real-time indexing,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;For example, I believe our users will be more apt to use the system and tosave time with it when they can simply type in 'Iraq' and 'chemical warfare'rather than use defined terms in a more structured search environment.&quot;andM;The software gives State employees access to information stored in thedepartment's Wang Laboratories Inc. VS/10000 Model 100 mid-range computer andTempest 80386 laptops from Grid Systems Corp., Fremont, Calif., using the IQportion of the software.andP;  The laptops are equipped with 40M to 100M ofstorage, McIe said.andM;The IQ user interface lets the user type questions or individual words.andP;  IQ'sAI components peruse the database and retrieve a list of documents thatanswers the question, putting the best answer first.andM;Status automatically indexes data, which can be entered in batches or online, said Susan Parker, a spokesman for the publisher.andP;  Automatic feeds ofnew text files and optical scanning are possible, she said.andM;Eventually, State workers both in field and in the department's Washingtonheadquarters will use the software for real time indexing and retrieval oftelegram and testimony and speeches by Baker and other top State officials,using both minicomputer and PC versions of the production.andM;Until now, Baker's staff has carried paper copies of the many telegrams Bakeramassed during travel.andP;  When they need to find a certain reference in atelegrams aides lost time sorting through the paper files.andP;  McIe said.andM;&quot;Aides in his party have always carried hard copies of the telegrams toreference when needed, but it was a time-consum process to go through themall to find on two references,&quot; McIe said.andM;Parker said State bought the software $89,000.andP;  Status/IQ consists of 900,000list of Fortran and C, she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
