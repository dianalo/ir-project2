The nine-page document would be the shortest party platform inhalf a century if approved next Tuesday at the national conventionin Atlanta.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's chief platform negotiator, saidin an interview that the minority planks were left out because``we're still negotiating.'' She added that talks with MichaelDukakis campaign ``are going well.''   The 4,000-plus-word document includes all the areas of agreementreached June 25 in a meeting of the 186-member platform committeein Denver.   The Jackson forces lost votes there on such issues as his callfor higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a Pentagonfreeze, no first-use of nuclear weapons, self-determination for thePalestinians and major increases in spending on Head Start,education and other social programs.   The platform released today includes a memorandum that says,``To avoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreedthat the report on minority planks, which is still underdiscussion, will be available at the convention.''   The platform promises to ``reverse seven years of `voodooeconomics,' `trickle down' policies, fiscal irresponsibility andeconomic violence against poor and working people.''   It pledges the party to seek an indexed minimum wage, ``majorincreases'' in child care aid for low and middle-income families,advance notice of plant closings and appointment of a national drugczar. It also endorses the Equal Rights Amendment and says ``thefundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteedregardless of ability to pay.''   It promises the Democrats will fight homelessness and intensifythe war on AIDS, and it says national strength ``will be enhancedby more stable defense budgets.''   ``We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,that will promote peace and prevent war,'' it says.</TEXT></DOC>
