Secretary of State James Baker III headed a delegation of 40U.S. officials, including four Cabinet members, at talks withMexican officials Monday.   Baker was quoted as saying no friendship was more important tothe United States than that with Mexico.   The unusually large delegation followed the Bushadministration's support of Mexico in reaching an agreement withforeign creditor banks on reduction of its $107 billion foreigndebt.   ``A spirit of greater understanding toward Mexico was expressed.... There is hope that this meeting is the beginning of a newera,'' El Universal newspaper wrote.   In a front-page editorial, the daily Uno mas Uno said,``Evidently relations are on a very distinct level from the tensionthat characterized relations with the government of Ronald Reagan.''   Reagan administration officials frequently accused Mexico offailing to take sufficient action to stop drug trafficking, ofofficial corruption and of failing to support U.S. policies inCentral America.   But the left-leaning La Jornada, the newspaper most critical ofthe Mexican government and the United States, said bothadministrations were new and there hadn't been time to discovermore profound differences.   Excelsior, one of Mexico's largest newspapers, questioned thedepth of the new harmony.   ``Will all this be reality or just ... wishful thinking?'' askedcolumnist Miguel Barbarena.   He said that on Monday both sides skirted thorny issues such asCentral America and illegal Mexican aliens in the United States. Hesaid the talks produced nothing concrete in narcotics control orfinancial questions.   An editorial in the same paper said, ``The dangers persist thatbilateral relations will take a distinct turn from what isanticipated.''   In the weeks leading up to the debt settlement, Salinas tooknumerous steps to assuage Washington's major complaints. Corruptunion leaders were arrested, a drug kingpin was jailed and foreigninvestment restrictions were relaxed.</TEXT></DOC>
