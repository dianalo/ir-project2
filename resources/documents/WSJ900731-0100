Generale de Radiologie in1988, the U.S. company decided to boost the morale of its newFrench employees.   GE called a training seminar for French and other Europeanmanagers. In their hotel rooms, the company left colorfulT-shirts emblazoned with the GE slogan &quot;Go for One.&quot; A noteurged the managers to wear the T-shirts &quot;to show that you aremembers of the team.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The French wore them, grudgingly, to the seminar, but, asone of the French managers recalls: &quot;It was like Hitler wasback, forcing us to wear uniforms. It was humiliating.&quot;   GE insists it wasn't trying to force anyone to wear theshirts. &quot;It's just one of those things that Americanssometimes do at meetings,&quot; says a spokeswoman.   That gaffe was the opening round in a bitter and prolongedcultural clash at GE-CGR. The French company, formerly asedate state-owned concern that had been run much like agovernment ministry, found itself in the hands of brash,all-American, profit-hungry GE.   After two years of restructuring, massive layoffs and acontinuing flight of French managers and engineers -- thework force has shrunk to about 5,000 from 6,500 -- GE-CGR isstill posting losses. It has shuttered about half of itsdozen plants in Europe, and more closings are planned. Worse,instead of its projected $25 million profit last year, GE-CGRhad a $25 million loss and expects to lose nearly as muchthis year, say individuals close to the company. The chiefexecutive officer GE brought in two years ago has just beenreplaced by Steve Riedel, from its medical-equipmentheadquarters in Milwaukee; his job is to halt the hemorrhage.   GE's troubles show that even a big, mature companyrenowned for its management skills can stumble when enteringa starkly different business environment. Some analystswonder if GE can avoid the management faux pas it made atGE-CGR at its other new European subsidiaries, such as therecently acquired Hungarian light-bulb maker Tungsram.   &quot;Integrating cultures is one of the major challenges ofbusiness today; it's an acute problem,&quot; says MartinWaldenstrom, president of Booz-Allen Acquisition Services inParis. &quot;It's humiliating enough for a company to be acquired.If you add to that a very different style of management,chances are that both sides are going to have problems.&quot;   At CGR, employees accustomed to government subsidies andguaranteed purchases by state-owned hospitals have beenshocked by GE's corporate style. A maker of X-ray machines,CAT scanners and other large diagnostic machines forhospitals, CGR had little competitive-market experienceeither at home or abroad. And GE has had trouble teaching it.   For example, soon after the takeover, GE set out to fixCGR's financial-control system. U.S. computer specialists aresaid to have imposed a GE system that was unsuited to Frenchfinancial-reporting requirements or to the way CGR keptrecords, and the company spent months seeking a workablecompromise. Paulo Fresco, GE's senior vice president forinternational operations, says such events taught a lessonfor managing a foreign acquisition: &quot;Don't scrap the oldsystem before the new one is running.&quot;   GE managers made the painful restructuring even worse byplastering English-language posters everywhere, flying GEflags and otherwise making GE's culture ubiquitous. &quot;Theycame in here bragging, `We are GE, we're the best and we'vegot the methods,'&quot; says a CGR union leader. &quot;The more theysaid, the worse it got.&quot;   GE's culture is an extension of the strong personality ofits combative chairman, John F. Welch Jr. He preaches aphilosophy of self-reliance, hard work and big profits -- asort of evangelical capitalism. At company meetings in Paris,gung-ho American staffers would chant his credo -- &quot;speed,simplicity and self-confidence&quot; -- to skeptical Frenchmanagers.   GE's goal in acquiring CGR was to make France the centerof its European medical-equipment business, and it insiststhose plans haven't changed.   &quot;I think there is trauma in every acquisition,&quot; saysVincenzo Morelli, the 35-year-old GE whiz kid who was sent torun CGR after the takeover and who has just been transferredto London. &quot;Company cultures are always different.&quot;   An Italian who became a solid convert to GE's philosophy,Mr. Morelli calls the purchase &quot;a brilliant strategic move.&quot;GE took control in a complicated swap with state-controlledelectronics giant Thomson S.A. It got CGR and $800 million incash from Thomson in return for its RCA consumer-electronicsdivision.   Mr. Morelli says the purchase already has given GE astrong European presence. The company won't give figures forEurope, but says its world-wide medical business isprofitable. Orders for the first half at GE-CGR were up 18%over last year's period, GE says, and sales rose 10%. Itexpects CGR to turn a profit in 1991.   But Mr. Morelli and other GE executives acknowledge thatthe company did underestimate the cultural problems it wouldencounter. &quot;We've tried to avoid the impression of imposing avictorious culture on a vanquished culture,&quot; says Mr. Fresco.&quot;But nobody has discovered the perfect formula for culturalintegration.&quot;   French employees say they knew CGR was uncompetitive evenbefore GE appeared. They expected layoffs and restructuring,but say they haven't yet seen the organization and leadershipthey expected from GE.   &quot;The impression you get is that they are going to make a(serious) effort for a year or two, and if it doesn't work GEwill just pull out of most manufacturing here,&quot; says MichelHoueix, who heads GE-CGR's biggest union. GE insists it iscommitted to making the CGR operation a success.   In the short term, GE faces possible further defections bykey white-collar staffers, some of whom fear it is slowlyclosing CGR as a center of product development andproduction. The original plan, which many French employeesaccepted, was to make CGR part of the broader GEmedical-equipment network. CGR would stop producing some ofits most advanced items, such as scanners andmagnetic-resonance imagers, but would become a world leaderfor sophisticated ultrasound machines and devices fordetecting breast cancer.   But GE says it found some CGR products were uncompetitivetechnologically and much more expensive than GE's competingproducts being produced in Japan. So GE moved its ultrasoundproduction and development to Japan, entailingproduction-line closures and layoffs.   Thus, morale is low. Some of the best people are leaving,union leaders say, and turmoil at CGR makes it hard torecruit replacements. Today, only five of the 12 vicepresidents are French. Most key business functions --finance, marketing and personnel -- are run by Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
