The group, led by a subsidiary of PaineWebber Inc., also would assume more than $1 billion in debt of the Household unit as part of the leveraged buyout.    In the nine months, National Car Rental, the third-largest car rental company in the U.S., had profit of $20.3 million and revenue of $668.7 million.    But National also stands to lose investment tax credits under the new tax law, making it less attractive to a corporation such as Household, a diversified financial services concern. It also means the new owners will have to focus more on improving profitability from operations in the highly competitive car rental business.    Household, which acquired National in 1969, said that in addition to PaineWebber Capital Inc., the principal members of the investor group are Fidelco Capital Group, a private investment company based in Millburn, N.J., and Ardshiel Inc., a private investment banking concern in New York.    Household also said it expects to report a gain from the transaction for its fourth quarter, but didn't forecast an amount. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Household had net income of $50.3 million, or 86 cents a share. Household said it plans to use proceeds from the sale to expand its financial services and manufacturing interests. The company added that funds from the National transaction also may be used for acquisitions and to repurchase Household stock.    Officials of the investment group said profit generated by National's operations should be more than adequate to cover interest payments on the debt the group will incur to finance the acquisition. In a leveraged buyout, an acquisition is financed largely with borrowed funds. Those funds are repaid with cash generated by the company's continuing business, and sometimes by selling assets.    The investment group said that to help manage the rental car company it has recruited Vincent A. Wasik, a former executive vice president of rival Hertz Corp. It didn't specify Mr. Wasik's future position with National. He currently is a director of Hertz, which is a subsidiary of Chicago-based UAL Inc., and he also is a partner in Fidelco Capital.    Officials of the investment group didn't disclose plans for National's existing management. A Household official, however, said it was expected that National's management would remain intact.    Household said the transaction is subject to completion before year-end -- principally for tax reasons -- and approval by its directors.    Separately, Household said it is beginning a new program to repurchase its stock in open-market and privately negotiated transactions. The company said the purchases will be made in accordance with authorization from the company's directors to purchase up to $100 million of Household stock.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Household closed at $48.125, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
