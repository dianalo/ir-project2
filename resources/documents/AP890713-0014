Wednesday saw the fourth one-day strike in a month of thenational rail network and London subways. Yet the union leaders,while hardly popular national figures, appear as people with a realgrievance.   ``They're enjoying a remarkable amount of public supportconsidering how hard the public is hit directly,'' said RichardHope, editor of the Railway Gazette, a independent monthly.   He attributes this to a general sense that British Rail isunderpaying its staff as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cuts thestate-owned company's subsidies to the lowest in Europe.   The goal, in line with the free-market philosophy of Mrs.Thatcher's Conservative Party, is to make British Railself-financing. But what the public mostly sees is higher fares,demoralized staff and falling service standards.   A Gallup poll shows 69 percent of Britons favor more subsidies,not less.   With unfortunate timing, British Rail announced in the middle ofthe pay dispute that its profits were a record $492 million lastyear, largely from real estate sales.   Meanwhile, the media are focusing on recent hefty pay increasesfor top executives, such as the 86.5 percent raise for Lord Sharp,chairman of Cable and Wireless, who now earns $630,780 a year.   With overtime, train drivers average $24,840 a year and they wanta 10 percent raise to beat the 8.3 percent inflation rate.   A poll Wednesday in the usually pro-Thatcher Daily Mail showedthat of 2,770 rail passengers questioned, only 23 percent placedsole blame on the unions. It said 33 percent blamed management, 20percent blamed the government, and 14 percent thought all sides wereguilty. Ten percent had no opinion.   Mrs. Thatcher's last big battle against organized labor endedwith a crushing defeat for the coal miners in 1985, and widespreadapplause for the prime minister's tough stand.   But Jimmy Knapp, head of the 75,000 member National Union ofRailwaymen, is a benign figure, when compared to Arthur Scargill,the Marxist miners' leader who led surging crowds of pickets inpitched battles with police.   A gruff man with tufts of snow-white hair, Knapp sticks to asimple unpolitical message: that British Rail's 7 percent pay raiseoffer is below inflation, and that it wants to break up the unionand weaken its collective bargaining power.   Mrs. Thatcher says the strikers are selfish and dominated byleft-wing extremists, but in the image war, Knapp puts up a crediblechallenge. It has been some time since a British union boss wasdescribed in print as ``cuddly.''   Transport Minister Paul Channon's well-publicized walks to workon strike days were dismissed by the conservative Sunday Telegraphas ``embarrassingly unconvincing.''   And British Rail apparently miscalculated when, instead ofwaiting for the result of an arbitration effort, it asked the courtsto ban the strike.   The courts refused, and the public's sense of fair play wasoffended because the union had scrupulously obeyed Mrs. Thatcher'sunion-curbing laws by balloting its members and obtaining thenecessary 55 percent majority for a strike.   There are no mass pickets at train stations, just silence.Columnist Alan Watkins, in the liberal Observer newspaper, wonderswhat ``has happened to all those gentlemen, usually wearing bowlerhats, who would enliven any railway dispute by assaulting stationstaff with their umbrellas?''   The transport strikes are part of a wave of industrial unrestalso hitting the docks, the BBC and local government services.Coupled with resurgent inflation and rising interest rates, theyhave pushed Mrs. Thatcher to 10 points behind the socialist LaborParty in opinion polls.   Ironically, Mrs. Thatcher's own success in taming organized labormay now be working against her. Britons elected her in 1979 becausethey wanted a tough response to unions that were perceived as tooleft-wing and powerful. That perception has since waned.   ``A decade ago, 80 percent of people thought the trade unionswere too powerful. Now it's down to three in 10,'' says BobWorcester, head of Market and Opinion Research International.   ``A decade ago, 53 percent said most trade unions were controlledby extremists and militants, now it's only 20 percent.''   ``In a sense, the ballot has given strikes a spurious sense oflegitimacy,'' said Graham Mather of the right-wing Institute ofEconomic Affairs. He wants the government to implement its threat toban strikes in essential services.</TEXT></DOC>
