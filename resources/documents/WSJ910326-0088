Freedman   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/26/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   MO</CO><IN>TOBACCO PRODUCTS (TOB)FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)BIOGRAPHY (BIO)CONSUMER AND HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (HOU)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- As early as this week, when Philip Morris Cos.may name a successor to Chairman Hamish Maxwell, themarketing concern could send a signal about where its futurelies -- with its origins as a hugely profitable tobaccobusiness that now is under fire or with the massive foodbusinesses it acquired late in life.   Because Mr. Maxwell groomed no clear heir apparent, therumor mill has been working overtime at the company's NewYork headquarters, where the names of half a dozen contendershave been bandied about. But lately, many oddsmakers havebeen placing their bets on Michael A. Miles, who runs thecompany's $26 billion food business, Kraft General Foods.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Miles, 51 years old and a no-nonsense workaholic,would be the first chairman in Philip Morris's 144-yearhistory to have no roots in the tobacco business. The foodside comprises just more than half the company's total salesand 31% of profit. But the old-line tobacco trade stillprovides nearly two-thirds of operating profit. It isn'tsurprising, then, that Mr. Miles's major rival hails from theHouse of Tobacco: William Murray, 55, the low-key detail manwho oversees the company's domestic and international tobaccobusiness.   Neither executive would be interviewed. But the successiondecision, which may come as soon as tomorrow, underscoresthat Philip Morris is a company at a crossroads: Howsignificantly should it remake its tobacco-steeped culture?It still reigns as the nation's largest cigarette company,but the industry is shrinking and facing a troubled future.Now also the nation's largest food company, should PhilipMorris throw its weight behind a business that grows fasterand boasts a more wholesome reputation -- but which isn'tnearly as profitable?   &quot;Bill Murray represents the status quo, while Mike Milesrepresents the big shift,&quot; explains Anthony Regensburg, atobacco consultant at ASR Associates. &quot;The key question iswhether Philip Morris wants to continue to be a huge tobaccocompany with a major food subsidiary or to change theperception to a huge food company with a major tobaccosubsidiary.&quot;   The difference isn't just one of perception. The cigaretteside's flagship, the Marlboro brand, has emerged as the No. 1consumer franchise in the world, outselling even the likes ofCoke. Yet on the stock market, Coca-Cola Co. is valued farmore highly: Both marketers have growth rates of about 20%annually, but Coke's shares sell at a 33% premium to themarket, while Philip Morris is valued at about 10% less thanthe market average.   The chain-smoking, soft-spoken Mr. Maxwell, who has beenPhilip Morris's chairman and chief executive officer forseven years, all but created the company's current dilemmasingle-handedly. A former cigarette salesman and the son of atobacco-leaf dealer in Liverpool, England, Mr. Maxwell ledwhat is now heralded as Philip Morris's first successfuleffort to diversify when the company snapped up General FoodsCorp. in 1985. It bought Kraft Inc. three years later.   In casting their votes for the next chief executive,company directors are expected to assess two candidates whosestrengths differ sharply. Mr. Miles -- a nonsmoker who maytake over a company that thrives on the habit -- is widelyadmired as a marketing expert, both inside and outside KraftGeneral Foods. Since early 1989, he has integrated the twoformer food rivals, turning the combination into a colossusthat competitors truly fear.   Associates describe Mr. Miles as a manager who loves toponder the thick monthly operating reports from his variousfood divisions. He returns the reports in short order, loadedwith detailed comments and questions in the margins.   Mr. Miles is hardly a gadfly on the social circuit inChicago, near where Kraft is based. &quot;He doesn't have a greatfund of small talk -- he's too intense for that,&quot; says JohnCox, a former vice president of franchising at Kentucky FriedChicken, the chain that Mr. Miles is credited with revivingin the 1970s while working at the former Heublein Inc. &quot;Butif I'm in a fight for my life, I'd like to have him around.&quot;   At Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was in desperate straits,Mr. Miles confronted problems head-on, admitting that thechicken was overpriced, that service was terrible and thatthe stores were dirty.   In 1982, he became president of the former Kraft Inc. Whenhe took over Kraft General Foods two years ago, he used thesame up-front approach, prodding managers to admit toproblems in such brands as Maxwell House and Post Cereal. Afanatic on the subject of synergy -- which is now savingKraft $150 million annually -- Mr. Miles has also pushed forboosts in productivity through sometimes inventive gimmickry:Smaller lids on Miracle Whip have saved more than $1 milliona year.   Even though Mr. Miles is the front-runner in the eyes ofsome executives, few underestimate the psychological hurdlesthat company directors would have to overcome beforeentrusting Philip Morris to a man who has never soldcigarettes.   The other major contender for chief executive, Mr. Murray,is a dyed-in-the-wool tobacco merchant who has been the frontman for the low-profile company chairman. Born in Cooma,Australia, he is credited with helping to establish PhilipMorris's now-formidable international tobacco business afterbecoming president of the overseas unit in 1983.   Associates of Mr. Murray describe him as the ultimatecorporate executive, &quot;the man in the gray flannel suit.&quot; Hispersonal style is somewhat more self-conscious and tense thanMr. Miles's. Mr. Murray, a smoker like most top cigaretteexecutives, is described as more at home in the nitty-grittydetails of the tobacco business than in brainstorming grandstrategy.   But Mr. Murray's tobacco expertise may be critical, astobacco is the financial engine that carries the combinedcompany's enormous debt load of $18.7 billion -- and helpspay its enormous dividend. Despite a shrinking market in theU.S., the Philip Morris tobacco side is destined to remain apowerhouse.   &quot;They have a gigantic opportunity in the tobacco businessoutside the U.S., which wasn't obvious a few years ago&quot;before new markets like Japan and Eastern Europe opened up,says Marc Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.&quot;The question is whether a food guy is the right guy to putinto this. Can it be fully exploited?&quot;   Adds John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities:&quot;I have no doubt that a food guy will run Philip Morris --but are we one generation too early?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
