Continuous presenceof H{sub 2}-antagonist decreases the SR to a lower steady state, andon removal the SR returns to basal SR, causing a net loss of acid, thenonconservative effect. The amount of lost acid is a unique functionof exposure, thus, independent of the patterns (pulses or steps) of inhibition.In contrast, continuous presence of SCN{sup -} or NO{sub 2}{sup -} (below3 mM) results in an undershoot in SR with a return to basal SR, whereasat higher concentrations there is not return. Removal of these inhibitorscauses an overshoot in SR with return to basal SR. The rebound acid isequal to acid suppressed by NO{sub 2}{sup -} and low concentration ofSCN{sup -}, resulting in no net loss of acid, the conservative effect,whereas at high concentrations of SCN{sup -} there is an apparent lossof acid. In maximally secreting tissue the overshoot of SR is not observed.However, the acid is not lost, merely delayed. In resting tissue NO{sub2}{sup -} also merely delays the exit of the acid produced in responseto forskolin. The rebound acid is proposed to reside in a sequesteredacid pool that is stable for at least 120 min. Results with NO{sub 2}{sup-} and SCN{sup -} suggest an effect on a saturable exit enzyme, possiblythe K{sup +}-H{sup +}-ATPase.</TEXT></DOC>
