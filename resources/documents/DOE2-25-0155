Domestic naturalgas is in harsh environment because of competition in price with importednatural gas and petroleum. In Niigata Prefecture, a land subsidence problemconcerning water-soluble natural gas has been happening since middle1955. In contrast, Chiba Prefecture is good in geological condition andhas encountered only minor problems after 1965. At present, natural gasproduction is mainly switched to free natural gas; the gas shortage problemhas been solved by natural gas import. Akita and Yamagata Prefecturesare also using imported natural gas to compensate for the lack of naturalgas. In contrast, Hokkaido is expected to enter a new stage of increasingits natural gas production. If domestic natural gas is available on land,it is very promising because of short development periods and easy supplyusing existing distribution systems. Therefore, the development and collectionof natural gas in Hokkaido are a great expectation. A governmental bountyis available for natural gas mining. (4 figs, 6 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
