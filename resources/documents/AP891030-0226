In the end, the Axis paid for theflight of Jewish science from Europe.   In Denmark, Niels Bohr, a rugged theoretician who excelled atsoccer and transcended in physics to become a national hero, was aclearinghouse of atomic information as well as a haven for emigreJewish researchers.   One of those who escaped to Copenhagen was a young physicist,Otto Frisch. His aunt, Lise Meitner, a chemist, continued workingat the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. As an Austrian she wasnot subject to Hitler's Aryan laws. She was born in Vienna in 1886and became only the second woman there to earn a doctorate. She wasaccepted for further study at KWI on the proviso that as a womanshe never show her face above her lab in the woodshop in thebasement. A pretty but shy young woman whose love in her life wasscience, she accepted such exile.   She formed a long and close partnership with Otto Hahn, also achemist. He was a handsome, gregarious outdoorsman. During WorldWar I he had worked on the dark side of chemistry _ helping withGermany's poison gas detachments. He justified it as a means,however murderous, of saving more lives by shortening the war. Thethought was not original with wartime scientists, then or later.   Although they never even lunched together, Hahn and Meitner werea close team, talking over their work on the atom's mysteries onlong walks, walking having played an inordinate role in the atom'sdeciphering.   When Hitler's troops marched into Austria in 1938, Meitner losther immunity. She hurriedly packed to leave for the Netherlands. Infarewell, Hahn gave her a treasured diamond ring that had been hismother's. ``I wanted her to be provided for in an emergency.''   Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, had closed the border tofleeing scholastics. Meitner tried to look composed as soldiersexamined her passport.   ``I knew that the Nazis had just declared open season on theJews, that the hunt was on. For 10 minutes I sat there and waited,10 minutes that seemed like so many hours.''   Then the soldiers passed her over the border. Unaware, they hadlet a genie out of a bottle.   Back in Berlin, Hahn continued bombarding uranium, now withFritz Strassmann. In early December of 1938 Hahn wrote Meitner, nowin Sweden, that something most unusual had happened. He andStrassmann had found after one experiment that the uranium seemedto have divided into two isotopes of barium whose weight did notquite duplicate the weight of the original target. Although Hahnhad a good idea of what had happened, he asked Meitner for herthoughts. And wished her a ``bearable Christmas.''   Meitner was spending the holiday with friends near Goteborg.There she was joined by Frisch, whose father was still interned inthe concentration camp at Dachau following the anti-Jewish pogromof Kristallnacht.   On Christmas Eve, Frisch wanted to go cross-country skiing.Meitner said she would walk along. Frish feared she couldn't keepup. Oh yes, she could, Meitner insisted. She wanted to talk withFrisch about Hahn's news. Frisch wanted to talk about a magnet hehad designed.   ``Finally we became absorbed in my problem,'' she recalled.   They sat down on a log and began sketching with a piece of paperand a pencil Meitner had in her purse. She vividly remembered yearsago hearing Einstein lecture on his theory of relativity and howthe E equals mc2 evolved.   She made the calculation of what the loss of weight in Hahn'stwo barium isotopes had been compared to the uranium in terms ofEinstein's formula. The weight loss corresponded perfectly with theenergy that would been produced.   Hahn and Strassmann had split an atom. Energy was released. Anew door had opened on the possibility of a chain reaction.   Ironically, only a few days before, Szilard, now in the UnitedStates at the University of Rochester, had written the BritishAdmiralty asking it to withdraw his patent on a chain reaction. Theodds of it happening, he explained, had ``just about reached thevanishing point.''   Just after the New Year Meitner cautiously wrote Hahn that``perhaps ... such a heavy nucleus bursts.''   On Jan. 3, 1939, Frisch, back in Copenhagen, began outliningwhat the news from Germany had been and his discussion about itwith his aunt.   Bohr's rapid mind raced ahead of his words.   ``Oh, what idiots we have been!'' he said slapping his forehead.``This is just as it must be!''   Bohr was due to leave in four days for a stint at the Institutefor Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. He asked that a blackboard beinstalled in his stateroom aboard the ship.   He had some noodling to do about atoms as he crossed theAtlantic. A scientist from the Old World was bearing some startlingnews to his colleagues in the New.</TEXT><NOTE>NEXT: The scientists write the president.</NOTE><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
