Interest rates, trade deficits and political campaigns all have influenced stock prices for better or worse since the crash last October. But in the end it all boils down to a stock market squeezed between a top that stubbornly resists penetration and a bottom that investors hope is impenetrable.    Last week was no exception. Hot on the heels of a big rally the previous Friday, investors pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a post-crash high of 2158.96 on Columbus Day. But the margin by which the Dow industrials did so was less than three tenths of a point -- too narrow to mean anything to most analysts. And the remainder of the week was spent moving in fits and starts below the top.    Why is it that stock prices can't seem to soar to startling new heights? Or, for that matter, plunge to sickening new post-crash lows?    Caution is the simple answer. The post-crash investor is very wary. Those who remain in stocks aren't letting either fear or greed get in the way of cold analysis of values. And portfolio strategists, money managers and traders agree that it's that return to old-fashioned value analysis that keeps the ceiling over and the floor beneath stock prices.    &quot;We're back to Graham andamp; Dodd and Warren Buffet,&quot; says Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., referring to the seminal textbook authors and the leading practitioner of value investing. &quot;Investors today are more than willing to adhere to traditional measures of stock valuation. They're not willing to participate in another mania like we saw in 1986 and 1987&quot; when stock prices were severely inflated by traditional standards.    In its simplest form, Mr. Johnson says, the trading range of stock prices is bounded on the bottom by the strength of the economy and the prospects for healthy corporate earnings. When stock prices fall to certain levels, investors perceive that they're cheap and begin buying. The top boundary is defined by the return from alternative investments, principally bonds. When stock prices rise high enough investors figure the return from expensive stocks is too chancy compared with bonds.    Of course, that doesn't mean that the trading range itself can't move higher or lower as economic conditions and investors' perceptions change. Early this year, for example, market watchers were talking about a trading range of 1,800 to 2,100 on the Dow Jones industrials. Now many believe the range is between 2,000 and 2,200. And Abby Joseph Cohen, a portfolio strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, suggests the range is headed higher.    For one thing, she thinks investors are becoming more comfortable with the idea that the current economic expansion will be particularly long-lived. She recalls that at the beginning of 1988, there was widespread fear that the stock market crash would precipitate a recession in the second quarter and stock prices reflected those fears. The recession didn't occur, the economy picked up steam and fears then arose about inflation. Now, with the economy slowing to a sustainable rate of growth, she thinks more investors are taking an optimistic view of the economy and corporate earnings expectations.    At the same time, she says, the slowing economy is easing the competitive pressure from the bond market. She notes that the yield on long-term Treasury bonds has fallen in the past several weeks, to below 9% from 9.5%.    &quot;The upper limit of the trading range is being redefined,&quot; Ms. Cohen says. &quot;It looks to us like fair value for stocks in this environment is 2200 or 2300 on the Dow Jones industrials.&quot;    A key question: How long will the stock market remain locked in a trading range, regardless of its boundaries?    Some analysts suggest that stock prices could push sharply higher in the near future. Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney, Montgomery Scott, said the move to a new high in prices last week coupled with the growing interest in stocks by cash-rich institutions is setting the foundation for a potential 5% to 8% increase in prices. &quot;I'm just short of saying we're in a bull market,&quot; he says. His single reservation is that the mood of investors is becoming optimistic too fast.    Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few &quot;ifs.&quot; One is if investors don't get spooked at the anniversary of the crash. Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates. And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election.    &quot;A downtick in interest rates would be an important ingredient in getting out of a trading range,&quot; he says, &quot;and a Republican victory would get investors back into the market.&quot;    But others don't think a significant push higher is in the cards. &quot;If you're looking for something more than just another incremental step higher, emotion would have to take over,&quot; says First Albany's Mr. Johnson. &quot;The memories of last October are still too fresh for that to happen.&quot;    And Rajiv Sharma, a money manager in Larkspur, Calif., recalls that stock prices were mired in a trading range bounded on the top by 1000 on the Dow Jones industrials from the late 1960s to 1982. &quot;A lot of institutional investors and money managers aren't considering the possibility that stocks could be stuck between 1800 and 2500 for another five to 10 years,&quot; he says   ---   Friday Market Activity   Stock prices edged lower in moderate trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.18 point to 2133.18. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 160.2 million shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board outpaced losers, 740 to 647. For the week, the industrial average was off 17.07.    Economic indicators showing a slowing economy failed to energize investors. The government reported that retail sales dropped 0.5% in September while the producer price index rose 0.4%. Traders said profit-taking contributed to the slight decline.    Hospital Corp. of America, the target of a management buy-out bid at $51 a share, was the biggest gainer on the Big Board. It rose 3 3/4 to 48 1/4 despite an announcement from Moody's Investors Service Inc. that it is reviewing the debt ratings of the company for possible downgrading.    Birmingham Steel rose 2 1/4 to 23 7/8. Chairman James A. Todd Jr. told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that analysts are boosting their earnings estimates following his statement at the company's annual meeting Oct. 6 that he expects to report record earnings for the first quarter, ended Sept. 30.    Centerior Energy was the most active issue on the Big Board. It lost 1/8 to 13 1/4 on volume of 15.4 million shares. The stock carries a 12.1% dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today.    Longview Fibre was the biggest loser. It dropped 4 7/8 to 70. Chairman R.P. Wollenberg said that he didn't know why the stock dropped and that rumors the company is for sale are false.    International Business Machines closed at 119 3/4, up 1 1/8, after reporting third-quarter net income rose to $1.25 billion, or $2.10 a share, from $1.21 billion, or $2 a share, a year earlier.    Among other blue chips, Boeing rose 5/8 to 65; Chevron gained 5/8 to 46 3/4; Westinghouse climbed 7/8 to 53 7/8; and Eastman Kodak closed at 48, up 5/8. Sears was off 1 3/8 to 41, Du Pont lost 5/8 to 81 1/2 and Philip Morris closed down 5/8 at 98 5/8. </TEXT></DOC>
