<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1412 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a combined method for the separation of nitric and sulphur oxides byusing a scrubbing liquid which contains an iron(II) amino polycarboxylicacid complex salt and alkali ions or alkaline earth ions (according toP 3537480.2), the scrubbing liquid is additionally supplied with gaseoussulphur dioxide. As for flue gases with a SO/sub x//NO/sub x/ molar ratioof less than 3, the degree of NO/sub x/ separation can economically beincreased by this measure. The sulphite ion concentration increased bythe addition of SO/sub 2/ allows the additional reduction of the oxidizediron(III) to iron(II) with metallic iron or zinc. By the addition ofSO/sub 2/ before or during the gypsum reprecipitation an increase ofthe pH value and thus the sedimentation of calcium hydroxide can be prevented.</TEXT></DOC>
