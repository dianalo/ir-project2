SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new study of U.S. weather records for thepast century may raise questions about the theory that the Earth isbeing warmed like the inside of a greenhouse.   Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationreport that they can find no evidence of any overall temperatureincrease for the United States, although weather does varyconsiderably from year to year.   The report, in the January edition of Geophysical ResearchLetters, showed no significant change in the nation's averagetemperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987.   Researchers agree, however, that since the study covers only asmall portion of the Earth, studies of other areas might havedifferent results. And while the new study is not necessarilyinconsistent with a so-called greenhouse effect, it fuels anescalating scientific debate.   Claims that a greenhouse-like warming has already begun haveattracted widespread publicity recently, with the heat and droughtthis past summer attracting additional attention.   According to the theory, the increasing amount of carbon dioxideand some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heat from thesun, warming the earth in somewhat the same way as the glass warms agreenhouse.   Such a warming could damage crop growing areas, melt the polarice caps, raise sea levels and have other dire effects, according toa variety of analyses that have been published.   Scientists expressed skepticism about whether the warming hasalready begun, however, at last month's meeting of the AmericanGeophysical Union in San Francisco.   Indeed, some climate experts say any warming would likely resultin more cloudiness, and that would tend to cool the Earth byreflecting some sunlight back into space.   In addition, a study published in the Journal of Climate inNovember disclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1degree Fahrenheit could be attributed to the heat generated bygrowing cities, since many weather stations are located in urbanareas.   ``The most important result of this study is that there is nostatistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annualtemperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguousU.S., 1895-1987,'' concluded the authors of the new analysis.   That report was compiled by Kirby Hanson of the NOAA AirResources Laboratory, George A. Maul of the NOAA AtlanticOceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and Thomas R. Karl ofthe National Climatic Data Center.   They looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhousetheory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result inchanges in rainfall patterns, causing drought in some areas.   ``Assuming the numbers are right, they are not inconsistent''with the greenhouse theory, responded John Topping of the ClimateInstitute.   Topping, who organized a recent conference on coping with thegreenhouse effect, noted that the study covers only the UnitedStates _ only about 6 percent of the Earth _ and suggested thatsimilar analyses of other areas might have different results.   Hanson has concurred that the study covers only a small part ofthe world and that the finding may only represent a regionalvariation rather than a worldwide trend.   James E. Hansen, director of the National Aviation and SpaceAdministration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Wednesdaythat he was not surprised by the result.   Hansen, who told Congress last summer that he believes thegreenhouse warming has begun to affect Earth, said that the argumentis over whether the warming has become large enough to measure.   Determining that may be hard to do, however, the NOAA researcherspointed out in their analysis.   Lack of good records in some areas and changes in instruments,methods of observation, exposure of thermometers, time ofobservations and other problems make the problem of comparinghistorical records extremely complex.   In their study they analyzed records from some 6,000 observingpoints over 93 years and found considerable year-to-year variationbut no long-term trend other than an increase in precipitation, inthe fall, between 1970 and 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
