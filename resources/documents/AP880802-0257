HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A strike by railroad workers against Chicago andamp;North Western Transportation Co. cannot be avoided, and an extendedcooling-off period would only ``prolong the inevitable,'' a companyofficial says.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., planned to introduce legislation todayto extend a cooling-off period in the labor dispute for 36 days,hoping to avert a strike Thursday that would disrupt rail serviceto 41,000 Chicago-area commuters and stall Midwest freight.   But an official of CNW Corp., the railroad's parent firm, saidlate Monday night such a move would be fruitless since the UnitedTransportation Union had rejected the company's latest compromiseoffer.   ``All it would do is prolong the inevitable,'' said James Foote,assistant vice president of communications for the Chicago-basedcompany. ``Eventually there's going to have to be a strike overthis issue. There appears to be no way around it.''   The union's general chairman, Donald Markgraf, did not return atelephone message left at his home Monday night seeking a responseto Foote's comments.   The dispute revolves around the railroad's plans to save $51million a year by cutting the size of most train crews from four totwo people. The company wants to eliminate what it considersunnecessary brakemen's jobs, leaving an engineer and conductor onboard _ a move the union vigorously opposes.   ``These work rules date back to the steam engine era,'' Footesaid. ``We've compromised and compromised and compromised, but theunion has remained steadfast on this issue.''   In its latest proposal, the railroad offered Monday to accept arecommendation by a presidential emergency board and eliminate 700brakemen's jobs instead of the 1,150 cuts it has been planning tomake.   But union general counsel Robert Hart said such a compromise wasunacceptable and would not settle the dispute as the 12:01 a.m.Thursday strike deadline loomed.   In Washington, Simon spokesman David Carle said the Illinoissenator would propose an extension of the cooling-off periodimposed by President Reagan to give both sides ``breathing room''to come up with a solution.   Foote said, however, he did not see any reason for such a stepbecause more than two years of negotiations with the union havefailed to solve the dispute.   The presidential emergency board, appointed by Reagan to resolvethe dispute, recommended in July that all the railroad's freighttrains be operated with three brakemen instead of four, and thatonly two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains, Footesaid.   The railroad initially rejected that proposal, but said Mondayit would accept it in hopes of averting a walk-out.   A strike would affect commuters in a six-county area aroundChicago for whom Candamp;NW provides service through an agreement withMetra, a suburban commuter rail service.   It also could affect freight service in several Midwesternstates. But Foote said Candamp;NW had trained management personnel toperform the unionized jobs and planned to operate its freightservice _ constituting 95 percent of its business _ throughout anystrike.   Foote said the railroad would not resume commuter servicebecause of the potential for vandalism or other problems during astrike.   ``We're prepared to operate our freight lines for however longit takes,'' Foote said. ``As long as we're under a strikesituation, we will not operate our commuter rail lines becauseevery day that goes by the union will become more desperate.''   Metra Chairman Jeff Ladd said Monday both sides ``are actingwith callous disregard to the public'' by failing to settle thedispute.   Ladd and Samuel Skinner, chairman of the Regional TransportationAuthority that oversees Chicago-area commuter rail service, urgedboth sides to resume negotiations because a strike would causechaos throughout the suburbs.   Candamp;NW's freight operations run on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000employees in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.   Candamp;NW ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in revenue, generating$893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight.</TEXT></DOC>
