A subpoena filed in a federal court in Alexandria, Va., indicates that investigators believe Mr. Muldoon may have managed to obtain &quot;the government acquisition plans&quot; on three programs: a fiber-optic cable system; the MRC-139 radio set; and the ATACC, a command and control system for the Marine Corps.    The subpoena is the first to be released of the almost 300 that were issued in the sweeping investigation. It also indicates that federal investigators believe Mr. Muldoon may have represented numerous defense contractors, including Gould Inc., Whittaker Corp., and a company identified as PRC -- companies that hadn't been linked to him previously.    In addition, the government believes that Mr. Muldoon worked for Norden Systems Inc., a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.; Unisys Corp.; Hazeltine Corp; Emhart Corp., JIL; Vitro; Adtech; A-Z Tech; Miltope Group Inc., and Litton Industries Inc.    If Mr. Muldoon were able to obtain some of the Pentagon's acquisition plans, he would be in a position to know, or pass on, inside information on the Navy's military requirements, its spending plans, and when it planned to make decisions on awarding contracts.    Several companies were competing for each of the three projects for which the subpoena suggested Mr. Muldoon may have obtained the Navy's acquisition plans. Norden, for instance, was one of the contenders for the command and control system contract.    Norden recently said it is no longer seeking that job.    The subpoena was attached to a motion filed by Albert Ahern, Mr. Muldoon's lawyer, seeking copies of the government affidavits supporting a search of Mr. Muldoon's office last month. Mr. Ahern said he couldn't comment on the merits of the government investigation, which included a government wiretap of Mr. Muldoon's telephone conversations.    The subpoena also demanded all contracts, payment records, invoices and correspondence involving Mr. Muldoon's &quot;business relationships&quot; dating back to 1980 with defense industry consultants William Parkin and William Sanda. Court documents released previously hadn't linked Mr. Muldoon with either of those two men.    Court records released in Dallas detailed Mr. Muldoon's alleged dealings with another consultant, Mark Saunders. According to those papers, Mr. Saunders told Mr. Muldoon in December 1987 that the government &quot;has decided to eliminate all but two companies&quot; from the final competition for the contract to build the Marine command and control system. Mr. Saunders allegedly described information he was passing on to Mr. Muldoon as &quot;extraordinarily private.&quot;    The affidavits released in Dallas also alleged that Mr. Muldoon was receiving &quot;$8,000 per month&quot; from Litton, and that he paid Mr. Saunders $4,000 of that amount.    The Dallas affidavits, submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that in wiretapped conversations, Mr. Muldoon &quot;described the nature of his work as obtaining information for contractors which the contractors cannot obtain themselves.&quot; Further, they said that he spoke almost daily with Mr. Saunders, who &quot;provides him with information and documents relating to various government contracts.&quot;    The affidavits said that Mr. Saunders obtained some of his information from a Navy official, and that the government believed that Mr. Saunders was paying the official for the data.    The ATACC contract, which could be worth $120 million, hasn't yet been awarded. The $51 million fiber-optic contract was awarded to ITT Corp. The $49 million MRC-139 radio contract was shared by Loral Corp., Terracom and Canadian Marconi.    ---   Edward T. Pound contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
