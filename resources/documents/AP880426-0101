Three Arabs and two Israeli soldierswere killed.   Two other soldiers were wounded, the army said. One was inserious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, hospitalauthorities said.   The Israeli army said the clash occurred 200 yards inside Israelafter troops on an early morning patrol encountered guerrillastrying to infiltrate from Lebanon.   However, a Lebanese police spokesman said the pre-dawn clashoccurred in Lebanese territory near the southern village of KfarShouba when Israeli troops opened fire at a seven-man guerrillagroup.   The army said soldiers chased the guerrillas through rockyterrain and scrub brush and fought a brief battle in which theguerrillas threw hand grenades and fired a rocket.   The Lebanese police spokesman said the ``fierce clash'' ragedfor about three hours.   The Israelis ``fired flares at the rate of 20 every five minutesas their helicopter gunships chased the guerrillas in the region,''he said.   The guerrillas were ``apparently ambushed before launching across-border raid into northern Israel,'' the spokesman said. Hespoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standingregulations.   Israeli radio said the soldiers fought the guerrillas at adistance of two yards but did not give the exact site of the clash.   The Lebanese police spokesman said the guerrillas were from twopro-Soviet groups, the Lebanese Communist Party and the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine of George Habash.   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, identified theguerrillas as Palestinians. However, the Lebanese Communist Partyis made up of Lebanese.   Kfar Chuba is a small village on the slopes of biblical Mt.Hermon, about one mile from an area where the borders of Lebanon,Israel and Syria converge.   The Lebanese village is inside Israel's self-designated``security zone.'' The zone, intended to protect Israel fromattacks across the border, was created by Israel in 1985 after itwithdrew most of its forces from Lebanon. Israel had invadedLebanon in 1982.   Peled said the guerrillas had targeted ``civilians, children,Israeli settlements'' in their raid.   The army did not say whether any guerrillas escaped. News of theincident was held up eight hours while the border was searched.   ``It was difficult, bushy terrain, easy to hide in,'' said amilitary commander at the scene who was interviewed by Israeliradio but not identified in keeping with army regulations.   ``We closed off the area and chased them for several hours. Theyhid in the bushes and were difficult to see,'' he said. ``Theyfired first at our force and the soldiers fired back.''   Today's incident was the 11th attempted infiltration and thedeadliest along the Lebanese border since Nov. 25 when a guerrillalanded in northern Israel on a hang glider, entered a military baseand killed six Israeli soldiers before being shot to death himself.   Israeli officials have linked past infiltration attempts to anearly five-month long Arab uprising in the occupied territories inwhich 173 Palestinians and two Israelis have died.   The two dead soldiers were the first Israeli casualtiesinvolving Lebanon since Feb. 23, when two soldiers died when theirtank ran over a mine in south Lebanon.   The most recent attempted infiltration was April 13, whensoldiers shot and killed three Arab guerrillas on a hostage-takingmission.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, U.N. officials and newsreports said Israeli steps to break the Palestinian uprising couldtemporarily block tens of thousands of Palestinians from reachingjobs in Israel.   Christine Dabagh, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and WorksAgency, said the army was preventing people from reaching jobs bytaking their identity cards and returning them only after the Arabsunderwent lengthy checks at three government offices.   Israeli television said the program was aimed at breaking a taxboycott that has been a tactic of the Palestinian uprising.   In New York, meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council condemned theassassination of the PLO's military commander. The United Statesdid not use its veto, allowing the resolution to pass 14-0.   Khalil Wazir, the No. 2 man in the Palestine LiberationOrganization, was gunned down April 16 at his home in Tunisia.Israeli sources and Tunisian officials have said Wazir was slain byIsraeli commandos. The Israeli government has declined comment.   Israeli leaders expressed concern about attempts by PLO leaderYasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad to end five years ofbloody rivalry and revive a hard-line alliance against Israel.   Assad, who expelled Arafat from Syria in 1983, met the PLO chiefon Monday in Damascus.</TEXT></DOC>
