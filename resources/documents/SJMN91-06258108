They'repulling for you, too,&quot; Herbert assured the 58-year-old man as he climbedthrough an open window to safety Friday morning.;   Other members of thepolice negotiating team came up and patted the distraught man on the back.;  &quot;We tried to point out to him that people really did care,&quot; Herbert said. &quot;I'mglad he made it -- real glad. He's a nice man, a nice man.&quot;;   Minutes later,the man, identified as a janitorial supervisor in the building, was on the wayto Valley Medical Center for psychiatric observation, ending the tense90-minute drama. Police would not say why the man was despondent.;   The manapparently gained access to the foot-wide ledge by climbing out of the windowof an unoccupied office in the building, located at First and Santa Clarastreets. He told officers he went out about 9 a.m., but police were notnotified until 45 minutes later.;   'I couldn't believe it'; That's when TimClendening, a Computerland sales representative, glanced up from his desk onthe third floor of the Koll Building a block away and saw a man with his backagainst the south wall &quot;staring up at the sun.&quot;;   &quot;I couldn't believe it,&quot;Clendening said. While his co-workers gathered at the windows to watch,Clendening phoned police. Officers quickly cordoned off the streets. A medicalunit stood by.;   Officers arrive; Sgt. Mark Bell was one of the firstofficers to arrive. Leaning out of a window a few feet away, Bell spoke withthe man for a long time before Herbert relieved him. It was hot, and the man,dressed in work pants and a long-sleeved flannel shirt, was perspiringprofusely. That especially worried Herbert because he could have become dizzyfrom dehydration. The officers managed at times to get him to drink water froma paper cup.;   &quot;It's hard to know what a despondent person is going to do.Sometimes they don't even know,&quot; said Herbert, who has participated in manyhostage and suicide negotiations since 1980. &quot;But I always go on the premisethat they all intend to take their life. When you have a man on a ledge, it'sno time to wonder if he's only kidding.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BILL ROMANO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910914  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  472  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 14, 199100258108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
