The two-day session, which ended Sunday, was the first nationalconference of the reform movement. It followed a meeting inKecskemet on April 15 when Communist Party members urged majorchanges in Hungary's political structure.   In a final resolution, the delegates representing 110 workinggroups from throughout Hungary said an official declaration shouldbe issued rehabilitating Nagy and state that he was the victim of a``rigged political trial.''   Conference delegates reviewed the 40 years of Communist ruleafter World War II and declared:   _A special congress of the Communist Party should be held nextfall, ahead of the session scheduled in 1990, ``to clear allpolitical issues as to where the party is going.''   _Representatives to the congress should be elected at locallevels.   _The party should reject ``democratic centralism'' _ theprinciple that the minority should accept all decisions adopted bythe majority.   _The Communist Party should change its name to HungarianSocialist Party, Democratic Socialist People's Party or theHungarian Reform Party ``to reflect its new, democratic character.''   But the issue of the rehabilitation of Nagy, the premier whenthe Soviets sent troops into Hungary to crush a revolt, was themost emotional issue.   The resolution said the rehabilitation should be declared beforethe June 16 reburial of Nagy's remains.   The burial ceremony is to be broadcast by state television butthe government has no plans to be officially represented.   Nagy, who formed a coalition government in 1956 that tried tobreak with the Soviet Union and Warsaw pact, and others convictedof revolutionary activities were executed on June 16, 1958. Theirbodies were buried in unmarked graves.   Earlier this year the government, under intense pressure, agreedto reburial of the bodies and the funeral.   A government commission is reviewing Nagy's trial.   Imre Pozsgay, a reform member of the Communist Party'sPolitburo, told a news conference Saturday the impatience ofreformers for a quick decision on Naby's rehabilitation wasjustified. But he said he would wait until the public prosecutorfiles a final report, expected sometime this fall.   ``Execution for political reasons cannot be justified under anycircumstances,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
