The Labor Department's official figure for non-farm payrollexpansion last month was 110,000 jobs. But strikes reduced the jobtotals by about 108,000 _ meaning that without the walkouts thenew-job total would have been some 218,000.   The government also revised its July job growth figure upward to184,000 from 169,000, and the June totals up again from 250,000 to297,000, further signs that the economy continues to expand at apace that will keep it out of recession in the short term.   The stock market greeted the unemployment report favorably, whilebond prices moved sharply higher after another closely watchedeconomic report suggested a possible upcoming manufacturing slowdown.   Bond prices jumped after the National Association of PurchasingManagement released its Purchasing Managers' Index, which plunged to45.2 percent in August from 46 percent in July. A reading below 50percent indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is indecline.   But other data released this week, including two more reportsFriday, also suggested economic strength, leaving little doubt theexpansion will begin its eighth year come November.   ``We still have a very solid labor market,'' said Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette senior vice president Elliot Platt. ``The evidenceis clear that the economy remains strong and we are clearly notplunging into recession.''   Said DRI-McGraw-Hill chief economist David Wyss: ``Once again theeconomy looks stronger than we thought it was. We're really notseeing much sign of slowdown.''   In the other reports released Friday:   _The Commerce Department said its chief economic forecastinggauge rose in July for the first time in three months. The Index ofLeading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percent afterregistering no gain in June and plunging by 1.3 percent in May, thebiggest drop since late 1987 following the stock market crash.   _Commerce said construction spending inched up 0.02 percent,rising by $100 million to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of$415.7 billion in July. The modest increase followed a decline inJune, and analysts said it offered hope the lengthy constructionslump is over.   These reports came on the heels of a sharp upward revision in theprojected rate of economic growth in the second quarter. Thegovernment earlier this week said the gross national product grew atan annual rate of 2.7 percent in the April-June period, up from a1.7 percent preliminary estimate. The unemployment report, the firstcomprehensive look at August economic performance, indicated similargrowth in the third quarter.   All but gone are the predictions of recession that were easy tofind in the spring. Since then the Federal Reserve has eased itshold on credit after a year-long tightening designed to slow growthand curb inflation.   Now all but a smattering of forecasters believe the economy isgrowing at a sustainable pace, with only dogged inflationthreatening to trigger recession in late 1990 or 1991.   ``The primary fear now is that the economy is going to take offagain and inflation with it and that the Fed is going to have to hitthe breaks again,'' said Wyss.   Wage data in the report should prove encouraging to inflationwatchers, although perhaps discouraging to workers.   The government said average hourly earnings were essentiallyunchanged last month _ actually falling by a tiny fraction _ afterrising 0.7 percent from June to July. For the year ending in Augustaverage hourly wages were up 3.9 percent, the government said, wellbelow the pace of consumer inflation.   The report also showed a slight reduction in factory activity,with the average manufacturing work week dropping 0.1 hour to 40.9hours. Average factory overtime dropped by the same amount to 3.9hours a week.   The Labor Department said the civilian jobless rate held steadyat 5.2 percent in a month that saw number of Americans looking forwork but unable to find jobs fall by a modest 76,000 to 6.42million. More than 117.5 million Americans had jobs, an increase of138,000 from July.   The official job-growth numbers were skewed by severalstrike-related developments. About 130,000 telephone workers wereout on strike, while about 20,000 coal miners returned to work afterwalkouts.   Strikes affect the data because the job totals are taken from agovernment survey of businesses, and strikers are not counted asbeing on payrolls. But strikes do not affect the unemployment ratebecause that statistic is taken from a separate household survey inwhich strikers are considered to still have jobs.   The new job growth was predominantly in the service-producingsector, which added nearly 70,000 jobs. That number would have beenhigher in a normal month because the telephone workers fall into theservice portion of the economy.   Manufacturing and construction posted modest gains in August of11,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively. The manufacturing total showedslight job declines in some areas, including furniture and lumberproducts, but a gain of 25,000 in auto manufacturing, a sign thatautomakers called back some of the workers laid off because ofsluggish sales.   In a separate calculation that includes military personnelstationed in the United States, the Labor Department said theunemployment rate was 5.1 percent, down from July's 5.2 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
