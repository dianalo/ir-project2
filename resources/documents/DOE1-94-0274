For example, small-scaleenergy sources are needed to power public TV set, small pumping systemfor drinking water, refrigerator for health center, and other small electricappliances for households in remote areas. Fuel cells cost more initiallythan does the equipment now in widespread use for such applications -chiefly primary cells and diesel generator - similar to solar cells -but in many cases will be cheaper in the long run. This paper discussesthe cost comparison of energy generated by fuel cell power generation,solar cell, diesel generator, and the extension of electric grid. Thesite that is chosen for this study is Kenteng, an agricultural village.The results indicated that there are sufficient economic incentives forfuel cell power generation in this case if the projected goals of capitalcost and heat rate can be met.</TEXT></DOC>
