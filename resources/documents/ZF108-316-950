 The 10largest pending or recently awarded procurements based on Unix could togethereventually be some $10,000m, approaching the size of the 1988 worldwide Unixsystems market.andP;  Nobody, however, is suggesting that path to riches is alwayssimple.andP;  First, there's the gestation period of up to five or even ten yearswhile a billion-dollar procurement slowly proceeds from conception to formalRequest For Procurement and eventual award.andP;  There's the multi-million dollarcost of preparing and bidding for these contracts.andP;  Then there is themargin-cutting competitive bidding for business from a government whose useof standards is driven by the need to cut costs - and which is still hauntedby the publicity surrounding tales of $250 hammers slipped into contractors'expenses.andM;FoulandM;And no sooner has the winning supplier reached the post than it is confrontedwith a new set of hurdles, often starting with another vendor crying foul andchallenging the contract award.andP;  Take for instance Zenith's dispute (sincesettled) of the award to Unisys of the current $700m Desktop III successor tothe earlier Zenith-won Desktop II, or the Martin-Marietta protests over theHoneywell-Apple success in the $164m Air Force contract for some 10,000 A/UXMacs last August.andP;  Even if objections are quelled, functional tests passed(another Desktop III stumbling block) and first shipment dates agreed,there's always the chance that the procurement may never result in anythinglike the huge sales volumes suggested in the procurement documents.andO;Commented Lynn Boyd, vice-president of Federal operations at Uniplex, whichhas won or been involved in numerous government procurements, &quot;Many of thehuge Federal programmes are structured as IDIQ - Indefinite DeliveryIndefinite Quantity&quot; - which means that the Government may buy up to acertain number of systems but &quot;doesn't guarantee any quantity&quot;.andP;  Vendors that&quot;believe in the strength of their products&quot; and actively help in the saleseffort after the contract award can do well from these contracts, sheclaimed; on the other hand, to think that merely pitching a product that is&quot;below market strength&quot; will result in volume sales &quot;is very nave&quot;.andP;  Largeprocurements may now provide a framework for various agencies to buy systems,and to achieve maximum penetration suppliers may, it seems, have to put in asmuch sales effort after the contract award as before.andP;  Other observersselected the widely publicised example of AFCAC 251, the huge contract forsmall multi-user office systems originally estimated at $3,500m.andP;  Followingaward of the contract to ATandamp;T with the Prelude software from Phase II SystemsInc, Cambridge, Massachusetts, the press was filled with suggestions thatonly a fraction of the planned volume of shipments was taking place, due inpart to lack of sales effort.andM;By Mike FadenandM;Air Force officials now say that the contract is &quot;on schedule&quot;, but Phase IIpresident Bill Spencer admitted a slow start and some disappointment, partlyrelated to internal factors at ATandamp;T but also involving a mismatch between theproducts supplied and the high expectations of some users apparentlyanticipating a high-powered equivalent of personal computer officeapplications, resulting in negative publicity on the government grapevine andsubsequent lack of take-up of the products.andP;  Many of these large contractscontinue to centre on providing office automation, and the increasing trustplaced in Unix systems for the purpose is indicated both by the sheer volumeof contracts and by the way that they are infiltrating not only militaryadministrative functions but even specialised tactical and mission criticalsystems including the ACCS Army maneouvre control system, as well as ratherless publicised applications for the spooks at the Central IntelligenceAgency and National Security Agency.andP;  However, the installed base of personalcomputers now plays an important part in determining procurementspecifications; contracts such as the Desktop series have filled military andother agencies with personal computers and this is reflected in the need forUnix systems to adapt to MS-DOS in various ways.andP;  Links to MS-DOS computersand applications are a clear example; others are the ability to run Unix,OS/2 or MS-DOS on the same system (Desktop III) or, according to ComputerReseller News, even using Unix to multi-task MS-DOS applications under VP/ix(the $850m Federal Aviation Administration's OATS contract recently awardedto ATandamp;T).andP;  Of course, we should not really be talking about Unix inconnection with Government specifications at all, because the FederalInformation Processing Standard 151 Posix interface, rushed out by the USgovernment's standards body NIST after the DEC/Wang objection to the use ofthe ATandamp;T System V Interface Definition in the AFCAC 251 procurement, is usedin most Unix-type procurements.andP;  Posix is currently viewed as notcomprehensive enough to guarantee the compatibility and portability that theGovernment seeks, but the IEEE, NIST and procurement agencies are working onit; the Federal Information Processing Standard will be both enforced morefirmly and broadened in scope.andP;  To date, the Posix Federal Standard has beenbased on a draft specification but a revised specification based on finalisedIEEE specifications is imminent; according to NIST programme manager ShirleyRadack, adherence to this will be mandatory, after a six- month phase-inperiod.andP;  The catch? That this applies only where the procurement specifies &quot;aPosix-like interface&quot;.andP;  There's little dispute that Posix is being put towork, however.andP;  An Air Force spokesman indicated that for the AFCAC 300&quot;Superminis&quot; project currently approaching full Request For Procurement,compliance to the current Federal Standard covering Posix system calls wasrequired; and as the Standard is extended to cover other operating systemservices, so the suppliers will be required to update their products tocomply.andM;ViableandM;Posix falls into the Government's framework of procurement standardsalongside GOSIP, the Federal set of Open Systems Interconnectionspecifications.andP;  In an apparently aggressive timescale for the shift towardsthe seven-layer communications model, Version 1 of GOSIP - including OpenSystems file transfer and Electronic mail, X25, Ethernet and Token Ring -becomes mandatory from August this year.andP;  Again, use of GOSIP inspecifications is tempered with &quot;if it makes sense&quot;, said Radack.andP;  Inpractical terms, the US TCP/IP installed base is huge and few suppliers yethave viable Open Systems products.andP;  &quot;You could specify OSI&quot;, commented RogerCooper, a senior official at the Farmers' Home Administration, part of theDepartment of the Interior.andP;  &quot;But compared with TCP/IP, you probably wouldn'tget such a good competition&quot;.andP;  in the pipeline, will appear shortly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
