Mobil Corp. reported a 22 percent drop in first-quarter earningscompared with the same 1988 period, while Chevron Corp.'s profitwas down 52 percent and Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s fell 41percent. Shell Oil Co. said its profit slipped 7 percent.   Texaco said its profit rose more than fivefold to $1.5 billion,or $5.91 a share, from $270 million, or $1.11 a share, in the firstquarter of 1988.   Texaco's first-quarter results included a net restructuring gainof $1.2 billion, or $4.87 a share, the company said.   The nation's third-largest oil company, based in White Plains,N.Y., said it realized $1.3 billion from the sale of Texaco CanadaInc. after special charges. Texaco sold its 78 percent stake in theCanadian subsidiary to Exxon Corp. in January.   Texaco's revenue for the first three months of the year totaled$9.6 billion, up 10 percent from $8.7 billion in the year-agoquarter.   Despite the gains, Texaco's refining and marketing margins werehurt by rising crude oil prices in the absence of a correspondingincrease in product prices, the company said. However, domesticexploration and production results benefited from the higher crudeprices.   Mobil, based in New York, said its first-quarter earnings fellto $429 million, or $1.04 a share, from $549 million, or $1.33 ashare, in the comparable 1988 quarter.   Revenue totaled $14 billion, up slightly from $13.9 billion inlast year's first quarter.   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray attributed the profit decline tovolatile crude prices, which resulted in a 44 percent drop in thecompany's refining and marketing earnings. Exploration andproduction earnings were off 22 percent. However, Murray predictedthat a continued rise in product prices, including gasoline, couldproduce a turnaround in the second quarter.   San Francisco-based Chevron reported net income of $313 million,or 91 cents a share, down from $653 million, or $1.91 a share, inthe same period last year. Revenue totaled $7.7 billion, up from$7.5 billion.   Chevron Chairman Ken Derr noted that crude oil in November costabout $13 a barrel, but had risen to $20 a barrel by the end of thequarter. He said prices at the gas pump did not increase fastenough to make up the difference.   Occidental reported after-tax profit of $67 million, or 24 centsa share, down sharply from $113 million, or 52 cents a share. Saleswere $5.1 billion, compared with $4.5 billion in 1988's firstquarter.   The Los Angeles-based company said the 1988 results included anet gain of $53 million from the issuance and sale of stock by oneof its subsidiaries.   Occidental said the first-quarter results reflected the earlypaydown of $9 million in debt as well as a lower crude oil salesvolume stemming from the July 1988 North Sea Piper platformaccident.   Shell, a unit of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies basedin England and the Netherlands, said its U.S. consolidated earningsin the quarter were $362 million, down 7 percent from $390 millionin the year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $5.2 billion, up from$5.1 billion last year.   Sun Co.'s earnings for the first quarter increased 35 percent,the Radnor, Pa.-based company said, citing improved results indomestic refining and marketing.   Sun's profits totaled $81 million, or 76 cents a share, comparedwith $60 million, or 57 cents per share, in 1988's first quarter.Revenue totaled $2.65 billion, up from $2.39 billion.   Excluding $16 million in earnings reported in the first quarterof 1988 from domestic oil and gas operations that have since beenspun off to stockholders as Sun Exploration and Production Co.,Sun's earnings increased 84 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
