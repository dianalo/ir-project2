Today more than 1 million Zambians are threatened by famine, thegovernment can't pay its bills, and acute shortages of manysupplies keep even successful businesses operating at sharplyreduced capacities.   Zambia's economy has been in a downward spiral since themid-1970s, and Western economists say its ills have been largelyself-induced through bad policies and poor management.   Living standards have declined every year during the 1980s, andper capita income was $361 in 1988, only marginally higher thanwhen the British left, according to government statistics.   Inflation is at least 50 percent, unemployment is high andZambia's foreign debt of $5.5 billion is about twice its annualgross domestic product.   ``The government knows it has a serious problem, but itcontinues to create obstacles and display a hostile attitude towardmany businessess, especially small entrepreneurs,'' said aZambia-based Western economist who requested anonymity.   Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's president since independence, is aharsh critic of Western capitalism, but in 1985 he began aneconomic restructuring plan sponsored by the International MonetaryFund.   Kaunda slashed subsidies for a number of consumer goods,including corn meal, which many Zambians eat three times a day.Thousands of people rioted in December, 1986, leaving 15 dead.Kaunda responded by breaking relations with the IMF, leaving thelandlocked nation of 7.5 million even more desperate for foreignassistance.   The government has fixed prices for more than two years on suchbasic goods as corn meal, sugar, cooking oil and charcoal. Theresult has been widespread shortages and a bustling black market.   Every morning women line up outside supermarkets in Lusaka, thenbuy up scarce items within 30 minutes after the doors open. Somebuy more than they need and sell the extra on street corners atdouble what they paid.   Zambia is the world's fifth largest copper producer and lastyear prices were near an all-time high. But production problems anda lack of skilled workers and managers limited output to just over400,000 tons, well short of the goal of 500,000 tons and nowherenear the 720,000 tons gathered in 1969.   The country also had a record corn crop in 1988, but a largeportion rotted due to poor transportation. Truck drivers oftenrefuse to travel on unpaved rural roads because spare parts arescarce.   Chico, a cab driver in Lusaka, gave an example of what it's like.   ``If I need a spare tire I have a big problem,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 7</NOTE></DOC>
