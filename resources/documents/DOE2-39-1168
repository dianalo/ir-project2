<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-1168 </DOCNO><TEXT>An outline is given of the basic theory and techniques for channelingin combination with RBS, NRA and PIXE. The analysis of channeling resultsusing computer simulated data is described in some detail. In the simulationprogram many physical effects are taken into account, including the impact-parameterdependent energy loss of the ions. A number of examples of the analysisof measured angular scans with simulated data is given. 67 refs.; 24figs.</TEXT></DOC>
