<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0854 </DOCNO><TEXT>This paper describes the status of the three superconducting cyclotronswhich are in operation or under construction at the National SuperconductingCyclotron Laboratory. The oldest of these, the K500, has been in operationsince September 1982 supporting a national user program in heavy ionnuclear physics. A second large research cyclotron, the K800, is nownearing completion. This cyclotron will accelerate lighter heavy ionsto 200 MeV/nuc and heavier particles up to energies given by 1200 Q{sup2}/A MeV/nucleon. The magnet for this cyclotron came into operation inMay 1984 and has performed smoothly and reliably in three extended operatingperiods. At present, K800 construction activity centers on fabricationand installation of the rf system, the extraction system, and the ECRinjection line. The third NSCL superconducting cyclotron is a smaller50 MeV deuteron cyclotron to be used for neutron therapy in the radiationoncology center of a major Detroit hospital (Harper Hospital). Designfeatures of this small, application oriented, cyclotron are describedin some detail.</TEXT></DOC>
