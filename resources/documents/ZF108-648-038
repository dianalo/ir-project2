Xerox Corp. host-based, high-speed laser printersturn out completed policies in local offices.andM;Gammalink, Lotus Development Corp., Microrim, Microsoft Corp. and VermontCreative Software are among the software participants in the system.andP;  Valinorcreated a software product that allows fuller use of memory on the DOS-basedmachines.andP;  Domestic Brokerage handled the software for certainLAN-specialized nodes and for several insurance-specific applications,including one program that eases workers-compensation underwriting.andM;The system supports both the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and token-ring LANs.andO;Twisted-pair Ethernet, however, comprises most of the existing LAN installedbase.andM;LANs have been placed in AIG-DB's home office, regional offices and some ofthe branch offices that report to the regional facilities.andP;  All LANs in thesystem access mainframe databases via Rabbit Software Corp. gatewaysconnecting the LANs to AIG's backbone Systems Network Architecture (SNA) widearea network (WAN).andP;  The WAN is physically linked by dedicated TI lines.andM;Complex state regulationsandM;The driving forces behind Domestic Brokerage's strategy to offloadapplications from mainframes to desktop distributed-computing networks arebest explained in the context of how workers-compensation insurance policiesare put together.andM;&quot;Workers compensation is our most regulated line of business and, thus, onein which establishing premium rates is a complex process,&quot; says JohnHollinger, director for technology services in AIG's Brokerage DivisionInformation Services.andP;  Hollinger's team spearheaded planning and developmentof the new system.andP;  AIG believed that if workers-compensation policy writingcould be moved to smaller platforms, the same could be done for otherinsurance lines.&quot;andM;Workers-compensation underwriters must take into account an array of dataconcerning the client company's insurance needs, insurance history andgeneral business operations.andP;  In addition, an underwriter must considerworkers-compensation rules and regulations established by the industry'sNational Council of Compensation Insurance and by regulatory bodies in eachstate.andP;  These regulations, which change continually, establish the frameworkfor calculating premium rates for different types of insurance exposures.andM;There is one further complication.andP;  If the client maintains facilities inmore than one state, as many Domestic Brokerage customers do, itsworkers-compensation policy must be tailored to the regulations imposed byeach state on businesses within that state.andM;Client and regulatory information is maintained in the AIG host mainframes,which currently include IBM 3090/600s and 3084s.andP;  These mainframes runseveral operating systems.andM;The Multiple Virtual Storage/Extended Architecture (MVS/XA), for instance, isprimarily used for batch processing.andP;  The Customer Information Control System(CICS) and the Time Sharing Option/Interactive System Productivity Facility(TSO/ISPF) are used for on-line operations.andM;In the previous configuration, these machines were simply linked withterminals and PCs in field offices via the company's SNA network.andM;Underwriters faced the problem of gaining timely and accurate access tomainframe data for use in writing policies, especially during a period whenAIG-DB has experienced a rapid rise in the volume of policies issued.andO;Underwriters also needed a more convenient and consistent means of applyingthe data to policy preparation than the mainframe system offered.andM;One problem was that the old system was not designed with change in mind.andP;  Itworked well in a steady-state environment but not as efficiently when theturnover of information needed by underwriters became more rapid.andP;  Thus,AIG-DB required a system that would make current insurance informationquickly available to underwriters.andM;Processing  power  and  user friendliness were also important factors.andP;  &quot;Themainframe configuration was being brought to its knees by the amount ofapplications, the volume of data that needed processing and the number ofusers in the system,&quot; says Steve Bridges, manager of applications developmentin the Brokerage Division Information Services group.andP;  For instance, it couldtake up to 30 seconds for an underwriter to get a response from themainframes to an inquiry.andP;  That can be frustrating when you're trying to workyour way through a complex document.&quot;andM;Another issue: Policies are subject to alterations over their lifetimes,including out-of-sequence endorsements and later transactions with theclient.andP;  In the old system, these revisions were handled in an applicationenvironment different from that used to initially write the policy.andO;Underwriters wanted a consistent user interface throughout the life of apolicy.andM;In theory, some of these problems could have been addressed by adding moremainframes to the system.andP;  But AIG-DB didn't want to head further in thedirection of centralized information processing.andP;  The mainframes couldcontinue to function as repositories for corporate databases.andP;  DomesticBrokerage managers decided, however, that the most cost-effective way ofhandling such data would be over a LAN-based client-server system.andM;LANs to the rescueandM;In the new system, vital rating and client information would be updated andoffloaded from mainframes to the networks for processing by underwriters inlocal offices.andP;  Additionally, LANs were perceived as bringing such benefitsas a vastly improved user interface.andM;Example: &quot;You can reduce telecommunications costs by processing worklocally,&quot; says Hollinger.andP;  &quot;Moreover, when a mainframe goes down, allpolicies may be delayed and opportunities lost throughout the company.andP;  If aLAN crashes, only the workgroup involved feels the impact.andP;  And it's easierand takes less time to write applications in a LAN environment than in amainframe environment.&quot;andM;These considerations are compelling in retrospect.andP;  But the stakes involvedled AIG-DB to proceed cautiously in planning for a new system.andP;  &quot;It may bemore acceptable now to see LANs as the way to go, but that was not so clearthree years ago,&quot; says Hollinger.andM;T6 mitigate the risks involved in changing systems, Hollinger's team modeledits computing environment, established what was needed to support the localoffices, tested proposed vendor products to see if they fulfilled systemparameters and ran several pilot versions of the new system before moving tofull implementation.andM;&quot;When we had a product that functioned well, but still fell short of ourrequirements, we cooperated with the vendor to adapt the product to meet ourrequirements,&quot; says Hollinger.andP;  For example, he notes that LAN gateways hadto be completely compatible with SNA and with the high-level languageapplicationandM;program  interface (HLLAPI) that allows 3270 emulation by workstationprograms accessing mainframe applications.andM;Systems integrator Valinor was initially invited to make a presentation aboutavailable LAN components for the kind of system AIG-DB was contemplating.andO;Valinor was then taken on as a consultant to help demonstrate and evaluatenetwork products.andP;  The integrator was also involved in:andM;* Project planning;andM;* Application design;andM;* Quality-control testing;andM;* Definition of standard hardware and software parameters for the system.andM;And Valinor also located appropriate vendors for becoming partners withDomestic Brokerage and supplied most of the hardware and software for theproject.andM;&quot;As a result of this interaction, AIG-DB has installed many LANs andplatforms in a tightly controlled environment,&quot; says Bob Guaraldi, presidentof Valinor.andP;  &quot;This makes for stability throughout the networks when newproducts are rolled into the LAN environment.andP;  Moreover, our close technicalrelationship with Domestic Brokerage enabled their team to identify specificbusiness solutions, like the workers compensation program, that could beeconomically ported to LAN-based platforms.&quot;andM;LANs are largely configured around 3Com products.andP;  3Com was chosen becauseAIG-DB felt that 3Com had a stronger commitment than its competitors to IBMcompatibility.andM;Domestic Brokerage is currently considering migrating the LANs from 3Com's 3+ to 3 + Open LAN Manager as the network operating system.andP;  The latter wasdeveloped jointly by 3Com and Microsoft and is interoperable with both IBM'sLAN server and Microsoft's OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  Capabilities of 3 + Open LANManager include connection of DOS and OS/2 workstations and support ofcommunications across such environments as IBM, Unix and transmission controlprotocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP).andM;AIG-DB is also considering migrating its servers.andP;  Servers in each LAN nowconsist of 3Com's 3Server/200 series of 80186 machines.andP;  Domestic Brokerageis looking at the 3Server/500 family of 80386 20-MHz devices as a possibleupgrade.andP;  &quot;We like this box because it was designed from the start to be aserver,&quot; says Hollinger.andP;  &quot;A PC of equivalent speed, loaded down withmonitors, disk drives and keyboards, would not have as much memory availablefor network functions as 3Com's machine.&quot;andM;3Com contributes its 80286-based 3Station family of diskless workstations atthe client end of the system.andP;  AIG-DB views the diskless workstation asquiet, small and easy to maintain.andP;  Configurations of these computers can beupdated rapidly to take advantage of new versions of the network operatingsystem.andP;  And there are also security benefits.andP;  As the company sees it, youdon't have to worry about changes being made to databases on a disklessmachine.andM;Several 3Com server-based programs ease advanced networking features on thesystem.andP;  For instance, 3 + Share 386 provides file management, printerspooling and network-administration functions for workstations.andM;And 3 + Name determines who can get into the system and the location ofnetwork resources; 3 + Start boots all diskless workstations from the networkserver; and 3 + Backup automatically provides centralized, unattended tapebackup for servers.andP;  Equivalent versions of these packages are available on 3+ Open.andM;Domestic Brokerage was concerned about the relatively limited 640K bytes ofRAM available on DOS machines for application code.andP;  Two software packagescope with this problem.andM;1.andP;  Valinor's High Stepper uses the DOS computer's reserved memory area,which extends from 640K bytes to 1M byte.andP;  This area is only partly filled bythe operating system.andP;  High Stepper loads several types of applications intothis area, including LAN board and NetBIOS drivers and desktop-accessoryRAM-resident programs.andM;2.andP;  Data Communication Link (DCL) software from AIG-DB implements suchfunctions as data compression, navigation-to-the-host and recovery/restore.andO;A portion of DCL resides on a dedicated workstation in each LAN, rather thanon individual desktop machines.andP;  The other portion runs on the mainframe CICSenvironment.andM;Rabbit Software's IBM-compatible HLLAPI Rabbitgate undertakes protocoltranslation between LANs and mainframes.andP;  And Rabbitgate is supplemented byDCL.andM;Besides saving some workstation space, this arrangement emulates the essenceof IBM's SNA LU 6.2 protocol.andP;  LU 6.2 eases Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications (APPC) among hosts and workstations.andP;  APPC capabilities werenot widely available when AIG-DB's project was underway.andM;Rabbitgate and DCL are examples of specialized nodes used in the LANenvironment.andP;  Several other such nodes are also in place.andP;  The LAN Job EntrySystem (LJES), for example, permits off-hours scheduling of batch jobs on theLAN without tying up workstations.andP;  And the Remote Operations Support System(ROSS) monitors the condition of LAN components.andP;  In addition, the PCAnywherenode is used for remote dial-in to the LAN for diagnostic support and bybranch offices not large enough for their own LANs.andM;Domestic Brokerage underwriters have access to several off-the-shelfapplications on the LANs, including Gammalink's Gammafax PC, Lotus' 1-2-3,Microrim's R:BASE, Microsoft's Word and Excel and 3Com's 3+Mail, which allowsfacsimile messages to be sent from workstation screens.andM;It is AIG-DB's distributed-processing insurance policy applications, however,that form the heart of the system.andP;  SYSTEMS INTEGRATION visited both theDomestic Brokerage Information Services research facility in Manchester,N.H., and the company's Boston Regional Office to see how one of theseapplications-the workers-compensation program-is carried out.andM;The workers-compensation system incorporates both mainframe and workstationcomponents, including a Windows package from Vermont Creative Software at theworkstation level and Raima Corp.'s db-VISTA database management system(DBMS) in the mainframe CICS environment.andP;  A LAN specialized node calledLockmanager locks in database files transmitted from db-VISTA for LANprocessing.andM;An underwriter must first reserve an account for himself before starting workon a policy.andP;  &quot;AIG is a big company, and we need to ensure that underwritersin different divisions are not competing for the same business,&quot; says JimCarlson, regional administration manager in Boston.andP;  The underwriter doesthis by sending a notice from his workstation to the Submission Processingand Reservation System (SPARS) on the mainframes via the DCL and gatewaynodes.andM;Underwriters proceed by entering such data as a client's name and fieldoffices, the issuing office, the type of policy desired, occupations ofemployees to be insured, policy limits and waivers, expiration dates, ratingplans and states in which insurance exposures will occur on a series ofscreens presented by the program.andM;Some of this account information can be brought into the LAN environment fromthe mainframe database and stored on the servers for up to a year before itis purged from a given locality.andP;  &quot;In effect, underwriters use the LAN as ascratch pad during policy preparation,&quot; says Dick Lucy, systems manager ofthe AIG-DB's Information Services staff.andM;Mainframes store premium ratesandM;The premiums are calculated by algorithms on the basis of theworkers-compensation regulations established by each state.andP;  The premiumrates are stored in the mainframes in the form of rating tables applicable todifferent types of policy options.andP;  These tables are constantly updated.andM;Changes in the tables are automatically downloaded through LAN gateways intoservers several times each day so that underwriters have the latest availableinformation.andP;  Downloading is initiated by requests placed by the LJESbatch-processing node to the DCL, which then contacts the mainframes.andM;The underwriter's task is not as standardized as this description may make itsound.andP;  &quot;In general, the premium equals the type of exposure times the rate,but there can be many exceptions to this principle,&quot; says Lucy.andP;  &quot;Moreover,underwriters often prepare multiple insurance premiums based on differentversions of a policy for the client to examine.&quot;andM;When negotiations with a client are completed, the underwriter informs themainframe database that a policy is booked.andP;  The policy itself is uploaded tothe mainframes, which produce policy jackets and forms for printing in thelocal office.andP;  [DIAGRAM OMITTED] Valinor profileandM;* Employees: 40andM;* Revenues: $12 millionandM;Valinor Inc. was established in 1982 as a reseller, consultant and systemsintegrator for LAN-related products.andP;
