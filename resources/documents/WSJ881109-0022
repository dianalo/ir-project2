Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans voted yesterday for a man -- but not a message.    The closer-than-expected presidential race reflected a lack of clear consensus among the voters about the direction the new president should take, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls of voters as they left their polling places. The surveys found no clear idea in voters' minds about what either candidate actually would do as president.    Although Republican Vice President George Bush had held a commanding lead in polls throughout the general election campaign, it seemed clear that in the final analysis voters were unwilling to give him a sweeping mandate. A major factor in Mr. Bush's slippage at the end of the campaign was the decision of a majority of Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 to vote for Michael Dukakis yesterday, according to the survey. Apparently this reflected the strong economic populist theme that the Massachusetts governor sounded in the waning days.    The results suggest that Mr. Bush may have a tough time marshaling the kind of broad public support that propelled the early days of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Rather, he will be facing a public that clearly wants some pressing problems addressed but doesn't have much faith he shares its objectives.    Half the public, for example, thinks reducing the budget deficit should be the next president's top priority. Yet despite the desire to see the federal budget deficit attacked, there wasn't any consensus about how to solve the problem: 39% thought it would be necessary for the new president to raise taxes to reduce the deficit, while 44% said it wouldn't be needed and 17% said they weren't sure.    Moreover, only one in four voters thinks either candidate would actually make reducing the deficit his chief goal.    The Journal/NBC poll indicated that Mr. Bush earned his margin early in the campaign: the earlier voters made up their minds, the more likely they were to go for the vice president. By contrast, Mr. Dukakis did much better among those who made up their minds at the end of the campaign. Among the two-thirds of voters who made up their minds more than a month ago, 55% went for Mr. Bush. Twenty percent of the electorate decided who to vote for in the last week of the campaign. Of those, 59% went for Mr. Dukakis.    The poll suggested the continued existence of a gender gap in the support of the two candidates, with Mr. Bush running about eight percentage points stronger among men than among women. And despite disenchantment with Mr. Dukakis among many black leaders, the poll indicated that those blacks who voted did so overwhelmingly for the Democrat.    There was little to suggest that voters thought either man agreed with them. When they were asked what issue they thought either candidate's top priority actually would be, more people said &quot;not sure&quot; than chose any alternative. Thus, it will be hard for the new president to claim that people voted for him to tackle any one issue.    Indeed, voters offered no clear rationale based on issues for why they voted the way they did. Asked to choose among six possible reasons to explain their vote for president -- economy and taxes, domestic issues, national security, values, competence and experience, and dislike of the other candidate -- no option garnered the support of more than one in five voters. Roughly as many people said their prime reason was dislike of the other candidate as cited the economy and taxes.    Similarly, the survey showed there was no broad agreement among voters on issues ranging from day care for children of working parents to defense spending. About 46% of those questioned thought next year's Pentagon budget should be about the same as this year's, while about 36% thought it should be less. Only 14% thought it should be bigger.    By contrast, in January 1981 two-thirds of those questioned wanted more military spending.    Still, there appeared to be substantial agreement on some issues. Nearly 80% yesterday agreed that the new president should seek further arms reductions with the Soviet Union. Similarly, even if it meant higher taxes, 72% thought the new president should do more to protect the environment, and 69% agreed that he should do more to ensure that all Americans have adequate health care.    While a majority of voters approved of Ronald Reagan's performance as president, the poll showed no overwhelming desire to hew to the course he has laid out. Indeed, a majority of voters agreed with the statement that &quot;I don't like a lot of what's going on these days,&quot; and hope that the new president &quot;changes direction.&quot; A little over four in 10 voters disagreed, saying that they approve of the direction the country has been moving in and hope the new president &quot;continues along the same track.&quot;    Similarly, voters were narrowly split on the question of whether they believe they have personally benefited from the economic policies of the Reagan administration.    Those two questions help explain the gender gap between the two candidates. The poll found that women were substantially more likely than men to feel that they hadn't benefited from Ronald Reagan's economic policies and were also more likely to want a change in direction.    As Mr. Reagan's vice president, Mr. Bush inherited an overwhelming margin among those voters who want to stay on the current national course, the Journal/NBC polls showed. But the survey also indicated that Mr. Bush was gaining the support of somewhere around one in five of those voters who want a change.    Bush and Dukakis voters had markedly different reasons for casting their ballots the way they did, the Journal/NBC polls found. For the vice president, the most frequently cited reasons were his competence and experience, his stand on defense issues and his position on the economy and taxes.    For Mr. Dukakis, the overwhelming attraction was his stand on domestic issues such as education and health. The second most-often cited reason: dislike of the opposing ticket.    The Journal/NBC survey also found that Bush and Dukakis voters viewed their candidates in markedly different ways. When asked what personal characteristic best described the candidate they just voted for, &quot;smart&quot; was the first choice of both sets of supporters. But twice as many Bush voters said their man was &quot;tough,&quot; while three times more Dukakis voters described their man as &quot;caring.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
