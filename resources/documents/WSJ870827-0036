In recommending the civil fine, which may be adjusted during an appeals process, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority alleged that a Pandamp;G plant in Quincy, Mass., has illegally dumped pollutants, including toxic chemicals, oil, grease and heavy metals, into sewers since 1985.    Such pollutants, which overwhelm Boston's antiquated sewage-treatment facilities, are discharged into coastal waters and have helped make the harbor the nation's most polluted, said state officials.    Cutting industrial pollutants dumped into sewers &quot;is an essential part of cleaning up Boston Harbor,&quot; said Paul Levy, who was named executive director of the state water authority earlier this month. &quot;The pollutants clog up sewage treatment plants, and contamination with heavy metals prevents us from using the sludge for agricultural purposes.&quot;    Mr. Levy asserted that the Pandamp;G plant, which makes soap and industrial chemicals and detergents, is &quot;clearly a major problem, and we have received a number of complaints from city officials about it.&quot; He said his agency is beefing up staff to monitor industrial effluents and probably will fine other companies in coming months.    In Cincinnati, a spokesman for Pandamp;G, a consumer products concern, declined to comment on whether the company will appeal. The spokesman said the agency had notified the company of the alleged violations.    &quot;We were surprised by the action because our technical people were in ongoing communication with . . . (the agency), and we felt we were working with it to find a solution,&quot; the spokesman said.    Mr. Levy said the company may appeal within the water authority. If unsuccessful, it may carry its appeal to state court.    Environmental Protection Agency officials hailed the Massachusetts action as an important part of a long-term plan to clean up the harbor.    Two years ago, the federal agency obtained a court-ordered timetable for the cleanup, which calls for an estimated $3 billion overhaul of Boston's sewage treatment system by 1999. But the state water authority, created in 1985 partly to oversee the harbor cleanup, has had little success in cutting industrial pollutants dumped into city sewers, according to Paul Keough, an EPA official in Boston.    &quot;For years, this was a neglected area of pollution control in Boston,&quot; he said. &quot;Five-thousand-plus companies are discharging into Boston's sewers, and until now their general attitude has been that they have little to fear&quot; from the water authority.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pandamp;G closed at $99.75 a share, down $1.375. </TEXT></DOC>
