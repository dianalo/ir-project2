The strike is affecting Boeing plants in the Seattle area;Wichita, Kan.; Portland, Ore.; and several other sites.   In Wichita, where Boeing Military Airplanes has itsheadquarters, hundreds of strikers rallied Monday before joiningpickets for a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was asimilar rally in Everett, Wash., where the popular 747s and 767sare built.   One Wichita hourly employee who has been crossing picket linesreported his car was vandalized during the weekend. Local strikecoordinator Ray Briggs said the union doesn't sanction propertydamage or injury and that there is no proof the vandalism happenedbecause of the strike.   Baker dismissed the Teamsters' decision to cross picket lines,saying that wouldn't affect the 57,800 striking Machinists' abilityto halt production at the world's largest commercial jet builder.   Boeing officials were in a meeting Monday and did notimmediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.Federal mediator Doug Hammond left a recording on his answeringmachine saying no talks were scheduled.   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike beganWednesday. Before the strike, Boeing was committed to delivering 57jets before the end of the year. Five consecutive years of recordorders have given the company a backlog that stretches into thelate 1990s.   That backlog and the steady stream of overtime which employeeshave been asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for betterwages and less overtime.   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for thefirst half of 1989, and had profits of $614 million on sales of$16.96 billion in 1988.   Boeing's offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in1990. Mandatory overtime would be reduced from 200 hours perquarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula would beimproved to account for virtually all inflation.   Boeing said a machinist in a middle skill grade, such as anengine mechanic, could see pay go from $34,389 this year to $43,138in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, butexcluding $13,000 in bonuses and any overtime.   The Machinists, who have seen bonuses but no increases in theirbase wage for six years, said that was not enough.   ``They need airplanes delivered and we want to get back anddeliver them. But we want our fair share and that's what we'reatempting to get,'' Baker said.   It is the Machinists' first strike against Boeing since a 45-daywalkout in 1977.   What happens at Boeing could affect labor talks at otheraerospace plants. Talks have been extended in a Machinists contractthat expired Sunday with Lockheed Corp. in Marietta, Ga. Theunion's contract with McDonnell Douglas expires Oct. 22.</TEXT></DOC>
