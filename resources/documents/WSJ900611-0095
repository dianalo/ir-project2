As better treatments succeed in repelling infections,patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome may survivethe once life-threatening episodes of pneumonia and othersicknesses to live years longer than they once did. However,the erosion of their immune system leaves them vulnerable toa virulent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of theB-cells produced in the body's lymph nodes.</LP><TEXT>   The trend represents a major shift in the course of theepidemic and a setback for the group that previously hadembodied the most hope -- those patients who were long-termsurvivors. Meanwhile, what role the drug AZT may play in thedevelopment of lymphoma is unclear, suggesting a newdirection for future AIDS research. Questions surrounding thedrug, which is made by Wellcome PLC, London, are sure toprovoke debate, especially from gay activists who feel AZThas unfairly dominated the nation's research agenda. Effortsto reach a Wellcome spokesman were unsuccessful over theweekend.   Doctors at major AIDS centers are reporting a steep surgein the number of AIDS-related lymphoma cases this year. &quot;Inthe first three months of 1990, we've more than doubled therate from prior years,&quot; says Lawrence Kaplan, of theUniversity of California at San Francisco. &quot;It's anextraordinary number of what we think of as a fairly unusualdisease.&quot;   At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, almost 10% ofadvanced AIDS patients develop the lymphoma -- virtually allof them while taking the drug AZT. Other centers see more,increasing with length of diagnosis and time on AZT.   The trend &quot;is real and important. It represents theclinical evolution of AIDS,&quot; says Jerome E. Groopman of theDeaconess Hospital. Where patients once succumbed after aswift bout of pneumonia, AZT plus aerosol pentamidine andother drugs now allay the acute danger of death frominfection, he says. Now, doctors see more chronicneurological problems, and a wasting syndrome, but the moststriking new feature is the lymphoma, Dr. Groopman says.&quot;AIDS is a changing disease,&quot; Dr. Groopman cautions. &quot;We haveto be flexible and ready to address new clinical events asthey arise.&quot;   Cancer has been associated with AIDS from the start.Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a tumor of blood vessels, was theearliest AIDS-linked malignancy to appear, but its incidencehas declined while lymphoma's has surged. In San Francisco,for example, KS cases grew at a 2% annual rate in 1986 and1987, the most recent years for which figures are available,while lymphoma cases soared 48%, according to a reportpublished last week by the National Cancer Institute.   Moreover, cancer is a risk for anyone with a weakenedimmune system. People who receive organ transplants run aheightened risk of cancer due to the immunosuppressive drugsthey take to prevent transplant rejection. Children withcongenital diseases like SCID (severe combined immunedeficiency) also develop more than their share of tumors.   Studies in the U.S. show lymphoma also is on the rise inelderly men for unknown reasons, possibly due to herbicidesor other environmental factors, says Robert Yarchoan, asenior scientist at the National Cancer Institute.   Still, the rate of AIDS lymphoma -- now approaching 20% ormore for the most advanced patients on AZT -- is two to threetimes the expected rate of such cancer in other immunedeficiencies, and even in early AIDS.   &quot;The critical question is whether AZT is acting to enhancethe lymphoma, or whether the lymphoma is the outcome of aprolonged immune deficiency,&quot; says Dr. Groopman. &quot;Clearly,people with AIDS develop lymphoma even when they aren'ttaking AZT, as do people with organ transplants.&quot;   The mystery of AIDS lymphoma may involve several factorsacting in concert to set the stage for cancer: AIDS, anothermicrobe, and genetic damage.   About half of the AIDS lymphoma tumors contain a secondvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes family thatis already implicated in certain other cancers, Dr. Groopmansays.   Other AIDS lymphomas contain evidence of genetic damage:breaks in certain chromosomes, or expression of an oncogene,or cancer-promoting gene, called &quot;myc.&quot;   &quot;You might see that a patient today living four years withAIDS -- in contrast with someone in 1984 who lived two years-- might have more such chromosomal damage,&quot; Dr. Groopmansaid. &quot;My gut feeling is that it's not AZT,&quot; he added, but heplans further studies to investigate the drug's possiblerole.   AZT has been reported to cause vaginal tumors in rodents,but &quot;We think that's a different mechanism,&quot; Dr. Yarchoan ofthe cancer institute said. Such a rise in vaginal tumorshasn't been reported among women on AZT.   Dr. Kaplan of San Francisco suggests that a potential clueto lymphoma's origin lies in one of the very first visiblesymptoms of AIDS infection: swollen lymph nodes.   &quot;Those lymph nodes are swollen because B-cells are goingwild,&quot; he says. &quot;They're hyperactive and proliferating, sothat they can make antibodies to the AIDS virus. When youhave a patient in that situation, it stands to reason thatthe longer their B-cells are proliferating, the greater thechance that some second event will come along -- either asecond virus, or a spontaneous genetic {mutation}.&quot;   By Dr. Kaplan's reckoning, AZT contributes only &quot;in anextremely roundabout way, by making people live longer sothey get these malignancies.&quot;   Whatever the cause or causes, the prognosis for patientswith AIDS lymphoma is poor, with an average survival time ofabout six months. Treatment so far is limited to theconventional array of anticancer drugs. Many patients,however, are too ill to withstand the rigors of chemotherapy,because their bone marrow is depleted by the disease or byAZT. Dr. Groopman's clinic has three patients in completeremission, who are alive three years after treatment of theirlymphoma, but more often the cancer recurs, he says.   &quot;In the worst-case scenario, we often see a situation likethat with Burkitt's lymphoma, where tumors double in sizeovernight,&quot; says Dr. Kaplan. &quot;You see a patient, and the nextday, his tumor has grown visibly.&quot;   &quot;They are very aggressive tumors, found in the brain,lung, and gastrointestinal tract,&quot; says Dr. Yarchoan. Unlikeclassic B-cell lymphomas, which often crop up in the lymphnodes, AIDS lymphomas often hide in the brain where theirsymptoms may be mistaken for AIDS dementia, which is oftencaused by toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection.   &quot;It's not uncommon for the lymphoma to be undiagnosed,&quot;says Parkash Gill, of the University of California MedicalSchool in Los Angeles. &quot;So for many cases, it may beunreported.&quot;   Experts are bracing for a rise in the number of lymphomacases. &quot;I believe we'll see more of these cases as a resultof antiretroviral therapy, and treatment of opportunisticinfections,&quot; Dr. Yarchoan agrees, adding that he and hiscolleagues at the cancer institute are analyzing AIDSpatients who developed lymphoma while participating intreatment studies.</TEXT></DOC>
