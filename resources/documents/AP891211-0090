Oscar Santamaria, the Salvadoran justice minister, told TheAssociated Press in an interview he is optimistic about the outcomeof the two-day summit by the region's five presidents scheduled toend tonight.   ``Last night we clarified various positions and, if everythinggoes on like this, it is possible that at the end of the meeting wemay announce the normalization of relations with Nicaragua,'' saidSantamaria, a member of his country's delegation.   Santamaria said the presidents, in principle, agreed to issue astatement condemning leftist guerrilla attacks in El Salvador,which was part of an all-out offensive the rebels launched Nov. 11.   But he said the statement would not use the term ``terrorist''in condmenning the rebels, apparently at the request of Nicaragua'sPresident Daniel Ortega. But Santamaria refused to go into details,other than indicate all five countries are seeking greater U.N.involvment to settle the two wars.   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani suspended diplomaticrelations with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government Nov. 26,one day after two planes that crashed in El Salvador were found tohave been carrying Soviet surface-to-air missiles for the rebels.   Meanwhile, Ortega is seeking agreement to allow U.N. observersmore power and personnel to start disbanding the U.S.-backed Contrarebels, a source said.   For its part, El Salvador rejected a cease-fire proposal by theleftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,whose offensive was the largest of the decade-old civil war.   Under the Nicaraguan plan, the government would considerresuming its cease-fire and ``technical talks'' with the leadershipof the Honduras-based rebels after the Contra force is disbanded,the Nicaraguan source said on condition of anonymity.   ``The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,''said Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, referring to anAug. 7 regional peace agreement under which the guerrillas were tohave been disbanded last week. ``The United Nations must begin tofunction in Nicaragua.''   The source said Nicaragua was not optimistic about gettingContra camps in Honduras dismantled because Washington wants tokeep the Contras alive to ensure Nicaragua's Feb. 25 presidentialelections are free and clean.   Nicaragua's government insists the presidents follow through ontheir agreement that the Contras be demobilized.   A U.N. observer group has been sent to the region to verify theContra repatriation and to make sure no weapons are sent from onecountry in the region to another's insurgents.   The Salvadoran rebel cease-fire proposal was presented byNicaragua and rejected by the Salvadoran government, which hadoffered a possible resumption of talks with the rebels if they stopguerrilla activities in cities.   The Salvadoran guerrillas also asked for the dismissal of sevenhigh-ranking military leaders in El Salvador and ``full respect forhuman rights and democratic liberties of political and socialorganizations.''   At the same time, Costa Rica proposed a truce in El Salvadorfrom Tuesday through Jan. 15 to give both sides in El Salvador timeto begin negotiations for a permanent cease-fire. Costa Rica alsoproposed that the United Nations be given powers to verify theproposed truce.   The five presidents are meeting for the sixth time in 28 monthsin their search for a peaceful solution to regional conflicts. Theyare Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador,Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and OscarArias of Costa Rica.   Frustration and pessimism prevailed as the summit took placeamid what Arias called ``the most difficult moment'' since thepeace negotiations began.   El Salvador accuses Nicaragua of sending missiles to theSalvadoran rebels, while Nicaragua accuses El Salvador and Hondurasof siding with the United States and helping the Contras.   The role of the United States and that of the Soviet Union werealso brought up at the meeting.   Costa Rica's foreign minister, Rodrigo Madrigal, acknowledgedthat regional agreements will not have much validity if thesuperpowers do not support peace and the conflicting parties haveclose ties to them.   Arias, who created the region's original peace plan, on Saturdaycalled the United States and Soviet Union ``two-faced'' and accusedthem of speaking about peaceful solutions while encouragingmilitary activities.   The United States provides aid to the Contras and the governmentof El Salvador in its fight against leftist rebels backed byNicaragua and, at least indirectly, by the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
