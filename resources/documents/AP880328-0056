(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Howard Rollins Jr., co-star of the NBCseries ``Heat of the Night,'' was arrested on drug and trafficcharges after being stopped for going more than 100 mph on aninterstate, authorities said.   A state trooper who stopped the actor early Sunday said he foundtwo bags of a rock-like substance suspected of being cocaine inRollins' coat pockets. Rollins' blood alcohol level also was abovethe legal limit for intoxication, according to a breath test, hesaid.   The actor was charged with possessing cocaine, first-offensedrunken driving and speeding, and was released on $5,000 bond.   There was no answer to a telephone call to Rollins' room at theHammond Holiday Inn.   Rollins, who co-starred as Chief of Detectives Virgil Tibbs inthe two-hour television remake of ``Heat of the Night'' and in asix-part series of the same name, had a commission as a sheriff'sdeputy, said Senior Trooper Allen Coburn, who arrested the actor.   ``He had a badge holder with a Livingston Parish Sheriff'sOffice badge and a full commission from the sheriff,'' Coburn said.``He didn't say anything about it, but he made sure I saw it whilehe was getting his driver's license.''   Rollins, 37, of Baltimore, told police he was in Hammond to makea movie. ``Heat of the Night'' was filmed in Hammond.   Coburn said he spotted Rollins' car traveling east on Interstate12 at a little over 100 mph. Rollins pulled his car to the side ofthe interstate and offered no resistance, Coburn said.   ``He took his coat off while doing the sobriety test. After thetest, I picked up the coat, checked the pockets for weapons andfound two bags of suspected cocaine,'' Coburn said. Each bagappeared to hold about one-eighth of an ounce of a rock-likesubstance, he said.   Coburn said a breath test indicated that Rollins' blood alcohollevel was 0.15 percent. The law sets intoxication as 0.10 percentor more.   Rollins' court date probably will be set in six to eight weeks.   In addition to ``Heat of the Night,'' in which Carroll O'Connorco-stars, Rollins' films include ``Ragtime'' in 1981, in which hewas nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and``A Soldier's Story'' in 1984.   In 1985, Rollins starred as a ruthless cocaine dealer in thetelevision movie ``The Children of Times Square.''</TEXT></DOC>
