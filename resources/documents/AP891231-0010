LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawmakers hissed, jeered, shouted andyelled Sunday during the long-awaited testimony of disgraced formerpresident Chun Doo-hwan as he testified in Parliament after 13months in self-imposed exile.   ``Is killing innocent people an exercise in self-defense?''yelled opposition lawmakers when Chun denied involvement in a 1980civil uprising.   Kim Young-bae, a national opposition legislator, marched to amicrophone and said for hundreds of thousands to hear ontelevision, ``The contents of his testimony and attitude areincurring the wrath of the people.''   Kim Dae-jung, a two-time presidential candidate and oppositionparty leader who was sentenced to death under Chun's rule foralleged sedition, was among 200 legislators and spectators at theNational Assembly.   President Roh Tae-woo appealed to citizens in a New Year'smessage Sunday ``to put an end to past affairs once the pastpresident apologizes for wrong-doings.''   But by mid-afternoon, newspapers and television stations saidthey were flooded with calls protesting Chun's testimony asdisappointing and angry that he had not apologized. The committeechairman said political party offices also had been deluged byangry telephone callers.   Chun returned to Seoul from a remote Buddhist temple earlySunday to testify on alleged corruption, human rights abuses andmisconduct during his seven years in office that ended in early1988.   There have been widespread public demands to make the truthknown about alleged misdeeds of Chun's authoritarian rule to clearthe way for more open government and more democratic reform.   Thousands of riot police were deployed around the Parliamentbuilding and in nearby streets to prevent attacks by radicals andstudents who have staged violent demonstrations demanding Chun bearrested and punished, but there were no clashes.   Chun, a former general, took power with military backing in1980. He has denied any personal corruption but 48 of his friendsand relatives have been tried and convicted of embezzlement andother crimes.   The 58-year-old Chun, looking somber, occasionally biting histongue and growing more weary as the hearings went on into thenight, said ``the president of a nation is bound to take unlimitedresponsibility for the state of affairs during his tenure.''   Chun did not make an outright apology, as some politicans havedemanded, but said he would take ``moral responsibility'' formisdeeds under his administration. ``I didn't do anything wrong,''Chun said.   Legislators were outraged when Chun said he had not beeninvolved in the uprising which left 200 dead and at least 1,500people injured in the southern city of Kwangju. Chun said he wasout of line of command.   ``Marshall law authorities at that time gave troops on the scenethe discretion to open fire if they faced a war situation,'' hesaid.   ``Testify! Testify!'' lawmakers shouted.   Some opposition leaders believe the Kwangju incident was ascheme by Chun and his associates to seize power in the chaoticdays that followed the assassination of President Park Chung-hee inlate 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
