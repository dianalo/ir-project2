So why did the small 18-year-old leveraged buy-out firm vault into the realm of the megadeal with its $2.5 billion agreement to acquire American Standard Inc.?    Blame it on the ESOP.    The private New York investment bank pioneered the concept of using employee stock option plans, or ESOPs, to take companies private. But its largest deal until now was the 1984 buy-out of Blue Bell Inc. for $658 million. And the total value of the 26 deals the firm has completed since 1980 amounts to $2.89 billion.    Kelso's agreement for the acquisition of American Standard doesn't involve using an ESOP to take the company private. But what first piqued Kelso's interest was an ESOP that American Standard incorporated into its earlier recapitalization plan designed to fend off Black andamp; Decker Corp.'s takeover bid.    &quot;We certainly liked the basic businesses at American Standard,&quot; says Joseph S. Schuchert, Kelso's 58-year-old managing partner. &quot;When we saw their proposed recapitalization with its ESOP, we saw that the end result would have had the characteristics of the leveraged buy-outs we do.&quot;    When American Standard decided to put itself on the auction block, Mr. Schuchert says, &quot;We knocked on the door and asked to be let in.&quot;    Kelso and American Standard were known to each other before this deal. In 1986, Kelso bought Mosler Safe Co., a security systems company, and Lebanon Valley Offset, a commercial printing company, from American Standard for a total of $182 million.    Those transactions gave the firm an edge over Black andamp; Decker or other potential bidders for American Standard. &quot;Kelso had an inside track because they knew management and presumably had a good relationship with them,&quot; said one person familiar with American Standard. &quot;I won't say they were preferred, but they were welcomed.&quot;    Kelso's own capital clout is small compared with leveraged buy-out firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. that control billion-dollar funds. Kelso declined to divulge the size of the investment funds it controls, but one source said they amount to only about $126 million. People familiar with Kelso, however, say the firm has been able to masterfully leverage its own capital and that of other investors.    &quot;They have built quite enviable rates of return on their deals and have a group of very happy investors,&quot; says James Zukin, a principal in Los Angeles-based Houlihan, Lokey, Howard andamp; Zukin, a leading ESOP and merger adviser.    Part of Kelso's success is due in part to the relationships it has built up with some of Wall Street's biggest players. First Boston Corp., which is providing a $900 million bridge loan for the American Standard deal, is Kelso's longtime investment banker. Bankers Trust Co., which is assembling $1.8 billion in bank financing on the American Standard transaction, also has a long-term relationship with Kelso.    Since 1974 companies have been encouraged by federal law to subsidize their employees' stock purchases; up to a certain limit, a company can deduct from its taxable earnings the money it puts into an ESOP.    But leveraged buy-outs financed by ESOPs have been criticized by some in Washington who feel that they are tax-driven strategies that benefit managers more than workers. Kelso has come in for much of the scrutiny.    In 1983, for example, the Labor Department, delayed for three months a Kelso-structured $219 million ESOP buy-out of Raymond International Inc., a Houston engineering concern. The Labor Department was concerned because Raymond's management used employee benefit plans to reduce the cost of the buy-out in ways that would harm future pension funding. In 1985, a leveraged ESOP agreement with Scott andamp; Fetzer Co., a manufacturer, fell through after the Labor Department expressed concerns.    Mr. Schuchert vehemently disagrees with critics of ESOP financed leveraged buy-outs whom he asserts don't understand them. But the firm stopped doing leveraged ESOP deals after the Scott andamp; Fetzer incident, pending regulatory clarification, which has yet to occur.    &quot;Kelso created the ESOP niche in LBO context,&quot; says Houlihan Lokey's Mr. Zukin, &quot;so it was a very tough decision they made not to use leveraged ESOP in deals.&quot;    Louis Kelso, the firm's founder and creator of the ESOP deals, is no longer actively involved in Kelso's business. The real powers at the seven-professional firm are Mr. Schuchert and Frank T. Nickell, another partner. Mr. Schuchert was a corporate lawyer before joining Kelso. He is described as being able to work well with companies' directors and top management and skilled at bringing in the business. Mr. Nickell, a certified public accountant, is described as your consummate Mr. Inside, the one who makes sure the deals are properly structured.    Says Mr. Zukin: &quot;Schuchert stirs up the pot, Nickell makes sure it tastes right.&quot;    Mr. Schuchert doesn't see Kelso trying to do more megadeals -- those over $1 billion. But he acknowledges that undertaking American Standard &quot;demonstrates that in the right situation we could finance this size deal.&quot;    Mr. Schuchert also isn't too concerned that Black andamp; Decker will try to make another run at American Standard. &quot;They'd have to come back with a pretty big increase (over $78) to do that,&quot; he says. Moreover, Kelso says that it has access to additional financing should the price for American Standard leap once again.    Mr. Schuchert says he plans to keep American Standard's businesses and increase beyond 20% the stake that the ESOP created by agreement would own. &quot;We want to own the businesses that are good and solid, not sell them off,&quot; he says. &quot;We feel that if you're going to make employees owners, make them first-class owners of first-class companies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
