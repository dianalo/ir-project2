In addition, they will have to carry a general warning that``Tobacco Seriously Damages Health'' which will also have to becarried by products such as pipe tobacco.   ``Smoking Causes Cancer,'' ``Smoking Causes Fatal Diseases,''``Pregnant Women, Smoking Harms Your Baby'' and ``Smokers DieYounger'' are some of the specific warnings which will have toappear on cigarette packs.   Ministers from the 12 EEC member states also agreed at a meetingon Tuesday that the warnings should be clear and legible, printedin bold letters and should not be printed on external wrappers orwhere they would be damaged when the package is opened.   The new law specified that the warning must cover at least 4percent of the packet in countries where there is one officiallanguage. If there are two official languages 6 percent of thesurface must be covered and where there are three officiallanguages, 8 percent must be covered.   Tar and nicotine levels must also be clearly indicated oncigarette packs and must take up the same surface as the healthwarning.   Britain, although bound by the majority decision, was the onlyEEC member state to vote against the new law, saying that it wentbeyond the EEC's powers to adopt legislation to complete theinternal market by the end of 1992.   By this date, all barriers to the free movement of goods,capital, people and services between the 12-nation trade blocshould be dismantled.   But the EEC Commission argued that all tobacco products must belabeled in the same way otherwise countries could refuse theirentry on the grounds that they were incorrectly labeled.   The World Health Organization estimates that 440,000 EECcitizens die every year from diseases caused by smoking.</TEXT></DOC>
