Developmentof the method and the steps involved were described. Results collectedduring a year and a half of waste water analyses were discussed and chemometriccharacteristics of the method presented. Service experience showed thetechnique designed for waste waters to be also useful for analyzing anumber of other materials.</TEXT></DOC>
