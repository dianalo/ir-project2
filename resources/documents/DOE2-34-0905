The beam is focused owing to the anode geometryand the induced self-magnetic field. The phenomena of the beam focusingstrongly depend on both the background plasma pressure of the drift regionand the applied magnetic field. In the case that the plasma pressureis 3.0 Torr and the 0.2-Tesla magnetic field is applied in the distanceof 2.0 cm, the self-magnetic field is induced in the vicinity of thefocal spot, and the rotating and propagating beam with the intensityof 108 TW/cm/sup 2/ and the beam radius of 3.5 mm is formed after thefocal spot.</TEXT></DOC>
