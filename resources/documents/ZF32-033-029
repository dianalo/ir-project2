(Interviews).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Q: What role do you see Microsoft Corp. playing in helping Fortune 500business achieve a marriage between business goals and informationtechnology?andM;A: I am absolutely convinced that there is an MIS analog to time to marketand that the MIS organizations that focus on reducing their time to deploysystems, as a primary metric, will do far better than those that focus onsome other issue.andP;  Because it will force them to break projects up intodigestible pieces.andP;  It will force them to create flexible technology.andP;  Itwill require them to look at the enormous amounts of money they spend onsustaining existing stuff versus developing new stuff....andM;But the andlsqb;keyandrsqb; is this notion of information as an asset--as a corporateasset.andP;  Our role is to put in place those tools that allow you to get at thatinformation easily in different ways depending upon what your needs are, intimely ways, and to recognize that the users of the information are probablynot, nor do they want to be, computer scientists.andM;So the role that we see for Microsoft is we look at the PC as a window onthis information stuff.andP;  We call it Information At Your Fingertips.andP;  Peoplewill say, &quot;well, is that a kind of a marketing term?andP;  Why don't you sayclient/server like everybody else?&quot;andM;Q: Thank you for not sayingg it like that.andM;A: The point is that client/server is but one of many technologies that arethere to do this....andP;  But the key is recognition that the information hasvalue and needs to be accessed easily, and it needs to be accessed bydifferent people for different things.andP;  And the role of Microsoft is to puttogether a set of tools--operating systems, networking systems,applications--that facilitate and allow that to happen....andM;That's part of the reason why we want to talk about Information At YourFingertips and not be constrained to just client/server.andP;  Client/server is atechnology that supports that.andP;  But so are advanced file systems.andP;  So areobject-oriented development tools.andP;  So are end-user development tools,effective macro languages that are common across a bunch of applications.andP;  Soare database access tools inside of a spreadhseet....andM;The other role that we play is not only to provide those solutions today butto try to have a vision of what is possible in 1995 and the year 2000.andM;So we operate on the assumption that there is going to be virtually unlimitedon-line storage, somewhere, somehow.andP;  You will have the capability to store,in rapidly accessible places, virtually everything, and you can begin to usethe power of the technology, the MIPS, if you will, on the desktop.andM;Q: Are we going to see an architectual announcement from you--a Microsoftarchitecture--like we've seen from IBM with Systems Application Architecture,and from Unisys Corp. and from Computer Associates International Inc.?andM;A: No as, far as I am concerned, you are seeing it today.andP;  You've got Windowson the desktop.andP;  If you want an architecture, it is built around those thingsand the extension of those things.andP;  Not, if you will, a top-downpronouncement on how you link a bunch of disparate things together.andM;Q: Nevertheless, you paint a picture of a company a lot broader than simplythat of a software company, more of a broad-based integrator.andP;  Do you thinkthe MIS world perceives Microsoft in that role, and do you have all theplanks in place to achieve that yet?andM;A: The answer to the question, Do people believe we have that role? is notyet, but increasingly so.andP;  I think that many companies who have acquiredtechnology are now looking at a smaller number of strategic technologyproviders.andP;  And many of them have come to the realization that there is notso much in dollar value, but certainly much impact of Microsoft technology,scattered through a lot of critical parts of the business--on most of thePCs, if not all of them; in operating systems; sometimes in networks; andsometimes in applications, development tools, etc.andP;  So by, if you will,presence, it andlsqb;Microsoftandrsqb; is becoming significant, irrespective of what sideof the downsizing question you are on.andP;  The question is, Are we geared up todeal with, you know, the implications of this?andM;Q: And what do you think those implications are?andP;  Are you talking about datamanagement, connection of different-sized machines within one organization?andO;Different operating systems?andP;  Different databases?...andM;A: Well, the implications, I believe, are number one, you've got to have avision of where the technology will grow and drive your product development.andO;Because the second piece is, we are not going to do it all ourselves.andP;  It'sincredibly naive to say we will build the desktop operating systems, thedesktop applications, the networking, and oh my gosh we had better getcontrol of the database on the mainframe.andP;  That won't happen.andP;  So the key forus is to stick to the things that we do well, that are critical to thevision, and support others who are going to do the other pieces.andM;Q: Is networking critical to the vision?andP;  There have been some questionsraised about the commitment to LAN Manager.andP;  Is it still strategic to thecompany?andM;A: Oh sure.andP;  It is strategic to the company.andP;  But it is not.andP;  It alsorecognizes that the world is going to stay with the number of networkingvendors, and we are going to have to connect with a lot of things.andP;  And myobjective very simply is that our desktop operating systems, let me talkspecifically about Windows, ought to be the best client anywhere, ought to bethe universal client.andP;  You ought to be able to get at the UNIX server, themainframe, to another PC on that LAN.andP;  It ought to work very well withMicrosoft LAN technology, but it also needs to connect with VAX and UNIX andBanyan and Novell.andP;  So it andlsqb;LAN Managerandrsqb; is very important as a business.andM;Q: Do you see Microsoft moving into the information management business?andM;A: NO, I still describe us in the software business.andP;  Information managementhas different rings.andP;  It talks to us about managing infromation, as opposedto software.andP;  It is agreed that software, some software, is in the systemsmanagement business.andP;  I guess we are there.andP;  I mean you can't run anetworking system without having systems management software.andP;  Do we seeourselves getting above the LANs, if you will, to begin to run a NetView orsome other very broad-based system management mainframe-or mini-residentstuff?andP;  Probably not....andM;Q: What is the role of the Consulting Services organization Microsoft formedlast year in all of this?andM;A: It is not to create a facilities management organization.andP;  It is to helpdesign systems.andP;  It is to help do design reviews.andP;  It is to do customizationwhere you need to develop unique capabilities, device drivers or interfaces.andO;In many cases, it is helping with, interestingly enough, with the wholeplanning process on how do I build a strategic plan for this technology thatdoes support my business plan, as flexible enough, adaptable enough, that Idon't end up redoing it three or four years from now....andM;Q: Do you see yourself competing more in the future with companies likeAndersen Consulting, Electronic Data Systems Corp. or Unisys?andM;A: Generally, I would see us working in a complementary way with those.andP;  Wehave a strategic relationship with Andersen Consulting now, where they findleads to where they really need the expertise in client/service graphicalinterfaces, Windows, whatever it turns out to be....andP;  They don't want to doit all, either.andP;  So, it is an environment where they standardize on oursoftware.andP;  We help support that activity.andP;  We jointly look at some things.andO;We pass leads back and forth, and so I don't view Andersen Consulting or anEDS as a competitor at all.andP;  We have a very focused view.andM;Q: How are you managing to maintain the focus:?andM;A: There is no textbook for what we are doing.andP;  How do you keep anorganization that has been successful by having small groups very focused,that communicate very, very well?andP;  How do you take that model and make itwork as you move from 5,300 people, which is where it was when I started, toover 8,000, which is where it is today, on a worldwide basis?andP;  Where you aredoing business in 27 countries.andP;  Where you localize product into 24languages.andP;  Where you are moving off of a simple model where you hadoperating systems sold to OEMS and you had applications sold to resellers towhere you now have applications that are being used as development tools.andO;Where you have systems products like Windows that are now being solddirectly.andP;  Where you have front ends to corporate databases.andM;Q: How do you put in place the marketing and support model to make that work?andM;A: ...andP;  The key for us is to keep very focused, not to be lured into avertical application because, you know, manufacturing looks big, or healthcare, or whatever.andP;  We build desk and server operating systems.andP;  We buildapplications, you know, spreadsheets, mail...andM;Q: So we wouldn't necessarily see Microsoft in the market for acquiring,let's say, a vertical-industry-specific company?andM;A: Not in the game plan.andP;  andlsqb;Butandrsqb; you will see some low-end products....andP;  We'llbe in the lanugages and tool business because we think that is very importantto create the applications that those vertical ISVs or corporate developersmay develop.andP;  And so, in that way, we really continue to stay focused.andM;Q: How do you think you are doing in maintaining that focus--particularly inlight of the widely reported memo that chairman Bill Gates wrote?andM;A: Well, you know, we have to continue to go back and test everything we aredoing to make sure that we are focused in doing what we want to do very well.andO;And to also make sure that we never get complacent in our business....andM;We need to do better in a number of areas.andP;  Customer support is one.andO;Supporting our ISVs is another.andP;  You know it is not good enough just to say&quot;here is Windows, and it is a great development platform.&quot;andP;  You've got tohelp them exploit that platform because it is in both our best interests tohave a lot of Windows applications out there.andP;  Even if you are helping acompetitor.andM;Q: Could you describe the thinking that went into devising this idea ofInformation At Your Fingertips?andM;A: It's been evolving, I would say, for a long time.andP;  And it has its roots inthe mid-'80s with the notion of a graphical user interface.andP;  The decade ofthe '80s to a large degree was the decade of the evolution of a graphicinterface.andP;  How do you make it easy for the user to manipulate data to planthings, to have a very intuitive environment, to be able to look at twoapplications and cut and paste and all the rest of that stuff?andP;  So the firstmanifestation is a recognition that the end user is a mere mortal, not acomputer scientist, necessarily.andM;Q: So then that concept kind of broadened out?andM;A: It broadened out, and I would say the stop along the way was this notionof client/server.andP;  andlsqb;Butandrsqb; even the notion of client/server was too confining.andO;It wasn't broad enough to direct all the interesting things that were goingon when you look at portable equipment.andP;  Fifteen years ago, we talked about acomputer on every desk and in every home.andP;  The thing that they andlsqb;Microsoftandrsqb;missed was the portable....andM;But even in this environment, the notion of what's data center comes to you.andO;It starts to change, because data centers still tend to be somewhat, youknow, confining.andP;  We would envision data kind of migrating on its own, basedon how it's used.andP;  highly volatile data that needs to be updated frequentlyprobably ought to stick in the traditional data center.andP;  As data becomes morestable, less volatile perhpas, it ought to migrate somewhre else in thenetwork, where it is more accessible, even onto you hard disk on yourmachine.andP;  There is a whole set of reasons as to where the data ought toreside that ought to be variable, fluid and not constrained by thetechnology.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
