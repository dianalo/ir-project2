People close to Philip Morris said the New York-based food company has lined up bank commitments of at least $12 billion to finance the $11.4 billion takeover bid, with Citibank serving as the lead bank. Philip Morris also has $1.5 billion in available cash and the ability to acquire more funding if necessary, although people close to the company said some of the funds available are targeted for other corporate purposes and for expenses related to the proposed acquisition.    Philip Morris's merger advisers, Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., stand to make $12 million if the transaction goes through. In addition, Wasserstein Perella also has a long-term contract to advise Philip Morris on other mergers and acquisitions. The firm was established eight months ago by former First Boston merger specialists Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella.    Separately, a Kraft shareholder filed suit against the company in Delaware, contending that the Glenview, Ill., food company and its directors were violating their fiduciary duties in seeking to thwart Philip Morris's bid. The suit, filed by Rodney B. Shields, seeks class-action status. Kraft said it would have no comment on the lawsuit. </TEXT></DOC>
