The December jump in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,which is designed to predict economic activity six to nine months inthe future, followed a 0.2 percent decrease in November and a 0.5percent rise in October.   The index has alternated between dips and gains for the past ninemonths, which many economists believe is a signal the economy isheaded for a slowdown in growth that would help keep inflation incheck.   ``It tells you that there is not a boom building,'' said SamuelD. Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government SecuritiesInc. in Chicago. ``It suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in thenext couple of quarters, but it most assuredly does not point to anykind of a recession.''   The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowestquarterly performance in two years was recorded during theOctober-December period, when the increase in the gross nationalproduct was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.   Although President Bush plans to adopt his predecessor's forecastthat the economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, manyprivate economists believe the Reagan administration's predictionsfor growth, interest rates and inflation were too optimistic.   Six of the nine available components of the economic indexcontributed to December's increase, while two detracted from it.   The biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers' ordersfor consumer goods. Other business barometers that contributed tothe increase were: rising stock prices, more orders for new plantsand equipment, rising prices for raw materials signaling a strongdemand, increased demand for business permits and growth in theinflation-adjusted money supply.   The indictors that made a negative contribution were a shorteningin the length of the average work week and an increase in weeklyunemployment claims.   One indicator, the time needed for companies to receivedeliveries from vendors, was unchanged.   December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967base of 100. That was up 2 percent from the same month a yearearlier.   In another economic report released today, the CommerceDepartment said construction spending shot up 2.5 percent inDecember, ending a year in which building activity registered itsweakest showing since the recession year of 1982.   Kahan said construction activity rebounded somewhat toward theend of the year after interest rate increases early in 1988.   An easing of economic strength without the threat of recessionwould be a welcome development for many economists who believeslower growth is needed to keep the economy from overheating andcausing a flare-up in inflation.   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,Mass., said in advance of today's report that the jagged performanceof the leading index indicates ``growth is certainly going to slow,but it doesn't seem to be predicting any recession at this point.''   ``The fact that it's see-sawing says that the real risk of theeconomy overheating ... isn't really there anymore,'' she said. ``Onthe other hand, there's no downturn that extends across theeconomy.''   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said beforethe report was released that if inflation stays under control, ``Idon't see anything else on the horizon that would terminate therecovery.''   ``There is some evidence of slowdown in the economy but not verymuch,'' Evans said. ``It's the so-called soft landing approach,which appears to be working effectively.''   The Federal Reserve Board since March has been pushing upinterest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economicgrowth.   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a congressional committeeTuesday that he believed the central bank's efforts to boostinterest rates would help prolong the recovery.   ``As we enter 1989, there are few signs of any significantimpediments to continued expansion,'' he said.   The traditional precursor to an economic downturn has been threeconsecutive declines in the leading index. But while the index hascorrectly predicted all eight recessions since its creation in 1948,it also falsely forecast four additional recessions.   The Commerce Department said that, starting with the report forJanuary, it would drop two indicators from the composite index andadd two others in an attempt to make it more accurately reflectfuture economic trends.</TEXT></DOC>
