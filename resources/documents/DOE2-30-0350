The core was fromcore holes RRL-2, RRL-6, RRL-14, and DC-16 on the Hanford Site in WashingtonState. Joint width was characterized by determining the frequency distributionin each of 16 flow/core hole combination samples (4 flows by 4 core holes= 16 samples) and comparing the distributions between intraflow structures,between basalt flows, and between core holes. Joint infilling was characterizedby determining the percentage of joints with each secondary mineral typepresent and then comparing flows and comparing intraflow instructures.Basalt flows, intraflow structures, and core holes cannot be differentiatedconsistently on the basis of joint width. There is only one populationof widths that can be characterized by a log-normal distribution, anarithmetic mean of 0. 23 mm(9.0E-04in.), and a standard deviation of0.49 mm (1.9E-03in.). Clay is the predominant infilling type followedby silica and zeolite. For example, 98.1% of the randomly selected jointsfrom the Cohassett flow are filled predominately with clay, 6.5% havezeolite predominating, and 4.0% have silica predominating. Only 19(0.6%)of the 3194 joints measured have observable void space. Basalt flowsand intraflow structures cannot be differentiated on the basis jointinfilling types, except for the Umtanum entablature. Joint width andinfilling types are correlated, and secondary minerals fill basalt coolingjoints in a particular sequence.</TEXT></DOC>
