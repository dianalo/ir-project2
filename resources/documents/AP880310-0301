Ltd. proposedthe ultimate in mixed drinks Thursday, announcing it will buyorange juice producer Tropicana Products Inc. for $1.2 billion toexpand Seagram's share of the beverage market.   The Canadian liquor-and-beverage giant's acquisition ofTropicana from Beatrice U.S. Food Corp. marks a ``diversificationand an expansion'' of Seagram's product line, Seagram ChairmanEdgar M. Bronfman said in a statement.   Securities analysts said the move into the orange juice businesswas a logical step for Seagram, which has limited growth potentialthrough its liquor products.   The purchase _ made throught the company's U.S. subsidiary,Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Sons Inc. _ will be financed initially with acombination of bank loans and short-term borrowings, Seagram said.   Montreal-based Seagram, best known for its distilled spirits andwines, has in recent years moved into the manufacturing of winecoolers and sells cocktail mixers such as tonic, seltzer and gingerale under the Seagram's name.   Seagram is also in the process of acquiring French cognacproducer Martell andamp; Co. in a deal valued at $930 million.   ``We have already broadened our base with Seagram's (wine)coolers and Tropicana is another step in this direction,'' Bronfmansaid.   Tropicana, with headquarters in Bradenton, Fla., is a well-knownfruit juice and beverage manufacturer and distributor. It had salesof about $750 million in its last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 29,said Marcelline Thomson, a Seagram spokeswoman in New York.   Tropicana is a leading producer of both ready-to-serve orangejuice and frozen concentrate.   ``It's a good fit,'' said Robert S. Reitzes, who tracks Seagramfor the investment firm Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co. in New York. ``It makessense in their business.''   Ian Osler, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. inToronto, agreed, saying orange juice is not that different fromSeagram's current businesses.   ``They understand the business and it's growing, unlike most oftheir liquor products,'' Osler said.   Reitzes said it was possible Seagram would use the Tropicananame to introduce new products.   Seagram had net income of nearly $423.5 billion on sales of $3.3billion in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 1987, and reported aprofit of more than $402.4 million on sales of $2.6 billion for thenine months ending Oct. 31, Ms. Thomson said.   Beatrice U.S. Food Corp., based in Chicago, is a division ofclosely-held Beatrice Co., which put itself up for sale lastSeptember.   Beatrice Chairman Donald Kelly had hoped to sell the company asa whole, but could not find a buyer at his asking price, reportedly$4.5 billion.   Beatrice spokesman Charles Long said the company also isconsidering selling its Hunt's tomato products and Wesson oilslines.   Beatrice also owns the meat company Swift-Ekrich Inc., Peter Panpeanut butter and Orville Redenbacher popcorn.   The company's predecessor, Beatrice Cos., was taken private in1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co.   A number of Beatrice Cos.' assets, including Avis car rental andInternational Playtex Inc. personal products, were sold off, andothers were spun off as E-II Holdings Inc.   E-II agreed last month to be taken over by American Brands Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
