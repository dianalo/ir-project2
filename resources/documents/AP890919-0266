(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal agency Tuesday again citedLockheed Corp., this time for 230 alleged health and safetyviolations at its aerospace manufacturing plants in Palmdale, SantaClarita and Burbank.   The violations, 114 of them categorized as posing ``substantialprobability that death or serious physical harm could result,''include electrical hazards such as improper use of extension cordsand inadequate grounding.   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied$44,200 in fines for violations uncovered by inspectors duringreviews of the three plants, said Frank Strasheim, OSHA's regionaldirector in San Francisco.   Strasheim said most of the violations have been corrected.   ``During the lengthy inspections, Lockheed had significantlyincreased their safety and health staff and had placed renewedcommitment to putting in place a system which will identify safetyand health hazards and move to eliminate them,'' Strasheim said.   OSHA had fined Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. nearly $1.5million in March for 440 violations of record keeping requirementsand safety standards at its Burbank plant.   Those violations sparked comprehensive inspections at Palmdale,the Rye Canyon plant in Santa Clarita and at the sprawling Burbankfacility.   Lockheed ``knew or should have known of the hazard'' presented bythe violations, which include inadequate guarding of machines and alack of personal protective equipment such as safety gloves andrespirators, OSHA reports said.   ``Our policy has been and will continue to be to work with OSHAto ensure compliance with their regulations,'' Dale Daniels, aLockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. executive vice president, said ina statement.</TEXT></DOC>
