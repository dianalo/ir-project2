If the exemption is granted the restrictions ofsections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resultingfrom the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposedloan of $500,000 by the Plan to the International Chemical Workers Union(ICWU), the Plan sponsor, and to the ICWU Building Corporation (ICWUBC),a non-profit corporation wholly owned by ICWU, under the terms and conditionsdescribed in this notice of proposed exemption, provided that such termsand conditions are not less favorable to the Plan than those obtainableby the Plan in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Facts and Representations </ITAG>1. The ICWU, the Plan sponsor, is an international trade union with headquartersin Akron, Ohio. ICWUBC is a non-profit corporation organized and whollyowned by the ICWU for the purpose of owning and maintaining the headquartersbuilding and an adjacent shopping center (collectively, the HeadquartersBuilding) for the ICWU. The Plan covered 141 employees of the ICWU as ofAugust 12, 1988. As of June 30, 1988, the Plan had $7,910,684 in assets.2. The Plan proposes to lend $500,000 to the ICWU and the ICWUBC, to besecured by a first mortgage (the Loan) on the Headquarters Building. TheLoan will be amortized over a period of 180 months in equal installmentsof interest and principal and will bear interest at a floating rate of\1/2\% over the First National Bank of Ohio prime rate adjusted monthly.The note for the Loan will be signed by both the ICWU and the ICWUBC andwill be duly recorded in accordance with Ohio law. An existing first mortgageon the Headquarters Building held by the First National Bank of Ohio witha balance due of $983,729 as of February 15, 1988, will be paid off atthe time of the proposed transaction. 3. On May 3, 1989, T. Randall Fairfax, Private Banking Officer with NationalCity Bank, Akron (NCB), of Akron, Ohio, stated that NCB was willing tomake the Loan on the same terms and conditions to the ICWU. The applicantrepresents that NCB is unrelated to and has no current or anticipated businesswith ICWU or ICWUBC. 4. On June 20, 1988, John E. Eisenman, President of Industrial Appraisals,Inc., real estate appraisers of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, stated that thefair market value of the Headquarters Building as of that date was $3,750,000.5. On February 7, 1989, Gerrit C. Kuechle (Mr. Kuechle), President of NationalAssociates, Inc. (NA), actuaries and pension consultants doing businessin Cleveland, Ohio, agreed to serve as independent fiduciary with respectto the proposed transaction. NA serves as independent Plan actuary, buthas no other relationship with the Plan or any of its principals. Mr. Kuechlerepresents that he is qualified to serve as independent fiduciary as heis accustomed to dealing with transactions similar to the proposed transaction,and is familiar with the requirements of ERISA. Mr. Kuechle states thatthe terms and conditions of the Loan are comparable to similar loans betweenunrelated parties, and that the proposed transaction is in the best interestand protective of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, andis in keeping with the Plan's investment objectives and liquidity and diversificationrequirements. Finally, Mr. Kuechle states that as independent fiduciaryhe will have the authority necessary to enforce the terms of the proposedtransaction and to take any steps necessary to protect the benefits ofthe Plan's participants and beneficiaries. 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction meetsthe statutory criteria under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) TheLoan will be approved, monitored and enforced by an independent fiduciary;(b) the Loan will be secured by a first mortgage on the Headquarters Building,the fair market value of which represents more than 150% of the Loan; (c)the Loan will be for an amount well below 25% of the Plan's assets; (d)the Plan's independent fiduciary has determined that the Loan is prudentand in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the Plan;and (e) NCB, an unrelated bank, has stated that it would make the Loanon the same terms and conditions. <T3>For Further Information Contact: </T3>Joseph L.

The Plan is a defined benefit plan which had approximately 9,738 participantsas of December 31, 1987. The Plan had approximately $48.5 million in assetsas of that date. 2. During 1987, several discussions were held between representatives ofvarious employers in the building service industry (the Association) andthe organization which acts as collective bargaining agent for the employeesin that industry_Service Employees International Union Local 32E, AFL-CIO(the Union). These discussions concerned the need for better training foremployees of this industry in the New York Metropolitan Area. The Associationand the Union jointly agreed to develop and administer a building maintenancetraining program. 3. The next step was to acquire appropriate facilities to carry out thetraining program. The Building, a vacant school building in the South Bronxarea of New York became available in 1987 and was put on public auctionby New York City (the City). One of the conditions established by the Citywas that the Building could only be owned and operated by an entity whichis exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c) of the Code. The Associationand the Union agreed to form a not-for-profit corporation, BMI, which wouldoperate the training program. BMI was formed on April 12, 1988. 4. Neither the Association nor the Union had sufficient funds to buy theBuilding, and BMI was not formed as of December 10, 1987, the date of theauction held by the City. The Plan's trustees decided to use Plan assetsto purchase the Building with the intention of securing a profit for thePlan. Mr. John S. Johnsen (Mr. Johnsen), a real estate broker and seniorreal estate appraiser for the firm of Helmsley-Spear, Inc. in the City,had appraised the Building as having a fair market value of $400,000 asof December 8, 1987. The Plan acquired the Building at the December 10,1987 auction for a price of $227,000. The purchase thus gave the Plan aunique opportunity to make a short-term investment for a sizable financialgain, especially since there was a prospective buyer for the Building atthe time of the Plan's purchase.\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Department is expressing no opinion as to whetherthe acquisition of the Building by the Plan violated any provision of Part4 of Title I of the Act.  5. On June 8, 1988, the Plan also purchased the Parking Lot for $40,000.The Parking Lot consists of vacant land adjacent to the Building. The Planhas since spent approximately $11,000 in capital improvements to the ParkingLot. In all, the Plan has spent $56,685.87 on the Parking Lot, which includespurchase price, improvements, legal fees, and real estate taxes.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Department is expressing no opinion as to whetherthe acquisition of the Parking Lot by the Plan violated any provision ofPart 4 of Title I of the Act. 6. The Plan now wishes to sell the Building and the Parking Lot to BMI.Mr. Johnsen has updated his December 8, 1987 appraisal of the Building,and he estimates its fair market value at $500,000 as of March 16, 1989.Since the Plan's total costs for the Building have been approximately $320,000,the applicants represent that the sales price to BMI will be the appraisedvalue of $500,000. Mr. Johnsen has appraised the fair market value of theParking Lot as being $30,000 as of January 31, 1989. Thus, the sales priceof the Parking Lot to BMI will be $56,685.87, which represents the totalcosts of the Parking Lot to the Plan. The sales will be for cash and nocommissions will be paid with respect to the sales. 7. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactionswill satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) Thesales will be a one-time transaction for cash; (2) no commissions willbe paid with respect to the sales; and (3) the Plan will sell the Buildingand the Parking Lot at the greater of their appraised value as determinedby Mr. Johnsen, a qualified independent appraiser, or their actual costbasis. <T3>For Further Information Contact:</T3> Gary H.

Eubanks (the Eubanks) in the Plan of certain land (the Property) tothe Eubanks', parties in interest with respect to the Plan, provided thatthe Plan receives the greater of $37,100 or the fair market value at thetime of the sale. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Facts and Representations </ITAG>1. The Plan, established in 1985, is a profit sharing plan which consistsof 10 participants. As of January 31, 1988 total plan assets were $120,278.The Plan provides for participant direction for the investment of separateaccount assets. As of December 31, 1988, total assets of Theresa M. Eubanks'separate account was $36,552 (Account 1). As of the same date, total assetsof Robert L. Eubanks' separate account was $21,228 (Account 2). The applicantrepresents that the current trustees of the Plan are Robert L. Eubanksand Theresa M. Eubanks. The Employer, Eubanks and Eubanks, D.O., P.C.,is a medical corporation delivering osteopathic family medical care. 2. The Accounts 1 and 2 purchased the Property on March 6, 1986, for $31,000cash from an unrelated party. The Property is currently held jointly inthese Accounts. The property which consists of unimproved vacant land locatedin Gresham, Oregon was purchased in order to increase the return of theAccounts. The applicant maintains that there is no outstanding debt onthe Property. The Property has not been used by any party in interest sinceits acquistion by the Accounts. 3. The applicant proposes to sell the Property to the Eubanks'. An appraisalof the Property was prepared by Phyllis F. Horsfeldt, I.F.A. (Ms. Horsfeldt),a real estate broker and appraiser. The appraisal, dated September 14,1988, estimates the value of the Property to be $37,100. Ms. Horsfeldtrepresents that she is independent of the parties involved and qualifiedto perform the appraisal. In a letter of March 8, 1989, Ms. Horsfeldt concludesthat the Eubanks' ownership of property adjacent to the Property does notmerit a premium above the fair market value in the proposed purchase. 4. The applicant represents that the transaction is desirable for the Accounts.The sale will increase the liquidity available to the Eubanks' upon retirement.The transaction is protective of the Accounts because the value of theProperty was determined by a qualified independent appraiser. Furthermore,because the Property is held only by the Accounts the sale will not affectother participants of the Plan. The applicant maintains that economic hardshipwill result if the transaction is denied with the Accounts foregoing anopportunity to participate in investment vehicles with a higher return.The Accounts would also continue to incur real estate taxes in holdingthe Property. The applicant maintains that attempts to sell the Propertyto independent third parties yielded no comparable offers. Furthermore,in a sale to an unrelated third party, the Accounts will be liable forbrokerage commissions and other transaction expenses. 5. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfiesthe statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)of the Code because: (a) The proposed sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (b) The price paid to the Accounts will be the greater of $37,100 or thefair market value at the time of the sale as determined by an independent,qualified appraiser; (c) The Plan or the Accounts will pay no expenses associated with the sale;(d) The sale will allow the Accounts to liquidate its assets and to providecash for investments with a higher yield. <T3>For Further Information Contact: </T3>Ekaterina A.
