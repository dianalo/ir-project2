U.S. District Judge William T. Hart approved a consent agreementrequiring the suburb to issue a previously denied permit forconstruction of the home by Residential Facilities ManagementServices Inc. of Galesburg.   The city, while not admitting to any discrimination, also agreedto pay $45,000 in damages _ $30,000 to RFMS for construction delaysand $1,000 to each of the 15 people who will eventually live in thehome.   The agreement settles lawsuits filed last summer by RFMS and theU.S. Justice Department under a Fair Housing Act amendment, passedin March, barring discrimination against the handicapped.   At issue was a May 1 vote by Chicago Heights City Councildenying the permit for the home. The lawsuits contended the CityCouncil was motivated by opposition from residents fearful of andprejudiced against the retarded.   The Justice Department lawsuit was the first case brought by thegovernment under the Fair Housing amendment.   ``Our hope is that this (agreement) will be noted by othercommunities, not only in the Chicago metropolitan area of Illinois,but nationwide _ that it's impermissible for them to deny access toliving accomodations on behalf of developmentally disabledpersons,'' said Richard E. Friedman, attorney for RFMS. The companyoperates 55 group homes in 35 other Illinois communities.   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said thesettlement may make it easier for the government to obtain courtorders in future cases involving the refusal of local governmentsto grant permits for group homes.   Department lawyers were considering legal action elsewhere aswell but chose to await the results of the Chicago Heights case,she said. The settlement should also encourage cities to complywith federal law, she said.   Chicago Heights maintained the permit was denied because RFMShad not supplied necessary documents with its application.   ``The fact that the inhabitants happened to be developmentallydisabled was not a factor,'' said the suburb's attorney, Nick J. DiGiovanni.   Under the agreement, the company pledged that the home will notbe used to care for mentally ill or emotionally disturbed patients.   ``We hope other communities will get the message that thehandicapped have rights under the Fair Housing Act,'' said James P.Turner, acting head of the Justice Department's civil rightsdivision. ``If local officials don't pay attention to those rights,they will pay damages for violating them.''   Turner credited Chicago Heights officials with ``seeing that itwas not in the city's best interests to continue fighting thislawsuit.''</TEXT></DOC>
