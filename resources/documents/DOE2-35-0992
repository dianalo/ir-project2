Three modelization methods are developed and their resultsare compared: an equivalent storage temperature method, a simplifiedregression method and general regression method. The global behaviourof the exchanger is poorly described by the first method; the secondmethod is well adapted to fixed bed exchangers while the third methodis more adapted to phase change material exchanger - storage systems.</TEXT></DOC>
