Figuring crude oil would go higher, many of them locked in prices in the$30-a-barrel range only to see prices plunge more than $10 a barrel.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FUTURES TRADING: HOW MUCH RISK CAN YOU STAND?  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     That's why one of the first things a broker will ask investors interestedin playing the futures markets is how much they can afford to lose.;   &quot;That's part of our jobs as brokers -- to see if you can afford to assume therisk,&quot; said Freeman Barber, vice president and manager of the futures divisionat Interstate/Johnson Lane Securities Inc. &quot;Part of a good broker's job is tocontrol that risk.&quot;;    Barber said most investors study the markets, workwith their brokers and take calculated risks. Experienced speculatorsgenerally don't follow more than two or three of the 30-plus futures contractofferings at a time.;    Generally, your income should be high enough to allowyou the financial freedom to invest in the futures markets, most brokersadvise. The potential for astronomical gains sometimes attracts investors withget-rich-quick aspirations.;    But Barber said that during the 14 years hewas a broker, &quot;I can remember only two customers I'd call outright gamblers. .. . They had no plan. . . . They were buying everything trying to make a fasthit.&quot;;    He said Interstate/Johnson Lane has 10 brokers in the Southeast whotrade regularly in futures contracts ranging from grains to gold. They placeorders through the trading desk in Charlotte, which has about 30 phone linesto trading floors in the various markets.;    Barber said interest in futurestrading is growing. Even institutional investors are beginning to add futurescontracts to investment portfolios. &quot;We opened more accounts in the lastquarter than in the previous 69 months,&quot; he said.;    For people who want ataste of futures trading with lower risks, he suggests commodities funds, ofwhich there are about 15.;    Typically such funds -- similar to mutual funds-- will trade a diversified portfolio of futures that may include stockindexes, interest rates, foreign currencies, metals and energy, in addition totraditional agriculture and livestock commodities.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DOUG SMITH, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Charlotte, N.C.  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  371  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 22, 199100053017,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
