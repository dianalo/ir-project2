Monday announced three enhanced HP DraftMaster penplotters that have increased functionality and are lower in price than theplotters they replace.andM;The new plotters have all the high-performance qualities of the current HPDraftMaster series plotters, plus improved front panels and the new HPSurePlot drawing system, which helps eliminate plotter-pen problems andreduces the need for user intervention.andM;The new plotters are: - The HP DraftMaster SX Plus plotter is a sheet-feedplotter with a 1-Mbyte buffer for $7,495 (U.S.andP;  List) -- $1,000 less than theHP Draftmaster SX plotter it replaces;andM;- The HP DraftMaster RX Plus plotter has the same features as the HPDraftMaster SX Plus plotter as well as roll-feed capabilities, an automaticmedia cutter and a media tray.andP;  It is $9,495 (U.S.andP;  List) -- $500 less thanthe HP Draftmaster RX plotter it replaces; andandM;- The HP DraftMaster MX Plus plotter offers the same capabilities as the HPDraftMaster RX Plus plotter plus four RS-232-C ports and a 20-Mbyte plotspooler.andP;  It is $10,995 (U.S.andP;  List) -- $1,000 less than the HP DraftmasterMX plotter it replaces.andM;HP SUREPLOT DRAWING SYSTEM The HP SurePlot drawing system includes apen-distance monitor, pen-grouping feature and an optical line sensor.andP;  Thesenew features prevent, detect and correct common plotter-pen problems, such asempty, clogged or dry pens, for a higher percentage of quality plots thanpreviously possible.andM;The pen-distance monitor prevents pens from running out of ink by monitoringthe distance a pen has traveled.andP;  The plotter automatically replaces the oldpen with a new pen that the user preselects by using the pen-groupingfeature.andM;At intervals selected by the user, the optical line sensor periodicallyverifies that the ink being placed on the media meets a print-contrastspecification.andP;  The sensing interval can be selected to verify the line atdistances from 0.5m to 8m.andP;  Greater frequency of line verification increasesthe likelihood of a good plot; because it increases plotting time, it is mostsuitable for final plots.andM;The plotter can be preset to correct missing-line problems according to theuser's needs by: -- retracing the plot with a fresh pen from the last goodverification point;andM;-- restarting the plot with a fresh pen; orandM;-- stopping and alerting the user (by a beeper) that a pen failure has beendetected.andM;The new HP DraftMaster series plotters work with a wide variety of pens.andP;  Forbest results with the HP SurePlot drawing system, however, HP recommends theHP SurePlot disposable drafting pens, which have ceramic tips for clog-freeplotting and are designed to be leakproof for the life of the pen.andM;HP PLOTTER PERFORMANCE Plotter speed is primarily determined by theacceleration of the plotter and its top velocity.andP;  The new plotters have thesame maximum acceleration of 5.7g and top velocity of 110cm/s as the currentHP DraftMaster series plotters.andM;Three drawing-quality settings are available on the new plotters to matchplotting speed and output quality to the plotting task:andM;-- draft mode offers the fastest speeds available, without using the opticalline sensor or pen-distance monitor;andM;-- quality mode plots at lower, preselected speeds for higher-quality plots,without the use of the pen monitor or optical line sensor; andandM;-- the quality-with-line-verificationmode results in the highest-qualitydrawing by using default settings for the plotter speed, optical line-sensorchecking rate, error-recovery method and pen-distance monitor.andM;OTHER NEW FEATURES The roll-feed HP DraftMaster RX Plus and HP DraftMaster MXPlus plotters feature one-axis media cutters, which automatically cut rollmedia through software commands or manually via the front panel.andP;  A new mediatray catches the cut plot.andP;  The optional take-up reel (Part 17625A) isrecommended for fragile media, such as vellum, or for long-axis plotting.andM;A new, vacuum-fluorescent, front-panel display designed to be easy to read ina variety of lighting situations is standard on the new HP DraftMaster seriesplotters.andP;  Action keys, such as drawing- quality and media-cutting, have beenadded to the front panel.andP;  Menu keys provide fast access to plot management,plot format, pen settings and plotter setup menus.andM;HP-GL/2 GRAPHICS LANGUAGE The new HP DraftMaster series plotters use theHP-GL/2 graphics language, which is supported by a wide variety of softwarepackages.andP;  HP-GL/2 reduces file-transmission time, freeing the user's PCquickly.andP;  The new plotters also support the HP-GL graphics language forsoftware written prior to HP-GL/2.andM;WARRANTY andamp; AVAILABILITY The new HP DraftMaster SX Plus, HP DraftMaster RXPlus and HP DraftMaster MX Plus plotters come standard with limited, 3-yearon-site warranties.andP;  The plotters are available immediately fromHP-authorized dealers and HP's direct sales force.andM;HP DRAFTMASTER SERIES PLOTTERS andamp; ACCESSORIESandM;U.S.andP;  LISTandM;HP PART #         DESCRIPTION                                 PRICEandM;7595C             HP DraftMaster SX Plus plotter             $7,495andM;(A/E size, single-sheet feed)andM;7596C             HP DraftMaster RX Plus plotter              9,495andM;(A/E size, roll feed)andM;7599B             HP DraftMaster MX Plus plotter             10,995andM;(A/E size with 20-Mbyte spooler)andM;17624A            HP DraftMaster RX Plus upgrade kit          2,295andM;(converts HP DraftMaster SX Plus toandM;HP DraftMaster RX Plus)andM;17627A            HP DraftMaster MX Plus upgrade kit          2,195andM;(converts HP DraftMaster RX Plus toandM;HP DraftMaster MX Plus)andM;17625A           HP DraftMaster Series                          595andM;media take-up reelandM;(for HP DraftMaster RX and MX Plus)andM;17626A           HP DraftMaster SeriesandM;automatic-cutter blade-replacementandM;kit                                          19.95</TEXT></DOC>
