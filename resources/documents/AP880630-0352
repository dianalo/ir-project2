The FBI described how latereach day, Saunders passed on information to Muldoon.   The data Saunders allegedly passed included: word that all buttwo companies would be eliminated by the final bidding, the laterbids by Ford and Norden and that by February, Norden was consideredamong the top four bidders even though E-Systems and Ford werelower in price. The FBI said Muldoon was working for Norden.   At one point, the FBI said, Saunders warned Muldoon to becareful to whom he relayed some information because it was``extraordinarily private.''   When Saunders told Muldoon that Norden had become a leadingbidder, Muldoon replied that the ``$60,000 is in the bag now.''   Neither Saunders nor Muldoon answered phone calls to their homesThursday night.   The FBI said it began tapping Muldoon's telephones in Washingtonin July 1987.   The FBI also said:   _Saunders got advance word in December 1987 from Stone about a$32 million contract for secure Navy radio equipment.   _Stone called Saunders at home in January 1988 to give him thenames of the finalists, which he called the ``inside skinny,'' on a$10 million Navy contract for a Tactical Environmental SupportSystem. Saunders told Muldoon that this data was hard to get andnow ``we can't even make any money on it.''   _In November 1987, Saunders provided Muldoon with a draft of thegovernment's plan for acquiring a $50 million Fiber Optics CableSystem.   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon the company he wasworking for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for amore than $100 million Digital Wide-Band Transmission Systemcontract.   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon about an internal Navysplit over how to handle a $10 million contract for a prototype ofa sonar system.   _In July 1987, Saunders told Muldoon that a $100 millionAnti-Submarine Warfare Operation Center contract might have to berestructured and rebid.   _In November 1987, Stone told Saunders of a decision that dayabout a $100 million Digital Communications Terminal contract.   The ninth contract described by the FBI was a $9,000 governmentsubcontract which had been awarded to Saunders to develop a plan tobuy radios. The FBI said Saunders worked with Bradley so Variancould win the radio contract.   The FBI said that in a series of conversations from September toDecember of 1987, Bradley and Saunders discussed how to write theacquisition plan ``to make it difficult for other companies tocompete with Varian.''   In one conversation, Saunders allegedly confirmed receiving a$1,600 check from Bradley. Bradley allegedly said if things workedout for Varian, he would try to get a bonus for Saunders, the FBIsaid.   Bradley told Saunders that ``Bradley would like to `wash' thepayment and suggested that perhaps he should make the payments toMarilyn Burgess instead of Saunders,'' the FBI said. The FBI saidMs. Burgess lives at Saunders' home and is vice president of hiscompany.   But ``Saunders told Bradley that he had someone else in mind,that being MET Associates, a company owned by Tom Muldoon,'' theFBI said.   The FBI said Saunders also did work for Varian Continental oncontracts with the U.S. Information Agency and the Voice ofAmerica. FBI agents overheard Saunders telling an associate inSeptember 1987 about that work, ``if I thought DOD (Department ofDefense) was corrupt, it is absurd the way these people operate.''There was no explanation of who ``these people'' were.   The FBI said the investigation began September 1986 when the FBIand the Naval Investigative Service were told that a consultant hadapproached an employee of a company which had bid on a Marine Corpscontract, offering to provide competitors' costs and bid data andgovernment bid evaluations.   With the employee's consent, agents recorded his conversationswith the consultant, who subsequently was confronted and agreed tocooperate in recording conversations with other individuals.   This group of recordings revealed, the FBI said, that defenseconsultant William Parkin, a retired Navy missile buyer, ``servedas a middleman who paid government employees for inside informationand sold it to contractors.'' In January 1987, a court orderedtapping of Parkin's office and home telephones.   By April 1987, the FBI said, those wiretaps led agents to tapthe telephones and bug the offices of consultant William Galvin.   By June 1987, taps and bugs were authorized for the officetelephones and office of consultant Melvyn Paisley, who hadresigned three months earlier as assistant Navy secretary forresearch, engineering and systems.   The FBI later tapped or bugged consultant Donald Illeman inSouthern California. Illeman, who has not been previouslyidentified with the case, did not immediately return a telephonemessage.   Later taps or bugs were placed on consultants Fred Lackner,Charles Gardner and Jim Rapinac.   The FBI filed a five-page, handwritten list of items seized inBradley's office, including a Rolodex file, a letter dated May 19,1988 from Saunders to Bradley regarding a contractual agreement, acomputer floppy disc, a ``VOA Debriefing Correspondence file,containing bid correspondence,'' and a ``memo from (the) DeputySecretary of Defense regarding controlling defense outlays.''</TEXT><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ Associated Press Writer Dan Calderon in Dallas</HEAD><TEXT>   contributed to this story.</TEXT></DOC>
