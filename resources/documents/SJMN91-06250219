This is a healthissue. Clearly, we have to protect non-smokers.&quot;;   The law bans smoking inrestaurants but not in bars or bar areas that serve food. Restaurants with upto 50 seats will have 30 days after final approval of the ban to become 60percent non-smoking. All restaurants will be required to be 80 percentnon-smoking by Jan. 1, 1992, and 100 percent smoke-free by Sept. 1, 1992.;  The ordinance passed Tuesday also requires that 50 percent of the outdoorseating in restaurants be non-smoking. Additionally, it restricts cigarettevending machines to places inaccessible to minors and prohibits smoking in allhealth care facilities, enclosed employee eating areas, polling places andcity-owned cars.;   Only Los Gatos is considering stricter measures. InOctober, council members there will consider banning smoking in all bars aswell as in all restaurants.;   Palo Alto restaurant owners fear the ban willsend customers, particularly foreign visitors who smoke, to restaurants innearby Menlo Park, which are required to be 60 percent non-smoking, andMountain View, which must be at least 50 percent non-smoking.;   &quot;Keep in mindthat we are in a recession and that 90 percent of all restaurants fail intheir first year,&quot; said Tom Talbott, owner of Talbott's restaurant onCalifornia Avenue. &quot;We don't need additional hindrances in our business.&quot;;  Owners noted that most restaurants in Palo Alto already have chosen to make 80percent of their seats non-smoking. They argued that restaurants should beable to decide for themselves whether to ban smoking completely.;   Restaurantpatrons, however, applauded the council's decision.;   &quot;I just want to say torestaurateurs who are pitting cash registers against health, I think you willquickly lose the respect of this community,&quot; Irvin Dawid said.;   Restaurantowners won one concession. They persuaded the council to phase in the ban.That way neighboring cities and perhaps even the state have time to passsimilar bans so that Palo Alto restaurants are not at a disadvantage.;  Already, many Palo Alto restaurants that seat 50 or fewer, as well as somelarger restaurants, have chosen to be entirely non-smoking. Restaurants thatseat more than 50 had been required by a city law to maintain at least 60percent of their seating for non-smokers.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910906  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  447  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 6, 199100250219,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
