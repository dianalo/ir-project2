<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0239 </DOCNO><TEXT>The thermal expansion of the High Tsub(c) superconducting ceramic YBa/sub2/Cu/sub 3/Osub(7-{delta}) has been measured from 50 K up to room temperatureby means of a capacitance dilatometer. No detectable anomalous changein length is observed at the critical temperature Tsub(c), within theresolution of our experimental set up: {Delta}1/1 5 10/sup -8/. Thisindicates a weak dependence of Tsub(c) on pressure, contrarily to theone measured on (LaBa)CuO lower Tsub(c) superconducting ceramics. TheDebye temperature is also estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
