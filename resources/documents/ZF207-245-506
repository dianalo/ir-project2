ShererandM;The ANSI committee charged with developing a standard for the C languagerecently rejected a proposal to take on the task of standardizing C++.andM;Despite support of major language vendors, which claimed that standardizationof C++ is necessary for its widespread acceptance, the American NationalStandards Institute's (ANSI) C committee last month refused to back such ameasure.andM;Meanwhile, ATandamp;T is preparing to release version 2.0 of the language on June30.andP;  The new version will add, among other features, multiple inheritance,which allows developers to combine the traits of several types of objectswhen creating new objects.andP;  In the current version, C++ objects can onlyinherit behavior from one type of object.andM;Bjarne Stroustrup, who wrote the original version of C++ at ATandamp;T BellLaboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., is also improving documentation to betterspecify unclear areas of the language.andM;Vendors of C++ compilers and translators say they will update their productsto the new version, and existing C++ users may have to rewrite some of theircode.andM;However, Stroustrup insists that no major revisions will be necessary.andP;  ''Wedon't go around breaking a language,'' he said.andP;  Such C++ vendors as ZortechInc. and Glockenspiel Ltd. have already been involved in the revisionprocess, giving them head starts on their own upgrades.andM;''We've been quite open with what we're working on,'' Stroustrup said.andO;''We're not springing surprises on people.''andM;Vendors and industry experts familiar with the new version confirm that nomajor incompatibilities will arise.andP;  ''It's hard to quantify these things,but I would say it's 98 percent compatible,'' said Richard Wiener,editor-in-chief of the Journal of Object-Oriented Programming and author oftwo books on C++.andP;  ''There will be a few areas where some minor revisionsneed to be made in old code.''andM;Stroustrup said research on the language continues, but that any futureupgrades would be compatible with version 2.0: ''2.0 stabilizes thelanguage,'' he said.andP;  ''What comes after will be pure extensions, notbreaking the code.''andM;Some language vendors, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) and Microsoft Corp.,andO;which are planning to use version 2.0 for their first C++ compilers, wouldlike to see the upgrade process end.andP;  They were among the members of the ANSIC committee that supported a movement to take on the task of standardizingC++.andM;Other members maintained that ANSI's C committee was not the appropriate bodyto determine standards for C++.andP;  A straw ballot of the committee, whichincluded non-voting members, indicated support for the proposal.andP;  However,the official vote failed to produce sufficient support to launch astandardization effort.andM;C++ will not gain widespread acceptance until it is standardized, accordingto HP's Larry Rosler, director of programming language development for theCupertino, Calif., company.andP;  He referred to a letter from a large companylisting what would be necessary before it would standardize on C++.andP;  ''TheirNo.andP;  1 requirement is language-definition stability,'' he said.andM;Rosler equates the status of C++ today to that of C in 1983, just before Cstandardization began.andP;  Different implementations of C were oftenincompatible, a situation HP doesn't want to see repeated with C++.andM;Rosler said that because standardization takes several years, the processshould begin now.andM;Others would prefer to keep the language in ATandamp;T's hands for the time being.andO;''It would be premature and a mistake to solidify the language at thispoint,'' said Wiener.andP;  ''Some juicy changes are yet to come in thelanguage.''andM;Evolution Still NeededandM;If C++ were standardized now, the effect would be ''to freeze the language ata time when it isn't fully mature, and to discourage further development inareas that are needed,'' said Wiener.andP;  He cited parameterized types andexception handling as two key features that should be added.andP;  Stroustrup saidhe is doing research in those areas.andM;Rosler claimed that because it generally takes several years for ANSI toapprove a standard, there would still be time for such maturation of thelanguage.andP;  ''Every standard evolves in the course of time,'' he said, andnoted that other committees have released periodic standards -- for example,ANSI 66 FORTRAN and ANSI 77 FORTRAN.andM;''It's not that we say the ANSI committee should lay down a standard today,''said David Jones, chief designer of the Languages Group at Microsoft, inRedmond, Wash.andP;  ''My guess is it will be some time before a C++ standard willappear.''andM;As it stands, ANSI's C committee will not take up the C++ standardizationprocess.andP;  However, Dmitry Lenkov, a software design engineer at HP, ispreparing a proposal recommending that ANSI establish a new committee forthat purpose.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
