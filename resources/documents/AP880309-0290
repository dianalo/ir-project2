Reporters were not invited to the lobby group's meeting inWashington on Monday, but Dingell's office released a copy of hisremarks on Wednesday.   The offense of insider trading has developed over the yearsthrough court and regulatory interpretations of fraud andsecurities laws.   The securities industry has been pushing Congress to write adefinition into the law, arguing that traders need to knowbeforehand what constitutes insider trading in order to avoidviolating the law.   Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Alfonse D'Amato,R-N.Y., in June introduced a bill with a definition. They have beenworking with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which favorslegislation but has suggested changes in the Senate bill to broadenthe definition.   However, in the House, Dingell told the lobby group flatly,``There will be no definition of insider trading.''   He said his committee is drafting a bill that would ``implementneeded reforms'' and promised ``we will work toward passage thisyear.''   He did not elaborate what reforms would be in the bill, beyondadvising the association that ``you will probably dislike some ofthem.''   Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Dingell, said the chairmanfavors additional penalties for insider trading. He also wantsharsher treatment for violations of internal ``Chinese wall''barriers designed to prevent executives in a securities firminvolved in mergers and aquisitions from communicating with tradersin the same firm, Fitzgibbons said.   Fitzgibbons said Dingell is not philosophically opposed tolegislating a definition, but recognizes the difficulty of gettingCongress to agree on one and is comfortable with the definitiondeveloped by the courts.   Donald J. Crawford, a senior vice president for the securitiesassociation, said the group has endorsed a statutory definition butbelieves there is some validity to Dingell's arguments.   In a related matter, Dingell critized a bill passed last week bythe Senate Banking Committee that would permit banks to underwritemost securities, except corporate stocks.   Dingell said the bill provided insufficient safeguards againstconflicts between banks' role as lenders and what would becometheir new role as a securities underwriters.   The bill ``has emerged ... with firewalls as thin as ricepaper,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
