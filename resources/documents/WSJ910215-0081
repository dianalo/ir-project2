Defense chief Cheney hints that any initial ground attackin Kuwait should focus on flushing out Iraqi troops so alliedjets can bomb them. But senior Army officers fear suchtactics would play into Saddam Hussein's wish for a slow warof attrition. &quot;We'd lose a lot of people for too littlegain,&quot; argues one officer.</LP><TEXT>   The Army envisions multiple Israeli-style lightningassaults by air, land and sea. The hope is that Iraqi troops,weakened by the air war and stunned by a furious groundassault, would flee or surrender. Senior military officersalso privately oppose pressing the fight until PresidentHussein is toppled, as some politicians want.   The uproar over civilian deaths in the bombed Baghdadbunker could add to the friction if U.S. leaders pull back onattacking Iraqi command centers.                                                                                                          QUESTIONS REMAIN about some U.S. weapons untested inground combat.   Some military experts ballyhoo fuel-air bombs, which spewout an explosive vapor over the battlefield that cansuffocate soldiers in trenches. But many U.S. commanders areskeptical. While such bombs may provide a psychologicalweapon to deter Iraqi chemical attacks, they are effectiveonly over relatively small areas. And few pilots haveexperience using them.   Pilots of Blackhawk helicopters also are wary of usingnight-vision goggles on low-altitude missions. And despitecrash Pentagon orders, troops report a shortage oflaser-equipped devices to help antitank weapons find theirtargets. But the military is heartened by results so far onthe M1 tank, Apache helicopters and long-rangemultiple-rocket launchers.                                                                                                          OPPOSITION MOUNTS to the Bush administration's plan tooverhaul banking.   &quot;There's something in there for everybody to hate,&quot; saysJames Watt, president of the Conference of State BankSupervisors. His group and the National Governors Associationworry that state powers to influence local lending andcollect taxes from banks could be reduced. Big banks dislikerestricting deposit insurance.   Even backers of the plan, which would let banks branchnationwide and team up with brokerage and insurance firms,oppose certain parts. Merrill Lynch, for one, campaigns hardagainst limits on brokered deposits. The Treasury vows toresist &quot;attempts to cut the proposal to pieces&quot; when Congressstarts hearings late this month.   The administration expects business groups and lawmakersworried about the credit crunch to rally around its plan.                                                                                                          OFFICIALS DEBATE releasing evidence to back up U.S. claimsthat the Baghdad bunker bombed with civilians inside was amilitary facility. Pentagon officials considered showingsatellite photos of the bunker, but intelligence agenciesvetoed the idea. Some political leaders push to releaseintercepted radio signals from the site.                                                                                                          HELPFUL HINT? The CIA starts adorning the cover of itsdaily reports on the foreign press with photos of numerousworld leaders. Prominent among them: Saddam Hussein. He'spositioned between the late Romanian dictator NicolaiCeausescu and former Ugandan despot Idi Amin -- both of whomwere ousted in coups.                                                                                                          CONGRESS IS LIKELY to shoot down Bush's request for heftyspending on space-based weapons for Star Wars. Backers stillwant to spend nearly $6 billion a year by the mid-1990s forsuch weapons. But lawmakers appear determined to focus SDIlargely on cheaper, ground-based systems.                                                                                                          A NEW NEWT? Conservative activists grumble that combativeGOP Rep. Gingrich, who led a failed revolt against Bush's taxproposals last year, now is cozying up to the White House. Headmonishes a conservative gathering to fight Democrats, notthe GOP president. He drops co-sponsorship of a payrolltax-cut bill that Bush opposes.                                                                                                          CHOICE'S CHANCES: Educators face a tougher fight againstschool choice plans.   Education unions attack Bush's plan for grant programs tolet parents pick where their kids go to school, public orprivate. If the White House thinks funding for privateschools &quot;will vastly improve education, it is sadlymistaken,&quot; declares Albert Shanker of the American Federationof Teachers. The National Education Association vows to helpsink Bush's plan in Congress.   But the idea of school choice draws an unusual coalitionof backers, including conservatives, liberals and blacks. &quot;Ithink this year, for the first time, the dynamics are movingvery much in favor of choice,&quot; says Clint Bolick of theLandmark Center for Civil Rights. Critics accuse theeducation unions of trying to preserve the schoolbureaucracies that employ their members.   Incoming Education Secretary Alexander is expected to be amuch more effective advocate of school choice than previouseducation chief Cavazos was.
