This announcement is intended to promote awarenessof a potential eligibility criterion for access to the Gulf of Mexico sharkfishery. It is also intended to discourage new entries into the fisherybased on economic speculation while the Council continues discussions onwhether and how fishery access to the shark resource  should be controlled.This announcement does not prevent establishment of any other date foreligibility in the fishery or another method of controlling fishing effortfrom being proposed by the Council or being implemented by the Secretaryof Commerce (Secretary).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Rodney C. Dalton, NMFS, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>NMFS prepared a Preliminary Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Billfishesand Sharks (PMP) in 1978 (January 27, 1978, 43 FR 3818). The Council prepareda draft fishery management plan for sharks of the Gulf of Mexico in 1980,but did not submit it to the Secretary for review and implementation becausedomestic harvest was well below the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levelat that time. More recently, a significant market has developed for sharkproducts, and current data on harvest and incidental mortality indicatethat the MSY for Gulf sharks is being exceeded. The Secretary, therefore,is proceeding to prepare and implement a fishery management plan (FMP)for the shark fishery in both the Gulf and Atlantic. The Council will holdpublic hearings, and prepare an FMP amendment concerning the Gulf fisheryas necessary  and submit it for Secretarial approval and implementation.This notice is not part of the proposed Secretarial FMP.The Gulf of Mexico shark fishing industry has requested the Council todevelop alternative limited access systems, applicable to the Gulf sharkfishery, for public review as soon as possible. The Council and the Gulfshark fishing industry are concerned that those using longline vesselsin the reef fish, swordfish, and tuna fisheries may elect to enter theGulf shark fishery because harvest restrictions are being placed on theirpresent fisheries and catches in those fisheries are declining. Becausethe current fishing fleet is capable of annually harvesting the entireshark MSY for the Gulf of Mexico, any additional fishing effort would resultin harvesting inefficiencies, increased risks to the health of shark stocks,and the need for greater management constraints. The Council believes thatit should begin immediately to address these potential problems by identifyingeffective alternative controls on fishing effort. Such controls contemplatedby the Council include those that govern access to the Gulf shark fishery.At its meeting of July 10-13, 1989, the Council voted to establish September1, 1989, as a control date for new entrants into the Gulf shark fishery.To assist the Council, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA,has agreed to publish this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing that anyone entering the Gulf sharkfishery after the control date will not be assured of future participationshould the Council develop, and the Secretary approve and implement, aneffort-controlled fishery management regime limiting the number of participantsin the fishery. NMFS was unable to publish this notice on or before September1, therefore, the date published will inform affected fishermen in a moretimely manner. In establishing a control date and making this announcement, the Councilintends to discourage speculative entry into the shark fishery while theCouncil discusses possible limited entry or access-controlled managementregimes for the fishery. As the Council discusses development of a limitedentry or access-control management regime, certain fishermen who do notcurrently fish for sharks in the Gulf of Mexico, and never have done so,may decide to enter the fishery for the sole purpose of establishing arecord of making commercial shark landings. Such a record generally maybe considered indicative of economic dependence on the fishery; on thisbasis, such fishermen may successfully lay claim to access to a shark fisherywhich the Council may intend to be limited to traditional participants.New fishery entrants subsequent to the establishment of any limited entryor access-controlled system may have to buy the fishing rights or a permitfrom an existing participant. Hence, initial access to the fishery at littleor no cost may result in a windfall gain when selling an access right toa new entrant subsequent to establishment of a limited entry or accessprogram. When management authorities begin to consider use of a limited access managementregime, speculative entry into a fishery often is responsible for a rapidincrease in fishing effort in fisheries already fully or over-developed.Those seeking possible windfall gain from a possible management changecan exacerbate the original problems. To help distinguish bona fide andestablished shark fishermen from speculative entrants to the fishery, afishery  management council may set a control date before beginning discussionsand planning of limited access regimes. As a result, fishermen are notifiedthat entering the fishery after that date will not necessarily assure themof future access to the fishery resource on grounds of previous participation.This announcement establishes October 16, 1989 as a control date for potentialuse by the Council in determining historical or traditional participationin the Gulf of Mexico shark fishery. This action does not commit the Councilor the Secretary to any particular management regime or criterion for entryto the shark fishery. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participationin the shark fishery regardless of their date of entry or intensity ofparticipation in the fishery before or after the control date. The Councilmay subsequently choose a different control date, or it may choose a managementregime that does not make use of such a date. The Council is free to applyother qualifying criteria for fishery entry, such as documentation of commerciallandings and sales before the control date. The Council may give varying considerations to fishermen in the fisherybefore and after the control date. Finally, the Council may choose alsoto take no further action to control entry or access to the fishery. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Chapter VI </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
