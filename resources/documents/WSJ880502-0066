Beebe Sr., in a surprise move, pled guilty to two counts of bank fraud involving a Texas thrift and a small Louisiana bank.    A federal judge ordered Mr. Beebe to serve a prison term of one year and a day beginning late next month, according to an Associated Press report. Until now, Mr. Beebe, who had been indicted four times in recent years and convicted once, had not been sentenced to jail.    Federal officials have called Mr. Beebe one of the ringleaders of a group of highflying Texas bank and thrift owners who brought down their institutions through self-dealing and making &quot;back-scratching&quot; loans to each other. Mr. Beebe has had ties to scores of financial institutions over the years, including Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, of Vernon, Texas, whose collapse from unsound -- regulators say fraudulent -- lendings prompted a $1.3 billion federal bailout last year, the largest ever for a thrift.    Mr. Beebe was found guilty in 1985 of loan fraud and was ordered to perform community service work in a probated sentence. He was later acquitted in a separate case on related charges. The most recent case, in which he was accused of bank fraud and theft, ended last October in a hung jury.    Mr. Beebe, who lives in Shreveport, La., and Dallas, entered the pleas at a pretrial hearing late Friday. He pled guilty to conspiracy for arranging a 1984 loan from a small Louisiana bank to one of his associates, and for aiding and abetting wire fraud in connection wi th a $4.4 million loan from State Savings Association, Lubbock, Texas, made in 1983. </TEXT></DOC>
