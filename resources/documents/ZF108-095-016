 The disk icon never appears on the desktop because the disk nevermakes it past its own self-test.andP;  Fortunately, this problem doesn't affectstored data.andM;Apple's 40-megabyte Seagate model #ST1576 drive has a problem that Applecalls stiction.andP;  Sometimes the read/write heads stick to the disk platter andkeep the disk from spinning.andP;  Because the heads normally rest in a specialnondata area, this doesn't harm the data -- but you can't read it either.andO;When Apple's Quantum 40- and 80-megabyte drives start up, the heads may getstuck, preventing the disk from being properly recognized and causing randomsystem crashes.andM;Apple maintains that it will repair or replace sticky hard disks -- eventhose with expired warranties.andP;  Moreover, it'll reimburse users who have hadtheir Apple hard disks serviced at their own expense.andP;  Apple has evenannounced a formal recall on Seagate 40-megabyte drives with serial numbers335507 to 1250863.andM;Quantum drives with PROM version 7.9 01 should be dealer-upgraded to versionTA.201.andP;  The PROM chip is mounted onto the drive's controller board.andP;  Thereplacement offer will end after October 1991.andM;Apple has also promised to recover the data stored on faulty drives.andP;  In anycase, however, the company couldn't do it.andP;  If you have a sticky Apple disk,call Apple customer service at (408) 252-2775.andM;Beta Watch: NortonandM;Utilities for the MacintoshandM;Peter Norton Computing has pioneered the concept of disk-diagnosis and-recovery software on the PC.andP;  The company is now working on a Mac versionthat it has vowed not to release until it's up to the high standards set byits PC products.andM;The goal is to combine the detailed reporting and meaningful diagnostics of1stAid Kit with the robust recovery power of SUM II.andM;A peek at an alpha version of the software looked promising.andP;  If the releaseversion of Norton Utilities for the Mac is anywhere near as good as promised,it will give SUM II and 1stAid HFS a run for your money.andP;  Look for a releasein the first quarter of 1990.andP;

 It has an easy-to-use cdev for listing andrecovering deleted fils and can recover what's left of deleted files whosesectors have been partly reassigned to new files.andM;Pros: Provides a summary of each deleted file's quality.andP;  Deleted files canbe viewed and sorted in several ways.andP;  Can recover and render openabledeleted and partly reassigned files.andM;Cons: Can undelete only files that have been deleted after you installed theutility into your Systm Folder.andM;Requires: Mac 512KE or later.andM;List Price: $49.95.andM;1stAid Software, 42 Radnor Road, Boston, MA 02135; (617) 783-7118.andM;1stAid HFS 2.8andM;1stAid HFS combines disk diagnostics and general-purpose troubleshooting withan excellent file-recovery facility.andP;  It can generate a summary of a disk'scondition and suggest recovery options.andP;  Also available is a package called1stAid Kit Deluxe that contains 1stAid HFS, Complete Undelete, and SectorCollector.andM;Pros: You know in advance the quality of what's recovered.andP;  Ability torecover files from damaged floppies is excellent.andM;Cons: Recovery system depends on the prior installation of its protectiveutility.andP;  Can't recover files from hard disks that have destroyeddirectories.andP;  Lacks a facility for maintaining a duplicate copy of the diskdirectory.andM;Requires: Mac 512KE or later.andM;List Price: 1stAid HFS, $99.95; 1stAid Kit Deluxe, $159.95.andM;1stAid Software, 42 Radnor Road, Boston, MA 02135; (617) 783-7118.andM;PC Tools DeluxeandM;PC Tools Deluxe is a collection of utilities for disk and file handling.andP;  Itincludes a utility that stores a duplicate disk directory on the same oranother drive.andP;  A companion application uses the duplicate directory torecover a hard disk if its working directory is damaged.andM;Pros: Does deleted-file recovery for hard disks and floppies and includes afloppy-disk-recovery application that uses sector tags.andP;  Other utilities letyou do encryption, disk backup, and optimization.andP;  Good documentation that'snot for the fainthearted.andM;Cons: Duplicate directory for hard-disk recovery is updated only on systemshutdown.andP;  Lacks an easy-to-use hard-disk file-recovery capability if youhave not preinstalled its protective utility.andP;  PC Backup backs up one harddisk to another but presumes that you've backed up to floppies, even thoughit lets you back up to a hard disk.andM;Requires: Mac 512KE or later with 800K internal drive.andM;List Price: $79.95.andM;Central Point Software, 15220 N. Greenbrier Parkway, Beaverton, OR 97006;(503) 690-8090.andM;Sector Collector 1.0andM;Sector Collector is a handly diagnosis-and-repair utility for detecting andisolating bad disk sectors.andP;  It can recover files by collecting good sectorsand replacing bad ones.andP;  It can also optionally take bad sectors out ofcirculation.andP;  It verifies disk and generates reports.andM;Pros: Bad-sector-assignment method is workable and easy to undo.andM;Cons: Reformatting a disk releases the bad sectors for use unless you collectthem immediately.andM;Requires: Mac 512KE or later.andM;List Price: $49.95.andM;1stAid Software, 42 Radnor Road, Boston, MA 02135; (617) 783-7118.andM;SUM II 2.0andM;SUM II can work wonders in recovering deleted files or dat from a crasheddisk.andP;  Once SUM II is installed, its recovery methods are based on the VolumeRestore Record, which can be updated at specified intervals, and the DeletedFile Record.andM;Pros: Recovers and undeletes data from disks with damaged directories, evenwhen no preventive measures have been previously taken.andM;Cons: No warning when a disk sector in a recovered file can't be read.andP;  SUMTune-up's method of reassigning bad blocks on detection should be an optionrather than a no-choice event.andM;Requires: Mac Plus or later, System 4.2 or later, and Finder 6.0 or later.andM;List Price: $149.95.andM;Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014; (408) 253-9600.andM;The Bottom LineandM;Right now, no single product provides all the features you need for hard-diskdiagnosis and recovery.andP;  1stAid Kit is easy to use, provides meaningfulreports, and is great for floppy disks, but it can't recover the contents ofa hard disk if the directory is badly damaged.andP;  SUM II can recover disks withdamaged or destroyed directories, but it doesn't warn you about any badsectors in the recovered files, so you can never quite trust the quality ofthe recovery.andM;Complete Undelete, with its partial-recovery and text-extraction features,provides the best deleted-file recovery, as long as you have preinstalled thesoftware.andM;PC Tools Deluxe has a hard-disk file-recovery capability that producesacceptable recoveries only if just the disk directory is damaged.andP;  It alsooffers a deleted-file-recovery system that requires preinstallation.andP;  Withfiles that have been partly overwritten, however, its recovery methods failto produce recovered files that their creating application can read.andP;  By allmeans, install a file-and-disk-watch-dog utility before you find that youneed one.andM;SUM has the widest set of capabilities for a single package, but acombination of SUM II and 1stAid HFS makes a far safer and more complete kitfor diagnosis, recovery, and repair.andP;  If you can afford it, buy SUM II,1stAid HFS, Complete Undelete, and Sector Collector, as they can each provevital for some aspect of recovery.andM;How Deleted-File Recovery Was TestedandM;I deleted several files, including a long MacWrite file, from an Apple80-megabyte hard disk.andP;  I also wrote other files to the disk to deliberatelyoverwrite some of the deleted files' sectors.andP;  I then tried to recover thesefiles with SUM II, PC Tools Deluxe, and Complete Undelete.andM;Complete UndeleteandM;This tool gave me a comprehensive list of deleted files.andP;  When I selected myMacWrite file, it told me 49 of the original 147 sectors were missing.andP;  ThePreview feature showed that a large block of text could be recovered.andP;  I thenrecovered the file twice -- once by extracting the text and once by zeroingout the reallocated sectors, and replacing them with empty ones.andP;  Both Wordand MacWrite were able to read and work with the resulting versions of thefile.andP;  Complete Undelete was the only software that consistently recovereddeleted files, whether they were intact or partially overwritten.andP;  Considerthis as a mandatory feature.andM;PC Tools DeluxeandM;This application's MacTools utility provides two methods for recoveringdeleted files on hard disks: CPS Delete Tracking and the Resource ForksMethod.andP;  The Resource Forks Method failed to locate many deleted files,perhaps because the files lacked resource forks.andP;  With CPS Delete Tracking, Itried to recover several files that PC Tools Deluxe listed as being completeand recoverable, but I was unable to open the recovered files.andM;SUM IIandM;I tested deleted-file recovery by using the Scan and Deleted File Recordoptions.andP;  The Deleted File Record recovery of my partially overwrittenMacWrite file generated a recovered file I could not open with MacWrite orMicrosoft Word 4.0.andP;  I did finally manage to view the text using 1stAid Kit.andO;The search with Scan failed to find several deleted files, including the longMacWrite file I wanted to recover.andM;Capsule ReviewsandM;PC Tools DeluxeandM;The PC Tools Deluxe package is not a viable disk-recovery system, because itfails to provide any hard-disk file-recovery capability.andP;  It does include afloppy-disk-recovery application, which uses sector tags, and two-tiereddeleted-file recovery for hard disks and floppies.andP;  In my tests, however,neither method worked very well with files that were partly overwritten.andP;  PCTools Deluxe's file-undeletion system, CPS Delete Tracking, is unable toinstall on the same system as SAM (Symantec's virus detector) or 1stAid Kit'sAnti-Virus.andM;The only hard-disk-recovery feature it includes is an application calledMirror that stores a duplicate directory on the same or another drive.andP;  Acompanion application called Rebuild can restore the directory from theduplicate.andP;  The Mirror directory is updated only on system shutdown, so theRebuild application loses any new data files created since the system wasturned on.andP;  This approach can easily overwrite directory information that SUMII or 1stAid HFS can use to recover your disk.andM;The manual's cover promises &quot;Disk Recovery: Recover data from magneticallydamaged diskettes and hard disks.&quot;andP;  However, the system does not have asingle feature that can recover data from magnetically damaged hard disks,unless only the directory is damaged.andM;The package claims to have &quot;the best undelete available.andP;  Instead ofguessing, it recovers data even from fragmented files.&quot;andP;  When I tried usingeither of its recovery schemes, I was unable to recover and open files inwhich some sectors had been overwritten.andM;When I used PC Tools Deluxe's dedicated function, PC Backup, to back up onehard disk to another, I couldn't recover the backup, because the restoreprocess presumed that I had backed up to floppies, even though it let me backup to a hard-disk volume.andP;  When I ran the Verify Disk function, the cursorremained an arrow, leaving me only hoping that the verification was running.andO;Although it does not fix bad sectors, it reports each error and its sectornumber, stopping each time to wait for your acknowledgement.andP;  It doesn'tproduce a final report, nor does it tell you what file the bad blocks belongto.andM;PC Tools Deluxe may be a dandy set of techy utilities, but for disk recovery,it falls somewhat short.andP;  It looks as though it was brought to market toosoon.andP;  Central Point Software says it will fix all these problems andintroduce real recovery features in the next release.andM;1stAid HFSandM;1stAid HFS combines meaningful disk diagnostics with an excellentfile-recovery facility and a general-purpose troubleshooting guide for theMac.andP;  It lacks a scavenging capability for hard disks, so it cannot recoverdisks whose directories are destroyed.andP;  However, through its detailed reportsabout recovered files, you know the quality of what it does recover.andO;Unfortunately, 1stAid HFS also lacks a facility for maintaining a duplicatecopy of the disk directory, which removes a strong line of defense againstcrashes.andP;  Its recovery capabilities for floppy disks are excellent, however.andO;Even if you use it only to recover flaky floppies, no Mac should be without1stAid HFS.andM;The software comes with a wealth of detailed documentation.andP;  In fact, it isoften too detailed.andP;  It took a call to customer support before it becameobvious that the lists containing cross-referenced error messages, keywords,and descriptions of abnormal behaviors are crucial recovery tools.andP;  Theselists are hidden in the middle of the manual.andP;  When you get an error message,the Error Message List references the page on which you can find theappropriate solution.andP;  It would significantly improve the manual if this keyfeature were presented up front.andM;Floppy-Disk Recovery.andP;  1stAid HFS' ability to recover files from damagedfloppies is no less than spectacular.andP;  It repeatedly recovered more data fromdamaged floppies than did SUM II.andP;  It has several modes of floppy recoveryand a Quick Cure option.andP;  Diagnose and Recover is the same directory-basedrecovery technique that 1stAid HFS uses to analyze and recover hard disks.andO;The Quick Cure option scans the directory, generates a diagnosis of the disk,and offers recovery options.andM;You can select some or all of the files to be recovered.andP;  As 1stAid HFSproceeds, it warns you about files with bad sectors that it had to replacewith empty ones.andP;  In my experience, especially with floppies, sectors thatare unreadable in one attempt may be readable on the next try.andP;  If you makerepeated attempts to recover a file containing bad sectors, you caneventually recover the entire file.andM;Salvage Files by Tags is a sector-by-sector scan-and-salvage recoverytechnique that may be able recover some data from floppies too damaged forany other technique to work.andP;  It uses sector tags, which are short datafields at the beginning of each in-use sector that contain the identity ofthe file that owns them.andP;  Using tags as a guide, this utility can recoverdata even if the floppy's directory has been destroyed.andP;  Mac hard disks,unfortunately, lack sector tags.andM;Copy Diskette is the easiest but least effective method for recovering floppydisks.andP;  It attempts to copy the files from one floppy to another, sector bysector, summarizing how many bad sectors had to be replaced with zeroed-outplaceholding sectors.andM;1stAid HFS can also view and extract the text in files.andP;  I found thisespecially useful for recovering text from Word 4.0 Temp files, which containthe latest state of your Word document and remain on-disk after a crash.andM;Complete UndeleteandM;Complete Undelete from 1stAid Software is a powerful and easy-to-use utility,accessed through the Control Panel, for listing and recovering deleted files.andO;It can recover what's left of deleted files, some of whose sectors have beenreassigned to new files.andP;  You have the options of replacing the missingsectors or of extracting any available text.andP;  Complete Undelete can undeleteonly files that have been deleted after you have installed the utility intoyour System Folder.andP;  It was able to recover and render openable deleted andpartly reassigned files that SUM II and PC Tools Deluxe could not recover.andO;SUM II and PC Tools Deluxe, on the other hand, were able to recover somefiles that were deleted before any deleted-file protection was installed.andM;Complete Undelete provides a summary of all deleted files, showing which onescan be recovered intact.andP;  You can view deleted files by date of deletion,alphabetically by name, or by creator, which is handy if you want to recovera specific file.andM;When you select a file for recovery, the program shows the number of sectorsin each deleted file, the number of missing sectors, and the percentage ofthe file that can be recovered.andP;  As a safety feature, Complete Undeletedoesn't try to recover partially overwritten applications.andP;  A convenientpreview section lets you look at deleted files before they are recovered andeven extract any available text.andM;Sector CollectorandM;Sector Collector is a handy diagnosis-and-repair utility for detecting andisolating bad sectors on hard disks and floppies.andP;  Although it can be used byitself, Sector Collector was designed to be used with 1stAid HFS.andP;  It canrecover files by collecting their good sectors and replacing their bad ones.andM;It verifies the disk and generates a detailed report, but it does notautomatically lock out bad sectors, which would permanently prevent theirreuse.andP;  Instead, it has a unique option for assigning unused bad sectors toan invisible file; this approach takes bad sectors out of circulation so theydon't get assigned to your good files.andP;  Sector Collector also has a recoveryoption for recovering files that are partially composed of bad sectors.andM;The separation of the sector-validation and collection functions is importantbecause certain types of SCSI-bus or system problems can make it look asthough you have many bad sectors on a good disk.andP;  If the verification detectsmore than a couple of bad sectors, you can repeat the verification severaltimes and then take corrective action.andM;SUM IIandM;SUM II is a set of utilities that includes data-recovery anddata-loss-prevention tools.andP;  SUM II is the only recovery application that canrecover data from disks whose directories have been damaged and for which nopreventive measures have been previously taken.andP;  Unfortunately, SUM IIdoesn't tell you when it can't read a bad disk sector, so you don't know if afile has been successfully recovered until you try to use it.andP;  Runningincompletely recovered applications can cause serious problems.andM;After the Crash.andP;  SUM II can search a disk for recoverable files and can alsolocate and undelete files, even if you've never loaded it on your systembefore.andP;  It can take hours to scan a large disk, but considering thealternative, it's worth the wait.andP;  SUM doesn't generate its foundfile reportuntil the scan has finished, so if you interrupt a search, the time investedup to that point is wasted.andP;  Once it has listed the files, it can sort themby name, type, and date.andM;SUM's Floppy Recover option can help extract floppy-based data, but in myattempts, the recovered files proved unusable.andP;  According to Symantec, FloppyRecover is the least effective recovery method and should be used only if theVolume Scan option fails to recover all the known files.andM;Before the Crash.andP;  SUM Shield is a preventive utility that creates a copy ofyour disk's directory in a Volume Restore Record and keeps a record ofdeleted files in a Deleted File Record.andP;  You can keep both records or copythem onto another disk and update them whenever you update the original,which gives you an extra measure of protection.andP;  If your disk's own directoryis damaged, SUM can use its Volume Restore Record to locate files quickly.andO;If the disk suffers a hardware crash, this can make the difference betweenrecovery and loss.andM;You can update the Volume Restore Record at specified intervals with akeyboard command or have it done automatically at specified intervals or whenyou shut down.andP;  If you use your Mac intensively, you will want to specifyfrequent updates.andP;  Unfortunately, even under MultiFinder, thedirectory-backup process temporarily interrupts the current application,which some fax utilities and communications applications may not tolerate.andO;Using a timed backup can be a godsend, but it has potential dangers becauseyou may have files open or in transitional states.andM;Undeleting Files.andP;  If you discover that you've accidentally deleted animportant file and you don't have a recent backup or a deleted-file-recoverypackage installed, SUM II is your only hope.andP;  Although its scan method isn'tfoolproof, it gives you a fighting chance.andP;  SUM II's recovery based on thepreinstalled Deleted File Record provides a more reliable and painlessrevival in most cases.andP;  As with its other file-recovery methods, SUM IIdoesn't report bad-sector problems with recovered files.andM;SUM II's disk-repair side includes SUM Tune-up, which can detect andautomatically lock out bad sectors, as long as the sectors are not alreadyassigned to a file.andP;  Unfortunately, SUM II lacks a scan-only diagnostic mode.andO;The automatic sector lockout could be dangerous if some problem in your diskcable or connector falsely indicated bad blocks, and it could cause loss of agreat deal of disk space by having good blocks rendered inaccessible.andM;External DisksandM;Choose Shut Down from the Special menu, and then turn off the Mac and thedrive.andP;  Check to ensure that the SCSI addresses on all your devices areunique.andP;  Be especially careful to check the address of any internal harddisks.andP;  No two SCSI devices can have the same address (0 through 6), soassign each a different number.andP;  Check SCSI cables for proper seating at bothends.andP;  Never disconnect or connect a SCSI cable when the Mac or any sCSIperipheral is powered up.andM;Electronic NoiseandM;An improperly terminated SCSI chain can make the Mac think a disk has failed.andO;Check the hardware documentation, and make sure that the hard-disk drive hasa SCSI terminator if it needs one.andP;  If the disk is the last device in theSCSI chain, it should be terminated.andP;  When you've checked these particulars,turn on the drive, wait a minute, and then start your Mac.andP;  If your attemptsdon't solve the problem, turn everything off again and physical disconnectany other SCSI devices from the chain.andP;  Power up and hope for the best.andP;  Ifyou have a spare compatible SCSI cable, now's the time to try it.andP;  With anyharddisk drive, try turning the Mac off and on again.andP;  You may need to dothis several times.andM;Dirty Desktops and Bad DriversandM;Corruption of either the desktop file or the SCSI-disk-driver software canlook like a disk failure.andP;  If the desktop file gets damaged, the Finder maynot even display the disk's icon, instead displaying the message &quot;This diskneeds minor repairs.&quot;andP;  You can rebuild the desktop by using the Minor Repairsapplication, which comes with 1stAid HFS, or by holding down the Command andOption keys at startup and clicking OK at the offer to rebuild the desktop ofthe problem disk.andM;The SCSI disk driver is the software on your hard disk that loads into theMac at startup and handles Macdisk communications.andP;  A driver gone bad lookslike a hard-disk crash.andP;  The driver for Apple hard disks is installed withthe Update option by the Apple HD SC Setup utility on the Macintosh UtilitiesDisk #1.andP;  The drivers for other hard disks should come on an included floppy.andO;If you have any questions about reinstalling a specific driver, you shouldcall the disk's vendor.andM;Because of oneway in Apple's SCSI implementation, your current SCSI driverwaynot be compatible with a new release of the Mac's System.andP;  If you've justupdated your system software and you start to have problems for no obviousreason, consider going back to your trsty old System setup.andP;  If that curesthe problem, you should report the problem to the disk's manufacturer and askif there is an updated version of the driver available.andM;Norman Fong of FWB Software, which develops SCSI drivers, notes that the newMac Portable and the Mac IIci use a checksum feature that has been part ofthe sCSI spec but that Apple has not enforced up to now.andP;  As a result,disk-driver combinations that work on the Mac II, IIcx, and SE may not workon the Portable or IIci series.andM;Call the Drive VendorandM;If you're still having trouble with a harddisk drive, call the disk vendor'scustomer-support line.andP;  Support people often hear of obscure disk problemsthat may baffle your dealer.andM;You may know that sinking feeling you get when you realize that all yourdisk's data and the hard work it represents may be lost.andP;  You ask theuniverse why your disk has suddenly gone deader than astack of hubcaps, andyou wonder why you haven't taken the time to back up your work.andP;  Once a diskproblem does occur, however, there's a lot you can do to recover most or allof your data.andM;First, be aware that the Mac Finder generates apocryphal warnings at theslightest disk disturbance, making it impossible to tell a minor problem froma hard crash.andP;  To make matters worse, it then offers to reinitialize the diskand destroy all its data.andP;  The chances are very good that your disk data isstill safe and sound and that you can recover most if not all your files.andO;Genuine crashes, in which the disk is damaged beyond recovery, are very rare.andM;Don't accept any offer the system makes to &quot;repair&quot; the disk.andP;  In most cases,it can do so, but in attempting to repair it, the system can inadverttentlyfurther corrupt vital recovery information.andP;  You can try to repair the diskafter you've safely recovered its data.andP;  The major cause of loss of data indisk crashes is panic.andP;  If you start to reinitialize the disk by accident,shut off the drive's power switch.andP;  This is bad for the disk, and it goesagainst all your instincts, but it still beats losing all your data.andM;Opening a Damaged diskandM;If the Mac is unable to mount a damaged disk from the Finder, it may issue anerror message and/or refuse to display the disk's icon, making it unreachableby ordinary means.andP;  You may, however, be able to access that disk with 1stAid HFS or SUM II.andP;  If the damaged disk is your System disk, you'll need torestart the system with another System disk or the 1st Aid HFS or SUMdistribution floppy.andP;  Always remember to lock the master floppy or, betteryet, use a working copy of it.andM;Problems with FloppiesandM;If you have a damaged floppy, immediately eject and lock it to preventaccidental erasure or further corruption during file recovery.andP;  Try insertingthe floppy into the drive several times.andP;  Often this is enough to correct theproblem.andP;  Then try inserting the floppy into a different drive or a differentMac.andP;  Sometimes the slight difference in head alignment between drives isenough to make the floppy readable.andP;  If there are fingerprints or dirt on themedium, the heads may actually scrape it clean during repeated read attempts.andO;Even waiting for better weather might help.andP;  I once had a disk that seemedparticularly sensitive to humidity levels: If it rained for a few days, thedisk would flake out; after a few days of dry weather, it would mountperfectly.andM;If your initial efforts still give you the &quot;This disk is unreadable&quot; message,eject the disk and run a floppy-disk-recovery program.andP;  1stAid HFS is theeasiest and most reliable floppy-disk-recovery software.andP;  You can even try tomake a sector copy of the disk, but not with the reluctant Finder.andP;  You canuse a sector-copy program such as FastCopy, which comes with PC Tools Deluxe,or SUM's QuickCopy utility.andP;  Such programs can repair certain types ofdirectory damage so that the disk can at least be recognized by the Finder.andM;Whatever the cause or cure, once your disk has been recognized and its iconappears, copy its contents to another disk and try to use the rescued data.andO;Once you're satisfied that it's all there, make a second copy, using the newdisk as a master, and give the damaged disk a nice burial.andM;Recover Your Files FirstandM;If disk-revival steps fail, you'll have to recover individual files, althoughthere may be some data you can't recover.andP;  What you get and what you don'tget depend on the extent of the damage and the built-in wits of your recoverysoftware.andP;  Don't create any new files on the problem disk or attempt to printuntil you have safely recovered your data.andP;  The more you exercise the disk,the greater the danger of damaging the data or medium.andP;  If you are able to,seek out your most valuable files and rescue them first.andM;Several software tool kits can recover files from most crashed hard disks anddamaged floppies.andP;  I tested five such packages - 1stAid HFS, CompleteUndelete, and Sector Collector, all from 1stAid Software; SUM II, fromSymantec; and PC Tools Deluxe, from Central Point Software.andP;  1stAid HFS isunequaled in floppy-disk recovery.andP;  SUM II has the unique ability to scan abadly damaged disk and scavenge for recoverable data, even if the directoryhas been destroyed.andP;  It can sometimes recover data from an accidentallyinitialized disk too.andP;  PC Tools Deluxe is the weakest of the packages, andits current release is not the best choice for disk recovery.andM;Another disk-recovery package, Norton Utilities for the Mac, from PeterNorton Computing, is still in development and may be available by the timeyour read this (see the &quot;BetaWatch&quot; sidebar).andM;Recovering Deleted FilesandM;When you delete a file, the system doesn't actually erase the data in sectorsoccupied by the deleted file -- it merely erases that file's name from thedisk directory and frees up its sectors for use by new files.andP;  Because nodata is lost, it is frequently possible to recover it, but the longer youwait after deleting a file, the greater the probability of overwriting itssectors with new data.andP;  If you accidentally delete a file, you must recoverit immediately.andM;Complete Undelete, PC tools Deluxe, and SUM II provide simple directory-basedmethods for recovering deleted files.andP;  Complete Undelete and PC Tools Deluxecan recover only files deleted after the programs' deleted-file trackingsystem was installed.andP;  SUM II, on the other hand, is the only software thatcan recover files that were deleted before a deleted-file tracking system wasinstalled.andM;Leonard Hindus is CEO of Ribbledale Communications, Inc., a certifiedMacintosh developer and marketing-communications service located in Hudson,Massachusetts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
