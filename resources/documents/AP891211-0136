Sakharov appeared to fizzle Monday, with onlyabout 1,500 participants reported in Moscow and scattered supportaround the country.   Scientists at research institutes were the main workers in thecapital to heed the strike call to demand an end to Communist Partydomination, an aide to the Nobel Peace Prize laureate said.   There was little exact information about strikes elsewhere, butSakharov aide Alexander Sobyanin said his office received about 100telegrams from Soviet workplaces where walkouts took place and knewof about 1,500 scientists who took part.   Ivan T. Frolov, editor-in-chief of Pravda, said the strikeapparently ``didn't happen.''   ``I think it would be hard to imagine that in these conditions,after all we've lived through and are living through, that thispoorly thought-out strike call could meet understanding among thepublic,'' he told a news conference at the party newspaper'soffices.   Strikes have ravaged the struggling economy since summer, andofficials now warn that city-supplied steam heat could be affectedby a coal strike in an already bitter Russian winter.   Sakharov and other parliamentarians called for the strike topressure the Congress of People's Deputies to vote on rescindingArticle 6 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Communists the``leading and guiding role'' in society. They also want theCongress, which opens Tuesday, to act on several key reform laws.   Sakharov's move failed to win the support of a group of 400progressive parliamentarians. The Inter-Regional Group voted Sundayto favor the goal of rescinding Communist supremacy, but did notthrow its influence behind the call for a general strike. Memberssaid the public mood was too explosive.   Random checks of factories in Moscow bore out Frolov's claimthat the strike failed to materialize.   Sobyanin said despite the limited participation in the walkout,a permanent Moscow strike committee was being formed in case theneed arose for a walkout.   A highly successful two-hour strike Nov. 27 precededCzechoslovakia's recent decision to drop its version of Article 6from its constitution, and Hungary, Poland and East Germany havedone away with their equivalents of the clause as one after theother moved away from Communist one-party rule.   In the Baltic republic of Latvia, some store clerks andtransport workers called a halt for just 15 minutes to show theirsolidarity with Sakharov's call, said Maris Melans of the PopularFront newspaper Atmoda.   Lithuania's popular front, called Sajudis, saw no reason tostrike since its parliament voted last week to drop its version ofArticle 6 and legalize a multiparty system, said spokesmanGintautas Alyksenes. As a sign of solidarity with Sakharov's call,however, Sajudis called for a minute of silence, he said.   Estonia's Popular Front decided not to join the strike, even fortwo hours, because ``we have such terrible economic conditions, itwould make people's lives worse,'' said spokesman Paul Lepp.   Estonia's parliament is expected to follow Lithuania's example,throwing out its version of Article 6 and legalizing multiplepolitical parties within a month, Lepp said.   ``For all practical purposes, it's already removed,'' he said.Although only the Democratic Party of Labor of Estonia calleditself a political party in Sunday's elections, many otherpolitical movements fielded candidates, Lepp said.   Soviet TV's nightly news program, ``Vremya,'' like other Sovietmedia, carried nothing Monday on the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
