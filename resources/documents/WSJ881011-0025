Increasingly, the answer is to appoint someone else to do the heavy lifting. This surrogate -- called a special master -- might review documents and report on his results, manage the pre-trial fact-finding process, act as a settlement manager, or even dismiss cases.    There is no question that special masters have sometimes provided relief for the nation's congested court dockets by moving cases to trial more quickly and freeing up judges' schedules. Some have accomplished seemingly miraculous feats. Law professor Francis McGovern of the University of Alabama, for example, helped settle 500 asbestos cases in four years, saving an estimated $5 million in legal fees.    But some legal educators, judges and attorneys are skeptical of the trend. They are troubled, among other things, by the dangers in delegating too much judicial authority to non-judges. &quot;A special master's role can be as important as presiding over the trial,&quot; says Geoffrey C. Hazard, a law professor at Yale University.    Others worry that judges resort to special masters, who are often paid high hourly rates, all too casually. &quot;There are too many examples of judges reflexively handing things over to the special master,&quot; says Linda Silberman, a New York University law professor. &quot;It's on the edge of becoming a cottage industry within the legal profession.&quot;    Compensation for special masters is usually divided among litigants, but the bill can be paid out of any fund that the court controls, such as an estate of a firm in bankruptcy-law proceedings. When the government is a party in a case -- as it frequently is -- the taxpayer may end up paying part of the tab.    Although no one keeps statistics on special masters, Ms. Silberman says her studies indicate &quot;an extensive increase in their use over the last few years.&quot;    In one recent example, when a federal judge in a national-security case was faced with reviewing 14,000 pages of &quot;highly sensitive&quot; Defense Department documents, he appointed a private attorney as a special master to do the job.    The government protested, taking the issue to a U.S. appeals court. But the court ruled the special master &quot;would make life easier.&quot; The opinion said: &quot;Where a massive number of classified documents exists such that the judge and his law clerk simply cannot examine them all . . . a master to structure the judge's review is appropriate.&quot;    Product-liability cases with thousands of claimants are also breeding grounds for special masters. &quot;As the complexity of litigation and the problems of discovery are dramatically increasing, the courts are responding by bringing in more judicial surrogates,&quot; says Sol Schreiber, a lawyer at the New York law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach, who was a special master in the Agent Orange litigation.    Ms. Silberman sees the trend partly as an indication of inadequacy in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Rules, enacted in 1938, lack provisions for managing increasingly complex litigation, she says. The rule that allows for special masters isn't specific enough.    Under the rules, a judge has the power to appoint anyone as a special master and to determine how the master will be paid. There is no provision saying both sides in the suit have to agree on the appointment. &quot;You may object to the choice, but the judge is trying your case after all -- not exactly an incentive for speaking up against him,&quot; says Ms. Silberman.    Some critics point to the danger of cronyism in the choice of masters. In a recent case in the District of Columbia Superior Court, a defense attorney challenged the appointments of six different special masters during five years in one case. He called it &quot;a form of the judge's patronage.&quot; They were charging huge fees, he argued, but hadn't produced the required reports on the case.    An additional worry is that, while many special masters are law professors or former judges, some are attorneys in active private practice who may have conflicts of interest.    In another District of Columbia case, a special master was hired to resolve a six-year dispute stemming from the breakup of the Detroit law firm, Jenkins, Nystrom andamp; Sterlacci. But, at the same time, the special master was litigating in a separate case against Cole andamp; Groner, the law firm representing Michael Sterlacci -- a partner in the Detroit firm involved in the break-up dispute.    One indication that the debate over special masters is heating up, say lawyers, is an increase in appeals of the appointments and the lengthy discourses in opinions coming out of the courts.    Judge Kenneth Starr, of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, disagreed with the approval of a special master in a case last summer and wrote an extensive dissent. The courts shouldn't be so quick to sanction such extraordinary remedies, he said. He ended his opinion, &quot;The yellow light is flashing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
