Trying to do my share, I wasflicking my remote control the other day when I lit upon ahearing before the Joint Economic Committee. The chairman,Rep. Lee Hamilton, is interrogating Richard Darman, directorof the Office of Management and Budget. He asks Mr. Darmanhis opinion of the various ingredients in Rep. DanRostenkowski's proposal for balancing the budget. As Mr.Hamilton lists each proposal for a tax increase Mr. Darmanlooks at it, sniffs it, bites it, and then rejects it,saying, &quot;Not sufficiently pro-growth.&quot;   That kind of thing can occupy a couch potato for only solong, so I flick again and find Michael Boskin, chairman ofthe Council of Economic Advisers, explaining to the SenateFinance Committee that the reason to cut the capital-gainstax is to promote growth.</LP><TEXT>   Flick again, and there is John Sununu, the president'schief of staff, telling Judy Woodruff that the reason somepeople want a stronger environmental program than he does isthat they are &quot;anti-growth.&quot;   So I had to find out what has made &quot;growth&quot; the acid testby which all policies are judged. I turned to holy writ, theEconomic Report of the President, and there it was, on thefirst page:   &quot;The primary economic goal of my Administration is toachieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economicgrowth. Achieving this goal will require action on manyfronts -- but it will permit progress on many more. Growth isthe key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy ofprosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need,and to maintaining America's leadership in the world.&quot;   That is pretty strong stuff. Growth is not just &quot;a&quot; goalor &quot;an important&quot; goal; it is the &quot;primary&quot; goal. And thegoal is not just a high rate of growth: It is the &quot;highestpossible rate of sustainable growth.&quot; And growth is not just&quot;a&quot; key to a lot of good things: It is &quot;the&quot; key.   This could all be one grand tautology. &quot;Economic goal&quot;could be defined so narrowly that it is identical witheconomic growth, or &quot;economic growth&quot; could be defined sobroadly that it encompasses all good things. But whilecommitting tautology may not be an impeachable offense, Iprefer to believe that my president does not indulge in it.   So it may be worthwhile trying to parse out this paragraphon the assumption that it means something. If economic policycan have consequences other than consequences for economicgrowth, and if some of these other consequences may be good,what does it mean to say that the highest possible rate ofeconomic growth is the &quot;primary&quot; goal? Specifically, does itmean if Policy A yields more growth and less of some othergood thing than Policy B that Policy A is always to bechosen?   That would clearly be an absurd position. Taken literally,it would mean that the tiniest addition to growth is to bechosen at the sacrifice of no matter how much of some othergood thing. And the administration does not really mean that.Following the paragraph I have just quoted, the presidentlists the policies he proposes to achieve his goal. The firstis: &quot;Reduce government borrowing by slowing the growth ofFederal spending while economic growth raises revenue untilthe budget is balanced, and reduce the national debtthereafter.&quot;   But if that is a route to more growth, it is not the routeto the highest possible rate of growth. That would involvenot only slowing the growth of federal spending but alsosharply cutting expenditures for Social Security, Medicare,aid to farmers, defense and other things in order to reducethe deficit faster and get a bigger budget surplus. I supposethe administration does not propose that because it isunwilling to sacrifice some other objectives in order to getthe amount of additional growth that might result from doingso. When you say that, however, the notion of the primacy ofthe goal of the highest possible rate of economic growthcrumbles.   The proposition that economic growth is &quot;the key&quot; to a lotof good things, like &quot;uplifting those most in need,&quot; is anattempt to evade the consequences of the fact that there arevaluable objectives other than growth. I used to encounterthis proposition in its most outlandish form in argumentabout the defense budget:   A. A strong economy is the key to national security.   B. Cutting defense expenditures will make the economystronger.   C. Therefore, cutting defense expenditures is the key tonational security.   The relevant question is whether devoting certainresources to increasing economic growth is a more efficientway of achieving the other objectives -- such as nationalsecurity or uplifting the poor -- than devoting the sameresources directly to those purposes. The answer to that willsurely depend on the particular objectives and resourcesunder consideration. I am sure that in the defense case,spending more on defense did more for national security thanusing the same amount of money to reduce the deficit or cuttaxes would have done. I believe that the same is true ofuplifting the poor and exercising international leadership.At least, the question needs to be argued and the answer nottaken for granted, as tends to be done.   I think the administration is saying that when itencounters a choice between more growth and more of someother objective it leans in the direction of favoring growthmore than someone else -- Congress or Democrats or previousadministrations. This is a legitimate preference, likepreferring not to eat broccoli. But it is also legitimate tohave a different preference. The quality of discussion wouldbe improved if the administration would clarify its choices.   For example, the administration might say about thecapital-gains tax: &quot;We recognize that a preferential rate forcapital gains violates the valuable principle of equity intaxation, but we believe that the resulting gain in economicgrowth is worth that sacrifice of principle.&quot; Or about theenvironment it might say: &quot;We recognize that theenvironmental measures that others propose would make lifeless short and nasty, but we prefer to sacrifice that gainfor the sake of more rapid economic growth.&quot; Then we couldtalk about the quantities and values involved, instead ofdividing up into pro-growth and anti-growth factions.   I suppose that anyone who reads between my lines can seethat I do not share the high priority the administrationasserts for rapid economic growth as a goal of governmentpolicy. There are two reasons for that.   First, as I look around at the American scene I cannotbelieve that making gross national product grow faster, andmaking the consumption of ordinary Americans grow faster,which is where most of the GNP goes, is a very highobjective.   Between 1970 and 1988 real GNP increased by two-thirds andreal per-capita consumption increased by 45%. But theproportion of the population in poverty, by officialmeasures, did not decline. The underclass and the homelessare, if not more numerous, more intrusive in ourconsciousness and consciences. The quality of education is agreat concern. So are drugs and crime. Meanwhile we arefalling all over ourselves to cut the defense budget, on theground of economic necessity.   Second, if the great majority of the American people feelthat improving their living standards and those of theirchildren is a high-priority objective, they have the means todo much to achieve that objective without further involvementof the federal government. They can work harder, save moreand get their children to study more.   I do not agree with those who think that the governmentshould have no role in affecting economic growth. But theobjectives that people have less ability to achieve forthemselves deserve a higher priority in the government'sattention. This includes defense, helping to ensureinternational political stability, environmental protection,crime prevention, maintenance of equal treatment before thelaw, provision of infrastructure, and provision ofopportunity for the very poor to lift themselves out ofpoverty.   In my opinion, we are too rich to go on measuring ournational life in billions of dollars of GNP.
