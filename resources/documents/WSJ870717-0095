William Fisher, Chrysler Canada Ltd.'s vice president, personnel, made his comments after receiving the union's opening contract proposals. Contracts between the union and the Canadian units of Chrysler, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. expire Sept. 14. Talks with the Ford and GM units began earlier this week.    Canadian Auto Workers President Robert White said Mr. Fisher didn't present him with any specific proposals to alter classifications or work practices. The union represents about 9,600 workers at four plants, and an additional 400 office employees and 4,000 pensioners at Chrysler.    As with GM and Ford, the union made improved pensions its top priority at Chrysler. Mr. Fisher said fully indexed pensions would add about 3 Canadian dollars ($2.27) an hour to Chrysler's current hourly labor cost in Canada of more than 20 dollars.    Local negotiations between Chrysler and the union will continue until Aug. 10, when national talks are scheduled to resume. </TEXT></DOC>
