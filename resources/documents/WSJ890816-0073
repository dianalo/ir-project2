Charles Wilson is a macho, strutting Texan who admits to little sentiment. But these days, to hear him, he's worried about trees and birds and fauna with more than two legs.    The lanky Democrat is lined up against old friends in the lumber industry over the stark practice of clear-cutting forest lands in East Texas. &quot;I just don't think that clear-cutting is the way God meant it to be,&quot; he says.    Mr. Wilson isn't alone. From global warming to nuclear waste, the African elephant to the Florida sea turtle, the House Appropriations Committee on which he sits has added at least $1.6 billion to President Bush's fiscal 1990 budget this summer in the name of the environment.    The Senate will trim back a bit, but its timber and energy barons are already on notice. Logging interests suffered a rare defeat when senators cut forest-road funds last month in favor of wildlife and parks. Where the House added $6 million for an institute to study global change, the Senate added $30 million to finance Energy Department research in the same field.    Outside events -- like the Exxon Valdez oil spill -- play a part. But as seen with Mr. Wilson, the change under way is more than a single cause or political strategy imposed from atop. Like the appropriations process itself, amendments are driven by often-localized interests, and lawmakers vie to bring home parks or to clean up wastes much as they once competed for conventional public works.    &quot;Front page and front porch,&quot; says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman, push the issues forward. &quot;You have a process that drives it from the bottom up,&quot; says Edward Reilly, a strategist close to House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.). &quot;The niche that's available for Democrats is to begin fighting for communities.&quot;    Republicans are mindful of the same movement. &quot;There must be more government intervention,&quot; says GOP pollster Lance Tarrance. But after campaigning as a latter-day Teddy Roosevelt, Mr. Bush needs not only a big stick but deep pockets. Congress is poised to add a minimum of $280 million to his request for cleaning up nuclear-weapon plants, and the president is being outspent by as much as $225 million in traditional park and wildlife accounts. &quot;Our authority exceeds our resources,&quot; says Environmental Protection Agency Director William Reilly, whose total budget was increased $539 million by the House, including $20 million for Boston Harbor, where candidate Bush railed against pollution last year.    For House and Senate appropriators, changing priorities means adapting old methods to new ends. Traditional lines of jurisdiction blur as foreign-aid, space and military accounts are tapped for environmental projects. Funds are committed in a race not just to allocate resources but to gain power over federal policy in the future.    The House-backed National Institute on Global Environmental Change was fashioned with an eye for votes from appropriators who have a stake in positioning the Energy Department in front on issues like global warming. The University of California at Davis -- in the home district of the institute's chief sponsor, Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.) -- would manage the project. Regional partners include Harvard, Indiana and Tulane universities, with ties not only to Rep. John Myers (R., Ind.) and Rep. Lindy Boggs (D., La.) on the House energy subcommittee but also to Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.), who heads the corresponding Senate panel on energy appropriations.    The pressure for parks and land pushes up spending in the annual Interior Department bill -- dubbed &quot;Little Pork&quot; -- even as funding for water projects -- &quot;Big Pork&quot; -- has fallen. House appropriations for construction and land accounts in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service add up to a pool of more than $350 million in discretionary funds -- virtually all earmarked by members like Mr. Wilson, who set aside $2.9 million for visitor facilities at the Big Thicket preserve in his district.    Land also helps to forge alliances between environmentalists, who are more often on the left, and hunters and other sportsmen, with ties to the conservative gun lobby. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, are such a case. Mr. Dingell is more visible as a friend of the auto industry and National Rifle Association. But he also serves on a migratory-bird commission with Mr. Conte, who co-sponsored with him this year a spending amendment jealously protective of stamp revenue used to support preserves for ducks.    The same mix of interests was seen during Senate debate last month on roadconstruction funds for the Forest Service. The turning point was a narrow 52-47 roll call in which Southern Democrats behind Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.) provided the margin to reduce such spending, the reverse of the outcome on a similar vote in 1986. Environmentalists took advantage of regional divisions in the timber industry but also reached out to sportsmen by promising to reallocate at least $9 million to accounts funding improvements for waterfowl habitat and to restore wetlands.    The environmental pressures accent the changing values in the Western U.S. A little-noticed provision in a Senate-passed spending bill directs the government to pay $15 million to take over more than 56,000 acres used by an irrigation project in Utah, but to which the government already has formal title. The payment is to compensate an influential set of Utah landowners and water users for contractual rights given them decades ago by the Bureau of Reclamation, but to some the price appears dictated foremost by a political settlement blessed by the state's senior Republican, Sen. Jake Garn.    Mr. Garn, who attached the amendment as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, says he acted without favoritism to resolve a longstanding dispute over the fate of the property. Critics, including some fellow Republicans, argue that the senator is overly indulging the older, entrenched landowners and has grown isolated from a West where the grass-roots sentiment favors sportsmen and environmentalists fearful of limited environmental funds being squandered.    Bureau of Reclamation estimates of the compensation due the owners have run at less than half the legislated price. And even as Sen. Garn presses ahead, the General Accounting Office is reviewing the case at the request of Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), chairman of an authorizing subcommittee overseeing the Bureau of Reclamation.    Joseph Novak, an attorney for the sellers, the Strawberry Water Users Association, acknowledges that their own paid appraisal put the net value of the property at only $11.5 million. But he said more was needed to help meet large federal taxes due on the transaction and still leave money to make improvements in the irrigation project. &quot;I don't care what the GAO says,&quot; scoffs Sen. Garn. &quot;Sometimes the government pays for nothing, for intangibles.&quot;    ---@ Major House Increases To Bush Environmental Budget @ (In millions of dollars) @ Environmental Protection Agency +$539 @ Nuclear weapons plant waste cleanup + 335 @ Military bases cleanup + 383 @ National Park Service + 168 @ Fish and Wildlife Service + 71 @ Other major wildlife habitat + 103 </TEXT></DOC>
