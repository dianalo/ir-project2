The sorbent entrained in the flue gas removes SO/sub 2/ in thehumdification zone. It also removes SO/sub 2/ in the particulate layercollected the the ESP or baghouse. Field and pilot plant tests of theprocess have shown that the process can provide up to 85% SO/sub 2/ removalat once-through sorbent utilizations of 20 to 40%. At the observed sorbentutilizations, the fresh sorbent cost comprises 50% or more of the processSO/sub 2/ controls. Consequently, an improvement in the sorbent utilizationis extremely beneficial from an economic standpoint. Of the unused Ca(OH)/sub2/ in the spent sorbent has a high SO/sub 2/ removal efficiency, sorbentrecycle would be a simple means to increase sorbent utilization. A portionof the waste solids removed from the particulate collection system isreinjected along with fresh lime upstream of the humidification zone.This paper presents recycle tests results from Consol's 0.1 MWe Coolsidepilot test unit. These tests were made using composites of spent sorbentsfrom earlier pilot tests. The SO/sub 2/ removal performance was evaluatedfrom recycle sorbents with and without simultaneous fresh sorbent feed.The test with simultaneous fresh and recycle sorbent feeds simulatedthe Coolside process with sorbent recycle. The results show that, onan equivalent available calcium basis, the recycle sorbent was nearlyas effective as fresh sorbent for SO/sub 2/ capture. Sorbent utilizationincreased to about 50% as a result of the sorbent recycle.</TEXT></DOC>
