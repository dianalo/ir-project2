At Beijing University, the country's most prestigious, studentsfor the first time produced an independent newspaper.   The class boycott today brought into a new phase pro-democracyprotests that were sparked by the April 15 death of oustedCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a popular reformer.   Posters calling on students to strike, satirical cartoons ofgovernment leaders, and essays decrying official corruption coveredthe walls of many universities throughout Beijing.   Student leaders said they planned to strike until the governmentagrees to opens talks and that they believed students in othercities were ready to join the boycott.   ``Premier Li Peng, step down now,'' read one poster at BeijingNormal University. ``Deng Xiaoping, your time has come,'' readanother in a reference to widespread student belief that the84-year-old senior leader is too old to run the country.   On Friday and Saturday, about 150,000 students and supportersspent the night at Tiananmen Square, defying a government order toclear the vast expanse. The demonstration _ one of the biggestsince the 1949 Communist victory _ was the students' clearestchallenge yet to the ruling monopoly.   Students who gathered Saturday on the square to mourn Hu shouted``Down with dictatorship'' as senior officials arrived for anofficial memorial service at the adjacent Great Hall of the People.   Protests also occurred in other cities. In Xian and Changsha,bands of young toughs entered student ranks, burning cars andbuildings, looting stores and beating policemen. Foreign sources inChangsha said the looting continued there for a second nightSunday, but on a smaller scale.   Smaller protests in Shanghai, Chengdu, Canton and Tianjin werepeaceful.   At Beijing University today, about 5,000 students, one-third ofthe student body, flocked to the athletic field for a meeting ofthe newly formed student union.   ``We come here together for a common purpose: democracy andscience,'' a student leader told the crowd. ``Seventy years afterour first student movement, China is still poor and behind the restof the world.''   About 1,500 students gathered at Qinghua University, wheregraduate students draped pro-democracy posters from every balconyand window.   About 1,000 students from the Beijing Foreign Languages Collegeleft their campus and marched from school to school to encouragecolleagues.   One strike leader at Beijing University said all 15,000 studentswere on strike. Leaders at several other schools, with a combinedenrollment of 20,000, said their classmates also were boycottingclass.   At Beijing Normal University students marched through the campusbanging drums and gongs and yelling in unison: ``Boycott class,boycott class.'' Several groups entered buildings, occupyingclassrooms.   One poster at Beijing University pleaded with teachers to``please understand and support our strike. I love my teachers butI love the truth more.'' Another addressed China's parliament,appealing for government tolerance. It was signed by 143 teachers.   The first issue of the student-run newspaper provided a detailedaccount of what the students said were police beatings last week.Previously, students were not allowed to print their own papers.   Copies were plastered on trees, utility poles, in bathrooms andon walls throughout the campus.   The students have also presented to the state a list of demandsincluding freedom of the press, a crackdown on rampant corruptionand the publication of financial records of China's leaders.   ``If we act boldly, we will become the heroes of China. If welose our nerve, we will have the guilt of history on ourshoulders,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, a student leader at Beijing NormalUniversity.   He said the main goal of the movement right now was to expandthe strike to other cities: ``The government is still ignoring us.Our only hope is to make this movement nationwide.''   Outside the campus, students set out collection boxes and handedout leaflets. At one corner near the school, students said they hadreceived more than 2,000 yuan ($540) in two hours.   Other groups made speeches at major intersections, stoppingtraffic at some points. ``Workers, listen to us,'' one student tolda crowd of 500 in central Beijing. ``We are fighting for the rightsof all Chinese.''   At a meeting Sunday night, students decided on a slogan for themovement: Democracy, Science, Freedom, Human Rights and Law.   The catchphrase is based on China's greatest democraticmovement, the May 4th movement of 1919, which celebrates its 70thanniversary a week from Thursday. Students say they expect thestrike to continue at least until then.   The protests occur as China faces serious economic problems suchas record-high inflation and ingrained corruption in the CommunistParty.   A recent meeting of the national legislature ended by brakingfurther an ambitious reform program started in 1979 to open China'sstate-run economy to market forces. Students say they oppose theretrenchment.</TEXT></DOC>
