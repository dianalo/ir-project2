 For Witenstein, Clipper is the strongest alternative.andM;&quot;Clipper allows us to develop an application in about a fourth of the time itwould take in C, COBOL or BASIC,&quot; he said.andM;Witensten also cited Clipper 5.0's flexibility and extensive features.andP;  &quot;Thelanguage is so expansive, we can make it do just about anything,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The new Get object allows the programmer to have full control over the Getstack.&quot;andM;Other buyers of Clipper 5.0 agree that it is notably more flexible than otherdBASE products.andM;&quot;If a feature is not there, Clipper's architecture allows you to write ityourself--it's not just a strict set of functions or commands,&quot; said JackEvans, owner of Success Logic, a consulting firm in San Clemente, Calif.andM;Evans is using Clipper 5.0 to develop applications ranging from financialapplications to office-automation software.andM;Flexibility was also a priority for buyers of Sophco Inc.'s Force.andP;  &quot;Force isso extendable.andP;  The fact the it's designed on a C compiler allows you to dowhatever you want with it,&quot; said Vic Williams, president of WoodswiseConsulting Onc., a consulting firm in Burnaby, British Columbia.andM;However, one thing Williams noted that was lacking in Force was run-timeinterpreter.andP;  &quot;If you change the length of the DBF file, it violates whatForce knows, and you get a run-time error,&quot; he said.andM;For Success Logic's Evans, a major factor in picking Clipper over otheralternatives was its superior support of multiuser environments.andM;Compatibility across multiuser platforms was also a critical feature forbuyers of Wordtech Systems Inc.'s Quicksilver.andM;&quot;We're running Quicksilver on an IBM Token-Ring LAN, and it performs verywell&quot;, said Kevin Block, a systems analyst at Chevron Information TechnologyCo. in San Ramone, Calif.andP;  &quot;We could easily grow 200 to 300 percent and nothave to think of performance concerns.&quot;andM;One drawback Block noted with Quick-silver is its lack of extended-memorysupport.andP;  &quot;The executables are so large, there's not much you can do at 640KRAM,&quot; he said.andM;Buyers of Ashton-Tate's dBASE IV Developer's Edition said they value theproduct's ability to catch errors before the compile process is completed.andM;Richard Brenner, president of Westar Systems, a software development house inColorado Springs, Colo., uses dBASE IV Developer's Edition for creatingapplications for non-profit fund-rasing management and visual-informationmanagement.andM;&quot;In the compiling process, dBASE IV is very effective in identifyingpotential logic failures, and shows them to me when I'm compiling.&quot;andP;  Brennernoted that this feature didn't exist in the previous version of dBASE.andM;Keith Mitchell, vice president of operations at Solon Consulting Group Ltd.,andO;a consulting firm in Silver Spring, Md., uses dBASE IV Developer's Edition tocreate single and multiuser data-entry analysis systems.andP;  Mitchell isimpressed with the template language of the compiler.andM;&quot;You have the ability to create your own custom code generator by directmodification of the templates,&quot; said Mitchell.andP;  &quot;This, combined with the[user-defined functions] puts you in a situation where, if you're asophisticated user, you can change the way dBASE acts.andP;  It becomes more of aC programming language.&quot;andM;Scott Robertson, president of Champion Business Systems, a microcomputeraccounting software firm in Denver, was also impressed with dBASE IV'stemplate features.andM;&quot;dBASE is much faster [than other development languages] because the templatefeatures do half the work for you,&quot; he said.andM;One thing both Robertson and Mitchell noted that dBASE was lacking was a fullprofessional compiler.andM;Technical support is also a concern of many dBASE users.andP;  Don Smith,purchasing manager at the Nashua, N.H., branch of Ingersoll-Rand Co., amanufacturing firm, was notably impressed with Fox Software's technicalsupport.andM;Smith, who is currently using FoxPro to develop both customer database and asupplier database, said that the speed and ability to perform sophisticatedsorting of information is a critical feature of FoxPro.andM;&quot;The amount of information I was able to put in and then perform adescriptive sort, you couldn't do with anything else,&quot; said Smith.andP;  &quot;It cansort a 198,000-part record in less than 20 minutes.&quot;andM;Smith also noted that the user interface of FoxPro is a valuable feature foranyone who is not familiar with programming.andM;&quot;I have found that dealing with people that are not computer literate, beingable to look at a box on the screen with questions defined in it makes allthe difference in the world,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;You tend to get a lot more productivity from someone who thinks they have ahandle on it,&quot; Smith added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
