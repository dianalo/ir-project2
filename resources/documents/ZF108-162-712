SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA,1990 FEB 7 (NB) -- Aldus was unable to talk about the PC version of Pagemaker4.0 when it announced the Mac version, and they put the blame squarely onBill Gates and Microsoft.andM;When the press conference was over, and the press had asked about a PCversion for probably the 80th time, Aldus screened a short video-clipproduced by Microsoft.andP;  It showed an open window (2.0 in fact) through whichthe camera zoomed, then on the horizon loomed a closed window--all we couldsee through this window was Bill Gates, Microsoft head, wagging his finger asif to say &quot;we'll tell you when you're ready for Windows 3, so don't botherknocking!&quot;andM;Aldus has promised second quarter shipping as in &quot;by June 30&quot; for the Macversion but indications are that they're actually aiming for April.andP;  &quot;We hadplanned on a PC launch first,&quot; said Pacific Rim Marketing Manager RogerGulrajani, at the Sydney announcement, held concurrently with the US event.andO;The implication, clearly given by various Aldus and Microsoft people, wasthat there is some greater plan, and until Microsoft ships Windows 3, noproducts that require it will be announced.andP;  Industry paranoid-schizophrenicswent as far as to suggest some pressure on Microsoft from IBM may beaffecting the date.andM;(Paul Zucker/19900207)</TEXT></DOC>
