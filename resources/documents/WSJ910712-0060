Although mostinvestment professionals had expected the reappointment,there was some nervousness as Mr. Bush continued to delay adecision with the August expiration of Mr. Greenspan'scurrent term approaching.   In remarks to a congressional committee yesterday, Mr.Greenspan said the Fed recognizes that the U.S. economy islaboring under the pressures of a credit crunch and he saidthe Fed is spending an &quot;inordinate&quot; amount of time &quot;trying tounwind the problem.&quot;   Bond prices rose steadily on the assumption that while theFed struggles short-term to solve the credit crunch, it willremain committed in the long-term to fighting inflation. Someanalysts suggested that in the absence of any unexpectedsurge in inflation, bond prices may be beginning a long-termrally.   &quot;I have to think this rally in the bond market goes beyondthe mere reappointment of Alan Greenspan,&quot; said Ralph Bloch,a market analyst at Raymond, James andamp; Associates. And he saidthe rally in the stock market may signal that prices there,too, are headed higher.   Mr. Bloch said the stock market has been locked in aparticularly narrow trading range for the past few weeks thatis marked by a pattern in which prices reverse themselvesduring the course of the trading day, with a sharp rally inthe morning fading away in late trading. But he saidyesterday's gains in the closing minutes of trading havebroken the pattern and may be providing an indication of themarket's direction. &quot;That suggests to me that the odds aregrowing that we'll make new highs,&quot; he said.   The dollar rallied sharply against the mark afterGermany's Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged. Currencytraders had worried that the German central bank might nudgeshort-term rates higher in an effort to put a cap on risinginflation. Higher interest rates tend to make a currency moreattractive to investors.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices rose in active trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 157.7 million shares. Advancingissues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 862 to 638.                                                                                                          Bond prices gained. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondrose half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Theyield on the issue slipped to 8.46%.                                                                                                          The dollar rallied.
