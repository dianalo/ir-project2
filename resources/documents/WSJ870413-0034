Gillett Jr. has done everything from running sports teams to management consulting to buying a meatpacker. Now he wants to be a television mogul.    Last week, Mr. Gillett, chairman of Nashville, Tenn.-based Gillett Holdings Inc., acknowledged he is negotiating to buy slightly more than a half interest in six TV stations controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. for more than $600 million.    If he reaches a definitive agreement with the New York investment firm, Mr. Gillett, 48 years old, would control affiliate stations reaching more than 13% of the nation's 87.4 million homes with TV sets. That would make him the largest independent operator of network affiliate stations -- only the three major networks each control station groups reaching more people, while Westinghouse Electric Corp. owns five network affiliates reaching about 10% of TV homes.    But Mr. Gillett's station-buying spree, which started last year, also stands to make him one of the broadcasting industry's biggest debtors. He has been paying top dollar for stations, mainly with high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds and other financing raised by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which probably will handle his latest proposed purchase. Since July, he has bought or agreed to purchase six other stations, mainly affiliates, for a total of more than $650 million.    The purchases are a gamble because Mr. Gillett and his closely held Gillett Holdings are taking on debt in the midst of a soft national advertising environment. But Mr. Gillett is betting on aggressive market research, cost control and a modest resurgence in inflation and advertising spending to bolster revenue and cash flow at the stations.    &quot;Maybe we see or feel something that others don't see or feel,&quot; says Mr. Gillett, who once applied for admission to Harvard Business School but was dissuaded by school officials, who urged him to go directly into management consulting instead. &quot;In a modest inflationary environment,&quot; when it is easier for stations to boost advertising rates, &quot;television historically has been a great business to be in.&quot;    Mr. Gillett is no stranger to broadcasting. One company he headed purchased radio stations beginning in 1969, and he moved into TV in 1978 with the acquisition of three small network affiliates. But backed by Drexel Burnham, which raised $485 million for him last year for station acquisitions and for refinancing existing debt, he has become one of the industry's most aggressive buyers.    Among other moves, he acquired stations in Baltimore and Richmond, Va., last year for $207 million from A.S. Abell Co. when Abell was bought by Times Mirror Co.; purchased three stations from John Blair andamp; Co., a Reliance Capital Group Inc. unit, for $86 million; and last month agreed to buy with a partner a Tampa, Fla., station from Oklahoma Publishing Co. for about $365 million.    Mr. Gillett's rise to prominence in the broadcasting industry follows an eclectic career. He has worked for Crown Zellerbach Corp. as a salesman, formed a computer software company, acted as a management consultant for McKinsey andamp; Co., served as business manager and part owner of the Miami Dolphins, and owned and ran the Harlem Globetrotters with two partners for about a decade.    Mr. Gillett struck out on his own in 1978, when he acquired a profitable meatpacker, Green Bay, Wis.-based Packerland Packing Co., for more than $13 million. Packerland remains the largest operation of Gillett Holdings, which had operating profit last year of $59.6 million on sales of $686.4 million, according to documents supplied to prospective junk-bond purchasers. In 1985, the company's operating profit was $25.3 million on sales of $590.9 million.    Mr. Gillett, an avid golfer and skier, also owns Vail Associates, which operates ski resorts in Vail and Beaver Creek, Colo. He bought the resorts in 1985 for about $55 million and the assumption of $70 million of debt.    Mr. Gillett said he began buying TV stations because they fit his acquisition criteria: He favors businesses that are non-capital intensive, non-labor intensive, have inherent franchises, are highly promotable and highly liquid.    Mr. Gillett typically boosts cash flow at his stations by controlling costs and improving stations' ratings in local news and adjacent time periods -- the most important advertising slots for affiliated TV stations. To find out what viewers want from their local station, his market researchers usually conduct individual interviews with hundreds of local viewers and add to the research with so-called focus group sessions with viewers.    &quot;Certain markets are deeply concerned with health issues,&quot; for example, he said. &quot;Weather may be bigger in other markets, while family issues may be more important&quot; somewhere else. The formula appears to have worked -- most of Mr. Gillett's stations are first in their markets, according to TV ratings concerns.    The six stations for which he is currently negotiating are operated by SCI Holdings Inc., parent of Storer Communications Inc., which was taken private in 1985 in a $2.5 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis. Under the proposed transaction, SCI would transfer the stations to a new company that would be jointly owned by SCI and Mr. Gillett, who would have the right to buy out Kohlberg Kravis's interest if the investment firm decided to sell it later.    Gillett Holdings currently owns or has agreements to buy 14 other stations and will have to sell some of them under federal rules that limit a company's ownership to 12 TV stations.
