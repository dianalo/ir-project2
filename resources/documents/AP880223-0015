WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They call it Super Tuesday. A better name might beTarmac Tuesday. Or maybe Satellite Tuesday.   The Tuesday comes in two weeks, on March 8. What's super aboutit is that the day will be the closest America has ever come toholding a national primary election to select presidential nominees.   Democratic and Republican nominees may not be decided then, butthe presidential landscape will be altered.   Twenty of the 50 states hold primaries or caucuses, and they arescattered from Massachusetts to Florida to Idaho. Yet Tuesday has adistinctly Southern flavor. Fourteen of those 20 states are in theSouth or border regions. Every state of the South save SouthCarolina holds delegate contests that day _ and the Republicans inSouth Carolina hold theirs three days earlier.   To campaign across that vast expanse of country, thepresidential candidates have found agreement. The only way reallyis for the candidate to wing his way to as many cities as possibleeach day in an effort to get his face, and maybe even a few of hiswords, on the local television news.   No candidate, they reason, can buy enough television commercialsto carry 20 states in a two- to three-week campaign, although somewill try. So they aim for the ``free'' TV time.   Hence Tarmac Tuesday. Many of the candidates are seeing no moreof the states or cities where they campaign than can be viewed fromthe airports where they hold news conferences, or more often thecase, from the single event they hold not far from the airport.   Then it's quickly off to the next event in the next ``mediamarket.'' They are ``press hits'' in the jargon of this campaign.   ``Look for a lot of hits that are close to the airports,'' saidEd Reilly, a polltaker and strategist for one of the Democrats,Richard Gephardt. ``You look for your opportunities within 20minutes from the airports, so you can get back and on to the nextone.''   Quick campaign stops are nothing new to presidential campaigns.But it's hardly what the architects of the Southern regionalprimary had in mind.   They wanted to take some of the thunder away from Iowa and NewHampshire. For all the criticism of those two early states,candidates do spend a lot of time there and really do meet withreal voters.   The way it worked out, those states may have gotten even moreattention this time, while the South is still waiting to hear aboutits concerns of, say, rural poverty and development.   But still a better name for this mega-primary, Reilly says, maybe Satellite Tuesday.   Developments in television technology have played directly tothe candidates' slavish need to get television airtime. Local TVstations now have _ and use _ the technology to get live reportsfrom from virtually anywhere.   The candidates are trying to exploit that by accommodatingtelevision stations in the Super Tuesday states, not just bytailoring local events but by making far-flung campaign appearancesavailable via satellite to stations elsewhere.   Campaigns may pay to have video pictures of their candidate atan apperance beamed up to a satellite where it is available forstations that want it, even if they didn't have crews on the scene.   ``We have found in these small markets, particularly withagriculture stories, we've had enormous success'' getting thecandidate on the air, Reilly said.   Hence Gephardt makes three stops as he flies across three timezones one day last week. And he walks through a nearly idleelectronics factory, to underscore his attack on unfair tradepractices, with only a half-dozen people to hear him talk.   It was the handful of television cameras there that he had inmind.   Never mind that the factory was in Rapid City, S.D. It's one ofthe five states with primaries or caucuses in the three weeksbefore Super Tuesday, but it is a state where the primary ismeaningless in the allocation of delegates. That will come later atthe state caucus.   What counted was that the Gephardt story that day appeared notonly on South Dakota television, but on some Southern stations too.It is the old story of television creating a ``global village.''   And it means that the campaigns pick events and locations thatmeld with the point a candidate is trying to make. His message forthe day will be summed up in a 30 second bite on television thatevening, if he's lucky. So look for Gephardt to go to a Texasautomobile factory and a Birmingham, Ala., steel mill to make hispoint about foreign competition and lost jobs.   ``It's Super-Satellite Tuesday,'' Reilly said. ``Pretty soon theSecret Service will have to start attaching those (satellite)dishes to the limos so these guys can do link-ups from the road.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: William M.
