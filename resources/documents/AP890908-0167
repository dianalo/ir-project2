All nine judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals this week rejected arequest by independent counsel James McKay for a rehearing of theJune 27 decision that set aside Nofziger's convictions for illegallobbying.   Independent counsel James McKay said in a brief interview thathis office's ``present inclination'' is to ask the Supreme Court totake the case.   In its 2-1 opinion overturning Nofziger's conviction, the courthad said that for Nofziger to be found guilty of illegal lobbying,prosecutors were required to prove he had known that what he wasdoing was illegal.   ``I think that the majority opinion in this case is clearlywrong,'' appeals court judge Harry Edwards said in a statementTuesday with which three of his colleagues concurred.   Edwards said, however, that the full appeals court wasn't theproper place to hear the matter and that ``any further considerationof this case must be'' by the Supreme Court. Concurring with Edwardswere Chief Judge Patricia Wald, Abner Mikva and Ruth B. Ginsburg.All four judges are Carter administration appointees.   The other five judges currently on the appeals court are LaurenceSilberman, James Buckley, Stephen Williams, Douglas Ginsburg andDavid Sentelle. All are Reagan administration appointees.   Edwards was the dissenting vote in the June 27 decision and saidat that time that his colleagues had twisted the meaning of theEthics in Government Act under which Nofziger was convicted.   Nofziger was convicted on Feb. 11, 1988, of illegally lobbyingthe White House on behalf of scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., amaritime workers union and Fairchild Corp. He lobbied for an Armyengine contract for Wedtech, for the placement of civilian sailorson Navy vessels and for continued Air Force buying of an anti-tankaircraft made by Fairchild.</TEXT></DOC>
