Leaders of the country's political parties, to whom the rebelFarabundo Marti Liberation Front made the offer on Tuesday, said itseemed to reflect a sincere guerrilla desire for peace.   They said in a resolution that they would today meet withPresident Jose Napoleon Duarte and ask him to immediately engage therebels in talks.   The rebel and political leaders had met for two days _ the firstsuch meeting of its kind _ in an effort to end a nine-year civil warthat has claimed 70,000 lives, most of them civilian.   Representatives of the 13 parties agreed late Tuesday to presstheir U.S.-backed government to discuss the new rebel offer directlywith its authors, who were for the first time offering to lay downtheir arms.   ``We are going to press right away for a meeting with theexecutive branch and legislative branch, '' said Francisco Merino,vice presidential candidate for the rightist Republican NationalistAlliance, or Arena.   Arena has been leading in the presidential polls and, along withDuarte and the military, has opposed any arrangement that wouldpostpone the vote.   In El Salvador on Monday, guerrillas attacked the country'sprincipal army base and an engineering detachment, leaving eightdead and 17 injured.   ``Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not onlycontinue, but will escalate,'' rebel radio declared.   Guerrilla leaders were clearly pleased with the outcome of themeeting. Their last talks with the government fell apart after themurder of human rights leader Herbert Anaya Sanabria in October 1987.   ``The parties have opened the possibility of a nationalconsensus,'' rebel commander Schafik Jorge Handal told a newsconference after the meeting at a resort complex in this town 40miles south of Mexico City.   The rebels are calling for an agreement with the government on acease-fire, electoral reforms and postponing the March 19 vote atleast four months to give them a chance to enter the politicalprocess peacefully.   They are also calling for cutting the Armed Forces from 56,000members to 12,000, and for consolidating the National Police, theNational Guard and Treasury Police under civilian authority.   In return, the guerrillas offer to lay down their arms and endtheir decade-long election boycott.   ``The proposal of the FMLN is very clear: they're searching forpeace,'' said Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes, presidential candidate ofthe centrist Authentic Christian Movement. ``This is the first timethat such a thing has happened.'' The catalyst for the Oaxtepecgathering was a January 23 rebel proposal to take part in theelections and respect their outcome if the voting were postponed bysix months.   Duarte, the military and Arena, which recently wrested control ofthe National Assembly from the president's Christian Democrats, havescorned the January proposal.   Now, however, Arena is party to Tuesday's agreement to considerthe expanded peace plan and Duarte must confront the public pressureof his country's most powerful political party.   ``I would say in general that the government has to talk now,that they cannot refuse or evade talks with the FMLN,'' said RubenZamora, head of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of smallleftist parties.   Duarte, who is suffering from terminal cancer, will also bepressured to reign in a battle-hardened military with a long historyof human rights abuses.   Last week, Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said ifthe elections were postponed and Duarte stayed in power past June 1,when his constitutional term ends, the army might intervene.</TEXT></DOC>
