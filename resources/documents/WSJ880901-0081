In an interview, Mr. LaWare, a former Boston banker who was sworn in Aug. 15, indicated he comes to the job with some well-thought-out views on monetary policy. And those views seem to place him squarely in the camp of the district Fed presidents who have been leading the drive recently for a tighter Fed policy.    Mr. LaWare pointed out, for instance, that the nation's factory operating rate is now at 83.5%, and he said, &quot;We can't go much beyond that without getting real pressures on prices and wages.&quot; He also said the 3.3% growth rate in the second quarter of this year &quot;has all the earmarks of something that has inflationary pressures built in.&quot; And he criticized people who apply &quot;the term 'lackluster' to an economy growing at a 2 1/2%&quot; pace.    Fed policy makers have been sharply divided in recent months. Those leading the push for a tighter policy, including many of the 12 district Fed presidents, have worried that rapid economic growth will lead to rising inflation. Those resisting a tighter policy, including a majority of the seven Fed governors here, prefer not to target economic growth, but rather take their cues from the financial markets. A rising dollar, stable commodity prices and relatively stable bond prices have suggested to them that inflation fears may be overblown.    It isn't clear whether Mr. LaWare helped tip the scales at the Aug. 16 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy making panel, because the most recent vote on monetary policy hasn't been made public.    Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who like many of the district presidents focuses on indicators of economic activity, has worked hard to reconcile the two camps. Recently, he was able to persuade all the other Fed governors to support an increase in the bellwether discount interest rate -- a policy change pushed by the district presidents. Nevertheless, the deep philosophical split continues to pose a problem for the central bank.    Mr. LaWare said he looks at both data on the economy and data on financial markets in forming his views about inflation. But his comments suggest he puts more weight on the economic data. He suggested, for instance, that &quot;the unemployment number this Friday is a good one to watch.&quot;    Mr. LaWare, former chairman of Shawmut National Corp., is expected to concentrate on banking regulatory issues while at the Fed, and he is a strong proponent of deregulation. His term as governor expires in 2002. The seat was previously held by Henry Wallich, who retired for health reasons in December 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
