A rumor early in the session of Israeli military action againstLibya sparked a rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   As the buying waned after the rumor was dispelled, fresh news ofOPEC efforts to prop up world oil prices renewed the rally.   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 47 cents to $17.15 a42-gallon barrel, more than making up for Wednesday's 46-cent loss.Contracts for later delivery advanced by similar amounts.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, theJuly contract of wholesale unleaded gasoline surged 1.44 cents to60.93 cents a gallon after dropping 1.83 cents on Wednesday. Laterdelivery contracts posted more moderate gains.   The July home heating oil contract added 1.10 cents, settling at49.03 cents a gallon following Wednesday's slide of 0.56 cent.Subsequent contracts also rose.   In natural gas trading, the August contract rose to $1.515 per1,000 cubic feet from $1.500 Wednesday. The Wednesday settlementwas the lowest for the near-month contract since the New York Mercbegan trading natural gas in early April. Contracts for laterdelivery were mixed.   James Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc., said tradingstarted out with a bang as a rumor that Israel had bombed Tripolicirculated in the market. Within an hour, an Israeli governmentspokesman had denied the rumor and buying interest began to fade.   But news that the acting president of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries has scheduled further strategysessions with several cartel members pumped new life into therally. The cartel leader has had a series of meetings to discussways to shore up the slumping market.   Energy analysts said the rally caught some traders off guard.Many of them have been shorting the market, or selling contracts inanticipation of further price declines.
