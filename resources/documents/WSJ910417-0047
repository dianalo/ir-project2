Mr.Auletta was not the first to use the term, but he was largelyresponsible for making it part of middle-class America'sworking vocabulary.   Since the term &quot;underclass&quot; is relatively new, most peopleassume that the phenomenon it describes must also be new. Yetwhat we now call the underclass bears a striking resemblanceto what sociologists used to call the lower class. Both arecharacterized by high levels of joblessness, illiteracy,illegitimacy, violence and despair. Ethnographic accounts oflower-class life in the 1960s describe lives that seem verysimilar in all these respects to the lives described in morerecent writing on the underclass.</LP><TEXT>   If the American class structure is changing, the change isnot that a completely new class has come into existence butthat the old lower class has grown larger and perhaps moreisolated from mainstream society. In my judgment thesechanges are not large enough to justify substituting the termunderclass for the term lower class.   Americans started talking about the underclass during the1980s because they sensed that their society was becomingmore unequal. The rich were getting richer, but the poor wereas numerous as ever. At the same time, the fabric oflower-class life seemed to be unraveling. Poor parents wereless likely to marry, and millions of single mothers weretrying to live on welfare checks that paid less per monththan the rich spent every day amusing themselves. Crime wasrampant in many poor neighborhoods. Inner-city schools seemedunable to teach most of their students basic skills. As aresult, poor children no longer seemed to have much chance ofescaping from poverty, as earlier generations had.   If all these problems had arisen more or lesssimultaneously, the idea that shrinking economicopportunities were creating a new underclass would be hard toresist. In reality, however, while economic conditions beganto deteriorate for less-skilled workers in the 1970s, most ofthe other problems that led Americans to start talking aboutan underclass followed different trajectories. Some had beengetting worse for a long time. Some had gotten worse between1965 and 1975 but then leveled off. Some have actually gottenbetter. When we try to link changes in family structure,welfare use, school enrollment, academic achievement orcriminal violence to changes in economic opportunity, theconnections prove elusive. To see why, it is helpful tocompare the timing of changes in different areas.                                                                                                          Which problems have gotten steadily worse?   -- Male joblessness. Long-term joblessness is somewhatsensitive to the business cycle, but the underlying rateamong men 25 to 54 years old rose in both the 1970s and1980s. Among whites the new jobless were seldom poor. Amongblacks, however, the kinds of poor men who had workedepisodically in 1960 often withdrew from the labor force,increasing the proportion of all blacks who were bothlong-term jobless and poor.   -- Unwed parenthood. The number of babies born tounmarried women did not rise much from 1960 to 1975, but thenumber of babies born to married women fell a lot, so theproportion of babies born out of wedlock rose. After 1975 thenumber of babies born to unmarried women also began to rise,though not dramatically. Since divorce has also become morecommon, the fraction of women raising children without malehelp has increased steadily. According to the Census Bureau,the share of American families with children headed by womenrose to 21.2% in 1988 from 18.6% in 1980 and 9.4% in 1960.                                                                                                          Which problems have stopped getting worse?   -- Welfare. While single motherhood increased steadilyafter 1960, the proportion of single mothers collectingwelfare rose only from 1964 to 1974. After that, it began todecline again. As a result, the proportion of all motherscollecting welfare rose dramatically between 1964 and 1974but then leveled off. As to the question of race, blacksactually constitute a declining fraction of all welfarerecipients -- 40% in 1987 vs. 45% in 1969.   -- Violence. Violent crime doubled between 1964 and 1974,remained roughly constant during the late 1970s, declinedsignificantly in the early 1980s, and edged up in the late1980s. As a result, violence was somewhat less common in thelate 1980s than in 1980 or 1970. This was especially trueamong blacks.                                                                                                          Which problems have gotten steadily better?   -- Dropouts. Both non-Hispanic whites and blacks were morelikely to earn a high school diploma or a high schoolequivalency certificate in the late 1980s than at any time inthe past. The disparity between blacks and whites was alsosmaller. Improvements on these indexes were, however,somewhat slower in the 1980s than in the 1960s or 1970s.   -- Reading and math skills. The proportion of 17-year-oldswith basic reading skills rose steadily during the 1970s and1980s, especially among blacks. The increase among whites wasmuch smaller. Disparities between the best and worst readers,while still huge, diminished significantly. The proportion of17-year-old blacks with basic math skills also rose duringthe 1980s.   -- Intergenerational inheritance. Among blacks,educational attainment became less dependent on familybackground between 1940 and 1980. As a result, black childrenfrom disadvantaged backgrounds had better educationalprospects in the 1980s than in 1970. Among whites, there waslittle change after 1970.                                                                                                          Which problems have stopped getting better?   -- Teen-age parenthood. Teen-age motherhood declinedduring the 1960s and 1970s. There was no clear trend duringthe 1980s. Teen-age fatherhood rose during the 1960s,declined during the 1970s, and was roughly constant duringthe 1980s.   -- Poverty. The proportion of individuals with familyincomes below the poverty line, which had fallen steadilyfrom 1940 to 1970, has not changed much since 1970. As theCensus Bureau has found, blacks constituted 31% of the poorin 1967, and they still constituted 31% of the poor in 1988.But the character of poverty has changed. It has become lesscommon among the elderly and more common among children.Poverty has also become more concentrated among families inwhich the head does not work regularly.                                                                                                          Which problems have I ignored?   -- Drugs. Drug use is a persistent problem. But I have notbeen able to find any convincing quantitative evidence aboutchanges in the prevalence or severity of the problem. Surveysof high school students show dramatic declines in almost allforms of drug use during the 1980s. Yet people who spend timein poor communities are convinced drugs became a more seriousproblem in the 1980s. Both claims are probably correct.   The trends I have described do not fit together in anysimple or obvious way. Those who think that everything hasgotten worse for people at the bottom of the social pyramidsince 1970 are clearly wrong. As far as I can see, the claimthat America has a growing underclass does not help us tounderstand complex changes of the kind I have described. Onthe contrary, arguments that use class as their centralexplanatory idea obscure what is going on.   Class labels provide a shorthand device for describingpeople who differ along many dimensions simultaneously. Theterm &quot;underclass&quot; conjures up a chronically jobless highschool dropout who has had two or three children out ofwedlock, has very little money to support them, and probablyhas either a criminal record or a history of welfaredependence. But relatively few people fit such stereotypesperfectly. We use class labels precisely because we want tomake the world seem tidier than it is.   The illusion of class homogeneity does no harm in somecontexts, but it encourages two kinds of logical error whenwe try to describe social change. Whenever we observe anincrease in behavior that has traditionally been correlatedwith membership in a particular class, we assume that classmust be getting bigger. If more working-age men are jobless,for example, we assume the underclass must be getting bigger.The second error is that, once we decide a class is growing,we tend to assume that every form of behavior associated withmembership in that class is becoming more common. Havingconcluded the underclass is getting bigger, for example, weassume that dropout rates, crime and teen-age parenthood mustalso be rising.   But to understand what is happening to those at the bottomof American society, we need to examine their problems one ata time. Exaggerating the correlations among social problemscan have political costs as well. Portraying poverty,joblessness, illiteracy, violence, unwed motherhood and drugabuse as symptoms of a larger metaproblem, such as theunderclass, encourages people to look for metasolutions. Weare frequently told, for example, that &quot;piecemeal&quot; reform ispointless and that we need a &quot;comprehensive&quot; approach to theproblem of the underclass. Some even believe we need&quot;revolutionary&quot; change.   But if we cannot manage piecemeal reforms, looking formetasolutions is almost certain to be time wasted so far asthe American underclass is concerned. If we want to reducepoverty, joblessness, illiteracy, violence or despair, wewill surely need to change our institutions and attitudes inhundreds of small ways, not one big way.   ---   This is an adaptation of an article by Mr. Jencks in &quot;TheUrban Underclass,&quot; edited by Mr. Jencks and Paul Peterson andpublished this week by the Brookings Institution.
