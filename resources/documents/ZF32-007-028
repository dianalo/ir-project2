(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The $5,795 Eastman Kodak Ektaplus 7016 PS is a two-headed monster.andP;  Similarto the imminent four-function Hydra products that will combine a fax,scanner, copier, and printer in one, the Ektaplus 7016 PS is a combination ofthe last two features: This machine prints 8.5- by 11-inch copies at 6 pagesper minute and prints out text at a rated 16 ppm.andM;It being one up on other shared laser printers isn't enough for you, theEktaplus 7016 Ps also supports six printer emulations: Adobe PostScript,Diablo, Epson FX,HPGL,HP PCL 4, and IBM Proprinter.andP;  Most important for lasersharing, the Ektaplus 7016 can manage four different inputs simultaneously.andM;The Ektaplus 7016 is the PostScript version of Kodak's $4,495 Ekataplus 7016(discussed in the sidebar &quot;Kodak Ektaplus 7016: A Multifunction Solution forMultiuser Printing,&quot; May 28, 1991, and First Looks, March 26, 1991).andP;  TheEktaplus 7016, which includes the same features as the Ektaplus 7016 PS, canbe upgraded to PostScript for $1,995 (including 4MB of additional memory).andO;But that means that making the PostScript upgrade decision later will costyou an additional $700.andM;COPIER AND LASER PRINTERandM;In its standard configuration, the Ektaplus 7016 PS comes with a Centronicsparallel port, an RS232C serial interface, and room for two more ports.andO;Different settings can be stored for each port, and because all of the portsare active simultneously, it enables both PC and Macintosh users (using the$195 AppleTalk option) to access the printer without leaving their desks.andO;The Ektaplus 7016 PS automatically queues incoming print jobs, and printingcan be interrupted at any time to make copies.andP;  When the copying is complete,you just put the printer back on-line.andP;  If you forget to reactivate printingwhen you're done, the printer will return to the interrupted print job after60 seconds of inactivity.andM;Designed for small businesses and company departments, the Ektaplus 7016 PS's16- by 38- by 21-inch bulk means it requires a desk of its own.andP;  In fact, itlooks more like a copier than a printer.andP;  Fortunately, its straight-throughpaper path doesn't jam like an office copier.andP;  And while the control panel isless cluttered than most of today's copiers and printers, the Ektaplus 7016PS's 40-character LCD panel allows for adjustment of all the most commonlyused functions.andM;Inside, the Ektaplus 7016PS's 15,000-shee-per-month duty cycle relies on aKodak LED-array print engine, and the printer couples that with an opticalcopying system (rather than scanning and digitizing the image) to takeadvantage of its photoconductor belt.andM;Inexperienced users, however, will find the initial setup a labyrinth ofparts and consumables.andP;  A videotape and step-by-step diagrams in the owner'smanual help users with toner installation, but there are still a lot ofcomponents to juggle, including a fuser wick, a multiple-wire primarycharger, a sensitive photoconductor belt, a cleaning station, and a transfercharger.andP;  A successful installation rewards your efforts by automaticallykicking out a status page of all the Ektaplus 7016 PS's current settings.andM;PERFORMANCE ISSUESandM;Although the Ektaplus 7016 PS delivers excellent PostScript graphics, itsperformance on PC Magazine Labs' graphics speed test was a bit slow: 0.5graphics pages per minute using a 300-dot-per-inch LaserWriter driver.andP;  Onthe other hand, its PostScript text ran at 14.5 ppm, just a shade off its topHP PCL text speed of 14.7 ppm.andM;The only difficulty the Ektaplus 7016 PS faced was on PC Labs' PCL 4 torturetest, where it skipped to the end of the print job after encounteringthree-level nested macros.andP;  Eastman Kodak Co. has developed ROMs that solvethis problem but couldn't tell us when they'd be available.andP;  This is not,however, a problem that will give you trouble when you are running typicalapplications.andM;Outside of this difficulty, the Ektaplus 7016 PS turned out PCL 4 graphics ata respectable 2.4 gppm on PC Labs' tests and yielded smooth curves.andP;  Comparedwith the HP LaserJet IIISi's output, the Ektaplus 7016 PS's gray shadeslooked washed out (a result of its &quot;write white&quot; technology, which causes theelectrical charge to be removed from white areas of the film, leaving thenegatively charged areas to attract positively charged toner particles and toprint as black).andP;  A simple adjustment using the Ektaplus 7016 PS's controlpanel, however, increases the print density for darker blacks.andM;To the standard HP LaserJet Series II resident fonts, Courier and LinePrinter, Eastman Kodak adds Helvetica and Roman typefaces, and there are also35 scalable PostScript fonts already on-board.andP;  The unit can acceptdownloadable fonts, but a resident slashed zero is not available.andP;  This fall,Eastman Kodak expects to address the popularity of Microsoft's GUI interfaceby introducing a special driver for Microsoft Windows, 3.0.andM;The Ektaplus 7016 PS will not handle duplexing duties, but it is capable ofautomatically switching from one cassette to the other.andP;  It can be set todeliver the printouts in a face-up or face-down orientation.andP;  A side-mountedenvelope slot eliminates the need to remove a paper cassette for manualprinting.andP;  Individual letterhead stock can also be fed by hand over the topof the cassettes.andM;To increase customer support, Eastman Kodak has extended its original 90-dayparts-and-labor warranty on the Ektaplus 7016 PS to one year witn on-siteservice and a toll-free technical support line.andP;  Prices on the Ektaplus 7016PS--sold only through dealers--should run 20 percent or more below listprice, placing it within striking distance of other shared laser printersthat don't offer the advantage of simultaneously active ports or a copier.andO;With an estimated cost per page of 3 cents, it's a little more costly tooperate than some of the shared laser printers in this roundup, butconsidering the Eastman Kodak Ektaplus 7016 PS's advantages, many businesseswill agree that two heads are better than one.andM;FACT FILEandM;Eastman Kodak Co., Printer Products Division, 901 Elmgrove Rd., Rochester, NY14653;
