The study, billed as the first comprehensive global assessmentof air pollution, said many countries have made progress inreducing air pollution but that the situation is still veryserious, especially in Third World nations.   The 100-page survey, prepared by the World Health Organizationand the U.N. Environment Program, is based on data from up to 15years of monitoring in more than 60 countries.   Dr. Michael Gwynne, director of the environment program's GlobalMonitoring System, said the survey represents the ``mostcomprehensive, detailed and informative study ever carried out.''   The study focuses on two main pollutants _ sulfur dioxide andsuspended particulate matter. Emissions of sulfur dioxide areestimated at up to 180 million tons per year, and emissions ofsmoke and dust are estimated at more than 100 million tons a year.   Continuous exposure, especially among children, can result inacute or chronic respiratory problems.   Dr. Gwynne said 625 million people, mostly in developingcountries, are exposed to ``unacceptable levels of sulfur dioxide''and that 550 million more live just within the range of tolerablelevels set by the World Health Organization.   He said dust and smoke are worse and estimated that about 1.25billion city dwellers live in ``unacceptable conditions'' and 200million more live in conditions that are ``only marginal.''   Data from 54 cities suggest that the average annual sulfurdioxide level during the 1980-84 monitoring period was highest inMilan, Italy.   But Seoul, Rio de Janeiro and Paris were also among the citieswhere the average range was above WHO guidelines. Melbourne,Australia, Tel Aviv, Israel, Toronto, Chicago and Munich were amongthose with the lowest averages.   A separate 33-city survey said sulfur dioxide concentrationswere declining in 21 cities, all in the industrialized West, whilethe upward trend was strongest in New Delhi, India. In Poland, itsoared by 80 percent within a decade.   Emissions in the Soviet Union were not included in the listing,but the study cited an estimate of 28 million tons in 1979, wellabove the United States' estimated total of 23 million tons.   Suspended particle emissions also decreased in Westerncountries, while going up spectacularly in Poland.   In 18 out of 41 cities, the annual suspended particle emissionsaverage was above the WHO limit. Kuwait topped the list, which alsoincluded New Delhi, Beijing, Jakarta, Indonesia and Manila,Philippines. Chicago was the only Western city above the WHO limit.   The study said nitrogen oxides, produced mainly by automobiles,are rising in several of the larger European cities, includingLondon, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, West Germany. It noted that mostEuropean countries do not have the stringent standards forautomobile emissions that the United States and Japan haveimplemented.   The issue of nitrogen oxides is also of concern because of theirrole in the formation of other oxidants, including ozone. The studysaid there are ``worrying indications'' that ozone levels are onthe rise in ``many European and North American cities.''   The study is less detailed on emissions of carbon monoxide,which are believed to exceed the combined emissions of all othermajor air pollutants.   Again, most Western countries reported reduced carbon monoxideemissions, while they were up in Poland and Hungary. Increased useof unleaded gasoline contributed to an even sharper reduction inestimated lead emissions in Western countries, with the UnitedStates total down from 147,000 tons a year in 1973-75 to 21,100tons a decade later.   In developing countries, automobile emissions of carbon monoxideand lead are increasingly major issues of concern, the report says.   ``Careful urban planning is needed to ... minimize the buildupof these pollutants,'' it says.</TEXT></DOC>
