A day earlier, the government announced it intended to cut itsforces from 480,000 members to 400,000 by the mid-1990s, but onlyif current East-West talks on reducing conventional forces inEurope are successful.   It would be the biggest reduction in West Germany's armed forcesever.   But Andreas von Buelow, a federal lawmaker with the oppositionSocial Democratic Party, said Defense Minister GerhardStoltenberg's plan doesn't do enough to encourage disarmament andto help overcome divisions within Europe.   ``Why don't you (Stoltenberg) work toward a structure thatallows you to actively hurry along the demilitarization of theEast-West conflict that would still protect our security?'' Buelowasked Stoltenberg at a heated parliamentary debate.   The Social Democrats demanded that compulsory military servicebe cut from 15 months to 12 months.   Buelow also said West Germany and NATO should be thinking ofpossible ways to alter the character of the armed forces so thereweren't so many offense-oriented elements.   But Stoltenberg said his plan foresaw the ``most significantnew-ordering in the history of the Federal Republic's (WestGermany's) armed forces.''   Pointing out that West Germany remained NATO's front-line state,Stoltenberg said the country's armed forces are an ``essentialfactor for stability in Europe'' and that this must not bejeopardized.   ``It would be disastrous to put into question the alliance's andthe (West German) army's roles as key elements for peace,''Stoltenberg said.   In announcing its plan Wednesday, the government said it wastaking the tentative steps to cut down on costs, because of WestGermany's low birth rate which means there will be fewer men forthe armed forces, and because of the changing political situationin Europe.   The demise of Communist governments in Eastern Europe hastriggered a new debate in West Germany about what kinds of changesare possible within the country's own armed forces and within NATOas a whole.   The Social Democrats and the leftist Greens party have beenleading the calls for far-reaching changes, saying the threat fromthe East bloc has decreased dramatically.   Kohl's government says it wants quicker progress in arms controland disarmament, But it has also pledged West Germany will remain aNATO member even if events in Europe eventually permit unificationof the two German nations.   Some liberal members of Kohl's government have strayed fromofficial government pronouncements on military matters.   Education Minister Juergen Moellemann, a member of the FreeDemocrat Party, junior partner in Kohl's coalition government, hassaid he thought 350,000 soldiers in the country's armed forces anda 12-month military service term would be sufficient.</TEXT></DOC>
