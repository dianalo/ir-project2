But unlike such landmark measures as the 1964 Civil RightsAct or last year's Americans With Disabilities Act, the newlaw won't set forth major new requirements for employers tochange their personnel practices.</LP><TEXT>   The civil rights measure approved by the Senate last weekis expected to pass the House this week and swiftly be signedinto law by President Bush. The law will extend for the firsttime punitive damages to victims of employment discriminationbased on sex or disability as well as race, and will alsocounter seven Supreme Court decisions, most of them from1989, that made it more difficult for job-bias plaintiffs towin lawsuits.   Under the new civil rights law, the price employers payfor getting caught intentionally discriminating againstsomeone, which has increased sharply in the past decade, isexpected to rise at an even faster clip. The greatest impactwill probably be a substantial increase in cash awards towomen and the disabled who sue for deliberate job bias.   Moreover, employers may find it somewhat more difficult towin lawsuits alleging unintentional discrimination than wasthe case in the past two years. That's because employers'burden of proof, which was eased in the 1989 Supreme Courtcase Wards Cove Packing Co. vs. Atonio, will now return tothe more difficult standard that prevailed prior to thatdecision.   Consider the 1988 case of Jimmy Young, a black truckdriver who sued Von's Market in Los Angeles for racediscrimination, alleging intentional infliction of emotionaldistress.   Mr. Young's supervisors called him &quot;nigger,&quot; told racistjokes, gave him inferior equipment, and took runs away fromhim and gave them to junior drivers. He complained to noavail. Under extreme stress, Mr. Young, who suffers fromdiabetes, experienced a rapid decline in health, andeventually his ailments left him completely disabled.   Von's rejected Mr. Young's $1 million settlement offer,and in 1988 a jury awarded him $12.1 million, including $10.7million in punitive damages. The $10.7 million award wassubsequently reduced to $650,000, and after an appeal byVon's both parties settled at an amount believed to be aboutthe same.   For all his suffering, Mr. Young was in one sense lucky.Someone who had sued back then for discrimination based onsex or a possible disability would have been able to win backpay and reinstatement but wouldn't have been eligible toreceive punitive damages.   That will now change. In effect, the new law says that jobbias based on sex, disability, religion or national originwill now be punished almost as severely as employmentdiscrimination based on race.   The change comes too late for Helen Brooms, an industrialnurse who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against RegalTube Co. after her boss showed her obscene pictures, madeoffensive comments, grabbed her arm and threatened to killher if she moved. Though Ms. Brooms got away from the man,she fell down a flight of stairs in the process.   Ms. Brooms won her lawsuit in 1989, receiving back pay.But she was unable to receive compensation for three years'worth of psychotherapy for depression resulting from theincident, or for her medical bills from the fall. That'sbecause under previous law, victims of sex-based job biaswere ineligible not only for punitive damages but also forsuch &quot;compensatory&quot; damages as pain-and-suffering awards.(Sex-discrimination victims did get their medical bills paidwhen the court determined that the company's medicalinsurance would have picked up the tab.)   Now victims of sexual bias in the workplace will beeligible for both compensatory and punitive damages, as willvictims of discrimination based on disability, religion ornational origin. The amount of punitive damages available tothese groups won't be unlimited, though, as it is for victimsof race discrimination. For companies with 15 to 100employees, the cap will be $50,000; between 101 and 200employees, $100,000; between 201 and 500 employees, $200,000;and more than 500 employees, $300,000. Companies with fewerthan 15 employers will be exempt from the law.   Access to these new damages is sure to fuel furtherexpansion of sex and disability-bias claims. Just how much itwill fuel them is a matter of much debate between civilrights groups and employers.   &quot;It's a lawyers' boondoggle,&quot; says Michael Kane, vicepresident for regulatory affairs of USG Corp., Chicago, abuilding products maker. &quot;It will force corporations, whetherthey like it or not, to settle meritless claims forsubstantial sums.&quot;   But Ellen Vargyas, senior counsel at the National Women'sLaw Center, says employers sounded the same sort of alarms,which turned out to be exaggerated, about the 1964 civilrights law. And the maximum $300,000 in punitive damages inthe new law, she says, is &quot;not exactly what I would call apot of gold.&quot;   One way to gauge potential damages to be received by newlyeligible groups is to examine the record for race-biasvictims in recent years. A study commissioned by the NationalWomen's Law Center, a nonprofit group, found only three casesduring the 1980s in which race-bias awards for punitive andcompensatory damages exceeded $200,000. A separate analysisby the pro-management Employment Policy Foundation found thatfrom 1985 to 1990, awards in such cases averaged $128,000 --still well under the new law's top cap.   Even for the groups that now have only limited access todamages, however, the number of lawsuits alleging employmentdiscrimination has risen sharply since the 1970s. Accordingto figures compiled by the American Bar Association,employment rights lawsuits filed in federal district courtgrew 77% between 1979 and 1988. The bulk of that increaseoccurred in the early part of the decade.   In addition, a recent report by 9 to 5, a nonprofit groupfor working women, found that job bias complaints filed withthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where job biassuits often begin, increased 9% between 1980 and 1990, to89,295 in 1990. Complaints of sex discrimination grew at aparticularly fast rate of 14%. Now that increase willprobably pick up tempo, especially for the disabled, who alsowon new job-bias protection in last year's disabilities law.   Throughout the long negotiations over the civil rightsbill, the political focus was on the issue of unintentionaldiscrimination. Such lawsuits focus on employment practiceslike job tests, which may indirectly discriminate againstcertain groups. Opponents of the bill, who until recentlyincluded President Bush, argued that it would cause employersto hire and promote on the basis of racial quotas.   Eventually, language was found that both sides agreed tolive with. Practically speaking, the result will be a moredifficult burden of proof for employers that are sued forunintentional discrimination. But the burden will be nogreater than it was before the 1989 Supreme Court decisionthat the law seeks to overcome.   Punitive damages are granted only in cases of intentionaldiscrimination; they aren't available in cases ofunintentional bias. As a result, the new access to damageswon't directly affect the question of quotas. But somebusiness groups claim that it will do so indirectly.According to this logic, employers who want to establish thattheirs is not the sort of company to intentionallydiscriminate might do so by hiring fixed percentages ofwomen, blacks and the disabled. &quot;The only way to get out ofcourt is never to get in it,&quot; says Pete Lunnie, laborrelations director for the National Association ofManufacturers.   But Thomas Henderson, deputy director for litigation atthe Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, calls thisa &quot;tortured&quot; argument, adding, &quot;we are simply talking abouteffective law enforcement here.&quot;   (See related articles: &quot;Some Specifics About the New Law&quot;and &quot;Enterprise: Small Businesses Will Experience Very BigImpact&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 4, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
