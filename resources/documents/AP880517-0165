Beretta USA, a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi BerettaSpA, has submitted a plan to deal with the cracking problem and theArmy expects to resume accepting deliveries next month, said PaulPowell, a spokesman for the Army's Armament, Munitions and ChemicalCommand.   In the meantime, though, the Army has been forced to start a newtest program to determine why two slide bolts on M-9 Berettascracked while being fired, throwing shards of metal back into thechests of the shooters. A similar incident occurred with anon-military Beretta made for commercial sale that was being testedby the Navy.   No one was injured in the three incidents, which occurred latelast year and in February, Powell said.   ``But we don't like the fact that if a slide ever did break itcould go back and whack a guy in the face,'' said Col. RichardWilliams, the Army manager for the Beretta program.   The problems with the handgun contract were first disclosed thisweek by the trade publication ``Defense Week'' and subsequentlyconfirmed by Army officials.   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. The Army,serving as the executive buying agent for all the services, awardedBeretta an initial contract worth $75 million for 316,000 pistols.   According to Powell, 109,000 guns had been delivered before thedelivery suspension in November. All told, the spokesman saidBeretta would fall about 36,000 pistols behind in its deliveriesbefore shipments resume in June.   Beretta is about to face a new, congressionally orderedcompetition with the Massachusetts gunmaker Smith andamp; Wesson and anyother interested arms maker for the next 9mm gun contract. Powelldeclined to discuss how the production problems might affectBeretta's chances.   The Army said the first problem with the Beretta surfaced inNovember when quality-control testers discovered the pistols coulddevelop hairline cracks on part of the frame. The problem wasconsidered minor and posed no danger to soldiers firing the gun,but the Army had made it clear earlier it would not tolerate anycracking and insisted the problem be fixed, Powell said.   The second problem involving the slide bolt _ which is thrownbackward after a shot is fired as part of the process of chamberinga new round _ materialized during Navy and Army tests after thedelivery suspension began.   Beretta maintains that the slide failures occurred only afterspecial ammunition was fired.   ``U.S. government engineers and technicians have extensivelyexamined the metallurgy, dimensions and manufacturing of the pistoland can find nothing which indicates that the cause of the breakagelies with the weapon,'' the company said in a statement.   Powell disputed that statement in part, saying the Army had notconcluded that special ammunition caused the problem.   ``We are still running tests to determine the cause of thisproblem,'' the spokesman said. ``We're not prepared to say it's theammunition. It could be a design flaw, ammunition, themanufacturing process or misuse of the weapon. We don't know yet.''   In the meantime, the Navy has suspended all firearms trainingwith the new Beretta and the Army has ordered the slides on itsguns be replaced after every 3,000 rounds fired.   The slide on one of the military-issue guns that failed did soafter 4,500 rounds had been fired and the other after 6,007 rounds.The commercial Beretta failed after 30,000 rounds, Powell said.</TEXT></DOC>
