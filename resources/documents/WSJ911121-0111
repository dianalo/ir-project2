The model for the clampdown on oil purchases would be thesanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq after it invadedKuwait, U.S. officials said. In Libya's case, the cutoffwould be imposed only after the country is publicly warned tostop supporting terrorism.</LP><TEXT>   It isn't clear whether European allies, despite Britishand French anger at Libya's terrorist activities, areprepared to participate in such a broad action. The U.S.already has imposed a ban on U.S. economic dealings withLibya, so any new pressure would require Europeancooperation. One official suggested that European reaction tothe idea has been mixed.   The sanctions idea is being explored in high-leveldiplomatic discussions that follow last week's indictment oftwo Libyan intelligence agents for the bombing of Pan Amflight 103 over Scotland in 1988. Before the indictments wereissued, France issued arrest warrants for four other Libyansfor the September 1989 bombing of a UTA airliner over Africa.   The U.S. intends to transmit its indictment formally tothe Libyan government in the next few days, officials said.It will be relayed through the Belgian government, whichrepresents U.S. interests in the Libyan capital of Tripolibecause the U.S. Embassy there has been closed. As part ofthat process, the U.S. will request that the two indictedLibyans be extradited to stand trial.   The administration is considering following that step bydemanding that Libya take specific steps to get rid ofterrorist groups it has harbored and to disavow its supportof terrorism.   If Libya failed to respond, the international communitythen would impose new economic sanctions, officials said. Theadministration would like, in addition to an oil embargo, forother nations to agree to cut off airline links with Libya.That is considered particularly appropriate because theterrorist actions in which Libya is implicated involveattacks on civilian airliners and the alleged participantswere affiliated with Libya's national airline.   The U.S. bombed Libya in 1986 after accusing it ofconducting terrorist acts against Americans in Europe, butadministration officials say military action isn't likelynow. An attack might be difficult to justify because the PanAm 103 bombing occurred three years ago.   In addition, a military strike could disrupt the nascentMiddle East peace conference, which was launched after monthsof diplomacy by Secretary of State James Baker. Syria warnedthat military action against Libya could disrupt the peaceprocess. Also, a military move now might prompt radicalgroups in Lebanon to stop releasing Western hostages.   But the administration thinks this is a good time to pressLibya on the terrorism issue. Officials say they have strongevidence, which would be disclosed at any trial, linking thetwo indicted Libyan agents to senior officials of the Libyangovernment.   In addition, Britain and France have incentives tocooperate in moves against Libya -- France because of the UTAairliner and Britain because the Pan Am 103 explosionoccurred over British territory in Scotland.</TEXT></DOC>
