The EPA is approving these revisions because theyare consistent with the previously approved regulations. The revisionsare primarily administrative and either strengthen or retain the StateImplementation Plan (SIP). The following revisions include minor changesto existing rules which are expected to result in an increased effectivenessand enforceability of those rules. Fresno County APCD Rules 102, and 111;Placer County APCD Rules 101, 201, and 305; and South Coast AQMD Rule 209will either maintain or strengthen the existing SIP, therefore, EPA isapproving them under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Fresno County Rules 609, 613, 613.1, 613.2, 613.3, 613.4, and 614 concernair pollution control contingency plans required by 40 CFR 51.152, ``Contingencyplans'', under Subpart H, ``Prevention of Air Pollution Emergency Episodes.''The Fresno County rules listed above require control measures for stationarysources and traffic abatement plans during emergency episodes. The contingencyplans are federally approvable once they are approved by the Air PollutionControl Officer. These rules are generally equivalent to the existing federalrequirements and meet, in part, the requirements of andSection; 51.152. <ITAG tagnum="84">EPA Action </ITAG>EPA's review of these new and revised rules finds them consistent withthe Clean Air Act, 40 CFR Part 51, and EPA policy. Therefore, EPA is takingfinal action to approve these rules under section 110 of the Clean AirAct. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment action and anticipates no adversecomments. This action will be effective June 9, 1989 unless, within 30days of its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical commentswill be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective June9, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Process </ITAG>Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709). The Office of Management and Budget has exempted these rules from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 9, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
