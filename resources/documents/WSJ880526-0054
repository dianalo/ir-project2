Southern California Edison sought a $484.1 million increase to offset anticipated higher fuel costs over the next 12 months. The commission said it would allow a $200 million increase effective next month and would review the rest. A decision on the deferred amount is expected in September.    Under the new rates, a typical residential user's utility bill will increase about $1.62 a month, to $44.49, the commission said. The decision won't have any impact on the utility's profit, a Southern California Edison spokesman said.    Last year, the company had net income of $788.6 million, or $3.39 a share, on revenue of $5.49 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
