Blinder's Aug. 21 letter to theeditor responding to my Aug. 13 editorial-page article,&quot;Promises the Supply-Siders Made -- And Didn't&quot;: His letteris a sad commentary on the state of integrity in today'sacademic world; it clearly demonstrates that he is moreconcerned with protecting his reputation than the truth. In1987 the Princeton economics professor published a book thatcontained incorrect statements about President Reagan'seconomic program -- statements that were directly counter toall the official presidential campaign and governmentdocuments that dealt with economic policy.   In the fall of 1987 I wrote to Prof. Blinder, telling himI was writing a book and asking him if he had any solidevidence or research to support his claims. He didn't produceany then and doesn't have any now -- four years later.Apparently he has chosen to ignore brazenly his serious errorand -- in David Baltimore style -- simply deny any slipshodscholarship. But the issue remains: Has Prof. Blinderviolated the most basic canon of scholarship by pretendingthat something false is true? Watergate proved that the crimeof cover-up can easily dwarf the offense. In his latestattempt to deal with any criticism of his scholarship, Prof.Blinder, at best, is trying disingenuously to change thesubject and, at worst, edging dangerously close to lying.</LP><TEXT>   Martin Anderson   Senior Fellow   Hoover Institution   Stanford, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
