The close-out electronics distributor set up a $2.1 million reserve for the liquidation of the home-shopping business.    Entertainment Marketing had net income of $894,498, or seven cents a share, in the year earlier quarter. Sales rose 76% to $40.9 million from $23.3 million.    The company said it had tried to sell the unit since Sept. 15, but hadn't received sufficient interest to justify continued efforts. &quot;Therefore, our board has decided to terminate CDN's operations on Dec. 31, 1987,&quot; said Elias Zinn, chairman, &quot;and end the cash hemorrhaging this division has caused our company.&quot;    Entertainment Marketing also said its investment in Crazy Eddie Inc. is carried on its books at $3.2 million, a write-down of $9 million from its stock purchases in May and June. Mr. Zinn and a group of investors took control of the ailing Edison, N.J.-based electronics retailer in November after a proxy fight.    &quot;We believe our Crazy Eddie investment is turning around,&quot; Mr. Zinn said.    Third-quarter results include net from continuing operations of $854,669, or seven cents a share; a loss from discontinued operations of $3.6 million; and a gain of $337,993 from repurchasing debentures. Net in the year-ago period includes $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share, from continuing operations and a $307,784 loss from discontinued operations.    For the first nine months, the company had a net loss of $1.3 million, including profit from continuing operations of $4.3 million, or 34 cents a share; losses from discontinued operations of $6.1 million; and a gain of $603,192 from the debenture sale. A year earlier, net was $1.6 million, or 15 cents a share, including profit from continuing operations of $1.9 million, or 18 cents a share, and losses from discontinued operations of $303,589.    Nine-month sales more than doubled to $103.4 million from $49.6 million.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Entertainment Marketing closed at $3.625 a share, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
