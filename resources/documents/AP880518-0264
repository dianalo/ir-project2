KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate on Wednesday overwhelminglyrepelled the first attack by Republican conservatives on theU.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.   The Senate voted 91-6 to shelve a bid by Sen. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., to stop debate on the treaty on grounds that Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev was not duly authorized to sign it.   The Senate's rejection of that claim was the first test vote onthe the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF Treaty. The treatywould ban all U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400miles.   Gorbachev's signature was invalid, Helms claimed, because hesigned as general secretary of the Communist Party of the SovietUnion, not as a duly authorized representative of the Soviet state,because he is only the head of a political party, not an officialmember of the Soviet government.   The attempt to derail Senate consideration of the pact cameafter senators of both parties hailed the treaty as an importantfirst step toward worldwide arms control and appealed for swiftratification before President Reagan's summit meeting withGorbachev in Moscow. The summit begins May 29.   But as debate got under way, Helms, apparently beginning a longseries of delaying tactics, raised a point of order and claimedthat the treaty was invalid because Gorbachev's signature was on it.   ``The fact remains that this document now at the desk is notbinding on the Soviet Union,'' Helms contended. ``It is only anagreement between the president of the United States and the headof a foreign political party.''   Said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, ``If the time comes the Sovietsfind it convenient to roll out the SS-20's they may have hidden,they can say the treaty was signed by an invalid signature ofsomeone who had no business doing it.''   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said it was clear from the circumstances whenthe treaty was signed last Dec. 8 that Gorbachev had ``fullauthority to represent his nation.''   ``It is clear that Mr. Gorbachev and no one else in thatdelegation was the chief representative of the Soviet Union,'' Pellsaid.   ``Treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise judgment,''said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chosen to lead the debate on theRepublican side of the aisle. ``There is no substance whatsoever tothe claim that the treaty was not legally signed.''   Helms bridled at suggestions that he was raising technicalobjections to the treaty for the sake of delay, saying: ``What isoccurring is not dilatory but is instead and in fact deliberative.''   Those voting against tabling the Helms point of order wereHelms, Symms and Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; James McClure,R-Idaho; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.   Not voting were: Sens. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del; Lawton Chiles,D-Fla.; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.   Earlier, a lengthy wrangle broke out of the kind that may makeit impossible to meet the deadline of the summit's opening May 29.   The issue: how to assure that the commonly understood meaning ofthe treaty at the time it is ratified is binding and will not inthe future be re-interpreted without the consent of the Senate.   The controversy arises from the Reagan administration's proposedre-interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile or ABM Treatyto permit the deployment of a Star Wars strategic defense system.   The issue is intensely partisan. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,opposing an amendment to address the issue in the current treaty,warned of a lengthy debate to defeat it and said it was ``a boobytrap'' that could ``sink the whole ratification process.''   ``It creates confusion and confrontation ... a turf battleextraordinaire in which the Senate is seeking primacy in thetreaty-making process.''   Specter contended that ``the administration seems to be havingmore trouble with the U.S. Senate than with the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.   But other senators said that if the Senate does not address theissue on the missile treaty it would appear as if it has agreed tothe doctrine that a treaty can be re-interpreted, on grounds thatwhat the Senate was originally told about it did not represent thefull truth.   ``If we do not do this the Senate's role in treaty making willbe completely obliterated,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.   The White House, meanwhile, stressed the importance of ratifyingthe treaty quickly.   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker said that ratifyingthe treaty before the May 29 summit would be ``a major plus'' whilefailure to do so ``might have some effect on the Soviets'willingness to go forward with the next treaty,'' Baker said.   ``It would not be a disaster, but it would be adisappointment,'' Baker said. ``...I can visualize some Sovietpersonality saying we (the United States) haven't ratified anytreaty since 1972, so what's the purpose of this.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas announced theappointment of Lugar, a former chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, to manage the treaty debate for the GOP.   That post normally would have gone to Helms, the seniorRepublican on the Foreign Relations panel. But Helms is the mostoutspoken opponent of the pact, vowing to vote against it even ifhe is the only senator to do so.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters:``This treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves ifwe deal only with those serious, legitimate amendments that oughtto be dealt with on this issue.''   But Dole and Byrd said they expect a number of amendments to beoffered and cautioned that the pact could be delayed.   ``This treaty is an important symbol,'' said Sen. Brock Adams,D-Wash., as the first full day of debate on the treaty opened.   ``To build on this important symbol it is absolutely necessarythat we indicate to our NATO allies that we believe in this treaty,that we all stand together,'' he said.   Adams and several other senators described the pact as abuilding block toward agreement on a Strategic Arms ReductionTreaty which would cut long-range nuclear arms by up to 50 percent.   ``This is a window in time that might not repeat itself forseveral decades,'' Adams said. ``There are significant groups inboth the United States and the Soviet Union, minorities in myopinion, that don't trust and won't sign any agreement.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the chamber's deputy GOP leader,called the treaty ``a very small first step, but a necessary one.''   Noting that in the years since World War II the two superpowersnever have been as close to actually cutting back their nuclearforces as they are now, Simpson told the Senate:   ``After 44 years of talk, finally there is a little dual pointof convergence that is important to capture. ... Instead of talkingthe talk, we're finally walking the walk,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
