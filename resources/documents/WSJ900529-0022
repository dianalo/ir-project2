The question: How should the U.S. military handle closeair support for its troops? Mr. Rutan's solution: a $2million combat plane made out of a plastic-like composite ofgraphite and fiberglass designed to be more maneuverable,simpler to build and maintain and far, far cheaper than anyU.S. combat aircraft currently on the drawing boards.</LP><TEXT>   It is a solution the Pentagon doesn't want to hear. TheAir Force told him it hasn't any need for such a plane. TheArmy was even less hospitable. Officials, he says, told himthey regarded his plane as a threat to the Army's $39 billionlight-helicopter program.   &quot;Rutan's airplane is not under our consideration,&quot; saysLt. Col. Don Black, an Air Force spokesman, who says theA-16, an F-16 fighter modified with more electronic equipmentand safety devices, is the service's top candidate for closeair support. The defense secretary, he adds, will make aselection from a number of candidates -- which don't includethe Rutan plane -- later this year.   The 46-year-old Mr. Rutan has faced challenges before. Heis the designer of Voyager, the first plane that flew nonstoparound the world, and creator of the sailwing device thatbrought the America's Cup back to the U.S. But the innerworkings of the Pentagon have him baffled. &quot;I never knew muchabout the politics of this. I just heard about it from theperiphery,&quot; he explains.   Some Pentagon veterans see a parallel between Mr. Rutan'sexperience and that of Christopher Spencer, inventor of thefirst reliable repeating military rifle. After the Armyrejected his idea in 1860, Mr. Spencer went to the WhiteHouse and got President Lincoln to try a few shots. Then theArmy wanted it.   &quot;This will only get inside (the Pentagon) if there is asuper champion around someplace,&quot; says Robert Costello, theDefense Department's former acquisition chief. He tried tospend $1 million in Pentagon money to help Mr. Rutan buildhis prototype two years ago. Mr. Costello resigned, however,before the deal was completed and Mr. Rutan finished theprototype himself.   In theory, at least, he has the right idea at the righttime. He says his close-air-support plane sells for between$2 million and $4 million, depending on electronic options.Estimates of the cost of future competitive weapons systems-- the Army's light helicopter and the Air Force's modifiedF-16 fighter -- begin at around $13 million each and go wellbeyond $20 million, depending on how the costs arecalculated, and they are being calculated very carefully now,especially on Capitol Hill.   Moreover, the Army's current helicopter program, the AH-64Apache, is in big trouble. A recent General Accounting Officereport says that the $12 billion program has produced agunship that is so complicated that less than half of its 500Apaches are combat-capable at any given time.   Close air support is basically the art of shooting downenemy helicopters and destroying tanks and troopconcentrations, often within a few yards of U.S. forces. Itrequires maneuverability, good vision and, above all,precision.   It was the Army's own experiments at Fort Lewis, Wash., inthe early 1980s that the potency of Mr. Rutan's planesagainst helicopter gunships was discovered. Called the HighTechnology Test Bed, the project was designed to see whetherthere was inexpensive commercial technology that could helpthe Army. There was.   A veteran helicopter-gunship pilot from the Vietnam War,Maj. Jim Kreutz, put together two light, single-seater,recreational airplanes from kits sold by Mr. Rutan. Maj.Kreutz flew the tiny, composite planes, called the &quot;Long-EZ,&quot;against helicopter gunships in over 80 missions, recordingthe results with gun cameras.   &quot;It wasn't a 100% win situation, but I would say weprobably won 90% of the time,&quot; recalls Mr. Kreutz, who hassince resigned from the Army. The little, hard-to-see planealmost always had the helicopter in its sights first andcould easily outfly it, he says, by staying above thegunship, which is unable to shoot upward without destroyingits rotor.   Mr. Rutan was retained by the Army to develop the plansfor a bigger plane that could carry a big gun. Then,suddenly, everything seemed to go downhill. The Fort Lewisproject was closed down and Maj. Kreutz was told his careerwas in danger. He resigned in 1985, and is currently anaviation consultant in Graham, Wash.   Mr. Rutan and Mr. Kreutz were operating dangerously closeto the invisible political seam between the Air Force and theArmy, an area of much turf fighting over the years. SinceVietnam, the Air Force has agreed not to interfere with theArmy's plans for helicopter gunships as long as the Armydoesn't use airplanes with guns.   Nonetheless, Mr. Rutan, a former Air Force test engineer,built a fancier version of what the Army had specified, usinghis own funds during slack time at his factory at Mojave,Calif. (Mr. Rutan's company, Scaled Composites Inc., is now asubsidiary of Wyman Gordon Co., Worcester, Mass.)   He borrowed a turbofan engine long used on business jetsand installed a machine gun that is widely used in themilitary services. He designed the plane with simplemechanics and electronics that can be fixed in the field.   The result, which he calls the Ares, made its maidenflight in February, but the services haven't accepted hisoffer to let them test it in simulated combat situations for$3,500 an hour. &quot;They (the services) are going to fight likehell against this for a long time,&quot; predicts Rep. Denny Smith(R., Ore.), a former Navy pilot who flew close-air-supportmissions in Vietnam.   Rep. Smith, whose exposure of faulty Pentagon testingpractices doomed the Army's projected $5 billion Divadanti-aircraft-gun program, believes the Rutan plane might wincompetitive tests because the use of fast-moving jets forclose air support often gives pilots very difficult,split-second choices.   &quot;If the Air Force doesn't want to fly it,&quot; says thecongressman, &quot;the Army should be given a chance to own someand use them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
