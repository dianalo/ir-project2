In 1983, Mr. Mallya inherited a liquor empire that hisfather built through shrewd acquisitions and by personallyinspecting invoices. The son has a different style -- helikes computers, corporate jets and subordinates with MBAs.He is determined to build the first Indian multinational,even if Indian tax and foreign-exchange regulations force himto run it from England and Dubai.</LP><TEXT>   Also, he's tired of the stigma of being a liquor baron intradition-bound India. To get greater social standing, Mr.Mallya is altering his empire in the same hungry way hecollects yachts, thoroughbred horses and vintage RollsRoyces.   &quot;I could have retired at the age of 28 and had a verycomfortable life,&quot; says Mr. Mallya in his snug Surrey study.&quot;But I had this burning desire to prove myself. And thatambition has grown.&quot;   It remains to be seen if Mr. Mallya's expansion plans willsucceed. But his story illustrates the startling generationalchange taking place in largely family controlled Indianindustry. Superbrats like Mr. Mallya are bringing new ideas,methods and collaborations into India -- with mixed approvalfrom their elders.   &quot;My age is my worst liability,&quot; Mr. Mallya concedes.&quot;Indians cannot stomach the fact that a 34-year-old isrunning a company this size.&quot;   UB Group goes back to 1948, when Vittal Mallya, Mr.Mallya's father, used stock-market profits to buy threeBritish-owned breweries and a food company in newlyindependent India. Eight years later, he bought McDowell andamp;Co., a wine and spirits trading house, which he convertedinto a distiller.   By the 1970s, his company was the second-largest distillerand brewer in India. But in 1977, the government of PrimeMinister Morarji Desai declared prohibition. It was then thatthe elder Mr. Mallya took a gamble and purchased fourbreweries and six distilleries.   The Desai government fell, prohibition was canceled andthe group was suddenly India's largest liquor company. Aboutthe same time, Vittal Mallya acquired an electrical-workscompany in Mysore and a petrochemical plant. &quot;He not onlytook a very bold step forward in our traditional business,&quot;says Mr. Mallya. &quot;But he also started hedging our bets.&quot;   By 1983, when the older Mr. Mallya died, the group hadannual sales of 2.3 billion rupees ($220 million at 1983exchange rates) and was in the alcohol and food businesses,petrochemicals, batteries and pharmaceuticals (as Indianpartner of Hoechst AG of West Germany).   Young Mr. Mallya, the only child, was 28 that year. Afteruniversity studies, he spent years in various factoriesconnected with the group, including distilleries in centralIndia, a Hoechst unit in New Jersey and six months as aproduction foreman in a Bristol, England, paint factory. Heworked hard and partied even harder. By his late 20s, Mr.Mallya had earned a reputation for his social life.   Today, to hold together a fast-growing and widespreadempire, he takes 20 to 40 airplane flights a month, workspast midnight and spends hours a day at the telephone. Hereserves weekends for expensive pastimes, including his 110racehorses and 150 vintage cars. He likes parties, jewelryand yachts -- he owns a 70-footer in England and a 40-footerin Bombay.   Many wondered if the playboy could handle the familyempire. But with the family controlling 51% of UB, he had notrouble dismissing others' claims to the throne. He took overon Oct. 19, 1983.   &quot;That's when the 12- and 14-hour working days started,&quot; hesays. &quot;When I sat in the chair and had 10 directors sittingaround me, I realized the buck stops with me. There was nodaddy upstairs to go running to.   &quot;I sat down with a huge piece of paper,&quot; he recalls, &quot;drewboxes and lines and found that every manager in the groupreported to the chairman. Every single invoice from every UBcompany came to him: He went through them randomly to seethat the billing was right.&quot; Mr. Mallya reorganized. &quot;From 40people reporting to me, it shrunk to 10.&quot;   Then he looked for ambitious people to fill managementpositions. &quot;I wanted people who were young, who could relateto my youth,&quot; he says. Mr. Mallya is unabashed in his desireto get rid of older employees, and is even consideringlowering the retirement age.   In 1986, Mr. Mallya assigned his new managers his ultimatedream: to expand even more than his father had beyond UB'straditional business of alcohol and beer, a &quot;mighty cashcow,&quot; he says, but a distinctly unholy one in India, wheredevout Hindus eschew alcohol.   While diversifying into electronics, petrochemicals,telecommunications and biotechnology, Mr. Mallya and his MBAsbegan a global hunt for acquisitions and partnerships. Toescape foreign-exchange and tax regulations in India, hedeclared himself a &quot;nonresident Indian&quot; in 1987, a statusthat limits to 179 each business year the number of days hecan be in India. He manages his interests from mansions insouthern India, Dubai and Surrey, and from his own BritishAerospace 125 jet.   The group's biggest planned investment is a $588 millionnaphtha cracker, plus $470 million in downstreampetrochemical projects. The group has set up atelecommunications joint venture with Atea N.V. of Belgium,which is majority-owned by Siemens AG of West Germany andL.M. Ericsson AB of Sweden. Pharmaceuticals operations,including the joint venture with Hoechst, are being expanded,and a new joint venture with Pharmacia AB of Sweden will makehealth-care products.   For the year ended March 31, Mr. Mallya estimates 12billion rupees ($694.4 million at current rates) in netsales, five times what it was when he inherited the company.Only 23% of sales currently comes from liquor and beer. Heexpects an operating profit of 800 million rupees, with 38%of that contributed by the liquor and beer businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
