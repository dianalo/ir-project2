Normalrat brains were exposed to argon laser light (454-514.5 nm) deliveredthrough an intracerebral end-emitting (bare-tipped) or a diffusion-emitting(sapphire-tipped) optical fiber probe. Interstitial thermistor probesrecorded temperatures after thermal equilibration at varying distancesfrom the emitting source. The end-emitting fiber produced significantly(P less than 0.05) higher elevations in tissue temperature than the diffusion-emittingfiber at the same laser power output. This is due to the smaller surfacearea (1.2 mm2 versus 7.8 mm2) of the end-emitting fiber, which resultsin a greater rate of energy delivery to tissue adjacent to the fibertip. Changes in intracerebral temperature measurements were also recordedat similar distances from a diffusion-emitting fiber at a continuoustotal laser power output of 150 mW for light wavelengths of 454-514.5nm, 700 nm, and 750 nm and at a total laser output of 1.1 W for 1,060nm. Variations in brain tissue temperature with distance from the laseremission source were compared for each laser group with the tissue temperatureprofile generated by a radiofrequency (wavelength 600-625 m) interstitialprobe. Similar temperature changes were found for all visible wavelengthsnear the probe, suggesting that the thermal response of brain adjacentto an interstitial laser fiber is primarily dependent upon the rate ofenergy delivery and not upon wavelength. The thermal profile versus distancefrom the light source depends mostly upon the level of temperature risenear the interstitial laser fiber tip and not the wavelength of laserlight used. These results have important implications in interstitialapplications of laser for hyperthermia and photochemotherapy.</TEXT></DOC>
