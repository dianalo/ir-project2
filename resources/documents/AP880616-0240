(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bargainers for the United Auto Workers andGeneral Dynamics Corp.'s Land Systems Division reached a three-yearcontract settlement late Wednesday night, averting a midnightstrike at the defense contractor.   The two sides put the finishing touches on a settlement covering6,000 workers that includes a drug testing program UAW VicePresident Marc Stepp said would be mutually satisfying to the unionand the company.   Details of the tentative agreement were not immediatelyreleased, although Stepp said it included a substantial payincrease and a ratification bonus, along with improvements inhealth and safety provisions.   ``Overall we were very happy,'' Stepp told a late night newsconference. ``We dealt with the substance abuse matter. Our memberswill agree to that I'm quite sure.''   Stepp said the contract would be explained to the workersrepresented by the UAW at the Land Systems Division, a tank-makingoperation that General Dynamics bought from Chrysler Corp. in 1982.The division has plants in the Detroit suburbs of Sterling Heightsand Warren and at Scranton, Pa., and Lima, Ohio.   About 1,000 of the division's workers are on layoff.   A ratification vote will take place in another seven to 10 days,the union said.   The union had sought a 3 percent-per-year increase in the$13-an-hour base wage at General Dynamics and increased unionrepresentation to help workers with benefit questions, Stepp said.   Stepp said the company sought to reduce the number of jobclassifications, or strict definitions of individual jobs, and moreflexibility in its use of workers.   Stepp said earlier that drug abuse was not a widespread problemin General Dynamics plants.   General Dynamics and the union have a pilot Employee AssistanceProgram at the Detroit Tank Plant in Warren. Like similar programsat General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler, theprofessionally administered program uses counseling and educationto help workers with drug and other problems.   Stepp said the union wants the EAP expanded to other LandSystems Division plants.   General Dynamics was required to accept Chrysler's UAW contractwhen it purchased the Land Systems Division, and a contractnegotiated in 1985 closely resembled Big Three auto contracts.   Talks on a new three-year contract began April 11, Stepp said.</TEXT></DOC>
