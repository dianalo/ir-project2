The energy company said its partnerships formed under the PaineWebber/Geodyne Energy Income Program I, and its Houston-based joint-venture partner, Primary Fuels Inc., will buy the wells, located in Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama. The Geodyne partnerships' share of the costs of the purchase is about $20 million and Primary Fuels is paying $10 million. PS Oklahoma, based here, is a subsidiary of Central andamp; South West Corp., a Dallas utility holding company.    Geodyne said it expects to complete the purchase by June 15. Steven A. Curlee, Geodyne's corporate counsel, said, &quot;We think they are a good acquisition and more economic than doing exploratory drilling.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
