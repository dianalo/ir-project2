The temperature is 29 degrees Fahrenheit. My toes curl and clench with cold. My fingers go numb. I shiver wildly.    &quot;Try to stop,&quot; says a voice through a small hole in the foam and steel wall. The technician worries that I will shake loose the temperature sensors on my skin. I go rigid, then try to relax. Neither method works. I stare at the two overhead fans blowing cold air and wonder when my 30-minute session in the &quot;cold box&quot; will end.    It could be worse. Here in the basement of the University of Minnesota-Duluth medical school, some students stand for hours in tanks full of ice water; outside, others are paid to jump into frigid Lake Superior and turn themselves into &quot;human ice cubes.&quot; These are the sorts of things they do here at the Hypothermia Research Laboratory, which operates under the watchful eye of Robert S. Pozos, the head of the medical school's physiology department.    It is only appropriate that the laboratory -- one of the few cold-weather research centers in the world -- is in Duluth, a city whose name is synonymous with cold. Snow often clings to Duluth's hills well into June. To fight winter's numbness, men race cars on the frozen lake top and women become &quot;hockey moms.&quot; Concedes Robert Dromeshauser, the lab's chief technician: &quot;You've got to be a little wacky to live up here.&quot;    You also have to be a little wacky to participate in Mr. Pozos's experiments. Hypothermia is dangerous. When the body's internal temperature falls below normal, it shuts off blood flow and heat to the extremities, which is why hands and feet are the first casualties of frostbite. Even a few degrees' drop in body temperature can trigger intense pain, disorientation and bizarre behavior. People dying from exposure in the wilderness sometimes take off all their clothes. No one knows why.    &quot;You literally can freeze to death within 20 to 30 minutes,&quot; says Mr. Pozos, a Southern Californian who moved here 15 years ago partly because his wife likes the climate.    Human vulnerability to cold remains largely a mystery. Hypothermia research didn't begin in earnest until the Cold War, when the military, worried about cold-weather combat, started financing studies. Now Mr. Pozos's lab tests survival suits for helicopter aviators and North Sea oil workers, tells the Navy how to handle hypothermia victims and sometimes gives prospective Arctic dog-sledders and English Channel swimmers a taste of what they face. The lab is also studying the chilling possibilities of &quot;nuclear winter.&quot; And for the Coast Guard this spring, Mr. Pozos will ply medical students with alcohol and see how well they navigate boats.    But most subjects don't get the alcohol or the boat. Take David Israel, a 26-year-old graduate student in physiology. Last October, for the standard $100 fee, he jumped into Lake Superior wearing only his street clothes. He concedes it was crazy. He also concedes that it wasn't his first time.    &quot;Every time I do it, I think there's no way I'm going to do it again -- no matter how much they pay me,&quot; he says.    In Mr. Israel's test, the Coast Guard wanted to learn how a typical boating-accident victim would fare. His reaction wasn't reassuring. &quot;His core temperature fell like a rock,&quot; says Mr. Pozos, who monitored the test aboard a nearby boat. Human-testing criteria require that when a subject's core temperature drops to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, the experiment be stopped. Mr. Israel was pulled out after 35 minutes, even though he says the pain hit almost immediately.    &quot;At first I thought, 'No way I'm going to stay in.' But eventually you go numb,&quot; he says. For the record, Mr. Israel, a wiry athletic type, says he enjoys camping in 30-below weather.    Some subjects are luckier. Jay Butcher, a second-year medical student, was assigned three hours in a tank of ice water, but he got to wear a helicopter pilot's survival suit. Still, he says, it wasn't pleasant: &quot;My muscles cramped. I couldn't move.&quot; He says he took the plunge for Pampers. &quot;My wife was expecting,&quot; he explains.    Some of the researchers' findings have been surprising. Senility in some old people may be caused by the cold -- what Mr. Pozos calls &quot;urban hypothermia.&quot; He thinks cold rooms sap their body heat and induce memory loss. He also believes that homeless people who seem intoxicated may just be cold.    Fat people generally fare better in the cold, his research shows. So do easy-going people. But dramatic mood swings and personality changes are common. He says that some people, after emerging from the cold tank, act dizzy or drunk. The brain seems particularly vulnerable to extreme cold. &quot;It's like all of a sudden pulling one or two boards from a computer,&quot; he says.    The researchers say that one of the best ways to get a buzz is to leave a stuffy cocktail party for a breath of brisk air. The cold increases blood circulation, rushing alcohol to the brain. Alcohol and similar drugs also blunt the skin's temperature receptors and can shut off the shivering mechanism. &quot;They give the body a false sense of warmth,&quot; Mr. Pozos says.    Shivering is important. It heats the skin and at the same time physically warns you to find heat. (Goose bumps are a vestige of primitive man, when body hair rose and trapped a layer of air.) Strangely, about 10% of the population doesn't shiver. Lab staffers here call such people &quot;lizards.&quot; Others are allergic to cold; one woman's hand puffed up for three days after being submerged in the laboratory's cold water.    As a specialist in shivering, Mr. Pozos is a popular speaker in northern Minnesota and occasionally testifies at trials. In a celebrated murder case here recently, he challenged the defendant's tale of spending hours in Lake Superior, valiantly trying to push his wife toward shore. Mr. Pozos said the man, who was convicted of faking a boating accident, would have died long before his wife.    And while prolonged exposure to cold air or water can be fatal -- most victims of the Titanic died of hypothermia -- brief encounters may actually be beneficial. Mr. Pozos notes that Scandinavians have been running out of saunas and plunging into icy water for years. &quot;If it hadn't been good for them,&quot; he says, &quot;they'd all be dead.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
