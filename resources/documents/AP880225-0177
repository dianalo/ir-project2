The Rev. Norman MacLaren, who has headed Swaggart's Canadianoperation since 1983, said he was planning a new building for his200-member congregation in Niagara Falls 10 months ago and decidedto make it large enough to serve also as the Canadian headquartersfor Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.   A foundation has been laid for the building, which will includea 1,300-seat sanctuary. The building is expected to be finished byNov. 30.   MacLaren said his church is a member of the PentecostalAssemblies of Canada, which is affiliated with the Assemblies ofGod denomination of which Swaggart is a member.   Asked if the TV evangelist's temporary absence from the pulpitand othe4r disciplinary action by the denomination will affect thelocal plans, MacLaren said ``we trust it won't.''   Between 35,000 and 40,000 Canadians subscribe to Swaggart'sevangelical magazine, he said. This is the group that will beserved by the headquarters in Niagara Falls.   Being the Swaggart headquarters means handling all Canadiandistribution of the evangelist's music, TV tapes and literature andprocessing all incoming mail, MacLaren said.</TEXT></DOC>
