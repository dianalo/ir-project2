Relations between the two countries soured in May 1987 after anIranian envoy was arrested on shoplifting charges in Manchester,northern England, and a British diplomat was assaulted by militantsin Tehran.   The Foreign Office announced the resumption of ties Thursdayfollowing talks in Vienna between Sir David Myers, assistantundersecretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, and Dr. MahmoudVaezi, director general of Iran's Foreign Ministry.   Mohammad Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires in Britain and the soleIranian diplomat here during the breakdown in ties, hinted that thethaw between the two nations could speed the release of threeBritish hostages in Lebanon.   Speaking in a radio interview with the British BroadcastingCorp., Basti said the hostage issue had not come up in negotiations.But he added: ``If you are trying to imply that the new relationshipbetween Iran and Britain may contribute to that end, I'm not goingto deny that.''   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, whose envoy Terry Waitedisappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to negotiatefreedom for two American hostages, said:   ``Certainly this cannot do any harm. We must wait and see. Thisis welcome news. After all the purpose of this diplomacy is to makeit easy for governments to talk to each other.''   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told the BBC there was ``nobargain or secret agenda.'' But he said the thaw in relationsenabled Britain ``more effectively to press the case at everyopportunity for the Iranians to use all the influence they have gotto secure the release of hostages.''   ``Whether that will produce an improvement in the position of thehostages I cannot say,'' Howe said. ``I don't want to raise falsehopes.''   In June 1987, Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran, closedIran's consulate in Manchester and cut its London embassy staff toone.   Three months later, an Iranian attack on a British tanker in thePersian Gulf prompted Britain to close the London office from whichIran was running a worldwide arms-purchasing operation for its waragainst Iraq.   A Foreign Office statement Thursday said Iran and Britain haddecided to resume full diplomatic representation ``with immediateeffect based on reciprocity, mutual respect and non-interference ineach others' affairs.''   A diplomatic source in London, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in eachcountry to assume posts over the next several months.   He said an application had been made to Iranian authorities for avisa for Gordon Pirie, a 51-year-old diplomat, who would becomeBritain's temporary charge d'affaires.   Howe said Britain would have a charge d'affaires in Iran within afew weeks, and an exchange of ambassadors ``within hopefully sixmonths of that.''   British officials said the Manchester consulate could resumeactivity but would not regain extraterritorial status, and the armsprocurement office would remain shut.   Fourteen foreigners _ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishmanand an Italian _ are missing in Lebanon.   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted in March1985.   Northern Ireland teacher Brian Keenan, who holds both British andIrish nationality, disappeared in Beirut April 11, 1986, and Britishtelevision journalist John McCarthy disappeared six days later.   A Palestinian terrorist group claimed to have executed AlecCollett, 64, a New York-based British journalist who was kidnappedMarch 25, 1985, but his body was not found.</TEXT></DOC>
