Bush will seek to put his personal stamp on the platform Mondaywhen he journeys to New Orleans to testify before the platformwriters a week before the opening of the Republican NationalConvention.   He has signaled that he wants this platform to echo most of thepositions the party took in 1984, when Republicans in Dallascategorically rejected any tax increases, endorsed a line-item vetoand balanced budget amendment, eschewed an Equal Rights Amendmentand promised to appoint judges at all levels ``who respecttraditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.''   The Democrats approved a 5,200-word platform at their conventionlast month after rejecting minority planks calling for higher taxeson corporations and the wealthy and for a pledge not to be thefirst to use nuclear weapons.   President Reagan has accused the Democrats of trying to hidetheir liberal positions in ``a plain brown-wrapper platform'' thatskirts any mention of how to pay for the ideas the Democratssupport.   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the Republican party chairman, said in atelephone interview from his Lake Tahoe, Nev., home, ``I do not seeat this point in time any major platform fights shaping up.''   Calling the platform ``the soul of the party,'' Fahrenkopfpromised, ``we intend to be specific on the issues and not to tryto mislead the American people with a piece of puff.''   New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, a close Bush adviser andplatform committee member, said the Republicans need to updatetheir plank on arms control, and give added emphasis to such issuesas education, the environment and child care.   Charles Black, the Bush campaign's platform liaison, said, ``Thevice president and the leadership of the platform committee are inagreement that we ought to use the '84 platform as a guidingdocument, update it, but keep most of the principles in it.''   ``AIDS wasn't even in there in '84,'' said Black, who added thathe expects the Republicans will have more to say this time aboutthe war on drugs.   By testifying in person, Bush is sending a message that ``unlike(Michael) Dukakis, who's ducking the issues, we are running on theissues,'' Black said.   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr is chairman of the 106-member platformcommittee, or the Committee on Resolutions as it is known inofficial GOP convention parlance. Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin andRep. Jerry Lewis of California are co-chairmen and New JerseyAssembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick is vice-chairman.   Donald J. Devine, head of an ad hoc conservative coalitioncalled the Committee to Save the Reagan Platform, said,``Everything seems to be going in the direction that we want.''   He predicted the platform will strongly support the StrategicDefense Initiative and the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, and take ahard line against abortion.   Devine said writing the plank on AIDS ``might be a problem, notideologically but just the complexity of the subject.''   But ``as far as we're concerned, things seem to be going ontrack,'' said Devine. ``If there's any trouble, it will probablycome from the moderates' side, not the conservatives.''   There were no minority planks at either the 1980 or 1984 GOPconventions that nominated Reagan and Bush.   In 1984, a handful of liberal Republicans on the platformcommittee, led by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut, wereunable to muster the 27 committee votes needed to press floorfights on such issues as the Equal Rights Amendment. Weicker is onthe platform committee again this year.   A New Jersey congressman, James Courter, said he will press foradoption of a civil rights plank committing the GOP to ``end racialdiscrimination wherever it exists.''   Courter wants to see a landmark 1976 civil rights case, RunyonV. McCrary, transformed into law. The Supreme Court recentlystirred a controvery when it voted 5-4 to reconsider that case,which guaranteed the right of minorities to sue over discriminationin housing, jobs and other areas.   The Republican platform writers will get a staff-produceddistillation of views that committee leaders heard at hearings inWashington, Kansas City, Mo., and Los Angeles over the past 4{months.   But that is ``merely giving them a piece of paper to workfrom,'' not a proposed draft like the Ted Sorensen-written documentthat the Democrats worked from, said Barbara I. Pardue, the presssecretary for the GOP convention.   The committee will vote on a proposed platform by Friday, orSaturday if necessary, then formally approve it Monday after theconvention opens and submit it to an up-or-down vote by the entireconvention Tuesday.   Each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico places oneman and one woman on the committee; Guam and the Virgin Islandssend single representatives.   Fahrenkopf, whose party produced a 32,000-word platform in 1984,said there is ``no way'' the Republicans will produce a document asshort as the Democrats'.   But he added, ``I would hope that we can say it shorter than32,000 words.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
