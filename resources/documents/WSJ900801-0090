One experiment cleared by the panel will enable NIHdoctors to implant genes designed to enhance the body'sability to fight metastatic melanoma, a fatal skin cancer.The second experiment will test the use of gene implants totreat ADA deficiency, a rare and congenital immune-systemdefect.</LP><TEXT>   In recent years, scientists have traced a number ofinherited disorders, such as ADA deficiency, hemophilia andcystic fibrosis, to specific malfunctions by genes, whichinstruct cells to perform various tasks. At the same time,researchers are concluding that diseases such as cancer,diabetes, heart disease and some manic-depressive illnessespartly result from genetic malfunctions. Thus, scientistshave begun to focus on therapies to replace missing genes orto enhance the performance of existing genes as a possiblekey to treating many diseases and disorders.   Scientists believe that gene therapy will eventuallygraduate from the laboratory to medical practice and emergeas a common method of treating a wide range of diseases anddisorders. &quot;In the next 20 years, we may be able to treatsome of the more common genetic diseases with gene therapy,&quot;predicted Robert Murray of the division of medical geneticsat Howard University in Washington. He said there would bestrong medical and commercial benefits in developing a genetherapy for fairly widespread genetic defects, such assickle-cell anemia, which afflicts about 50,000 Americanblacks. He also said the gene therapy eventually may treatcertain types of high blood pressure.   Yesterday's approvals move gene therapy &quot;from abstractscience to research and patient care,&quot; said Gerard McGarrity,chairman of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the NIHpanel that cleared the tests. &quot;The field of medicine has beenlooking for this kind of therapy for a thousand years,&quot; hesaid, calling the panel's votes &quot;an historic moment.&quot;   &quot;Unfortunately, we don't know exactly what theramifications are,&quot; warned Mr. McGarrity, who is thepresident of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research inCamden, N.J. &quot;Nobody can say where this is going in thefuture or how many applications we'll see.&quot;   Scientists don't know for sure how -- or even whether --human gene implants will work, much less the risks of tryingto fine-tune the body's genetic mechanism. Moreover, genetherapy has attracted criticism from groups that worry itcould lead to pressure to tinker with genetic structures inorder to improve the human race.   For these reasons, the NIH has put the proposals through arigorous review process. The Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee, a group of scientists, ethicists and lawyers, isthe last major hurdle. The Food and Drug Administration andthe acting director of NIH must still sign off on theproposed experiments, but their approval is considered acertainty.   In both experiments, scientists will remove immune-systemcells from patients and grow large amounts of these cells,called lymphocytes, in the laboratory. Then they will splicespecific genes into the cells and infuse them into thepatient. The cancer therapy will add a gene fortumor-necrosis factor (TNF), a protein that destroys tumorcells. The ADA therapy will add a gene responsible for theenzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). Victims of the disorderlack ADA, which is responsible for clearing wastes from thebody.   The tests will start in the fall on small numbers of NIHpatients who consent to take part in the experiments, whichdraw heavily on gene-implant research done by French Andersonof NIH's Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. It may be some timebefore scientists know how safe the therapies are and howwell they work.   The advisory panel authorized Dr. Anderson and two NIHcolleagues, Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver, to start theADA therapy on as many as 10 children. The review process,which took almost a year, was complicated by the fact thatall the test subjects will be children. In addition, thereare already two therapies available for patients with ADAdeficiency: bone marrow transplants, which only work for aminority of the fewer than 10 children born each year in theU.S. with the disorder; and the drug PEG-ADA, a treatmentdeveloped about five years ago that improves immune responsein most patients. The researchers will administer the ADAgene therapy along with PEG-ADA.   Even though ADA deficiency is rare, it received widepublicity several years ago from television reports of aTexas boy who had to live in a plastic bubble to protect himfrom infection and who subsequently died. Most victims of ADAdeficiency die from respiratory diseases in their youth.   The panel authorized Steven Rosenberg of the NationalCancer Institute to test the safety of TNF therapy on as manyas 50 volunteers. In an unusual move, the panel approved Dr.Rosenberg's proposal the first time he presented it. Membersof the panel said the quick approval came because Dr.Rosenberg is dealing with terminally ill patients for whomthere is no therapy. In addition, Dr. Rosenberg, who has woncommittee approval for two other experimental cancertherapies, did an effective job of using new data from testswith monkeys to address safety concerns.   Monday, Dr. Rosenberg told the panel's Human Gene TherapySubcommittee that TNF has &quot;almost been miraculous in what itcan do&quot; in reducing tumors in mice. &quot;Within 15 to 30 minuteswe can see necrosis and the dissolution of tumors.&quot; However,he said that &quot;TNF administration to humans has been anabysmal failure&quot; when attempted in a solution injectedintravenously.   Now Dr. Rosenberg will insert TNF into tumor-infiltratinglymphocytes, especially grown and strengthened cells that aredesigned to zero in on cancers in the body. He hopes that thecombination will produce a promising therapy.   When administered in some earlier applications, TNF hascaused the body to begin wasting away. Dr. Rosenberg hopesthat the more targeted application will be less risky. Thepoint of his initial tests will be to test the humantolerance and safety of TNF gene therapy when administered inconnection with interleukin-2, a protein made by Cetus Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
