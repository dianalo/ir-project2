The company added that Eddie Antar, 39 years old, relinquished the title of president but will remain chairman and chief executive officer.    The consumer electronics chain also said its board approved a program to make periodic open market purchases of as many as three million common shares, or about about 10% of its 31.2 million shares outstanding.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Crazy Eddie closed at $11.875, up 37.5 cents. The stock had traded as high as $21.625 in the past year, adjusted for stock splits, but it has fallen amid investor concern about increased competition.    The office of the president will consist of Mr. Antar's brother, Mitchell Antar, 30, who is executive vice president, marketing; Sam E. Antar, 29, who is executive vice president and chief financial officer and a cousin of Eddie Antar; and Isaac Kairey, 35, who was named to the new post of executive vice president, operations. Mr. Kairey had been director of retail operations.    The company also named Solomon E. Antar to the new post of senior vice president. He remains secretary and general counsel. David V. Panoff, formerly a vice president, was appointed to the new post of senior vice president of consumer service operations and telemarketing.    Edmond Levy, head of real estate and development, and Steve Pasquariello, head of store operations, were both named vice presidents of the company.    Messrs. Kairey, Panoff, Levy and Pasquariello and Sam and Solomon Antar were also named directors, increasing board membership to 11. </TEXT></DOC>
