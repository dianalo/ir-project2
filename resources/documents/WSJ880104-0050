But the firm, which claimed the top spot for the fifth year in a row, dropped in both market share and volume in several critical areas. Some of the firm's main rivals, meanwhile, moved up in market share, holding out the prospect that one of them could this year manage to topple Salomon from its throne.    Salomon's chief rival, First Boston Corp., also dropped in market share, though not as far. But the next three firms in the rankings --Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. --all moved up in market share. As a result, the five top-ranked firms are much more tightly bunched than they've been in some years, with a market share difference of just over four percentage points between the top firm and the fifth.    Many of the top firms saw their underwriting volume drop last year, largely because U.S. issuers raised less money, both here and abroad, than they did in 1986. Total underwriting volume for 1987 totaled just $281.9 billion, down 11% from the previous year's record $318.4 billion.    Salomon last year raised just $40.8 billion, down 24% from the previous year's $53.6 billion. Second-place First Boston, too, saw its overall volume sag, to $37.6 billion from 1986's $47 billion. And Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s volume dropped by close to a third, to $21.2 billion from $30.4 billion in 1986, but it held onto its sixth-place ranking.    Indeed, only three of the 10 top-ranked firms managed to increase their volume. Merrill Lynch, which placed fourth in 1986, moved up to third place last year with a $400 million volume gain. Seventh-place Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. nudged its volume up by $100 million, and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., 10th in 1986, moved up to ninth place last year with a $1.2 billion volume increase.    Salomon, whose strength has always been in debt issues, and especially in mortgage-backed debt, held onto leadership in both areas. But its market share shrank --significantly in the case of mortgage-backed debt, one of the few areas to increase in volume last year. In 1986, Salomon managed $18.8 billion of mortgage-backed debt for U.S. issuers, here and abroad. That amounted to 30% of the year's $63.9 billion volume.    Last year, however, the firm managed only $16.8 billion, which was just 20.3% of the year's total volume of $83 billion. The firms benefiting from Salomon's slide weren't its closest rivals, First Boston and Merrill Lynch --both of those firms also lost market share. Instead, some lower-ranked firms made sharp gains. Goldman Sachs managed $8.6 billion of mortgage-backed issues, putting it in fourth place with a 10.4% market share; in 1986, the firm ranked sixth, with $3.5 billion of issues and 5.6% of the market. Other firms with substantial market-share gains included Morgan Stanley, Drexel Burnham and Bear Stearns and Co.    Drexel Burnham continued its dominance in the junk bond area, but there, too, other firms increased their role. The next four firms in the ranking --Morgan Stanley, First Boston, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs --all increased both their volume and their market share. Salomon, meanwhile, dropped from third to sixth.    In a sharp drop in market share, First Boston managed only 43% of last year's asset-backed debt issues. In 1986, the firm managed 90.4%. Among the firms beginning to take a major role in that market were Salomon (with 27%), Shearson Lehman (with 12%) and Goldman Sachs (with 9%).    Salomon retained its strength among finance company clients, one of the few industries whose participants actually raised more money last year than the year before. But among industrial issuers --once a strong area for Salomon --the firm's business dropped substantially last year. Salomon came in sixth, with an 8% market share; in 1986 the firm was second only to Drexel Burnham (also last year's leader) with a 12% market share.    The initial public offering area --always a volatile one where underwriting rankings are concerned --reflected both underwriters' and investors' enthusiasm for mutual funds. Wheat, First Securities Inc., 1986's 16th-ranking firm, took first place last year after managing $2.5 billion of offerings, all for funds.    Indeed, a phenomenon that increased substantially, despite last year's overall volume drop, was underwriters' success at selling enormous issues, both debt and equity, that aren't backed by any kind of conventional corporate issuer. On the equity side, a full dozen of last year's biggest 30 issues were funds of one sort or another, three of them bigger than $1 billion.    On the debt side, the number of asset-backed issues also jumped, from a dozen in 1986 to at least 17 last year. Many of these were issued by subsidiaries of the underwriters themselves, backed by assets they'd bought in the open market, and all were issued by shell trusts or companies whose only business is to hold the assets backing the debt issues. Some of those issues, too, were huge, with four of them coming in at over $1 billion.    Although last year's rankings include issues done after the Oct. 19 stock market crash, the sudden falloff in volume after the crash didn't affect the rankings much --with one exception. Goldman Sachs, fifth for the year, came in first when post-crash volume alone is considered.    That's probably an honor the firm would rather have done without. Its post-crash volume consisted largely of issues that were badly hurt by the change in environment. The firm's $1.5 billion Southland Corp. issue had to be restructured after the crash.    When offerings for non-U.S. issuers are included, Goldman's post-crash lead is even greater, but that's because of another troubled issue. The $2.5 billion U.S. portion of British Petroleum's mammoth issue, priced before the crash, was sold after it --to lead-manager Goldman's distress and considerable financial loss.    ---            Leading Underwriters for U.S. Issuers                  (In billions of dollars)                                 DEBT AND PREFERRED STOCK                              ------------------------------    LEAD        TOTAL COMMON  MORTGAGE-  ASSET-  JUNK   MANAGER     AMOUNT  STOCK   BACKED   BACKED  BONDS OTHER* Salomon    Brothers   $40.8   $1.8     $17.3    $3.1  $ 1.2  $17.4 First Boston   37.6    2.2      12.1     5.1    4.0   14.2 Merrill Lynch  31.8    4.1       9.6     0.2    3.4   14.5 Morgan Stanley 31.8    2.2       7.1     ---    4.4   18.1 Goldman Sachs  29.2    3.3       8.8     1.0    2.0   14.1 Drexel Burnham 21.2    2.4       4.1     0.5   11.6    2.6 Shearson    Lehman      20.0    2.5       5.9     1.4    0.3    9.9 Kidder Peabody 10.0    1.4       4.4     0.2    0.5    3.5 Prudential-    Bache        5.7    1.1       2.4     ---    0.1    2.1 Bear Stearns    5.6    0.3       3.5     ---    0.1    1.7    *Includes below-investment grade convertible debt    Source: IDD Information Services</TEXT></DOC>
