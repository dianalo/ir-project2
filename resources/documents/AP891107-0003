Such rituals of rural campaigning in this sleepy town of 25,000are partly the result of the violence that prompted King Hussein tocall the first nationwide elections in 22 years.   There were few visible reminders of April's riots, just theoccasional scar on the street where tires were set alight duringunrest that left 10 people dead nationwide.   The talk in Maan, 120 miles south of Amman, was aboutWednesday's elections and little else as local men met to chat withtheir friends in diwans, gatherings often held beneath goat's hairtents.   Old men wearing red-and-white headdresses and younger ones inWestern-style suits sat under one tent on a dusty lot beside Arar'shouse sipping tea and smoking Arabic water pipes.   Among them was a local notable, Sheik Turki Sabah Krayshan, whocalled the elections for the 80-seat parliament ``a new page in ourhistory, a new lease of life for our country.''   He said Arar, a former interior minister who most people in Maancall Abu Mohammed, ``will listen to the people, and he will presenttheir requests to the parliament.''   The new parliament must approve all laws and budgets and it caneven override the king's veto. It can also toss out the royallyappointed Cabinet, a right spirited lawmakers exercised severaltimes in the past.   But Hussein remains the center of power, and he has the power todissolve parliament and rule without it, as he has done for most ofthe past 15 years.   A young man who helped slice the camel into chunks for thebanquet said ``it's a special treat, and we'll be killing a lotmore camels after Abu Mohammed wins the election.''   Twenty-eight candidates are competing for five seats in thesprawling Maan governorate. Another 13 are vying for two ruralseats reserved for southern Bedouin tribes.   The April violence in Maan was sparked by taxi drivers angry ata 25 percent increase in gasoline prices. But most of the rioterswere young men frustrated by rising prices and a lack of jobs.   At one diwan, a young man told a visiting reporter that ``thegovernment must do something about unemployment and about publicservices here, which are not as good as in Amman.''   But older tribesmen quickly urged him to quiet down.   Turki denied that there was a gap between older leaders known as``the sheiks'' and a younger generation of often better-educatedJordanians trying to break away from tribal influence.   ``There are differences between the old people and the young,''he acknowledged. ``But they're very slight. All the youth are withthe sheiks.''   But columnist Mariam Shahin wrote in the Jordan Times daily thatthe influence of the sheiks appears to be eroding in some districts.   She quoted one younger candidate as saying: ``Tribal leadershave had their chance. Look where it got them.   ``Our rural areas have been neglected as far as educational,economic, social and cultural development projects are concerned.So why should they be given another chance?''   In Maan, local journalist Mustafa Khoshman said tribalallegiances would be more potent in the elections than anypolitical stands by the candidates.   The Maan region has the largest area but the smallest populationof Jordan's governorates. Its 150,000 people are overwhelmingly ofBedouin stock and form the bedrock of Hussein's support.   The railroad that runs through Maan along the Islamic pilgrimageroute to Mecca was repeatedly attacked by T.E. Lawrence _ Lawrenceof Arabia _ during his campaign against the Turks alongsideHussein's ancestors during World War I.   The southern Bedouins of the Howeitat tribe were famous fortheir bravery in the battles that helped put Hussein's grandfather,King Abdullah, on the throne.   ``His majesty the king is very popular here,'' said Turki, whosaid Hussein was welcomed like a hero when he visited Maan afterthe riots.   ``He can come here any time. There will be no problems,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
