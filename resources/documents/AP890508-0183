(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Televison evangelist Jim Bakker relaunchedhis television ministry on Monday from a nearly deserted shoppingcenter on the outskirts of this central Florida city.   Bakker, his wife and co-host Tammy, and a handful of followerswasted no time to videotape a prayer of thanks for the ``miracle''of their new home, the little-used South Orlando Shoppers World.   ``Orlando seems like it's the crossroads of the world,'' Bakkertold reporters inside the vast, empty space filled with loose wiresand dangling pipes. ``The thing I like about it is it's a placewhere it seems like everyone is welcome.''   The only other tenants at the partially boarded-up, fadedshopping center are two bars and a Far East import store.   At one of the bars _ Nasty Ed's Pub _ the clientele squintedthrough windows to see their new neighbors.   Bakker, 49, is free on $50,000 bond while awaiting federal trialon 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He is charged with stealingmillions of dollars from PTL, the television ministry he founded.   Bakker was ousted from PTL in 1987 after revelations that he hada liaison with a church secretary and paid her with ministry moneyto keep her quiet.   American Shopping Centers Inc. owner Stuart Gilman, whosecompany controls the strip mall, said the Bakkers have leased adepartment store space and had the right to use the remainder ofother unleased space.   Neither Bakker nor Gilman gave further details of the lease.   The Bakkers said they rented a home nearby and hope toeventually buy the entire 90,000-square-foot shopping center. Theysaid they also hoped to buy between 2,000 and 10,000 acres in theregion for a religious theme park.   ``I believe there's great religious tolerance here,'' saidBakker.   A single protester at the shopping center, however, wanted nopart of it.   Frankie Skinner, 23, of Orlando, marched around the mallcarrying a sign that read: ``Just Say No. Keep Our City Clean.''   ``I think it's so wrong,'' Ms. Skinner said of the Bakkers' moveto Orlando. ``They shouldn't get another chance.''   The move is the latest development in the Bakkers' odyssey tofind a new home for their embattled television ministry.   The Bakkers spent the last five weeks at the Lake GeorgeMinistries Retreat, a 29-acre compound east of the north Floridatown of Ocala. From the camp, the Bakkers and about 25 cast andcrew members taped several installments of ``The Jim and TammyShow.''   During that time, the couple has been shopping for a permanantspot for their television ministry.   The Bakkers came to Florida after running into zoning problemswhile taping their program at a rented home near Charlotte, N.C.   The long-term goal, according to the Bakkers, is to bringcentral Florida something similar to Heritage USA, the sprawlingChristian theme park in Fort Mill, S.C.</TEXT></DOC>
