The paper-products and information-retrieval concern said first-quarter net rose to $34.2 million, or $1.09 a share, from $20.3 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier profit included earnings from continuing operations of $20.8 million, or 67 cents a share, and a $500,000 loss from discontinued insurance operations.    First-quarter sales rose 40%, to $957 million from $682.8 million.    The first-quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations. Most analysts estimated Mead would earn about $1 a share. Mead cited improved operations as well as strong market demand for its pulp and paperboard products, where most products are in a sold-out position through mid-year. The company said Mead Data Central, its electronic publishing business, showed strong growth across all markets during the period.    For all of 1987, &quot;the generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly improved earnings,&quot; said Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer. For 1986, Mead posted profit from continuing operations of $109.3 million, or $3.50 a share. A $65.9 million loss from discontinued operations and a $7.1 million extraordinary charge from the early retirement of debt made 1986 net $36.3 million, or $1.16 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
