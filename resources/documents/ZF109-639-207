(International MaritimeSatellite Organization)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Crockett, Barton.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT)launches the first of four satellites that will help support newcommunications services as well as more than quadruple INMARSAT'stransmission capacity.andP;  The INMARSAT-2 series of satellites, whichare collectively valued at $610 million, will allow INMARSAT tosupport data communications services and mobile telephone servicesat speeds of up to 2.4Kbps.andP;  The four satellites will have morepower and greater capacity than the current INMARSAT systems whichis based on a variety of satellite capacity leased from differentsatellite organizations.andP;  The satellites will have capacity equalto about 250 simultaneous voice-grade analog circuits.andP;  Theexisting INMARSAT satellite system as a whole supports no morethan 200 analog voice circuits.andP;  The new satellites will also beamdown stronger signals enabling users to deploy smaller earthstations for services.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     International Maritime Satellite OrganizationData CommunicationsMobile Radio SystemsCommunications SatellitesCommunications Service Suppliers.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
