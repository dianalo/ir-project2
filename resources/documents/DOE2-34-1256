It proposes an original cement slurry formulation whichimproves the cementing of a borehole passing through salt formations,with respect to compressive strength, thickening time, rheology, freewater characteristics, compatibility with Mg salts and with the adjoiningnon-salt-containing formations, and bonding properties between cementand salt formation. The composition contains at the beginning only asmall quantity of salt (up to 18 wt% of NaCl with respect to the mixwater). In particular, this reduces the risk of an alkali silica reactionbetween the composition and the formations adjoining the salt stratum.The invention essentially resides in two points: a saturated sodium silicatesolution is added to the cement slurry, thus increasing the silica activity;and the setting time is controlled by a mixture of lignosulfonate witheither borax or citric acid. The addition of this solution to a mediumcomprising salt water results in the formation of a sodium silicate gelwhich decays under basic pH conditions. Consequently, this gel is notstable in a cement slurry, ensuring a good rheology which is not sensitiveto an increase in slurry salinity. The amount of sodium silicate in thesystem must be greater than a limit which may be fixed at about 35 l/tonof slurry, with an upper limit of about 150 l/ton. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
