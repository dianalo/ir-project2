(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors were preparing to tell abloody tale of restaurant rubouts, a ``contract'' to assassinatereputed mob boss John Gotti and Mafia control of construction as thetrial of six alleged organized crime figures opened today.   Jury selection began today, and opening arguments were scheduledto start next week. U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry grantedthe government's request for an anonymous jury _ a first for afederal trial in New Jersey _ because of the nature of the case.   The trial is expected to shed light on organized crime violencein the New York metropolitan area, and may help solve a string ofmob-related murders dating back 12 years.   It also will mark the courtroom debut of Vincent ``Fish'' Cafaroas a prosecution witness.   Cafaro is a former associate of jailed and aging former Genoveseboss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno. He testified last year beforeCongress about life in the mob and its activities.   Ms. Barry said the case ``makes no pretense of being other thanan organized crime case in which the inner workings of the Mafiawill be hammered home.''   The main defendants, indicted in June, are reputed Genovese``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader, Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59; hisdeputy, restaurant owner Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71; and Richard``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, termed an enforcer for the group. The threeare being held without bail.   They and the other defendants _ Rocco J. Napoli, 42, JohnDerrico, 27, and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, _ are charged withracketeering.   The racketeering charge includes allegations of controlling laborunions, extorting construction industry figures, trafficking instolen goods, loan sharking, illegal gambling, murder and murderconspiracy. All deny the charges and organized crime ties.   Much of the government's case rests on 2,500 hours of tapedconversations recorded in a back room of a Hoboken restaurant fromJune 1987 to March 1988.   Prosecutors said they will present evidence about a plot to killGotti, the flamboyant reputed boss of the Gambino crime family inNew York City. Authorities have said the Genovese family was angryabout Gambino incursions in northern New Jersey territory.</TEXT></DOC>
