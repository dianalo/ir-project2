Likea tornado sweeping through town, the drop wreaked someconcentrated damage in such areas as biotechnology.   But overall, analysts and money managers surveying thescene a week later -- during which the industrials fell anadditional 40 points -- are finding that the market's tumbleis more frightening than harmful.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It sure gets your attention,&quot; observes Laszlo Birinyi, anindependent market analyst. However, like many other analystshe has concluded that the plunge was a sudden but minorcorrection that isn't likely to cause much more damage.   For one thing, Mr. Birinyi notes that 10 of the 30 stocksin the industrial average are trading at about their levelsof last January, before the outbreak of fighting in thePersian Gulf sent the stock market rocketing. Those stocks,including Alcoa, Boeing, Caterpillar, International BusinessMachines and Procter andamp; Gamble, won't be subject to the kindof profit-taking that accentuated the Nov. 15 plunge as moneymanagers hastened to lock in their gains from a very goodyear.   &quot;Those stocks will provide a kind of floor for the Dow,&quot;Mr. Birinyi says.   What's more, the several Dow stocks that are upsubstantially from January's levels -- including GoodyearTire andamp; Rubber, Merck, Coca-Cola Co. and Du Pont -- &quot;all havegood stories and the fundamentals are there to justify thoseprices,&quot; Mr. Birinyi says.   &quot;I'm not jumping up and down for joy,&quot; he hastens to add,&quot;but there is life after a 100-point plunge.&quot;   Still, there are some potential problems ahead, he warns.The one that worries him most is the message that Washingtonis sending. Either politicians ignore the market and theeconomy, he says, or they overreact and do somethingdangerous.   &quot;People are worried about the economy and it doesn't helpfor the president to say, while he's lining up a putt, thatwe don't have to fix this problem because it doesn't exist,&quot;he says. &quot;That's a real concern for me.&quot;   Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist at KidderPeabody, is very optimistic overall. He thinks the Nov. 15drop was a temporary correction in a bull market.   &quot;We're going through a real tough period when confidencein the economy is waning,&quot; he concedes. &quot;But bull markets inequities do not come to an end in a burst of panic selling.And they do not come to an end with an accommodative postureon the part of the Federal Reserve Board.&quot;   As Mr. Abrams sees it, low interest rates will do a lot toget the economy perking again as consumers, corporations, andstate and local governments struggle either to reduce debtlevels built up in the 1980s or at least refinance them atlower rates. After that, a sustained period of moderateeconomic growth could go on for years, he says, providing asolid underpinning for continued stock market gains.   But he has pinpointed two potentially disruptive problemsthat he says investors &quot;should be damned concerned about,&quot;although he adds that it's too early to take any actions toavoid.   Like Mr. Birinyi, he worries about Washington. But he isconcerned less about lack of attention than about too muchmeddling by politicians. With a presidential election loomingless than a year away and the economy still moribund, Mr.Abrams fears political leaders will panic and go overboard intheir efforts to spark a recovery.   &quot;The temptation of the politicians to do something thatresults in overkill worries me a lot,&quot; he says, &quot;particularlyas I listen to the fatuous comments and wacky proposalscoming out of Washington. It keeps me awake at night.&quot;   The less critical problem is that sometime in 1992, as therecovery begins to catch hold, short-term interest ratescould start rising before corporate earnings show muchimprovement. This scenario could give investors another caseof the shakes.   &quot;At some point we'll shift from a period of fallingearnings and falling interest rates, in which rates are byfar the more powerful of the two factors, to a period ofrising earnings and rising rates,&quot; he says. &quot;If rates startto rise first, there might be some grinding of the gears aswe make that shift.&quot;   Abby Cohen, co-strategist at Goldman Sachs, also believesthat the sharp drop in stock prices a week ago was merely anintermission in the bull market.   &quot;What the market is going through now is transitory,&quot; shesays. &quot;While people have legitimate concerns that maybe therecovery has stalled, or that the Fed doesn't seem able tostimulate the economy, or that Washington might do somethingimpolitic, what ultimately will determine the direction ofstock prices is the direction of the economy and corporateprofits.&quot;   She argues that current evidence is that the economy hasslowed in recent weeks, but isn't declining. Patience is thekey, she says.   &quot;Ultimately, the Fed has a significant amount of power toget us out of this malaise,&quot; she says. &quot;The mistake is toassume that if the Fed eases today, the economy will respondtomorrow. The lags can be as much as six to 12 months.&quot;   With the economic rebound will come an increase incorporate profits. Indeed, Ms. Cohen says the averageprediction of market strategists that profits next year willclimb 10% to 12% &quot;is right in the ballpark or maybe even alittle low.&quot;   And longer term, she's convinced that households willshift much of their savings into the stock market, providinga tremendous amount of fuel to power a rise in stock prices.   Yet she, too, sees potential stumbling blocks. One of themis that while estimates of 1992 corporate profits bystrategists -- so-called &quot;top down&quot; estimates -- are right ontarget, the predictions of profits being made by analysts whostudy individual stocks -- &quot;bottom up&quot; estimates -- amount toa 30% increase in 1992 profits.   &quot;That doesn't pose a risk for the overall market,&quot; saysMs. Cohen, &quot;but it does mean that individual stocks orsectors could provide some big disappointments.&quot; That's onereason she recommends investors concentrate on big growthcompanies that are less likely to disappoint, such asBristol-Myers, Merck, Colgate-Palmolive, and even someforeign growth companies, such as Nestle.   Less likely, but much more devastating, she says, would bea complete failure of the economy to recover next year. &quot;Thereal issue in all this is the economy,&quot; she acknowledges. &quot;Ifit doesn't recover then we'll be wrong about profits, too.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The stock market ended a nervous week with anotherdecline, caused by computer sell programs and a lack ofbuying interest.
