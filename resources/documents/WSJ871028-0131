It put the hazards associated with asbestos in buildings into perspective by mentioning the fact that removal presents greater danger than taking prudent action to control the escape of respirable fibers into the ambient air. Unscrupulous operators who sell asbestos substitutes and fraudulent rip-out contractors are profiteering from the hysteria associated with this burgeoning industry.    That is not to say that asbestos isn't bad and that the major sellers have not been concealing the danger of their products for 50 years. Our tort system will exact justice on them, even though the meager recovery the victims' survivors obtain will be inadequate compensation.    There are two other vital points associated with asbestos-related diseases:    The threat of contracting mesothelioma, the vicious form of lung cancer that is always lethal, from inhalation of asbestos fibers is confined almost exclusively to smokers. If you don't smoke, asbestos inhalation isn't likely to give you lung cancer. If you do smoke, the probability that it will is very high.    There is a latency period of 25 to 40 years after the onset of exposure to asbestos before the dread mesothelioma appears. This factor alone has allowed most employers of asbestos-exposed workers to escape legal responsibility.    Smoking is the greater culprit in the asbestos fray.    William English   Oakton, Va.   ---   Asbestos causes lung cancer almost exclusively in damaged lungs and that damage is mostly caused by tobacco smoking. You did note that smoking is a greater risk than asbestos but you didn't provide the linkage. Well-documented evidence supports this and, in fact, tobacco companies have become co-defendants in many lawsuits against the asbestos industry.    E.P. Coughlin   Philadelphia   ---   Your editorial told it like it is, with one exception. Almost all lung cancers seen in asbestos workers have been among smokers. Asbestos is regarded as a promoter, not an initiator, of lung cancer. You imply, but didn't clearly state, that asbestos-related illness is dose-related. These facts are too often overlooked and bear directly on the minor problem of asbestos in buildings.    Roger S. Mitchell M.D.   Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado    School of Medicine   Denver   ---   The greatest threat posed by asbestos isn't its removal. It is, in fact, when asbestos-containing materials are disturbed by well-intentioned but uninformed contractors during construction activities. Once disturbed and airborne, asbestos fibers do pose a health hazard. Building owners and managers, who are aware of this potential danger, can retain a competent consultant or trained contractor to deal with this special health hazard. Qualified contractors can ensure safe, economical and professional asbestos abatement.    Michael C. Toll   Commodore Environmental Services   Chicago   ---   I've long held that the asbestos peril is vastly overrated, and I'll &quot;go to the mat&quot; to back up my opinion. How well I remember, back in the '20s, my mother cooking over a gas stove, as many homemakers did then. Routinely she reached for a flat, round asbestos mat to reduce the heat to &quot;simmer.&quot; That went on for years. When mats wore out, she bought replacements at the hardware store.    My parents suffered no lung problems, neither did they die young. And in spite of the contaminated air we breathed as children, my sister and I today are healthy and strong. Our lungs may be laced with hazardous fibers, but we are managing very well, thank you, without oxygen tanks.    Helen K. Cook   Kansas City, Mo.</TEXT></DOC>
