The amount of money they have at theirdisposal is extraordinary. It's beyond comprehension.''   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is on trial in U.S. District Court on chargesof evading federal taxes by disguising $4 million in renovations ather Connecticut mansion as business expenses. She also faces otherfraud and extortion charges.   Feffer downplayed the $1 million in federal taxes Mrs. Helmsleyis charged with not paying in 1983-85. He said Mrs. Helmsley and herhusband, Harry, paid $57.8 million in federal, state and local taxesduring that time.   Feffer told the jury that the businesses were entitled to paypart of the cost of renovating, decorating and operating the countryestate the Helmsleys purchased in 1983 for $11 million.   In his opening arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVitasaid the Helmsleys knew the write-offs were illegal.   ``The Helmsleys were determined to keep down the cost and chargeas much as they could get away with to their companies,'' he said.   ``They used their position in society to evade one of the mostimportant responsibilities ... to pay their fair and accurate shareof taxes.''   The Helmsleys head a $5 billion real-estate and hotel empire.   Helmsley, 80, who was indicted in April 1988 with his wife, wasremoved from the trial after U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.found him mentally incompetent.   DeVita said an outdoor sound system, a marble dance floor andjade figures worth half a million dollars were among the purchasesfor Dunnellen Hall in Greenwich, Conn., that Mrs. Helmsley wrote offas business expenses.   He said Mrs. Helmsley also used her hotels and businesses as ``apersonal piggy bank'' to pay for other purchases. He said theseincluded everything from a $45,000 silver clock for her husband``right down to her shoes and underwear.''   DeVita said Mrs. Helmsley yelled at employees and had them firedif they did not go along with the scheme.   One executive, who paid out $10,000 for work at the mansion aftergetting Helmsley's approval, was forced to personally pay back theamount to Mrs. Helmsley because she did not approve the contract,DeVita said.   Mrs. Helmsley, who appears in advertisements as the ``queen ofthe Helmsley Hotels,'' several times shook her head no duringDeVita's hour-long statement and her face became noticeably red.   The prosecutor charged that the Helmsleys avoided paying for therenovation of the estate by submitting phony invoices and records tomake it appear that the expenses were incurred by 19 differentcompanies in their empire.   He also said Helmsley and co-defendant Frank Turco, a formerHelmsley Hotel executive, extorted ``money, goods and services''from vendors doing business or seeking contracts with Helmsleycompanies.   He said the scheme unraveled in early 1986 after Turco and athird defendant, Joseph Licari, who was a top aide to Helmsley, fellout of favor with Mrs. Helmsley.   ``The henchmen were no longer there to keep a lid on it,'' DeVitasaid.</TEXT></DOC>
