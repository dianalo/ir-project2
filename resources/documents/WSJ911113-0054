How about whatAntonin Scalia dismissed as a &quot;junior-varsity Congress.&quot;Justice Scalia was the sole dissenter in the 1989 SupremeCourt case that upheld the constitutionality of a SentencingCommission made up of a mix of judges, sociologists andothers to dictate criminal penalties. He doubted that a groupoutside the three constitutional branches of government wouldoperate responsibly.   The Sentencing Commission this month proved Justice Scaliaright.</LP><TEXT>   Its new rules for criminal penalties for corporations,which went into effect Nov. 1, make this a Lawyer andProsecutor Employment Bill. Businesses and ultimatelyconsumers face bills for huge new fines and legal-defensecosts. Among the innovations is corporate Russian roulette:Federal judges are told in some cases to liquidate a businesseven if the offense was an unauthorized and unsupervisableact of a low-level employee.   The original idea behind the Sentencing Commission madesome sense. Over the past 30 years, federal judges handeddown unpredictable sentences, especially in street-crimecases such as drugs and violent crime. In 1984, Congressdecided that judges should have less discretion. Congressdelegated to a seven-person Sentencing Commission, three ofwhom are federal judges, the task of eliminating disparitiesand uncertainty among sentences. New rules for individualcrimes such as drug offenses went into effect in 1987.   Congress never instructed the Sentencing Commission tocreate new rules for punishing crimes that happen to becommitted by someone working for a corporation, nonprofit,union or other &quot;organization.&quot; For reasons known only to thecommissioners, the new rules for these sentences, whichmostly affect corporations, will increase both disparitiesand uncertainty.   Congress also never gave the Sentencing Commission theauthority to increase corporate sentences. The commissionersnever explained why they increased penalties, but admit thatthe average fine will double or maybe quadruple, up to alimit of $290 million. Fines that are now $50,000 couldeasily become $500,000.   Here's how it works. There are 32 &quot;offense levels,&quot; whichmeasure the heinousness of the offense based on factors suchas whether executives were involved and the amount of moneyat stake. An unintentional regulatory reporting &quot;crime&quot; thatcauses little or no apparent profit could lead to a hugepenalty if it happened to relate to a billion-dollarcontract, such as in defense procurement or a Treasuryauction. Yet a crime with evil intent -- say, defraudinggranny of her $10,000 savings account -- could result in lesspunishment because the amount involved was less.   Once a judge measures the offense level, a defendant canget a reduction based on a vague set of mitigating factors.One is if the firm has an &quot;effective compliance program.&quot;Whatever this means, it includes hiring more lawyers. EastmanKodak Co. filed papers warning the Sentencing Commission ofanother risk. &quot;U.S. corporations could soon come to resemblethe Soviet Army with a commissar assigned to each unitresponsible for reporting questionable behavior to theappropriate authorities.&quot; There also can be a probationperiod, which raises the specter of federal judges overseeingcorporations.   Former officials of the Sentencing Commission predictedother likely effects of the new rules at a recent CatoInstitute conference. Michael Block, who teaches law andeconomics at the University of Arizona, resigned as acommissioner in 1989 because he said the new penalties were&quot;arbitrary&quot; and made in an &quot;information-free&quot; setting. Hesaid the average fine will increase up to 20 times thecurrent levels.   John Lott, a Wharton professor and former chief economistfor the Sentencing Commission, told the Cato group, &quot;Themajority of commissioners believed that increasing penaltiesproduced only benefits and no costs. They did not want anyempirical work undertaken that might contradict thatconclusion.&quot; Too bad, because one reason the Supreme Courtupheld the Sentencing Commission was the assurance that itwould justify its actions in a way that could be reviewed.   Too bad also because punishments are different forcorporations than for, say, muggers. Mr. Lott and Universityof Washington economist Jonathan Karpoff pointed out thateffects on corporate reputations can dwarf the fine. Theysaid firms accused of fraud suffer a drop in stock value ofbetween $40 million and $60 million.   There is a more basic problem, which likely will be raisedas a constitutional defense by fined corporations. This isthat the very idea of &quot;corporate sentencing&quot; makes littlesense. Few other countries have a concept of criminal acts bycorporations, which cannot possess the evil intent requiredfor most crimes.   Ronald Coase, this year's economics Nobel winner, pointedout a related problem. He said that corporations are nothingmore or less than a web of contracts among owners(shareholders), chief employees (officers), other workers,suppliers, customers. When a corporation is fined, who pays?Not the CEO, general counsel, board of directors. Not thesupervisor or employee who directly committed the offense.The fine comes out of the corporation, which meansshareholders, which increasingly means pension funds, whichmeans you and me.   For a flavor of the Sentencing Commission's approach,consider this new instruction to federal judges: &quot;When anorganization exists principally to achieve a criminal purposeor operates primarily through criminal means, there is nolawful basis for its existence. It is therefore appropriateto terminate its existence by levying fines that would divestit of its assets.&quot; Prosecutors already use the RICO law oftento label manufacturers, brokers and traders asorganized-crime racketeers and &quot;continuing criminalenterprises.&quot; It's a safe prediction that judges will gobeyond Mafia fronts when they decide which firms must beliquidated.   The best explanation for these new penalties is ananti-markets vindictiveness in the air. The political andcriminal attack on junk bonds was the first sign ofretribution against the prosperous 1980s. Now we have bankersin dread fear that some 35-year-old regulator will declarethem insolvent. The credit crunch guarantees work only forbankruptcy lawyers.   The Sentencing Commission acted arbitrarily enough that itcreated new constitutional doubts about itself. JusticeScalia could get another chance to convince his colleaguesthat strict separation of powers explains why this group isunconstitutionally unaccountable.   In the meantime, the Bush administration has a problem.Defusing the litigation explosion could be its leadingeconomic-growth proposal, but the White House now sends amixed message. Dan Quayle's reforms target plaintiff lawyers,but George Bush's Justice Department supports the SentencingCommission and its harsh new penalties for corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
