The Salomon Inc. unit, together with the New Yorkinvestment firm of Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co. and Grand Unionmanagement, acquired the grocery business from financier SirJames Goldsmith in July 1989 in a $1.2 billion leveragedbuy-out. Salomon owns 42% of the stock; Miller Tabak Hirsh andamp;Co. owns about 41%, and management owns 17%.</LP><TEXT>   Although the recession has crimped many northeastsupermarket chains, Grand Union has increased its operatingcash flow 36% from $145 million at the time of the buy-out tonearly $200 million for the year ending March 1992.   Although Salomon Brothers has had the right to sell GrandUnion since last October, a major investor in the supermarketchain said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision andintends to bid aggressively for the grocery company.   &quot;We're definitely interested buyers,&quot; said Gary Hirsch,managing general partner in Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co., bestknown on Wall Street as a trader of stock index futures andother securities.   For the year ended March 1991, Grand Union reported a lossof $53.8 million compared with $14.9 million the prior year.Sales rose 7.3% to $2.92 billion from $2.72 billion.Operating cash rose 8.8% to $185 million from $170 million.The supermarket chain does business as Grand Union primarilyin the Northeast and as Big Star in the Atlanta region.   Mr. Hirsch noted that Salomon's decision to sell wasconsistent with Salomon's current strategy of reducing itsexposure to leveraged buy-outs and other illiquidinvestments. He emphasized that his relationship with Salomonremains cordial. Salomon officials declined to comment.   Mr. Hirsch is also chairman of GND Holdings Corp., theholding company which owns Grand Union. In addition to Mr.Hirsch, the GND Holdings board consists of four SalomonBrothers executives and Joseph J. McCaig, president and chiefexecutive officer of Grand Union. Although Mr. Hirsch opposedthe proposed sale, he was outvoted.   Salomon has about $155 million invested in Grand Union,including bank debt, notes, and equity. At the time of thebuyout, Salomon and its partners paid 8.4 times cash flow forGrand Union; it is believed that Salomon hopes to sell thecompany for 7.5 times cash flow, or about $1.45 billion to$1.5 billion.   According to those familiar with Grand Union, potentialbidders may include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New Yorkinvestment company, and Freeman Spogli andamp; Co., a merchantbanking company based in Los Angeles.   &quot;We certainly have an interest in the industry, we knowGrand Union well, and we would expect to look at it,&quot; saidBrad Freeman, a partner in Freeman Spogli.
