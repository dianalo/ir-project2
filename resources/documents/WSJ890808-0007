The maker of computer networking products blamed its disappointing sales in June and July upon general business conditions and upon the need to lower prices for some of its products. The company said that if it has strong sales in August, it should post earnings for the quarter ending Aug. 31; otherwise &quot;the possibility of a loss cannot be ruled out.&quot;    The company reported sales of $82 million in its year-earlier period. A spokesman for the company declined to specify revenue for the current quarter, saying only that the company has a policy of issuing a statement whenever its revenues fall at least 10 percent below the consensus of Wall Street estimates.    For its fourth quarter ended May 31, 3Com posted net of $8.2 million on sales of $11.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
