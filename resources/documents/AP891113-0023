Now it has some evidenceof success _ a lawsuit by the federal government.   The Bush administration seeks to overturn major portions ofOakland's 1988 nuclear-free initiative that could affect a Navybase, a Department of Energy office and other federal installations.   It was the first government lawsuit against any of the more than160 measures passed around the nation during the last decadedeclaring in varying terms that nuclear weapons were unwelcomewithin their jurisdictions.   Most of the measures are symbolic, either by design or bylocation in a place without nuclear connections. The trend inrecent years has been toward more specific and binding proposals,which have occasionally provoked opposition from potentiallyaffected local businesses.   In case involving the federal lawsuit, there is a good chancethe government will succeed at least partially.   At issue is an Oakland ordinance that can be interpreted asasserting local authority over a variety of decisions affectingnuclear weapons, an area in which courts have given the federalgovernment much power.   The provisions are broad and mandatory. It was passed in a cityof 350,000 that is home to a Navy supply center for the PacificFleet and a Department of Energy office that oversees nuclearweapons research at nearby Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Also,many other area military bases ship materials through Oakland.   Passed by voter initiative in November 1988, the measure:   _ Forbids all ``nuclear weapons work,'' including research,production or storage of weapons or their components, afterNovember 1990.   _ Requires any shipment of radioactive material through Oaklandto be disclosed in advance to the city, which would choose thesafest routes.   _ Prohibits the city from contracting with, or investing in, anynuclear weapons-makers, unless no reasonable alternatives exist.   The contracting and investment provisions, borrowed from theanti-apartheid movement, are the key to the measure, said WilsonRiles Jr., the only City Council member to support the initiativebefore it passed.   He said they already have led the city to reduce substantiallyits investments in federal treasury bills and offer a promisingmodel to other communities.   Riles said he believed the two provisions were on firm legalground, because similar bans on South African products have beenupheld in court.   ``Oakland is at a critical point in this new turn in the peacemovement,'' he said. ``The federal government has realized this andI think that's why they're trying to stop it.''   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the U.S. DostrictCourt lawsuit, filed in September on behalf of the Navy and EngeryDepartment, was intended to respond to a unique local problem, notto stop a movement or send a message to other jurisdictions.   The lawsuit contends the ordinance interferes with thegovernment's exclusive authority over national defense and nuclearenergy, creates undue burdens on interstate commerce, and conflictswith laws on military secrecy and shipments of hazardous materials.   So far, the city has tried to avoid, or at least minimize, anyconfrontation.   The City Council passed a resolution saying the investment bandid not apply to pensions, the restrictions on transportation didnot cover state or federal highways, and the disclosurerequirements did not apply to military secrets.   But the city is standing firm on the bottom-line issue of localauthority.   ``We do feel we have the authority to regulate what goes throughour city streets, to determine who we want to contract with ...getting some control over what happens in our city,'' said CityAttorney Jayne Williams.   ``We don't have the power to change national priorities,'' addedRiles. ``But as individuals and as a collection of individuals in afree democracy we have the right in peacetime to decide where ourresources will be spent and what happens in our communities.''</TEXT></DOC>
