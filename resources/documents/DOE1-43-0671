Two series of equations are presented forpredicting the green and ovendry masses of the total above-ground tree,stem, merchantable stem, wood and bark of the merchantable stem, unmerchantablestem, and crown. The first series of equations uses diameter at breastheight and the total height as predictors, while the second series usesonly the diameter at breast height. 17 refs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
