An extension of the existing EDP, the computer-controlledrepresentation of results and of theoretical investigations was associatedwith this. Due to a larger flying program, documents on the natural radiationintensity in the Harz area and cover certain industrial, mining and wastedisposal areas were produced. It is shown how the counting rates measuredwith the gamma ray spectrometer at altitude can be converted to equivalentdose rate of the radiation at ground level (for radiation sources distributedover large areas) by various corrections and conversions. The conditionsin which a radioactive point source on the radiating earth's surfaceis traced by measurements in flight, are examined. A 256 channel analyserwas used.</TEXT></DOC>
