Adamson, 83, was slain when Somali bandits who attacked three ofhis assistants opened fire on his vehicle with automatic weapons ashe tried to run them down, said Richard Leakey, Kenya's director ofwildlife. Two of his assistants also were killed.   The Adamsons helped popularize wildlife conservation. Joy Adamsonpropelled them to fame with the books ``Born Free,'' ``Living Free''and ``Forever Free,'' describing their practice of taking lions bornin captivity, teaching them to survive and releasing them into thewild.   She was killed by a servant in a wage dispute in 1980.   Adamson died Sunday near his camp in the remote Kora NationalReserve of northeastern Kenya, where he helped dozens of lions learnto survive in the bush.   Leakey said Monday three of the British conservationist'sassistants had set off for a nearby airstrip to pick up guests theconservationist expected for lunch.   Three Somalis forced the assistants to stop by shooting out theirtires, then robbed the men and beat one of them with an iron bar,breaking his legs, Leakey said.   The shots could be heard in Adamson's camp about a mile away andhe went to investigate, with three other assistants. As theyapproached the scene, an assistant armed with a rifle urged Adamsonto stop the vehicle, but he decided to attack instead.   ``He put his foot on the accelerator and drove straight into thebandits and a hail of bullets,'' said Leakey, who went to Kora onMonday to investigate the killing with Philip Kilonzo, the policecommissioner. ``It was a tremendous show of bravery.''   He said Adamson and two assistants were killed, but the man withthe rifle survived by jumping out when he realized Adamson did notplan to stop.   Leakey said the man who was beaten identified the attackers bytheir speech as Somalis and heard them tell each other to shoot tokill. He said 150 security personnel had been sent to the area andan 80-mile radius around Adamson's camp was sealed off.   He said Adamson would be buried with honors at Kora by the Kenyangovernment.   In London, the naturalist and filmmaker David Attenborough saidthe death of Adamson was ``very, very tragic news.''   ``George Adamson was an extraordinary man, absolutelyextraordinary,'' said Attenborough, who made a program about Elsaand her cubs. ``He became very attached to the lions. He wasprepared to stand up for them against anybody and anything. Clearly,that wasn't always popular.''   Kenyan officials had been concerned about attacks by Somalitribesmen, known as Shifta, since a major anti-poaching effortpushed most of them out of Kenya's game reserves, Leakey said.   He said Adamson refused additional protection and did not want toleave Kora, where he felt protected by his 16 lions and more thanhalf a dozen assistants.   It was largely because of agitation by Adamson, who moved to Korain 1971, that the government made it a game reserve three yearslater.   Encroachment by nomadic Somalis and their herds led Adamson topressure officials into sending the anti-poaching troops to removethem.   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1983, Adamson saidhe had been told of a plot by Somalis to murder him in hopes that,with him gone, there would be little pressure on the government topolice the reserve.   Leakey said authorities believed the motive of Sunday's attackwas robbery, not murder.   Adamson was born in India in 1906. He first visited Kenya in 1924and later moved to the East African nation, joining its gamedepartment in 1938. He retired in 1963.   When he married Joy, an Austrian artist, in 1944, he was gamewarden of Kenya's Northern Frontier District   Twelve years later, he brought home three motherless lion cubs.The one they called Elsa became the central character of ``BornFree.''   The Adamsons, who had no children, separated and she moved to theShaba game reserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards. She waskilled there in 1980.   Adamson, whose shoulder-length flaxen hair and goatee made himresemble his beloved lions, lived in the modest camp at Kora on apension, interest from a trust Joy established and donations fromadmirers.   He wrote two books, ``Bwana Game'' and an autobiography, ``MyPride and Joy.''</TEXT></DOC>
