The Army, for the second time in four years, selected BerettaUSA, a subsidiary of Armi Beretta SpA, over Smith andamp; Wesson ofSpringfield, Mass. Sturm, Ruger andamp; Co. of Southport, Conn., also wasrejected by the Army.   The Army on Monday said sample weapons submitted for testing bySmith andamp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger failed to meet minimum performancerequirements and the Beretta USA M-9 tested significantly better.   ``I cannot say at this time that the tests were rigged, but myhunting dog nose tells me that something might be amiss here,''said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass. ``I will not give up until I amcertain Smith andamp; Wesson is given a fair shake.''   Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass, said he and Conte ``will scrutinizeevery aspect of this competition. If there is a hint of anyirregularity, we'll insist on a full explanation and appropriatecorrective action.''   ``We have not seen the test results yet, but I will insist upona full accounting by the Defense Department,'' he said.   The latest competition was ordered by Congress after Conte andformer Democratic Rep. Edward P. Boland of Springfield, complainedthat Beretta was unfairly awarded a contract in 1985 to build itsM-9 pistol as the replacement for the military's venerable Colt .45.   The General Accounting Office agreed with the lawmakers thatSmith andamp; Wesson was improperly shut out of the final bidding processfor the original $75 million contract to build 315,000 pistols.   The new contract competition is worth $9.9 million to build56,705 guns, the Army said.   ``The General Accounting Office on two separate occasions foundagainst the Army in favor of Smith andamp; Wesson,'' Conte said. ``The(House) Government Operations Committee agreed that Smith andamp; Wessonhas previously been treated unfairly in technicaldisqualifications, and here we are again. You can rest assured thatI will look into every aspect of this evaluation.''   The Army, in its statement Monday, did not specify the problemswith the Smith andamp; Wesson or Sturm Ruger guns. Army officials saidthey would brief the companies Thursday at the Aberdeen (Md.)Proving Ground.   The contract award comes in the wake of a series of problemswith the 140,000 Beretta pistols already delivered.   Beretta, which opeates a plant in Accokeek, Md., where the gunsare assembled, agreed last summer to suspend deliveries while itcorrected a problem that led to a dangerous cracking of the gun'schamber slide. Deliveries resumed earlier this month, according toBeretta officials.   The Army ordered reduced usage of the guns after a fifthaccident in which a chamber slide cracked, sending fragments towardthe shooter's chest.   In March, the Navy said its SEAL commando forces would notswitch to the Beretta 9mm because of the slide failures.</TEXT></DOC>
