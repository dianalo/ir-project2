The government also released 20 imprisoned Iranians to improverelations with its western neighbor, but an Iranian diplomat saidhis country will not be satisfied until Moslem guerrillas win thecivil war.   In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, Najibsaid his government had received information Pakistan planned firstto attack Jalalabad, about 80 miles east of Kabul and 50 miles westof the Pakistan border.   ``Militarist and reactionary parties envisage swallowing ourcountry and turning it into a fifth province of Pakistan,'' thepresident said in his strongest attack yet on Afghanistan's neighbor.   Pakistan has allowed Moslem guerrillas fighting Najib'sSoviet-backed government to operate from Pakistan.   Pakistan, the United States and Iran have supported theguerrillas, who began fighting in 1978 after the communists tookpower in a coup. In 1979, the Soviets sent troops into Afghanistanto prop up the pro-Marxist government.   Under a U.N.-mediated accord, all Soviet troops must be withdrawnby Wednesday. Radio Moscow reported Saturday the last motorized armyunit was within 125 miles of the Soviet border.   The guerrillas are not party to the U.N. accord and want tooverthrow Najib's government when the Soviets are gone.   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 20Iranian prisoners were freed to commemorate the 10th anniversary ofthe Iranian revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   ``They're being released as a goodwill gesture toward the Iraniangovernment,'' he told a news conference.   Iran's highest-ranking diplomat in Kabul, Charge d'AffairesHussein Intizari, welcomed the release but said it will not improverelations.   ``We are waiting for a government with the mujahedeen,'' he said.   The prisoners appeared to be in good health, but many showedreporters scars and missing teeth and said they had been repeatedlybeaten and tortured.   The Afghan government had no immediate comment on the allegations.   With the withdrawal deadline approaching, Najib exhorted theAfghan people to protect their nation's sovereignty.   ``Say in one voice: `Country or death,''' he said.   He also accused the Pakistani military of controlling theguerrillas.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, there appeared to be no end to the bitterdisputes among guerrilla factions over the composition of aprovisional Islamic government they want to form.   At issue is how power would be shared by the seven insurgentgroups in Pakistan and the eight factions based in Iran.   On Friday, 526 guerrillas and other Afghans met as a council todecide the matter but the Iranian-based alliance walked out.   Rasul Sayyaf, the spokesman for the meeting, said Saturday thecouncil would meet ``in two or three days.''   He said efforts to persuade the Iranian-based guerrillas not toboycott the council failed.   ``We cannot expect quick solutions to the problem ofAfghanistan,'' he said at a news conference.   Radio Moscow said patrols along the Salang Highway, the mainroute between Kabul and the Soviet border, were being discontinued.   According to the report, the last motorized Soviet unit traveledthrough a mountain pass on the Salang Highway. It did not say howmany troops or what kind of equipment were in the unit.   The report also said a ``small group'' of soldiers will remain inKabul, the Afghan capital, to guard the airport until the Sovietscomplete a massive food airlift.   A Soviet officer, Col. Pavel Vinokunov, said in Kabul the airliftwill continue until Monday and his men will depart then.   Col. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the military chief of staff, has saidthe last Soviet soldier will leave Afghanistan on Tuesday.   Soviet officials have said the Red Army contingent in Afghanistannumbered 115,000 before the pullout began May 15 and that half hadleft by Aug. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
