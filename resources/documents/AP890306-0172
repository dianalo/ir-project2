His remarks appeared to quash any prospect that an election delaycould be a first step toward ending the 9-year-old civil war.   On Jan. 24, the rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Frontoffered to take part in the presidential election and respect itsoutcome if it were postponed until September and if security andanti-fraud conditions were met.   The guerrillas had rejected all previous elections this decade assham.   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a ChristianDemocrat, suggested the election be delayed by six weeks rather thansix months. The rebels said that was insufficient.   The single-chamber legislature has virtual veto power over anypostponement and is controlled by the opposition rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance. The alliance, known as ARENA, is favored towin the presidential election and has rejected any postponement ofthe vote.   The constitution says the election must be held at least twomonths before a new government takes office. Duarte's term ends onJune 1.   The Christian Democrats have said elections could be legallypostponed and an interim president named by the legislature if apolitical consensus to do so exists.   The Farabundo Marti on Saturday said direct talks with thegovernment on their proposal must be held Tuesday and Wednesday inSan Salvador, the capital.   It repeated its accusation that the government wasprocrastinating.   The civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of themcivilians.</TEXT></DOC>
