At the same time, however, the high court said that theallegations of altered quotations in a psychoanalyst'slawsuit against the New Yorker magazine and writer JanetMalcolm were substantial enough to require a jury trial inthe case.</LP><TEXT>   The decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, was asurprising victory for the news media, despite Ms. Malcolm'shaving to face a trial. First Amendment experts whorepresented the news media have feared for months that thecourt might rule that the use of altered quotations is,itself, evidence sufficient for a public figure to prevail ina libel lawsuit.   By a 9-0 vote, the high court ordered a trial of thecelebrated lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Masson against themagazine and Ms. Malcolm. After extensive pretrialproceedings, a federal district court had dismissed Mr.Masson's lawsuit in 1987. A federal appeals court affirmedthe dismissal in 1989. Both courts, located in San Francisco,found that Mr. Masson's pretrial allegations failed to showthat the magazine's or author's actions could lead toliability.   Mr. Masson sued the magazine and Ms. Malcolm in 1984,charging that he was libeled by quotations that wereattributed to him that he either never said or that werealtered. Ms. Malcolm has repeatedly denied altering orfabricating quotes, but the lawsuit was dismissed before shecould attempt to prove it.   Mr. Masson argued that the false quotations weresufficient to satisfy the tough legal burden that the SupremeCourt has placed on public figures who sue for libel. Suchpublic figures, according to the landmark 1964 ruling, NewYork Times vs. Sullivan, must prove that the libelousstatements were made with knowledge that they were false orwith reckless disregard for whether they were true.   Yesterday, the high court ruled, 7-2, that evidence ofaltered or fabricated quotations isn't proof of knowledge offalsity or of reckless disregard. The high court said a libelplaintiff must also prove that the meaning of the remarks wasmaterially changed.   Justices Byron White and Antonin Scalia dissented, sayingthat the news media should be held to a higher standard ofaccuracy. They agreed with the majority that the New Yorkercase should go to trial.   Bruce Sanford, a Washington lawyer who represents newsmedia clients, said the decision was important for what itdidn't do. &quot;The court didn't avail itself of an opportunityto make a sea-change in American libel law,&quot; he said.   An issue that arises frequently in such cases is whetherthe news media can have libel lawsuits dismissed without theexpense and commitment of time of a trial. Mr. Sanford saidthe ruling yesterday won't make it more difficult for thenews media to have such lawsuits thrown out. But others areless certain, recalling that some past Supreme Courtdecisions have prompted judges to push more libel cases allthe way to trial. (Masson vs. New Yorker)                                                                                                          Court-in-Brief                                                                                                          In other actions yesterday, the high court:   -- Ruled, 7-2, that states can adopt mandatory retirementlaws for state and local judges. The decision, written byJustice Sandra O'Connor, said that neither the federal lawthat prohibits age discrimination in employment, nor theConstitution's guarantee of equal protection prevents a statefrom setting a retirement age for judges. The court upheld aMissouri law that requires judges to retire at age 70. Some30 states have similar laws. Justices Harry Blackmun andThurgood Marshall dissented. (Gregory vs. Ashcroft)   -- Ruled, 6-3, that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 appliesfully to the election of state court judges. The decision,written by Justice John Stevens, means states will besubjected to a panoply of anti-discrimination requirementsfor judicial elections, both for trial courts and for appealsand supreme courts. Justice Scalia dissented, joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy. (Chisom vs.Roemer; Houston Lawyers' Association vs. Texas AttorneyGeneral)   -- By a 6-3 vote, rejected the Florida Supreme Court'sruling that police can't search luggage on a bus even if thepassenger consents, without triggering the Fourth Amendment'srequirement for a search warrant. In an opinion written byJustice O'Connor, the court made it easier for lawenforcement officials to use the increasingly common tacticof searching buses for drugs. Justices Marshall, Blackmun andStevens dissented. (Florida vs. Bostick)</TEXT></DOC>
