Martial law was lifted in July after 38 years in force. LastFriday and Saturday, riot police and demonstrators battled inTaipei for 18 hours, and there has been talk the government mightbring back martial law.   More than 200 people reportedly were injured and 96 protesterswere detained in the riots, which broke out after a farmers' rightsdemonstration. The violence was the worst on this island since1947, when native Taiwanese staged an uprising against Nationalistforces who had arrived from the Chinese mainland.   A group of 75 legislators issued a statement calling the recentrioting ``a bloody incident unprecedented in 40 years.'' They urgedthe government to partially reimpose martial law because the nationhad reached ``the moment of life and death.''   The statement said violent protests threatened national securityand Taiwan's economic development.   Most members of the Legislative Yuan who signed the statementwere elected on mainland China shortly before 1949, when they andthe rest of the Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losinga civil war to the Communists.   The Nationalist government claims to be the rightful ruler ofall China.   A group of 27 lawmakers comprised mostly of Nationalistlegislators elected in Taiwan issued a statement opposed to areturn to martial law and said it would drive ``the vehicle ofdemocracy backward.''   The rioting was a temporary disorder and the government shouldnot easily give up its achievement in democracy, the statement said.   Since the lifting of martial law, under which demonstrationswere banned, protests have been held almost daily by dissidents andother groups pressing a wide variety of political and economicdemands.   Newspapers reported Thursday that members of the party'spolicy-making Central Standing Committee held heated discussions ata weekly meeting Wednesday about whether the government shouldreimpose martial law.   Taipei police, meanwhile, turned down an application by afarmer's group to march in Taipei on Tuesday, claiming theorganization violated demonstration laws during previous protests.   Lin Feng-hsi, spokesman of the group, said the farmers wanted tomarch to apologize to Taipei residents for last week's violentprotest.   Also Friday, the Nationalist Party announced that three sons ofthe late President Chiang Ching-kuo were elected delegates to theNationalist Party congress this summer.   Chiang, who died in January, was the son of Chiang Kai-shek, wholed the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949. He was the main architectof the recent policies of easing the Nationalists' authoritariangrip on Taiwan and allowing unofficial contacts with China.</TEXT></DOC>
