<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0660 </DOCNO><TEXT>A 8 MW quasi continuous 3.7 GHz Lower Hybrid heating experiment is designedmainly for current drive studies on the TORE SUPRA Tokamak. The designof such an important system is complex, in particular for the launchers,because the number of wareguides needed for coupling this high levelof RF power is large (-- 250). A large simplification of the L.H. launcheris obtained by using a modular building of the coupler. Each module ownsinternal RF splitting using a 4 wg E plane multijunction (M.J.) and a3 dB RF divider. The E plane M.J. when used in travelling waves, allowsfurthermore to decrease strongly the power reflection coefficient towardsthe generator which is an important point for the RF klystron transmitter.In the PETULA Tokamak, a 500 kW -30 3.7 GHz experiment using such typesof modules has been successfully performed. The reduction of the powerreflection coefficient in the percent range and an RF transmitted powerdensity of -- 5 kW/cm/sup 2/ -which fulfill the T.S. requirements-havebeen achieved. For T.S. experiment, the quasi CW operating mode associatedwith the high working temperature (250{sup 0}C) and large mechanicalstresses involved by plasma disruption, require a high mechanical propertycopper alloy for the module material.</TEXT></DOC>
