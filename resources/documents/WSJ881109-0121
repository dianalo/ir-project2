In swaps, two parties hedge interest-rate risk by exchanging interest payments on debt. Usually, one party exchanges a floating-rate payment with another that has a fixed-rate payment. Banks act as intermediaries, taking a fee from the payment streams for arranging the transaction. The risk in swaps for banks is that if one side of a swap defaults, the bank remains obligated to make the other party's payment.    The rule, proposed jointly by the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., wouldn't alter banks' reported earnings, since the measure only would apply to accounting for regulatory purposes. The regulators have given banks until Jan. 9, 1989 to comment on the proposal. If adopted, the rule would become effective retroactive to Jan. 1.    However, the Financial Accounting Standards Board's emerging issues task force also has the subject on its agenda. If the rule-making body for accountants adopts a similar rule, reported income of some major banks could be hurt.    James J. McDermott, executive vice president and research director of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said both the federal and FASB moves &quot;could have a big impact on swaps players.&quot;    Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, said it already is in compliance with the proposal. Thomas E. Jones, senior vice president and chief accounting officer, said, &quot;The rules that they will be issuing are very close to the policy we have followed, namely, no front-ending of fee income.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
