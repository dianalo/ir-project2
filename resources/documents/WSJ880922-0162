STARRETT Co. shareholders approved a 2-for-1 split at its annual meeting. The split will result in the issuance of one new Class B common share for each share currently held. The new stock will be paid Oct. 5, to shares of record next Tuesday. All shares currently outstanding will be designated as Class A common stock. The Athol, Mass., maker of measuring tools had said it plans to raise the dividend on post-split shares to 16 cents a share. The company paid a quarterly of 30 cents on pre-split shares in June. The Class B common will have 10 votes a share on all matters save that holders of Class A common will elect 25% of the directors, with the remaining 75% of the directors elected by the combined vote of both classes. The new stock will be nontransferrable but convertible into shares of Class A common on a share-for-share basis. </TEXT></DOC>
