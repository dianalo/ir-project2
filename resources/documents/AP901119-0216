He read the book from which the TV movie wasadapted.   Garner plays a retired judge in the two-hour drama, set inGeorgia in 1975. The judge comes to the aid of a black man whorefuses to accept a Medal of Honor for heroism won 31 years earlierin World War II.   ``I hardly ever read the book after the script,'' Garner says.``You lose so much between the book and the script.   ``The problem is that when you're doing it you remembersomething from the book that's not in the script. You don't want tofall into that trap. It was probably left out for a reason.''   The drama, a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation on NBC onSunday, was adapted by Robert Lenski from the novella by the lateJohn William Corrington.   ``I was familiar with the author's work,'' Garner says. ``I'dread several of his books. He lived in New Orleans until he diedabout a year ago.''   Garner says that at this point in his acting career he looks forquality scripts.   ``I want things that have to do with people and the humancondition,'' he says. ``I don't think you have to blow up citiesand kill people to entertain. It's a pleasant script. `Murphy'sRomance' was pleasant.   ``I had an opportunity to buy `Rambo.' This guy blows up a wholetown and kills half the National Guard because a cop offends him.What kind of morality is that?''   In ``Decoration Day,'' the Defense Department suddenly realizesit has overlooked giving the medal to the black veteran. He refusesthe medal on principle. And when his former employer writes theletter of refusal a government lawyer fears a white conspiracy toblock the presentation.   Garner's character is Albert Sidney Finch, who retired from thebench after the death of his wife. Bill Cobbs is Gee Penniwell, ablack veteran of World War II and a boyhood friend of Finch's untilthey grew apart.   Judith Ivey is a legal secretary who becomes close to Finch whenshe prepares his case for Penniwell. Ruby Dee is Finch'shousekeeper, Norm Skaggs is his nephew, Jennifer Robertson is hisnephew's wife and Larry Fishburne is the government lawyer.   ``You wait for something wonderful to come along,'' says Garner,who starred in the TV series ``Maverick'' and ``The RockfordFiles'' and such movies as ``The Great Escape,'' ``TheAmericanization of Emily,'' ``Grand Prix,'' ``Victor-Victoria'' and``Murphy's Romance.''   ``Decoration Day'' is the third Hall of Fame drama for Garner,who previously starred in ``Promise'' and ``My Name is Bill W,''and the eighth for producer Marian Rees. Robert Markowitz directedon location in Georgia, although the original story was set inLouisiana.   ``I wear an `Indiana Jones' hat that was given to me years agoby Stuart Margolin,'' Garner says. ``I had the brim cut down. It'sone of those things you pull out of the closet. Most of thewardrobe is mine. The pants, the fishing vest. It works better ifyou wear things that are yours.''   Garner, who was wounded in combat in the Korean War, says he canidentify with a veteran offered a medal years later.   ``When I was doing `Tank' I mentioned that I had never receivedthe Purple Heart,'' he says. ``I was with the 24th Division. Ourposition had been overrun and all the records had been lost. So asa PR thing the Army gave me the medal. So the fact that they wantto give this man the Medal of Honor 31 years later makes sense tome. It happened to me.''   Garner's first major movie after the war was ``Sayonara,'' a1957 film in which he played a Marine pilot.   ``I was doing `Sayonara' when Warner Bros. was looking at everyactor in Hollywood for `Maverick,''' he says. ``Then they noticedme in the dailies and said, `Let's use him. He's already undercontract.' I did the pilot, and when I got back from Japan Istarted `Maverick.'   ``I got $500 a week the first season, with no residuals. I got$600 the second year, $1,250 the third year. My competition was EdSullivan, who got $25,000 a week.''   Both ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford Files'' are consideredtelevision classics.   ``It's all luck,'' Garner says. ``No, it's not all luck, butthere was a lot of luck involved.''   He doubts he will do another series.   ``People have no idea how hard an hour-long series is,'' hesays. ``Even if I did a half-hour show I'd have to work hard,especially to maintain the integrity of it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Dec. 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
