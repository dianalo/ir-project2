The Times of London on Monday reported that Bucharest is buildinga wall along its border with Hungary and Yugoslavia to preventdefections.   Hungary's official MTI news agency said Tuesday that its borderguards had reported ``no signs of wall construction.''   ``Nevertheless, a 2{-meter wire fence is being set up on theRomanian side of the border ... which has been completed along 90percent of the border length,'' the agency said.   ``Since it appears to be an ordinary wire fence, the (Hungarian)border guards suppose that no electricity will be led into it,'' theagency said. It added that the fence is about 80 feet insideRomanian territory.   ``The latest works indicate that ditches have been dug on bothsides of the fence to prevent breakthroughs by cars,'' MTI said.   Romania's border with Hungary extends 275 miles.   An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians,have fled to Hungary in the past few years seeking refuge fromchronic hardships under the regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu.Ethnic Hungarians also claim discriminatory policies towardminorities in Romania.   During the first five months of this year, 3,231 Romanianscrossed ilegally into Hungary, deputy Interior Minister Zoltan Galsaid last week.   He said the Cabinet would soon discuss plans to open threerefugees camps in eastern Hungary to cope with the influx.</TEXT></DOC>
