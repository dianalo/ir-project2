Thefailure of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corp.provides further evidence that private insurance systems donot relieve government of being the insurer of last resort.   Within hours of the start of the bank holiday last week,Rhode Island state legislators began demanding a taxpayerbailout of affected depositors. With many Rhode Islandersstill being denied access to their funds, a quick resolutionappears likely to prevent angry depositors from becomingangry voters.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the public bailout of the Ohio Deposit GuaranteeCorp. in 1985 through a $100 million bond issue and thepending one in Rhode Island, privatizing federal depositinsurance is still being debated in both academic andpolitical circles as a viable alternative to the currentdeposit insurance system.   Admittedly, getting government out of the insurancebusiness is an appealing idea. First, it is correctly assumedthat such private insurers as insurance companies or otherbanks (the &quot;mutual insurance&quot; plan) would more efficientlyprice the insurance. Second, it would increase discipline, asthe insurer would no longer be backed by the full faith andcredit of the government and its own solvency could be atstake.   The Ohio system's downfall, caused by the failure of HomeState Savings Bank, which had invested more than 80% of itsassets in repurchase agreements with a soon-to-be-insolventsecurities firm, and the Rhode Island system's failure from acash drain of $13 million from the Heritage Loan andamp; InvestmentCo. point to a basic problem with such funds -- their smallsize provides little diversification against the risk of onelarge member's failure. It is argued that larger and moregeographically diversified funds would encounter problemsonly during the severest of economic downturns.   But such arguments for privatization ignore the issue ofwho will insure the insurer. With mutual deposit insurance,the failure of the troubled institutions and their insurerbanks would increase the severity of the banking crisis. Ifmassive bank failures became the responsibility of evencash-rich life-insurance companies, consumers might be facedwith the prospect of not being able to afford to live or die.   Some have suggested an escape clause for the insurers ifbank failures become too widespread. In addition to placingthe government back in the position of insurer of lastresort, it would make a sham of the argument of efficientpremium pricing by private firms.   Any deposit-insurance reform proposal must satisfy twocriteria. First, the solvency of the insurer must beprotected to ensure stability in the financial system. Theinsolvency of just one member of any fund that depletessufficient reserves would cause bank runs, as was the case inOhio. Second, any proposal must be able to check excessiverisk-taking on the part of the member institutions (the&quot;moral hazard&quot; issue). Clearly, the current deposit-insurancesystem of fixed-rate premiums with no risk adjustment hasplayed a large part in the fiscal woes of the FDIC (not tomention the FSLIC).   Private insurance funds also have the added disadvantageof preying on the less financially sophisticated. More than afew depositors at Home State Savings managed to withdrawtheir cash before the bank's collapse only to place theirfunds in another institution insured by the Ohio DepositGuarantee Corp. An analysis of depositors at Home Staterevealed that most were elderly and many did not graduatefrom high school. Small depositors are hardly the peoplepoliticians wish to penalize in order to get the governmentout of the deposit-insurance business.   As Congress begins examining alternatives to governmentstaying in the deposit insurance business, it will becomeapparent that none of the proposals currently being discussedwill both check excessive risk-taking and stabilize thebanking system.   The various forms of market discipline being discussed tomake depositors more vigilant in ensuring their banks'financial health ignore the fact that the public has gottenused to deposit insurance and will be incensed if any lossesare incurred, especially after the burgeoning thrift bailoutcost. Such market-discipline proposals as greater financialdisclosure by banks and publication of the bank problem listwill only add to a loss of consumer confidence in the bankingsystem.   Proposals for risk-adjusted premiums, the most intuitivelyappealing option, have yet to be set in motion. The increasedcapital standards set to be enforced in 1992 do nothing toaddress the moral hazard issue.   A proposal to have banks issue debt with claimssubordinated to depositors uses a third party (in this case,bondholders) to provide added capital. This idea meritsfurther consideration. It meets the requirement of helping toprotect the solvency of the insurance fund and thusincreasing consumer confidence in the banking system. To alimited extent, it also has the advantage of checkingexcessive risk-taking, as riskier banks would have to payhigher interest rates. Such subordinated debentures arecurrently being counted by regulators only as secondarycapital, due to their limited life.   Although not a perfect proposal as banks would be facedwith more interest-rate risk, and writing off losses againstdebt is more complicated than simply deducting them fromequity accounts, the idea is worth investigating further.Privatization is not.   ---   Mr. Rubens is a professor of finance at Bryant College inSmithfield, R.I.</TEXT></DOC>
