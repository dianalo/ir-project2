(products).andO;Product:   Cad/Base 1.1 (CAD software).andO;Topic:     Computer-aided designData base management systemsSoftware packagesEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Database Management for DXFandM;THE VAN DER ROEST GROUP, CAD/BASEandM;1.1, $2,950andM;Cad/Base is a specialized database manager for maintaining data extractedfrom DXF format files produced by a variety of CAD packages.andP;  It isimplemented as a front end to Revelation Technologies Inc.'s AdvancedRevelation (ARev) database-development system.andP;  The Cad/Base package includesa full copy of the ARev product and R/Graph, van der Roest Group's graphingpackage for ARev databases.andM;Cad/Base is different from the other two products in that its database andgraphic capabilities are totally separate.andP;  While attributes are beingentered and manipulated in the database, the objects defined by thoseattributes are not displayed on-screen.andP;  The user therefore cannotsimultaneously see a picture of an object and a list of its attributes.andM;From the DXF files, Cad/Base extracts the identification and location ofobjects in the drawing; all other attributes are entered by the user intoARev files, which can then be linked relationally into a variety of logicalviews.andM;The entire gamut of ARev input and import capabilities is available forbuilding these files.andP;  Attribute files may be global, providing data for manydrawings.andM;CAD programs keep drawing data in a proprietary binary format, but Cad/Baserequires data in DXF text format.andP;  Converting binary data to DXF format forexport to Cad/Base creates an additional copy of the data, raising thepossibility of one or the other copy becoming out of date.andP;  However, most CADprograms have the option of reading and writing DXF files directly, thusmaintaining only one copy of the drawing.andM;The van der Roest Group is also developing direct interfaces to binarydrawing data; a version that reads VersaCAD binary files should be availableby the time this review is published.andM;Installation involves first installing ARev, then Cad/Base itself.andP;  Thisrequires following two separate procedures in two manuals, but both processesare very straightforward.andP;  The resulting directory structure is rather flat,with almost 200 files in the main Cad/Base directory -- but that is acharacteristic of ARev rather than Cad/Base.andM;The primary Cad/Base documentation consists of two loose-leaf volumes with acombined index; a third volume covers the R/Graph package.andP;  In addition,there are several thousand pages of manuals for ARev.andP;  Finding informationthat is spread out over so many pieces gets tedious on occasion, but thecontent of all the manuals is very good.andM;The van der Roest Group Inc., in Santa Ana, Calif., can be reached at (714)542-2201.andM;----------Buyers say: Good reportingandM;&quot;Our main objective was to be able to utilize our drawings as a data filedirectly rather than having to go through attribute extractions and moving inor out of AutoCAD,&quot; said Doug Dixon, chief CAE engineer at Gulf StatesUtilities, an electric utility company in Beaumont, Texas.andM;Cad/Base and AutoCAD are installed on Compaq 386 machines with 5M or 6M bytesof RAM.andM;Dixon is developing a database within Cad/Base to enable non-drafting staffto make non-standard changes to standard drawings.andM;This database will allow the staff to cut the time it uses to produce thesedrawings in half, said Dixon.andM;&quot;We build menus and input screens so that somebody in the engineeringdepartment can input [data such as] an electrical component with specifics --for instance transformer size -- import the information into the drawing andgenerate an estimate,&quot; said Dixon.andM;Cost information for the estimates is maintained and updated on a mainframeand downloaded to the PC.andP;  &quot;Monthly, we will update cost information byextracting the current information off the mainframe and accessing the fileused to build estimates,&quot; said Dixon, who added that some changes in spacingof data are needed to get the information into a form that the database canuse.andM;A weakness of Cad/Base, according to Dixon, is its inability to bring insymbols directly from outside libraries.andP;  &quot;You have to bring [the symbols] inthrough AutoCAD, and once they are in there you can delete them, remove themor replace them,&quot; said Dixon.andP;  However, it is possible to bring symbols intoa drawing layer and freeze that layer in order to incorporate the symbols indrawings when needed, Dixon said.andM;Joe Nix, project manager in the CAD department of KHR andamp; Associates, a civilengineering company in Irvine, Calif., uses Cad/Base as a link to createreports from the AutoCAD drawings for a traffic-control project.andM;Cad/Base is installed on 33MHz 386 computers with 4M bytes of RAM and100M-byte hard disks.andM;&quot;The project itself needed a database link that would be able to bring up thedrawing and display a certain part of the city,&quot; said Nix, &quot;and I don't haveto go into the drawing to change it.&quot;andM;Nix has developed reports and customized the database to fit his needs.andO;&quot;Cad/ Base comes with its own development end so you can avoid the hairystuff,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;When you hit F2 at a certain point, [Cad/Base] will build the code for youto plug in,&quot; Nix added.andM;Once a report is created, it is immediately accessible without having tosearch or query the database.andM;&quot;Cad/Base always keeps track of every report you have done; if you use itonce, it is immediately available the next time,&quot; said Nix.andM;----------Reviews by Ted Mirecki; interviews by Karen Moser; edited by Paul HartyandM;The three reviewed products represent two different approaches to structuringdata.andM;Drawbase uses a flat file, while CADvance and Cad/Base can use either a flatfile or a multilevel, relational-database structure.andM;In a flat file, there is one data record for each object, and all the datadescribing the object is found in that record.andM;For example, consider the data on the windows in a building design.andP;  If thereare 100 identical windows, then a flat-file database repeats all of the dataabout each window in each record.andP;  The supplier, price and other unchanginginformation appears in the file 100 times.andM;The main advantage of a relational structure is that it reduces dataredundancy.andP;  The disadvantage is that it adds complexity.andM;In a relational database, the 100 records representing the 100 windowscontain only that data which is different for each individual window: windowtype and location.andP;  A second file of objects by type contains one record pertype, listing the data common to all objects of that type, such as price,size, supplier code and so on.andP;  A third file might contain the names andaddresses of suppliers of the various objects.andM;The elimination of redundant data not only saves file space but alsoincreases data integrity.andP;  When there are multiple copies of a data item,there is a chance that some copies will get updated, but not others.andM;It is not necessary to update each copy individually, because every practicalflat-file data manager (Drawbase included) has a mass-update command thatautomatically changes a data value in all the records of a specified set ofrecords.andM;Still, multiple copies provide multiple chances for error.andM;The disadvantage of relational files is their complexity.andP;  In the previousexample, fully describing any particular window requires collecting data fromtwo or three separate files.andM;Enforcing relational integrity (ensuring that all the records describing eachobject actually exist) requires significant programming effort; neither dBASE(used with CADvance) nor Advanced Revelation (used by Cad/Base) provides thiscapability automatically.andM;-- Ted Mirecki</TEXT></DOC>
