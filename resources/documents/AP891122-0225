Nobody can expect that the sight of a savings bond ormutual-fund confirmation statement sticking out of a Christmasstocking will light up an 8-year-old's eyes.   But what an investment gift lacks in short-term gratificationcan be more than offset by long-term appreciation, in both theeconomic and emotional senses of the word.   We're not talking just ``money'' here, but the start of somesavings and investment program that can be added to and grow overtime to help a young person start building for the future.   A financial present can be ``more personal than cash and moredurable than this year's fashions,'' in the words of Standard andamp;Poor's Corp.'s advisory publication The Outlook.   Fine, you might say, but 500 shares of IBM costs a little morethan I planned to spend (it would run you a little more than$50,000, counting commissions, and would saddle you with acumbersome gift-tax burden besides).   Then what about one, five or 10 shares of some company youbelieve provides a good product or valuable service that offers theprospect of growth in the years ahead?   A single share of stock doesn't come cheap through the usualchannels. You could be charged as much in commissions as the priceof the share itself.   If you have a good working relationship with a bank or brokeragefirm, however, you might be able to persuade that worthyintermediary to waive its usual fees as a courtesy.   Alternatively, you might try phoning the investor relationsdepartment of the company itself for suggestions about how best toproceed. A well-run company should be eager to acquire young,potentially long-term shareholders.   While you are at it, check to see if the company has a dividendreinvestment plan that allows for periodic additional purchases ofshares without brokerage commissions, or possibly even at adiscount. In a few cases, it may be possible even to buy the firstshare through the reinvestment plan.   Of course, the stock of an individual company is only one ofnumerous choices open to financial gift shoppers.   Some mutual funds offer to open accounts with initialinvestments of $250 or $500. A few set no minimum at all.   Among the simplest of all possibilities are bank investments,such as certificates of deposit, and U.S. savings bonds, which canbe bought for as little as $25 at most financial institutions orfrom your nearest Federal Reserve bank or branch.   These options come with no commissions or other fees. Beware,however, of bank accounts that reduce their interest rates andimpose maintenance charges for balances below specified levels.   Or if you are of a mind to protect the youngster from alleventualities, there is always gold, sold by many banks and brokersin the form of bars, bullion coins or custodial receipts.   Though the standard unit for most gold investments is a troyounce, recently base-priced at just above $400, several areavailable in fractions of an ounce.   ``Remember that you will pay more per ounce for gold if you buysmaller sizes,'' Standard andamp; Poor's analysts caution.   Whatever your preference, give some thought to discussing afinancial gift with a child's parents before it is bestowed, ifonly to see that it fits in with whatever other planning and savingmeasures are being taken.   Most investment gifts to children are made under arrangementssuch as state ``gift to minors'' statutes, which require thedesignation of an adult as a custodian.   There is also the matter to be decided beforehand of who willtake responsibility for any tax bills or other expenses that arisefrom the investment while the child is still growing up.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Nov 23</NOTE></DOC>
