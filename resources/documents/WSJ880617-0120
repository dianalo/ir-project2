In an interview before leaving Sunday for Washington, Rupert Scholz, who assumed his duties last month, said, &quot;I believe the Federal Republic is actually contributing its share of the roles, risks and responsibilities,&quot; and added that growing U.S. demands for additional financial contributions aren't realistic.    The new German defense minister is making his first official visit to the U.S. He will be in Washington Monday and Tuesday, talking with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and other officials, as well as members of Congress. He is sure to hear much about &quot;burden sharing,&quot; the new U.S. catch phrase that implies Europeans must bear more of the cost of defending Western Europe while the U.S. is experiencing trade and budget deficits. Instead, some European defense budgets are shrinking.    Mr. Scholz said he expects West Germany's military budget to increase next year. He added that critics also should take into account nonfinancial defense contributions by Europeans, such as West Germany's decisions to extend active-duty service by draftees to 18 months from 15 months and to provide territory for North Atlantic Treaty Organization bases and maneuvers.    &quot;I would prefer measuring contributions in a more output-oriented way,&quot; Mr. Scholz said. &quot;What counts in the end is not the money invested but the fighting capability produced for the common benefit of the allies.&quot;    Mr. Scholz insisted the burden-sharing issue isn't a fundamental dispute. He said he expects the next U.S. president to stick to current policy and not reduce the U.S. presence in Europe.    He did offer one new policy idea -- a way to speed progress in conventional arms talks between NATO and the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact that are scheduled to resume later this year.    NATO wants the talks to produce cuts of offensive ground forces, especially tank units, where Soviet-led forces greatly outnumber their Western counterparts. The Warsaw Pact insists that tactical aircraft and helicopters, where the West has advantages, also must be included. NATO argues those are necessary to deter possible Soviet invasion.    Mr. Scholz suggested bridging the gap with a two-step approach. Priority, he said, should be on &quot;those weapons systems that are able to gain and hold territory, and that are the core of the Warsaw Pact's invasion capability: tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and artillery.&quot; In the second stage, combat helicopters, bridging equipment, aircraft and other systems might be added, he said.    Mr. Scholz, like his predecessor, Manfred Woerner, who soon will become the new secretary-general of NATO, is considered more skeptical of the Soviets than is West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Mr. Genscher is fond of saying that the West must &quot;take the Soviets at their word.&quot;    By contrast, Mr. Scholz said, &quot;We must judge the Soviets by their deeds, not their words.&quot; For his part, he hasn't noticed much change. &quot;We have, to date, witnessed no relaxation of the military effort pursued by the Soviet Union,&quot; he said. &quot;The steady growth of Soviet military capabilities has not diminished since {Mikhail} Gorbachev took power.&quot;    Mr. Scholz, formerly a little-known West Berlin senator, faces a tough task in persuading Germans to spend more on defense at a time of superpower detente. &quot;We must show the people that the military threat to Europe still exists,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
