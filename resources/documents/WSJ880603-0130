So are Henry Copeland and Lynda Waters.    With the prime rate rising, their adjustable-rate mortgage payments are going up, too. And, for them, that's worrisome. Mr. Roberts, the editor of Florida Business -- Tampa Bay, stopped ogling a $600 sport coat and delayed buying parts for his steam-powered model boats. Mr. Copeland, a New York financial analyst, expects to cut back on dining out and theatergoing. Mrs. Waters, a St. Petersburg, Fla., hotel official, canceled plans to buy an Acura Integra and furnish two rooms recently added to her house.    Interest-rate risk once mainly threatened businesses; now, consumers face a similar danger as a surge in variable-rate debt increasingly -- and quickly -- exposes them to rising rates.    Home-equity loans, typically pegged to the prime rate and adjusted monthly, have quadrupled since 1985 to about $70 billion, largely because they're still tax-deductible. Homeowners were once expected to consolidate other forms of debt into these loans, but SMR Research Corp., a consulting firm, estimates that 60% of home-equity loans represent new borrowings.    Adjustable-rate mortgages, which now total about $423 billion and account for about 70% of new home loans, also rise along with interest rates. Typically, the rates are adjusted annually, and many of these mortgages also have caps limiting the increase in any one year-more protection than that offered by the caps on most home-equity loans.    And consumers now find rates fluctuating on personal loans and credit cards. The Federal Reserve estimates that 10% of the $628.75 billion of consumer installment debt is floating.    &quot;It's a time bomb because the rates are going to go up,&quot; says Andrew J. McGehee of Consumer Credit Counseling Service of South Florida Inc.    Variable-rate consumer debt is clearly an economic wild card. A bit of consumer restraint might be desirable now, but too much could help spark a recession if rates keep rising and consumer spending drops along with discretionary income. And consumers already being hit by rising payments on their variable-rate debt are likely to be especially cautious about taking on more such obligations.    For the first time, month-to-month swings in interest rates could grind up some consumers' budgets. An increase in the prime rate to just 10% would set off a ripple effect that could hurt consumers more than the 20% base lending rate of 1980, says Paul Getman, an economist at WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;Anything beyond 10%, and we would be living on borrowed time,&quot; he says.    People borrowing heavily at variable rates take a big gamble. &quot;You've lost control over your ability to manage your money,&quot; says Leo J. Shapiro, a Chicago consultant who tracks consumer trends. &quot;If interest rates go up, you suddenly have less money than you anticipated.&quot;    So far, consumers have been winning their gamble, taking the risk of rising rates and getting, in return, a lower rate than they would on fixed-rate loans. Still far below its 1980 peak, the prime rate has risen only half a percentage point in recent months to 9%. But some economists see it up to about 11% in a year and worry how much consumer spending may suffer.    No one knows what will happen, because variable-rate consumer loans are so new. As they were mushrooming during the past seven years, the prime rate has generally fallen or remained steady.    &quot;People are in for a shock if rates rise to around 12%,&quot; says William F. Schumann, the president of Insured Credit Services Inc., an Old Republican International Corp. unit that insures home-equity loans. &quot;There will be bankruptcies, and delinquencies will increase.&quot;    The latest half-point increase in the prime isn't expected to dent spending much. David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., estimates the annual interest bill for all types of variable-rate consumer loans will rise almost $4 billion. However, that is dwarfed by the $3 trillion that consumers spend annually.    But rates are rising at a bad time. Consumers have been borrowing at a dizzying pace, with their installment debt alone more than twice the 1981 level. Credit junkies on shoestring budgets will feel any pinch the most, of course. Many now deep in hock are baby-boomers still in their peak spending years and being lured into debt by a marketing blitz by lenders, especially to promote home-equity loans. The borrowers fueling the recent consumer-spending binge are people unlikely to benefit from rising interest income on investments such as certificates of deposit.    &quot;For someone who is on the edge now and facing a layoff, (the prime rate) doesn't have to go up very much,&quot; says Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
