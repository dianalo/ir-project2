About 64.8 million people, or 25 percent of the U.S. populationlived in rural areas in 1988, an increase of more than 900,000 from1987, the government reported.   The total included approximately 4.95 million living on farms, or2 percent of the population. That marked a decrease of 35,000 fromthe previous year.   The report issued Wednesday was prepared by the Agriculture andCommerce departments using estimates from the Census Bureau'smonthly current population survey.   Since 1986, when a new census procedure began, the ruralpopulation has grown more rapidly than the urban population,averaging 2.64 percent, compared with 1.67 percent for urbanresidents.   ``The 1988 farm population estimate of 4,951,000 is notsignificantly different from the 1987 estimate, which may reflect aleveling off in the long-term decline in the number of farmresidents,'' the report said.   But the report added, ``more than one year of data showingstability would be needed to confirm this pattern.'' Between 1983and 1984 the decline in farm population also appeared to halt butwas then followed by a resumption of loss.   The U.S. farm population peaked in 1916 when it was about 32.5million. It has generally declined ever since.   One of the report's authors, Judith Kalbacher of the USDA'sEconomic Research Service, said the rural figures overall have shownsignificant changes but cautioned the growth pattern since 1986 maybe illusory.   ``When the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census, someof these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban,'' shesaid in a telephone interview. ``Some of the growing areas are goingto be taken out of rural groups, and that will make it look likethere was less rural growth'' than is now being reported.   In the report, rural areas include open countryside and places offewer than 2,500 people that are not in the suburbs of large cities.The large cities and their suburbs, plus places of 2,500 or more,are considered urban.   The farm population consists of people living on farms in ruralareas, but it does not include the relatively few who live on farmslocated in urban areas, the report said. A farm is defined as aplace that sold agricultural products worth $1,000 or more duringthe previous year.   Kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers tocommute greater distances have been important factors in the growth.Families moving to distant suburbs, for example, have helped boostthe annual readings for rural areas.   ``It probably means that a lot of the rural growth that we'reseeing in the mid-decade (of the 1980s) is mostly fringe developmentaround urbanized areas,'' she said.   The report said the largest share of the rural population, 44percent, is in the South, ``which has been the case since the firstcensus was taken in 1790.'' Little change in the regionaldistribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years.   However, the farm population has shown ``marked change'' over thesame period. In 1950, for example, the South accounted for 51.6percent of the farm people, but only 29.6 percent in 1988. TheMidwest, meanwhile, accounted for 50.6 percent last year, comparedwith 32.3 percent in 1950.   Other observations in the report included:   _Farm residents are older, with a median age of 38 years in 1988,compared with 32.2 years for all non-farm people. In 1920, themedian age of farm people was less than 21 years. Non-farm refers tourban plus rural non-farm people.   _Last year 97.1 percent of farm residents were white, and 2.2percent were black, compared with 84.2 percent white and 12.4percent black in the non-farm population. The rest were described as``other'' races.   _About 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older weremarried and living with a spouse in 1988, compared with 56 percentof the non-farm people.   Farm women also had lower proportions of being single, widowed,married with spouse absent, and divorced.   ``This probably reflects a tendency toward increased outmigrationof young farm women as they reach maturity, and outmigration orcessation of farming activities for older women upon loss of theirhusbands,'' the report said.   The fertility rates of farm women of childbearing age were alittle higher than non-farm women. Data for June 1988 showed thenumber of children who had been born to farm women 18 to 44 yearsaveraged 1,533 per 1,000 women. Non-farm women averaged 1,337children per 1,000.</TEXT></DOC>
