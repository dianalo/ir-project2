North said Wednesday he does not want to testify against hisformer boss, ex-national security adviser John Poindexter.   Poindexter, scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22, was ``the only one... who didn't hang Ollie North out to dry'' during thecongressional Iran-Contra hearings, North said at a pre-trialhearing in the Poindexter case.   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene will decide whetherNorth was tainted by Poindexter's immunized congressional testimonyand cannot testify at his criminal trial.   ``This is the fourth Christmas that my family has had its doordarkened'' by the independent counsel's investigation andprosecution of the Iran-Contra affair, North complained.   North ``is not a friendly witness, not to the independentcounsel,'' Greene observed.   But prosecutors need North's testimony.   It was Poindexter who directed North to step into a meeting withcongressmen where he lied about assisting the Contras.   ``Well done,'' Poindexter said in a follow-up computer messageafter the Aug. 6, 1986, meeting.   North suggested Poindexter was unaware of North's false answerswhen the national security adviser, who hadn't attended themeeting, sent the computer message.   At one point during the seven hours of testimony from North thisweek, Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb emphasized that Poindexterhad received a written summary of North's comments before sendingthe computer message. Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congressin connection with the denials about Contra assistance.   North watched as Poindexter tore up a presidential finding onNov. 20, 1986, an aspect of four of the criminal charges againstPoindexter.   North quickly agreed with defense attorney Richard Beckler thathe hadn't actually seen what document Poindexter had torn up.   Iran-Contra prosecutor Michael Bromwich brought out that thedocument destruction was preceded by Poindexter and Northdiscussing the finding. The politically embarrassing document,depicting the Iran initiative as a straight arms-for-hostages deal,referred to knowledge by the Reagan administration of previous armsshipments to Iran.   Entering the fourth year of its investigation, the office ofindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh has been forced to rely on aseries of reluctant witnesses.   Testimony from North's loyal secretary, Fawn Hall, was crucialto prosecutors in proving that North altered documents.   Former CIA employee Glenn Robinette was accused by prosecutorsof giving misleading answers on a witness stand. Yet Robinette'stestimony was critical in the conviction of North for accepting a$13,800 home security system.   This week, North said his perceptions of the Iran-Contra affairhad been influenced by Poindexter's Capitol Hill testimony, givenunder a grant of immunity.   Bromwich suggested North is falsely raising the taint issue sothat he will be disqualified by the judge as a government witnessin the Poindexter case. North denied it, although he acknowledged,``I am familiar with the (legal) concept'' of taint.   North is raising the issue in the appeal of his three felonyconvictions in the Iran-Contra scandal. He contends his immunizedtestimony tainted the government's criminal case against him.</TEXT></DOC>
