State-run media reported earlier that the strikershad been fired.   In a statement, management of the Repair Shipyard said dismissalswere unnecessary since strikers heeded an appeal Wednesday to leavethe shipyard.   It said management will consider the guilt of strike leaderslater and take ``appropriate disciplinary decisions.''   The state-run news agency PAP announced Wednesday night thedirector of the shipyard had fired the instigators of the strike atthe 4,500-worker yard.   ``In view of the imprecise communique concerning the GdanskRepair Shipyard on Polish radio and TV, we would like to inform thatat the appeal of the manager... A small group of strikers left theenterprise and thus there was no need to submit disciplinarydismissals immediately ,'' the statement said.   The management statement, read by Ireneusz Gradowski, editor ofthe official shipyard newspaper, Ostrow, said all workers reportingfor work today were allowed into the yard.   Hundreds of mostly young workers at the Repair and Wisla yardswent on strike Tuesday without the backing of Solidarity leader LechWalesa. The workers were demanding that the government scrap itsplan to begin shutting down the Lenin Shipyard next month.   They ended the strikes Wednesday after repeated appeals fromWalesa and a threat of dismissals from management.   In September, Walesa persuaded strikers to end Poland's worstlabor unrest in seven years in exchange for a government promise tohold talks on ending the country's economic and political crisis andreinstating Solidarity.   But the talks have been repeatedly delayed, with each siderefusing conditions set by the other. One Solidarity demand is thatabout 100 coal miners fired for striking in August be rehired.   The Wisla and Repair shipyard workers went on strike on a dayWalesa had said he might call a nationwide strike alert over thegovernment's announced intention to close the 10,000-worker LeninShipyard in Gdansk on Dec. 1.   But no strike alert was issued, and Walesa later said shipyardmanagers told him that liquidation of the huge complex would takeseveral years.   Soon after hearing Wednesday of the end of the second strike,Walesa thanked the workers for heeding his request.   He argued that striking was counterproductive just now and thatattention should be focused on starting the blocked talks withCommunist authorities.   But he also said: ``We will fight for the shipyard sooner orlater, and we will regain it.''   Solidarity was born at the Lenin Shipyard, where Walesa works asan electrician, in August 1980 during nationwide strikes. It wascrushed 15 months later in a military crackdown.   An undetermined number of workers gave up a strike Wednesdaymorning at Wisla Shipyard, which makes yachts and small river craft,after being promised that those who took part in the strike wouldnot be fired, the yard's strike leader Jan Stanecki said. He saidseveral hundred workers supported the strike.   At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers who rallied Wednesday morningended their strike at around 1 p.m., one hour after management saidthey must leave or be fired, said Krzysztof Kamolak, one of thestrike committee members.   Walesa continues to face resistance from young workers who areimpatient for the proposed talks with the government to begin.   The talks have also stalled over Walesa's refusal to purge fromSolidarity's proposed delegation two people the government hasdeemed extremist, longtime advisers Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron.</TEXT></DOC>
