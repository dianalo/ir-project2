(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Atlantis soared intoorbit Wednesday and its astronauts started the Galileo probe on asix-year, roundabout journey to Jupiter for the closest look yet atthe colossus of the solar system.   ``Galileo is on its way to another world; it's in the hands ofthe best flight controllers in this world,'' said Atlantiscommander Don Williams.   Earlier, concerns about Galileo's nuclear power supply were leftbehind as Atlantis lifted off flawlessly on its mission to carrythe $1.5 billion space probe into orbit on the first leg of itstrip.   After Atlantis had made five trips around the world, Galileo wasejected from the cargo bay by springs at 7:15 p.m. EDT, preciselyon schedule, over the Gulf of Mexico east of Brownsville, Tex. Theshuttle quickly moved away to put distance between itself and thespace probe's rocket.   The ``burn'' was an hour later over Borneo _ first for 2{minutes, then for a minute, 45 seconds _ giving the 6,700-poundGalileo the initial push toward Venus, its first planetaryport-of-call.   ``On time and on schedule,'' said Mission Control.   ``It achieved earth-escape velocity and is now heading outboundtoward the sun,'' said Brian Welch, spokesman for Johnson SpaceCenter in Houston. A spacecraft can escape the Earth's gravity whentraveling faster than 25,000 mph.   The five astronauts spent their first hours in space giving afinal electronic checkout to Galileo, a probe so sophisticated thatone NASA official dubbed it ``the Rolls-Royce of spacecraft.''   ``Everything looks real good,'' said astronaut Shannon Lucid, aone-flight veteran from Bethany, Okla., who had charge of the probedeployment.   The crew members reported a few problems with their own ship asit orbited 184 miles above the Earth. One was with a cooling systemthat might cause them to have to return slightly earlier thanplanned in what a flight director called ``a worst-case scenario.''   ``You looked marvelous going up,'' Mission Control told Williamsas the winged spacecraft reached orbit after two launchpostponements.   ``I feel a lot better,'' said Williams.   Galileo, named after the 17th century discoverer of Jupiter'smoons, will use the laws of physics to get to Jupiter, the largestplanet in the solar system, in 1995. Flying by Venus will cause itto gain momentum and so will two subsequent close encounters withEarth.   Although concern over the Galileo's 49.4-pound plutonium powersupply was argued in court, it drew no protesters to the KennedySpace Center on launch day. Environmentalists had argued that aChallenger-like accident could scatter deadly plutonium-238 overFlorida.   Nothing like that happened Wednesday, and even the weathercooperated. Clouds and rain threatened to halt the launch until thelast minutes of the countdown, but the clouds suddenly dissipatedand the shuttle darted into a bright blue sky, trailing a 700-footgeyser of fire.   The 132-ton Atlantis has a crew of five for the mission thatends Monday with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in Californiaat 2:38 p.m. EDT.   The $1.5 billion mission already was seven years behind schedulewhen Atlantis was grounded by rain at the last minute Tuesday andby a faulty engine computer last week.   ``It feels great,'' said NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk afterliftoff. ``It's been a long time.''   Apart from Lucid, Williams' crew consists of pilot Mike McCulleyand mission specialists Ellen Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz.   The liftoff was the start of a voyage that will take the probeon a looping path past Venus in February, back to within 620 milesof Earth in December 1990 and past Earth again at a 200-milealtitude two years later. The craft will arrive at Jupiter inDeceber 1995 for a two-year orbit.   As part of the mission, a robot will separate from the Galileospacecraft and plunge through Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere.   Scientists hope to gain insight into the birth of the solarsystem by studying Jupiter, which holds original material from thatevent 14 billion years ago. The planet's diameter is about 11 timesthat of Earth and its mass 318 times greater.   The mission originally was to have started in 1982, but moneyran out. Then came the Challenger explosion in January 1986,delaying all shuttle flights for three years and prompting a changein the rocket to propel the Galileo.   The mission originally was budgeted at $425 million. It willclimb to $1.9 billion by the time Galileo finishes a 10-orbit triparound Jupiter in 1997.   The sweeps past Earth and Venus will take advantage of theplanets' gravity to accelerate the spacecraft to the proper speedto reach its distant target. Small onboard motors will fine-tunethe flight path.   The Galileo's electricity will be generated by decayingradioactive pellets of plutonium-238, which causes cancer and deathin humans if inhaled in minuscule amounts.   Environmental activists feared not only a launch accident butalso mishaps during the two flybys. NASA convinced a federal judgethat the plutonium containers could withstand such pressures andthat even if there were a release of radioactivity there would beno appreciable health effects.   The government had hundreds of experts in the launch area _ justin case _ to monitor any radioactive release.   More than 200 guards on foot, in helicopters and boats patrolledthe launch center for protesters who said they might try to stopthe launch by infiltrating the launch zone and sitting on thelaunch pad.   ``We've succeeded in a small way calling attention to theescalating plan to put nuclear energy into space, including in StarWars,'' said Bruce Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace andJustice.   ``The real fundamental point is that people haven't been doingmuch more than ooo-ing and ahhh-ing at the launches. They haven'tbeen considering the moral and ethical issues of what is in thesethings, where they are going and what they are doing.''</TEXT></DOC>
