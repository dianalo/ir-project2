(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   He wielded power like a monarch, theprosecutors say, arrogantly ruling over his fiefdom in thefoothills of the Allegheny Mountains and threatening retributionagainst all who crossed him.   But on Monday, Judge Joseph O'Kicki will sit in an unaccustomedposition in a courtroom: at the defendant's table. The man whopersonified the law in rural Cambria County is now charged withviolating it through bribery and extortion.   O'Kicki's trial has been the talk of central Pennsylvania, afixture on the nightly television news and the local newspapers. Attimes, it has verged on soap opera, with allegations that the judgeordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in hisunderpants or naked, and that he ordered court workers to chop hiswood and feed his dogs.   Acting with O'Kicki's approval, his friends paid for a four-pageinsert in a weekly shopper last week that portrays the judge as thevictim of a sensation-hungry news media and witch-hunting statepolice.   It took a week to pick the jury for the suspended Cambria Countyjudge, and he now insists he cannot get a fair trial even withthose selected.   ``Most of the people who came in there had a fixed opinion,''the gray-bearded, 59-year-old O'Kicki said last week while standingoutside a Central Cambria High School classroom used to interviewjurors.   It's certainly true that feelings run high, although many in thelocal legal community are afraid to discuss him.   ``There was just a tremendous element of fear that pervaded thecourthouse,'' said one attorney who, like many of his colleagues,spoke on condition of anonymity. ``You never knew from one day tothe next whether you were his enemy or friend.''   ``If you go against the judge, he can make it miserable foryou,'' said attorney Edward Peduzzi, who is semi-retired. ``He canmake a good case a bad case.''   Last March, less than a year after O'Kicki's swearing-in aspresident judge of a five-member court, a state grand juryrecommended he be charged with 13 years' worth of violations,including extortion, bribery, lewdness and coercion.   According to the 80-page presentment, O'Kicki peddled hisinfluence so widely and frequently that he even had his secretariesprepare letters outlining his extortion demands and sent out staffmembers to solicit kickbacks.   Such letters were ``indicative of Judge O'Kicki's apparentbelief that in his official capacity he was justified in granting`favors' to those who came before him concerning officialmatters,'' the grand jury wrote.   Among the lesser charges are allegations that he used courthouseemployees to perform personal chores for him and his family.   More serious charges accuse O'Kicki of writing to Laurel Bank,which had a request pending before him on an estate case, demandingthat the bank lower the 14.5 percent interest rate on a personalloan he had taken out.   ``Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with LaurelBank in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider yourrequest,'' said the letter, composed on courthouse stationery.   The bank cut the rate to 11 percent.   O'Kicki claims he was merely informing bank officials that hewould have a hard time being unbiased while the bank remained hispersonal adversary.   The grand jury also accused O'Kicki of forcing his bailiff topay $500 for a promotion that never occurred and of accepting atleast $500 from attorney Richard Green, who told the grand jury hefeared retaliation from a judge who was known to be ``always inneed of money.''   The judge also must defend himself on charges stemming from twoincidents in which he allegedly called his secretaries into hischambers, once wearing nothing but bikini underwear and oncewearing nothing at all.   In his newspaper insert, O'Kicki promised that ``other infoinvolving the secretaries will come out at trial.''   Local attorneys say that, despite the preponderance of charges,O'Kicki will be a formidable opponent for the state prosecutor.   He graduated near the top of his class at the University ofPittsburgh Law School and is known for a keen mind and aphotographic memory.   He was elected to his first 10-year term as a judge in 1971 andre-elected in 1981. In 1983 he was voted president of thePennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400judges.   Although the grand jury recommended 76 charges, most of thosehave been dismissed, withdrawn or combined with other charges.Twenty-seven remain, 11 of which involve public corruption and 16of which involve more private charges.   O'Kicki's trial on Monday concern only the first 11. He will betried on the others later.   The judge insists he will return to the bench _ if he can get afair trial.   ``This is the system I have practiced in, that I have been ateacher and a judge in, and to which I've devoted my entire adultlife,'' he said.   ``I feel in my heart and my mind that I shall be back, that Ishall be vindicated in a court of law.''</TEXT></DOC>
