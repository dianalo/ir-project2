He now aspires to Alan Cranston's seat in theSenate.;    It is ironic that Brown, and others, such as Jesse Jackson,looking for any spotlight into which they can step and express their righteousindignation in respect to one cause or another in order to obtain mediaattention, most recently went to Sacramento to champion the cause of educationin California.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  JERRY BROWN WAS NO FRIEND TO EDUCATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     It is ironic, because during Brown's eight dismal, counterproductive yearsas governor, California's tax effort for public schools plunged from one ofthe highest in the United States to one of the lowest. Brown's firsteducational adviser quit after several months because he felt that educationwas too low on Brown's list of priorities. As I well recall, Brown wasextremely critical of the &quot;high salaries&quot; paid to teachers, indicating thatpeople should be in teaching because of their love for the job, and not forthe money.;    The public school system in California and in the United Statesis the one single greatest asset that we have as a nation, and yet it is oneof our most neglected, the most under-funded, and the most often ignorantlymaligned facets of our society. Education is more harmed than helped withfriends like Jerry Brown.;    -- Wesley K.
