Continued hints of unrest in the Soviet Union gave amildly bearish tone to the mark, which is perceived asvulnerable to trouble in that country. Sterling drew strengthfrom a statement by Britain's chancellor of the exchequerthat ruled out a devaluation of the pound within the Europeanexchange-rate mechanism.</LP><TEXT>   But traders were hard put to identify strong trends inyesterday's market, which was struggling to shake off theaftermath of weeks of holiday-thinned, illiquid conditions.Price action was best described as &quot;sloppy, fussy andrandom,&quot; according to Alfonso Alejo, assistant vice presidentin corporate foreign exchange at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank inNew York.   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4890marks, down from 1.4920 marks late Monday in New York. TheU.S. currency eased to 134.45 yen from 135.40 yen in New Yorklate Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.9440, up from$1.9335. Major markets were closed Tuesday for New Year'sday.   Among the factors weighing on the dollar were the releaseof more discouraging U.S. economic data, the admission byU.S. officials that &quot;recession&quot; may be the correct term toapply to the economy's condition and a stream of prime-ratereductions by U.S. banks.   The dollar hit intraday lows of 1.4848 marks and 133.85yen on news that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Index droppedto 40.4% in December from 41.3% in November. A reading below50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is in decline,while a level below 45 suggests a recession.   But the dollar selling wasn't dramatic. Nor didWashington's reluctant recognition of recession in the U.S.give a major impetus to dollar sellers.   Several U.S. banks cut their prime rate to 9.5% from 10%.Bank of America led the pack, announcing its reduction lateMonday. Yesterday, about three dozen major institutionsfollowed suit. But these moves too, have been widelyanticipated since Dec. 18, when the Federal Reserve cut itsdiscount rate -- at which it lends to banks -- to 6.5% from7%. So while the prime-rate cuts &quot;pulled a little bit ofsupport out of the dollar,&quot; the impact was mild, said JudyRubenstein, vice president at Bank of America in Los Angeles.   The market is already looking for further rate reductionsfrom the Fed, watching tomorrow's U.S. December unemploymentfigure as a possible trigger for such cuts. Should a bleakunemployment report coincide with indications of diplomaticheadway being made in the Gulf, the dollar could tumble,traders said.   Foreign ministers of the European Community are to meettomorrow to consider an independent initiative for diplomaticnegotations with Iraq. The White House indicated that a tripto the Mideast by Secretary of State James Baker is stillunder consideration, although no progress has yet been made.   Continued worry over Soviet politics, meanwhile, spoiledthe mark's allure, particularly against its Europeancounterparts.   Keeping alive the market's anxiety over Soviet upheavalwas Eduard Shevardnadze's remark that he had resigned lastmonth from his post as Soviet foreign minister because hefeared a repetition of military crackdowns that killedhundreds in two Soviet cities in 1989 and 1990. Meanwhile,Estonia's prime minister proclaimed that Estonia will combatany moves by Moscow to restrict the republic's independence.   Buoying the pound was the firm statement from U.K.Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, who ruled out adevaluation of sterling in the European exchange-ratemechanism. He also said interest rates would &quot;be set at alevel that is consistent with our ERM obligations.&quot;   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $389.10 an ounce, down $5.10. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at$388.95 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
