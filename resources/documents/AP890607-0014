At issue are the company's ties to Marc Rich, who fled toSwitzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion,racketeering, mail and wire fraud.   A department official confirmed Tuesday that USDA was examiningRichco Grain Ltd., a Swiss-based company with an office in Stamford,Conn., and payments it received through the Export EnhancementProgram, known as EEP.   The review was started at the request of the chairman of a HouseAgriculture subcommittee, Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who raisedquestions about the company at a hearing earlier this year and onTuesday asked the agency for a full investigation.   Glickman, in a letter to the agency, said ``an unmistakable lineof ownership, control and profit runs from'' Richco Grain to Richthrough a series of subsidiary arrangements.   ``While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lieoutside of the United States can establish but a nominal onshorepresence and qualify to receive EEP bonuses, as appears to be thecase with Richco Grain, I am truly shocked that a fugitive from U.S.justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer dollars,''Glickman said in his letter to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.   Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sellU.S. commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition andthen collect free government surpluses of grain or other commoditiesas bonuses, or subsidies.   Richard Crowder, under secretary for international affairs andcommodity programs, said USDA had started ``checking through whatthe connections are'' between Richco and Rich. He declined toprovide any details on the findings so far.   An official of Richco, Al Church, declined to comment about theUSDA review and would not provide any information about the company.   Glickman asked that USDA's Office of Inspector General determinewhether Richco qualified for the export subsidy program and whetherdepartment eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close anypossible loopholes used by Richco.   Richco has the same telephone number as Clarendon AG, a U.S.subsidiary of Marc Rich andamp; Co. A.G. of Switzerland. Clarendon and theMarc Rich company settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 bypleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than $200 million in backtaxes, fines and other penalties.   Criminal charges against Rich were unaffected by the settlement.The government alleged that Rich and his commodity-trading empirecheated the government out of millions of dollars in taxes through aseries of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled companies.   Richco has received at least $65 million worth of subsidiesthrough EEP, ranking it ninth among grain exporters in the program,according to information supplied to a House committee by USDA. Mostrecently, Richco picked up estimated subsidies of $250,000 for awheat sale to the Soviet Union.   Last month, President Bush approved use of the subsidy programfor the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. Richcohandled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal.Subsidies averaged $8.46 per ton for Richco and four othercompanies, according to USDA.   Glickman, who met Tuesday with Yeutter and Crowder, said Congressmight need to pass legislation disqualifying Richco from the exportprogram unless USDA administratively barred it from receiving moresubsidies.   ``The export enhancement program has undergone some criticismanyway. It would be a shame to jeopardize its future because we'reproviding bonus commodities to a tax fugitive,'' said Glickman.``This is a guy of renowned international bad dealings.''</TEXT></DOC>
