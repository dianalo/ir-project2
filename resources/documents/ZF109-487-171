said BruceBerriman, an engineer for Unisys Corp., a developer and integrator ofelectronic systems in Great Neck, N.Y.andP;  &quot;Not only do you have the power forspectral analysis, but routines are supplied to help integrate FORTRAN, C andPascal code so you don't have to spend time rewriting [code].&quot;andM;&quot;The advantage to MatLab is that it's very close to the root source,&quot; saidJohn Broussard, a senior member of the technical staff for Texas InstrumentsInc., a missile-systems semiconductor manufacturer in Lewisville, Texas.andO;&quot;You can code in MatLab using normal if, else and when statements withoutusing continuation marks.andM;&quot;It compiles the code for you, and the memory requirements grow as you'reworking your problem.andP;  You don't have to allocate memory at the point ofexecution,&quot; he added.andM;According to Bill Taylor, vice president and actuary of Massachusetts MutualLife Insurance Co., of Springfield, Mass., the interpretive language of STSCInc.'s APL*Plus II/386 is both its greatest strength and its greatestweakness.andP;  &quot;While it offers incredible power, that interpretive overhead cancause a memory problem,&quot; he said.andM;Greg Mateja, consulting actuary for Chalke Inc., a software designer,disagreed.andP;  &quot;APL's interpretive nature makes the speed of developmenttremendous.andP;  The package is written under Phar Lap's 386/DOS-Extender runsand takes full advantage of both the 386 and 486 chips' ability to accesslots of memory.&quot;andM;Buyers of each product had differing opinions about the way the packageshandle data.andP;  Many said the packages have room for improvement.andM;Rick Reeves, vice president of engineering for Gardener Systems Inc., atest-machines manufacturer in Fountain Valley, Calif., said the data-handlingcapabilities of Alligator Technologies' Fourier Perspective III fall short.andM;&quot;The biggest problem is that we can't put enough points into the analysisroutine,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Although [the vendor] says you can input 16,000 points,to do that you have to call a separate graphics routine.andP;  Memory limitationsdon't allow you to do everything in one package.&quot;andM;Buyers of DADiSP, from DSP Development Corp., also found data handling moredifficult than expected.andP;  &quot;While the package is very flexible, the biggestshortcoming is that the user is unable to annotate data clearly,&quot; said BillKikendall, director of new business development for Teledyne Gotech, acontrol-systems manufacturer in Garland, Texas.andM;Massachusetts Mutual's Taylor said that although APL's data handling ispowerful, there are shortcomings in the product.andP;  &quot;As opposed to otherlanguages, the data in APL is self-defining,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But, when dealing inmassive models, we've had some trouble.andP;  If you're not careful about memorymanagement, there's a bug in the system that screws things up and causes theprogram to lose line labels.&quot;andM;Although buyers voiced complaints about data handling, they lauded thepackages' graphics and presentation tools.andM;&quot;MatLab's ability to add various toolboxes allows fantastic number crunchingwith very few commands.andP;  Files are easily automated for repetitive tasks, andindividual users are able to customize the package to suit their needs,&quot; saidGraham Douglas, a controls specialist for Delco Electronics, an aerospacesystems manufacturer in Goleta, Calif.andM;According to David Edell, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology in Cambridge, DADiSP's graphical capabilities help his studentsbetter understand the methodology of signal processing.andM;&quot;The graphics display of algorithm results makes it easy to instantlyunderstand and execute a number of simple processes linked together,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;You're able to put a large number of windows on-screen to zoom intodetail.&quot;andM;According to Gardener System's Reeves, the presentation capabilities ofFourier III greatly influenced the purchase decision.andP;  &quot;The thing that led usto buying the package was that in addition to doing analysis, it executes aprofessional presentation of the results while creating a savable file aswell,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;As far as tools, there's a wide variety.andP;  The only thinglacking is a manual scaling routine.&quot;andM;Although buyers of APL*Plus said graphics features were not as much of anissue for their applications, those features were not only adequate, butpowerful.andM;Depending on the application, hardware and software compatibility was more ofan issue for some buyers.andP;  Texas Instruments' Broussard said softwarecompatibility is MatLab's best feature.andP;  &quot;The VAX and PC versions areperfectly compatible,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If you write code in PC MatLab, you caninstantly load it onto the VAX and you're ready to go.&quot;andM;&quot;With APL, I've gotten equally good results on Toshiba, Dell, IBM, AST,CompuAdd, NEC and several 286 no-names,&quot; said Chalke's Mateja.andP;  &quot;What I wouldlike to see is some additional support for networks and connectivity betweenplatforms.andP;  Currently, there's support to some degree, but it would be a bigasset to operate transparently across the network on different operatingsystems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
