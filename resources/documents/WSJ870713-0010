RoseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEG EUROP AMR BABAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In launching a new European travel reservations system with three overseas airlines, Allegis Corp. hopes to establish a new profit center and feed more traffic to its United Airlines unit.    Under their agreement -- jointly announced Friday -- United, British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Swissair will invest $120 million to build a more sophisticated reservations and information system than the Europeans now have.    Analysts applauded the move as a logical and potentially lucrative one for United, whose Apollo reservations system is second in U.S. market share only to the Sabre system of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit. Analysts said both of those systems face lower profit margins from intensified competition from rivals.    Meanwhile, American Air has held talks with a group of European airlines interested in establishing a joint reservation system and has indicated that it is willing to offer sophisticated equipment and that it would be interested in being a partner in the venture.    John R. Zeeman, United's executive vice president, marketing and planning, said he expects the Allegis venture to be profitable in its second or third year of operation and that &quot;it has every opportunity to be as profitable as Apollo is here in the U.S.&quot;    A United spokesman, meanwhile, said that although domestic competition has reduced profit margins for the reservations unit in the past year, &quot;it's still a very high margin business.&quot; The company doesn't break out results for its Covia subsidiary, which includes the Apollo reservations unit.    Profits in the European venture would be split based on ownership shares, which haven't been disclosed. Mr. Zeeman said United's ownership will be &quot;less than a third&quot; of the total, but higher than it otherwise would be because of the value of the Apollo system to the European partners.    In addition to a chance for more profits for its reservations unit, Mr. Zeeman said United sees the venture &quot;as a solid way to continue to build on alliances with the European airlines, since we have no intention to fly to Europe ourselves in the foreseeable future.&quot;    The planned system is being billed as one that will show travel agents schedules and fares from carriers in an &quot;unbiased&quot; fashion. Still, analysts said United stands to benefit as the airlines in the venture feed traffic to one another.    &quot;United has already built up a feed network in Chicago and strong marketing agreements with foreign carriers,&quot; said Hans Plickert of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. &quot;This will strengthen it.&quot;    Allegis shares closed Friday at $92.625, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    United's partners, meanwhile, are getting a step up on a competing group of European airlines planning to start the Amadeus joint reservation system in mid-1989. The United group's venture -- though it has yet to get a name or location -- is slated to start by late 1988.    The competing group is composed of Air France, Lufthansa, Iberia and Scandinavian Airlines System.    Analysts said the Amadeus group has been thinking of buying software from U.S. carriers, but now may be inclined to seek a more extensive link with the reservations systems of American Airlines or Texas Air Corp.    &quot;Since they are at least two generations behind us, one of the ways (for the European carriers to be more competitive) is to buddy up with an American carrier,&quot; said Steve Lewins, transportation analyst at Citicorp Investment Management, New York.    Both European groups plan to use International Business Machines Corp. computers for their core system.    Allegis said its joint venture is unrelated to its attempt to find a partner that could buy as much as a 50% stake in United's Covia subsidiary.    United's Mr. Zeeman said there's more interest in Covia than in the non-airline units Allegis plans to sell. Although interest has come from both foreign and domestic airlines and from others such as computer makers, he said any stake sold to one or more partners probably would total less than 50%.    &quot;We do not wish to lose control of one of the best assets the airline has,&quot; he said.    An American Airlines spokesman said, &quot;What we have told the Amadeus bunch is we would like to participate in their venture at whatever level they would welcome us.&quot;    He said American at a minimum wants to provide the software for the venture and would also &quot;consider being a partner.&quot; The spokesman said Amadeus has told American it expects to make a decision by July 21. </TEXT></DOC>
