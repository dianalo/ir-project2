The two sides haven't had formal talks before, andaccounts vary on how much work awaits them. Sources on theMatsushita side stress that talks to date have beenpreliminary; sources in the MCA camp say the parameters havealready been established by go-between Michael Ovitz,chairman of Creative Artists, a talent agency, who isrepresenting Matsushita.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, it was learned that MCA Music EntertainmentGroup has agreed to form a joint venture with Victor Co. ofJapan Ltd., 51%-owned by Matsushita, to market and distributeall MCA records as well as its Geffen and GRP labels inJapan. Al Teller, chairman of MCA Music, wouldn't comment,but he is said to have been working on the deal -- andanother distribution agreement with West German media concernBertelsmann AG -- months before initial discussions beganbetween MCA and Matsushita.   In the MCA-Matsushita talks, which may begin as late asnext Sunday, numerous issues have yet to be worked out.According to sources close to MCA, the basic terms of thearrangement -- that management will remain in place and thatthe price will be from $80-$95 a share for all of theapproximately 91.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding-- have been worked out. But advisers at the Japaneseconsumer electronics concern are expected to recommend alower price, closer to $60 to $70 a share.   Likely participants in the talks will be representativesfrom the two companies, plus, for Matsushita: Mr. Ovitz;Herbert Allen of the investment advisory firm of Allen and Co.;the law firm of Simpson, Thacher andamp; Bartlett; and a majorinvestment bank -- possibly Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. -- which isbeing retained.   MCA will be represented by Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freresand Co.; Martin Lipton of the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton,Rosen and Katz; and Robert Strauss of the Washington law firmof Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer andamp; Feld. Mr. Strauss and Mr.Rohatyn are MCA directors, and Mr. Strauss is said to haveplayed a key role in preliminary talks.   None of the advisers would comment on the talks. Mr. Allenand Mr. Ovitz worked together on last year's Sony Corp.acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Mr. Ovitz hadnegotiated with Sony to head Columbia, but talks broke down.Hollywood speculates that Mr. Ovitz wants a role in MCA, butpeople close to MCA and Creative Artists deny any immediateplan for him to run the company.   One key issue of the negotiations is said to betax-related. MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, 77 years old, andthe estate of the company's late founder Jules Stein, alongwith various charitable trusts which Mr. Wasserman controls,hold about 12% of MCA stock at an extremely low cost basis.Capital gains and estate taxes could be extensive if theacquisition takes place.   Individuals close to the situation say negotiators wouldseek an arrangement under which this tax bite could bedeferred, perhaps through some non-cash component or othermechanism -- such as a premium or specially -- createdsecurity. The remaining shareholders would be paid in cash.This could complicate the acquisition structure, but taxexperts say a solution probably could be found.   The meeting was originally planned for this weekend. Butthe Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, and the fact that a keyMatsushita player reportedly would have had to return toJapan by Wednesday, postponed the plan. In addition,&quot;Everybody just needed more time to get all the numberstogether,&quot; one source said.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday MCAstock closed at $59 a share, down $2.25 a share, buffeted byconflicting reports of the meeting schedule.   The MCA-Victor Co. music pact is designed to solve astrategic weakness for MCA: It lacks internationaldistribution for its music outside the U.S., Canada and theU.K. Instead, it contracts with a unit of Time Warner Inc.for distribution. MCA wants its own piece of this growing $20billion business and wants to develop its own roster ofoverseas artists.   MCA and Geffen's agreements with Time Warner expire inApril and January, respectively. Mr. Teller wouldn't commenton either agreement, but it's known that since MCA acquiredGeffen Records for 10 million shares of MCA stock in March,Mr. Teller has been pursuing new distribution agreements. AVictor Co. spokesman was unavailable for comment.   Separately, shareholder suits seeking class action statushave been filed in Delaware Chancery Court and in Los AngelesSuperior Court, charging MCA with denying shareholders thechance to get a higher price for their shares by spurningother suitors, negotiating preferentially with Matsushita,seeking to preserve MCA management and entering talks whenthe shares were trading at the comparatively low price of$34. MCA didn't comment on the suits.</TEXT></DOC>
