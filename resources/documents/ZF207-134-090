 The seminar's sessionswere to focus on automation and telecommunications challenges in the 1990s.andM;The task of a keynote speaker is not an easy one.andP;  In half an hour you areexpected to survey a topic; a dozen other speakers will take an hour and ahalf each to focus on a specific area of the same topic.andM;In my attempt to cool the soup, I kept in mind that trying to predict actualchanges in technology more than five years into the future never isproductive.andM;&quot;Long-range planning,&quot; as Peter Drucker has pointed out, &quot;does not deal withfuture decisions, but with the future of present decisions.&quot;andP;  It's enough toknow how things are changing and what the trends are.andP;  With this in mind, Inarrowed my scope to those changes that would have the greatest impact onsenior government managers during the early 1990s.andM;For all practical purposes, the years we are interested in are 1989, '90, '91and '92 -- what will become known affectionately as the Bush years.andP;  As I seeit, senior government officials face three challenges during this period.andM;The first is a financial challenge, a consequence of the economic crisis thatour nation appears to be in; the second, a political challenge, resultingfrom the changeover from the Reagan to the Bush administration; and thethird, a technical challenge, caused in part by the scale of governmententerprise and in part by technological innovation.andM;I will discuss the financial challenge here; I'll leave the political andtechnical challenges for later columns.andM;As a child I was taught not to use four-letter words, especially those thatbegan with the letter d.andP;  Unfortunately, as an adult I cannot always avoiddoing so, and this is one of those times.andP;  The four-letter word I am going touse is &quot;debt.&quot;andM;Till Debt Do Us PartandM;The U.S.andP;  debt at the end of fiscal year 1988 was $2.6 trillion -- equal tomore than half our annual gross national product.andM;Last year the federal government spent $151.7 billion just for the use of themoney represented by that debt and only $17 billion for the use of computersand telecommunications, including all planning, development, operations andmaintenance costs.andM;The budget deficit for fiscal 1988 -- the difference between what was spentand the revenues collected -- was $155 billion.andP;  A little fudging is going onhere because the real operating budget deficit was $255 billion.andM;That's the amount our gross debt went up during the year.andP;  It is offset inthe budget by a surplus of $100 billion dollars generated by the trust funds-- Social Security, Medicare, retirement, highways and airports.andP;  However,these are funds that represent future commitments.andM;The Gramm-Rudman deficit target for last year was $150 billion.andP;  So we missedit.andP;  In the current fiscal year the target is $136 billion.andP;  Officially, theestimated deficit in the 1989 budget is $162 billion, but the estimate hascrept closer to $170 billion.andP;  So we'll miss the Gramm-Rudman target againthis year.andP;  What about 1990?andM;The deficit target for 1990 is $100 billion, and the Bush budget projectsthat the fiscal 1990 budget deficit will come in below that limit.andP;  However,that projection depends upon improved economic growth and declining interestrates.andP;  And this just doesn't seem to be in the cards.andM;We certainly have had a growing economy.andP;  The GNP for 1988 was $4.7 trillion,up 7.8 percent over 1987.andP;  But the real growth was only 3.8 percent.andP;  Annualgains in productivity in the non-farm business portion of the economy haveaveraged only 1.9 percent snce 1981 and were below that at 1.4 percent lastyear.andM;The problem?andP;  Inflation -- too much money for the goods available.andP;  In thelast 12 months the consumer price index has risen 4.7 percent, the largestincrease on an annual basis in almost five years.andP;  Currently U.S.andP;  plants areoperating at 84.4 percent of capacity.andP;  Historically an 85 percent rate hasbeen accompanied by a rapid increase in inflation.andM;Wheel of FortuneandM;The cure?andP;  Interest rates have to go up to reduce the availability of money.andO;And they have.andP;  The federal funds rate, the interest rate on loans betweenbanks, has risen in the last year by 3 percentage points to 9.5 percent underthe open market operations of the Federal Reserve Board.andM;In January major banks raised their prime rate to 11 percent, the highest ithad been since 1984, and then raised it again two weeks later to 11.5percent.andP;  Now the Fed, citing inflationary pressures in the economy, hasincreased its discount rate from 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent, the highestlevel in three years.andM;The result?andP;  The cost of goods will go up.andP;  Spending will go down.andP;  And thefederal budget deficit will increase.andM;An increase in interest rates directly increases budget costs as thegovernment has to pay more for the use of the money it borrows.andP;  Itindirectly reduces the revenues the government collects by slowing down theeconomy and reducing producer and consumer spending.andM;The net result is an increase in the deficit, unless agency budgets are cutor new sources of revenue are found.andP;  Most conservative projections would add$30 billion to $50 billion to the current 1990 deficit estimate.andM;The axe is going to fall, have no doubt about it.andP;  The only question is thedegree of severity.andP;  In the worst-case scenario, the economic crisis will beaccompanied by additional increases in interest rates by the Fed to combatinfation, followed by a general economic recession leading to a second roundof cuts.andM;How much of a cut the IRM budget will take is anybody's guess.andP;  Five percent?andO;Ten percent?andP;  Twenty percent?andP;  Whatever it is, it will not fall evenly oneveryone, and unfortunately it will not be the result of a wholly rationalprocess.andP;  Add to this the fact that the current workload will not go away andnew needs will have to be met, and it's not a pretty picture.andM;What to do about it?andP;  The usual.andP;  Get ahead of the power curve.andP;  Re-examineyour strategic plan, as we're talking about the long pull here.andM;Ask yourself whether your goals and objectives are realistic in this newenvironment.andP;  What about your priorities and options?andP;  How should theychange?andP;  Are there new options you should consider? Then take whatever stepsare necessary to adjust your project schedules and resource allocation.andM;No one ever said challenges had to be fun except on TV game shows.andP;  But theyare not the end of the world, either.andP;  You might take comfort, as I have onoccasion, in the words on an old Scottish ballad: &quot;I am wounded but I am notslain,/ I'll lay me down and bleed a while and rise and fight again.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
