The verdict marked the second stage of a two-partprosecution of the biggest single-bank, drug-money launderingcase in U.S. history. In January, BCCI pleaded guilty tomoney-laundering charges and agreed to pay a $15.3 millionfine.</LP><TEXT>   The defendants found guilty in Tampa, Fla. -- Amjad Awan,41 years old; Syed Aftab Hussain, 30; Akbar A. Bilgrami, 35;Sibte Hassan, 31; Ian Howard, 39; and Colombian businessmanRudolph Armbrecht, age unavailable -- were also convicted ofvarious individual counts of money laundering, from three inthe case of Mr. Hassan, to 20 each in the cases of Messrs.Hussain and Bilgrami. The jury acquitted Mr. Hassan of threecharges of money laundering. Mr. Armbrecht is the individualwho didn't work for BCCI.   Conviction on the conspiracy charge carries a maximumsentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine; each ofthe money-laundering charges carries a maximum penalty of 20years imprisonment and a fine of either $500,000 or twice thevalue of the property laundered, whichever is greater.   Judge William T. Hodges said a sentencing date will be setlater this week. In the meantime, he ordered that the six menbe held without bail.   The convictions come in the wake of an incident last weekthat might well have resulted in a mistrial. After the jurybegan deliberations July 18, one juror made at least onephone call to individuals allegedly connected to the Medellindrug cartel in Colombia, according to courthouse documents.The juror obtained the phone numbers from an address bookthat federal agents had seized from Mr. Armbrecht and thatthe prosecution had entered in evidence.   The incident came to light after the juror mentioned thecall to other members of the jury; the husband of one of theother jurors later tipped off the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation. After a hearing Thursday, Judge Hodgesdismissed the juror and ordered the remaining 11 members ofthe jury sequestered to complete their deliberations.   In a prepared statement, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzmansaid he was &quot;extremely satisfied&quot; with the verdict. Defenseattorneys couldn't be reached for comment.   BCCI released a statement expressing &quot;sympathy to thefamilies&quot; of the six men, and adding that the crimes were&quot;contrary to the express, written policies of BCCI&quot; andoccurred without the knowledge of the bank's management orboard.   ---   SECURITIES INDUSTRY prepares to fight Florida arbitrationlaw.   The industry is gearing up to challenge a Florida law thatgives investors the option of bringing their disputes withbrokers to arbitrators not affiliated with the securitiesindustry.   Florida is the first state to enact a law that requiresbrokers to allow their customers the freedom to take theirdisputes to the American Arbitration Association, anindependent forum, or to arbitration panels subsidized by theindustry. AAA president Robert Coulson hailed the law as asafeguard for the small investor's &quot;right to select.&quot;   But a spokesman for the Securities Industry Associationsaid the trade organization will file a challenge to the lawin federal court by early August. William Fitzpatrick, theSIA's general counsel, says the Florida law interferes withbrokers' contractual rights and conflicts with the FederalArbitration Act. He cites a recent U.S. Supreme Courtdecision that the Federal Arbitration Act prohibits statesfrom singling out securities arbitration agreements fortighter controls than other business contracts. In thatruling, the high court knocked down a Massachusettsregulation similar to Florida's law.   &quot;We feel we can block the Florida law on the same groundsthat we successfully blocked the Massachusetts law,&quot; Mr.Fitzpatrick says.   Mr. Fitzpatrick says the SIA's more than 600 members canuse any arbitration panel to settle disputes. But theorganization is opposed to the government demanding thatbrokers write their agreements to provide freedom of choicefor investors, he adds.   It is standard practice for investors opening brokerageaccounts to sign an agreement promising to arbitrate disputesrather than file lawsuits.   In its ruling early this year, the U.S. Supreme Court letstand a federal appeals court decision that quashed theMassachusetts regulation that prohibited securities firmsfrom requiring customers to sign arbitration agreements.   Increasingly, investors are asking courts or legislatorsto give them greater choice in choosing forums forarbitration with their brokers. Early this month the New YorkCourt of Appeals, the state's highest court, gave investorsthe right to use the American Arbitration Association toresolve disputes over broker agreements if their contractsspecifically allow for it.   Mr. Fitzpatrick says that at least nine other states hadcontemplated a law similar to Massachusetts but backed offafter the regulation was declared unconstitutional. He saysCalifornia is in the early stages of considering a billsimilar to Florida's.   George Friedman, a lawyer with the American ArbitrationAssociation, predicts the Florida law will survive courtscrutiny. He says the Massachusetts plan was a regulation,not a law, and attempted to limit brokers' rights to insiston arbitration to resolve customer disputes.   ---   LAW FIRM GETS $750,000 IN FEES in unusual libel case.Nixon, Hargrave, Devans andamp; Doyle, a Rochester, N.Y., law firm,collected the money from the unsuccessful plaintiff in alibel suit against Gannett Co.   The case was filed in 1978 by Hammer DeRoburt, thenpresident of the tiny Pacific Island nation of Nauru. Mr.DeRoburt, one of Nauru's founding fathers, claimed that aGannett paper, the Pacific Daily News, falsely linked him toa $675,000 loan to a political faction in the MarshallIslands.   In 1985 a jury found that the article had been defamatorybut did not constitute actual malice. Mr. DeRoburt wastherefore not entitled to damages. U.S. District Judge SamuelP. King ruled that Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., wasentitled to legal fees from Mr. DeRoburt. The case was triedunder a combination of English law, which is used by Nauru,and U.S. law. Under English law a losing party is typicallyrequired to pay the winner's legal fees.   After Mr. DeRoburt unsuccessfully appealed the verdict andJudge King's decision on the legal fees, the parties settledon the $750,000 payment. One of Mr. DeRoburt's lawyers,Thomas N. Charchut of the Santa Monica, Calif., law firm ofHaight, Brown andamp; Bonesteel, called the settlement &quot;acompromise both sides could live with.&quot;   John B. McCrory, of Nixon, Hargrave, said fees billed byhis law firm came to over $1 million.   ---   Ellen Joan Pollock contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
