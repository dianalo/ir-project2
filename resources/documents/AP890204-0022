Sen. John Warner, R-Va., declined on Friday to say what theinformation dealt with. But other sources indicated it concernedTower's personal life, and specifically alcohol and women.   ``It's just another chapter in an ongoing investigation,'' Warnersaid. ``I don't attach any more significance to this chapter than toany other.''   He said an FBI report on the subject should reach the committee``on Monday and ... we can proceed to a vote Tuesday or Wednesday.''   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe FBI was looking into allegations concerning ``Tower's behaviorat a party last year in Houston.''   CBS News reported that the allegations involve an alleged liaisonin Houston between Tower and a woman from an Eastern bloc nation,along with an allegation of excessive drinking in the past year.   According to ABC News, the new allegations include a report froman Air Force colonel which said Tower had 14 separate liaisons withwomen while he headed the U.S. negotiating team in Geneva afterleaving the Senate.   The committee had been expected to vote Thursday to recommendSenate confirmation of Tower, but that was postponed after theemergence of the new allegations.   Tower, meanwhile, sought to dispel any impression of an embattlednominee, meeting for about two hours at his Jefferson Hotelresidence with five people likely to be named to deputy posts at thePentagon.   He later issued a statement, saying the meeting had beenscheduled for a week ``and had nothing to do with the proceedingsbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee.''   Editorials in Defense News and Army Times, two widely circulatedindustry publications, called for Tower to withdraw his nomination.The editorials are scheduled to appear in Monday's editions.   Army Times, a 49-year-old independent publication, said Tower'spublic position ``has been so compromised by the agonizing processby which he was nominated and is being confirmed ... that he cannotbe the strong spokesman the Defense Department needs now.''   Defense News, also an independent publication, suggested Tower'slinks to defense consultants is the most troubling aspect of therecent confirmation process, and said, ``There is ample reason todoubt whether Mr. Tower is the man for these times.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Ourfeeling is he will be confirmed. Whenever you have a candidate whois undergoing this kind of scrutiny there are always things thatturn up. We will await the final judgment.''   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said he did not think it was ``necessary at this time towithdraw the nomination.''   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing beforehis nomination. In divorce papers filed two years ago by his secondwife, Lilla Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``maritalmisconduct.''   Tower, who has been divorced twice, is now single.</TEXT></DOC>
