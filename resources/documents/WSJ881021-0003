After days of deadlock, lawmakers late yesterday began an urgent effort to craft a tax package before Congress adjourns at the end of this week. The House conferees proposed that their Senate counterparts accept a bill that would raise $4.1 billion over three years and extend expiring tax breaks for one year.    &quot;The House has given us a serious proposal which the Senate should seriously consider,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), who is managing the bill in the Senate.    Conferees had dug in their heels over ending a tax break for defense contractors and the size of the tax increase in the legislation.    Last night's House offer showed movement from last week's offer of a $4.5 billion tax bill, which is significantly less than the $7.5 billion bill passed by the House. Senate staffers this week have made informal offers that remain below $3.9 billion. The Senate-passed bill would raise $2.5 billion in taxes over three years.    The House proposal calls for a tax increase on defense companies and other long-term contractors. Currently, they can defer 30% of taxes on a long-term contract until after the contract is completed. The offer would reduce the amount of taxes that could be deferred to 10% of the amount owed on income from a contract. The House bill originally called for a total repeal of this tax-deferral method.    This offer would increase long-term contractors' taxes $1.3 billion over three years. It would exempt homebuilders from the tightening on the so-called completed-contract method of accounting.    The Senate and the House are in agreement over how to raise as much as $3 billion in taxes. Both bills would increase taxes by an acceleration in corporate estimated tax payments, a restriction on the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations, and curbs on life-insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters.    The tax increase would pay for tax benefits sought by groups ranging from authors and artists to multinational corporations and mutual-fund shareholders. The bill also would make technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law. </TEXT></DOC>
