The modelling concept is outlined. Five scenariosfor future world energy use, which is the major uncertainty, and therelated production of carbon dioxide, chloro-fluorocarbons and othergreenhouse gases, are considered. Modelling results for the global meansurface temperature change, due to CO/sub 2/ and for the combined effectof CO/sub 2/ and the other greenhouse gases, over the period 1860 to2100, are given. The policy implications of the predicted unprecedentedtemperature rise are discussed in terms of how great a temperature increasecan be tolerated, and how and in what areas of human activity gas emissionscan be reduced.
