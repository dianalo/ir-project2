Onereport said 30 people were killed.   Doren Miller, general manager of Radio Cayman, told TheAssociated Press that a lawyer in Jamaica called the radio stationand said at least 30 people had died across Jamaica as the brunt ofthe storm lashed the Caribbean island Monday afternoon.   Miller said his station's correspondent in Jamaica reported thathundreds of families had fled their homes because of risingfloodwaters.   The hurricane pounded Kingston on the southwest coast andMontego Bay and Ocho Rios on the north.   In Cuba, 115,000 people were evacuated from their homes as aprecaution in five eastern provinces when Gilbert's winds brushedthe island, said Prensa Latina, the government news agency.   Authorities in Kingston said looters stole mattresses from ahospital, the roof was torn off a home for physically handicappedpeople and a firefighter was hurt when heavy winds blew him off histruck.   Bob Sheets, director of National Hurricane Center, in CoralGables, Fla., said his office was in touch with a meteorologicaloffice in Kingston as the eye of the storm passed over city. On theleading edge of hurricane, winds gusted to 140, he said.   ``Then on the trailing edge of the eye wall, there were windsjust as strong and they said they couldn't see anything outsidetheir windows,'' Sheets said. ``It was quite a frighteningexperience for them.''   At midnight EDT, Gilbert was centered near latitude 18.5 north,longitude 79.5 west, or 135 miles east-southeast of Grand Cayman,the National Hurricane Center reported.   ``The hurricane is moving toward the west near 17 mph,'' thecenter said in a statement. ``This motion will bring the center ofthe hurricane over or near Grand Cayman in the early morning hoursTuesday.''   The Cayman Islands, south of Cuba, are flat and have fewsheltered areas, the center said.   In Kingston, Jamaica's capital with 750,000 people, the initial30-minute shock of the storm let up as the hurricane's eye movedacross the city. Skies brightened, winds died and people waited foran hour before the second blow arrived.   Amateur radio operators in the United States said they receivedreports of buildings collapsing and severe power outages acrossJamaica.   Bill Carpenter of Shelby County, Ala., said he monitored areport from a radio operator staying at the Wyndham Hotel sevenmiles east of Montego Bay ``and the building was shaking badly byhis description.''   ``They've been without power in Jamaica since last night for themost part and telephone service has been real, real spotty,''Carpenter said.   Another ham radio operator went off the air after reportingstorm damage at his house near Montego Bay, Carpenter said.   ``When he got back on the air, he said most of his house haddisappeared,'' Carpenter said. ``It's been a heart-rendinglistening to them all day.''   Amateur radio operator Martin P. Maragni of Coconut Creek, Fla.,said he also received transmissions indicating widespread and heavydamage in Montego Bay.   ``They've had the airport with severe damage,'' Maragni said ina telephone interview Monday night. ``They had to evacuate theMontego Bay meteorology center approximately about 8 o'clock thisevening (EDT), so I've been unable to get any reports out ofthere.''   Bob Ebaugh, a National Hurricane Center forecaster, said somehangar roofs blew off at the international airport in Kingston andsome runway aircraft were damaged. All flights were canceled on theisland.   Amateur operator Rafael Estevez in Hialeah, Fla., said he hasbeen speaking with other radio operators in the Dominican Republic,Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica since Monday morning.   Estevez also said he heard a report from Kingston saying the topof a city hospital was blown off and the main television station onthe island was not broadcasting.   ``People were telling me they saw trees and stuff flyingaround,'' said Estevez. ``But so far I haven't heard of anyonebeing killed.''   He said reports from the Dominican Republic and Haiti indicatewidespread blackouts and some damage along coastal areas from highwaves.   Heaviest damage reports were in Jamaica, however.   ``The eye of the storm moved right lengthwise down the island,''Sheets said at 5 p.m. EDT. ``They're getting five to 10 inches ofrain (in Jamaica), and so the mudslides, flash floods and all ofthat will be continuing for the next six to eight hours.''   Sheets said the Cayman Islands has a dearth of sheltered areas.``They're very flat, there's not a lot of places people can go toget refuge,'' he   Miller said at 9 p.m. EDT that Little Cayman had been evacuated,as well as lower-lying areas of Grand Cayman.   ``Everyone is waiting with bated breath,'' Miller told TheAssociated Press in Puerto Rico in a telephone interview. ``It iscalm here at the moment but we are expecting to take the brunt ofit.''   Cayman Island airlines was running flights every two hours toMiami to evacuate as many people as possible before the hurricanehit, said airline spokesman Claude Chisolm.   Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issuedMonday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the CaymanIslands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for theDominican Republic.   In Kingston, a policeman suffered a broken leg when a fence fellon him, another resident was injured when a wall collapsed and afirefighter answering an emergency call was hurt when the wind blewhim off the fire truck, the disaster office reported.   The Mona Rehabilitation Center for paraplegics reported its roofhad been blown off.   Police reported people were stealing mattresses from theUniversity Hospital and there was scattered looting in the Kingstonsuburbs of Westchester, Portmore and St. Catherine.   There was an unconfirmed report that prisoners had escaped fromKingston's Gun Prison.   Jamaica House, the office of Prime Minister Edward Seaga, wasthe crisis center. Seaga said in a radio interview that he wouldseek international aid.   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home and boarded uptheir windows.   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, said 40 mph winds fromthe hurricane prompted authorities to evacuate more than 115,000people from the eastern provinces of Tunas, Guantanamo, Santiago deCuba, Granma and Holguin.   The region is about 90 miles north of Jamaica at its closestpoint. More than 80,000 head of livestock in that area also weremoved to safer ground, the agency said.   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken precautions butappeared safe.</TEXT></DOC>
