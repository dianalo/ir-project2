The Frigga variety has a standard karyotype and the T{sub506} line is characterized by translocation of the nucleolar organizer,which leads to a reduction in the number of nucleoli observed in thetelophase. The results of the investigation of rRNA synthesis in vivoand of the activity of RNA polymerase I in isolated nuclei revealed theabsence of differences between the two barley forms. They have establishedthat the genes of ribosomal RNAs possess greater sensitivity to digestionby DNAase the authors compared to that of the total nuclear DNA. Theyconclude that the translocation of one of the nucleolar organizers causesa delay in the appearance of its activity during the telophase, thisnot changing the expression of the rRNA genes in the subsequent stagesof cell development.</TEXT></DOC>
