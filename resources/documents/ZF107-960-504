Department of Defense.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DOD Expected to Add Records Of Inactive Reserve to RCASandM;Defense Department officials are likely to expand the scope of thelong-planned Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS) to include records on300,000 inactive reserve members.andM;The move, which comes in response to recent directives to streamlineinformation management, probably will not affect the final RCAS request forproposals, due to be released Dec. 29.andP;  But it could result in RFPamendments.andM;In September, the Army's Major Automated Systems Review Council (MAISRC)rejected a plan to include new automation for the personnel managementsection of the Army Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN) in the $1.2 billionRCAS program.andM;RCAS is a wartime mobilization and peacetime administrative system that willprovide microcomputing and advanced communications capabilities at 5,000reserve facilities worldwide.andP;  Most of those facilities are unit-leveloperations.andP;  They control about 700,000 active members of the Army and AirNational Guards, as well as the National Guard Bureau.andM;In a Nov. 15 memo, William D. Clark, acting assistant secretary of the Armyfor manpower and reserve affairs, raised the question of whether a separatesystem for ARPERCEN might duplicate RCAS.andP;  Clark said he had asked the RCASprogram manager &quot;to re-examine the question of including ARPERCEN's personnelmanagement needs with the RCAS.&quot;andM;Justifying his action, Clark cited the Oct. 4 directive from Donald J.andO;Atwood, the deputy Defense secretary, telling DOD officials to integrate&quot;multiple management information systems&quot; whenever possible.andP;  Clark quotedAtwood's directive that &quot;DOD should not expend resources to develop andmaintain multiple systems or software to meet the same functionalrequirements.&quot;andM;In an interview, Clark said Army officials expect that some of ARPERCEN'sneeds will be met through the Personnel Electronic Records Management System.andO;Officials expect to issue an RFP for that $80 million program early nextyear.andM;But Clark also said that one of the most critical ARPERCEN functionsaffecting reservists, the processing of merit points soldiers accumulatetoward retirement, likely could be accomplished through RCAS.andM;The retirement points are scheduled to be reported to ARPERCEN through RCAS.andM;Clark's memo asked Brig.andP;  Gen.andP;  J. Ronald Carey, the RCAS program manager, tofactor ARPERCEN's automation needs into the final RCAS RFP.andP;  But Clark saidhe did not think the RFP would be changed before it is released later thismonth.andM;Carey would neither confirm nor deny that he is pursuing Clark's request, buthe did say more automation needs might be added to the RFP by amendment.andM;ARPERCEN, in St. Louis, is a headquarters-level facility that maintainsrecords on individual ready reservists.andP;  National Guard Bureau spokesman JohnHoffman said the records cover inactive soldiers no longer drilling or on thepayroll.andM;&quot;These are people who might be subject to mobilization in time of war,&quot; hesaid.andM;Brig.andP;  Gen.andP;  Jack Pellici, commander of the Army's Personnel InformationSystems Command, said ARPERCEN &quot;is in dire need of automation help.&quot;andM;Pellici's command develops and maintains Army personnel systems, a missionthat includes support of ARPERCEN.andM;Officials said most of the retirement points records kept at ARPERCEN areincorrect.andP;  Most data is at least 90 days old because of a cumbersometape-drive system, they said.andM;Carey said the RCAS program would need another large storage device and nomore than 2,000 more terminals for ARPERCEN.andM;The draft RFP calls for RCAS to use as many as 20,000 microcomputers, likelyto be obtained through the Desktop III requirements contract.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
