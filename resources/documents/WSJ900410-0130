AST Research Inc. plans to unveiltomorrow in Tokyo a computer that mimics NEC's PC-9801, amachine that has captured more than half of Japan'spersonal-computer market, which is the world's secondlargest, after the U.S.   The Irvine, Calif., company's move is radical, and risky,because it centers on a product that is made purely for theJapanese market and so won't be sold in the U.S. While manyJapanese companies take that tactic -- NEC and others peddlepersonal computers in the U.S. that they don't sell at home-- no foreign company has so directly assaulted NEC'snear-monopoly of the Japanese market. NEC's machines havebecome de facto standards in Japan's boomingbusiness-computer market, much as International BusinessMachines Corp.'s personal-computer architecture is a de factostandard in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   The AST machine also could become a test of how open theJapanese market really is for competitive U.S. products.Japanese trade officials often complain that U.S. companies,including computer makers, don't make products that matchJapanese shoppers' buying patterns. Among U.S. computermanufacturers, only IBM has managed to garner even a fractionof the Japanese personal-computer market. Apple ComputerInc., which sells a Japanese-language version of itsMacintosh computer, has only a minuscule share. NEC softwarewon't run on either of those company's machines.   A U.S. Commerce Department official will accompany AST atthe unveiling to show official support, says Joan McEntee,deputy undersecretary for export at the department. CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher &quot;feels very strongly that it's agood example of a product meeting the Japanese on their ownground,&quot; she says. &quot;It's a good test of the supposed newopenness of the Japanese market.&quot;   AST says it has consulted with NEC about its cloning plansand that NEC isn't opposed to the new competitor entering itsturf. AST expressed confidence that patent questions won'tarise.   An NEC spokeswoman in Tokyo said, &quot;We do know AST is goingto make an announcement, but we're not too sure what kind ofmachine it will be.&quot; She added, &quot;I don't think we wouldcomment on other companies' strategies.&quot;   Only one company, Japan's Seiko Epson Corp., has clonedthe NEC machine. While unabashed about copying U.S. computertechnology, the Japanese have politely shied away frommimicking each others', leaving a rare, nearly uncontestedJapanese market.   &quot;It's one of those huge, untapped markets for aggressiveoverseas companies,&quot; says Safi Qureshey, AST's president andchief executive officer.   Copying another bit of Japan's export strategy, AST plansto undercut NEC's pricing while offering more features. Andin an unusual reversal, it will offer the machine for saleunder Japanese brand names, much as Japanese TV makers sellsets to U.S. vendors for sale under American labels. AST saysit is negotiating with several concerns, includingconsumer-electronics giant Sharp Corp., that are interestedin selling the machine.   The new AST machine, called the AST Dual SX/16, will runthe thousands of software packages written for the NECcomputer as well as programs written for the IBM personalcomputer. The machine uses Intel Corp.'s 80386SXmicroprocessor, a set of chips made by Japan's Kawasaki SteelCorp. and some internal software written by a small Japanesecompany named Tomcat Computer Corp.   The move comes from a scrappy company that has beenpushing heavily overseas as the U.S. personal-computer marketgrows more crowded. AST runs Russian-language advertisementsin the Soviet Union and pushes overseas sales in India andother foreign markets that are largely ignored by many U.S.personal-computer companies. AST, with sales of $456.6million in the year ended June 30, 1989, expects the Japanesemachine to become a major revenue contributor.</TEXT></DOC>
