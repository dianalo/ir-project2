Judge Stanley Sporkin's decision was a major victory forthe government and marked the first court test of federalregulators' contentions that Mr. Keating wove elaboratebusiness schemes to transfer funds from Lincoln to its parentcompany, American Continental Corp. The parent in turn paidmultimillion-dollar salaries to Mr. Keating, who is itschairman, and other officials. The government has said thefailure of Lincoln, one of the biggest thrift debacles ever,could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.</LP><TEXT>   In a scathing 50-page decision, Judge Sporkin rejected Mr.Keating's contention that overzealous and incompetentgovernment regulators harassed him for five years after hebought Lincoln in 1984, and acted illegally in seizing thethrift in April 1989.   &quot;It is abundantly clear that ACC's officials abused theirpositions with respect to Lincoln,&quot; Judge Sporkin wrote,adding: &quot;Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to alooting of Lincoln. This was not done crudely. Indeed, it wasdone with a great deal of sophistication.&quot;   Government officials said that yesterday's clear victorycould help in a civil fraud suit the government has filedseeking $1.1 billion from Mr. Keating and other Lincolnexecutives. Some proceedings in that suit have been delayedby the action before Judge Sporkin. &quot;I think the ring isclosing around Mr. Keating,&quot; said William Seidman, chairmanof the Resolution Trust Corp., which filed the civil suit.The Office of Thrift Supervision also has filedadministrative charges against Mr. Keating and five otherofficials, seeking $40.9 million.   Mr. Keating sued the government last year, contending thatthe regulators had a vendetta against him for making riskyreal estate and junk-bond investments outside the pale of thetraditional home mortgages held by thrifts. Judge Sporkinbrushed those claims aside and said that in a series of realestate and securities transactions, American Continental'sactions in bleeding Lincoln of funds was like &quot;an adulttaking candy from a helpless child.&quot;   The decision came on a motion by the government to dismissthe suit. Beginning in December, Judge Sporkin held more than30 days of hearings, examining several of Lincoln'stransactions.   In a statement yesterday in response to the decision,American Continental said it was &quot;reviewing all of itsoptions&quot; and had &quot;no comment at this time.&quot;   In June, on the last day of the hearings, Mr. Keating saidhe expected to appeal if the decision went against him.However, perhaps heartened by Judge Sporkin's relentlessquestioning of government witnesses during the proceedings,he said: &quot;I have full confidence that what this judge doeswill be a fair and honest opinion, based on everything thathe's done. I realize I may be hanging myself with thatcomment, but I believe that.&quot;   Judge Sporkin, a former enforcement director at theSecurities and Exchange Commission known for hisoutspokenness, had harsh words for Lincoln's accountants, inparticular Arthur Young andamp; Co., and attorneys who signed offon complicated deals that he said had no &quot;economicsubstance.&quot; The judge said: &quot;The system of accounting thatexists in the United States is in a sorry state&quot; if Lincoln'saccountants were correct in approving the accounting ofcertain deals.   However, Judge Sporkin also praised one Arthur Youngaccountant, Janice Vincent, for refusing to allow Lincoln torecord a profit, which Mr. Keating was &quot;desperate&quot; for, in acomplicated securities transaction. Arthur Young is now partof Ernst andamp; Young.   A spokesman for Ernst andamp; Young had no immediate commentyesterday. When Arthur Young's actions were criticized incongressional hearings last year, representatives of the firmsaid their audits were &quot;responsibly and professionally done.&quot;   In one transaction in March 1987, for instance, JudgeSporkin found that Lincoln provided $14 million in financingto sell 1,000 acres it owned outside Phoenix, Ariz., thoughLincoln knew the buyer couldn't repay the debt &quot;in anyrealistic time frame.&quot; But because the book value of the landwas $3 million, Lincoln was able to record a gain of $11million and $250,000 in accrued interest.</TEXT></DOC>
