Syrian artillery shells continued to besiege the coast of theChristian enclave north of Beirut today. Police said two people werekilled and seven wounded.   The deaths raise the toll to 404 people killed and 1,558 woundedsince fighting erupted March 8 between the mainly Christian troopsof Gen. Michel Aoun's Lebanese army and Syrian-backed militiamen.   Tension also heightened amid reports that 42 Christians werekidnapped in Moslem sectors after Syrian-backed Moslem forces lifteda land blockade of the Christian heartland two days ago.   The An-Nahar newspaper reported the kidnappings, and Aoun'scommand said the report was true. But police said they knew about noabductions.   Syria's barrage of Christian ports is to prevent Aoun fromreceiving armaments, but Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri declaredtoday that the Christians on Thursday received a shipload ofSoviet-designed Frog-7 missiles and T-54 and T-55 tanks from Iraq.Berri, leader of the mainstream Amal militia and Syria's closestally in Lebanon, was speaking in Damascus, after meeting withLebanese Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt.   Aoun's command refused to comment on the report he has acquiredthe missiles, which have a range of 43 miles and can carry warheadscontaining 1,210 pounds of explosive.   Berri charged the Christians will deploy the new armamentsagainst Moslem forces.   ``They're not to threaten Syria or any other country,'' he said.``They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of thenational coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties.   Syria this week charged Christian forces received six Frog-7missiles in April and demanded they be removed because they couldhit Damascus if fired from Christian-held positions in mountainsnortheast of Beirut. The mountains are 40 miles from Damascus.   Berri claimed Christian missiles are ``aimed at my house, thehouse of Walid Jumblatt and at the Syrian headquarters'' in Beirut.   He said he has not officially asked Syria for the missiles and iswaiting for President Hafez Assad to return from his summerresidence ``in order to put this request to him.''   ``The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they cannot,or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advancedweapons from any source,'' Berri told reporters.   A statement from his Amal militia published by Beirut newspaperssaid acquisition of the missiles would ``lead to a destructivecatastrophe that will not spare areas in east or west Beirut.''</TEXT></DOC>
