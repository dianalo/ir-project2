A review by the Treasury Department of deposit insurance wouldunearth a suggestion that created an uproar in Congress when it wasoffered last month by the outgoing Reagan administration.   The phrasing in the budget document released Thursday is vague,but trade association officials interpret it as a warning that theadministration will take another look at lowering the $100,000insurance limit on bank and thrift institution accounts.   Treasury's study would include an examination of ``incentives formarket discipline ... (and) methods to reduce the scope of depositinsurance coverage and the resulting liability of the'' FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., the budget document says.   ``With that kind of language, we'd read it as a red flag,'' saidDiane Casey, director of regulatory affairs for the IndependentBankers Association of America. ``We'd oppose any lowering ofdeposit insurance.''   Many conservative economists argue that deposit insuranceencourages banks and Sandamp;Ls to take risks because depositors have noincentive to monitor the health of their institution. Others arguethat reducing deposit insurance could destabilize the financialsystem and contribute to bank runs.   Bush outlined most aspects of his Sandamp;L program on Monday. Itincludes using taxpayer dollars and higher industry insurancepremiums to pay for the $126 billion Sandamp;L crisis. He also proposedrestructuring the regulatory system.   In his nationally televised speech to a joint session ofCongress, the president called on the legislators to enact theproposal within 45 days and pledged ``insured depositors willcontinue to be fully protected.''   ``We must not let this situation fester,'' he warned, adding,``Any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by majorreform. Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring.''   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a member of the Senate BankingCommittee, called Bush's appeal to complete a bailout bill in 45days ``a short timetable legislatively'' but said it is notimpossible.   ``We'd be moving mighty fast to do that, but it can be done,''said Rep. Tom Bevill of Alabama, a senior Democrat on the HouseAppropriations Committee.   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, had said in an interview earlier this week he hoped tohave the bailout legislation reported out of his committee by thefirst week of March.   The hint in the budget on the scope of deposit insurance comesonly a month after the Reagan administration suggested in its finaleconomic report that curtailing deposit insurance ``would restoremuch-needed discipline to the system.''   The Treasury Department, only an hour after the release of theReagan report, issued a statement disavowing the suggestion.However, later it was reported that the department had consideredreducing deposit insurance coverage in the early stages offormulating Bush's Sandamp;L policy.   The passage in the Bush budget could also be interpreted asmeaning an investigation of curbing the so-called ``too big to failsyndrome.''   Regulators have been unwilling to allow large banks to fail,fearing a possible ripple effect on the financial system. So, inmany cases, they have been protecting all deposits, even thoseexceeding the $100,000 insurance limit.   Edwin Dale, an adviser to budget director Richard Darman, saidthe Treasury study was intended ``to find out whether the basicconcept of deposit insurance should be changed.''   However, neither the president, nor other administrationofficials, nor materials given to reporters on Monday, made anyreference to examining a reduction in the scope of deposit insurance.   Bush's budget also proposed ``incentives to attract more privatecapital (to Sandamp;Ls) from banks and other financial service firms,'' anapparent reference to lifting barriers to the acquisition of Sandamp;Ls bybank holding companies.   The president would also give financial regulators the power toset risk-based insurance premiums ``if further study demonstratesthe feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.'' Currentlyevery bank pays the same insurance premium regardless of the safetyor riskiness of its activities.</TEXT></DOC>
