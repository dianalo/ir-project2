The &quot;extreme right wing,&quot; says Mr. Wright, is now running White House Central American policy. What crazed and maniacal policy can these three be referring to? It is President Reagan's suggestion this past week that the Sandinista Directorate hold an election before 1990. Incredible indeed. Political reality in Washington now holds that asking a country such as Nicaragua to hold an election sometime in the next two years is an &quot;extreme right-wing&quot; idea. </TEXT></DOC>
