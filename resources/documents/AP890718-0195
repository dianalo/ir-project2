Baker III that the idea of a ``greater Israel'' should beabandoned, National Public Radio said Tuesday.   Baker's exhortation, contained in a speech May 22, was attackedby friends of Israel in Congress.   The network said the president endorsed Baker's call on Israel togive up any idea of annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan River,occupied by Israeli troops since 1967, to stop new settlements inthat territory and to reopen Palestinian schools.   At the White House, spokesman Robert Hall declined to sayanything about a letter from the president but added: ``That allsounds like U.S. policy.''   Reporter Daniel Schorr said the letter, sent at the end of June,reiterated U.S. opposition to creating a Palestinian state, supportfor secure Israeli borders, an undivided Jerusalem and assurancethat Israel's military advantage over its Arab enemies would be kept.   He added it was designed, at the suggestion of 11 leaders in theU.S. Senate, to help Shamir resist opposition within his own LikudParty against the plan for an election in the disputed area ofrepresentatives who would then negotiate with the Israeli government.   Shamir then made a speech adopting conditions urged by otherLikud leaders: continued Jewish settlements in the area and a ban onparticipation in the election by Palestinians living in Jerusalem.   The conditions brought a threat from the Israeli Labor party topull out of Israel's coalition government.</TEXT></DOC>
