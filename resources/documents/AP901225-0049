(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foy David Kohler, a career diplomat and theU.S. ambassador to Moscow during the height of the Cold War, hasdied at age 82.   Kohler, who was present for the 1959 ``kitchen debate'' betweenSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and then-Vice President RichardNixon, died Sunday at Jupiter Hospital. His home was in Juno Beach.   ``His loss is a great loss,'' said former Secretary of StateDean Rusk. ``Foy Kohler was one of our greatest professionaldiplomats. He was a lifelong member of the foreign service. Heserved with great distinction.''   Kohler was ambassador to the Soviet Union from August 1962 toNovember 1966.   He was considered a member of the realist school ofinternational politics, which emphasized the importance ofmilitary, economic and political power in world affairs.   Kohler took his first post as vice consul in Windsor, Ontario,in 1931. Later assignments took him to Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece,Egypt, England and Turkey. He also toured Vietnam, Pakistan andBolivia on fact-finding missions for U.S. aid programs, and heserved as director of the Voice of America.   From 1941 to 1945 he served as assistant chief of the StateDepartment's Division of Near Eastern Affairs.   Kohler first went to Moscow in January 1947 as first secretaryof the U.S. Embassy. He was there when Khrushchev and Nixon toureda model American kitchen during a 1959 American exposition inMoscow. Khrushchev became angry, and the ``kitchen debate'' betweenhim and Nixon drew international attention.   President John F. Kennedy tapped the Russian-speaking diplomat -then assistant secretary of state for European affairs - to becomeambassador to the Soviet Union in 1962.   Shortly after he arrived in Moscow in his new post, the Cubanmissile crisis erupted and brought the world to the brink of war.   Nonetheless, Kohler respected Khrushchev.   ``You couldn't help but like him just as an individual,'' heonce said. ``He was a shrewd peasant and he loved to traderepartee. He had a quick wit. It's true that Khrushchev -especially with his de-Stalinization speech - shook up the societyand greatly eased the terror that had prevailed under Stalin. Onthe other hand, Khrushchev was a true believer in Bolshevism.''   After leaving Moscow, Kohler was undersecretary of state forpolitical affairs for a year.   He retired in 1967 and then spent almost 11 years as a professorat the University of Miami's graduate center for AdvancedInternational Studies.   The hospital said Tuedsday that Kohler died after a long illnessbut did not release details.   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis. Funeral arrangements werepending.</TEXT></DOC>
