The bill, approved by voice vote, also would give theagency &quot;cease and desist&quot; power to stop alleged wrongdoers.Moreover, it contains a provision that would better protectpenny-stock investors.</LP><TEXT>   The legislation, expected to be approved soon by theHouse, is expected to allow the SEC to handle more casesin-house through its own administrative law judges ratherthan in federal courts. While the administrative law judgesare forced to use identical burdens of proof as federal courtjudges, they are seen by some as being more sympathetic tothe SEC.   That has made some defense lawyers skittish that clientswon't get the same treatment they can expect now. But the SECdismisses that complaint, contending that the bill wouldallow the agency to better tailor the punishment to thecrime. &quot;It is not an unreasonable conclusion for people tosay the enforcement program in the '80s has uncovered enoughproblems that we need more flexibility and to add someeconomic deterrence,&quot; said SEC enforcement director WilliamMcLucas. &quot;My view is that's what this bill does.&quot;   The bill was proposed by the SEC two years ago in aneffort to fill what it saw were holes in its enforcementprogram. The legislation also would give the agency theauthority to ask courts to bar people from serving publiccompanies as officers and directors if they have violatedsecurities laws.   Under the fining authority, the agency could imposemaximum penalties of as much as $100,000 per violation forindividuals, $500,000 for corporations or the amount gainedthrough illegal activities.   The penny-stock provision would give the commission thepower to take enforcement action against penny-stockpromoters, many of whom are not registered with thecommission. Promoters found to be wrongdoers could be barredfrom being associated with a brokerage in the future. Thebill also features new risk-disclosure requirements tellingcustomers the nature and level of risks in the penny-stockarea. Those requirements also extend to the way brokers dealwith their customers.   The penny-stock provision also would give the SEC thepower to place new limitations on so-called blank-checkpools, which solicit investor funds without identifying theuse of the proceeds. Moreover, the bill instructs the SEC topress exchanges to create an improved pricing system forpenny stocks.   Separately, the Senate Banking Committee unanimouslyapproved the nomination of Richard Roberts to the SEC. Mr.Roberts is a lawyer who was a former aide to Sen. RichardShelby (D., Ala.), a member of the committee. Mr. Roberts,who was nominated to fill a Democratic slot on thecommission, is expected to be approved soon by the fullSenate.</TEXT></DOC>
