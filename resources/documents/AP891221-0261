Home heating oil for January delivery shot up 4.05 cents to79.81 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Subsequent contract months also posted strong gains.   Demand for heating oil has surged as temperatures plunged inrecent days. Several oil companies _ including Exxon USA, MobilCorp. and Texaco Inc.'s Star Enterprise _ have reported temporaryshortages of the fuel at some of their Northeast terminals.   James Fiedler, an oil market analyst with E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc., said the cold was responsible not onlyfor the jump in heating oil prices, but in gasoline futures as well.   Unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 2.41 cents to 55.63cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange, with later months alsorising sharply.   Fiedler said traders were anticipating weather-related problemsat gasoline refineries in Texas, where freezing temperatures haveforced plant shutdowns in previous years. Refinery closings couldmake gasoline supplies tighter.   Crude oil prices, which often rise along with refined productprices, continued that trend Thursday. West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 31 cents to settle at $21.52 a42-gallon barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
