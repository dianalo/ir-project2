No Easy Answer   ----   By Karen Slater   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/28/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><MS>FINANCIAL (FIN)</MS><IN>LIFE INSURANCE (INL)INSURANCE (INS)</IN><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   People trying to sell you life insurance often havedefinite ideas about the type of policy you should buy.   You may hear about the wonders of &quot;cash-value&quot; coverageand the horrors of competing &quot;term&quot; policies -- or the exactreverse. It all depends on a particular salesperson's beliefsand, often, how they are compensated.</LP><TEXT>   But consumers should be wary of salespeople who presentthis product choice as a battle between good and evil. Thetwo types of life insurance are indeed very different. Termpolicies, which are generally cheaper to begin with, providea payment upon death. Cash-value policies not only provide adeath benefit, but also include a savings component. But&quot;there is no absolute right or wrong&quot; for all buyers, saysJames H. Hunt, an actuary and a director of the NationalInsurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va.   Among the factors life insurance buyers need to consider:how much they can afford to spend, how long they will needthe coverage and how much effort they want to devote tobuying insurance.   Term insurance is the simpler product. The buyer pays apremium for coverage for a particular &quot;term,&quot; typically oneyear. And the insurer promises to pay a certain death benefitif the policyholder dies during that period. There is nopayment if the holder lives, just as there is no paymentunder a homeowner's policy if the house isn't damaged. Apolicyholder simply renews term coverage.   Term insurance is very different from homeowner'sinsurance, however, in that one's premium can be counted onto soar at some point in the future. Insurers demand biggerpremiums from older policyholders because the odds of theirdying that year are greater.   Consider the initial premiums that nonsmoking men ofdifferent ages would pay for $100,000 of term coverage fromPrudential Insurance Co. of America: at age 30, $155 a year;at age 40, $173; at age 50, $251; at age 60, $710; and at age70, $2,516.   In contrast, cash-value products like &quot;whole&quot; life and&quot;universal&quot; life are generally designed so the premiums don'tchange. But those premiums can be as much as 10 times theinitial premium a buyer would pay for a term policy with thesame death benefit.   The buyer of a cash-value policy essentially overpays inthe early years to build up a tax-advantaged savings accountthat helps pay the higher insurance charges later on. If theholder drops the policy before death, the person gets to walkaway with some of the accumulated savings, called thepolicy's &quot;surrender value.&quot;   A buyer's budget is clearly the first consideration inselecting the type of life insurance. Getting enough coverageto provide for one's family &quot;is the most important thing,&quot;says Kenneth A. McClure, a vice president at USAA Life andamp;Health Insurance Co. in San Antonio, Texas. &quot;If the only wayyou can afford to do that is to buy term, buy term.&quot; And terminsurance may be convertible into a cash-value policy, withsome qualifications.   Agents may have a financial incentive to steer buyers awayfrom term insurance, though. Because sales commissions aremuch higher on cash-value life, an agent might earn moreselling a cash-value policy with a smaller death benefit thana term policy with a larger one.   And what if the buyer can afford either term or cash-valuecoverage? Many fans of term insurance say consumers do betterto &quot;buy term and invest the difference -- &quot;that is, to investfor themselves the dollars they save by not pickingcash-value life. A closer examination suggests that this istrue if insurance is needed only for a few years, but that itis not true when the need is much longer.   Term is the clear winner for short periods because mostcash-value policies have big upfront charges that largely goto pay the insurance agents' sales commissions. A person whodrops a cash-value policy after a year or two might get onlya small fraction of the sum paid in.   Fully half the whole-life policies written today willprobably be dropped within seven years, according to theindustry's Life Insurance Marketing andamp; Research Association.That's a key reason that the National Insurance ConsumerOrganization generally recommends term insurance overcash-value. &quot;Far more money has been lost&quot; through earlysurrenders than through insurance company failures, says Mr.Hunt, who recently wrote a new version of the group'sinsurance guide.   Still, Mr. Hunt and others say cash-value coverage is theright choice when coverage will be maintained for decades oruntil death. Most term policies can't be renewed past age 70.And cash-value life &quot;can be a good investment in the longrun,&quot; largely because of favorable tax treatment, Mr. Huntsays.   Insurers typically pay interest on the savings componentof a cash-value policy. The growth in a policy's savingscomponent isn't taxed until the policy is surrendered; noincome tax at all is due from a policy's beneficiaries if thepolicy is held until death. Cash-value policies can also workas a &quot;forced savings&quot; vehicle for people who don't have thediscipline to save on their own.   Figure on a minimum holding period of between seven and 20years for cash-value policies to be a better deal than thestrategy of &quot;term and invest the difference,&quot; according toVirginia Applegarth, an insurance specialist with TFCFinancial Management in Boston.   For instance, the estimated breakeven is 14 years in theaccompanying chart that Ms. Applegarth and Boston insuranceagent James A. Margolis prepared for a 45-year-old manlooking to buy $250,000 of coverage (see accompanying chart-- WSJ June 28, 1991). (Ms. Applegarth notes that thebreakeven is based on numerous assumptions, and warns thatsuch comparisons can be easily manipulated to produce adesired result.)   People inclined to buy cash-value policies should stronglyconsider dealing with the few companies that sell policiesdirectly without big sales commissions, says Peter C. Katt,an insurance consultant in West Bloomfield, Mich. Pickingthose policies should produce a quicker breakeven -- and itcertainly minimizes the financial pain if circumstanceschange and the coverage is dropped early on. Mr. Kattrecommends buying cash-value policies with low commissionsdirectly from USAA Life and Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. ofLincoln, Neb.   One difficulty for many people is gauging how long theirlife insurance needs will really last. Coverage is rarelyneeded past retirement age, consumer groups and some otherssay.   But Richard Hall, a vice president of Northwestern MutualLife Insurance Co., Milwaukee, says: &quot;It's our feeling thatlife insurance in most all situations is truly a permanentneed.&quot; In retirement, for instance, he says a person maystill want insurance to pay off a home mortgage upon death orto pay estate taxes.   How to proceed? Mr. Katt suggests that the ability tocontinue cash-value coverage in one's later years is a reasonto pick cash-value when the two types of life insuranceotherwise appear quite close in a breakeven analysis. Thecash-value product &quot;just gives you more flexibility&quot; lateron, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
