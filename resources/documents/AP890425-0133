(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight U.S. servicemen were remembered fortheir sacrifice Tuesday, nine years after they died in a desert inIran while trying to rescue American hostages.   On a brilliant, blue morning on a hillside in Arlington NationalCemetery, the men who died at Desert One were honored in a ceremonyby friends, family and some of those they were trying to save.   ``They gave their lives trying to secure my freedom _ that isthe ultimate sacrifice,'' said former Navy Chief Warrant OfficerJoe Hall, one of the 52 Americans who were taken hostage in TehranNov. 3, 1979, by Iranians and held for 444 days.   The rescue mission was attempted by an all-volunteer militaryteam on April 25, 1980. After the mission was abandoned, threeMarines and five Air Force servicemen died when a helicopter and atransport plane collided in Iran's Great Salt Desert.   Six former hostages, including former Ambassador Bruce Laingen,joined relatives of the dead servicemen for the ceremony sponsoredby No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization that aids thefamilies of victims of war and terrorism.   They placed a wreath at a marker honoring the eight soldiers,and three yellow roses at the nearby grave of the three who areburied together at Arlington.   ``This is a wonderful ceremony _ it makes me feel better,'' saidElizabeth Price of Bethesda, Md., aunt of Sgt. John D. Harvey ofRoanoke, Va., who at age 21 was the youngest of those killed on themission.   ``I'm very proud of him,'' she said. ``He gave his life forthese men and the country. He was dedicated to what he was doing atthe Marines. He believed in them.''   Charles Whitehouse, assistant secretary of defense for specialoperations and low-intensity conflict, said the deaths reminded thenation that ``the courage to try must be matched by the capabilityto succeed.''   ``Here we were found wanting,'' he said, adding that themilitary since then has improved special forces preparedness.</TEXT></DOC>
