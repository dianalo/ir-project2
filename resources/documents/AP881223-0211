The agreement announced Thursday calls for jointly developing16-megabit D-RAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips, byexchanging technology.   A 16-megabit DRAM can hold 16 million bits of information,equivalent to about 64 pages of an English-language newspaper, and16 times the size of the 1-megabit DRAMs commonly used in today'shigh-performance computers.   ``Each company will have access to the other's D-RAM technologyas it relates to 16-megabit development,'' Hitachi said in astatement.   ``We are very happy to enter into this relationship withHitachi,'' William P. Weber, Texas Instruments' executive vicepresident, said in a statement. ``Both of our companies bring uniquetechnological skills in D-RAMs.''   He said the agreement, which only covers technology related to16-megabit chips, will be expanded to cover other future generationtechnology. The three-year agreement is extendable, a Hitachiofficial said.   Kazuo Kimbara, Hitachi's group executive, said, ``This agreementcombines the 16-megabit development efforts of two of the world'sleading semiconductor technology companies.''   Toshiba Corp. and Motorola Inc., both leading chip makers, signeda similar agreement in May 1987. The two firms formed a jointventure in Fukushima, northern Japan, to produce 256-kilobit DRAMsand 1-megabit DRAMs.   Analysts said each company will benefit from the agreement, withTexas Instruments gaining Hitachi's leading technology in chipproduction while offering its accumulated know-how in buildingmicroprocessing units.</TEXT></DOC>
