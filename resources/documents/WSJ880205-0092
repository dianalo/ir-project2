The government reduced duties on U.S. corn to 46 Canadian cents (36 cents) a bushel from 1.10 dollars (86 cents) a bushel, effective immediately.    The Canadian Import Tribunal, a government agency, had recommended reducing the duties even further, saying that it would be in the &quot;public interest.&quot;    The government said quarterly corn prices rose as much as 46 Canadian cents a bushel above what they would have been if the duty hadn't been imposed about 15 months ago.    The countervailing duty was imposed to offset subsidies that U.S. corn growers were found to be receiving under various U.S. government programs. The Tribunal found that imports of the subsidized corn were injuring Canadian corn producers.    Since then, Canadian manufacturers of corn syrup, starch and other corn products complained that the duty had backfired, pushing corn prices up too steeply.    Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin said he believed the new duty rate would still ensure that Canadian corn producers are protected from &quot;negative effects&quot; of U.S. subsidized corn.    In Washington, a spokeswoman for the National Corn Growers Association said the ruling was &quot;a step in the right direction. However, (we) feel there never should have been any duties on U.S. corn.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
