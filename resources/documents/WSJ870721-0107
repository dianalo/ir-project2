The apparel company said its board unanimously rejected a $340 million proposal from Rosewood Financial Inc. Earlier this month, Rosewood, a Dallas-based investment company controlled by the Caroline Hunt Trust, proposed paying $22 a share for the approximately 80% of Phillips-Van Heusen shares it doesn't already own.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Phillips-Van Heusen shares closed at $24.875, down 12.5 cents.    &quot;Now is just not the time to sell the company,&quot; said Lawrence S. Phillips, Phillips-Van Heusen's chairman and president. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Phillips-Van Heusen's investment banker, will study financial alternatives and report to the company later this month, the company said.    Analysts said the board's move makes it more likely that Phillips-Van Heusen will proceed to arrange a leveraged buyout, a move the company is said to have mulled in recent years.    With Phillips-Van Heusen's stock trading above the amount offered by Rosewood, the possibility of a sweetened bid or other suitors makes a buyout by management more likely, said Eileen Gormley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;Over the years, they have indicated their intention to remain independent, and with a leveraged buyout, at least the company would stay in the hands of the current management,&quot; she said, adding that a reorganization or recapitalization also is possible.    Other analysts suggested, however, that the company simply is attempting to attract a higher bid. &quot;It was a smart move; now the board can sit around and wait for a higher offer,&quot; said Edward Johnson, director of Johnson Redbook Service, a division of Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc. in New York. Mr. Johnson said a leveraged buyout probably would be &quot;too big a chance&quot; because the company would have to &quot;worry about interest from debt.&quot;    Mr. Phillips declined to say whether the company is considering a buyout or what other steps the company might take. No competing bidder has emerged.    In Dallas, a spokesman for Rosewood Financial declined to comment on the rejection of its bid.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors purchases a concern in a transaction financed largely by debt. Ultimately the debt is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    Phillips-Van Heusen makes clothing under such brand names as Van Heusen and Cacharel. Earlier this month, the company agreed to sell its tailored clothing unit, Joseph andamp; Feiss Co., and four specialty retail stores to TJFC Inc., a newly formed company led by two directors. Joseph andamp; Feiss's brands include Cricketeer, Geoffrey Beene and Country Britches; the four clothing retailers were Hamburger's, Kennedy's, Harris andamp; Frank and Juster's.    In a release, Mr. Phillips called the company's prospects &quot;extremely bright,&quot; and said it will continue to consider potential acquisitions actively. The recent sale of Joseph andamp; Feiss &quot;has focused our business and we are beginning to see the results,&quot; Mr. Phillips said.    In its first quarter ended May 3, Phillips-Van Heusen's net income jumped 21% to $4.6 million, or 73 cents a share, from a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
