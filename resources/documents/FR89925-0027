The Final Regulatory ImpactAnalysis describing the options considered in developing this rule is availableon request from the above named individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export marketsand, therefore, has been determined to be ``not major.'' This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR 3015, subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovermental consultation with State and local officials. The reporting and recordkeeping provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507 <T3>et seq.</T3>) contained in this rule have been approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under clearance number 0572-0062. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 0.7 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(OMB andplusmin;0572-0062),.

When that isaccomplished, these Bulletins will be rescinded. On August 18, 1988, REA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> proposed rule 7 CFR part 1765 at 53 FR 31346,Telephone Materials, Equipment, and Construction_Telephone Program, regardingthe requirements and procedures to be followed by REA telephone borrowersfor the purchase and installation of materials and equipment and the constructionof telephone facilities with REA loan funds. In the proposed rule REA invitedinterested parties to file comments on or before September 19, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Comments and recommendations were received from the National TelephoneCooperative Association (NTCA); Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., (TDS),the parent company of 72 telephone systems which have received financingor are eligible for financing from the REA; American Telephone and TelegraphCompany (ATandamp;T); Mr. James R. Ebbitt, Assistant Inspector General forAudit, Office of Inspector General, United States Department of Agriculture;and, filing as a group, the United States Telephone Association (USTA),the National Rural Telecom Association (NRTA), and the Organization forthe Protection and Advancement of Small Telephone Companies (OPASTCO).The comments are summarized as follows: Several respondents commented that a 30-day comment period is not reasonable,a 60-day comment period should be granted for proposed agency regulationsof this magnitude. <T3>Response</T3>_The 30-day comment period was selected because of thedeadline imposed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, PublicLaw 100-203. Several respondents commented that the proposed rule is deficient on severalpoints: First, it was claimed that REA is attempting to restrict fundingfor a purpose permitted by the Rural Electrification Act. Second, as aresult of the wording of the proposed rule, many requirements are placedon engineers, contractors or other involved parties, who are not borrowers.<T3>Response</T3>_First, this regulation does not address the criteriafor loan purposes or amounts of funds to be included in a loan. These areaddressed in 7 CFR part 1745. This regulation addresses only the requirementsand procedures for accomplishing the purposes provided for in the approvedloans. Second, several sections have been changed to place the requirementson the borrowers and not on the architects, engineers, contractors, orother parties. Several respondents commented that intermingling advice and requirementsunnecessarily creates confusion and regulatory burdens for both borrowersand REA. <T3>Response</T3>_REA is committed to the elimination of unnecessary requirementsand advice for borrowers. REA believes, however, that it is appropriateto include advice in regulations when it will improve communications, preventproblems, or otherwise further effective program administration. One respondent objected to the requirements for use of standard forms ofcontracts. They recommended that these be suggested form, only and be modifiedto allow greater flexibility and more freedom for borrowers and suppliers.They proposed a series of amendments to REA contracts. <T3>Response</T3>_There are many reasons for using standard forms of contract.Standard forms are designed to comply with applicable Federal laws andregulations. They assure that the project is built to specifications andprovides adequate loan security. Most parties are familiar with them. Theyare readily accepted by borrowers and contractors in all States and territorieswhere REA lends. Their use promotes efficient and economical constructionof facilities to the benefit of rural subscribers. The use of nonstandardcontracts could lessen these benefits and increase the complexity and costof program administration, resulting in delays. One respondent recommended that timeframes be specified for REA responseon borrower submissions of documents, such as plans and specifications,contracts, and amendments. <T3>Response</T3>_REA is committed to responding in a timely manner toall documents and correspondence submitted, but because of seasonal variationsin workload it is not possible for REA to state in regulations timeframesfor document processing. Several respondents commented that the regulation contains requirementsthat relate to REA forms and that these forms should be published withthe rule. <T3>Response</T3>_Virtually all borrowers, contractors, engineers, andequipment suppliers are familiar with REA's forms. The use of some formsis required in more than one regulation and it would be too costly to reviseseveral regulations each time a form is changed. The forms are availablefrom REA upon request. <T3>Section 1765.1(d)(3)</T3>_Several respondents commented that it isinconsistent with the RE Act for REA to withhold approval of the borrower'smethod of procurement and plans and specifications if, in REA's judgement,they will not effectively and efficiently further the extension or improvementof telephone service in rural areas or if they present unacceptable loansecurity risks to REA. The loan documents require borrowers to provide area coverage; to followREA engineering and construction standards; and to procure materials andequipment and construct facilities by the contract method, unless otherwiseapproved by REA. The subsection has been revised to state that approvalwill be withheld if the proposed method of procurement or Pandamp;S do notconform to REA engineering criteria or construction standards. The referenceto effectively and efficiently furthering rural telephone service has beendeleted. <T3>Section 1765.2</T3>_One respondent commented that central office equipmentalso provides call origination functions. <T3>Response</T3>_The definition for Central Office Equipment has beenrevised accordingly. Several respondents criticized the definition for Engineer. <T3>Response</T3>_New definitions for Architect and Engineer have beenincluded. Several respondents commented on the need for ``interim financing'' tobe defined. <T3>Response</T3>_The definition for Interim Financing has been included.Several respondents commented that the term ``unbalanced bid'' should bebetter. <T3>Response</T3>_The term ``unbalanced bid'' has been redefined in andSection;1765.2 of the final rule. <T3>Section 1765.3 (c) and (d)</T3>_Several respondents commented thatit is unnecessary to require the borrower and GFR to determine if an amendmentto the LD is needed and obtain approval of such amendment. <T3>Response</T3>_Section 1765.3 (c) and (d) state the procedure for decidingif the contemplated construction is consistent with the approved LD. Actualloan construction is rarely exactly as it was proposed in the LD. REA mustdetermine if the borrower's desired construction is sufficiency consistentwith the LD to qualify for financing under the loan. The most expedientway to determine this is for the GFR to meet with the borrower and reviewthe construction plans, as required by andSection; 1765.3 (c) and (d). <T3>Section 1765.5(c)</T3>_Several respondents commented that no objectivecriterion is provided by which a borrower can demonstrate it has the capabilityto perform major construction by the force account method. <T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been revised to specify REA's criteriafor approval of the borrower to perform major construction by the forceaccount method. One respondent commented that conditions for force account constructionshould be eliminated because they are not required by the Act and wouldlimit access to REA funds. <T3>Response</T3>_This subsection does not limit REA funds. The loan documentsspecify that construction shall be by contract unless otherwise approvedby REA. The subsection has been revised in the final rule as discussedabove to set forth REA's criteria for approval to use the force accountmethod. <T3>Section 1765.6 (c) and (d)</T3>_Several respondents commented thatthese subsections should deal only with what REA will finance, and notcover general  requirements for purchase of materials and equipment. Onerespondent commented that subsection (c) should be amended by replacingthe word ``purchased'' with the word ``financed'' because REA controlswhat it finances but not what a borrower purchases. <T3>Response</T3>_Subsections (a)-(d) have been revised in the final ruleto reflect the suggested change. <T3>Section 1765.7(b)</T3>_Several respondents commented that 7 CFR part1762 listing the REA forms of telecommunications contracts has not beenpublished. Thus, there is no opportunity to comment on the appropriatenessof a majority of the actual requirements contained in 7 CFR part 1765.<T3>Response</T3>_7 CFR part 1762 final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 2, 1988. Copies of the contract formsare available as set forth in the CFR. REA is open to suggestions for revisionof its forms. <T3>Section 1765.7(f)(2)</T3>_One respondent commented that this subsectionshould permit the borrower and its vendor to negotiate the terms of thecontract. <T3>Response</T3>_This would make sealed competitive bidding virtuallyimpossible. It would invalidate the borrower's and REA's price evaluationdata. The borrower's and REA's attorneys would have to review every contract.This would consume the resources of borrowers, contractors, and REA. One respondent recommended that the requirement of a liquidated damagesprovision in every contract be deleted. <T3>Response</T3>_Although it is required that all contracts have a liquidateddamages provision, the borrower determines the liquidated damages amountto be specified. This amount can range from zero to whatever amount theborrower can justify. The contractor is not permitted to change the specifiedamount in a bid. <T3>Section 1765.8(a)(1)</T3>_Several respondents commented that it isunnecessary to state that the GFR usually attends the bid opening. <T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been revised to require the borrowerto notify the GFR of the bid date selected and invite the GFR to attend.<T3>Section 1765.8(a)(2)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the subsectionrequires the engineer to submit to the borrower a list of prospective biddersand a recommendation as to which bidders are qualified. The requirementshould simply indicate the borrower shall obtain a list of prospectivebidders and a list of qualified bidders. <T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been so revised. <T3>Section 1765.8(a)(5)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the regulationshould state what specific conditions would justify a rebid. <T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been revised to state the specificconditions. One respondent commented that the rebidding requirement should be deletedbecause there is no basis in the Act for it. <T3>Response</T3>_The loan documents require the borrower to use competitivebidding unless otherwise approved by REA. REA believes that bidding withfewer than three bidders is not full free competitive bidding if otherresponsive bids were readily obtainable.<T3>Section 1765.8(a)(6)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the regulationshould not include advice to the borrower that it be able to contact itsattorney at a bid opening. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes such advice is appropriate because experienceindicates that questions often arise at the bid opening that require consultationwith the borrower's attorney. <T3>Section 1765.8(a)(7)</T3>_Several respondents commented that advisorylanguage suggesting that the borrower's engineer review all bids and thatthe borrower allow bidders to make changes in certain circumstances shouldnot be included in the final rule. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes this requirement is appropriate to ensurethat all bidders are treated fairly and equitably. The final rule has beenrevised to require the borrower to make the determinations. <T3>Sections 1765.8(a) (8), (9), and (10)</T3>_Several respondents commentedthat these procedures recite basic aspects of competitive practices andneed not be required. Furthermore, if REA intends to impose requirements,those requirements should be placed upon the borrower. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes these procedures should be required. Thefinal rule has been revised to make the borrower responsible for theserequirements. <T3>Section 1765.8(a)(11)(i)</T3>_Several respondents commented that thissubsection requires the engineer to recommend award to the low bidder.<T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been revised to require the borrowerto obtain from the engineer the determination of the lowest responsivebid, a tabulation of all bids and the engineer's recommendation for awardof the contract. <T3>Section 1765.9(c)</T3>_Several respondents contended that the provisionin REA Subcontract Form 282 holding the contractor fully responsible forthe acts and omissions of the subcontractor obviates the need for thissubsection. REA believes reiterating the contract provision in this subsection is appropriateto inform all parties of the consequences of subcontracting. <T3>Section 1765.9(d)</T3>_Several respondents contend that this subsectionshould not prohibit subcontractors from beginning construction prior toREA approval of the subcontract. <T3>Response</T3>_The subcontract states work shall not start until REAhas approved the subcontract. The final rule has been revised to clarifythis. <T3>Section 1765.10</T3>_Several respondents commented that recommendinga preconstruction conference does not belong in the final rule. <T3>Response</T3>_This subsection has been revised to make the preconstructionconference a requirement. <T3>Section 1765.11(a)</T3>_One respondent recommends that REA permit moreflexibility to borrowers and contractors for contract amendments. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes the approval conditions in this subsectionare reasonable and necessary to ensure the integrity of contract procurementand to ensure funds are available to comply with the payment provisionsof the contract. <T3>Section 1765.11(b)</T3>_Several respondents commented that this subsectionallows borrowers and contractors to execute contract amendments not meetingthe criteria of andSection; 1765.11(a). <T3>Response</T3>_The final rule has been revised to clarify that priorREA approval to execute contract amendments excluded by the andSection; 1765.11(a)criteria is not required but the executed amendments do require REA approval.<T3>Section 1765.11(c)_</T3>Several respondents commented that this subsectionis advisory and should not be in the final rule. <T3>Response_</T3>This subsection has been revised to make this a requirementfor the borrower. Subpart B <T3>Section 1765.15(c)_</T3>Several respondents commented that this sectionshould be eliminated. <T3>Response_</T3>The criteria and requirements for including financingfor buildings as a loan purpose are included in 7 CFR part 1745 and 7 CFRpart 1749. This subsection has been deleted in the final rule. <T3>Section 1765.15(f)_</T3>Several respondents commented that the requirementfor sealed competitive bids should apply to the borrower. <T3>Response_</T3>Subsection 1765.15(e) in the final rule has been revisedto require the borrower to use the sealed competitive bid procedure exceptwhen an alternative procedure is allowed. <T3>Section 1765.15(h)_</T3>Several respondents commented that REA shouldpermit borrowers to perform building construction under more than one contract.One respondent commented this subsection should be eliminated because itis not required by the Act. <T3>Response_</T3>Subsection 1765.15(g) in the final rule has been revisedto require only the construction pertaining to the building structure tobe included under one contract. The nonbuilding structure constructionmay be included in this contract or may be by separate contracts. It isnot REA's intention to require that all buildings under a loan be placedunder one contract. <T3>Section 1765.16 (a) and (b)_</T3>Several respondents commented thatthese subsections do not specify who shall prepare the Pandamp;S and completethe Form 257. <T3>Response_</T3>Both sections have been revised in the final rule toplace this requirement on the borrower. <T3>Section 1765.16(a)(3)_</T3>One respondent commented that digital electronicswitching and transmission apparatus require certain environmental parametersfor proper operation. REA should make it a requirement for the buildingarchitect or engineer to coordinate the inclusion of the required environmentalfeatures in the detailed building plans or other suitable portions of thePandamp;S. <T3>Response_</T3>Section 1765.16(a)(3) has been revised to include thisrequirement. <T3>Section 1765.16(b)(2)_</T3>One respondent commented that the sentencestating that the number of alternates shall be kept to a minimum shouldbe eliminated because it is not required by the Act and because it is asubjective condition. <T3>Response_</T3>REA believes this requirement is necessary for an orderly,straightforward, sealed competitive bid procedure. The requirement in thefinal rule places the responsibility on the borrower to keep the alternatesto a minimum. <T3>Section 1765.16(b)(3)_</T3>Several respondents commented that thisprovision is advisory and not needed and should not be included in thefinal rule. <T3>Response_</T3>This subsection is not advisory. It contains requirementsnecessary to insure orderly bidding and protection of expensive electronicequipment. The subsection is retained in the final rule. <T3>Section 1765.17(b)_</T3>Several respondents commented that REA's procedurefor approving title is unnecessary, expensive, and burdensome. They proposedthat Part 1765 be revised to take REA out of the title examination business.<T3>Response_</T3>REA does not perform title examinations. REA reviewstitle examinations performed by others to establish evidence that the borrowerhas an interest in the property that is satisfactory to REA. <T3>Section 1765.19(b)_</T3>Several respondents commented that the subsectiondoes not specify who is required to obtain REA approval to do force accountconstruction. <T3>Response_</T3>The subsection has been revised to require the borrowerto obtain this approval. <T3>Section 1765.19(c)_</T3>Several respondents commented that the subsectiondoes not specify who is required to prepare the Pandamp;S. <T3>Response_</T3>The subsection has been revised to require the borrowerto prepare the Pandamp;S. <T3>Section 1765.19(d) (2) and (4)_</T3>Several respondents commented thatthe phrase ``eligible for REA financing'' is unnecessary because REA hasalready approved the building facilities in its loan approval. <T3>Response_</T3>The subsection is intended to accommodate borrowers whoneed to construct a building that includes floor space approved in a loanand floor space not approved in a loan. As a convenience to borrowers,REA will approve FAP's which contain items that are not eligible for REAfinancing if the borrower segregates costs to cover those items. Subsection(4) has been revised to require an estimate for each major constructionitem only when all of the building construction was not included in theproposed loan. <T3>Section 1765.19(e)_</T3>Several respondents commented that this subsectionstates that force account construction should not be started until approvedby REA, which is advisory. <T3>Response_</T3>Section 1765.19(e) has been revised deleting the advisorylanguage and stating that construction performed prior to REA approvalmay not be included in the loan. Subpart C <T3>Section 1765.26(d)_</T3>Several respondents commented that REA requiresthat bid alternates be kept to a minimum, but does not define ``minimum,''thereby leaving the final decision as to how many alternates are allowableto REA. <T3>Response_</T3>This subsection was written to allow borrowers a degreeof flexibility in requesting bid alternates. If ``minimum'' is definedin the rule, it might unnecessarily limit a borrower's choice of equipmentoptions. <T3>Section 1765.26(d)_</T3>One respondent proposed that the requirementbe eliminated because it is not required by the REA Act and could limitaccess to loan funds. <T3>Response_</T3>The requirement to limit bid alternates is for the purposeof protecting the integrity of the sealed competitive bidding procedure,which is essential to the economical provision of telephone service. <T3>Section 1765.26(e)_</T3>Several respondents commented that this subsectionrequires sealed competitive bidding but does not state of whom REA requiresit. <T3>Response_</T3>The subsection has been revised to require the borrowerto take sealed competitive bids, unless another procurement method hasbeen approved by REA. <T3>Section 1765.27(a)(3)_</T3>Several respondents commented that REA Form522 should be published with this regulation if REA is requiring the quantityand type of spare parts be determined in accordance with specification.<T3>Response_</T3>REA Form 522, General Specification for Digital, StoredProgram Controlled Central Office Equipment, is incorporated by referenceas listed in 7 CFR part 1772.<T3>Section 1765.27(b)(2)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the effectivestatus of the TEandamp;CM as a binding document must be made clear if itis to specify the requirements for preparation of detailed equipment specifications.<T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised to clarify that the TEandamp;CMprovides guidelines for preparation of the detailed equipment specifications.REA believes this advisory information is appropriate to minimize the burdenand costs to the borrowers. <T3>Section 1765.28(a)(2)(i) (G) and (K)</T3>_One respondent recommendedthat these subsections be expanded by listing some specific topics to bediscussed. <T3>Response</T3>_These subsections have been revised to include such topics.<T3>Section 1765.28(a)(2)(vi)</T3>_Several respondents commented that theword ``generally'' indicates a subjective condition to the granting ofapproval by REA for the borrower to proceed when fewer than three biddershave been qualified. <T3>Response</T3>_This subsection has been revised to clarify REA's intent.The word ``generally'' remains for the purpose of allowing borrowers andREA some flexibility for unforeseeable bidding difficulties. <T3>Section 1765.28(b)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the statementthat REA approval of the borrower's request to procure central office equipmentthrough single source negotiation will be conditioned upon the borrowerobtaining prices in line with current competitive prices should be deletedin the final rule. <T3>Response</T3>_This statement has been deleted from andSection; 1765.28(b),where it was intended as a condition to REA's approval of the borrower'srequest to negotiate. Similar wording has been inserted under andSection;1765.28(b)(7), where it is intended as a requirement for REA approval ofa supplier's proposal. REA maintains a data base of central office equipmentpricing for the purpose of assisting borrowers by making information availableon market prices. <T3>Section 1765.28(b)(4)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the subsectionplaces a requirement on the supplier and that it should be revised to statethat al1 proposals must be completed, dated, and signed. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised accordingly. <T3>Section 1765.28(b)(5)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the subsectionshould be revised to state that the borrower shall obtain a recommendationfrom the engineer. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised accordingly. <T3>Section 1765.28(c)</T3>_One respondent commented that as stated inthis subsection REA's requirements for a software license do not fullyaddress the needs of the software vendor. The respondent listed examplesof specific alleged deficiencies in REA's requirements. <T3>Response</T3>_This subsection is not a software license. It is a listof REA's requirements for a software license. Suppliers will have requirementsfor software licenses and so may borrowers. From all these requirementsa software license will have to be crafted that is acceptable to all parties.REA prefers not to write a software license because suppliers requirementsvary and are subject to change.  <T3>Section 1765.28(c)(iv)</T3>_One respondent commented that it is notfeasible to transfer ownership of software to the borrower in the eventof support abandonment by a supplier. The respondent observed that manyowners of switching products might become joint owners of a software package.<T3>Response</T3>_This requirement will not come into play unless the supplieris unwilling or unable to provide software support, so a supplier wouldhave to abandon the software to lose ownership of it. Once such abandonmenthas occurred, the borrower must at least have the right to modify the softwareand the means to do so. Transferring ownership and backup documentationis, in REA's view, the only way to ensure this. <T3>Section 1765.28(c)(v)</T3>_One respondent commented that a softwarewarranty of indefinite duration against errors and incompleteness is unreasonableand not standard in the industry. <T3>Response</T3>_This has been revised to reduce the minimum warrantyto 5 years, which should provide adequate protection to borrowers and REA.<T3>Section 1765.28(c)</T3>_One respondent commented that the softwarelicense agreement should also include conditions involving changes in ownershipof the telephone company. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised to clarify the rightsunder the licensing agreement that apply to the future owners of the telephonecompany as well as the present owner. <T3>Section 1765.28(f)</T3>_One respondent commented that this subsectionshould be removed in its entirety as it represents an optional practicethat is not required by the Act. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes this requirement is appropriate as it isa good business practice to prevent problems and reduce burdens for allparties. <T3>Section 1765.29(d)</T3>_One respondent commented that when the equipmentis provided under a Form 545 Contract (not including installation) themanufacturer is probably not required to participate in the grounding systemaudit. REA should require the manufacturer to provide a detailed bondingand grounding plan that can be utilized by the engineer, borrower, or othersresponsible for the installation. <T3>Response</T3>_A new subsection andSection; 1765.27(a)(4) has been includedin the final rule for the Pandamp;S to require such a plan. Subsection 1765.29(d)has been amended to require an audit of the bonding and grounding planprovided by the supplier of the equipment provided under Form 545 Contracts.Subpart D <T3>Section 1765.37(b)(5)</T3>_One respondent commented that REA shouldrequire that all materials furnished by the borrower under Supplement Abe ``REA Listed.'' <T3>Response</T3>_This subsection has been revised to include this requirement,unless special REA approval is granted to use unlisted materials. <T3>Section 1765.38(a)(3)(iv)</T3>_Several respondents commented that thissubsection requires the engineer to prepare and distribute minutes of thepre-bid conference and feel that such a requirement is unnecessary. <T3>Response</T3>_REA believes that pre-bid notes are necessary to establisha legal record of the construction project. The subsection has been revisedto place the requirement on the borrower. <T3>Section 1765.38(b)(3)(iii)</T3>_Several respondents commented thatit should be made clear that it is the borrower's responsibility to obtainand distribute negotiation conference notes. <T3>Response</T3>_This requirement has been clarified. <T3>Section 1765 38(f)(1)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the requirementfor obtaining material receipts should be placed on the borrower. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised to clarify this requirement.<T3>Section 1765.38(f)(3)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the subsectionrequires the contractor to credit the borrower for furnished materials,whereas the requirement should be that the borrower obtain invoices showingthe credit. <T3>Response</T3>_This requirement has been clarified. <T3>Section 1756.39(c)(2)</T3>_Several respondents commented that the subsectiondoes not state who is responsible for preparing and distributing the contractcloseout documents. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been revised to place this requirementon the borrower.Subpart F <T3>Section 1765.58(a)(2)</T3>_Several respondents commented that thissubsection requires that proposals be received from three or more sellers,whereas it should state that the borrower or its agent shall seek at leastthree proposals. <T3>Response</T3>_The subsection has been amended accordingly. <T3>Section 1756.58(a)(6)</T3>_Several respondents commented that thissubsection, which recommends that initial installation of special equipmentbe installed by the seller, is advisory and does not belong in the finalrule. <T3>Response</T3>_REA was inclined to make this a requirement because ofpast experience, but did not do so to allow borrowers flexibility. Therecommendation has been retained in the final rule. <T3>Section 1765.58(d)(1) (ii) and (iii)</T3>_Several respondents commentedthat these subsections require the contractor to perform inspections andfurnish results to the borrower, whereas they should require the borrowerto obtain the inspections. <T3>Response</T3>_Subsections (ii) and (iii) have been combined into anew subsection (ii) clarifying the requirement.<T3>Section 1765.58(d)(2)</T3>_One respondent commented that the sellershould be required to furnish installation information to enable the borrowerto perform all of the inspections and tests to determine that specificationsrequirements are met. <T3>Response</T3>_A new subsection 1765.58(a)(1)(iv) has been added inthe final rule to require a bonding and grounding plan and installationplans. <T3>Appendix D</T3>_One respondent commented that Step 5 requires the REAField Accountant to audit Form 281 and examine construction records ``whenrequired.'' They recommended that this be performed during the first loanfund audit after the final payment under the contract. <T3>Response</T3>_Step 15 has been added which requires this audit andexamination as recommended. Step 5, for audit and examination when requestedby the GFR, has also been retained. 7 CFR part 1765 supersedes any sections of REA Bulletins with which itis in conflict. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1765 </ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA amends 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding the following new part1765: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1765_TELEPHONE MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION_TELEPHONEPROGRAM </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.1 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.2 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.3 Preconstruction review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.4 Major and minor construction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.5 Methods of major construction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.6 Standards, specifications, and general requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.7 Plans and specifications (Pandamp;S). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.8 Contract construction procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.9 Subcontracts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.10 Preconstruction conference. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.11 Contract amendments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.12-1765.14 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Construction of Buildings </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.15 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.16 Plans and specifications (Pandamp;S). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.17 Bidding procedure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.18 Contract amendments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.19 Force account procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.20 Closeout procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.21-1765.25 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Purchase and Installation of Central Office Equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.26 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.27 Plans and specifications (Pandamp;S). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.28 Procurement procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.29 Closeout documents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.30-1765.35 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Outside Plant Major Construction by Contract </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.36 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.37 Plans and specifications (Pandamp;S). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.38 Procurement procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.39 Closeout documents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.40-1765.45 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Outside Plant Major Construction by Force Account </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.46-1765.55 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Purchase and Installation of Special Equipment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.56 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.57 Contracts and specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.58 Purchasing special equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1765.59-1765.65 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Methods of Minor Construction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">1765.66-1765.80 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart H_Construction Certification Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">1765.81-1765.99 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_Documents Required to Closeout Construction of Buildings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix B_Documents Required to Closeout Central Office EquipmentContract </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix C_Documents Required to Closeout Telephone Construction ContractREA Form 515 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix D_Step-by-Step Procedure for Closing Out Telephone ConstructionContract Labor and Materials, REA Form 515 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix E_[Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix F_Documents Required to Closeout Special Equipment Contracts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901 <T3>et seq.</T3>, 7 U.S.C. 1921 <T3>et seq. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">SUBPART A_General </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1765.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> General. </ITAG>(a) The standard REA Telephone Loan Documents contain provisions regardingprocurement of materials and equipment and construction of telecommunicationfacilities by telephone borrowers. This part 1765 implements certain ofthe provisions by setting forth the requirements and procedures to be followedby borrowers for purchasing materials and equipment and construction oftelecommunication facilities by contract or force account. (b) The typical procedure followed in constructing a project financed byan REA loan begins with the prospective borrower obtaining the necessarypreloan engineering and developing a complete loan application, includingan LD (See 7 CFR part 1749). If a loan is approved and all prerequisitesto advance of funds are satisfied, the borrower may proceed with the purchaseand installation of materials and equipment and the construction of telephonefacilities pursuant to this part 1765. Subpart A describes(1) REA's general requirements with respect to steps to be taken afterthe loan is approved and before construction begins (See andSection; 1765.3),(2) REA requirements with respect to methods of construction (See andSection;andSection;1765.5 and 1765.6), (3) REA requirements regarding sealed competitive bidding and negotiatedbidding of construction contracts (See andSection;andSection; 1765.6 and .9),(4) REA standards for materials, equipment, and construction financed withloan funds (See andSection; 1765.7), and (5) REA requirements for subcontracts and contract amendments coveringconstruction financed with loan funds (See andSection;andSection; 1765.10 and.12). (c) Each borrower is responsible for the construction of its facilitiesand for the procurement of materials and equipment that are best suitedto its needs. (d) If contracts, Pandamp;S, or other methods of procurement are subjectto REA approval pursuant to the provisions of the loan contract, as implementedby this part, REA will review the documents or proposals submitted andnotify the borrower in writing of approval or disapproval. REA may withholdapproval if, in REA's judgment: (1) The Pandamp;S or contract will not accomplish loan purposes. (2) Provisions of the Pandamp;S or contract will add unnecessary expenseto the project. (3) The proposal, method of procurement, or Pandamp;S do not conform to REAengineering criteria or construction standards, or if they present unacceptableloan security risks to REA. (4) The Pandamp;S or contract have been modified. (e) The requirements and procedures covering procurement of architecturaland engineering services are described in 7 CFR part 1763.
