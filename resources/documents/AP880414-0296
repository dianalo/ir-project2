Doug Elmets, press aide to Energy Secretary John Herrington,said, ``It's the department's belief and the government's policythat assistance to OPEC in its effort to manipulate the price ofoil is not the correct approach.''   Kent Hance, one of three members of the Texas RailroadCommission, met earlier this month with Rilwanu Lukman, thepresident of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, anddiscussed the possibility that his state and the cartel wouldcooperate.   AP-Dow Jones asked Lukman last week whether the cooperationmight be in the nature of an information exchange or productioncuts. He replied, ``Exchanging information isn't going to do thetrick is it?''   Hance told Harte-Hanks newspapers Tuesday that he would attendthe cartel's April 23 meeting in Vienna. ``I think that (cuttingTexas production) is one of the things that has to be considered,''he said. ``It would be one of the items we would discuss.''   Interviewed from Austin on Thursday, Hance said ``We have theright ... to set our production allowables. We can do it to preventwaste.''   ``We are not trying to seek an alliance or cartel. We just wantinput. ... our goal is one of stability,'' he said.   Hance said he wouldn't make any deals without the approval ofhis colleagues and Gov. Bill Clements, who have told him to goahead with the trip.   Some industry analysts expressed doubts about the wisdom of suchan action, while others questioned its legality.   ``It is probably a violation of the antitrust laws,'' said JohnLamont, oil specialist in the Washington law firm of Lobel, Novins,Lamont andamp; Flug.   However, William Baxter, who headed the antitrust division ofthe Justice Department early in the Reagan administration, said,``It is fairly standard doctrine that the antitrust laws apply onlyto private activity,'' not action by a state.   Hance's efforts pose ``a very interesting question. The economicevil that results is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws areaimed against,'' Baxter said in an interview from the StanfordUniversity Law School in Palo Alto, Calif., where he is a professor.   Mark Sheehan, spokesman for the antitrust division, declinedimmediate comment.   Ed Rothschild, assistant director of the Consumer-Labor EnergyCoalition, an advocacy group in Washington, said it was ``a joke''to think Texas can help OPEC be any more effective in holding upprices than it has been in recent years.   But, he said, ``It would be tantamount to criminal activity ifanyone in the private sector did it.''   Texas is the nation's No. 1 oil producer. Statistics for 1986,the most recent that break down production by state, show output of2.3 million barrels from 201,000 wells _ a quarter of the nation'sproduction and a third of its wells.   Since 1972, the Texas Railroad Commission has set allowableproduction quotas at 100 percent of capacity. It was these quotasthat had permitted Texas to serve the role of ``swing producer'' inworld oil markets before the rise of OPEC in the 1960s and 1970s.   Texas was hit hard by the oil price collapse of 1986 engineeredby OPEC's leading producer, Saudi Arabia. The state lost 8,000wells during that year. The average price at the well plunged from$26.80 per barrel in 1985 to $14.74 in 1986, cutting the aggregatewellhead value of the state's crude production from $24 billion to$12 billion.   Prices have recovered from their lows of 1986, but never haveapproached the 1985 price.   OPEC's recent conversations with non-member nations, and theprospect of their cooperation, kicked up typical prices this weekby about $1 a barrel to a bit more than $18 a barrel, which isOPEC's benchmark price.   ``We can't bury our heads in the sand anymore and hope thingsget better,'' Hance said, adding that he would not take part in theformal OPEC sessions but would ``meet with some of the OEPCministers'' separately.   Arnold Safer, president of Energy Futures Group Inc., aWashington consulting firm, said a likely cutback would be about70,000 barrels a day _ an amount he said could be made up quicklyby other sources.   ``You could probably squeeze that much out of other (U.S.)states,'' he said.   ``The politics of the day may not be in Texas' interest. Thefederal government might not like it. In the consuming states,obviously, reaction wouldn't be favorable to getting in bed withOPEC,'' Safer added.</TEXT></DOC>
