(Prices).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (Marketing).andO;Topic:     CompetitionDiscount HardwarePricing PolicyComputer industryMicrocomputersUser-Friendliness.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In a column written in mid-August, I observed that lower prices forIBM-compatible systems and the widening success of Windows 3.0 posed aserious challenge to the Apple Macintosh.andP;  &quot;It is not too late for Apple toact,&quot; I wrote, but cautioned, &quot;The sooner Apple responds with more aggressiveprices and lower cost entry systems, the better Apple's prospects will be.&quot;andM;Apple's introduction of the Mac Classic, LC and IIsi this month was preciselywhat was needed to ensure that the Macintosh will continue to provide aviable alternative to IBM and compatible systems running DOS, Windows orOS/2.andM;The Mac Classic is just what the doctor ordered to plug the hole at the lowend of Apple's product line.andP;  Priced in line with Tandy's 1000RL &quot;homecomputer&quot; and below IBM's PS/1, the Mac Classic offers an affordableentry-level system.andP;  The LC and IIsi and revised pricing for older modelssubstantially improve Apple's price/performance across the product line.andM;Granted, the Mac Classic is still a small-screen monochrome system.andP;  However,the success of its more expensive predecessors has shown that color issecondary to the ease of learning and of use of the Mac software.andM;There is little room for doubt that despite the enormous improvements inWindows 3.0, the Mac is still a much more usable environment for most noviceusers.andM;For those who are at ease with abstract symbol manipulation, the intricaciesof DOS are no problem.andP;  But for the much greater number of folks who justwant to DO something with a computer, the Mac remains superior.andM;Whenever I recommend a computer for a novice user, unless I believe that heor she is particularly inclined to get &quot;into&quot; computers, I unhesitatinglyrecommend a Macintosh, despite the fact that I use IBM systems as my primary&quot;working&quot; platforms.andM;Until Apple's recent announcements, I had to qualify that recommendation byadding, &quot;if you can afford one.&quot; That is no longer necessary.andM;Recommending the Macintosh to new users wasn't my first inclination.andO;Although I've always liked the Mac and have long used one for particularapplications, my initial response was to suggest low-cost IBM compatibles.andM;Only after considerable experience trying to explain DOS to sincerelyinterested people who just didn't seem to get comfortable with it did I beginsuggesting that they look at a Mac.andP;  I was quite surprised by the results.andM;People for whom DIR and CHKDSK were impenetrable mysteries suddenly blossomedinto sophisticated computer users when they sat down in front of a Mac.andO;People who seemingly had been destined to hate computers were somehowtransformed into enthusiastic users.andM;There is now no doubt in my mind that if I needed to introduce acomputer-averse senior executive to using a PC, I would consider a Macintoshthe default option of choice.andM;None of this is meant in any way to detract from Windows 3.0, which does amuch better job providing a standard environment for graphical applicationsthan replicating the ease of use of the Macintosh.andM;It is tremendously important that former Mac-only applications like PageMakerare now available on IBM and compatible software.andP;  In that sense, the gapbetween IBM and Mac worlds has largely been closed.andM;But when it comes to near-intuitive use, Windows still has a long way to go.andO;The file- and program-management functions, for example, are a long way fromtheir Macintosh counterparts.andM;What the Macintosh had lost for a time was generally a sufficiently low-costentry system and competitive prices.andP;  With Apple's new models and prices,both have effectively been regained.andP;  The result is likely to be continuedsuccess for Apple and a renewed interest in the Macintosh as a viablealternative, both at home and in the office.andP;  That's good news for users aswell as for Apple.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
