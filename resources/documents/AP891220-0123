(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The evangelist who introduced PTL founderJim Bakker to Jessica Hahn, leading to the scandal that destroyedthe television ministry, was released on $25,000 bond Wednesday onfederal perjury charges.   In his first court appearance on the charges, John WesleyFletcher appeared without a lawyer before U.S. Magistrate PaulTaylor, who imposed several conditions for his release, includingsurrendering his passport and refraining from the use of alcohol.Fletcher recently was arrested in Durham on a charge of drivingwhile intoxicated.   According to the Dec. 5 indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, Fletcherdenied during testimony before the grand jury that indicted Bakkerand three associates that he took Ms. Hahn to a Florida hotel tohave sex with Bakker. At a later appearance, Fletcher told the samegrand jury that he agreed when Bakker told him: ``Get me a woman.''   In a separate hearing, the Rev. Sam Johnson, a former PTLminister, was released on the same unsecured bond. Johnson isaccused of lying to the special grand jury about a $10,000 loan hemade to former PTL executive Richard Dortch that later went to Ms.Hahn.   The payment to Ms. Hahn was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the formerchurch secretary received $265,000 in PTL money in exchange for hersilence about her 1980 sexual liaison with Bakker. Disclosure ofthe payment eventually brought down the PTL evanglism empire builtby Bakker, who is now in federal prison after being convicted inOctober of fraud and conspiracy charges.   ``I feel very confident,'' Johnson said as he left thecourthouse. ``This has been a very unfortunate experience.''   Asked if he would plead innocent, he responded: ``Absolutely.''   Taylor agreed to appoint counsel for Fletcher after theevangelist told the magistrate: ``I have nothing, sir, except theclothes on my back.'' Taylor said later that Fletcher, who filedfor bankruptcy court protection in 1987, had signed an affidavitsaying he could not afford an attorney.   Johnson faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for eachof 12 perjury counts. Fletcher could face the same sentence on oneperjury count.   No arraignment was scheduled for Fletcher. Taylor scheduled aJan. 16 arraignment for Johnson.</TEXT></DOC>
