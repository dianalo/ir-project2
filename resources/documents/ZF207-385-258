 Software developers either love it orhate it--there are almost no fence straddlers.andM;Although Forth doesn't receive as much press as C, Pascal, Smalltalk, orBASIC, it does have a devoted following.andP;  Unfortunately, Forth has beenclassified by many as a &quot;cult&quot; language: while its devotees expound on theconciseness, speed, ease of development, and power the language has, otherscomplain about its unreadability, lack of power, stiff learning curve, anddifferences from other languages.andM;It is unfortunate that many programmers feel this way since Forth has much tooffer.andP;  Indeed, many implementations of Forth offer more power andprogramming facilities than most other languages.andP;  Many programmers complainthat no popular commercial programs are written in Forth.andP;  However,Starflight from Electronic Arts (written by Binary Systems) is written inForth.andP;  So is Rapid File from Ashton Tate.andP;  To put it bluntly, Forth is justas capable as C or Pascal.andM;This review will not attempt to settle the arguments concerning Forth.andO;Rather, it covers three Forth systems for the IBM PC running PC-DOS orMS-DOS.andP;  It will examine what these systems offer to the Forth newcomer andwhat the die-hard Forth programmer can expect as well.andM;Forth is an interactive language.andP;  It is basically a collection of wordswritten in Forth or assembler.andP;  Forth is interactive because the systemresponds to words typed at the console immediately, just as interpreted BASICdoes when you type in a command or statement and press Return.andP;  However, whenyou define new words to Forth, they are compiled into Forth's dictionary.andO;You create Forth programs by writing new words and putting them in thedictionary.andM;This process sounds straightforward enough, but two aspects of Forth confuseprogrammers who have never used it before: the stack and Forth's view of thecomputer.andP;  Like other computer languages, Forth has named variables.andO;However, most words in Forth use the stack to pass values to other words orreturn values.andP;  This stack works just like the stack the CPU uses when youuse a PUSH instruction in assembler.andP;  Many programmers new to Forth havetrouble dealing with the stack since other languages tend to hide the stackfrom you.andP;  Forth programmers use the stack all the time.andP;  Forth's stack isnot the same as the one used by the CPU.andP;  Forth has a stack whether or notthe host machine is stack-based.andM;The other mystery to non-Forth programmers is that Forth has a rather simpleand idealized view of the computer.andP;  Forth stores your programs in numberedblocks on the disk instead of using file names like other languages, becauseForth was originally developed to run as the only program on the hostcomputer.andP;  Strangely enough, Forth expects to be both the language and theoperating system.andP;  Although most current implementations of Forth run on topof other operating systems, some versions still use this numbered-blocksystem of storing files.andP;  Each block is 1K in size, usually consisting of 16lines of 64 characters each, and is referred to as a &quot;screen.&quot;andP;  How thesescreens are actually mapped to disk or stored by the host operating system isup to the Forth implementor.andM;One could argue that Forth is a structured language.andP;  Unlike other languageswhere the programmer writes a series of statements and then goes through theedit-compile-test-debug phase, Forth programmers usually develop theirprograms in small, easily testable chunks.andP;  This aspect of Forth makes it aneasy language to learn.andP;  You get immediate feedback.andP;  After a word has beenwritten and debugged, it can be compiled into the dictionary and treated aspart of the language.andM;Forth encourages modular code.andP;  It is possible to write unreadable Forthcode, but you can write unreadable code in any language.andM;Novice programmers usually have an easier time learning Forth thanexperienced programmers.andP;  Forth's stack and the use of postfix notation formath appear bizarre and confusing to C and Pascal programmers.andP;  However,these factors also make Forth as small and efficient as possible.andP;  Manyprogrammers are quite surprised when they look at a professional Forthdevelopment system and discover that the main kernel is contained in a 30K.COM or .EXE file.andM;Forth was developed in the late 1960s by Charles Moore as an alternative tothe programming languages available at that time.andP;  Forth gets its name fromthe computer Charles Moore developed it on: as the story goes, Mooreconsidered Forth a fourth-generation language and wanted to name if FOURTH,but the computer would only accept five characters for file names--so henamed it Forth.andM;Later, Moore used the language during his stint at the National RadioAstronomy Observatory, where his work with the language convinced many peoplethat Forth was a truly useful language.andM;To date, two major versions of the Forth standard have emerged: Forth-79 andForth-83.andP;  Because many vendors felt Forth-83 was not a vast improvement,they did not add support for it to their systems.andP;  Consequently, bothstandards are in use and supported by many implementations.andP;  Unfortunately,the Forth standard does not address such items as floating-point arithmeticor file I/O.andP;  This shortcoming has caused many vendors to add their own&quot;extensions&quot; to the language to make their specific implementations useful.andM;This review evaluates three Forth systems implemented under DOS: UR/FORTHfrom Laboratory Microsystems, PolyFORTH ISD-4 from Forth Inc., and HS/FORTHfrom Harvard Softworks.andM;Laboratory Microsystems Inc.andM;UR/FORTH v. 1.0andM;Laboratory Microsystems Inc. (LMI) makes implementations of Forth for theZ80, 8080, 80x86, and 680x0 chips.andP;  UR/FORTH, the company's Forthapplications development system, is available under MS-DOS, OS/2, 80386protected mode, and 680x0 UNIX.andP;  In addition, LMI makes a Forth crosscompiler that allows you to develop ROMable applications for a number oftarget CPUs on your PC.andM;The review copy of UR/FORTH is the standard release and includes the Forthinterpreter/compiler, a full-screen editor, an assembler, support for bothsoftware floating point and the 80x87 chips, a native code optimizer, andgraphics support for the CGA, EGA, and Hercules display cards.andM;UR/FORTH is based on the Forth-83 standard and strives to maintainportability across all platforms.andP;  The manual, at approximately 500 pages,contains a user's guide, a quick reference to Forth words, reference sectionsfor the screen editor and the assembler, and overview of the words concerningthe interface to MS-DOS, and reference sections for each of the packages thatcome with the system.andM;UR/FORTH is quite easy to install.andP;  A supplied program copies theinstallation disks to your hard drive and creates an executable version ofUR/FORTH for your particular display card.andP;  This is not to say you can't runthe copy of UR/FORTH from the distribution diskettes.andP;  However, the kernel onthe masters uses a rather generic display driver.andP;  The installed driverallows the user of graphics and greatly speeds screen access.andP;  Once thesystem is installed, just go to the directory and execute FORTH.andM;UR/FORTH stores Forth code in .BIN or .SCR files.andP;  .BIN files are createdusing the relocating overlay utility, while .SCR files contain Forth sourcecode.andP;  The USING word loads new screen files.andP;  Once you have issued the USINGcommand, all references to block numbers apply to the screen file you'veloaded.andM;UR/FORTH has a full-screen editor with commands resembling WordStar's.andP;  Ithas facilities for copying screens, moving screens, and automatically datingscreens whenever a change is made.andP;  It also supports a screen stack, whichallows you to push a screen number, go work on another screen, and pop backto where you were.andM;UR/FORTH has a postfix assembler and includes support for 80x86 and 80x87chips.andP;  While quite rudimentary compared to stand-alone assemblers forMS-DOS, it is capable of handling small programs.andM;UR/FORTH's interface to DOS consists of several levels similar to thoseencountered in the run-time libraries of most C compilers.andP;  The manual coversall of the levels but warns that you sacrifice portability if you use thelower level words.andP;  Words are available to handle memory management andaccess, file interface, environment manipulation, and task execution.andM;UR/FORTH includes support for graphics and screen control on EGA, CGA,Hercules, Compaq VDU, and MDA display cards.andP;  Words are provided to changedisplay modes, modify the palette on the EGA, handle display attributes, andchange the current display page.andM;If you wish to use graphics, you must load a supplied driver program first.andO;The words provided by this driver extend your control of graphics to handleellipses, circles, arcs, area filling, and pixel manipulation.andP;  While it issomewhat annoying to have to remember to load the external graphics driver todisplay graphics, LMI's bu lletin board system mentioned a new release ofUR/FORTH that did not need the external driver, so this minor annoyance maybe taken care of by now.andM;Finally, UR/FORTH has additional overlays that you may load to handlefloating-point math, multitasking, and the creation and use of relocatablebinary overlays.andP;  An optimizer is included to make your code more efficient.andO;If you wish to distribute your programs, you can use the turnkey package tocreate applications that can be distributed royalty-free.andM;The documentation provided with UR/FORTH is nicely done, although my copyseemed to have had a problem at the copiers (some pages were skewed or hadimages of paper clips on them).andP;  Admittedly a minor problem, but it mars anotherwise attractive manual.andP;  If you are new to Forth, buy a book on Forthalong with this package.andP;  The docs are not tutorial in nature.andM;Forth Inc.andM;PolyFORTH ISD-4 v. 21 June 1988andM;At a list price of almost $3,000 (and you thought the OS/2 SoftwareDevelopment Kit was expensive!), PolyFORTH ISD-4 from Forth Inc. is the mostexpensive of the Forth systems reviewed here.andP;  However, for the price you getthe backing of a company that has been in the Forth business almost as longas the language has existed and the benefit of a package that has been portedto many architectures, including minis and mainframes.andP;  Forth Inc. evenoffers training classes.andM;PolyFORTH comes on one 360K diskette.andP;  The installation program copies thefive files that make up PolyFORTH to your hard drive and then unpacks them.andO;The Forth source screens provided with the system are compressed to make themfit on one diskette.andM;PolyFORTH uses a concept called &quot;shadow screens&quot; to help document its code.andO;The source code is stored in two files.andP;  One contains the Forth code and theother contains documentation for the screens.andP;  As a result, you can switch tothe screen's &quot;shadow&quot; to see its documentation.andM;The review copy came with two manuals; one is generic to all PolyFORTHimplementations and the other is specific to the 8086 implementation.andP;  LeoBrodie's Starting Forth is also included.andP;  This book is recommended by manyForth programmers as the ideal starting point for Forth newcomers.andP;  Brodiealso helped write the documentation for PolyFORTH.andM;The 8086 manual covers the installation of PolyFORTH, its assembler, andother functions unique to the 80x86 implementation.andP;  Multitasking issupported on the IBM AT only since PolyFORTH FORTH uses the BIOS for many ofits functions.andP;  However, the BIOS can be bypassed for screen access.andO;Graphics are supported for CGA and EGA display cards.andM;When using multitasking, it is possible to attach terminals to your serialports and run Forth processes on them; however, setting the system up forthis is not a task for the novice.andP;  PolyFORTH offers a lot of power and youcan get into trouble if you don't read the documentation thoroughly.andM;While the 80x86-specific documentation covers a lotof ground, the mainPolyFORTH manual makes it seem tiny.andP;  If a complaint can be made aboutPolyFORTH's documentation, it's that there is a lot of it--not so much innumber of pages, but in the amount of information covered in the manual.andP;  Notonly does PolyFORTH have multitasking, graphics, a full-screen editor, anassembler, and all the standard Forth words, it also has tools for indexeddatabase support, burning Forth programs into ROM, transferring Forth codefrom one PolyFORTH system to another, and words to help document Forth sourcecode.andP;  The system gives you a lot for the money.andM;Is it worth the price?andP;  That's a matter of opinion.andP;  Many large companies usePolyFORTH and rely on Forth Inc. for support.andP;  This package provides a lot ofpower for the professional, and the inclusion of Brodie's book makes it easyfor new Forth programmers to get up and running.andM;Harvard SoftworksandM;HS/FORTH v. 4.0andM;If PolyFORTH is too expensive for your budget, HS/FORTH might fit it.andO;Harvard Softworks makes several versions of HS/FORTH system, ranging from astudent implementation to a full-blown production version reviewed here.andM;If any of these systems could be considered a starting system, HS/FORTH isit.andP;  Supplied with the compiler is a copy of FORTH: A Text and Reference byMahlon G. Kelly and Nicholas Spies.andP;  While this book covers some informationspecific to another Forth information specific to another Forthimplementation (MMSFORTH from Miller Microcomputer Systems), the manual forHS/FORTH makes extensive reference to its as a learning guide.andP;  Kelly helpedwrite the reference manual for HS/FORTH.andM;HS/FORTH matches PolyFORTH in sheer numbers of features.andP;  However, HS/FORTHwas not written to be available on a large number of architectures; it wasdesigned to take advantage of every aspect of the IBM PC class of machines.andO;Harvard Softworks seems convinced HS/FORTH could be used for any application.andM;HS/FORTH supports both the Forth-79 and Forth-83 standards.andP;  Words to supportgraphics on the CGA, EGA, and VGA are provided.andP;  HS/FORTH uses a uniquemethod of dictionary storage but gives you complete access to the 1MB ofmemory available under MS-DOS.andP;  While other Forth systems also allow thisaccess, they usually use a modified version of a 16-bit stack or 32 bits forthe stack.andP;  HS/FORTH does neither: it uses a unique method of accessingmemory on paragraph boundaries.andM;Output to windows can be performed using graphics words.andP;  However, if theinternal graphics words aren't powerful enough, HS/FORTH provides aninterface to C code.andP;  To supplement the internal graphics words, HS/FORTHincludes TurboWindow/C, a version of Metagraphics's excellent graphics systemfor Turbo C.andP;  HS/FORTH can even understand C variable declarations, includingstructures, to help link to C code.andP;  Like the other Forth systems, HS/FORTHsupports turnkey applications, a full screen editor, an assembler, anoptimizer, 80x87 arithmetic, multitasking, and ROMable code.andM;The documentation is massive.andP;  It is printed in a rather small font; notunreadable, but since most of the manual uses this font, the manual is veryintimidating.andP;  The review copy came with a small package of addenda forrelease 4.0 and covers several post-publication additions.andM;Choosing a ForthandM;Which of these systems is best for you?andP;  While PolyFORTH is an excellentproduct, its high price puts it out of the range of many programmers.andO;UR/FORTH is also a good product, but it loses out to HS/FOPRTH in features.andM;If portability is a concern, UR/FORTH is the only way to go.andP;  But if you arelooking for a good Forth system for the IBM PC and are not concerned aboutportability, HS/FORTH is it.andP;  With the many levels of the product HarvardSoftworks offers, you can start cheaply and upgrade to the more expensiveHS/FORTHs when needed.andP;  Additionally, having a Forth reference book to whichthe manual and product are geared can only encourage Forth newcomers toconsider this product.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
