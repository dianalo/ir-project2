 Although relatively unknownin the United States, it has been the best-selling Macintosh application inEurope for some time.andM;Ragtime's early versions suffered through two U.S.andP;  distributors that did notmarket or support the program well.andP;  Now, however, the owners of thecompany's West German distributor have established a new U.S.andP;  subsidiary,Ragtime USA, to market the program here.andM;When Ragtime 3 is released in early February, it will have not only bettersupport, but also a host of additional features and improved performance.andO;The spreadsheet has been entirely rewritten, and the graphing module iscompletely new.andP;  Other major enhancements include 24-bit color support,direct scanning and multilingual word processing.andM;Syncopated structure.andP;  The frame is Ragtime's building block.andP;  It providestighter integration than the separate application modules of programs likeMicrosoft Works.andP;  Frames allow all the functions to be used together tocreate a single multifaceted document without repeated cutting and pasting.andO;There are four frame types: text, picture, spreadsheet and graph.andP;  They canbe any size, and with a transparency option, they also can be overlaid.andM;Five programs in one.andP;  Each frame type has its own menu bar and associatedmode-specific commands.andP;  The page itself is a virtual fifth frame upon whichall manipulation of text, data and graphics takes place; a page-layout menubar is the default when you open a document.andM;New commands and functions have been added to every module in Ragtime 3.andP;  Thepage-layout mode has gained text flow around frames, floating frames andframe rotation.andP;  The word processing mode can hyphenate in 14 languages andhas optional dictionaries in eight languages.andP;  Text frames also supportkerning, search and replace by fonts and styles, type style macros, andcalculations within text.andM;Just as all spreadsheet functions are available within the word processor,the spreadsheet allows full word processing, including rulers and automaticword wrap.andP;  You can also rotate data and text within cells by 90-degreeincrements.andM;The spreadsheets are much bigger (253 columns by 16,000 rows) and faster thanin previous Ragtime versions.andP;  Since you can have unlimited linkedspreadsheets within a document and links to spreadsheets in other documents,spreadsheet size is essentially unlimited.andM;There is no macro language like Microsoft Excel's, but you can program scriptbuttons to execute a series of functions.andP;  There are also user-definablenumber, date and time formats.andM;The new graphing module includes the three basic chart types: bar, line andpie.andP;  But since graphs are frames, and frames can be transparent, you canoverlay charts to achieve special effects.andP;  There is also a 3-D pie-charttype, and all charts are dynamically linked to the spreadsheets.andM;The hallmark of Ragtime 3 seems to be maximum flexibility, and the chart modeis no exception.andP;  Every element is adjustable for color, font, style andscale.andM;The picture mode now has a Scan command, allowing direct scanning in ofimages from Apple, Abaton and some other standard scanners.andP;  Scanned imagescan then be adjusted or cropped within Ragtime.andM;Ragtime 3 can import text documents in MacWrite, Word 3, WriteNow and ASCIIformats; picture documents in PICT, Encapsulated PostScript and TIFF formats;and spreadsheet data in SYLK or ASCII form.andM;The sum of the parts.andP;  For business presentations, word and number processingis a natural combination.andP;  Ragtime provides a powerful tool for people whowant their numbers to look good.andP;  It is also particularly well-suited todesigning forms, one of its major uses with large corporate clients inEurope.andM;One way to look at Ragtime 3 is as an easy-to-use page-layout program withfour powerful applications built in.andP;  In this sense it is like a high-endversion of Works.andP;  On the other hand, you can compare its separate pieces toMicrosoft Word, Excel and Aldus PageMaker, the comparable best sellers ineach of Ragtime's modal categories.andP;  The new program does not have all thefeatures of those three power-houses combined, but with its own uniquecapabilities and integration, it adds up to a new powerhouse.andM;Ragtime 3 will list for $599.andP;  Current owners can upgrade at release for$195, or get the pre-release version for $150 now, with the release shippedfree later.andP;  Ragtime USA is located at 400 Walnut St., Suite 501, RedwoodCity, Calif.andP;
