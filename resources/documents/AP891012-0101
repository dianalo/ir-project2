Political principles should be the key factor in makingdecisions, the Beijing Daily quoted the city's party secretary, LiXiming, as telling a local committee meeting.   Party branches also should be involved in all decisions infactories, even such small matters as firing and allocating staff,Li said.   It was the second attack in as many days in the Beijing Daily onthe political reform program endorsed by the party in 1987 thatcalled for separating the functions of the ruling party andgovernment, and reducing interference of party officials inbusiness and other non-party matters.   A major commentary in the paper Wednesday charged that suchseparation weakened the party, and blamed the reform program onousted party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang even though itoriginally was backed by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.   The Communist Party long has maintained a shadow bureaucracy ingovernment and business, with party officials supervising andfrequently taking charge of all decisions.   In the reform atmosphere of the past decade, however, excessiveparty inteference was condemned and the power of party brancheswere weakened in many units.   In a major speech endorsed by the party in 1987, Zhao saidseparating party and government roles and letting factory managerstake charge of production was essential for China's development.   But since Zhao's ouster in June for allegedly supporting massivepro-democracy protests, strengthening the party has become theleadership's No. 1 goal.   The Beijing Daily quoted Li as saying the party must ``bringinto full play the powerful fighting force of the party branches.''   ``In universities ... street party committees that function asdistrict organs and party committees at village level and below,the party will not participate in decision making but make thedecisions,'' he said.   Street committees and village committees are the most basiclevel of local government, and have wide powers over job andhousing assignments.   Enterprise managers should get agreement of party officialsbefore hiring or firing personnel, Li added. ``In dismissing(enterprise) officials the party organization should act based onpolitical ideology, but should fully respect the administrativeleaders' views regarding ability.''   ``Organizations at all levels of a ruling party must shoulderthe responsibility of managing (non-party) officials,'' he said.   He also called for closer party involvement in the work ofChina's many ``mass organizations,'' including labor unions andwomen's assocations, ``so that they can follow the right politicaldirection.''</TEXT></DOC>
