Gorbachev's image flickered on theblack-and-white television screen, a translator's voice muffling theSoviet president's strenuous defense of new Soviet laws on Jewishemigration.   ``He's just repeating the same things we've heard already,''muttered Manashir Ifraimov, one of thousands of Soviet immigrantssettled in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn.   Like other emigres in this vibrant community dubbed ``LittleOdessa,'' he paid casual but constant attention to the events acrossthe East River on Wednesday, as Gorbachev spoke to the UnitedNations and toured Manhattan during a visit shortened by anearthquake in the southern Soviet Union.   ``We've heard these words. Now he has to make them real,''Ifraimov said.   Ifraimov, an economist-turned-butcher who emigrated two monthsago from Soviet Azerbaijan, turned from the TV to finish slicing acustomer's ham.   ``People are accustomed to a lot of talking, but people don'talways believe it,'' Ifraimov said. ``They are used to living withpromises. They just want their kids to have a better life.''   New York's Soviet immigrants differed in their degree of optimismabout the visiting leader's reforms. But many lauded glasnost _Gorbachev's policy of openness _ for enabling them and theirfamilies to leave or travel from the Soviet Union more freely thanever imagined.   ``I would not leave if I was there now,'' said Rimma Melik, ownerof the popular Kavkas Restaurant, who emigrated here in 1978 and hasvisited her family in the Soviet Union twice in recent years.   Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika, his program of economic andsocial restructuring, have played well even among stalwart criticswho insist the reforms are little more than a publicity stunt.   ``People are not getting better. Housing and roads are fallingapart,'' said Sophia Perett, executive director of the Center ForRussian Immigrants. ``People's main concern is to have food on thetable and to get by every month. For them nothing has changed.''   Still, there has been a very real increase in tourist and exitvisas, she said. The last large wave of emigration ended in 1979with detente.   Last year some 1,500 immigrants received tourist visas throughthe People's Travel Club, said Leon Kogan, manager of the agency'sBrighton Beach branch. Other travel agents reported similarincreases, a sign of the times under Gorbachev's glasnost.   ``We expect the number to be higher this year,'' he said.   Groups of rabbis, artists, writers, students and performers arestreaming in and out of the Soviet Union, singing the praises of``Gorbachevism,'' as one new emigre book labels it.   Mrs. Melik agreed that living conditions in the Soviet Union havenot changed. But she said Gorbachev has reignited hope for thefuture, a feeling she said means the difference between staying orleaving.   She said Soviet scientists and professionals, the kind Gorbachevneeds to reshape his country, will decide to stay when conditionsimprove.   ``Most important is that people love their Motherland. People whohad to wait 10 to 20 years are now more free to show their work. Andthey will make this country, if they will be allowed. It will be agreat county,'' she said.   Emigrants give Gorbachev credit more for what could happen thanwhat has happened, realizing much also depends on relations with theUnited States.   ``I support any contact, even negative contact,'' said Ifraimov,whose brother arrived in New York last week after waiting just twomonths for an exit visa.   When asked what he would say if Gorbachev was standing right infront of his butcher counter, Ifraimov didn't hesitate a moment.   ``I'd say, `You're on the right course.' ''</TEXT></DOC>
