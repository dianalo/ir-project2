(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham LambertInc.'s ``junk bond'' chief who's at the center of a federalinsider-trading probe, says the nearly 2-year-old investigation hastaken a personal toll.   ``The last 20 months have been very painful. The strain has beenenormous,'' Milken said in a rare interview published in TheTrentonian newspaper Friday.   ``Am I operating at my fullest capacity? No. Will my life beshorter? Possibly. I don't know how many more wrinkles there are onmy heart.''   Drexel, Milken and three other key employees were accused Sept. 7by the Securities and Exchange Commission of insider trading, stockmanipulation and other civil fraud charges. Criminal charges alsohave been expected since federal prosecutors notified Drexel earlierthis month that it was the target of a grand jury investigation.   The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.   The investigation stems from disclosures by stock speculator IvanBoesky, who paid the SEC a record $100 million in 1986 to settleinsider trading charges and is serving a 3-year prison term forconspiring to lie to the agency.   Milken declined to discuss the charges in the interview,stressing instead what he called his deep affection for his familyand extensive philanthropic activities.   A native Californian who is considered the pioneer of the $100billion market for high-yield securities known as junk bonds, Milkenis known for working 12-hour days, seven days a week, and reportedlymakes $40 million a year.   But he said professional milestones pale in significance to ason's problems with seizures and his father's bout with cancer.   ``My first bond issue?'' he asked. ``It was less satisfying thanfinding out what was wrong with (son) Greg, less satisfying thanlearning Lance (another son) was chosen valedictorian.''   A dream day, he added, ``would begin with my wife calling me tosays she's pregnant.''   His wife, Lori _ a high school sweetheart whom Milken married at22 _ remains fiercely proud and defensive of him.   ``I've told (the children), `Your father is a genius and hasrevolutionized the finance industry,''' she said in the interview.   ``People don't like change, and they're trying to get rid of yourfather, and if you look in your history books, you'll see thatpeople who have tried to make change have had this happen.''   The Trentonian is owned by Ingersoll Publications Co., whosechief executive, Ralph Ingersoll, is a friend of Milken's and aDrexel client.</TEXT></DOC>
