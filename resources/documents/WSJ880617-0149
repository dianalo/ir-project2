Beijing passed regulations in March telling state-owned trade corporations and manufacturers to make their own export and import plans. But the new freedom came with a price: Beijing no longer bails out companies reporting trading losses.    Foreign and Chinese businessmen have applauded the change as necessary if China is to move from a centrally planned economy to a freer-market economy.    Foreign traders believe the move will increase trade in the long term. But, many foreign businessmen say the deregulation has caused them problems because it has sparked a three-way struggle among the Chinese ministry handling foreign trade, provincial trading firms and manufacturers allowed to trade with foreigners.    &quot;The situation is rather chaotic now,&quot; says Yukiko Takemoto, Canton-based manager of Kanematsu-Gosho Ltd., a Japanese trading company.    Trade deregulation has proceeded in stop-and-go fashion in China since 1979, when provincial trading companies gradually took responsibilities from the central government's foreign-trading corporations.    The March measure took the reform a step further by making both the central and provincial trading concerns financially independent. &quot;It's China's biggest push in that direction so far,&quot; says Peng Pang, deputy director of Shenzhen's Trading Development Bureau.    Recently China scrapped a requirement that factory bosses had to seek approval before using the factory's own foreign earnings. In addition, since the beginning of the year, factories have been allowed to retain a bigger portion of foreign earnings. According to Canton trade officials, factories are now allowed to retain as much as 80% of their foreign income once they have exceeded their government-imposed export target. The rest is passed on to the state.    These recent changes and the big improvement of China's balance of trade last year have greatly encouraged foreign suppliers. The country's trade deficit shrank to $3.7 billion in 1987 from $12 billion in 1986.    &quot;The feeling is business is generally getting better this year,&quot; says Cecilia Tse, manager of Jardine Matheson (China) Ltd.'s Canton office.    But that doesn't mean life is any easier for foreign traders.    For example, try selling equipment in Canton. In the past, government trade officials and trading corporations used to decide for factories what equipment they should buy. Now, factories have more latitude, but as a safeguard against abuses, government officials require factories to process big procurement contracts through an official tendering company.    Many factories, unwilling to be left out on the final decision-making, insist on the right to screen the foreign suppliers first and produce the short list for the Chinese tendering company charged with making the final decision.    &quot;So, you end up cultivating relationships with the factory, its supervising government unit, the tendering company and the trading company because you don't know which one has the final say,&quot; says a Canton-based foreign trader, who declined to be identified.    While Beijing is content to leave routine operational decisions to factory managers, it has imposed new controls to check their powers, such as the enforcement of export and import licenses. Last January, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade added 26 items to the list of products requiring export licenses, bringing the total to 257.    &quot;There is a pattern in China's deregulating its economy,&quot; says Ms. Tse of Jardine Matheson. &quot;It loosens up controls in one area but tightens in another area. In the end, you don't know whether you've gained or lost from the deregulation.&quot;    Although traders live with export and import restrictions in any country, the situation in China is aggravated by the large number of controls.    Beijing recently decided to restrict imports of compressors for refrigerators in an attempt to curb speculation on the machines. Now, instead of speculation in compressors, there is speculation in compressor import licenses. The documents are being traded at $50 apiece, $20 more than a compressor costs. The only beneficiaries are those people, often children of senior cadres, who have access to documents, the Canton-based trader says.    Trade deregulation, meanwhile, has spawned a new crop of companies eager to export. Last April, for example, Wanbao Electrical banded together with more than 30 other home-appliance companies in Guangdong Province to form a consortium for international sales.&quot;In the U.S., there is General Electric,&quot; says a Wanbao official. &quot;China is a bigger country but there is no equivalent company. We're working at it, although we're still a long way off.&quot;    Canton, which enjoys a more advanced stage of deregulation than any other Chinese city, has allowed about 50 factories to export directly. Canton trade officials say many more will be given the same right this year.    Mr. Takemoto, the Canton manager for Kanematsu-Gosho, says he receives on average two to three new groups of prospective Chinese traders a day.    &quot;Doing business in China used to be simple. The country was like one big corporation. Now there are thousands of companies,&quot; he says.    But some of those companies may not be around this time next year. Many companies are suffering from steep losses despite a rapid growth in export sales. Wanbao, for example, has been losing money on its export sales every year since 1983, the first year it began exporting. It has been hemorrhaging cash mainly because Beijing refuses to weaken the strong yuan. </TEXT></DOC>
