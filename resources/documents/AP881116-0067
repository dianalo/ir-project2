On Wednesday, Fuller and Teeter released a complete list of their11 deputies, plus their responsibilities at the transition office.Some had been named earlier.   ``We're engaged in a takeover, but a friendly takeover ... andwhat we are all about is trying to have a smooth and efficienttransition so we can put a Bush administration in place on or soonafter Jan. 20,'' Fuller told reporters.   The roughly 100 people hired by the transition office arewell-situated to land big jobs in the Bush administration, butFuller said no promises have been made for future employment.   The task at hand is to chose people for some 5,000 political jobsopen in 1989 as well as development policies for Bush.   Key transition people under Fuller and Teeter are J.
