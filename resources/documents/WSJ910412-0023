The decision by panel Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas)and Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie, ranking Republican member,sharply reduces the likelihood that Congress will pass thebroad banking-law revisions that the administration and mostlarge banks say are necessary to make the banking industrymore competitive and profitable.</LP><TEXT>   In February, the Treasury proposed a plan that would allowbank affiliates to enter the securities and insurancebusiness, permit banks to branch nationwide, restructure thebank regulatory system, limit the coverage of depositinsurance, and allow commercial companies to own banks.   Rather than push for such an ambitious -- andcontroversial -- program this year, the two committee leadersdecided to concentrate on passing a bill that would augmentthe shrinking bank insurance fund, tighten bank regulation,and limit the scope of deposit-insurance coverage.   Mr. Wylie conceded that the decision to focus on theinsurance fund will &quot;diminish the immediate prospects ofpassage&quot; for a broader bill. &quot;I'll work for the Treasurybill, but I'm very realistic&quot; about the obstacles it faces,he said.   Committee member Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.) said theinformal agreement reflects a conclusion that &quot;we must ensurethat the bank deposit insurance fund doesn't become bankruptand place a further burden on the nation's taxpayers. Once wehave taken care of that problem, we must then turn ourattention to the task of bolstering the financial-servicesindustry. This may be easier said than done.&quot;   Next week, committee leaders hope &quot;to explore where theconsensus is&quot; on a plan that splits efforts to strengthen thefund from more contentious issues, a banking panel staffersaid.   Many banking lobbyists and industry officials have fearedjust such a development -- a bill that would boostdeposit-insurance premiums for the bank insurance fund andtighten regulation without giving banks the powers to engagein securities and other businesses.   &quot;It is very irresponsible for Congress to refuse toconsider&quot; a revamping of the industry, said Thomas Theobald,chairman of Continental Bank Corp., Chicago. &quot;It's time tostop the competitive erosion of American banks. This is anindustry just as big as the auto industry and has the same30% foreign penetration. Why doesn't Congress care as muchabout banks as the auto industry?&quot;   Thomas Hanley, senior banking analyst of Salomon BrothersInc., said, &quot;Clearly, this is a step backward for banking ata time when we need to move forward.&quot;   Banking consultants also were troubled by the move.William Isaac, managing director of Secura Group, aWashington, D.C., bank consulting firm, and former chairmanof the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said, &quot;This is whatwe have been fearing and have been telling our clients islikely since just after the Treasury Department issued itsproposal.&quot;   &quot;Delay is wrong,&quot; said Edward Furash, a Washington, D.C.,bank consultant. Mr. Furash said Mr. Gonzales &quot;is doing tothe banking industry what happened to the Sandamp;Ls in 1983 whenreal solutions were put off. The net effect of his positionis to make the banking industry more destabilized. It'sshortsighted. The industry should be very angry.&quot;   As part of its bank-restructuring plan, the administrationhas proposed a $70 billion program to shore up the bankinsurance fund with new borrowing lines from the Treasury andthe Federal Reserve Board. The loans would be paid back overa period of years through premiums paid by banks. The BankingCommittee leaders believe that quick action to recapitalizethe fund is necessary to boost confidence in the bankingsystem.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman explained the complexrecapitalization plan to the banking panel. He said that thenew borrowing authority should be enough to get the fundthrough the current problems in the banking industry withoutthe infusion of any taxpayer funds.   However, he stressed that it was important for Congress topass other measures -- such as expanded business powers forbank affiliates -- that would strengthen the bankingindustry. He also urged regulatory changes to protect thebank insurance fund from further loss.   One change -- a greater focus on bank capital or net worth-- is included in the Treasury proposal. In addition, Mr.Seidman called for two things that go beyond the Treasuryplan: greater regulatory power for the FDIC and a return toearlier limits on real-estate lending by banks.   He said that laws repealed by Congress in 1974 and 1982prohibited banks from making loans on raw land, blockedconstruction loans on projects unless the builder contributedat least a 25% equity interest, and limited overallconcentration in real-estate lending by national banks.   &quot;Many of the loans that have cost the FDIC the most moneywould have been illegal prior to 1974,&quot; he said. &quot;It's timefor insured institutions to return to old-fashioned standardsof safe-and-sound banking. The restrictions lifted byCongress in 1974 and 1982 should be reinstated.&quot;   The House Banking Committee is fractious andunpredictable. A decision by Reps. Gonzalez and Wylie tofocus initially on recapitalization, deposit-insurancechanges and provisions that would allow regulators tointervene more aggressively to prevent bank failures doesn'tmean that members won't try to broaden the bill. One likelyaddition would be authority to allow banks to operatenationwide branch systems.   Last month, the panel fumbled a $78 billion funding planfor the savings-and-loan cleanup, and its leaders want to doa better job on the bank recapitalization plan. Reps.Gonzalez and Wylie would like to complete work on the bankplan before having to deal with another funding request forthe Resolution Trust Corp., the Sandamp;L cleanup agency.</TEXT></DOC>
